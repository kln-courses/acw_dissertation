<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iconoclasm as Discourse: From Antiquity to Byzantium Jas Eisner Byzantine iconoclasm remains of perennial interest to the historian, the theologian, and the historian of art. The sub ject appears to be well attested by documentary sources— only for us to find these extremely and intriguingly difficult to use, since they are largely couched in a theologically or hagiographically inflected language of apology and polemic that is not only very distant from modern habits of mind but also nearly impossible to pin down in factual terms. The result has been a plethora of explanations—indeed, what was already in the 1970s branded "a crisis of over-explanation."1 Clearly, the advent of iconoclasm in Byzantium partakes of a multistranded series of causes,2 which are perhaps impossible to unpack in their entirety, some of them proximate and some belonging to a very long historical process. Moreover, because the issues are so fraught around a topic of such central religious importance to the cultural history (and his toriography) of Western Europe,s the attraction for scholars of every religious persuasion (Protestant, Catholic, Ortho dox, not to speak of Jewish) as well as of no persuasion, or even of militantly secular atheism, is compelling. Both key concepts in my title, "iconoclasm" and "dis course," are controversial. To take the second first, I am indebted to Averil Cameron's work on the development of Christian discourse, but my definition necessarily differs from her formulation "all the rhetorical strategies and manners of expression that I take to be particularly characteristic of Christian writing," since I am concerned with characteristics as much material and cultural as rhetorical or literary.4 My focus is on images, their making and breaking (and stories, often fictional, of such making and breaking), and only partially on writing. My interest extends, for comparative reasons, to a scope and range of activity that are not exclu sively Christian. Some parallels to the discursive nature of iconoclasm in the late antique and Byzantine context may be found in the study of the European Reformation, whose iconoclasm has been characterized as "an expected cultural routine" in which both art and its experience are "preceded and succeeded by iconoclasm."5 The advantage of the model of discourse is that it includes, without prejudicing one be fore the other, both theory and practice. Scholars tend to emphasize either practices of image veneration over the the ology that appears to justify them, or intellectualist theolog ical positions over the acts of devotion that may have pre ceded the theory but certainly also came to depend on it. By cultural discourse, I mean in part the mutual reinforcement of theory and practice, with each implying and underpinning the other, although, of course, they may reflect different social and cultural milieus, depending on the literacy and education of those concerned. The term iconoclasm carries many meanings—from a pe riod in Byzantine history,6 via a set of events that are meant to have occurred at that time, to a form of activity involving damage to images at any time and place in human history. I will use it specifically to mean physical attack on images within the Greco-Roman-Byzantine world, from archaic an tiquity up to and including the period known as the Icono clastic era in Byzantium. But my interest is in how the process of theorizing both iconoclasm and the iconophile response to it enabled a long tradition of thinking about what an image was, a tradition going back deep into pre-Classical Greek antiquity, to come to a clear and mature conceptual position on the issue of the relation of a visual image to the model or prototype that it imitated through representation. The range of positions on the nature of images offered during Byzantine iconoclasm constitutes a fundamental conceptual contribu tion to the problem of image as representation as it devel oped in the Western tradition. In my reading, the conceptual developments of Byzantine iconoclasm—cast as theological arguments in a deep dispute that had numerous entailments in politics, society, and ritual—are the final completion of the process of philosophical thinking about images in the Greco Roman heritage. What came to matter is that a particular form of image—the icon of Christ—should have been taken (perhaps invented, or deemed necessary) for the job of hav ing been destroyed. The justifications of, recriminations about, and responses to this destruction from all sides in the dispute were in themselves revealing of theoretical positions (explicit or implied) about representation as well as of changes and developments in such positions at a key point of transition between antiquity and the Middle Ages. In a deep way, much of how one interprets the subject and formulates the questions depends on the disciplinary frame from which one starts. Historians have tended to be inter ested in proximate or immediate as opposed to long-term causes, theologians in the span of argument reaching back to the early church. One of the dividing lines in interpretation is whether we should see the question of images, which our sources stress, as central to iconoclasm or as a form of cul tural sublimation for a range of other problems and anxie ties.7 Needless to say, as an art historian, I will take the internalist emphasis on the image, and the understanding of what was an appropriate sacred image in the context of a long history of such images, to be central. A second great division is whether we should see Byzantine iconoclasm in a relatively narrow historical context as the result of watershed develop ments of the seventh century or in a much longer time frame, reaching back into early Christianity or even pagan antiqui ty8—that is, whether we highlight proximate causes or longer term processes. The profound discussion, ongoing for at least half a century, about when exactly the rise of the cult of images, or its intensification, in Byzantium took place is precisely a debate about this issue, since iconoclasm is always seen (and surely rightly) as in part a response to the religious devotion to icons. If you see the cult of images as taking a</page><page sequence="2">ICONOCLASM AS DISCOURSE: FROM ANTIQUITY TO BYZANTIUM 359 significant step forward in the sixth,9 or the seventh,10 or the later seventh century,11 or even within and as a result of iconoclasm itself,12 then you circumscribe (to use a nice iconoclastic term) the appropriate historical limits of the inquiry. It is worth noting at the outset that all parties in the arguments for and against images (that is, our sources) are very keen on situating themselves within the tongue duree—not only of Christian history but also of the pagan and Jewish sources, which the early church fathers and apologists both cited and refuted.13 The range of citations is extremely complex for us to handle because all have done violence to their original con text, which in many cases no longer survives except for what is offered by the citation, and the text's original meaning, through the process of selection and excision. Some have been significantly adapted (which may involve being wildly interpreted or rewritten, by our standards), some have been forged outright. To criticize such varieties of fabrication is, of course, to apply anachronistic standards of scholarly objec tivity and source criticism to a rhetorical culture whose con cern was persuasion within a polemically and apologetically inflected model of discourse, where the florilegium occupied something of the authority in valorizing the arguments made that the substructure of footnotes has today in scholarly writing.1'1 Moreover, such anthologies constituted an ex tremely ancient forum for conducting learned, scholarly, and philosophical discussions, and they have to be read with respect for their genre.15 The issue raised by such anthologies is not so much authenticity or accuracy as authority—al though each party could indeed undermine the authority of his opponents' arguments by questioning their authenticity. However, for my purposes (and I write unashamedly as a Clas sicist interloper in the history of Byzantine art), in taking a tongue duree approach, it may be said that the tongue duree model is at least in part based on an internalist view of the place of Byzantine iconoclasm in the long Christian culture of the Ro man Empire, as adopted by all sides in the controversy. I have to come clean that my approach, in concentrating largely on attitudes formulated in Constantinople, is metro politan and reductive in that it does not treat the full scope of views and actions across the Byzantine world (let alone the West or Islam). Clearly, the variety of positions and responses in the eastern Mediterranean (especially the world that had been Byzantine until the mid-seventh century but was by the eighth under the political control of Muslim conquer ors)—in Egypt and Syria, in languages like Coptic, Syriac, and Armenian as well as Greek, in Jewish, pre-Islamic, and Muslim as well as Christian cultures—would add a vast and variegated richness to the story. There is no doubt that at least two gestures from the East—the anti-imagistic acts of the early eighth-century caliphs and the theological defense of images conducted by Saint John of Damascus—had a significant effect on players in the Byzantine imperial center. However, my reason for focusing mainly on Constantinople—on church councils, their surrounding theology, and their pro nouncements—is that this is where most of the key Christian theorizations of the image took place. One core point needs to be emphasized. Iconoclasm in all premodern contexts from antiquity to the Byzantine icono clastic controversy was about "real presence."1 The damage done to the image is an attack on its prototype, at least until Byzantine iconoclasm, and it presupposes some kind of as sault on real presence as contained in the image.1' This has proved hard for many modern thinkers to accept—not least because real presence in pre-Christian antiquity was both as sumed and undertheorized, so that ancient theorists would not have been entirely clear (should they have thought to ask) in what sense, to what extent, and in what way a person's memory or a god's divinity was contained inside an image. It is my contention that part of the contribution of Byzantine icono clasm (by which I mean arguments advanced by both icono phobes and iconophiles) was to help clarify these questions. My specific aim here in setting some of the issues into a tongue duree historical context is to show how the overt and conceptually astute reconsideration of a series of ancient problems about images, worship, and theology could be transformative for how those problems came to resonate in the succeeding culture. The age-old themes, to which I argue the Iconoclastic era addressed itself, resonate on several lev els. First, there are the fundamental questions of representa tion, real presence, animation, and worship in relation to images, which can be traced back to archaic antiquity.18 Not heavily theorized in antiquity, these come through largely as instinctive attitudes and responses among those who used images, especially in a religious or epiphanic context.19 But it needs to be said that some aspects of representation had been theorized much earlier—especially in the accounts of mimesis by Plato and Aristotle, the variety of takes on these theories (some philosophically serious and many playful) in the Hellenistic and Roman eras, and especially the theories and practices of statue animation among the Neoplatonists,20 which certainly underscored divine presence in images. These are models of thought and argument that proved influential on the church fathers right up to iconoclasm.21 Second, the Iconoclastic period was preceded by a long his tory of image breaking as a legal sanction in the Roman system (in both the republic and the empire), which cannot be entirely separated from assumptions about real presence in images. Third, the particular interpretative takes that Christianity, partly in relation to its Jewish heritage, brought to this twofold problematic (as did Islam in a later and different context) were inherited from polytheistic antiquity. Within this thought world, reaching back to the pre-Socrat ics in Greece and to ancient Judaism, pretty well every possi ble position—iconic, aniconic, anti-iconic—had been tried. We are looking, in the developments of the sixth to the ninth centuries, less at innovations than at reformulations, nuances, and changed emphases. This is the case in terms not only of expressed views about images but also of varieties of ritual, image cultivation (which includes all forms of devotion to im ages, from the uses of kissing, candle lighting, and worship to dressing, framing, covering, and exposing them), and practiced religion, which are rarely overtly theoretical but always carry the thrust of an implicit theological perspective. The Longue Duree: Representation and Real Presence, Memoria and Memory Sanctions Let us take these three areas one by one. First, the problem of representation and especially the question of whether an</page><page sequence="3">370 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 3 image, as an imitation of its referent in a pictorial medium, is not the same as its referent and thereby expresses the absence of that referent even as it refers to it, or whether it is a site for the real presence of its prototype, embodied in the image.22 Both attitudes were common in antiquity—even if we may think them contradictory—and the questions they raised were never fully resolved. From the beginnings of the earliest Christian art in the third century CE, the theme of presence and absence remained in play. In all periods characterized by the hegemonic religious dominance of pagan polytheism and Christianity, the main marker of real presence is the cultiva tion of images: that is, a matter of particular practices—the use of images as items in ritual, their place as recipients of ritual, even of worship, their ability to embody a kind of charisma as a result of or in response to such cultivation. Notably, the violent denial of the appropriateness of such cultivation—namely, the act of iconoclasm—is itself often a tribute to the perceived power and potency of real presence inside an image.23 There is no doubt at all that part of the problematic of Byzantine iconoclasm in the eighth and ninth centuries was a very direct concern with real presence in the icon, but my point is that this concern was a very old one, reaching back to archaic times. Second, in the Roman world, the potency of images to carry at least some aspects of a person's presence into pos terity, through his or her memoria, made them a prime object of memory sanctions as early as the Middle Republic.24 In her recent history of this theme, Harriet Flower traces the ways that a disgraced aristocrat could be denied a funerary mask or the accompaniment of the masks of his ancestors at his burial,25 how the banning of all portraits in all media and all locations came to accompany the postmortem penalties im posed on enemies of the state,26 how by the Late Republic various conflicts between different aristocrats and factions in Rome were conducted through the creation, veneration, and destruction of images.27 By the time the Principate was in full swing after Augustus, a discourse of image destruction and memory erasure for those who were rivals or former favorites of emperors, including women, became normal, rising to special and comprehensive treatment in the destruction, de molition, and recutting of portraits in the cases of disgraced former emperors.28 Such destruction—going frequently by the modern name of damnatio memoriae in scholarship29— involved all kinds of monuments and inscriptions but cen tered on statues, which might be demolished, or have their heads recut, or simply have new inscriptions added to replace those of the disgraced (or a combination of the last two).30 The discourse rapidly became highly sophisticated, with sig nificant differences in representation between a complete airbrushing of the condemned to leave the impression that he or she had never existed versus a marked erasure making it quite clear that the condemned should be noted and remembered as condemned.81 In the case of the destruction of multiple statues of one individual, it appears that by late antiquity one or two examples were usually allowed to re main; to be effective, the attack on memory had to tolerate exceptions so that the condemnation itself would be remem bered.32 The development of a discourse of iconoclasm in the Roman world—that is, the erasure of images in response to condem nation of memory—is extremely important for the context of the cult of images and its oppositions in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. While scholarly work on Byzantine icono clasm has explored most aspects of the controversy, from the artistic to the sociopolitical,33 the status of iconoclasm as a discourse in Byzantine society and culture has hardly been touched. By the word "discourse," I mean an exchange or communication between two or more parties in a society, in which all the parties concerned understand the rules by which they are playing. In this sense, a discourse is rather like a game of Monopoly: it implies the complicity of the people involved in playing the game, even if they are playing against one another. On this definition of iconoclasm as a discourse, we find that it recurs as a normal strategy in both ecclesiastical and imperial politics outside the period generally defined as "Iconoclastic" and reaching back through Byzantine history to Roman practices of damnatio memoriae. On the fall of an emperor, it was normal practice to order that his images be removed (or, particularly if his throne had been usurped, destroyed) and to replace them with images of the new Basileus. In fact, such a political strategy is not at all surpris ing, given that the Byzantines believed that the image of the emperor in some sense was the emperor and that the honor offered to it was transmitted to its model (the emperor himself).34 No new usurping Basileus would want his prede cessor's image—which is not simply a memory but a very presence—interfering with his own reign. Parallel to this political iconoclasm of the destruction and replacement of imperial images is a persistent trend of religious iconoclasm in the early Byzantine period, in which ecclesiastical politics was conducted in part through a discourse of destroying and setting up images. The sixth-century Syriac historian John of Ephesus records that images of Monophysite church fathers were replaced "everywhere" by those of John III Scholasticus, the patriarch of Constantinople (r. 565-77), and that on John's death his portraits were replaced by those of Euty chius, his predecessor and successor on the patriarchal throne. John of Ephesus certainly accepted this iconoclastic strategy as normal in ecclesiastical politics.35 More striking still is the evidence of Deacon Agathon on the rampant politico-theological iconoclasm of the early eighth century. In 712, before his solemn entry into the city of Constantinople, the new Monothelete emperor of Byzan tium, Philippicus Bardanes, ordered the destruction of the image (in the vestibule of the imperial palace) of the Sixth Ecumenical Council (681-82), which had anathematized Monotheletism. Further, he replaced it with images of Patri arch Sergius I of Constantinople (r. 610-38) and Pope Hono rius I (r. 625-38), who had accepted Monotheletism and been anathematized by the Sixth Council. In addition, he placed images of the first five ecumenical councils (accom panied by images of himself and Sergius) in the vault of the Milion, the great domed mile-marker monument that re corded distances across the empire from the imperial center at Constantinople, arguing through this continuity of concil iar images that his faith was the true Orthodox faith and asserting by his act of iconoclasm that the Sixth Council was heretical.36 This is a formidable testimony to the power of the image in the early medieval period. In a sense, the gist of</page><page sequence="4">ICONOCLASM AS DISCOURSE: FROM ANTIQUITY TO BYZANTIUM V)h]\ Philippicus's religious and political stances was presented in terms of what images had been set up and what destroyed. His successor, Emperor Anastasius, as a proclamation of his Orthodoxy, proceeded to destroy all the images of Philippi cus, Honorius, and Sergius, to replace that of the Sixth Council in the palace vestibule, and to add the Sixth Council to the other five in the Milion. Again, we see images and their destruction proclaiming policy. Anastasius, while utterly de nying the theology of his predecessor, nevertheless accepted wholeheartedly the strategy of his discourse. Scholars attempting to explain the cult of icons in Byzan tium have had frequent recourse to these topics—especially the cult of the imperial image—as an explanatory factor.37 The point here is that Byzantine society (up to and including the period known as Iconoclastic) conducted its public ges tures of political action and power through a discourse of images related both to the dominance of particular emperors or bishops and to the ascendancy of particular theological positions adopted by the ruling party. This discourse is the developed and the developing form of discursive practices in the late Republic and early Principate, themselves derived from ancient civic and cult traditions in the Mediterranean world.38 A scintillating example of where the cultural politics of iconoclasm and of representation coincide, in the Helle nistic world, is offered by an inscription of the fourth century BCE from Delphi. In an act of liquidating the past, the Delphians recorded their payments to Eucrates (eight drach mas and three obols) to remove (exagagein) from the precinct (exos hierou) the bases (bathra) and the images (eikonas) of the Phocian generals Onomarchus and Philomelus, who had earlier ransacked the sanctuary.39 Further, they agree to pay Cleon seven drachmas to destroy (anelein) the horses (hip pous) and the statues of the men (andriantas),40 In play—as early as the 340s BCE—is the kind of iconoclasm we find continuously in Byzantium until the eighth century CE: that is, the political and public announcement of condemnation of enemies and simultaneously the assertion of identity by the destroyer. The act of iconoclasm is accompanied by the need to record its effect so that the act of forgetting will be remem bered (found here in a sanctuary inscription excavated by the French in 1894) and by a remarkable linguistic emphasis on the eikon. The eikon is described as separate from its base (which carries the inscription identifying the two condemned Phocians) and from the specific elements that make it up— namely, the bronze equestrian statues of the two generals, which are described as "horses" and andriantas, which is a word one would normally render as "statues" but must mean here the statues of the men as opposed to the horses. The Delphic inscription divides the iconoclastic process into re moving and destroying, giving different elements to different executors at different sums. It also shows—more than a mil lennium before the iconoclastic controversy in Byzantium—a potential for systematic and analytic thought about what an eikon is and what its constituents are. The Longue Duree: Judeo-Christian Positions Late antiquity witnessed a significant change in the particular problematic of Christian attitudes to idolatry, inherited from Jewish Scripture and possibly some strands of Jewish prac tice,41 and the complications of this problematic in relation both to pagan images (which were themselves, of course, by definition idols) and Christian images (which might or might not be). It should be said that Jewish and Christian positions differ from pagan polytheist ones in terms of the weight accorded to dogma, since pagan religion is more open-ended theologically, perhaps largely because so litde is written down. The traditional view42 that the early church was hostile to the visual arts43 has been strongly resisted in the last generation.41 The modern consensus is that the attacks on idols by the early fathers and Christian apologists are primar ily directed against pagan polytheist practices in the Greco Roman environment rather than against the Christian culti vation of religious images.45 But strong versions of the modern view need a certain amount of nuance.46 We possess patristic writings, such as the letter of Epiphanius of Salamis to John of Jerusalem (and a number of other works by Epiphanius, who died in 403 CE), that represent the doubts of at least one significant fourth-century bishop and distin guished theologian as to the appropriateness of image wor ship by Christians (as well as attesting to its widespread prac tice) and articulate an iconophobic if not fully iconoclastic position—although Epiphanius tore down a curtain inside a church decorated, as he tells us, "with an image of Christ or one of the saints."47 This text and others—such as the letter of Eusebius (263-339, bishop of Caesarea and Constantine's biographer) to Constantine's half sister Constantia arguing against the use of an image of Christ—may be forgeries contrived by the iconoclasts in a much later period as patristic evidence for their position,48 but they may also be genuine.49 It seems to me reasonable to argue that on the theoretical and philosophical level, the early church (if we may use that generalization for the variety and range of locally, ritually, doctrinally, and linguistically diverse Christianities) had no consistent view on the matter of images.50 As in Judaism, a certain low-level iconophobic unease, rooted in, or at least justifiable through Scripture, could easily manifest on occa sion. What Christians certainly did not do is to elevate images to the level of Scripture, because that is what Mani, the Manichean prophet (ca. 216-276) had done,51 and perhaps some other Gnostic sects.52 Yet the range of attitudes, from strong approval at one end of the spectrum to resistance at the other, appears to have been as broad as the range of practices, from the worship of Christian images to their tear ing down and destruction. At the same time, a number of Early Christian texts—both pre-Constantinian and fourth-century (like the Epiphanus examples just cited)—appear also to give evidence of signif icant image cultivation by people who saw themselves as Christians. Notably, as early as the second century CE, the apocryphal Acts of John reports that a portrait (eikon) of the apostle is worshiped in private with garlands and candles.53 Likewise, in the same period, Irenaeus of Lyons railed against Carpocratian Gnostics (and we must ask in what sense are such people not to count as Christians?), who venerated images not only of Jesus but also of various ancient philoso phers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle.54 On the level of material culture, we have no images from the early period that we can definitively prove to have been devotional icons, but equally, we cannot prove any of our surviving images were not usable as icons for veneration by someone. We have some</page><page sequence="5">372 art bulletin September 2012 volume xciv number 3 1 Gold glass medallion of Saint Agnes in the orans posture, between doves, 4th century CE. Pamphilus Catacomb, Rome (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Pontificia Commissione di Archeologia Sacra, Rome) portraits of saints (for example, the gold glass medallions of Christ and a number of saints from the Roman catacombs, Fig. I)55 that have no obvious narrative context. There is every possibility that these kinds of images were put to private devotional use, whether in a funerary context, where the surviving materials were found, in a liturgical space, or in the domestic arena.01' Such Christian images appear to have pa gan precursors—not only in the devotions performed before portraits57 but also in the corpus of votive or cult panels depicting deities or heroes, of which more than fifty survive from late antiquity and which are currently being assembled into a corpus (Fig. 2).58 The early evidence is important. Since the 1970s it has been assumed that the "rise of the cult of icons in the sixth and seventh centuries [Figs. 3, 4], and not the origins of Iconoclasm, ... is the central problem of the Iconoclast Con troversy."59 This model of historical explanation (based on proximate causes—that is, a posited recent rise in the cult of icons—and in opposition to longue duree causes, such as the persistence of forms of damnatio memoriae) is fundamentally realist. That is, it assumes that because we have more textual evidence about the cult of images for the sixth to the eighth 2 Panel of a bearded god in military dress with halo (the Thracian god Heron?), 2nd or 3rd century CE, tempera on wooden panel, 15V6 X 10 in.

Mathews) centuries, it means there really was more of a cult of images in that period rather than a shift in what texts decided to highlight: a shift, in other words, in rhetoric rather than reality. I do not myself see any reason for preferring reality to rhetoric as an interpretative historical move in this context, given the rich earlier evidence—up to the third and fourth centuries, say—for varieties of image cultivation, both pagan and Christian. The choice to privilege realism is a value judgment, and I myself would prefer to leave the matter open. It is possible there was no rise in the cult of images, just a rise in the textual noise about the cult in the materials that have survived to us.60 The mix of attitudes in the relations of Christians to images and worship, that is, to the complex arena where idolatry might be seen as a problem,61 encompasses not only their own images but also those of the pagan environment.1'" From the fourth century and certainly the fifth—the moment of Christian hegemonic ascendancy—there is plenty of evi dence, both literary and in the archaeological record, for Christian destruction of pagan idols and sanctuaries.63 Yet</page><page sequence="6">ICONOCLASM AS DISCOURSE: FROM ANTIQUITY TO BYZANTIUM 373 evidence also exists that even cult images could be cared for with intense antiquarian enthusiasm—looked after, restored, collected, and brought to adorn the multiple private and public spaces of late antique Constantinople.64 The extent to which such images were successfully stripped of their reli gious meanings and pagan connotations is moot, and cer tainly in the course of Byzantine history, such ancient dedi cations were always capable of showing demonic possession.br&gt; There is even evidence—in the case of the Parthenon it self—of the same monument being both the target for Chris tian iconoclasm and the object of a long history of antiquar ian affection and preservation.66 3 Icon of Christ with a jeweled Gospel book adorned with a cross, 6th century, wax encaustic on wooden panel, 33% X 17% X in.

In the first place, it involves not simply the breaking but also the setting up of images: it is a process of creation as much as destruction. Second, the strategy surely reflects the impact of images as a major form of propaganda and polemic on both the political and ecclesiastical levels, and, for numerous church fathers East and West as well as even the iconoclast emperors Mi chael II and Theophilus (in their letter to Louis the Pious in 824), a crucial didactic tool.67 In effect, what this implies is that the discourse of the image—or rather, the use of images as a discourse in society to make statements that were heavily loaded, either politically or theologically—was prevalent and</page><page sequence="7">374 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 3 5 Gold solidus of Justinian II: obverse showing the imperial portrait; reverse showing the true cross on steps, minted in Constantinople before 692.

Specific archaeological evidence points to the relatively sophisticated and subtle uses of images in the seventh and eighth centuries as part of the discourse of international politics, especially in the paintings surviving from the seventh and eighth centuries in the church of S. Maria Antiqua in Rome.68 This material is strongly supportive of the impor tance of images as a means of discourse not only in Constanti nople but also among the church hierarchy of the West. The most impressive argument for the power of image discourse in the seventh century comes from the numismatic evidence. A "polemic of images" undoubtedly was carried on between the coin issues of Caliph 'Abd al-Malik and Justinian II in his first reign (Figs. 5-13).69 The caliph appears to have imitated the Byzantine coinage (Fig. 5) but to have changed Justini an's portrait on the face of the coin, borrowing from earlier Sassanian and Byzantine types, including the coinage of Em peror Heraclius (r. 610-41) (Fig. 6).70 On the back, Abd al-Malik replaced the cross—which always had the potential for devotional use among Christians (Fig. 7)—with the lance or scepter of the Prophet, whether on a stepped base or in an arched niche (Figs. 8, 9). The radical nature of Justinian's response can hardly be overestimated (Fig. 10). In a unique gesture, he replaced his own image on the coin's obverse with that of Christ, bearing the text "rex regnantium" (King of Kings). On the reverse, Justinian is represented as "servus christi" (Slave of Christ), itself possibly a Byzantine appropriation of an Arabic formu lation, since Abd is Arabic for "slave." Thus, Abd al-Malik means "slave of the chief' and Abdallah means "slave of God."71 It was unprecedented for a Byzantine emperor to be represented as a slave and on the back of a coin. Yet a slave of the King of Kings is better than one who rejects him altogether, and in terms of an image war, Justinian had won. There was no image that could outdo his. Abd al-Malik's initial response, an image, on both gold and cheaper alloy coins, of a standing figure with a sword or scabbard on the front of the coin, which may represent the caliph but may equally be intended to show the Prophet himself (Figs. 11, 12), gave way swifdy to a wholly aniconic coinage in which the use of images altogether was rejected (Fig. 13).

Although the papacy was pri marily occupied by Greeks in this period,74 its main congre gation was Latin-speaking. The caliphate was Arabic-speaking but operated in the seventh and eighth centuries in the broadly Syriac- and Greek-speaking Christian culture of con quered Syria and the Levant. Byzantium was, of course, Greek. But the question of the place of images in Islam is tantalizing. At the same time as the rise of Byzantine icono clasm, and in response to the same long dynamic of discur</page><page sequence="9">376 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 3 sive practices inherited from antiquity (that is, in part from Classical antiquity, but modulated by the Achaemenid, Par thian, and Sassanian models of imperial culture to the east), Islam also responded to the ancient image both with icono clasm and with a rethinking of the nature of what images should be and how they relate to the divine economy. Islam's choices and conceptual approaches would prove very differ ent from those of Byzantium. Effectively, Islam moved away from the figurative toward the decorative, away from the idolatrous dangers of real presence associated with the icon. By contrast, Byzantium would ultimately affirm real presence in response to the iconoclasts and develop a full visual econ omy of the icon.75 The fact that both cultures confronted the great inheritance of antiquity in this matter at the same time—and with such different results—remains fascinating and the reasons for it unresolved. Byzantine Iconoclasm and the Theorization of the Image: From the Ontology of the Icon to the Epistemology of Knowing God It is within this context of the regular creation and destruc tion of images as a visual discourse pervading the competition for imperial authority and religious doctrine (both within Christian factionalism and between Christianity and Islam) that we need to place the specific developments of Byzantine iconoclasm. The key issues have less to do with the cult of images as such or attacks on images than with two fundamen tal interruptions to the discursive structures that had pre vailed since before the beginnings of the Christian imperium. The first of these is the move to the full theorization of the image, both as a justification for images and as a justification for the attack on them. We may place this with the theological positions articulated by John of Damascus, writing at some point between 730 and 750 in defense of images, and by the iconoclast Council of Hiereia, which met in 754 and styled itself the Seventh Ecumenical Council. As usual in this game, the arguments of Hiereia do not survive in their own right but only as excerpted and represented by the opponents who anathematized everything the iconoclasts stood for—not ideal territory for objective assessments on our part. More to the point is that from both sides in the debate, images acquired a level of philosophical theorization to which they had never before been subjected in the entire tradition of Greco-Roman image making, reaching back to archaic antiq uity. From the art historian's point of view, and from that of anyone trying to understand the cultural significance of im ages in a society, this is a huge development. It meant that the discourse of images would never again be conducted without potential recourse to rigorous theological arguments and justifications, effectively a structure of pseudolegalistic prec edent, which would extend in somewhat different modula tions to the Western Roman Empire7'' and would, of course, come to be central to the arguments of the European Refor mation. Side by side with this fundamental shift—and hardly sepa rable from it—went a profound change in Byzantine theol ogy, which has been insufficiently stressed.'7 Byzantine eccle siastical life proceeded through a series of church councils, many of which claimed to be ecumenical and only seven of which were accorded that distinction by the tradition as it developed, but we may differentiate between the focus of the theological debates these councils were summoned to re solve. Until the iconoclast Council of Hiereia of 754 and the Council of Nicaea of 787, which reversed Hiereia's pro nouncements and justified images, the fundamental course of Byzantine theology in its church councils was primarily ontological—sorting out correct designations for the nature of God and attempting to find resolutions for disputes about such designations. Especially after the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451, which saw an ultimately irrep arable division of Christian communities between those who insisted on distinguishing two natures in the person of Christ (the Dyophysites, whom we call Orthodox) and those whom their opponents accused of accentuating the Divine Nature (whom we tend to call Monophysite or Miaphysite), there was huge political pressure to find compromises, such as Moner gism or Monotheletism.'* All of these attempt ever more precisely to define the ontological nature of Christ's being, which is also his relation to the other members of the Trinity. What has gone surprisingly unremarked, either in connec tion with the study of the development of Byzantine theology or the study of the theorization of images, is the significance of the shift in the eighth and ninth centuries to icons as the subject of theological dispute, not only at Hiereia and the Second Council of Nicaea but also in the iconoclast Council of 815 and the iconophile Council of 843, which resulted in the so-called Triumph of Orthodoxy. It signaled a change from an emphasis on ontology (that is, the being of God) to a greater accent on epistemology (that is, how God is to be known). This is no less substantive and meaningful a trans formation of the thrust of theological thinking since the first Ecumenical Council of 325 than is the rigorous theorization of the image after millennia of ritual uses and practice. It should be stressed that I do not mean there was no epistemology before Hiereia and no ontology after. Rather, both in the focus of theology and in the discussion of images (which at this moment turn out to be the same thing), there is a movement in interest and priority toward epistemological questions and interpretations over ontological ones. A good example of the combined discussion of ontology, epistemol ogy, and images in relation to thinking about the divine from a much earlier era is an excerpt from the philosopher An tisthenes (ca. 445-365 BCE), a student of Socrates, which survives—like so many of the texts discussed here—only as a citation in a number of church fathers (Clement, Protrepticus 6.71.2 and Stromata 5.14.108.4; Eusebius, Praeparatio evangelica 13.13.35, 15-16): "God is like no one (or nothing)" [an ontological statement], he said, "and on account of this no one is able to know him through a likeness" [an epistemo logical statement]. This is a rich text, which puns on the etymological link between "to be like" (eoikenai) and "like ness" or "image" (eikonos).79 The point is that the epistemo logical tradition offered by the likes of Antisthenes is taken up and reversed by iconophiles like John of Damascus, so that because God is man (through the Incarnation) and because we may know other men and women through their likenesses and images, so God is knowable through his likenesses: im ages are a means for knowing God and for opening a route to approach him. Before directly addressing these issues, it is worth noting in</page><page sequence="10">ICONOCLASM AS DISCOURSE: FROM ANTIQUITY TO BYZANTIUM 377 passing the outbreak of iconoclasm on the part of priests against Christian images that appears to have taken place in late sixth- or early seventh-century Armenia,80 as well as a series of defenses of images against either iconophobic doubters or outright iconoclasts during the sixth and seventh centuries.81 All these instances are complex, since the sources that report them are often later and always partisan, if not polemical, while the sociopolitical and intellectual contexts of such outbursts of iconoclasm are uncertain and at best hypothetically reconstructed. They include the justification of images and "material adornments in sanctuaries" that survives among the Miscellaneous Inquiries of Hypatius, bishop of Ephesus, in the 530s,82 the early seventh-century sermons delivered against the Jews in Cyprus by Leontius of Neapolis, whose fifth sermon includes a defense of images,83 and the Armenian defense of images associated with the figure of Vrt'anes K'ert'ogh.84 All these texts have been doubted— both as to date and as to authenticity—as one might expect in so polemicized an arena and with our survivals being often in secondary contexts and fragmentary forms.85 Beside the rise of an apologetics of the image after the sixth century (which can be paralleled in the West with both Serenus of Mar seilles's attack on images and Gregory the Great's riposte)86 and alongside the iconophobic positions that such apologies seem to respond to, we must place the significant commen tary on images embodied in three canons from the Quinisext Council of 692. These are not a wholesale theology of the image, nor are they a full turn to the epistemological themes implicit in theologizing the image, but they have been rightly singled out (and only rather recently) as key steps toward a fully theological articulation of images within church prac tice.87 The three canons—all effectively restrictive of what the council saw as excesses—forbade the placing of crosses on the floor (Canon 73), placed a premium on the representa tion of Christ as a man rather than as a symbol such as a lamb (Canon 82), and perhaps somewhat vaguely objected to any images that "corrupt the mind and excite base pleasures" (Canon 100).88 The Breaking of a Discourse It is within this discourse of image politics, often involving iconoclasm (particularly in Constantinople), that the act her alding the rise of Byzantine iconoclasm (agreed on by all our sources) took place. That act was, of course, the breaking of an image. In 726 or 730 (our two best sources disagree on the precise date)89 Leo III, Byzantine emperor from 717 to 741 and a superb general who had defeated the Arab assault on the city of Constantinople in 717, had the image of Christ above the Chalke Gate to the imperial palace removed (it has been supposed to resemble the iconography of the bust of Christ as seen in Figs. 3, 4, 10, 14) .9H Until about 1990, no one doubted the written evidence of our sources: history was realist and sought, after removing any rhetorical excess from highly polemical documents, to come to a judicious sifting of the nuggets of truth amid the dross. However, after 1990 a series of reviews of the evidence make it quite possible— perhaps even very likely—that the Chalke Christ is a fabrica tion of the late eighth or early ninth century,91 a phantasma goric prefiguration of an icon of Christ that really was set up by the iconophile Empress Irene in the wake of the Second Council of Nicaea in 78792 and was then removed by Em peror Leo V about the time of the second iconoclast council of 815.93 If this is true, then it offers the delicious irony that Irene's icon, replacing an earlier image of the cross,94 was itself an act of iconophile iconoclasm within the charged context of the image polemics of the last years of the eighth century. At any rate, the Chalke Christ was restored in a full-length standing version in mosaic after the Triumph of Orthodoxy (and the final restitution of icons) in 843.95 Our sources report rioting and image destruction at the purported outbreak of iconoclasm in the 720s or 730s, which is what one would expect from writings of a violently icono phile bias.96 They fail to report any other iconoclastic out burst during the rest of Leo's reign, or executions or perse cutions in relation to the two attested iconoclastic acts. Even more awkward for those who would portray Leo as a rabid iconoclast, there is no mention in his Ecloga or legal code of 741 of images at all—either penalties for making them or penalties for venerating them.97 What is important is how little iconoclasm we can in fact establish for the first decades of the period we call Iconoclastic; in fact, there is hardly any attested in the first ten years of Constantine V, until the iconoclast council of Hiereia in 754.98 What is interesting is lhat within the folklore of icono clasm, the Chalke Christ shortly became the key icon whose destruction would be forever associated with the inception of iconoclasm. In the mythology concocted within the eighth century, iconoclasm was made to stand or fall by an image. We might say that this is no more than the same discourse of images and iconoclasm that was a normal part of Byzantine politics in the period before iconoclasm. It is not especially iconoclastic. And yet the destruction of the Chalke Christ is not quite comparable to any iconoclastic strategy that pre ceded it. Leo had not just come to the throne. He was not attacking an image that was theologically controversial, as was the Sixth Council to a Monothelete or Patriarch Sergius to an Orthodox. On the contrary, Leo had made a completely unproblematic image into a controversial one. What Leo had done is not parallel to the to-and-fro iconoclasms of Philip picus and Anastasius, whose theological disagreements none theless involved an acceptance of the rules of the game of image discourse. It is much closer to the act of Abd al-Malik, who, when faced with the figurative sign for the transcenden tal absolute, the image of Christ as Rex Regnantium, had refused to play by the rules that allowed that sign to exist at all. Leo's act, as reported by the folklore, in destroying the Chalke Christ makes a similar gesture. It says that this dis course—the discourse of images for theology, of images as theology—is unacceptable. The mythical attack on the Chalke Christ is not an attack on images so much as an assault on the discourse of Byzantine society, a discourse that had been unproblematically accepted and that was a part of that society's self-definition. Small wonder, then, that it was so outrageous—or rather, if the Chalke icon is a late eighth century fabrication, that so outrageous an object for the break in discourse had to be invented in the folklore. Leo's iconoclasm lies not so much in image breaking as in the wider metaphoric sense that the word carries in English today. Leo was iconoclastic in the wholesale negation of the image discourse implicit in the destruction of the Chalke</page><page sequence="11">378 art bulletin September 2012 volume xciv number 3 Christ and of the self-image of Byzantine society that was in some way predicated on the acceptance of an image dis course for the sacred. It may be added that the folklore's focus on the image of Christ is a genuflection to the key ontological justification for the sacredness of Christian im ages, namely, the myth of the acheiropoieton, the image not made by human hands. Supremely, such images were mirac ulous icons of Christ—Veronica's cloth, the Mandylion or shroud in which the dead Christ had been wrapped, and so forth. I have not drawn attention to this theme because the acheiropoieton is an exceptional—indeed, unique—image, a kind of relic, while the attack on and the defense of icons in Byzantium turned ultimately on images that had been made by human hands." Whatever replaced the imagined icon of the Chalke Christ—a cross, a nonreligious image, or nothing at all—the result was the same: at a stroke, the entire discourse of figurative images as a means of enunciating or representing the holy was thrown into question. What Leo had done was to deny its validity. However, it was only after the act (what may itself, as we have seen, been a later invention) that the theology came—both the justification for the Tightness of the act (which is to say, the wrongness of images) and the attack on the wrongness of iconoclasm, which was also the defense of icons. In fact, on the level of texts, it was the mature statement in defense of images that came first, in the form of the three orations written by John of Damascus, a monk in Palestine, perhaps based at the Monastery of Mar Saba near Jerusalem, and hence living under the caliphate and never within Byzantine imperial jurisdiction.100 These have been dated as early as 726 (that is, as an immediate response to Leo's destruction of the Chalke Christ, depending on when one dates this, if it happened at all) or as late as the 750s, that is, before the iconoclast Council of Hiereia in 754.101 The three orations may be read as separate works (in which case there is a great deal of self-plagiarism on John's part) or as three versions of the same treatise for different occasions or purposes.10" For and Against Images: The Turn to Epistemology John of Damascus opens his defense in the first oration by confronting head-on an issue central to the whole Christian discourse on images and the history of the reluctance to give them full play, namely, the problem of idolatry. At 1.4-7 (repeated at 3.6-7 and partially at 2.8), he quotes a series of the Old Testament prohibitions on images and concludes "that He forbids the making of images because of idolatry and that it is impossible to make an image of the immea surable, uncirumscribed, invisible God." Then he turns to the Incarnation as the special case that justifies images: "When He who is bodiless and without form ... is found in a body of flesh, then you may draw his image and show it to anyone willing to gaze upon it" (1.8; 3.8). This leads directly to the question of worship: "Use every kind of drawing, word, or color. Fear not; have no anxiety; discern between the different kinds of worship. . . . For adora tion [ T) Tfjs XaTpeias TTpooKWTiais ] is one thing, and that which is offered in order to honor [r| 6K Ti|ifjs Ttpocrayo^evTi ] some thing of great excellence is another" (1.8). This leads to a long and careful distinction between image and prototype (1.9-13), which is followed by the distinction within worship between that which is appropriate for God alone (latreia, or adoration, 1.14) and that which is appropriate for images (proskynesis, honor or veneration, 1.15-16).103 In a brilliant and passionate summary, which is much quoted and may be said to encapsulate the later theology of the icon, John wrote, "I do not worship [ouproskynd\ matter; I worship the Creator of matter who became matter for my sake, who accepted to dwell in matter, who worked out my salvation through matter. Never will I cease adoring the matter, which wrought my salvation!." (1.16; 2.14)104 The line of argu ment is admirably clear, and it is developed explicidy in the second half of the third oration (introduced at 3.11-15), where John concentrates first on what an image is (3.16-26) and then on the nature of veneration (3.27-42). The emphasis on what images are refutes the charge of idolatry, but the shift to the use of images in the process of approaching and honoring the Godhead is key. The image is "a likeness, a paradigm, an ex pression of something, showing in itself what is depicted in the image" (3.16), and this means that "images reveal and make perceptible those things which are hidden" (3.17). The image "was devised that man might advance in knowledge, and that secret things might be revealed and made perceptible" (3.17). Effectively, although he opens on a question of the ontology of the image, John shifts the parameters of the argument to an epistemological claim about how images work within the divine economy to take man toward God.10'' It is important to note that Christology—that is, the precise definition of what the Incarnation means in terms of Jesus being both man and God—is the crucial mechanism for John's argument.""' Because Christ was fully man, then he must be capable of representation, as any other man may be. Because Christ can be represented in images, the images that portray him give access to the Godhead within. This is hardly unrelated, of course, to the special focus of the iconoclastic attack on the image of Christ (whether actually or in later folklore).10' In theological terms, the shift to Christology was a clever move not only because of its centrality to John's Incarnational defense of the icon but also because Christol ogy had been the traditional and key language of theological argument since the First Ecumenical Council's pronounce ments in 325. That is, the icon's validity is dependent on its justification through Christological ontology, but its purpose and function within the divine economy were epistemologi cal—-a means to know and approach the hidden God, where the worship given to the image is transferred to the prototype (see 1.21 and 1.36, wherejohn quotes Saint Basil directly).108 The icon is ontologically validated through its Incarnational participation in Christ's two natures, and it is through its quality as matter—fully accessible to humanity—that its ac cess to Christ's divine nature is made possible. The Christol ogy both justifies the icon on ontological grounds as accept able and gives it its epistemological position as conduit by which one may know God. It is frequently asserted that iconoclasm was about idola try.109 And it is certainly true that iconoclasts used polemical accusations of idolatry against iconophiles, just as iconophiles accused iconoclasts of being Arian heretics.110 But this kind of heresiological mudslinging is what we would expect in the world of Byzantine theological polemics. The best evidence for the fundamental shift (effected by John of Damascus)</page><page sequence="12">ICONOCLASM AS DISCOURSE: FROM ANTIQUITY TO BYZANTIUM 379 from issues of idolatry to issues of Christology is that in the horos or definition of its decisions, pronounced by the iconoclast Council of Hiereia in 754,111 relatively little attention is given to the icon as idol, although idolatry is mentioned explicitly in relation to the Devil's misleading of Christians into worshiping the creation rather than the Creator, especially at 221D.112 Rather, the horos of the council, as it survives in the sixth session of the acta of the Seventh Ecumenical Council, whose primary purpose was to refute it, is concerned with an attack on images couched in the Christological discourse introduced by John. After affirming its communion with the six earlier Ecumenical Councils and their long list of anathemas, the horos of Hiereia proclaims: "Having looked into these matters with great diligence and deliberation under the inspiration of the all-holy Spirit, we have found also that the unlawful art of painters [Tfjv a0ep.iTov tSv £&lt;j)ypd&lt;t&gt;wv TexvTjv] constitutes a blasphemy. . . ." (240C). Blasphemy and the issue of idolatry are construed not ontologically—as in "an image is an idol"—but epistemologically, as an inappropriate act of cultivation, a mistaking of creation for the Creator. This leads to the "error of those who make and those who pay respect" to icons (245D), an argument that has been con nected with the Peuseis, or Inquiries of Emperor Constan tine V, which themselves survive only in very fragmentary form within the refutation conducted by the ninth-century Patriarch Nicephorus.113 The argument of the horos of Hiereia then turns, with some acuity and theological brilliance, to the icon of Christ (252A). That is, it confronts both the Christological basis of John of Damascus's defense of images and (implic itly) the specific icon of the Chalke Christ, which at least later tradition identified with the first act of image break ing.114 Christ, the horos tells us, is both man and God. Thus, in "describing created flesh," the painter has either "circumscribed the uncircumscribable character of the God head [&lt;jt&gt;|nTepieypai|je ... to dtrepiypa^ov rfjs 0e6rriTOs]" or he has "confused that unconfused union [ auvexee tt|v aatiyxuTov evwaiv], falling into the iniquity of confusion."115 These two errors—circumscription and confusion—are described as "blas phemous" against the Godhead, again focusing not on the icon as an ontological problem, an idol that is the site of a presence that is not God, but on the icon's appropriateness as a means for approaching or knowing God. Interestingly, those who venerate icons are guilty of the same error as those who make them. An imagined iconophile riposte (256AB) that "It is the icon of the flesh alone that we have seen and touched. . .." is dismissed as equally heretical, since it represents a splitting of the two natures of Christ (human and divine), which is "impious and an inven tion of the Nestorian misfortune." One might object that the iconoclasts have hardly offered the best theological case that an iconophile could make for icons,111' but certainly, it has the effect of opening a theological double bind for the adherents of icons. Either they think "that the divinity is circumscribable and confused with the flesh" (a heresy and a blasphemy) or they think "that the body of Christ was without divinity and divided," and hence they worship only the image of the flesh (also a heresy and a blasphemy; 260AB). Therefore, whatever an icon may be, it is a product of heresy. The only true image is the Eucharist (261E-264C), for it alone has been sanctified by a prayer in the Apostolic tradition."' There is no consecrating prayer for an icon (268C and 269D). The rejection of the icon of Christ then allows the rejection of images of the Virgin and the prophets, apostles, and martyrs (272B, 272D), but on the relatively weak grounds that since the icon of Christ "has been abol ished, there is no need for" the others (272D). This position would in principle call for much more argument than we are given, especially because all these other figures are "not of two natures, divine and human" (272B, 272D). It is possible such argument was given in the acts of the Council of Hiereia (which do not survive) and even in a segment of the horos not preserved.118 But it is also of minimal importance. For all sides agreed that the epistemological case for the image as acceptable representation lay in the icon of Christ: Could it be a correct means for access to the divine, or, by being a false means, was it effectively a barrier to such access?119 That Christological case, although couched in the language devel oped over centuries by the church to define the ontology of' the Second Person of the Trinity, which is to say the nature of the Incarnation and of the process of salvation that depends on the Word becoming flesh in the Christian dispensation, is now used epistemologically to determine whether God may be approached through images. Following these arguments (all too baldly put, perhaps, which is in part the result of their being in the form of a final conciliar definition but may in part be the effect of the cuts and selections made by the iconophile council of Nicaea on what survives of the declarations of the iconoclast council of Hiereia, not only in the horos itself but also in relation to the loss of the rest of the documentary materials presented at Hiereia), the council proceeded to an examination of biblical and patristic testimonia in favor of its position and then to a. series of anathemas, some related to earlier condemnations pronounced by previous ecumenical councils and many re lated to the specific case of images. These latter include anathemas on anyone who attempted to make or venerate an icon or set one up in a church, a private home, or in hiding (328C). This is interesting both for the repeated conflation of making and worshiping images as one sin and for the range of spaces in which icons abound and need to be resisted. Further anathemas are directed at anyone who turned to understand God (katanoesai) "through material colors" (336E), who tried to "circumscribe with material col ors in icons, in an anthropomorphic way, the uncircumscrib able essence" (337D), who tried to "paint in an icon the undivided hypostatic union of the nature of God the Word along with that of the flesh" and thus confuse the two natures (340C), or who thought of the Incarnate God as "mere flesh and consequently, endeavors to describe it in an icon" (341 A), and so on. We might be tempted to agree with the iconophile refuters of Hiereia in commenting on these anathemas that "repeating in cycles the same kinds of things, they make so many pronouncements that what they chatter will be almost beyond numbering" (341D). Yet the range of anathemas concerns not whether an icon per se is an idol or bad in its own right but the range of (in the view of the iconoclasts) mistaken positions about what God is and how he may be approached, which the use of icons may entail— and those positions are many and subtle.</page><page sequence="13">380 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 3 14 Hexagonal censer with figural busts, front with a medallion showing Christ holding a book, Peter holding a cross to the right and Paul to the left, probably Constantinople, first decade of the 7th century, found in Cyprus, silver, 2¥s X 4!4 in.

The council says: At the same time we ordain that no one in charge of a church or pious institution shall venture, under pretext of destroying the error in regard to images, to lay his hands on the holy vessels in order to have them altered, because they are adorned with figures. The same is provided in regard to the vestments of churches, cloths, and all that is dedicated to divine service. However, should anyone, strengthened by God, wish to have such church vessels and vestments altered, he must do this only with the assent of the holy Ecumenical patriarch and at the bidding of our pious Emperors. So also no prince or secular official shall rob the churches, as some have done in former times, under the pretext of destroying images. (329E-332E)120 This injunction, related to figurally decorated liturgical ves sels and fitments (such as seen in a range of objects from pre-Iconoclast times, Figs. 14-20), does not anathematize existing images or icons in liturgical use, nor does it allow anyone, including priests and other officials, any kind of free rein on iconoclasm (meaning the destruction of such im ages), in part to protect church property,121 although alter ations may be made with the consent of higher authority. Certainly, it conceives of churches operating with icons in the key utensils of divine service even under the dispensation of the iconoclast Council of Hiereia. The Second Council of Nicaea finds such a conclusion a piece of absurd contradic tion: "While they defame the holy Church of God and decree she is wrong in accepting iconographic representations . . . now as if forgetting their own wicked decision, they 15 Back view of Fig. 14, showing a medallion of the Virgin, Saint John the Evangelist to the right and Saint James to the left. The British Museum, London, 1899.04925.3 (artwork in the public domain; photograph © The Trustees of the British Museum) reckon that these should stay" (332C). But this is polemic. The passage seems to give substantial support to the view that the iconoclast position in 754 is about not icons per se but their inappropriateness epistemologically for approaching God. What is needed, according to Hiereia, is not wholesale destruction but the end of new production. As far as icons are concerned, Hiereia was about making and not breaking images. In terms of liturgy, what Hiereia called for was implicitly a gradual reform that would translate the church from an institution dependent on icons to one where, rather than use "the forms [ideas] of the saints in inani mate and speechless icons made of material colors [ev e'lKoaiv ou)jiixols Kai avau8ois e£ uXlkwv xPWf-^Twv], which bring no benefit," the worshiper should "paint in himself their [the saints'] virtues as living icons [en4&gt;iJX0US e'lKOvas], consequently to incite in himself the zeal to become like them" (345CD). The true icon is not a painted image but the virtues of the saints painted in oneself, as well as the Eucharist that the worshiper eats (which is described as "the icon of his body, the giver of life [ r| eiKWV toO Cwottoiou aai(iaTOs]," 264A).122 The theoretics of the first Iconoclastic era, then, both in the defense of images mounted by John of Damascus and in the assault on images conducted by the Seventh Council of 754, constitutes a move away from ontological issues, both in theology and in the definition of holy images (as potential idols) toward epistemological concerns about how images may or may not be appropriate as a means for accessing the hidden God. The image is ontologically justified by means of the Incarnation, but its purpose or function-—the reason it matters at all—is epistemological, to direct the worshiper toward the divine, to help the pious know the divine, and to be an appropriate channel for veneration of the divine.

A shift in theological policy, blamed on Irene (at any rate, by the iconoclast synod of 815), led in 786-87 to the calling of the Second Council of Nicaea, which has come subsequently to be regarded as an Ecumenical Council.125 It has been argued—correctly, I think, and strik ingly—that Nicaea II sought to lower the stakes and the temperature of the argument about images by avoiding the clamorous levels of Christological debate,124 and effectively aimed to circumvent disputed questions with an appeal to tradition and a rejection of Hiereia on the procedural grounds that it failed to do its job properly and misrepre sented most of its citations by taking them out of their literary or historical context.125 The horos or definition of Nicaea II makes two fundamental claims in relation to icons.126 First, it ordains, with all exactitude and diligence that, like the image of the revered and life-giving Cross, so too sacred and holy icons, whether of paint, of mosaic or other suitable materials, should be offered and dedicated to the holy churches of God, on sacred vessels and vestments, on walls and on wooden panels, at home and in the streets, whether of the image of our Lord and God and Savior Jesus Christ or of our immaculate Lady the Mother of God or of the blessed angels and all saints and holy men.12' The aim here is clearly to enumerate the range of materials in which icons may be made and on which they may appear, as well as the spaces where they may be erected and the variety of holy beings who may be accorded them. All this is clearly in response to the limitations, restrictions, and prohi bitions imposed by Hiereia. At some issue has been the question of whether the horos of Nicaea II ordains that icons may be dedicated in addition to the cross or ought to be set up!128 At least as significant is the follow-up statement in the horos of the Nicene Council of 787: For the more often they [the saints] are seen through pictorial representations [ eiKOVLKfjs waTUTTwaews ], the</page><page sequence="15">382 art bulletin September 2012 volume xciv number 3 17 Book cover showing the apostle Paul in an arch holding a book, with a surrounding frame of grapevines and peacocks in the upper corners, 6th century, found near Antioch, silver, 10% X 8V2 in.

Most striking about this passage, clearly a direct riposte to the claim of Hiereia that the true icon is the virtue of the saint in the worshiper's heart, is the complete avoidance of onto logical argument about what an icon is or even of Chris tology. Instead, following the affirmation of the range of icons permitted and the spaces in which they are allowed, it gives a firm statement of the nature and variety of worship that may be directed to and through them. In the end, the whole rationale of Nicaea's argument rests on its implicit reference to Saint Basil's dictum about the honor being transferred to the prototype, which John of Damas cus had explicitly cited. The iconophile dominance lasted only until the ascent to the throne of Leo V (813-20), who in 815 caused the abdi cation of the iconophile Patriarch Nicephorus and the calling of a second iconoclast council, at St. Sophia.129 The second Iconoclastic era seems to have been a very different phenom enon from the first. While the Council of 815 ratified and therefore appeared to accept all the arguments of the Hiereia Council of 754, its concerns seem to have been very differ ent.130 It accepted that images are not idols, and it essentially abandoned the heavy-duty Christological arguments of Hiereia. Does this mean that the bishops of 815 thought Hiereia's Christology had effectively been defeated by John of Damascus and the arguments of 787? In short, iconoclasm was now wholly a debate about appropriate epistemology—about how the holy is to be known, wor shiped, and approached. The real criticism of the Seventh Ecumenical Council offered in 815 is that Nicaea "con founded worship [ tt|v XaTpevTiKT|v r||j.wv irpoaKwriaiv] by ar bitrarily affirming that what is fit for God should be offered to the inanimate matter [ d^iJXWL uXtil] of icons."131 The horos of St. Sophia ostracized "from the Catholic Church the unwarranted manufacture of spurious icons," which are "unfit for veneration and useless."132 It annulled Nicaea II on the grounds that it "bestowed exaggerated honor to painting [chromasi, literally, "to colors"], namely, the lighting of candles and lamps and the offering of incense, these marks of veneration being those reserved for the worship of God [latreia]."133 It explicitly pro nounced that "we refrain from calling them [icons] idols since there is a distinction between different kinds of evil."134 Here, "iconoclasm" did not mean a rejection of icons, or their breaking, or even necessarily their removal. The letter of the iconoclast emperors Michael II and Theophilus to Louis the Pious of 824, which admittedly is a document targeted to a Carolingian readership and may be highly se lective and careful about what it chooses to argue, accepts the use of icons for didactic purposes but removes them from positions near the ground to places high up, so as to prevent worship.1 !:&gt; What mattered about worship was proximity, a sense of mediation with the spiritual through the material. But this was unacceptable as far as icons are concerned; the letter objects to the veneration of images, to their use in place of the altar or cross, and to a series of practices including the mixing of paint scraped off images with the Eucharistic bread and wine and the use of images as baptismal godfathers.136 The icon itself is the least controversial element here. The second Iconoclastic era is not about images at all but about what counts as abuse in worship. It should be added that the ninth century is a time that has been seen as generative of a liturgical revolution.15' As part of his reform of the monasteries, Theodore of Studion adopted the new monastic liturgy finalized in Mar Saba in Palestine a little less than a century earlier.138 This liturgy, infused with poetic hymnography, was more mystical. When art resurged in the later part of the century, one main difference with the pre-Iconoclastic era was its new liturgical character.

Riffing on the key text of Saint Basil by which the iconophiles from John of Damascus to the horos of the Second Council of Nicaea have justified images, one of the greatest modern experts on iconoclasm has defined the demolition of images thus: "The dishonor paid to the image . . . does not simply pass to its prototype, but actually damages the prototype itself."140 This formulation is right for the long process of iconoclastic action, what I have called a discourse of icono clasm, reaching back from Greek antiquity (wonderfully at tested in the Delphic inscription about the condemnation of the Phocian generals Onomarchus and Philomelus) via dam natio memoriae in the Roman world to the early eighth century CE in Constantinople when Emperor Philippicus demolished the image of the Sixth Ecumenical Council and subsequently had his own images destroyed by his successor, Anastasius. On this model, some element of real presence inhered in the image—not fully theorized, to be sure, but potent enough to be worthy of attack through iconoclasm. The key point is that</page><page sequence="17">384 art bulletin September 2012 volume xciv number 3 20 Textile icon showing the Virgin and Child between angels and, in the upper section, Christ enthroned between angels, with a border including the twelve apostles, probably 6th century, wool, 70'/x X 4314 in. (178 X 110 cm). The Cleveland Museum of Art, Leonard C. Hanna, Jr., Fund, 67.144 (artwork in the public domain; photograph © The Cleveland Museum of Art) when Leo III destroyed the icon of the Chalke Christ (whether in reality or in later legend), this discourse had irreparably changed. No one—iconoclast or iconophile— wished to dishonor, let alone to damage, the prototype, that is, Christ himself.141 The issue had moved from a direct tie to prototypes, and therefore the potential for a direct attack on prototypes through their images, to whether the image itself, as representation, was an appropriate means of making the prototype present. It was formulated by asking whether the icon was an appropriate means for knowing, honoring, and accessing the hidden God through his Incarnate Son, the Trinity through its Second Person. Or, to put it another way: Was the image's existence in its own right an act of dishonor to the prototype (because the icon falsely represented it), or was it a locus of real presence and therefore the correct recipient of veneration? In other words, the shift in the ancient discourse of iconoclasm to the image of Christ—which is also the shift, engineered by</page><page sequence="18">ICONOCLASM AS DISCOURSE: FROM ANTIQUITY TO BYZANTIUM 3g5 the arguments of John of Damascus and the iconoclasts at the Council of Hiereia, to Christology as the philosophical lan guage with which to think about images—is a move to con sider the image entirely as representation. This is a transforma tive moment in the discourse of images, signaling the semiotic liberating of the image from an unarticulated and generally assumed ontological tie to its referent to place the image instead in an epistemological relation to its referent (as either a true or a false way of knowing God). That epistemology was for iconophiles always grounded ontologi cally in the Incarnational logic that God had become matter, meaning that matter could lead back to God. By the second Iconoclastic era, all discussion of idolatry and even Christol ogy had been superseded by questions of ritual—how close icons might be to viewers, whether offerings should be made to them at all, and, if so, of what sort. From the specific assault either on the prototype or even on the image itself, the issue had become the status of the icon in its own right as a means of mediation in the wider sacred economy. The end result, after the final defeat of iconoclasm in 843, was that John of Damascus's Incarnational theory of images, refined by Nice phorus and Theodore of Studion in the early ninth century, enabled a fully thought-through theoretics of the image in which its materiality, sanctified by God having become matter in the person of Jesus, allowed epistemological access through ritual to the holy.142 The conceptualization of real presence in images had never been fully articulated or justi fied before. To return to the key text from Saint Basil on which the iconophile case in the end came to rest, when it was first articulated, as an illustration within a sermon on the Holy Spirit,143 it offered a formulation of something that was pa tently accepted in the culture but not necessarily theorized or overtly stated. Basil represented the relations of image and prototype in the positive as honor transferred from one to the other, but clearly the discourse of iconoclasm partici pated in the same assumptions—the prototype being dam aged through damaging the image. What Byzantine icono clasm did, in the probable myth of the removal of the Chalke Christ, in the theological works of Constantine V (his Peuseis), and in the pronouncements of Hiereia, was to break the link of image and prototype and to announce that far from dam aging the prototype, the destruction of its false and blasphe mous images was itself a form of honor. The defense of images, arguing that their very materiality was the guarantee of their being an appropriate way of honoring and accessing the divine in the aftermath of the Incarnation, reaffirmed, justified, and grounded real presence and the logic by which it operated as never before in the ancient Greek or Roman worlds. That defense set up the space that would be chal lenged by the iconoclasts of the Reformation—but it must not be supposed that theirs was precisely the same target as that of the Byzantine iconoclasts. For no Byzantine wanted to damage Christ, the Virgin, or the saints, whereas many in the Protestant north were opposed to anything except the imma terial God and his Scriptural witness. In discursive terms, the logic of Byzantine iconoclasm re plays that of the numismatic "wars" of 'Abd al-Malik and Justinian II at the end of the seventh century, but on a philosophical level of theoretical argument rather than in purely visual terms. Justinian's move to place the icon of Christ on the coinage is analogous to John of Damascus ratcheting up the stakes of the icon by making its validity depend on the Incarnation and on a full Christological ar gument. 'Abd al-Malik's abandonment of figural images on the coinage altogether is analogous to the image denial of iconoclasm (justified Christologically at Hiereia). We may say that the structure of the two arguments in terms of image making, raising the stakes, and image denial are utterly par allel, although in the earlier case of the coinage we have only images themselves to do the arguing, while in the later case of Byzantine iconoclasm we have almost no images at all but a veritable flood of textual polemic and theology. The first "image war" (in numismatics) is between cultures and be tween rival empires—one in which effectively a shared late antique heritage of portraiture and coinage came to be dis avowed, with the Muslims going for aniconism while the Christians went for the affirmation of the image of Christ. The second "image war"—Byzantine iconoclasm itself—is in ternal to Eastern Christianity, although it is interesting that the most potent advocate of the strongest Incarnational rais ing of the stakes was a monk writing from within the caliph ate. But the two sets of arguments over images, in the coinage and in polemical theology, coming so close together and being so alike in structure, point to a period when the image as object and as object-to-think-with was as powerful a discur sive and polemical weapon as it would ever be in the Western tradition. There is no doubt that the variety of positions offered during Byzantine iconoclasm constitutes one of the deepest conceptual contributions to the problem of the image as representation ever conducted.144 The difficulty for us is that the formulation of these discussions, in highly theological terms that, to secularly educated moderns, seem abstruse at best and repugnant to many, has prevented Byzantium's developed theoretical interrogation of the image from being appreciated by those with an interest in the issue in other areas of the history of art. To grasp the depth and effect of the theoretics of the icon in the period of iconoclasm, let us start again from the longue duree and isolate three moments in European culture when the image takes on significant po tency as the object of reflection in the intellectual environ ment. The rise of naturalism in Greek art during the fifth century BCE in visual terms marks the birth of representation in the West. That is, the archaic image as double (both sign for its referent and container of that referent), figuring presence in absence and presence as absence,145 was supplemented by the naturalistic image, which is effectively a commentary on the life it represents—no longer usually the full, real pres ence of its referent but instead a representation of what that referent is and the world in which he or she operates.146 This shift, "the Greek Revolution," long recognized and essential to the rise of naturalism, is in part a move from the ontology of the object as potential container of its referent, as a potentially active player in a divine or magic sense within the real world, to the epistemology of the image as commenting on the real world. It includes the fascinating effect of images commenting on the workings of images—and especially on the making, stealing, and cultivation of cult images, which are</page><page sequence="19">386 art bulletin September 2012 volume xciv number 3 usually stylized as archaic by contrast with the Classical style of the representation of people. This fundamental development of ancient Greek art in the move to mimesis, and the long continuity of archaic-type nonnaturalisdc images (both ani conic and nonmimetic) alongside naturalism made for a deep play of visual theology and commentarial exegesis en tirely performed through images themselves.147 This is largely a world of experience not subjected to theorization, but it is significant that the new status of the image under the regime of naturalism—both aesthetically and conceptually— gave rise to Plato's worries about mimesis.148 By the Hellenis tic and Roman periods, in the creative free play of literary epigram, epideictic rhetoric, and fictional prose—especially in that class of texts we call ekphrastic—these questions were subject to a remarkable degree of implicit (though playful and fictionalizing) interpretation, but hardly to systematic philosophizing.149 Since the image itself was not fully theo rized, it was adapted to specifically Stoic epistemologies about how one might know the world through the ways images impact on the senses and on the imagination.150 If we fast forward to the Reformation, we find the third great moment when the image appeared as a central issue, bringing with it the trauma of Catholic idolatry for Protestant thinkers and solidifying as the bedrock of traditional religion for Catholics, in forms justified and extended after the Coun ter-Reformation. Either the image was, for Protestants, a wholly degenerate and idolatrous misconception of how to approach God,1''1 or it was, for Roman Catholics, a key tra ditional and long-sanctioned means for accessing the di vine.152 One of the interesting side effects of the Protestant attack on the real presence of Christian images was the triumph of text over image in the German (Protestant) tra dition of writing about art, which ultimately became the discipline of art history.153 Again, for all the fundamental concerns about idolatry, the real issue, as it was in Classical Greece and in Byzantium, is epistemological—that is, a ques tion of how to access the real (as seen in sacred terms) through its representations, and whether one can appropri ately do so through images. Between these two great moments in the culture of the image in the West stand the developments of Byzantine icon oclasm in relation to the theoretics of the making and the worshiping of icons. The Iconoclastic period brought the final conceptual theorization of the image in the Greco Roman tradition (and in the Greek philosophical terminol ogy inherited from Plato) cast in the then dominant philo sophical structures of Byzantine theology and especially Christology. Above all, it generated the developed and theo rized version of the shift from ontology to epistemology already implicit in naturalism's ability to comment on how our world works and to ask what our images are. But, notably in the works of John of Damascus, composed in the 730s or 740s, it brilliantly used epistemology (that is, the place of the image within the divine economy as a means for knowing God and opening a route of access to him) to justify, indeed, to establish theoretically on sound theological grounds, the image's ontology as icon—as container, through an identity of person with the referent represented, of a divine presence, while still being no more than matter, the matter sanctified by the Incarnation. This theory, systematically tested by the iconoclasts at the Council of Hiereia in 754 CE and ultimately upheld in the later resistance to Hiereia, was to serve as the basis for a medieval view of the image as fully equal with Scripture and any other articulation of the holy and as a dominant constituent of the sacred economy of both the Byzantine and the Western Middle Ages. And precisely this high standing and this understanding of the image would attract the opprobrium of northern Europe's iconoclasts in the sixteenth century.134 I have attempted to reposition Byzantine iconoclasm into a longue duree analysis as a discursive strategy, both better to understand its historical nexus of causation (which is in my view very deep and long: effectively no less than a considered revision of the entire Classical tradition's relations with im ages) and to show the special importance of what the difficult arguments of eighth- and ninth-century theologians were actually doing in relation to the longer history of how images have been conceived in the West. Let me end by returning to the question of historical explanation. Our understanding of iconoclasm suffers less from a crisis of overexplanation than from an impasse in our assumptions about what history should be. The range of evidence is fissile, fragmentary, highly rhetorical, whether as apology or polemic. For those wedded to a realist view of the task of history, and that includes most of those who have devoted attention to the topic, finding the fire for which the various wisps of smoke must be evidence has been the prin cipal aim. Yet after an extraordinary amount of scholarship, we remain pretty unclear about what, if anything, happened around the breaking of images in the Iconoclastic era and about what its causes (whether proximate or remote) actually were. However, if one explores the evidence we have as discourse, that is, as the visual and literary production of a society's self-reflections about how it related to itself and its God in a time of crisis in the face of the threat of Islam and the loss of great swaths of territory in the east and south,155 at a time when the great fissure within Byzantine culture be tween antiquity and the Middle Ages took place,151' then the issues are less about what really may or may not have taken place (which we will never know) than about how perceived problems and changes were articulated, invented, and my thologized. In this sense, it matters little whether or not there really was a Chalke Christ for Leo III to destroy, but it matters much that such an image—and specifically the image of Christ (as opposed to the Virgin and Child or a saint) should have been invented or deemed necessary for the job of having been destroyed. That is, for the modern historian, what iconoclasm provokes—and part of its perennial inter est—is an examination of what we think we are doing in writing history at all.

Robin Cormack supervised my master's thesis at the Courtauld Institute on Byzantine iconoclasm in 1985-86, and I should like to dedicate this piece to him, as a small token of the many things I have learned from him both as a student and later as a colleague. It has been a signal aspect of my career as a Classicist to have spent much time with Byzantinists. That part of my doctoral work spent in Rome was in the close company of Charles Barber, companion on many a trip and interlocutor in many a conversation; and that part spent at the Warburg Institute was enlivened by the presence of Liz James and Ruth Webb. I have been fortunate to have worked as a teacher and researcher at the Courtauld with Robin Cormack and with John Lowden, in Chicago with Rob Nelson and Walter Kaegi, in Corpus Christi College with James Howard Johnston and Mark Whittow: I am grateful to all of them for conversations and stimulation in this field over a long period. This particular paper origi nates as a response to a day on Iconoclasms in Corpus organized by Neil McLynn and me, with Leslie Brubaker, Barry Flood, and John Haldon, sponsored generously by Paul Pheby.

So, for instance, Brown, "A Dark-Age Cri sis," 5, emphasizes the holy—"The Iconoclast Controversy was a de bate on the position of the holy in Byzantine society"—but turns out to imply centrifugal tendencies, local and individual attachments, and the loyalty of cities (18-24); and Patrick Henry, "What Was the Icono clastic Controversy About?" Church History 45 (1976): 16-31, suggests the debate was about "the meaning of the incarnation for history, about the definition and interpretation of Christian worship, and about conflicting claims to the title of the city of God" (21).

One might divide historical interpretations of Byzantine iconoclasm between those that take a broad approach to its causes over a long period and those focused rather more narrowly on events in the sev enth and eighth centuries.

For the second group, see Leslie Brubaker, "Icons before Icono clasm?"

For an overview, see Robin Cormack, "Art and Iconoclasm," in The Oxford Handbook of Byzantine Studies, ed. Eliza beth Jeffreys, John Haldon, and Cormack (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 751-57, esp. 753-54. 9. Kitzinger, "The Cult of Images," 128-29; and Andre Grabar, L'icono clasme byzantine: Dossier archeologique (Paris: Flammarion, 1957), 77-91, both argue for a date after about 550 CE for the rise of the cult of icons. Brown, "A Dark-Age Crisis," 10-11, goes for the "sixth and sev enth centuries"; Averil Cameron, "Images of Authority: Elites and Icons in Late Sixth-Century Byzantium," Past and Present 84 (1979): 3-35, emphasizes the late sixth century (cf.

Noble, Images, Iconoclasm and the Carolin ians (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009), 31, claims, "A consensus so broad that it requires no elaboration holds that icons spread tremendously in the sixth and seventh centuries"— but one might worry about consensus in any academic matter, since it often speaks of what appeals to collective contemporary ideology within the academy rather than historical actuality. 10. See Brubaker, "Icons before Iconoclasm?" 1216-17, for the rise of the holy portrait after 600. 11. Ibid., 1253: "There is little evidence for a 'cult of sacred images' in pre-Iconoclast Byzantium. The textual and the material evidence agrees that sacred portraits existed, but there is little indication that these images received special veneration in any consistent fashion be fore the late seventh century. . . and see Brubaker and Haldon, By zantium in the Iconoclastic Era, 62-63, for about 680.

Leslie Brubaker (Aldershot, U.K.: Ashgate, 1998), 85-99. 12. Brubaker, "Icons before Iconoclasm?" 1254: "What we might legiti mately call a cult of images did not lead to Iconoclasm; it was gener ated by the discourse of the debate about Iconoclasm itself." 13. For an acute study of iconophile florilegia in the context of the an thological tradition of Byzantine Orthodoxy, see Alexander Alexakis, Codex Parisinus Graecus 1115 and Its Archetype (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, 1996), esp. 1-42 on florilegia in general, and 92 233 on varieties of iconophile anthologies, including those in John of Damascus and the Second Council of Nicaea. 14. This did not prevent parties from using the accusation of selective quotation against their opponents. As the Seventh Ecumenical Coun cil of Nicaea nicely pronounced in 787: "A characteristic of heretics is to present statements in fragmented form"; in Giovan-Domenico Mansi, Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, 53 vols.

Because this essay focuses on issues of representation and presence, it cannot venture into the wider thematics of violence, fanaticism, and so forth, which have come to dominate the more recent literature on iconoclasm generally, and especially that of the modern era.

My thanks to Richard Neer for alerting me to this literature. 39. The details are complicated. Philomelus orchestrated the robbery of the sanctuary in order to pay the mercenaries who were to fight on behalf of the Phocians against the forces of the Amphictyonic League, led latterly by Philip of Macedon. The outcome of the battles was ulti mately comprehensive defeat for the Phocians and their allies, as well as the deaths of the Phocian generals. The Delphic act of iconoclasm, a replay of the shameful treatment of the corpses of Onomarchus and Philomelus, was both an act of vengeance against their depredations of the sanctuary and a political gesture of consonance with Philip, the new de facto master of Greece. For discussion, see Pierre Ellinger, La legende nationale phocidienne, Bulletin de Correspondance Hellenique, suppl. 27 (Athens: Ecole Frangaise d'Athenes; Paris: Diffusion de Boc card, 1993), 326-32. 40.

Levine and Zeev Weiss (Portsmouth, R.I.: Journal of Roman Archaeology, 2000), 183-94; and Annabel Wharton, "Erasure: Eliminating the Space of Late Antique Judaism," in ibid., 195-214. For the intriguing suggestion that attitudes to image worship in Rab binic Judaism ventriloquize those in the hegemonic Christian culture, to the extent of tracing a rising trajectory in the cult of images toward the Iconoclastic period, see Rachel Neis, "Embracing Icons: The Face of Jacob on the Throne of God," Images 1 (2007): 36-54, esp. 47-54. 42. This is effectively a Protestant idealization, which saw early Christian ity as a pure and aniconic religion, close to an ideally aniconic Juda ism, later to be corrupted by various forms of idolatrous and paganiz ing accretions (to be identified with what became Roman Catholi cism). Of course, the real issue here is an internal Protestant-Catholic argument about German culture projected back onto its Christian ancestry. For an acute discussion of the inevitable Protestant and Catholic apologetics in relation to the study of the early church, see Jonathan Z. Smith, Drudgery Divine: On the Comparison of Early Christi anities and the Religions of Late Antiquity (Chicago: University of Chi cago Press, 1990); and for the art history of this period, see Jas Eis ner, "Archaeologies and Agendas: Jewish and Early Christian Art in Late Antiquity," Journal of Roman Studies 83 (2003): 114-28. 43. See especially Ernst von Dobschutz, Christusbilder: Untersuchungen zur christlichen Legende (Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs, 1899), chap. 2; Hugo Koch, Die altchristliche Bilderfrage nach den literarischen Quellen (Gottin gen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1917); W. Elliger, Die Stellung der alten Christen zu den Bildern in den ersten vier JahrhuncLerten (nach den Angaben der zeitgenossischen kirchlichen Schriftsteller) (Leipzig: Dieterich, 1930); idem, Zur Entstehung und fruhen Entwicklung der altchristlichen Bildkunst (Leipzig: Dieterich, 1934); and Ernest Bevan, Holy Images: An Inquiry into Idolatry and Image-Worship in Ancient Paganism and in Christi anity (London: Allen and Unwin, 1940). This position, established as a Protestant ideal on the basis of a (selective) series of texts, was ac cepted by a generation of art historians such as Kitzinger, "The Cult of Images," 88-89; and Theodore Klauser in a series of articles under the general title "Studien zur Entstehungsgeschichte der christlichen Kunst," published in the 1950s and 1960s in vols. 1-10 of the Jahrbuch fur Antike und Christentum. See the discussion by Helmut Feld, De Iko noklasmus des Westens (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1990), 2-6; and Paul Corby Finney, The Invisible God: The Earliest Christians on Art (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994), 7-10. 44.

Arguably, the pattern of their attitudes parallels those of the rabbis in relation to the visual arts, which included the active toleration of im ages within late antique Judaism. See Fine, Art and Judaism, 82-123. 46. Strong versions, in addition to those cited in n. 44 above, include Margaret Miles, Image as Insight (Boston: Beacon Press, 1985), 43-48; Robin Jensen, Understanding Early Christian Art (London: Routledge, 2000), 8-31; and Andrew Louth, St John Damascene: Tradition and Orig inality in Byzantine Theology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 194-96. 47. The relevant texts are in Mango, The Art of the Byzantine Empire, 16-18, 41-43. 48. As argued in relation to Eusebius by Murray, Rebirth and Afterlife, 25 30. The iconophiles in the eighth century did not need to resort to accusations of forgery in this case: Eusebius's Arianism disqualified his views on the grounds of heresy (Mansi, Sacrorum conciliorum nova, vol. 13, 316A; and Sahas, Icon and Logos, 135). The case for Ephiphanius's opposition to images being "fictitious and inauthentic," "spurious, and written by someone using Epiphanius' name, as has often happened," was already made by John of Damascus in his Orations on the Divine Images 1.25, 2.18, in, for example, Louth, St John Damascene, 202, 206. John was followed by the Seventh Ecumenical Council of 787 (in Mansi, vol. 13, 292E-296E; and Sahas, 117-20). Likewise, many of the texts adduced by iconophiles (such as the florilegia collected by John of Damascus at the end of each of his Orations on the Divine Images) are open to similar accusations as either wholly fictitious or at least elaborations: for the case of Nilus of Sinai, see Hans Georg Thummel, "Neilos von Ancyra und die Bilder," Byzantinische Zeitschrift 71 (1978): 10-21; and Noble, Images, Iconoclasm and the Carolinians, 18. The ma jor modern advocate of the theory of interpolation and rewriting across the testimonia is Paul Speck: see the various items referred to by Barber, Figure and Likeness, 145 n. 4 (which, for the sake of brevity, I will not list here). Skepticism like Speck's (which in my view is in danger of overstating the case for doubt in several cases) is strongly influential on Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclastic Era, for example, 45-50, 94, 208-10, 772, 775. For doubts about following Speck too closely, see Beat Brenk, The Apse, the Image and the Icon (Wiesbaden: Reichart, 2010), 96-97; and Averil Cameron, "The Anxi ety of Images: Meanings and Material Objects," in Images of the Byzan tine World: Visions, Messages and Meanings; Studies Presented to Leslie Bru baker, ed. Angeliki Lymberopoulou (Aldershot, U.K.: Ashgate, 2011), 47-56, esp. 49. 49. The case for Eusebius's letter being genuine has now been made with force: see Stephen Gero, "The True Image of Christ: Eusebius' Letter to Constantia Reconsidered," Journal of Theological Studies 32 (1981): 460-70; it has been accepted (contrary to her earlier position) by Mary Charles Murray, "Le probleme de l'iconophobie et les premiers siecles Chretiens," in Nicee II, 787-1987: Douze sttcles d'images religieuses, ed. Francois Boespflug and Nicolas Lossky (Paris: Cert, 1987), 39-50, esp. 44-49; Hans Georg Thummel, "Eusebios' Brief an Kaiserin Kon stantia," Klio 66 (1984): 210-22; and Claudia Sode and Paul Speck, "Ikonoklasmus vor der Zeit? Der Brief des Eusebios von Kaisareia an Kaiserin Konstantia," Jahrbuch der osterreichischen Byzantinistik 54 (2004): 113-34, with serious doubts about reconstituting anything that might resemble the original text. 50. This is broadly the position elaborated by Noble, Images, Iconoclasm and the Carolingians, 10-45. 51. On image as Scripture among the Manichaeans, see Hans-Joachim Klimkeit, "On the Nature of Manichaean Art," in Studies in Mani chaean Literature and Art, by Manfred Heuser and Klimkeit (Leiden: E.J.

The largest category of our surviving gold glasses (about 50 percent of the 278 whose iconography can be distinguished) are portraits of Christ, the apostles, saints, and orants: for illuminating discussion, see Lucy Grig, "Portraits, Pontiffs and the Christianization of Fourth Cen tury Rome," Papers of the British School at Rome 72 (2004): 203-301, esp. 205-6, with Table 1 and 215-30. Discussions of the relation of icons to portraiture include Andre Grabar, Christian Iconography: A Study of Its Origins (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1968), 60-86; Robin Jensen, Face to Face: Portraits of the Divine in Early Christianity (Minneap olis: Fortress Press, 2005); and Karen Marsengill, "Portraits and Icons: Between Reality and Holiness in Byzantium" (PhD diss., Princeton University, 2010). 56. See Brenk, The Apse, the Image and the Icon, 66-71, for the use of im ages in private veneration of the Virgin in the fourth century, 66-68 on gold glasses. 57. On the roots of icons in ancient portraiture, see, for example, Siri Sande, "Pagan pinakes and Christian Icons: Continuity or Parallelism," Acta ad Archaeologiam et Atrium Historiam Pertinentia 18 (2003): 81-100, esp. 98-99; and Jensen, Face to Face, 35-68 on pre-Christian culture, 131-99 for portraits of Christ and the saints. 58. See Marguerite Rassart-Debergh, "De l'icone paienne a l'icone chre tienne," Le Monde Copte 18 (1990): 39-70; Mathews, "The Emperor and the Icon," for an initial list; and Reiner Sorries, Das Malibu-Tripty chon (Dettelbach: Roll, 2003). V. Rondot is currently creating a cata logue raisonne, I gather. 59. Brown, "A Dark-Age Crisis," 10; his line is broadly followed by most discussions since, such as those cited in nn. 8-11 above, even where the dates given to the rise of the cult of icons may differ. 60. A rare voice against the idea that image veneration was "a sudden in novation in the sixth century (or even the fourth)" is Andrew Louth, Greek East and Latin West: The Church AD 681—1071 (Crestwood, N.Y.: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2007), 43-46, at 45. If the so-called Dia logue of the Monk and Recluse Moschos belongs to the second third of the fifth century, as its most recent editor has argued, then that is sig nificant textual support for an Orthodox cult of icons well before the sixth century. See Alexander Alexakis, "The Dialogue of the Monk and Recluse Moschos Concerning the Holy Icons: An Early Iconophile Text," Dumbarton Oaks Papers 52 (1998): 187-224, esp. 209-10 on the date, and 210-16 on iconophile arguments. 61. Idolatry is a vast field, of course. See, for example, L'idolatrie, Rencon tres de l'Ecole du Louvre (Paris: Documentation Frangaise, 1990); specifically on icons, Anthony Eastmond, "Between Icon and Idol: The Uncertainty of Imperial Images," in Icon and Word: The Power of Images in Byzantium: Studies Presented to Robin Cormack, ed. Eastmond and Liz James (Aldershot, U.K.: Ashgate, 2003), 73-85. 62. For an interesting and subtle account of the relations of Early Chris tian apologetics with the image culture of the Greco-Roman environ ment, see Laura Nasrallah, Christian Responses to Roman Art and Archi tecture: The Second-Century Church amid the Spaces of Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010). But this book is oddly reticent about idols or issues of idolatry, arguably underplaying the polemical counterpart to the culture of apology. 63.

The more recent literature on the Umayyads is more nuanced in seeing a multiplicity of influences on the Arab coinage (not least in relation to the conquest of Jerusalem), but preserves the sense of an iconographic and partly polemical dia logue with the Christians: see N. Jamil, "Caliph and Qutb: Poetry as a Source for Interpreting the Transformation of the Byzantine Cross on Steps on Umayyad Coinage," in Bayt al-Maqdis: Jerusalem and Early Is lam, ed.

In an Iraqi variant, a type that appropriated the Christian orans ico nography was also produced under 'Abd al-Malik's half brother, Bishr ibn Marwan, in the same period. See Luke Treadwell, "The 'Orans' Drachms of Bishr ibn Marwan and the Figural Coinage of the Early Marwanids," in Johns, Bayt al-Maqdis, 223-70. 71.

For example, O. Grabar, "Islam and Iconoclasm," 46. 74. See Ekonomou, Byzantine Rome. 75. I use the word "economy" deliberately; it is the key patristic and Byz antine term for the divine dispensation, and not least God's manage ment of the created world, including man's relations with God and the relations of human beings with each other. See especially Mond zain, Image, Icon, Economy, 18-66, for a semantic discussion of the concept in Greek and Byzantine culture, and 69-170 on the "iconic economy." 76. This is the main topic of Noble, Images, Iconoclasm and the Carolingians, who has transformed the level of discussion on the Carolingian as pects of the problem. 77. Strikingly, Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclastic Era, offer almost no discussion of theology as such, in a monumental volume of more than nine hundred pages. 78. This is a vast topic. See, for example, Jaroslav Pelikan, The Christian Tradition, vol. 2, The Spirit of Eastern Christendom (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974), 37-90; Joan M. Hussey, The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986), 9-29; and Henry Chadwick, East and West: The Making of a Rift in the Church (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), 50-70. 79.

The key discussion is Marie-France Auzepy, "La destruction de l'icone du Christ de la Chalce par Leon III: Propagande ou realite?" Byzan tion 60 (1990): 445-92, which reviews the documentary evidence in detail; also Leslie Brubaker, "The Chalke Gate, the Construction of the Past and the Trier Ivory," Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 23 (1999): 258-85; and Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclas tic Era, 128-35. The strongest independent evidence for the existence of the Chalke Christ before Leo III and therefore for his demolition of it is the reference in the Liber pontificalis, in relation to the pontifi cate of Zacharias (r. 741-52), to the erection of a portico and tower at the Lateran with "a figure of the Savior before the doors [figuram Salvatoris ante fores]"; see Louis Duchesne, ed., Liber pontificalis, vol. 1 (Paris: E. de Boccard, 1955), 432. This looks very like an iconophile riposte to Leo's act of iconoclasm—"a silent rebuke of Constantino ple's religious position." See the discussion of John Haldon and Brian Ward-Perkins, "Evidence from Rome for the Image of Christ at the Chalke Gate," Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 23 (1999): 286-96, esp. 288, 295. Despite what is now the prevailing view, some still ac cept the Chalke Christ and its demolition, for example, Bissera V. Pentcheva, The Sensual Icon: Space, Ritual and the Senses in Byzantium (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2010), 63. 92. On Irene's "restoration" of the image, see Mango, The Brazen House, 121-22. 93. On Leo V's iconoclasm of the Chalke Christ, see ibid., 122. 94. The iconoclasts' image of a cross at the Chalke Gate is attested by a group of poems, one of which appears to have been its inscription. However, it is not clear whether the epigrams relate to a cross set up by Leo III and Constantine before the Second Council of Nicaea or one set up by Leo V after he removed Irene's icon of Christ. See ibid., 118-19, 122; and Gero, "Hypatius of Ephesus," 113-26. 95. Mango, The Brazen House, 125-32. 96.

Pace the claims of Gero, Byzantine Iconoclasm, 97-103; Brubaker, "On the Margins," 109-11, reviews the evidence trenchantly. Generic and hyperbolic references aside, we have only five acts of destruction de scribed with any specificity in the texts and one more attested ar chaeologically. This evidence touches on only Constantinople and its immediate environs (Nicaea). See also Brubaker and Haldon, Byzan tium in the Iconoclast Era, 199-212. 99. On acheiropoieta, see Dobschutz, Christusbilder; Eva Kuryluk, Veronica and Her Cloth (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991), 28-33; Belting, Likeness and Presence, 47-77; Herbert Kessler and Gerhard Wolf, eds., The Holy Face and the Paradox of Representation (Bologna: Nuova Alfa Editoriale, 1998), esp. the essays by Hans Belting, Averil Cameron, J.

See Louth, St John Damascene, 3—8, for details. The case that at least in part John was writing against iconophobic attitudes among local Pales tinian Christians living under the caliphate has been made by Sidney Griffith, "John of Damascus and the Church of Syria in the Umayyad Era: The Intellectual and Cultural Milieu of Orthodox Christians in the World of Islam," Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies 11 (2008): 1—32. 101. See Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclast Era: The Sources, 248; and Louth, St John Damascene, 208. Paul Speck, Artabasdos, der rechtglaubige Vorkampfer des gottlichen Lehren (Bonn: Habelt, 1981), 179 243, characteristically goes for a different view and places the three orations after the Ecumenical Council of 754. Note that no one has doubted that the order in which we refer to them (from 1 to 3) re flects the actual order of writing. 102. For the text, see Bonifatius Kotter, Die Schriften des Johannes von Damas kos, vol. 3, Contra imaginum calumniatores orationes tres (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1975). I use (with adaptations) the translations of David An derson, in On the Divine Images by Saint John of Damascus (Westwood, N.Y.: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1980); and Andrew Louth, in Three Treatises on the Divine Images, by Saint John of Damascus (Westwood, N.Y.: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2003).

See Henry, "What Was the Iconoclastic Controversy About?" 25-26, who rightly sees that John moved the debate from questions of idola try to "whether any material aids were permissible in worship"; also Marie-France Auzepy, "L'iconodoulie: Defense de l'image ou de la devotion a l'image?" in Boespflug and Lossky, Nicee II, 157-66. 106.

On the image of Christ, see, for example, Martin Buchsel, "Das Chris tusportrat am Scheideweg des Ikonoklastenstreits im 8. und 9. Jahr hunderts," Marburger Jahrbuch fur Kunstwissenschaft 25 (1998): 7-52; and idem, Die Entstehung des Christusportrats (Mainz: Philipp von Za bern, 2003). On the importance of inscriptions in relation to images of Christ, see Karen Boston, "The Power of Inscriptions and the Trou ble with Texts," in Eastmond and Tames, Icon and Word, 35-57, esp. 37-46. 108. See Parry, Depicting the Word, 168. 109. I think this view is excessively inflected by Protestant assumptions, and as a historical explanation it is simplistically monocausal. But see, for example, Martin, A History of the Iconoclastic Controversy, 112-24. 110. See, for example, David Gwynn, "From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy," Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007): 225-51. 111. For the horos of Hiereia, contained in and refuted by the acts of the Seventh Ecumenical Council of Nicaea in 787 (is it correctly, fully, or fairly reported there?), see Herman Hennephof, Textus byzantinos ad Iconomachiam pertinentes (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1969), 61-78; Stephen Gero, Byzantine Iconoclasm during the Reign of Constantine V (Louvain: Corpussco, 1977), 68-94, which conveniently has the Greek text as well as an English translation; and Torsten Krannich, Christophe Schubert, and Claudia Sode, eds., Die Ikonoklastische Synode von Hiereia 754 (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002). Discussions include Milton Anastos, "The Ethical Theory of Images Formulated by the Iconoclasts in 754 and 815," Dumbarton Oaks Papers 8 (1954): 153-60; idem, "The Argument for Iconoclasm as Presented by the Iconoclastic Council of 754," in Weitzmann, Late Classical and Mediaeval Studies, 177-88; Gero, Byzantine Iconoclasm during the Reign of Constantine V, 68-110; Noble, Images, Iconoclasm and the Carolingians, 94-99; and Brubaker and Hal don, Byzantium in the Iconoclast Era, 189-97. 112. At 213A the horos has Lucifer lead man into "worshiping the creature rather than the Creator [irapd tov KTiaavTa iTpoaKUveiv UTro0ejievos]," some thing direcdy associated with idolatry at 22 ID. This is a reversal of John of Damascus's Oratio 1.4, "I do not adore the creation rather than the Creator [ov TTpoaicuvu) Tfi KTiaei Trapa tov KTiaavTa]Idolatry on both these lines is implicitly worship of creation. 113. The text is in Hennephof, Textus byzantinos, 52-57 with discussions by, for example, Gero, Byzantine Iconoclasm during the Reign of Constantine V, 37-52; and Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclast Era, 179-82. For the influence of the Peuseis on the horos of Hiereia, see Gero, 41-43, 96; Hans Georg Thummel, Die Konzilien zur Bilderfrage im 8. und 9. Jahrhundert (Paderborn: Schoningh, 2005), 65-68; and No ble, Images, Iconoclasm and the Carolingians, 94-95. 114. On the Christology of the horos, see Schonborn, L'icdne de Christ, 170 78; Krannich et al., Die Ikonoklastische Synode, 12-15, and on its rela tions with John of Damascus, 26-27; and Giakalis, Images of the Divine, 93-101. 115. On circumscription and uncircumscribability, see Parry, Depicting the Word, 97-113. 116. As implied by the commentary on this passage in the acts of the Sec ond Council of Nicaea (256C), which has a touch of self-righteous bluster about how this is "rhetorical" and a false declaration. 117. On the Eucharist in iconoclast thought, see Stephen Gero, "The Eu charistic Doctrine of the Byzantine Iconoclasts and Its Sources," Byzan tinische Zeitschrift 68 (1975): 4-22; and Parry, Depicting the Word, 178 90. 118. The worries of the iconoclast Council of St. Sophia in 815 about the images of saints, and the attempt there (so far as we can trust our ex iguous sources, themselves excerpts from Patriarch Nicephorus's refu tation of this council's deliberations) to justify the rejection of icons of holy personages, perhaps hint that the Council of 815 saw Hiereia as having somewhat fudged this issue. See (rather obscurely) Paul J. Alexander, The Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople (Oxford: Claren don Press, 1958), 44-45. 119. The evidence of iconoclasm conducted on images of the Virgin and Child—notably, the apse mosaic at the Church of the Koimesis at Ni caea—indicates that the image of the Christ Child was no less signifi cant than that of the mature Jesus. See, for example, Charles Barber, "The Koimesis Church, Nicaea: The Limits of Representation on the Eve of Iconoclasm," Jahrbuch der Osterreichischen Byzantinistik 41 (1991): 43-60; and idem, "Theotokos and Logos: The Interpretation and Re interpretation of the Sanctuary Program of the Koimesis Church, Ni caea," in Images of the Mother of God, ed. Maria Vassilaki (Aldershot, U.K.: Ashgate, 2005), 51-59. Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclast Era, 206, rightly point out that the Virgin and Child is not the only possible option for what the iconoclast image of a cross re placed in this church. 120. I find the translation offered by Sahas, Icon and Logos, 149-50, rather garbled, so I have supplemented it with the versions of Philip Schaff, Christian Classics Ethereal Library, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff /npnf214.xvi.x.html; and Gero, Byzantine Iconoclasm, 87. 121. Gero, Byzantine Iconoclasm, 107, reads this as meaning that there was plenty of iconoclastic activity, which this ruling attempts to limit, but that is by no means the only or most obvious interpretation. 122. See Parry, Depicting the Word, 193-95. 123. On the ecumenical status of the Second Council of Nicaea, see Marie France Auzepy, L'hagiographie et Viconoclasme byzantin (Aldershot, U.K.: Ashgate, 1999), 211-28; and Thummel, Die Konzilien zur Bilderfrage, 194-95; generally on Nicaea II, see Thummel, 87-213; and Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclastic Era, 260-76. 124.

Mansi, Sacrorum conciliorum nova, vol. 13, 377DE. 128. The problem is philological. Does horizomen (we ordain) plus the in finitive carry the sense of permission (icons may be set up) or the sense of obligation (icons should be set up)? Among recent versions, Sahas, Icon and Logos, 179 (used by Noble, Images, Iconoclasm and the Carolingians, 101-2) is permissive, while Alexander, The Patriarch Nice phorus, 21; Schonborn, L'icdne de Christ, 143; and Joseph Munitiz (in Belting, Likeness and Presence, 506) are prescriptive, as is the recent unpublished version by Thomas Mathews, which I use here with his permission (I am persuaded by his argument on the issue, which is still unpublished, and I am most grateful for his discussion of the topic with me). The Greek and Latin versions (with a French transla tion) are conveniently available in Marie-France Auzepy, " 'Horos' du concile Nicee II," in Boespflug and Lossky, Nicee II, 32-35; her French version oddly makes the infinitive an indicative, representing a cur rent state of affairs with no emphasis on either permission or obliga tion. For recent discussion, see Uphus, Der Horos des Zweiten Konzils, 202-3. 129. See Martin, A History of the Iconoclastic Controversy, 160-70; and Bru baker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclast Era, 366-452. 130. On the Council of 815, see Paul Alexander, "The Iconoclastic Council of St Sophia (815) and Its Definition (Horos)," Dumbarton Oaks Papers 7 (1953): 35-66; with the counterarguments of Anastos, "The Ethical Theory of Images"; and further discussion in Alexander, The Patriarch Nicephorus, 137-40; also Thummel, Die Konzilien zur Bilderfrage, 230 45; Noble, Images, Iconoclasm and the Carolingians, 245-50; and Bru baker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclastic Era, 372-76.

Interestingly, this version of iconoclasm—the moving, not the breaking, of images—had been suggested to Nicephorus by Leo V in 814 but rejected by the patriarch. See Martin, A History of the Iconoclastic Controversy, 165; and Alexander, The Patriarch Nicephorus, 128. 136. Interestingly, Theodore of Studion, Epistola 1.17, approves of precisely this last use of images as godparents; see Mango, The Art of the Byzan tine Empire, 174. 137. See Robert Taft, The Liturgy of the Hours East and West (Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press, 1986), 276; idem, The Byzantine Rite: A Short History (Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press, 1992), 52-54; Thomas Pott, La reforme liturgique byzantine: Etude du phenomene de revolution non spontanee de la liturgie byzantine (Rome: Edizioni Liturgiche, 2000), 110-13; and Alexander Rentel, "Byzantine and Slavic Orthodoxy," in The Oxford History of Christian Worship, ed. Geoffrey Wainwright and Karen Westerfield Tucker (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 254-306, esp. 262-63. 138. Since one of the principal liturgical poets of Mar Saba was John of Damascus (see Louth, St John Damascene, 252-82) and the major litur gical reformer was Theodore of Studion, it is striking that liturgical transformation and the defense of icons went together so closely. 139. See Anna Kartsonis, Anastasis: The Making of an Image (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986), 126-86; Jas Eisner, "Image and Iconoclasm in Byzantium," Art History 11 (1988): 471-91, esp. 475-77, 482-85; Gilbert Dagron, D'ecrire et peindre: Essai sur le portrait iconique (Paris: Gallimard, 2007), esp. 31-63, for iconoclasm, the iconophilic response, and their effects; Charles Barber, Contesting the Logic of Paint ing: Art and Understanding in Eleventh-Century Byzantium (Leiden: Brill, 2007), for conceptual attitudes to images in the wake of iconoclasm. 140. Freedberg, The Power of Images, 415, but following suggestions already in John of Damascus 2.61, 66; with Parry, Depicting the Word, 25. On image and prototype in general, see ibid., 22-33. 141. Of course, this did not prevent post-eventum iconophile apologists from attacking the iconoclasts precisely as attempting to damage the proto type (see Parry, Depicting the Word, 33, on Nicephorus)—as in the fa mous images preserved in the ninth-century marginal Psalters. See Kathleen Corrigan, Visual Polemics in the Ninth-Century Byzantine Psalters (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992). But this is polemic: no Byzantine iconoclast would have claimed to be attacking Christ. 142. Osborne, "The Repudiation of Representation," 68-70; and Parry, Depicting the Word, 70-80. 143. Basil, On the Holy Spirit 18.45. 144. Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclast Era, 782-87 also con clude that Byzantine iconoclasm was about representation. However, their concern is not with a conceptual issue in the theory of images but with what they characterize as "social" representation ("how we display, present or project ourselves, to ourselves and others," 783) and "cultural" representation ("how authors and artisans present themselves, or, usually, others, to an audience. This type of represen tation is governed by what is usually called genre," 783). They argue that theology is "largely beside the point" (783) and that it "followed along and either codified changes in social practice or attempted to limit them" (784). They claim further that theologians "justified or codified existing realities" (784). As is obvious from my argument, I think this excessively emphasizes realism as a historical extrapolation from rhetorical and philosophically inclined sources (which is an act of faith on the part of the historian), and I also think that art histori cally, it underplays the long conceptual tradition on the nature of the image's relation to the "presence" of its prototype, which the debates in the period of iconoclasm effectively resolved. But their social and cultural point in general is certainly valid, even if we may worry that it is too functionalist, and we may want to add that theological thinking also created new realities as well as justifying and codifying existing ones. 145. The principal modern theorist of this theme in Greek antiquity is Jean-Pierre Vernant, Figures, idoles, masques (Paris: Julliard, 1990), 31 40; and idem, Mortals and Immortals: Collected Essays (Princeton: Prince ton University Press, 1991), 151-63 (esp. 152-53), 168; with the out standing discussion of Richard Neer, "Jean-Pierre Vernant and the History of the Image," Arethusa 43 (2010): 181-96; also the critique of Philip Hardie, Ovid's Poetics of Illusion (Cambridge: Cambridge Univer sity Press, 2002), 90-91, 191-93. Note that scholars of ancient Greece have been much more hesitant to ascribe assumptions of real pres ence even to archaic Greek images than have, for example, scholars of ancient Egypt; see Jan Assmann, The Search for God in Ancient Egypt (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2001), 40-47, esp. "The gods do not 'dwell' on earth .. . they 'install' themselves in their images" (43) or "the statue is not the image of the deity's body, but the body itself' (46, in italics in the original). For some discussion of real pres ence in relation to Greek religious images, see Waldemar Deonna, "L'image incomplete ou mutilee," Revue des Etudes Anciennes 32 (1930): 321-32, esp. 324, 326, and on iconoclasm, 328-30; Burkhard Gladigow, "Prasenz der Bilder-Prasenz der Gotter: Kultbilder und Bilder der Gotter in der griechischen Religion," Visible Religion 4-5 (1985-86): 114-33; and Tanja Scheer, Die Gottheit und ihr Bild: Unter suchungen zur Funktion griechischer Kultbilder in Religion und Politik (Mu nich: Beck, 2000), 44-129. 146.

There is a very rich literature on this set of issues now.

Ecphrastic Epigram and the Poetics of Simulation," Ameri can Journal of Philology 131 (2010): 589-634; and idem, The Iliad in a Nutshell: Visualizing Epic on the Tabulae Iliacae (Oxford: Oxford Univer sity Press, 2011), 303-70. 150. Many ramifications of this theme are powerfully discussed in Verity Piatt, "Making an Impression: Replication and the Ontology of the Graeco-Roman Seal Stone," Art History 29 (2006): 233-57; and idem, Facing the Gods, 170-332. 151. There is a major literature on this theme.

By contrast with Protestant theory and practice, the Catholic apologia for images has been distinctly less discussed. See, for example, Giuseppe Scavizzi, Arte e architettura sacra: Cronache e documenti sulla controversia tra riformatori e cattolici (1500—1550) (Reggio: Cam del Li bro, 1982), 236-63; Paolo Prodi, Ricerca sulla teorica delle arti figurative nela Riforma Cattolica (Bologna: I Nuovi Alpi Editoriale, 1984); Feld, Die Ikonoklasmus des Western, 193—215; and, at length, Christian Hecht, Katholische Bildertheologie im Zeitalter von Gegenreformation und Barock (Berlin: Gebriider Mann Verlag, 1997).

The issues are well summarized by Brubaker and Haldon, Byzantium in the Iconoclastic Era, 777-79. 156. See the remarks of C.
