<plain_text><page sequence="1">NARRATIVE THREADS: THE PIENZA COPE'S EMBROIDERED VITAE AND THEIR RITUAL SETTING Wendy R. Larson The Pienza Cope (Fig. 1), now in the Museo diocesano di Pienza, is an out standing example of opus anglicanum, or "work of the English," the distinctive style of elaborately-worked embroideries produced in England from the mid-thirteenth through the mid-fourteenth centuries.1 Created in the late phase of this period, be tween 1310 and 1330, the Pienza Cope represents the height of the style's lush patterns, vivid colors, and use of precious gold thread, pearls, and gems.2 Although we do not know for whom the cope was originally made, it was clearly intended for a person or position of high ecclesiastical rank.3 Copes might be worn by any member of the clergy, including cantors. They were associated with high festivals as well as benedictions, weddings, burials, and church consecrations. Copes were the appropriate outerwear for processions; their shape restricted the movement of the arms, which meant that they were not worn by the eucharistie celebrant, who wore a chasuble.4 However, the celebrant might wear a cope for performing the ceremony of Asperges before the mass, or a greater prelate who was present, but not the celebrant, at mass might wear a cope during the service. Overwhelming in splendor and size—a semicircle eleven-and-a-half-feet wide, five feet, four-and-a-half inches tall, and made primarily of gold thread, the whole shimmering surface alive with pattern and originally covered with tiny pearls5—the Pienza Cope was a festal gar ment worn to be admired and to impress. The Pienza Cope is remarkable not only for the quality of its embroidery and pristine condition, but even more so for its decorative program, which, like most late-phase opus anglicanum copes, is structured in concentric arcades that provide elaborate architectural frames for scenes across its expanse (Fig. 2).6 The cope's decorative scheme is composed of scenes from the lives of three holy women: the Virgin Mary and Saints Margaret of Antioch and Catherine of Alexandria. The top two arcades are devoted to the life of the Virgin, and include her Presentation at the Temple, Betrothal, Annunciation, Nativity, and the related Annunciation to the Shepherds, Adoration of the Magi (Fig. 3), and Presentation to St. Simeon. In addi tion to the Coronation of the Virgin, the remaining five scenes portray the events Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 139</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

The Pienza Cope, diagram. (From A. G. I. Christie, English Medieval Embroidery [Oxford, 1938], 180.) surrounding the Virgin's Death and Assumption. These scenes—the Virgin's Death Foretold, Death of the Virgin, Funeral Procession of the Virgin, Apostles Told of Mary's Assumption, and Apostles at Mary's Bier—are arranged not in chronolog ical order, but along the top edge of the cope so that when it is worn the scenes appear on the front. The bottom arcade is divided, reading from left to right, between six scenes representing the life of St. Margaret and seven depicting the life of St. Catherine. In the top row of spandrels, between the two tiers of Mary's life, are nine figures of Christ's ancestors, a type of horizontal Jesse Tree, each person holding an identifying banner. In the lower set of spandrels, the twelve apostles appear, each holding a banner with an article of the Creed.7 Medieval embroidered images are most typically individual scenes or narrative sequences from the lives of Christ or the Virgin Mary and emblematic images of saints. Although there are many extant examples of narrative embroidery, both from the opus anglicanum period and other medieval sources, the Pienza Cope is the unique surviving instance of the presentation of more than two narratives and exclu sively female lives.8 The closest parallels in terms of portraying more than one life are the Syon Cope (1300-20) and the cope at the Church of St. Maximin (late thir teenth century), which both feature scenes from the lives of Christ and the Virgin.9 A watercolor sketch of a now-lost cope from the Vatican documents a triple Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 141 The iVienza Cope 1315-50 Figure 2.

The Madrid Cope (ca. 1300) recounts the first four chapters of Genesis, from the Creation to the death of Abel and curse of Cain.12 The Bologna Cope (1315-35) is similar to the Pienza Cope in design, but with just two levels of arcading, which feature Christ's Infancy and Passion narratives, and a single scene of the martyrdom of Thomas Becket.13 There are also examples of European narrative embroideries, such as the thirteenth-century Icelandic and four teenth-century French lives of St. Martin, although these were probably made as altar frontals, rather than vestments.14 Several roundels from a series illustrating the life of St. Catherine of Alexandria are also extant.15 Undoubtedly there were many more. Although there is no lack of narrative medieval embroidery, the Pienza Cope's use of multiple narratives and the specific combination of three women's lives is striking.16 The Pienza Cope provides a useful opportunity to weave together three threads of inquiry: the reception of images on a vestment, the specific content of these three female saints' lives, and the function of hagiographie pictorial narrative. This article explores the symbolic significance of vestments as discussed in treatises for the clergy who would be wearing them and poems written for the members of a congregation who would be viewing them. It then considers various understand ings of the association between the Virgin and Saints Margaret and Catherine to sug gest ways in which the cope's narrative content may have been read by both those observing the cope and the person wearing it in its ritual setting. Symbolic Significance of Vestments The gold thread, pearls, and wide sweep of the Pienza Cope would have made it a garment of eye-catching quality that would be difficult to ignore. Copes of its quality would be reserved for especially important festivals and the most elite wearers. The scenes of the Funeral Procession and Assumption of the Virgin, which are clustered around the neck of the garment, suggest it was worn on holy days associated with Mary, such as the feast of the Dormition, as well as the feast days of Saints Margaret and Catherine. The material splendor of the cope can be read simply as a sign of the power and prestige of the body that it adorns as well as of the patron who proffered such a magnificent gift. Copes, like other vestments, were objects that could also be read as spiritual allegories and thus functioned as sources of contemplation for members of a Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 143</page><page sequence="6">congregation. Priests usually vested at the altar, which made the procedure a focus for the congregation in the interval between Matins and the mass. The significance of vestments for laypeople observing their ritual use is illustrated by John Lydgate in "The Interpretation and Virtues of the Mass" (1427-30): Ye folkys all, whyche haue deuocioun To here masse, furst do your besy cure With all your inward contemplacion, As in a myrrour presentyng in fygure The morall menyng of that gostly armure, When that a preest, with mynystres more &amp; lasse, Arayeth hymsylf, by record of scripture, The same howre when he shall go to masse.17 According to Lydgate, meditation on the priest's vestments ought to be part of the layperson's overall worship experience and should serve as the first step in mentally preparing oneself for the mass. Later in his poem, Lydgate offers some elaboration of what he intends by "moral meaning": Vppon hys heede An Amyte [amice] furst he leythe. Whycche ys a sygne, a token, and a fygure, Owtward a shewyng, groundyd on the feythe. The large Awbe [alb], by record of scripture, Ys ryghtwysnesse, perpetually to indure.

(145-68) The cope is not among the items described because it was not a eucharistie vestment, and therefore not something a priest would put on before performing the mass, although he might have been wearing one before donning his chasuble. However, Lydgate's description of the significance of the priest's amice, alb, girdle, maniple, stole, and chasuble makes clear that these items and their spiritual significance were expected to be understood by the laypeople observing their use. These garments were meant to be read as representing aspects of the purity and spiritual clarity needed by a member of the clergy who represented the people before God, thus dis pelling the potential conflict between the beauty of vestments and the "contryte hert and lowe confessiowne" expected of the person who wore them. The anonymous author of another early fifteenth-century English guide for laypeople, "Meditacyons for goostly exercyse in the tyme of the Masse," moves in the direction of narrative rather than simple symbolism.18 Just as the whole mass may be understood as a reenactment of Christ's Passion, in this text, the vestments that a priest wears while performing the mass function as miniature tableaux of that larger drama. Declaring "our Intent ys to move soolles to the devotyon of the masse, and to the lovyng Remembrance of the Passyon of Cryste," the following medita tions are offered: When the fanelle [maniple] ys put on the Lefte hand. Remember the roips with the whiche, the knyghtes dyd bynd our Sauyoures handes, when thai dyd Leyd hym fro Tyrant to Tyrant. When the stoole ys cast ouer hys necke and crossyd on the breist. Have medytatyon of the bosteous roipys, wherwith the turmentors dyd drawe hys blyssyd body on the crosse so sore, that alle hys Ioynttes [joints] was dyssoluyd, and hys Scenowys [sinews] and vaynys [veins] alle to brast [burst]. When the prest castyth on hys ouermest vestment, callyd a chesible.

Here vestments function literally as layers of signification that are placed upon the body of the celebrant who enacts the narrative of Christ's passion and death. The Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 145</page><page sequence="8">text presents observing worshippers as part of this production of meaning through their meditative linking of the garments and the events that they are said to signify. The expectation that laypeople not only understood that vestments were special gar ments setting apart the wearer, but also that individual items carried particular spiritual messages is made clear. In both cases copes are not specifically mentioned because they would not have been worn by the celebrant at mass; unsurprisingly, manuals for laypeople focused on the vestments that would be seen during the eucharistie rite rather than on less frequent processions or other types of services.20 Although these poems were written a century after the Pienza Cope was made, the use and signification of vestments did not shift perceptibly during this period. Unlike a wall painting or statue that might also serve as a basis for contem plation, the message of a vestment is intimately joined with the person who wears it. In the "Meditacyons" text the priest's actions in putting on the vestments gain significance since they are direct echoes of Christ's actions. For Lydgate, the spiritual qualities that each vestment symbolizes are sources of the priest's moral authority: "A parfyte preste made strong with thy Armure, / Tofore the Auter as Crystes champioune, / Shall stond vpryght" (161-63). Just as a vestment must be worn in order to take on meaning, so the person wearing it embodies that meaning. The tradition of symbolic significance attached to a priest's vestments goes back to the biblical description of what the first priests, Aaron and his sons, were to wear (Ex. 28). Paul discusses the "armor of God" (Eph. 6:10-17), which Lydgate echoes in his description of the priest's vestments as "spiritual armor." Patristic writers also offered allegorical readings of vestments; for example, Gregory of Nyssa described them as the "articles of clothing which symbolically instruct concerning priestly virtues under the form of clothing."21 John Mirk, in his Manuale Sacerdotis (1380-1420), stressed the importance of striking a balance between appropriately attractive vestments and modesty: "the priest should vest himself in moderate vest ments and adequate clothing, not excessively valuable, nor too mean, for in one is hypocrisy, in the other is pride."22 This explicit connection between the outside covering and the inner state of the wearer is a matter of concern in texts written for the instruction of the clergy. William Durandus, Bishop of Mende (1230-96), wrote a handbook for priests entitled Rationale divinorum officiorum (1286). Its third book, devoted entirely to the subject of vestments, makes explicit the reciprocal relationship between sacred garments and their wearer: "therefore the bishop or priest, willing to celebrate mass, must adorn himself with apparel according to his order, and the quality of his actions must be suited to his vesture's ornament."23 The spiritual state of the wearer must match the allegory that his vestments spell out.24 The images represented are also of 146 Narrative Threads</page><page sequence="9">importance to those witnessing the wearer. For example, Durandus also explains the purpose of placing sacred images in a church: "Generally the images of the holy fathers are depicted on the walls of the church, or on the back panels of the altar, or on sacred vestments and in various other places so that we may meditate contin uously, not with divided attention or uselessly, on their holiness."25 Vestments are just one source of images that may be used for contemplation of divine virtues. As other authors of handbooks for priests note, it is important that celebrants keep their thoughts on holy matters. However, Durandus specifically discusses the significance of wearing images, rather than only looking at them: "To bear the fathers thus imprinted on the breast is to meditate on those ancient lives without intermission. But the priest steps without blame when he gazes continually on the example of the fathers who have gone before, when he considers without ceasing the footsteps of the saints, and represses unholy thoughts, lest he put the foot of his works outside the limits of prayer."26 Durandus accords the wearing of saints' images a particular efficacy: "to bear the fathers ... imprinted on the breast" is "to meditate" on their lives; wearing is, in other words, a form of meditation, an absorption of the qualities of those saints by a kind of divine osmosis. Durandus bases the mystical power of vestments to fuse the spiritual and physical on the traditional symbolic understanding of vestments mentioned earlier, making specific reference to the ephod of Aaron (Ex. 28:9-12) that had stones placed on each shoulder engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. Belief in the transformative power of wearing vestments was a venerable tradition. Philo of Alexandria noted the correspondence of various liturgical garments to the four elements and the profound effect of such clothing on the one wearing it: "as he wears a vesture which represents the world, his first duty is to carry the pattern enshrined in his heart, and so be in a sense transformed from a man into the nature of the world; and ... be himself a little world, a microcosm."27 For Philo, the symbolic nature of the liturgical garments transfigures the one wearing them so that they convey meaning that transcends their individual person. Wearing holy words or images provides a metaphysical link to the divine, which neither viewing nor reading alone can provide. Aaron was able to represent all Israelites when he wore the engraved stones on his ephod; a priest who wears the image of a saint may represent the human variations on the divine narrative, and himself become a symbol of those concepts of sanctity, transformed by wearing them. Images may be used to both instruct and inspire, but images that are worn on vestments carry a unique power and significance, because they are literally embodied by the wearer and function as a physical sign of the ecclesiast's privileged position between the people and God.28 Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 147</page><page sequence="10">Durandus's description of the allegorical meaning of a cope stresses par ticularly the human, mortal body inside the cope and its future transformation, represented by the outer beauty of the garment: There is another vestment which is called the pluvial or cope, which is believed to have been borrowed from the Tunic of the Law. Therefore, as that was decorated with little bells, this is with fringes, which are the labors and anxieties of this world. It also has a hood, which is heavenly joy. It is long, reaching to the feet, which signifies per severance to the end. In the front part it is open, to denote that eternal life is open for those who conduct holy lives and that their own life ought to be open as an example for others. And further, by the cope we understand the glorious immortality of our bodies. Therefore, we wear it only for the greater festivals, beholding the future resurrection, when the elect, laying aside the body, will receive two garments: namely the soul's rest and the body's glory. This cope also properly stands open on the inside and is joined only by one necessary fastening, because the body, now made spiritual, will not nar rowly constrict the soul. And it is ornamented below with a fringe because we will not at all stray into imperfection, but that which we know now in part, we will know then as we have been fully known.29 In Durandus's reading, the cope that covers the wearer's body is a physical sign of that body's coming transformation; the sumptuous garment a mere ghost of the coming "body's glory." The cope obscures the wearer's form, extending from the neck to the toes, yet it heralds the eschatological revelation when what is now hid den shall be known. The use of the pronoun "we," indicating the clergy to whom Durandus's text was addressed, underlines the recognition that although some of this meaning might be apprehended by those looking at the cope from without, the message of physical transformation would surely make a more dramatic and im mediate impact upon the one whose body was the site of such signification. The Cope's Scenes of Feminine Power Given the powerful and intimate connection between vestment and wearer as set out by Durandus, is it at all incongruent that a male ecclesiast would wear an item such as the Pienza Cope, adorned with scenes of feminine power as depicted in the lives of the Virgin Mary and Saints Margaret and Catherine? Caroline Bynum and others have demonstrated that male religious were able to appropriate feminine models of piety and holiness in ways that ultimately affirmed their devotion.30 Therefore, an ecclesiast would not at all be disturbed by the thought that, by wearing the narratives of three female saints, he would be absorbing their spiritual qualities. 148 Narrative Threads</page><page sequence="11">In the case of the Pienza Cope, the recognized power of these women would make such a concept quite attractive. The Virgin and Saints Margaret and Catherine were especially honored for their roles as great intercessors, which made them partic ularly worthy of veneration and figures with whom a close alliance would be desirable. Acting as intercessor on behalf of the congregation, whether consecrating a church, performing a benediction, or processing into mass, an ecclesiast garbed in the narratives of these women would be able to appropriate and embody their intercessory power. The Virgin Mary, as the chaste Mother of God, bridged the gap between the needs and concerns of the wedded and unwedded; the sorrows she suffered as a mother enabled her to intercede on behalf of those who prayed to her son. The two central panels of the cope illustrate the source of this power: the Nativity and the Coronation of the Virgin.31 St. Margaret and St. Catherine were both Early Christian virgin martyrs who, at the moment of their martyrdom, prayed for and were granted great intercessory powers. Margaret asked that those who recalled her life and prayed to her would receive forgiveness of sins, and Catherine requested a divine blessing for all those who called on her at the moment of death. As a result of their remark able powers, it is not surprising that Margaret and Catherine were the focus of two immensely popular cults in late medieval Europe. The three women's lives em broidered on the cope exemplified the kind of intercessory powers the Church claimed for itself: intimacy with Christ and the ability to forgive sins and bless the soul at the moment of death. It seems clear that the Pienza Cope was regarded as a fitting token of the Church's power as embodied in the person honored by its use; it was an object for which a patron was willing to pay an enormous sum, and one that was carefully preserved. And yet, the presence of these three particular holy women on a garment intended to be worn by a representative of the Church may not only have served to celebrate the Church's ability to appropriate their intercessory power. The alle gorical message of a cope may be read by both the wearer and the observer, yet their positions inside or outside the garment itself may shade their reading. Similarly, those who viewed the Pienza Cope during its ritual use might have had multiple ways of reading the significance of the narratives it contained, depending on their social or institutional positions. For instance, although Bynum asserts that both men and women might be devotees of a female saint, possibly even for the same reasons, such as the virgin martyrs' example of chastity, she also asserts that women would appropriate or occupy the position of their saintly role models in a different way. Being a "bride of Christ" would be a variation on an already familiar social role for a woman, whereas for a male such a concept required a far more radical break with Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 149</page><page sequence="12">secular norms. Likewise, in Virgin Martyrs, Karen Winstead lays particular em phasis on the multivalency of virgin martyr lives and how "these legends could be construed simultaneously in radically different ways and thus serve conflicting interests."32 The cope presents narratives of bodily empowerment—the stories of "weak" women whose bodies were sites of miracles—that are open to a variety of readings, much as the cope and the body wearing it are also open to interpretation. In addition to the reading of intercessory power at the time of death and heroic preservation of chastity, the narratives of the Virgin Mary and of Saints Margaret and Catherine also positioned them as benefactors of mothers. The way in which the cope portrays its hagiographie narratives, particularly the scenes which were of especial interest to several groups of viewers, makes its decorative scheme of nar rative sequences rather than single emblematic images important. As noted earlier, the top two central panels on the cope represent the Corona tion of the Virgin and the Nativity, both scenes that help to define the Virgin's special relationship with her son.33 The Coronation's customary location at the top center, whether on copes or chasubles, makes it the most prominent image on a vestment because it lays flat on the wearer's upper back. The central panel of the Pienza Cope shows the Nativity, or childbed of Mary (Fig. 4), an image that was often a focus of devotion for women who wished to have a child.34 Of the eleven Nativity scenes in opus anglicanum work, a midwife only appears three other times, on copes that are all structurally similar to the Pienza Cope.35 In these representa tions, the midwife is prominently placed in the center of the scene holding the Christ child. Although the midwife serves a doctrinal purpose in underlining Mary's purity (according to the Protevangelium of James, the doubting midwife's hand shrivels when she attempts to test Mary's virginity), certainly the presence of a midwife at a birth brought with it associations of contemporary childbirth, especially for devo tees of the Nativity image. Placing the midwife as the central figure of the entire cope permits non-doctrinal and especially feminine concerns to be discerned in it, along with the authorized reading of intercessory power.36 Like Mary, St. Margaret was also the focus of special devotion from both un married and married laywomen37 as well as male and female religious. Although she rejected marriage with the Roman magistrate Olibrius and accepted death as the price for preserving her chastity, in her final prayer before her martyrdom St. Margaret also promised her assistance to women who called on her in childbirth. The image of Margaret rising from the dragon was understood by the Late Middle Ages as an emblem for the safe delivery of a child. In order to emerge from the dragon's belly, however, Margaret had to be swallowed by the dragon, yet this criti cal part of her legend came under attack very early in the development of her cult. 150 Narrative Threads</page><page sequence="13">Figure 4. The Nativity. The Pienza Cope, detail; Pienza, Museo diocesano di Pienza. (Photo: By permission of the Ministero per i Beni e la Attivitâ Culturali Soprintendenza PSAeD di Siena e Grosseto.) Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 151</page><page sequence="14">Two texts popular in fourteenth-century England specifically critiqued this scene: the Legenda Aurea (ca. 1260) declared it "apocryphal and frivolous," and the South English Legendary (1260-88) account contended that such an event cannot be "truth."38 The cope's rendition of the incident makes it clear that Margaret is emerg ing from within the dragon, and not merely standing on top of it (in fact, she's still in it from the knees down). Some similar discomfort with Margaret's defeat of her second demonic enemy led to a condensing and downplaying of the scene. In the fullest versions of the scene, Margaret is confronted with an anthropomorphic demon immediately after defeating the demon in reptilian form. She successfully binds him and pins him with her foot on his neck, forcing him to confess to his tactics in promoting sin. In the Margaret legend associated with the thirteenth-century texts known as the Katherine Group, written for an audience of English female religious, the demon explains that he is especially devoted to encouraging sexual sins among women and men sworn to chastity.39 The complete narrative sequence of the life of St. Margaret—including both her encounter with the dragon and the less frequently portrayed defeat of the demon—opens up the full range of her potential signification.40 St. Catherine, like St. Margaret, was an Early Christian virgin martyr; she died for refusing the hand of Emperor Maxentius and his idol worship. Her connection with children came in the form of her association with nursing, because milk, rather than blood, flowed from her body when she was beheaded. The final scene on the cope shows both Catherine's martyrdom and two angels carrying her body to Mt. Sinai, which would remind viewers that Catherine was a myroblyte; the effusion of oil from her body gave her a special association with healing. For some medieval readers, Catherine's debate with the pagan philosophers bordered too closely on preaching, which was forbidden to women, and this element of her legend was increasingly edited out. Nevertheless, the Pienza Cope twice shows Catherine in a "preaching" pose, holding a book in her left hand while gesturing eloquently with the right. In the first scene of her narrative sequence, which is also the center panel of the lower arcade and the largest of all the panels on the cope, she addresses Emperor Maxentius and his court; she debates the philosophers in the following scene. Emblematically, St. Catherine is usually represented with her instrument of torment, the spiked wheels, but in this case, the full presentation of her narrative allows more than one aspect of her legend to receive attention. The stress on narrative in the Pienza Cope, as opposed to the hagiographie emblems or isolated scenes most common in medieval embroidery, seems partic ularly effective in making its images available to an array of readings. This raises questions regarding the relationship between image and narrative, how images may 152 Narrative Threads</page><page sequence="15">be read, and whether reading an image differs from reading a text. A pictorial sequence, like the three lives on the cope, might be read differently by the person wearing them than by the various types of viewers who might read the surface of a textual textile like the cope, but it is necessary to consider whether this kind of "reading" would operate in the same way as the reading of a text. Reading Images of Saints At the heart of hagiography is the story of the saint's life often gathered in collections such as Jacobus de Voragine's Legenda Aurea. However, whereas tex tually saints are presented in narrative form as the events of their lives are chrono logically presented, visually saints are most familiar in emblematic or non-narrative forms, as static figures bearing the sign or attribute that identifies them. Cynthia Hahn notes that, "the saint, in a seeming paradox, represents both stasis and progress."41 In stasis, as presented in an icon, a saint transcends time; she is a holy presence directly available to the viewer. The viewer may be aware of the events of the saint's life that have earned her that title, but this narrative is only alluded to in the image by means of the saint's emblem. Progress in this context takes the form of spiritual growth gained by viewers through their veneration of and connection to the saint.42 To present a saint in a pictorial narrative, as in historiated icons or other visual representations of scenes from a saint's life, is to show a different type of progress, one in which the viewer can follow the saint's progression through her earthly life as she moves toward spiritual perfection and final union with God. Rather than adopting a dialogic position in relation to the saint, as with an icon, the viewer or reader of a narrative takes the position of the saint herself, joining in the larger pattern of imitatio Christi in which all Christians—not only saints—participate. As Gregory of Tours observed, there is a single repeated hagiographie narrative—"the life of the saints"— founded in Christ.43 The holy life is a teleological progression that leads to redemp tion, but the narrative sequence itself is endlessly repeated, both in the lives of the saints and in those who venerate and strive to emulate them. In hagiographie art, then, a narrative is always implied, even if it is not explicitly presented. Significantly, many medieval discussions of images also concern narrative. The most authoritative and influential discussion of images in the West is found in Gregory the Great's two letters to Bishop Serenus of Marseilles (599, 600). In response to Serenus's destruction of images, Gregory reprimands him for not prop erly educating his flock in the correct use of images.44 He asserts that images in themselves are not evil, only occasionally misused; their true value lies in their didactic function. Gregory argues that a picture may be read by the illiterate just as Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 153</page><page sequence="16">a text is read: "For what writing offers to those who read it, a picture offers to the ignorant who look at it, since in it the ignorant see what they ought to follow, in it they read who do not know letters."45 Gregory explicitly ties images to narrative: "it is one thing to adore a picture, another through a picture's story to learn what must be adored."46 It appears that the destroyed pictures may have been pictorial narra tives, as suggested by Gregory's explanation of what Serenus's proper response should have been: "indicate that what displeased you was not the sight of the story revealed through the witness of a picture, but that adoration which had inappro priately been exhibited to the pictures."47 The value of the image lies in the story behind it, which can now be "read" by the illiterate.48 Gregory's letters served as a touchstone throughout the Middle Ages for dis cussions regarding the value and use of images.49 Closer to the time and place of the Pienza Cope, in the Middle English dialogue Dives and Pauper (1405), Gregory's arguments, along with other traditional iconophilic arguments, are cited in Pauper's defense of images during the discussion of the first commandment: Dives. Qherof [what purpose] seruyn thease ymagys? I wolde they weryn brent [burned] euerychon. Pauper. They seruyn of thre thynggys. For they been ordeynyd to steryn manys mend to thynkyn of Cristys incarnacioun and of his passioun and of holye seyntes lyuys. Also they been ordeynyd to steryn mannys affecioun and his herte to deucioun, for often man is more steryd be syghte than be heryng or redyngge. Also they been ordeynyd to been a tokene and a book to the lewyd peple, that they moun [may] redyn in ymagerye and peynture that clerkys redyn in boke."50 Pauper then tells the story of Bishop Serenus, who destroyed images just as Dives wants to, and was "accusyd to the Pope, Seynt Gregory, queche [who] blamyd hym gretly for that he hadde so dystroyid the ymagys."51 Pauper argues that the effect of images is threefold: they move the mind to contemplation of a narrative, move the heart to devotion, and thirdly, they act as a "tokene" (a sign) or a "book" for the unlettered. An image may bring to mind a narrative such as Christ's incarnation and Passion and the lives of the saints, or the narrative may be provided in pictorial form, as a textual narrative may be read in a book. Pauper agrees with Gregory that images are of great value to those who can not read, but he goes further by also asserting that they have a function beyond mere instruction, because they inspire an emotional response to the narrative, which texts do not.52 However, it is clear that images alone, especially non-narrative images, do not suffice for full comprehension. Following Pauper's argument that images function as books, Dives requests: "Sythin [since] ymagerye is but a tokene and a book to the 154 Narrative Threads</page><page sequence="17">lewyd peple, teche me yet a lytyl betere to knowe this tokene and to redyn this book."53 Pauper then explains the signs by which various holy figures may be known: Mary holds the Christ child and a lily; St. Peter holds keys. He also recounts the episodes of St. Catherine and St. Margaret's lives that are behind the familiar emblems of Catherine's wheel and Margaret's dragon.54 By providing the narratives that make some otherwise odd-looking images intelligible, Pauper turns these static, non-narrative images into texts. Ubiquitous as the emblems of saints were in the Middle Ages, there seems to have been concern about making sure that people knew the stories associated with familiar saints and their images. In the sermon for the feast of St. Margaret from his Festial (1380), John Mirk reminds parishioners that it is not enough simply to fast during the vigil of St. Margaret, but that they must also be sure to attend mass the next day. Then in order to "sture your deuocyon the more to thys holy maydyn," Mirk announces he will "schow yn parte of his [her] lyfe, and what scho suffyrde for Godys loue."55 He proceeds to tell a compressed version of the saint's life, pausing at the moment when Margaret defeats the demon and places her foot on his neck to explain, "Herfor Margret ys payntyd othur coruen [carved] wher scho ys wyth a dragon vndyr her fete and a cros yn her hond, schowyng how by uertu of the cros scho gate [gained] the victory of the fynde."56 Mirk's narrative of the life of St. Margaret serves to animate the static image that was already known to his audience. It is worth noting that Mirk uses the verb "show" to introduce his act of oral narration.57 For many of the preachers who used Mirk's sermon collection, it would be quite easy to "show" the congregation the life of Margaret by simply gesturing to the visual narrative painted on the wall. In medieval English wall paintings, much of which are contemporary with the Pienza Cope, narrative sequences from the life of Christ are very popular; Saints Margaret and Catherine are the two saints' lives most often painted (as opposed to emblematic representations).58 Imagining a con gregation visually following a narrative as the preacher read or retold the corre sponding text aloud offers the image of a medieval multi-media experience in which text and visual art interact. Although the auspicious moment when text and image converged might be only an annual occurrence, the permanent image on the church wall makes the narrative available even when the written text is not, reinforcing a sense of the importance of sacred narrative.59 Herbert Kessler has described this sort of cross referencing of text and image in Gregorian terms: "pictures were then 'Bibles of the unlettered' in the sense that they were reference books, books consulted either to recall to mind or to verify what was already known."60 However, what was "already known" might in fact be something not found in a text, as illustrated by the example Studies in Iconography 24 — 2003 155</page><page sequence="18">of St. Margaret and the dragon, in which images more consistently preserved the saint's emergence from the beast's belly than texts did. As Kessler observes, pic tures and not only texts might be considered valid sources for information about a subject: "pictures made permanent what was transitory in the oral reading, and, by their presence in the church, authorized an interpretation."61 The multiple media in which a narrative can be presented and the variations between those presentations open up a gap in which a variety of readings or interpretations may operate simul taneously. The lives of the Virgin Mary and Saints Margaret and Catherine as presented on the Pienza Cope were open to the multiple emphases and concerns of their viewers. Although ecclesiastical appropriation of the power of the three holy women is enacted by wearing their stories on the cope, their full range of signi fication, some of which was not endorsed by the Church, has not been entirely con tained, and may be even expanded by their presentation in pictorial narratives. As has been argued, narrative is always implied in hagiographie representa tions, whether in textual or visual form. Narrative is also an important element in the ritual function of vestments that cover a human form performing actions that are part of the larger narrative cycle of Christian redemption echoed in every mass, baptism, or church dedication. As a tract on the mass from Syon Abbey in England put it, "The processe of the masse representyd the verey processe of the Passyon off Chryst."62 In Middle English, "processe" is a synonym for narrative, which helps underscore the sense of movement encoded in the Church's rituals, whether the mass or a baptism, which also enacts a "processe" of Christ at the same time as it is part of the narrative of the congregation participating in it.63 A cope's specific function as a processional garment, something worn to mark the movement from one place to another, highlights even further the dynamic of narrativity. The Pienza Cope may be thought of as an early example of performance art. It is an event, unfolding in time and space, as light ripples across its gold surface and the movements of the wearer reveal and obscure different scenes. The practical func tion of a vestment complicates the reception of the images on it; unlike a visual narrative painted on a wall or a text written in a book, when it is being worn the full decorative program of a cope cannot be seen. Someone seeing the Pienza Cope from the left side would observe the Virgin and St. Margaret, while a viewer on the right would glimpse only the Virgin and St. Catherine. In contemplating the reception of the St. Martin embroideries, Margaret Freeman perceived the inherent difficulty raised by a narrative that covered a body, not a flat surface. In positing that the roundels depicting various episodes from the life of the saint were intended for an altar frontal and not a vestment, she confessed, "I prefer to imagine that [they] were arranged on a reasonably flat surface, not obscured by folds, so that each storied roundel could be 'read,' understood, and admired by all."64 156 Narrative Threads</page><page sequence="19">One may easily empathize with Freeman's viewpoint, especially as medieval embroidered vestments are now studied stretched out in museum cases or in highly detailed photographs that offer a vision that very few of the embroideries' con temporaries would have had (copes were stored folded in half or quarters in wooden cope chests). However, the way in which the images on a vestment would be per ceived by those observing it in use seems a more accurate reflection of how the images themselves functioned. The wearer's movements would cause different scenes to be highlighted or covered at different moments, providing an endless range of possibilities that would also vary depending on the location of the viewer. The wearer himself might glance down to see the Virgin's empty bier on his chest, or the martyrdom of St. Catherine as he stepped forward with his right foot, while a person at the back of the church might only be able to see the Coronation of the Virgin on the back of his neck. The scenes are all present, yet cannot always be perceived equally. Similarly, the multivalency of the hagiographie narratives presented may shift and bend with the concerns and needs of those who observed the Pienza Cope, whether they looked on as witnesses to its ritual appearance or stood enclosed within its golden circle.

Martini (Museo diocesano di Pienza, 62) dates the cope 1310-30, whereas Christie (English Medieval Embroidery) estimates the cope's date as 1325-50, and Donald King (Opus Anglicanum: English Medieval Embroidery [London: Arts Council, 1963], no. 54, pl. 11) says 1315-35. More recently scholars have suggested an earlier date; see Giuseppe Cantelli, "II piviale di Pio II," Con ferenze d'arte, ed. Gianni Mazzoni (Montepulciano: Editori del grifo, 1994), 69-84, who ties the cope's date to the Holkham Picture Book (1320-30).

Christie (English Medieval Embroidery, 180) notes that many of the pearls were still on the cope as late as 1884, when it was stolen; it turned up in Florence four days later, shorn of its pearls. 6. The cope was restored in 1995-7. For a meticulous account of its condition just prior, as well as remarkable photos of stitching details, see Maria Giorgi and Graziella Palei, "L'opus Anglicanum del Piviale di Pio II," OPD restauro 6 (1994): 212-23. Christie (English Medieval Embroidery, 9) dis cusses cope designs and concludes that the architectural framework is the most effective. 7. This motif stems from the belief that each apostle wrote one article of the Creed. For this concept in visual art, see Madeline H. Caviness, "Fifteenth-Century Stained Glass from the Chapel of Hampton Court, Herefordshire: The Apostles' Creed and Other Subjects," Walpole Society 42 (1968-70): 35-60, app. I and II, 57-60. My thanks to Miriam Gill for bringing this article to my attention. 8.1 am discussing extant examples. The cope listed in the 1369 Avignon inventory has the same deco rative scheme as the Pienza Cope (see n. 3 above). Whether or not this is the Pienza Cope, the point remains that this particular use of three narratives is unusual. 9.

This concept makes an unexpected appearance in the episode of Caradoc's mantle from Arthurian romance, in which the mantle is brought to Arthur's court with the announcement that it will only properly fit the woman who has no secrets from her husband; Caradoc's wife alone is virtuous enough to wear it. In a neat twist, the narrator of Thomas Gray's Scalachronica notes that the mantle was later made into a chasuble kept at Glastonbury: presumably the garment maintained its miraculous ability to discern virtue.

The Coronation of the Virgin, the most frequently occurring scene in opus anglicanum embroidery, is almost always placed at the top center of vestments.

Caviness notes that the Tree of Jesse topos, which fills the upper spandrels of the Pienza Cope between the two tiers of the Life of the Virgin, reminds the viewer of Christ's matri lineage and thus would be a suitable image for a female patron to sponsor. She discusses the image as positioning Mary at the top of the tree, but on the Pienza Cope the row of spandrels is sandwiched between the tiers of Mary's life, thus acknowledging the role of the male ancestors, but still placing them in a subordinate position to the Virgin's vita. See Caviness, "Anchoress, Abbess, and Queen: Donors and Patrons or Intercessors and Matrons?" in McCash, Cultural Patronage, 117, 129. 34.

The other three copes are the Toledo Cope (Christie, English Medieval Embroidery, pis. CIX CXI), the Vich Cope (pis. CXXII-III), and the Vatican Cope (pl. CXLIV). All four copes place the 160 Narrative Threads</page><page sequence="23">Coronation at the top center; all but the Vatican Cope also have the Nativity as the central panel of the middle arcade, although the Vatican Cope places the Crucifixion in that location and the Nativity in the center of the lower arcade. The Vich Cope shows the midwife in the center, but not holding the child as she does in the other three images. 36. Rozsika Parker, The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine (London: Women's Press, 1984), introduces another audience of "readers" into the picture: the opus anglicanum embroiderers (who would have been both women and men). Although her reading of childbirth themes is persuasive, she assumes that the presence of multivalent images indicates "a conflict between the interests of the ecclesiastic patrons and the craft workers" (50). Because laywomen as well as men were patrons of some opus anglicanum works, Parker's overly simplistic construction of the dominant Church versus laypeople is problematic. Because the patron and intended recipient of the Pienza Cope have not been documented, this article focuses on possible interpretations during its ritual use. 37.
