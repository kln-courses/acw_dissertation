WAUGH Abstract: In Historied Thought, Constructed World, Joseph Margolis identifies the philosophical themes that will dominate philosophical discussions in the twenty first century, given the recognition of the historicity of philosophical thought in the twentieth century. In what follows I examine these themes, especially cognitive intransparency, and the arguments presented in favor of them, noting the extent to which they rest on a view of language that takes a written text, and not speech, as the paradigm of language. I suggest if one takes speech as a mutual embodied action in a shared space as a model for language, the theme of cognitive intransparency—and the problems it brings in its wake—does not loom so large for those of us working in the history of philosophy. I conclude by showing that if we adopt this suggestion in relation to early Greek philosophy, that is, the period in the history of historied thought in which philosophy itself emerges as a linguistic and intellectual activity, we can better understand how and why philosophy emerged as it did—in the form of dialogues by Plato. Keywords: Joseph Margolis, history of philosophy, historiography of philosophy, cognitive intransparency, Greek philosophy, speech, texts. In Historied Thought, Constructed World, subtitled A Conceptual Primer for the Turn of Millennium (1995), Joseph Margolis presents his view of the philosophical work of the late twentieth century that will flourish in the twenty-first, and he even prophesies the directions in which future work will go. But he admits in the Preface that he wants "younger philosophers to believe spontaneously—and to be right in believ ing—that in introducing his primer as a prophecy ... [he has] somehow misrepresented it, that rather it convinces now" (1995, x). Whether one qualifies as a younger philosopher is relative, and, we might say, using Margolis's terminology, robustly so. For what it is worth, I think that in his primer Margolis is convincing as regards the dominance of nearly all of his master themes in the philosophy of our time and that of the not too distant future, themes that he identifies as symbiosis, historicity, Inten tionality, social construction, flux and intransparency. I am convinced that the "way of doing philosophy" he suggests in the primer—one governed by the postulate "Thinking is a history" (5, 301)—is a good way of doing philosophy now. I am particularly interested in the consequences © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="2">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 579 his themes have for the history of philosophy, especially early Greek philosophy. I agree with Margolis that "there cannot be a uniquely correct way of doing philosophy or any uniquely correct set of philoso phical theorems" (300) and that the themes he introduces could easily be implicated in arguments very different from the ones his primer favors. Doubtless there is no shortage of contemporary philosophers who agree with the master themes that Margolis has articulated and draw conclu sions different from his; this is just what philosophers do. But I confess that I do have some reservations about how he interprets these themes, or what he takes to follow from them, and I am uncertain about how to understand the theme of cognitive intransparency and whether this theme should be admitted. It does seem clear that at times Margolis and I prefer different metaphors in representing these master themes of the philosophy of our time, and more important, in structuring our knowledge of philosophy's—and thinking's—past.1 I am especially interested in how these metaphors affect how we may think about the history of philosophy—"the history of historied thought." 1. History, Philosophy, Writing Writing the "history of historied thought" is itself a complicated business, not least because of Margolis's claim that thinking not only has a history but is a history. To write the history of thinking, then, is in some sense to write a history of a history—a history of our reflections on how we conceptualize the past, how we know it, and what we know about it. But reflecting on our own ability to conceptualize—conceptualizing our ability to conceptualize—has been the very activity of philosophy, ever since the Greeks began to use philosophia to refer to our desire to think about ourselves and our world in order to understand them, and to the actions and ways of life that come from pursuing this desire. This continues to be an activity of philosophy even after the term is used to refer also to the discipline in which these activities have been professionalized and to the knowledge produced by this discipline. It may be that within the history of philosophy—especially in its recent history in the English-speaking world—the emphasis has been rather more on conceptualizing our ability to conceptualize and less on the desire to think about ourselves and our world for the purpose of understanding, and less, even, on the actions and ways of living that come from pursuing this desire. Still, to write a history of thinking is also to write a history of philosophy—and the history of philosophy is, in a fundamental sense, the history of thinking that is a history. It is difficult to see how contemporary 1 In speaking of our representations of our knowledge, past and present, I am following the suggestion by F. K. Ankersmidt (2000) that representations are proposals for how we structure our knowledge. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="3">580 JOANNE B. WAUGH philosophers, if pressed, could deny that thinking has—or is—a history. On the face of it, the thinking of any given individual has a history, and this history is part of our thinking, where "our" refers to the community— linguistic, social, political, and cultural—of which we are acknowledged members.2 And language is what we use to record and to participate in the history of thinking—or the thinking that is history—whether it belongs to individuals or to communities; indeed, another of the master themes of our time is the interdependence of thought, language, and social life. To the extent that we know anything about the history of human thinking that does not seem to be part of current thinking, we know it through documents. "History," Paul Veyne reminds us, "is knowledge through documents" (1984, 5). These documents as well as the practices of generating, preserving, and studying them are themselves historical practices. It cannot be the case, of course, that without documents there is no thinking; it is true that without writing there are no documents, but human communities—and human languages—existed long before some enterprising members of these societies came up with the "useful trick" of making marks on some substance—clay, rock, animal hides, or papy rus—to serve as signs for their speech.3 It may well be the case—in fact I would argue that it is the case—that the ability to record our thinking is a necessary condition of our being able to engage in sustained reflection on and conceptual analysis of how we know ourselves and our world,4 and on our past ways of thinking and analyzing. Reflecting on our own ability to know ourselves and our world—conceptualizing our ability to con ceptualize—is, of course, philosophy, and there is considerable evidence that the emergence of this activity in ancient Greece required the introduction of the Greek alphabet (Havelock 1963, 1978, 1982, 1986, and Robb 1984, 1994), although alphabetic writing was not by itself sufficient for philosophizing as we know it. Documenting through writing how, in the past, we have known and been ourselves and our world is, of course, history, and history, too, begins with the ancient Greeks. But writing is not our only way of representing the past, even if history is knowledge through documents. In nonliterate societies memory, if not history, is preserved through a tradition of embodied oral performance. Artifacts help us to "document" this memory, speaking metaphorically. Of course, to the extent that we know such societies, we must possess such artifacts, and the tradition of oral performance must still be practiced or must have left its mark on documents that came into existence when 2 I mean by "acknowledged members" here that each of us, as an individual, acknowl edges her or his membership in this community and that this membership is acknowledged also by the other members of the community. 3 The phrase "useful trick" comes from Eric Havelock, whose pioneering studies of the effect of literacy on the emergence of philosophy have had a great influence on my thinking about Greek philosophy in particular and philosophy in general (1982, 50). 4 See n. 5 below and Cole 1991, x. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="4">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 581 writing and reading were introduced as ways of preserving and transmit ting knowledge in that society. Such is the case with the oldest extant literature of Greek civilization—the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer.5 That we must depend on such traditions and documents in writing our own history and that of other people complicates our speaking both of history and of the history of human thinking. For with or without documents, thinking and the performance and activities that record it occur in a specific language, and the past is remembered and experienced and performed as a narrative. The history of philosophy as recently conceptualized and written tends to overlook the fact that our evidence for human thinking comes to us in performances and documents in a specific language, and that the past—our history of thinking—is remembered as a narrative. Indeed, it is only in the aftermath of the linguistic turn that philosophers have recognized the specificity and historicity of both our languages and our narratives about human thinking. And it is only in light of quite recent developments in philosophy that we are aware not only of the importance of writing to philosophy but also of the differences between speech and writing as linguistic activities. Whatever the dependence of thought on language and philosophy on writing, philosophers often overlook the fact that linguistic acts in specific natural languages are our best evidence of human thinking. Indeed, philosophers often take written texts rather than speech acts as the metaphor or paradigm of language and thought. Thus it is a dominant metaphor in the history of philosophy that thinking is somehow recorded in Reality, Mind, or Nature in a language that is accessible, if not to all, at least to certain philosophers.6 Thinking has consisted in the recollection of truths imprinted in the soul because of its previous experience of the Forms, or in the "natural light of reason" uncovering innate ideas in the soul, or in "reading" the "Book of Nature that is written in mathematics." The analogy between knowing and seeing goes back as far as Homer, of course, and Richard Rorty, following Dewey, suggests the essential feature of the Greek, especially the Platonic analogy, is the comparison between knowledge and perception, between "knowing a proposition to be true" and "being caused to do something by an object" (1979, 157-58). The object that the proposition is about "imposes the proposition's truth," and a necessary truth is the idea of a proposition we believe "because the 'grip' of the object upon us is ineluctable. Such a truth is necessary in the sense in which it is sometimes necessary to believe that what is before our eyes looks red—there is a 5 This claim is most identified with Parry 1971. For more recent discussion of Homer in the wake of Parry's groundbreaking work, see Nagy 1996 and McAuslan and Walcot 1998. 6 This point is inspired, of course, by Derrida's observations about the extent to which the notion of speech is parasitic on the idea of writing or inscription. See, for example, Derrida 1976 and 1981. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="5">582 JOANNE B. WAUGH power, not ourselves, which compels us. The objects of mathematical truths will not let themselves be misjudged or misreported. Such para digmatically necessary truths as the axioms of geometry are supposed to have no need of justification, of argument, of discussion—they are as undiscussable as the command of Zeus shaking the lightning, or of Helen beckoning to her bed" (158). Rorty goes on to suggest that "putatively rational ananke is, so to speak, just a sublimated form of brute biaBut for the ancient Greeks who saw speech as part of reality, a part of phusis, what could such a distinction mean? If words are as real—and as natural—as objects and can do things and make things happen, and if nature, too, is alive and intelligent and, perhaps, deathless and divine, then the move from thought to talk to thing is not a difficult one.7 For the early Greeks, language naturally maps what is real and is sufficiently transparent neither to impede nor to facilitate the exchange of ideas, passions, or desires (cf. Cole 1991, x). Mortals can achieve "true communication or authentic contact" with what is shining, radiant, and divine through muthos. For, as Hesiod tells us, the Muses breathe into the poet the power to sing "what is, what was before now, and what will be" (Theogony, 32, 38), and through this song poet and audience connect to what is beyond their own experience. The singer is granted "divinatory omniscience" or second sight (Detienne 1996, 42^43) as he sings of what is thauma ides thai, a wonder to behold.8 The impression of eyewitness immediacy makes the poet "master of truth" because he sees so clearly what is normally invisible to mortals (cf. Cole 1991, 38). As the invisible becomes visible, mortals experience the plenitude of existence that attests to the truth of muthos. The human body includes organic realities and vital forces and psychic activities and divine inspirations or influxes, and its vocabulary, as Jean-Pierre Vernant emphasizes, connotes equally the relation one has to others to whom he is "bound" by his forms of bodily appearance, including face, size, bearing, voice, and gestures (1991, 28-29, 31). Mortals are bound to the divine by their bodies because mortals conceive of themselves in contrast to the "corporeal plenitude," the "super-body of the gods" and their "radiant, constant existence" (1991, 31). Nature and 7 Kennedy 1989b, 78; Cole 1991, x; and Detienne 1996, 72ff. Cole observes that prior to Plato Greek literature is primarily "arhetorical": meaning and media are considered to be inextricably intertwined, and until such time as speakers and audiences are capable of habitually "abstracting" the essential or "informative core" from the extra- or non informative (that is, rhetorical) elements of "verbal contexts," language is basically "transparent" (x). 8 Cf. Segal (1995, 184-85), who observes that the Homeric warrior's power "is conceived visually: he is surrounded by the radiance of bright metal, conspicuous by the terrible crest and plumes of his helmet, and often seen in rapid and powerful emotion that invites comparison with striking visual phenomena of nature, like large animals, birds of prey, fire lightning in the sky." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="6">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 583 bodies are not brute, nor is their hold on us the consequence of mere force (.bia). The plentitude of existence is a sign of its normative force, that is, rational ananke. 2. Nature, Spectacle, Spectators The muthos that the ancient audience hears in performance is not the text read by their modern counterparts, for once Descartes turns us into rational spectators in and of brute matter, language is no longer wholly a part of phusis at the same time as it is intelligent and, perhaps, divine. Communica tion through and with nature no longer happens; language may convey what we know about nature, but language, as opposed to mere sounds and marks, belongs to res cogitans and not to res extensa. It will be centuries before philosophers again consider speech a part of phusis or see human acts of speaking and thinking as part of nature. Indeed, it is not clear that contemporary philosophers have yet to come to terms with what it means for words to be as real—and as natural—as objects, for words to do things and make things happen. And it is nearly impossible to believe that Western philosophers will ever again believe that nature, too, is alive and intelligent and, perhaps, deathless and divine. Once the nonhuman reality that exists besides us is regarded not as a Thinking, Speaking Being (as the archaic Greeks seem to have held) but as brute matter, it is possible for us as conscious subjects to know it—provided that it is intelligible—as spectators and through representations. Since Descartes retains the medieval notion that nature is the creation of a Thinking, Speaking Being, the ontological and epistemological gulf established by his distinction between subjects who think and speak and objects that do neither is bridged by our representations. What we "read off' from Nature is more or less veridical, because it is God's creation. God is the author, as it were, of the "Book of Nature," and we are the readers of the "One True Vocabulary" inscribed "out there" in the natural world. Language conveys these representations by painting a verbal picture of what we see as spectators; language is thus a thing we look at or we hear, and it matters little whether it is language spoken or language read. As modern commitments to what is "natural"—and opposition to the "supernatural" having such a prominent epistemological role—grow stronger, Descartes' conclusion comes to be seen as the product of faith rather than reason. The gulf between subjects that think and talk and objects that do neither thus becomes impossible to cross as the "space of reasons" (Sellars 1963, 169) is internalized, withdrawn from the external world, indeed, "deformed," as John MacDowell puts it (1975, 877). For the space of reasons turns out to be only the "space" found in a mirror. If our thoughts and our talk describe images that are in the mind and of objects in the "external world," images that represent these objects with the accuracy—or inaccuracy—of a mirror, what is missing in these reflections is, as Hume insists, any necessary order among these objects, © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="7">584 JOANNE B. WAUGH and any account of or reason why and where it exists, or what causes it. The problem becomes one of explaining the intelligibility of these objects that are neither themselves intelligent nor the creation of a Thinking, Speaking, and Intelligent Being. Thoughts and talk—judgments and reason—are nonnatural entities belonging on the subjective side of this ontological and epistemological divide between subjects and objects, while those things that we seek to understand—including other "sub jects" and the "external world"—are on the natural, objective side. With Kant's "Copernican revolution," the intelligibility of our experi ence of what is "out there" is no longer thought to be something abstracted from the representations that make up our sensible experience. Rather, our sensible experience of what is "out there" is organized according to a priori forms of judgments that render it something about which we can talk or think, and thus are we able to make judgments about objects "out there." Thus is there an object about which we can make empirical statements.9 These a priori forms that judgments and experi ence must take are inscribed, as it were, in the subject. Whatever necessity any necessary truths have thus comes not from an object "out there" that the proposition is about, not from an object that has an ineluctable "grip" on us, not from an object that is a power other than ourselves that compels us to believe these truths as we believe that what is before our eyes looks red. What imposes necessary truths on us is, indeed, a part of ourselves, for, to be known, whatever exists besides us must come under the control of the subject and be brought under concepts. The "natural world" is thus a product of the subject that is different— somehow—from it, and our statements or judgments about it are no longer copies or images of what was "out there," although they concern its appearances. There is no object "out there" with which to compare our representations; indeed, the thing-in-itself—the noumenon—is not an object of knowledge. Neither is the subject that imposes this necessary intelligibility on objects itself an object of knowledge; it is a "transcen dental" and not an empirical subject, one that produces the empirical subject and its objects of knowledge through a synthesis of understand ing, sensibility, and imagination. Although we do not have knowledge of the transcendental subject, we are aware of the noumenal self when we formulate the moral law and bind ourselves to it. The noumenal self may also be expressed, though only in a regulative and teleological sense, in history, culture, and religion. 9 It is important to note, as does Michael Friedman (2000, 27) that "for Kant, we cannot explain how the object of knowledge becomes possible on the basis of the a priori logical structures of judgment alone. We need additional a priori structures that mediate between the pure forms of judgment and . . . the unconceptualized manifold of impressions supplied by the senses . . . the pure forms of sensible intuition, space and time." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="8">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 585 Philosophers since Kant have rarely philosophized without concern for what he said, and, indeed, it is post-Kantian philosophy that leads to what Margolis regards as the master themes of contemporary philosophy. Eschewing Kant's distinction between noumena and phenomena,10 post Kantian idealism unites the functions of the transcendental subject and the noumenal self—imposing intelligibility on the sensible world, acting as a moral subject, and expressing the telos of history, culture, and religion—in its reconceptualization of external nature as unified with spirit. Thus Hegel offers a version of what Margolis labels "symbiosis," the claim that "there is no principled epistemic disjunction between an independent actual world and the world we experience and claim to know" (1995, 57).u But the intelligibility of nature and spirit is underwritten once again by structures of consciousness that belong to the knowing subject, although knowledge is only attainable by the subject through its experience of nature—and other subjects—in history. This emphasis on the temporal unfolding of human thought gives rise, of course, to Margolis's theme of historicity, the fact that "thinking has a history, in the sense of any and all of its manifestations (in logic, science, conversation, critique, action) are artifacts of the historically changing conditions of actual human life" (1995, 300). But Hegel complicates, if not compromises, the historicity of thinking by identifying the telos of history as the Absolute's becoming conscious of itself. Either the necessity and rationality of intelligible experience is presupposed as implicit in the structures of consciousness that unfold historically toward a telos, or the conscious experience of the world reflected in human thought is unaccountably governed by an unknown necessity so as to be or become rational. Thus is interpretation required, because the structures of rationality in history do not announce themselves to us, nor are they "pictured in representations." Rather, history—and philosophy, for Hegel—is hermeneutical; we must read the past, indeed, interpret the book of the past, as theologians have inter 10 It seems fair to say with Friedman that post-Kantian German Idealism favored the noumenal self as pure practical reason, and the regulative and teleological functions of reason, over the science-preserving functions of the transcendental subject. Cf. Friedman 2000, 145-46. Margolis reminds us that in distinguishing the phenomenal from the noumenal world and in assigning the intelligibility and necessity of our phenomenal experience to the transcendental subject, Kant claims more knowledge of the noumena than he has a right to on his own account: "It is true that Kant construes the phenomenal world (to which we are cognitively confined) as a 'construction', which . .. depends on the joint work of our understanding and whatever we passively receive from the independent world. This theory ... is ultimately inconsistent, since although we are thus confined, Kant is (somehow) able to determine what the a priori contribution of our subjective understanding is" (1995, 308, n. 7). '' Margolis notes that Kant is not committed to symbiosis, because "he does think of the external relation between subject and world as itself originally posited within some prior holist space" (1995, 58). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="9">586 JOANNE B. WAUGH preted the Scriptures. To the extent that Hegel is read as an Absolute Idealist, he has not let go of transcendentalism.12 What Hegel has done, as Margolis rightly emphasizes, is to announce the theme of Intentionality: the claim that "the human world—human persons and what they do and produce—is a real world, the distinc tive phenomena of which are marked by possessing structures of significance complexly embedded in their physical properties" (1995, 300). Once Intentionality is combined with symbiosis and with historicity, the problem is no longer one of establishing the reality of the human world. The problem, rather, is one of conceptualizing the natural world in a way that permits natural scientific inquiry as conceived by the "New Science." The legacy of German Idealism for the Neo-Kantians is just this problem of explaining the relation of the human world to the natural world—as well as the relation of the human sciences and natural sciences—the Geisteswissenschaften and the Naturwissenschaften. The Neo-Kantians, though denying the notion of pure sensibility and the rest of Kant's faculty psychology, return to a Kantian view of science as made possible by the application of the formal logical structures, located in human understanding, to concrete objects. Without the application of formal logical structures providing for the necessity and rationality of intelligible experience, there are only the contingencies of experience. That this emphasis on the logical contribution continued the tradition of transcendentalism is not a particular problem for the neo-Kantians or for Carnap and the early Logical Positivists and Logical Empiricists, who, as Michael Friedman (2000) has documented, share an educational legacy and intellectual tradition with the Neo-Kantians. The advances in conceptualizing logic as a formal language in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth encourage the project of identifying the logical contribution to scientific knowledge, as does the success of physics. Physics had, of course, featured prominently in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century epistemology, and by the first quarter of the twentieth century the success of physics makes it not merely adequate but exemplary for the business of understanding both ourselves and our world. "So it goes," Hayden White has observed, "in most theoretical discussions: any given field of knowledge must presuppose the adequacy of the practices of at least one other field in order to get on with its business" (1999, 24). As physics becomes the paradigm for science, so does the logical structure of science become the paradigm for knowledge for the Logical Empiricists. Thus does science become the paradigm for philosophy in North America when many of the 12 Margolis points out that if Hegel is read as an Absolute Idealist, that is, as one whose "historicism is internal to a larger teleologism addressed to the universe," then he is incoherent, for "under no circumstances can an historicized or horizoned understanding confront the universe or confront it in a cognitively competent way" (1995, 187). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="10">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 587 Logical Positivists and Logical Empiricists, among them Carnap, Kraft, Reichenbach, Feigl, and Nagel, flee to the English-speaking countries to escape the impending Nazi domination of Continental Europe. 3. Natural Science, Natural Language, Naturalism: The Linguistic Turn With Logical Empiricism comes the "linguistic turn," which though less grand sounding than the "Copernican revolution" is nearly as significant. But for the Logical Empiricists the language of the linguistic turn is a formal, rather than a natural, language. Natural languages develop historically over a long period of time, and linguistic use precedes the formulation of grammar; such languages are orally transmitted and socially learned as part of living in a linguistic community. The grammar of formal languages, in contrast, is defined prior to use, and such languages are learned and transmitted through written symbols. Although Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus is a primary impetus for the Logical Positivists, Wittgenstein does not count himself among them, and the formal character of the linguistic turn in its early stages is both prompted and enhanced by the scientism of Logical Positivism and its hoped-for unity of science.13 Certainly this scientism is decisive in the subsequent division of Western philosophers into the analytic and the Continental traditions. Given Wittgenstein's emphasis on natural rather than formal language in the Philosophical Investigations, it is tempting to speculate that had the Investigations been published earlier rather than later in the linguistic turn, the split between analytic and Continental philosophy would not have occurred as it did—or would not have occurred with the same vehemence. Certainly Heidegger displays an interest in natural language—as well as an opposition to symbolic logic and scientism—in his early work, and there is no shortage of contemporary scholarship devoted to the similarities between Wittgen stein and Derrida, or Heidegger and Davidson, or Davidson and Derrida. As it was, the attention that analytic philosophers in England paid to natural language after their exposure to the later Wittgenstein had the effect of making the character of analytic philosophy in England rather different from that in the United States. And until quite recently, the commitment to scientism in American analytic philosophy has not only perpetuated its enthusiasm for the study of formal languages but also limited the ways in which many American philosophers have conceived of the functions and significance of natural language.14 13 Indeed, even in the Tractatus Wittgenstein's interest in formal languages seemed to be prompted as much, if not more, by a desire to understand the relation between logic and natural languages as by the commitment to the kind of scientism found among the Logical Positivists. 14 Michael Dummett observes that the question posed by his article "Can Analytical Philosophy Be Systematic and Ought It to Be?" would be a ridiculous question to pose to © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="11">588 JOANNE B WAUGH The scientism espoused by the Logical Positivists is not to be confused with naturalism, although naturalism does come to be identified with scientism in American philosophy, a fact that contributes to how American analytic philosophers thought about natural language.15 But the early Logical Positivists, including Carnap, are not naturalists, and their focus on formal rather than natural languages tended to reinforce the notion that language is merely an instrument for science, one that is neutral and transparent. Of course, philosophers and scientists had long held that language is merely a tool for doing science, a view nicely summarized by Roland Barthes: [F]or science, language is merely an instrument which it chooses to make as transparent, as neutral, as possible, subjugated to scientific matters (opera tions, hypotheses, results) which are said to exist outside it and to precede it: on the one side, and first of all, the contents of the scientific messages, which are everything: and on the other side and afterwards, the verbal form entrusted with expressing these contents, which is nothing. (1989, 4) On this view, language as an instrument for doing scientific work and for conveying its results should affect neither the results nor the work that produced them. And it is the failure on the part of philosophers of science to construct successfully a neutral observation language, that is, the kind of neutral scientific instrument their view of science requires, that under mines the project of Logical Empiricism. Equally important, of course, is the work of historians and philosophers of science that shows that in carrying out the activities of science—and philosophy and history, for that matter—with and through natural languages as well as formal ones, we cannot limit interpretation in science to assigning natural-language sentences to well-formed formulae. Philosophers come to recognize that natural language's role in scientific inquiry is more substantial than, and different from, painting a verbal picture of what we see as spectators. Philosophers thus discover, as Barthes puts it, that "language is the very being not only of literature, but also science, its very world" (1989, 4). Just as words are what enable us to experience literature, language is what enables us to do science. Carnap, or to those American philosophers who tend to regard philosophy as "at least cognate with the natural sciences" (1978, 437-38). Dummett notes that there was divergence between the analytic tradition as practiced in the United States and in the United Kingdom, but that in the mid-1970s British philosophy became aligned with the American school (441). 15 Despite the ubiquity of the term naturalism and its dominance as a theme in recent American philosophy, it is not an easy term to define, as will be discussed below. Here I use the term as Joseph Rouse does: "Naturalism in the broadest sense is the claim that philosophical reflection should be continuous with (or perhaps a part of) empirical science" (2002, 1). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="12">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 589 This is not to deny, of course, there is something other than or independent of humans; it is, rather, to underscore that for us brute reality is, well, brute: it does not speak or think. Science may posit as objects of investigation nonhuman events that occur independently of what we say or think about them, but from the fact that we posit objects and events as occurring independently of what we say about them it does not follow that science is not something we do, any more than the fact that we may find a text that we did not write existing independently of us means that what we read is not a human artifact. Nor in saying that language is the "very being of science" should we understand "language" in representational terms, that is, as merely describing what exists independently of us. Science is not merely language, and language is not merely describing, and we are not merely spectators looking out at the world. Rather, using language in doing science is an action or series of actions, actions that are embodied and material and as such are ways of intervening and interacting with whatever exists besides us. That the historicity of science has not always been recognized as a central fact about science seems to result from or to be reinforced by— it is not altogether clear which is cause and which is consequence—a spectator theory of knowledge and its concomitant representational view of language.17 As something we do—and do with natural language— science is part of thinking that is history or has a history, even if the objects posited by science are not—or not always—part of that history.18 Science, like any other manifestation of human thinking, is not merely an artifact of the historically changing conditions of actual human life. Science is also part of the real human world, the distinctive phenomena of which possess structures of significance embedded in their physical properties—even when scientific thinking is characterized by its attempt to confine its thinking to the physical properties of the objects it studies. Whatever exists besides humans—the physical world—does not speak. Our experience of this world is "always already" an interaction between us and whatever exists besides us, and to the extent this is a linguistic interaction, one must add social construction to the themes of symbiosis and Intentionality. "Human persons, linguistically and cognitively apt 16 But to the extent that the objects of investigation posited by physics are nonhuman events—instances of heat and light and motion that occur independently of what we say or think about them—taking these objects as paradigmatic for knowledge does not provide much in the way of understanding when we turn to objects and events that do not occur independently of what we say or do: objects and events in which what we say and think effects what happens—human objects and events or events and objects that result from thinking and talking abut our interactions with whatever exists besides us. 17 The expression "spectator theory of knowledge" is usually credited to Dewey (1948). 18 Of course science may also take as its objects our interactions with whatever exists besides us, as well as human events, events that do not occur independently of what we say or do, events in which what we say and think effects what happens. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="13">590 JOANNE B. WAUGH selves, are themselves formed, empowered and emergent only in virtue of having internalized and shared the collective practices of a viable society" (Margolis 1995, 300).19 Although we speak of science as a manifestation of human thinking, a human artifact, the languages we use in doing science include languages that are historically and culturally specific. A historically and culturally specific—that is, a natural—language is, to be sure, a human language, but while there are many human languages, there is no human language —that is, a language spoken by all humans at all times. The performances and documents that count as evidence for scientific thinking and the history of scientific thinking also occur in a language of a particular linguistic community, and, as Wittgenstein showed in Philosophical Investigations, it is the forms of life or social practices of a community of speakers that enable, preserve, and elaborate their language. It is Wittgenstein's insistence on the primacy of the social in explaining natural language that is captured in the theme of social construction. The admission of historically and culturally specific languages in doing science and the primacy of the social in natural languages undermine the Positivist notion that in analyzing the logical structure of science philosophy provides a ground for the sciences. Given the commitment to scientism in American analytic philosophy, the solution appears to be naturalism, which requires that the relation between philosophy and empirical science be reconceptualized. Thus Quine's recommendation (or at least one of Quine's recommendations) that science absorb philosophy or, alternatively, that the web of empirical beliefs provide whatever grounding there is for philosophy.20 But naturalism, as Joseph Rouse reminds us, can be a metaphilosophical thesis about philosophy, or a metaphysical thesis within philosophy.21 The first amounts to a commit 19 Social construction, as Margolis describes it, seems to be rather different from what Ian Hacking (1999) describes as social construction. 20 See the observation by Haack (1993) that naturalism needs to be disambiguated, and her discussion of at least two Quinean versions of naturalism. 21 Rouse (2002, 2) also speaks of disambiguating naturalism. More often than not, naturalism as a thesis about philosophy is more specifically a thesis about epistemology, and the relevant scientific work is taken to be natural-scientific studies of cognition. To the extent that naturalism is expansionist, to borrow Haack's terminology, it takes epistemology to include natural-scientific studies of cognition, or to be "the philosophical component of a joint enterprise with the sciences of cognition" (1993, 118). It is hard to imagine that many philosophers would find this version of naturalism particularly objectionable. But views about the relations between epistemology and natural-scientific studies of cognition often take more restrictive forms: reformist (scientistic) naturalism holds that traditional episte mological problems "can be resolved by the natural-scientific studies of cognition"; revolutionary (scientistic) naturalism holds that these traditional problems should be abandoned and/or replaced by natural-scientific questions about cognition (119). But to reject apriorism in epistemology need not take the form of a commitment to scientistic naturalism, although this tends, not surprisingly, to be the view of many philosophers of science. Haack's version of reformist a posteriori naturalism acknowledges that traditional © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="14">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 591 ment that philosophy should be continuous with, or dependent upon, the best work of the natural sciences. The second is a claim about the relation between "the domain of natural facts... disclosed within the sciences, and some other domains (psychological, semantic, epistemic, social, or moral) within which allegedly true claims or binding obligations can be expressed" (20 02, 2).22 Philosophers who are metaphilosophical natural ists must defer to science, those who are metaphysical naturalists are accountable to nature; these are not mutually exclusive alternatives, as Rouse notes, for one may be able to offer a naturalistic account of how "the scientific disclosure of nature is itself 'natural'" (2002, 3). An account of how science is practiced by "natural beings" would seem to require an understanding of naturalism that includes the idea that using natural language is, well, natural. But the dominant under standing of "naturalism," as Margolis observes, is "any explanatory account that is (i) causal in structure or governed by considerations of causal explanation alone, or is otherwise confined to first-order (usually physical) resources (whether by obviating or by reducing legitimating matters) and (ii) specifically precludes rationalizations or explanations that are not causal in structure or not governed by the requirements of causal explanation" (1995, 96). As long as causality is seen as belonging to the anormative natural world and normative explanations as belonging to the social world, naturalism will seem at odds with an account of "natural beings" using natural language to do science. If we accept Wittgenstein's point that the forms of life or social practices that enable, preserve, and elaborate a language evince norms, and that consequently there is no need to appeal to any transcendental subject to account for normativity, the Hegelian concepts of historicity, symbiosis, and Intentionality recommend themselves (minus, of course, any Hegelian presuppositions regarding Absolute Idealism, transcendentalism, or apriorism). The admission of these themes is, of course, incompatible with the dominant conception of naturalism, and thus must it be reconceptualized or abandoned. 4. Bodies and the Primacy of the Social We begin with the fact that speaking and thinking are interdependent activities and neither activity is reducible to the other, because, as epistemological problems "can be resolved aposteriori, within the web of empirical belief' (118), but the web of empirical belief includes, in addition to natural science, common sense, history, logic, mathematics, and philosophy (123). Haack's naturalism, then, is a theory about philosophy, and in particular epistemology, and its relation to science, but "science" here is understood in the sense of the web of empirical beliefs, not as limited to the natural sciences. 22 Nonetheless, metaphysical naturalists, as Rouse observes, may have strong disagree ments as to whether the relation between the natural and the normative should be construed as reduction, supervenience, elimination, or "predictive enhancement" (2002, 2, n. 2). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="15">592 JOANNE B. WAUGH Davidson puts it in his characteristically oracular way, "thought itself is essentially social" (1993, 606), since meaning is a function of mutual actions. And thought itself is essentially social, whether it is thought about physical objects or events that result from our interactions with whatever exists besides us, or thought about human artifacts and events. The primacy of the social in the activity of thinking—and the theme that thinking is a history—should not be understood in the manner of, say, Piaget, or of the structuralists who hold that social interaction is necessary for the realization of structures or stages of thought that are ahistorical in the sense of being universal. We think in and with a specific language—or specific languages—and not in "human language." Despite philosophy's habit of presuming universal structures to ensure the possibility of communication between disembodied, solipsistic, Cartesian subjects, the social character of thought—and language—is sufficient to attest to such communication. But one need be neither a linguistic determinist nor a linguistic relativist to admit that thought or statements in one language do not always translate completely or without difficulty into another. That our evidence for human languages and our narratives about human thinking are found in the performances and documents of speakers of specific languages means that we must start by recognizing the specificity and historicity of both our thinking and our narratives, unless or until we have compelling evidence to the contrary. That philosophers traditionally prefer invariance to flux is not reason enough for us to overlook that once we admit the social character of language and thought, there is no compelling argument "for de re necessities and necessary invariances in the world," or for "prior de dicto necessities ranging over the terms and sentences by which we interpret the world" (Margolis 1995, 300). This is Margolis's theme of flux. But neither should we take the social character of the thought and language of a given community as indicative of conceptual schemes, at least some of which are incommensurable with others, or with the notion that the world is cognitively intransparent and thus requires interpreta tion. As our point of departure is "always already" an interaction—or intra-action—between us and whatever exists besides us, it is not clear that we could separate "scheme from content" or, as Davidson (1986) observes, why any evidence we might adduce for incommensurable conceptual schemes should not be regarded as evidence against them. That contemporary philosophy must acknowledge historicity, symbiosis, Intentionality, flux, and social construction is hard to dispute, but this may not be true of cognitive intransparency. Transparency—or intransparency—makes sense as a metaphorical description of our relation to the world on a representationalist account of semantics and epistemology of the sort found in the spectator theory of Locke and Hume, but this is not the sense in which Margolis is using the © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="16">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 593 term. Rather, he seems to regard what is transparent as what does not require interpretation, and anything that requires interpretation as not cognitively transparent. Margolis suggests that "the world (or a world) is a text (or is 'texted')" (1995, 75), by which he means that in interacting with whatever exists besides us, we "interpret" the world according to a conceptual scheme, and that thus interpreted, the world is a text apt for further "interpretation." Thus he concludes that "texts are the contexts of other texts" (76). As "texted," then, the world is intransparent. Margolis also speaks of cognitive intransparency in rela tion to holism: "[B]y interpretative tertia (the term is introduced by Rorty, and shared, at least implicitly by Davidson)... I [Margolis] mean (i) alternative categorical schemes by which the holism (the intranspar ency) of our symbiotized world is parsed in such a way as to permit constative acts or truth-claims, or (ii) schemes that mediate, as such, what are linked within the truth relation itself" (79, emphasis in original). At the conclusion of his primer, he says that intransparency means "there is no significant claim about the way the world is that is incontestably true, known to be true for a certainty, or self-evidently true in any way" (300). It is not clear that we need any claim about the world "to be true for a certainty, or self-evidently true in any way," and in this sense intransparency may not constitute a problem. We do need, to echo Davidson and Rorty, to make our way in the world, and we call those sentences that enable us to do this true. These sentences are true because of their relationship to other sentences; they appear in inferences that describe explicitly what we do in the practices that enable us to make our way in the world. But that practices enable us to make our way in the world—that some sentences are true—can also depend on whatever exists besides us, and on the ease or recalcitrance that char acterizes our interactions with it as embodied creatures in a shared space. To say that whatever exists besides us can "invalidate," as it were, what we say about it, need not commit us to representationalism or to a spectator theory of knowledge. What has been neglected if not entirely missing in most accounts of our making our way in the world is the role of the body in social practices, including linguistic ones. Indeed, the social character of thought and language is a function of embodied speakers sharing an environment and a history of communication. Davidson provides a sketch of a minimal social situation in "The Third Man" (1993) to exhibit the social character of thought and how this ensures that we possess the idea of an (objective) world. He assumes, of course, that the speakers of a language have bodies, but he does not emphasize the role of embodiment in communication. Davidson begins with the observation that the "proverbial child" or other animal that lacks languages has brains and sense organs "organized to pick out objects from © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="17">594 JOANNE B. WAUGH their backgrounds" (1993, 608).23 However, the power to discriminate does not imply possession of a concept: "[SJensory discrimination classifies phenomena as they differ at the periphery of the nervous system; concepts classify in terms of properties that may or may not stir the senses at the moment" (608). Responding reliably to red things is not the same as being aware of them as red, and therefore as colored, or easily seen in daylight, for to be aware of something as red requires that we master the use of the concept—to be able to use the sentence "this is red" as a premise or conclusion in an inference. And mastering a concept means not just using a sentence in the right circumstances but also eliciting the correct response from another speaker. In Davidson's minimal situation, embodied speakers are present in a shared space that allows them to "corroborate" that each is experiencing the events and objects the other is experiencing (1993, 608). The correla tion of responses by two or more creatures "triangulate an object" and permit it to be seen as the common cause of the responses, located in a shared interpersonal space (609). The corroboration of the other allows each to believe that his or her response is not an idiosyncratic occurrence but would be the response of anyone like them who occupied that space. With such concepts and judgments as "this is edible," "that is poison ous," and "here is a lion" comes the belief in an objective world, a world independent of us (608). What we share in this interpersonal space makes knowledge and language possible, for it gives us confidence that each is sensing what the other is—or can—sense, and introduces the possibility of "occasional failures of expected joint reactions and hence of error" (609). Language thus allows us to go beyond what we sense jointly and immediately, to talk and think about what is not present: "[T]he experiences we register as communal tie our words and thoughts to the world" (610). But the sensory discrimination that allows us to pick out objects from their backgrounds and the correlation of responses by which two or more creatures triangulate the object, and thus permit it to be seen as the common cause of the responses, are, Rouse argues, actions entailing practical competence in our surroundings. Perception and actions are achievements that enable us to be reliable reporters; the practical skills involved in reliable noninferential reporting and practical competences are skills that are in the public domain and open to normative correction (2002, 212). Acquiring these skills is a matter of communicative interac tion and learning. Moreover, as Rouse notes in such cases as "You're not listening to me" and "Keep your eye on the ball," "perceptual activity is publicly corrigible independent of the assessment of explicit observation reports" (214). The skills in question here are not implicit perceptual and 23 This is part, I think, of what Margolis means in saying that our cognizing powers and the cognized features of the world must be adequated to one another (1995, 225). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="18">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 595 motor skills but practical corrigible skills; perceiving involves corporally active, publicly recognizable comportments judged on grounds of prac tical success or failure (2002, 214). Thus is language possible because we are intelligent embodied creatures, not disembodied Cartesian subjects who must find a way of expressing their already intelligible selves to other such subjects, or of explaining —and justifying—the apparent interactions among our minds, bodies, and other objects occupying space. Communication with the other, including and especially initial prelinguistic communication—that is, correlating responses with others in a shared space—results from the exchange of not only sounds but also expressions, stances, gestures, and movements, or the lack thereof. The actions of intelligent embodied creatures are the necessary condition for proceeding into language and acquiring concepts—it is tempting to say that we communicate —bodily—into language, if by "language" we mean something we abstract and systematize from our communicative acts. This capacity for symbolic actions and meaningful statements is part of what we are and do: gesturing, miming, drawing, painting, dancing, acting, talking, and telling stories.24 They cannot be reduced to some other more fundamental or primitive capacity. This does not require us to admit into our ontology some category of immaterial or supernatural existence, but it does demand that our idea of material or natural things be robust enough to include knowing how to do things that enable communica tion—making sounds, gestures, faces, and movements that we interpret as meaningful. Just as we speak of knowing how to walk, gesture, dance, or ride a bicycle, and mean that this knowledge is stored in the muscles, nerves, and joints of the body as well as the brain, we can say that knowing how to communicate—how to speak a language—is embodied in its speakers.25 Thus do we erase the boundary between knowing a language and knowing how to make our way in the world. We might say, invoking Foucault, that this knowledge of how to make one's way in the world—knowledge of how to speak a language—is written on the body, but this metaphor where body stands in place of text should be turned around, for inscribing language on some object—generating a document—imitates the way in which language—and knowledge—are in the body. The text or document is a metaphor for the body, and not the other way around. The embodied speaker is not imitating the text or document; rather, the text stands in for a speaker. 24 Margolis refers to these practices as linguistic or "lingual," that is, linguistically informed but not specifically linguistic (1995, 49). 25 It is, perhaps, significant that Margolis uses the term incarnation to describe how the Intentional or the cultural is real and in physical things (1995, 217ff.) © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="19">596 JOANNE B. WAUGH If we understand a text as a metaphor for the body, it may change how we think about texts—as well as how we think about the world and bodies in the world. If the text is a metaphor for an embodied speaker "always already" in a context, then it might be better to see our (social) interaction26 with whatever exists besides us on the model of embodied speakers triangulating objects in their shared space, and not on that of a solitary reader confronting a text that is standing in for an absent— embodied—speaker. The problem with texts is not their opacity but the opacity of the context. We need to recover "the logical space of reasons," and this means the social space in which the text is produced. If we take communication between embodied speakers as the paradigm for the linguistic activities in and by which we make our way in the world— including reading and writing texts—we will no longer occupy the position of spectators looking out on the external world. Rather, we will be "always already" in-the-world and in a logical space that is no longer internalized, deformed, or withdrawn from the public world. 5. The Logical—and Social—Space of Reasons The recognition that we occupy a logical space of reasons is itself an integral part of our making our way in the world. Knowing how to do things does not exhaust our possibilities for knowledge; we can claim that we know how to ride a bicycle without asserting at the same time that we know the laws of physics that describe our actions, but we can also know the laws of physics—that interacting in such and such a way with physical things will—or should—have certain consequences. We articulate ex plicitly our ability jointly to develop and refine strategies for making our way, bodily, around our shared space, and in so doing we understand each other implicitly as intentional. Thus we engage in discursive practices that themselves constitute powerful tools for making our way in the world. We know that we communicate, and we ask questions about how this is possible. We know why we say that if you believe .v is a lion, you also believe—or ought to believe—that x is dangerous. In short, we know—or can know—what our reasons are for believing what we believe and acting as we act. This kind of knowledge is characteristic of linguistic communities more established and robust than the minimal social situation previously described, communities in which the speech of individuals constitutes a language as a collective practice. "The structure of meaningful speech implicates the rationality of speakers," notes Margolis, "and the rationality of speakers is a holist projection of legitimating norms drawn from the collective life of a historical society" (1995, 189). 26 Being ours, it must be social interaction. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="20">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 597 Rationality, on this model, is derived from our linguistic practices as ways of making our way in the world; echoing Robert Brandom, we turn "something we can initially only do into something we can say: codifying some sort of knowing how in the form of a knowing that" (2000a, 8).2 Knowing that P is knowing how P functions inferentially as a conclusion of some argument or as a premise in another, knowing what one is committed to when one says P. To say P entails undertaking these commitments and acknowledging them, as well as "authorizing" others to use "P" in an inference, and being willing to demonstrate P "as the conclusion to an inference from other such commitments to which one is or can be entitled" (11). In undertaking these commitments and author izing others to attribute to us whatever follows from our commitments, and by attributing commitments to others and holding them responsible for whatever follows from these commitments, we recognize the possibil ity of incorrect as well as correct performances. In attributing intentional states to ourselves and to others that go beyond the ones that are explicit in our performance, our normative reach exceeds our grasp. But seeing ourselves as embodied creatures negotiating a shared space suggests that the concept of discursive practices be sufficiently broad to include, as Rouse suggests, perception and actions as practical achieve ments, patterns of practical/perceptual intra-action with the world. Such intra-action is causal and part of a practical configuration of the world within which agents are differentially situated (258). Causality, on Rouse's view, belongs to configurations as phenomena—repeatable patterns whose structures involve norms of correct or incorrect repetition, and not to the individual objects that are their constituents. We can and do find better ways of making our way(s) in the world than has been our custom, and thus we subject our customs to scrutiny and criticism if and when they interfere with our continuing to make our way in the world, or with our finding or making new ways in the world. For Rouse, science is the example par excellence of our finding—or making— new ways in the world; scientific practices are interventions that are themselves causal intra-actions with what is to be understood, and they affect the way things turn out. Such practices are identifiable by their normative accountability rather than by any performative or disposi tional regularity. Semantic and epistemic normativity are thus tied to practical and political normativity, and we understand the modality of causal processes on the basis of the normativity of scientific practices 27 In saying that "we turn something we can initially do into something we can say: codifying some sort of knowing how in the form of a knowing that," Brandom (2000a, 8) is not, I think, distinguishing prelinguistic behavior from that in which we do things with words. Rather, he is distinguishing between using words to do something and using words to make explicit what we are doing when we do things with words. It is not clear, however, whether Brandom's account of rationality is consistent with the emphasis above on embodiment; but see Rouse (2002). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="21">598 JOANNE B. WAUGH rather than the reverse. Indeed, Rouse's claims are part of his program substantially to revise the philosophical concept of naturalism. On the dominant conception of naturalism, it is not possible to see how empirical science and its conception of the natural world could disclose a world in which semantic, epistemic, or other norms are compatible with nature as revealed by the sciences. Rouse's radical reconceptualization of natural ism offers concepts of science, the natural world as disclosed by it, and their philosophical interpretation as irreducibly normative. Rouse hopes to capture what he takes to be at stake in a commitment to naturalism: that there be no arbitrary impositions on science, that is, that philosophy be continuous with empirical science, and that philosophers make no appeal to anything "supernatural." The suggestion that causality belongs to phenomena rather than objects, phenomena that we have a hand in producing, is of course at odds with the dominant conception of naturalism articulated by Margolis, for any number of reasons, not least of which is that explanation is not restricted to casual explanation alone, which obviates or reduces questions of legitimation, or rather that there is no "causality alone" in which the contrast is between norms and nature. Articulating any prelinguistic or preconceptual content to which language is responsible itself requires semantic articulation,28 and accord ing to Margolis it is through such interpretative acts that we "text" the world, that is, endow it with meaning. In Davidson's minimal social situation described above, we can and do communicate with others in a shared space, and such communication does allow us to triangulate the relations between whatever exists besides us and us as speakers, and in so doing to establish a practical configuration of the world within which we are differentially situated. The more established and robust linguistic communities in which we do science and philosophy and history are "always already" practically configured, and thus are we provided with the discursive practices through which we negotiate the world and its communities and its texts. As participants in these practices we come to know our communities, their texts, and the world, but it is perhaps misleading to describe our engagement in these practices as acts of interpretation. Rather, as David Novitz (2000) suggests, it makes more sense to regard what we consider knowledge as descriptions rather than as interpretations, even if what we now take ourselves to know was the result of interpretation at some earlier time or in a minimal social situation. Novitz insists that a current description is not just a "covert" interpretation; "it is a confirmed interpretation that not only renders something intelligible but also that promotes reliable understanding.... As a result, it places us in an epistemically stronger position regarding the world than any unconfirmed 28 This is Davidson's point about conceptual schemes; I take the phrasing of it from Rouse (2002, 18). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="22">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 599 interpretation can do—something that we discover through our success ful interaction with, or our actions in, the world around us" (8). Novitz suggests that we use "interpretation" in one of two ways: to refer to the act of trying to understand something that is puzzling us by formulating a guess, hypothesis, or conjecture (elucidatory interpretation); or to denote one's attempt to resolve what is left indeterminate in some object or activity (elaborative interpretation). The epistemic structure of elucida tory interpretations requires that one be puzzled and aware that there is something one does not understand; the (stronger) epistemic structure of descriptions requires one knows that one can make sense of what is being described (7-8). But even if all of our empirical knowledge were dependent on interpretations, it still would not follow that whatever exists besides us was cognitively intransparent (Novitz 2000, 10). Indeed, Novitz takes the aforementioned difference in epistemic structure as one reason for insisting that "interpretation is the very process that makes the world cognitively accessible and when successful, renders the world cognitively transparent—not in the sense that it affords us direct unmediated access to it, but in the sense that, as soon as the interpretation works and for so long as it continues to work, there is no good reason to doubt, and considerable reason to maintain, that one does have cognitive access to those aspects of the world that it purports to reveal" (10-11). If our interpretations of the world are and continue to be successful, then it is misleading, suggests Novitz, to "interpret" our relationship to the world as one of cognitive intransparency. From the fact that we know the world by virtue of discursive practices it does not follow that it is cognitively intransparent. Indeed, the very notion of cognitive intransparency is, Novitz points out, paradoxical; if this notion is not an interpretative construct then at least one thing is nontransparent. But if it is an interpretative construct, why accept it, for anything that would count as a reason for believing that what we say about the world is an interpretative construct would also count as a reason for saying that this is the way the world is (11). That our discursive practices are part of the collective life of a historical society—"that thinking has, and is, a history"—raises ques tions about the cultural and historical specificity of these practices and whether any such set of practices are reflective of human thinking, not merely one community's thinking. A conceptual scheme may be abstracted, of course, from a discursive practice, but as such this scheme is neither fixed, a priori, nor "internal." That our discursive practices are—or can be—historical phenomena or artifacts argues against the idea of a conceptual scheme as being anything other than an abstraction from a discursive practice and the web of beliefs and actions in which we as embodied participants in this practice are "always already" caught up. And our embodiment amid other bodies in shared space means that even © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="23">600 JOANNE B. WAUGH though our thinking has a history, we can—literally—change horizons and, in so doing, adopt new practices.29 Nor does the historicity of our beliefs occlude us from finding new or different ways of construing cultural beliefs or from seeing cultural beliefs as not natural, sacrosanct, or invariably correct in the sense of being immune from revision (Novitz 2000, 14). Of course, these beliefs are natural in the Rousian sense of "naturalism," the sense in which the logical and social space of reasons is also a natural space of reasons. 5. Conceptualizing the Ability to Conceptualize: The Beginnings of "Philosophy" That we may find new ways of construing cultural beliefs, and that we see them as neither invariably correct nor immune from revision, does not preclude or occlude us from doing philosophy or from writing its history. It is true that the discovery that language is the very being of philosophy, coupled with the discovery that thinking has or is a history, does pose problems for some traditional views of philosophy and also raises questions about whether and how we write the history of philosophy. The history of philosophy as practiced by some contemporary philoso phers often proceeds as if the problems of philosophy are there (wherever "there" is) for any rational being who thinks philosophically (whatever "thinking philosophically" is.) Philosophical problems are thus timeless, and the answers to these problems, though written by a particular philosopher at a particular time and in a particular language, are read as timeless statements, statements that may have a grammatical tense but are logically tenseless. As such their meaning is—somehow—supposed to be independent of the occasion of their utterance or inscription, inde pendent, indeed, of utterance or inscription at any time, and as such they are independent of the forms of life in any particular society. In short, this is the view of the history of philosophy in which philosophy has no history. If we regard philosophical thinking as we would any other human artifact, then philosophy is a part of the real human world and a product of the historically changing conditions of actual human life. The condi tions include the collective practices of a society, the sharing and internalization of which can form and empower linguistically and cognitively apt persons. If we study the history of philosophy as we study other artifacts, we study it as we do other documents. These are, of course, accessible to us only by means of language—the language(s) in which we interpret the documents of the past, and the language(s) in which these documents are written. And as the recent history of philosophy itself teaches, we can no longer see language as merely an 29 Here I follow Novitz (2000, 14) in intentionally echoing Gadamer (1988, 271). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="24">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 601 instrument that we choose to make as transparent or as neutral as possible. Language is not something separate from the world in which we live; we live in a world because, being embodied, we speak to each other in a shared space. There is no world without language, but this does not mean, of course, that the world is only language. Rather, speaking to and with each other is our way of being-embodied-in-the-world, or as Heidegger might put it, we dwell linguistically in the world. We can also speak to each other about how we dwell linguistically in the world, that is, we can try to make explicit in language how speaking to and with each other is our way of being embodied in the world. In so doing, we can try to make explicit how the normative force of the better reason can be captured in language, that is, how we can do philosophy. To do philosophy we must take up the texts that constitute this practice, and these texts are neither neutral nor transparent. Nor are they in a state of permanent intransparency, for they can be interpreted and understood if we recover the context in which they were produced. For just as a speaker conveys meaning not just by her utterance but also by her gestures and movements, her intonation and phrasing, the expression on her face and the stance of her body, the writer of a text conveys meaning not only by adopting a "style" but also by choosing this style and these words for a certain audience at a certain time in contrast to other choices. To determine what a text "means" requires knowledge not only of the language that the inscribed marks are meant to record but also the context(s) in which the text was produced and is being read, the literary history of which this text forms a part and which is the source of its allusions, and the interpretative communities to which it is addressed or which are engaged in its interpretation. Far from being the "autono mous" linguistic entity of "New Criticism," a text depends on an encultured reader to give it "voice" and meaning, to embody it, as it were. In other words, it requires a speaker—or reader—who is a representative of the cultural and interpretative community of which the author of that text is also a member. The reader attempts to understand what the author is trying to say through his text, just as one who hears another's words tries to understand their meaning. But while speaker and hearer can "negotiate meaning" in a shared space, a reader does not share the writer's historical and material context, and she must recover this context in order to recover the meaning of the text. This is true of philosophical writing as well, despite its pretensions that "any rational being" could understand its meaning, that this meaning is somehow independent of the cultural and interpretative community in which it is written. As a human artifact with its own distinctive and changing history, philosophical thinking consists of—among other things—the analysis of those collective practices of doing and saying that Brandom has characterized as inferential practices: knowing how P functions as a © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="25">602 JOANNE B. WAUGH conclusion of some argument or as a premise in another; knowing what one is committed to when one says P; knowing and acknowledging that one who says P undertakes these inferential commitments and authorizes others to use "P" in an inference; and knowing how and being willing to demonstrate P as the conclusion to an inference from other such commitments to which one is or can be entitled. Thus we use language to analyze explicitly our practices of doing and saying, practices in which we as speakers share our world. On this understanding of philosophy, philosophical discourse begins with Plato's dialogues, where we find Socrates attempting "to bring our practices under rational control by expressing them explicitly in a form in which they can be confronted with objections and alternatives, a form in which they can be exhibited as the conclusions of inferences seeking to justify them on the basis of premises advanced as reasons, and as premises in further exploring the consequences of accepting them" (Brandom 2000a, 56). But this means that Plato chose to write philosophy in the form of dramatic dialogues featuring historical figures from classical Greece for philosophical reasons, not the least of which was that of presenting us with invaluable information about the forms of life that Socrates and his interlocutors seek to bring under rational control by articulating their inferential structure. If we study these dialogues in their historical and material contexts, we find that the Socratic elenchus stands in contrast to the practice of answering questions about why one believes what one believes or does what one does by recalling muthos. Muthos is, in Veyne's words, "authorless poetry," because it recounts "what everybody knows" (1988, 64). For the early Greeks, muthos is speech that "simply speaks itself," for it preserves an ancient and traditional wisdom that belongs simultaneously to everyone and to no one. It is the epitome of public speech, for in Greece's dark age and archaic age, in which writing was unknown or known to only a few members of the populace, muthos can only be public speech. In adopting the public performance of rhythmic speech as the occasion of paideia the early Greeks did as any society would that lacked a writing system sufficiently simple, unambiguous, and exhaustive for representing speech in order to permit the development of a wide body of readers and writers, as well as the material and institutional practices necessary to support literate techniques of preser ving and transmitting culturally significant communication. Members of literate societies sometimes forget that human societies preserved and transmitted their culturally significant information through speech long before they invented literate means for accomplishing these ends. But oral preservation and transmission of "what everybody knows" must take a form that enables everyone—bard and audience—to remember this wisdom, and thus is it muthos, a story of anthropomorphic gods and heroes, a story in which necessity is expressed by Zeus shaking the © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="26">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 603 lightning, or by Helen beckoning Paris or Menelaus to her bed. The needs of memory govern the needs of oral composition and performance; what is recounted must be doings and happenings, repeated actions and incidents, and they can be recounted in whatever order narrative memory allows. They are recounted in a diction that is rhythmical, formulaic, and repetitive, a language consisting of images that are easy to visualize and hard to forget, a language that flows like honey and is so beautiful that it must come from the gods. Oral poetic performances, like the unsigned monuments and statues that adorn the landscape of early Greece, are preserved and sustained in public spaces; indeed, such performances are part of the very notion of a public space (Detienne 1996). And public space, as Vernant (1982, 181 82) and Detienne (1996, 97-102) have argued, is the space of reasons; it is a "democratic space" in which reason is developed and formulated as Greeks engage in debate on how they should govern themselves.30 For in the classical period as in the archaic, meaning is in mortals, and in nature, and in talk, and "the space of reasons" is not (or not merely) interiorized space. The problem is not one of moving from the space of reasons— linguistic and conceptual things—to the world that is (somehow) outside it. What we would call "linguistic" has meaning, of course, but meaning is not confined to what we would think of as linguistic. Utterances and inscriptions are semata, but so, too, are tokens and pictograms, and scars, like the scar that allowed Eurycleia to recognize Odysseus despite his stranger's disguise. Semata may also include natural phenomena, such as Zeus's thunderbolt that both assures Odysseus of his impending victory over the suitors and prompts the woman at her mill grinding wheat to utter the prayer that this be the suitor's last day on earth. This prayer, in turn, provides Odysseus with the vocal sign (pheme) that he had also asked Zeus to provide. By the end of the archaic age, anagignoskein (recognition) is used for recognizing a sema and for reading a text: what is recognized is what the sema means, and it does not have to be spoken or written to have a meaning. Thus does the trustworthiness of an assertion come to be tied to a speaker, to the space in which he speaks, and to the size of an audience that he can command (literally as well as metaphorically). The trust worthiness of a speaker is conveyed not just by what he says and where he stands when he says it, but also by how he looks and stands when he speaks. One's sophia and one's arete are evident not only in one's words but also in one's body. The Athenians, says Pericles, can philosophize without loss of manliness (philosophoumen aneu malakias). One's body and one's voice need to be trained to stand, move, and speak in a way fitting for a Athenian, thus does Greek paideia consist, as Socrates says, of 30 Richard Sennett (1994) provides a nice discussion of how the architecture of Athens reflects this conception of public space.

The problem for the ancients, then, is not one of finding meaning—they have more than enough of it—but of determining which meaning or which sign among the many possible ones is genuine, right, trustworthy. The contrast is one of meaningful objects and events that might be recognized by people in the know, so to speak, and misleading, ambiguous, or deceitful objects and events that can lead mortals astray. Communication, recognition, the uncovering of truth—the correct, explicit statement of what is meaningful and necessary—are processes of interrogation, questioning, dialogue.31 One cannot simply accept appearances at face value, but if one knows how to look, what questions to ask, then one may discover what is true, or what derives, indeed, from the authority of the divine. The authority for muthos thus comes from having heard this story from a great singer, who in turn heard it from another, and who can trace his authority back to the singer Homer, who reports that he was inspired by the Muses and thus claims a divine source for his authority. This notion of divine authority is present also in the notion that what exists besides us—and, perhaps, in us—is a Thinking, Speaking Being, one that is natural but also material and divine, and thus not subject to those forces that render the lives of mortals derivative, fragile, ephemeral, and precarious. Toward the end of the archaic period, poet-philosophers will describe this Thinking, Speaking Being as communicating with mortals through the logos that is in things and in thoughts and assertions about them. As a vehicle for Panhellenic cultural communication, the power and success of oral story singing helps to explain why public speech persists as the preferred occasion for such communication long after the introduc tion of the Greek alphabet in the eighth century. Still, writing allows speech to be fixed in an enduring substance; it makes the text independent of a particular speaker or reader. By separating a statement from speaker and audience, writing permits the kind of reflection and analysis that emancipates meaning from context and allows, too, alternative claims regarding truth and justification. The separation of a text from its speaker permits reflection on, and analysis of, the medium and the content of what is communicated. Poet and artist can then think differently about poesis (Detienne 1996, 102ff.). Detienne takes the fact that, in contrast to the unsigned objects of earlier times, signatures begin to appear on the base of statues and monuments the end of the seventh century as signs of an emerging "consciousness" about the character of poesis (109-10). One finds similar signs of this consciousness in Simonides, who is among the first poets to recognize themselves through their speech, a "recognition" that ruptures the tradition of the inspired poet for whom speaking "came as naturally 31 See Nagy's discussion of zelema at 1996, 1. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="28">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 605 as breathing" (116).32 The self-referential character of poetry is exempli fied in Simonides's boasts about his skill, and this self-referential poetry attests to the emergence of poetry as a profession in which memory is more a secularized technique than a privileged form of knowledge and a religious power granted to a precious few by the gods. Vernant (1983, 215) and Detienne (1996, 89) insist that the secularization of speech is a condition of the rise of the democratic polis as citizens engage in public debate to define and refine the truths needed to govern the polis. Indeed, the public debate about the truths necessary to govern the polis produces democratic knowledge, and while describing knowledge as "democratic" may appear as a category mistake for the modern philosopher, Josiah Ober suggests that neither the possibility nor the "normative desirability" of apolitical knowledge about society or its members would have occurred to the ordinary Athenian (1996, 149). For the Athenian, democratic knowledge consists of the kind of practical configuration of the world that Rouse identifies with the practical and perceptual compe tences, actions, and practical achievements in and through which seman tic and epistemic normativity are tied to practical and political normativity. Democratic knowledge is thus a matter of communicative interaction and learning by intelligent embodied creatures and not the Cartesian subjects for whom the space of reasons is withdrawn from space that is natural and social. So it is that the very definition of a public space comes to include rhetoric in addition to poetic performances, statues, and monuments. The importance of public debate in securing "democratic knowledge" was a large factor in the Sophists' development of a logon techne, the inquiry into the relation between speech and reality and the relation between speech and audiences. This inquiry is permitted and encouraged by the increasing use of written texts in the preservation and performance of culturally significant communication. But this "secularization" of speech has negative as well as positive consequences, for just as a writing allows a message or "text" to be separated from its author and his context, the secularization of speech permits the separation of mortals' thought and speech from the immortals that make it genuine and true. This separation, in turn, encourages the notion that the ways of mortals—their nomoi—stand in opposition to what they are as part of nature (phusis). With the secularization of speech comes the possibility of a chasm between mortals and immortals, on the one hand, and mortals and nature, on the other. The secular space of the democratic city—the space of reasons—is thus in danger of being marked off from the space of the gods and the space of nature. Language runs the risk of being merely an 32 Hesiod (Theogony, 1-103) appears to be the first to mention himself, and he compares his function as a poet in society to the role of the Muses on Olympus (Havelock 1963, 97-114). © Metaphilosophy LLC and BlackweJl Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="29">606 JOANNE B. WAUGH instrument for trying to control and direct the behavior of other men and even other natural things, rather than the occasion on and by which the invisible becomes visible and mortals experience a connection to the immortals and the intelligibility of nature. Hence we find Attic prose texts of the late fifth century—texts traditionally identified with the Greek Enlightenment, the rise of the Sophists, and the history of Greek rhetoric. Pointing out the "calculated" and "artificial" character of rhetorical prose texts, Thomas Cole argues that they are designed to provide general principles or exemplary arguments suitable for memorization and applicable on any number of occasions (1991, 112). Such texts can be circulated for pedagogical purposes or sold to those whose lack of proficiency in public speech makes them dependent on written texts. A text of this sort can be labeled a techne, and insofar as a techne leaves the choice of principles and arguments to students' and clients' discretion, it permits, though it does not entail, that one may choose to make the worse argument better, and do so for worse reasons rather than better. Lacking the particular or contextual details that explain whether and how a principle might apply in this instance, or why one argument is better in this case, a techne is, at best, incomplete. Without an account as to why this principle is sound or this argument suitable, the techne, at worst, persuades not by reason but by the appearance of reason, for no effort is made to deal "with the calculated series of choices that must take place if the general, once formulated, is to be re-embodied in a new verbal structure suitable to the speaker's purpose" (Cole 1991, 93). Rhetorical technai are rational instruments only in the sense in which they are a means to an end, not in the sense in which they aim at capturing the normative force of the better reason. Thus do Socrates's criticisms of writing in the Phaedrus constitute an "attack" upon such technai (Cole 1991, 123). It is writing qua techne and not writing qua writing that comes under fire, which is hardly surprising given the limited use of writing in Athens during the classical period. Socrates insists that a written techne cannot substitute for the kind of learning that results from a close association between teacher and pupil; a written techne cannot answer questions about its meaning and purpose or defend itself from attacks and is thus vulnerable to misinterpretation (Phaedrus, 274b-78e2). Such a text is mute until acted upon by the voice of a reader; this voice need not be the "original" voice—the "author" of the text—or even be associated with the "author." A written text, says Socrates, just keeps saying the same thing over and over. A techne does not engage in dialogue with its reader or hearer, and thus it neither exhibits nor enacts embodied speakers transacting meaning and agree ment in a shared space of reasons. Indeed, written texts may provide a misleading picture of language, one in which fixed meanings are "read off' from nature, the mind, or reality, and one in which speech and © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="30">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 607 writing are merely instruments for transmitting these already fixed truths. If one couples such a picture with the ontological and epistemological gulf between mind and matter—or spirit and nature—that Descartes insti tutes in modern philosophy, speech, and the logical space of reasons that speech generates, will become interiorized, and natural bodies, including our own, and the space that they occupy—natural, social, and cultural— will be devoid of meaning. Bringing ancient Athenian practices, especially material-inferential practices, under rational control means, therefore, that Socratic method and Platonic dialogue must stand in contrast both to muthos, the traditional speech and way of speaking in archaic Greece, and to rhetoric, a proficiency in public speech entailing the conscious manipulation of whatever prompts a better reception for one's message.33 In choosing to write dramatic dialogues, Plato manages to avoid the shortcomings of both the written technai, circulating around Athens, and the muthos. Although Plato's dialogues are written, they aspire "to as total a recrea tion as possible of the effect of communication, and so to an ability to compete for public attention which techne never possessed or sought" (Cole 1991, 115). And unlike technai that circulate privately and are studied in preparation for debate, Plato's dialogues dramatize the actual terms and consequences of engaging in debate. In preserving the perfor mative and contextual elements of speech at the same time as it demands explanations and arguments for and against the principles that are invoked in urging and justifiying actions, the dialogue reenacts philoso phical inquiry—"the art of giving and asking for reasons." As a philosophical drama, the dialogue allows its audience to experience almost first-hand (or in a way that is second-best) what other forms of writing neither encourage nor allow: the lived social practices, the normative structure of which must be made visible or explicit in order for Plato's audiences—ancient and modern—to occupy the space of reasons. In Plato's dialogues, mortals come to understand concepts—or try to—by applying them, by saying that such and such is the case because that is how one ought to make one's way in the world ... as everybody knows. Participants in Socratic conversations typically find the questions difficult, but perhaps for reasons rather different from those of Plato's modern readers. Plato's ancient audiences are asked to justify their assertions and their actions by making explicit the inferential relations showing why one assertion or action is reason for another. The ancient audience does not possess—as do modern audiences—an explicit, articulated theory of inference, or the practice of analyzing linguistic utterances, or the material and institutional practices that enable theory formation. Plato's modern audiences may find participation in Socratic conversations difficult because, unlike the ancient Greeks, they seek 33 This definition of rhetoric is given by Cole (1991, ix). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="31">608 JOANNE B. WAUGH rationality not in communication with others but in a thinking, talking subject's experience of a mute and mindless world, a world in which, as Margolis reminds us, there is nothing that is fixed, transparent, or ahistorical, not even (in) our documents. Ours is a subject-centered model of rationality with a two-place relation between subject and object, while ancient audiences hold a communicative model, a three-place relation between what causes interlocutors to have beliefs and what they agree to say about them and each other. This modern view ill fits the social practices of Plato and his contemporaries, for whom intelligibility is found in a logical space of reasons that is—or can be—a social and a natural space. What needs to be determined is whether and when one is genuinely occupying this space. When participants in a Socratic conversation ask for—or are asked to give—the reasons "everybody has" for believing "what everybody knows," and of determining among all those offered which are good, true, and just and which are bad, fallacious, and unwarranted, and thus harmful to the soul, they are being asked to articulate the normative structure of social practices that differ markedly from our own. In their practices, justification for one's actions is provided through speech publicly performed: first by bards who claim divine inspiration and divine sanction for their songs, and then by poets and orators who aspire to their audience's assent by manipulating what they say and how they say it. It is Plato's Socrates who suggests that the only force that should direct our actions is the normative force of the better reason. It is Platonic dialogue that enjoins Plato's contemporaries to articulate the inferential structures justifying beliefs and actions, to make what was invisible visible: the force of the better reason. In discovering the fine structure of normativity, Socrates is led to the Forms, although the dialogues as dramatic conversations show that mortals cannot grasp in a single proposition the normative force of the better reason, for this force consists not in any single proposition but in relations between them. But perhaps mortals can—for one brief shining moment—see the normative force of the better reason as that which makes possible the articulation of reasons, for just as the sun gives light to all places we can see, so the Form of the Good provides normative force for all the chains of reasons we give for how we ought to live. When asked why it is that they should believe justice is "benefiting one's friends and harming one's enemies," or how it is possible that love is a potential source of harm, or if it is a pious act to prosecute one's own father—by asking for and giving reasons for what they do—Socrates and his interlocutors continually ask themselves whether and why their speech is genuine, trustworthy, and just, and whether their actions and beliefs are justified. Thus, as Brandom says, "was philosophy proper born when Plato took as an explicit topic of understanding and explanation the Socratic procedure of exploring, querying, and grooming our concepts ... © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005</page><page sequence="32">WRITING THE HISTORY OF HISTORIED THOUGHT 609 so as to expose their potential incompatibility" (2000c, 176.)34 And Plato's dialogues continue to remind us that in order truly to examine our beliefs and the inferential relations that support them and are exhibited in our actions, our convictions, the choices we make, and the lives we lead, we need to be able to "see" these beliefs within the terms of interpersonal, if not public, debate. Only by offering our beliefs to the scrutiny of others are we able to test their veracity or their weakness, their value or their harm. For us language is certainly not as transparent as it was for the ancients, but if we remain open to the ancient idea of speech as capable of making things happen, we might not shy away from the imperative placed upon us by the history of historied thought: by giving and asking for reasons we create a public space of reasons, a space in which there is neither room nor need to hide from the force of a better reason, a force that emerges in discussion and asks that we change our lives.
