<plain_text><page sequence="1">181 COMMENTATIONES On Understanding Syncretism1 Hans Bonnet (1887-1972) Translated by John Baines Within the broad range of our field of study, religion has probably at- tracted the attention of scholars more strongly than any other area. Recent years in particular have seen rich and valuable work on religious materials. This effort has not gone unrewarded. We have learned to see more clearly - here I think in particular of Sethe's work on Amun2 - and to compre- hend more deeply. Nonetheless, anyone who seeks to move beyond a com- mand of the evidence toward an inner understanding must concede that the results of our research have not led us past the outer periphery of such an understanding. "Studies in depth are lacking", as the dedicatee of this vol- ume has pronunced3, and who would wish to dispute that? 1 ["Zum Verständnis des Synkretismus", Zeitschrift fur Ägyptische Sprache und Alter- tumskunde 75 (1939) 40-52. That volume was dedicated to Heinrich Schäfer, who is alluded to several times; it contains a bibliography of Schäfer' s publications, including those alluded to, on pp. 1-16. A short note on translation strategies may be helpful. I use male pronouns both in references to Gott in the German and in alluding to human beings. To do otherwise would be cumbrous and would falsify Bonneťs thought a little. So far as possible I render Bonnet's Gott with "god" and Gottheit with "deity". Another difficulty is the choice of rendering of Gott between "god" and "God", where German does not need to make a distinction. In English the former usage is uncon- ventional as a generalization, but in most cases in the article it appears closer to what Bonnet meant and I therefore adopt it. He may sometimes have meant "God"; the reader can decide when. Similarly, Bonnet used the historic present in a manner alien to English that allowed him occasionally not to distinguish between generalizations about the ancient Egyptians and ones to which he would himself have subscribed. I have rendered almost all such passages in the past tense.

The foot- notes are added by myself and are placed in square brackets. The translation is otherwise pre- sented as a self-standing entity.

As a first step, people will no doubt seek guidance from findings in the general history of religions. One must indeed know about these: they sharpen one's eyes, while also inevi- tably leading one astray, for "parallels" always bring some alien discourse with them and for that reason may miss the point. I do not need to cite ex- amples. With time, people have no doubt acquired a sense of the dangers inherent in the comparative method. These have not, however, been avert- ed, but rather have become subtler and hence more deceptive. Scholars no longer restrict themselves to juxtaposing single phenomena that are similar or appear so to the outsider and then interpreting them in relation to each other. Rather, they go deeper, assimilating complexes identified by histori- ans of religions and interpretations of philosophers of religion, and then approaching the Egyptian material with the resulting issues and insights in mind. But in doing so one all too easily constrains one's vision and in the end seeks only to replicate conclusions already reached on the basis of dif- ferent sources. And such conclusions will emerge. The language of cult is polysemous, and religious concepts are imprecise and variable. They can therefore fit almost any system that may be brought to bear upon them - but only, of course, because they are wrenched from the twilight in which they belong into the clarity of unambiguous propositions. Yet to treat them in this way is to deprive them of some of their essence. That is why sys- tematic studies of religious beliefs that are influenced by the history or philosophy of religions tend to result in exaggerations, or worse, dis- tortions, even if their method is basically correct and they arrive at valu- able insights. The difficulty is that they do not take into account the inher- ent variability and absence of sharp definition in Egyptian concepts. If one is to comprehend Egyptian thought, one must at the least be aware of these characteristics. Such a comprehension can only be achieved through com- plete immersion in the ancient tradition. We must learn to work our way into the Egyptians' mental universe with a maximum of detachment and to set aside anything that comes from an alien world of discourse. To use the dedicatee's words again, we must kindle in ourselves "what could be called thinking and feeling in Egyptian"4. That is a demanding challenge; I myself would remain silent if I were not well aware that no one can meas- ure up to it completely. My present intention is in any case far more modest. I would not claim so much as even to paraphrase the structure of Egyptian thought. I 4 [H. Schäfer, Principles of Egyptian Art , ed. E. Brunner-Traut, trans, and ed. J. Baines, re- vised reprint (Oxford 1986) 6.]</page><page sequence="3">On Understanding Syncretism 183 hope to improve the understanding of just one constituent element in that structure, albeit a crucial one for the tenor of Egyptian religion: the tend- ency toward syncretism. This is fundamental for the Egyptians. Syncretism did not emerge gradually; it forms part of the basis of Egyptian thought. It is more than a matter of religious feeling; it defines the paths along which thought travels, and that is what makes it so difficult for us to approach. Syncretistic thought does not obey the laws of logic. It does not separate things, as we do when we struggle to present a concept clearly. It does not divide or remove whatever accretions a concept may have gathered by as- sociation from elsewhere in the interests of highlighting its core and es- sence. It goes out in pursuit of every phenomenon that in some way em- bodies the issue that is its concern; in this way it moves from one context to another and its perspective shifts continually. Instead of focusing on a single point, it tends toward breadth. The circles it encompasses become ever larger. We may feel that everything merges together, and we are cast continually into new contexts and modes of experience. In each of these circles we enter a new domain that is at the least different in character from the last. Yet unless the structures of Egyptian thought are wholly ar- bitrary and lacking any kind of order, they must have some truth content; and indeed they do. For all these circles share a single centre. The per- spective changes but the point of view remains the same. Threads therefore lead back from diverging elements to an ultimate single experience and thus cohere over a vast domain. I should like to illustrate this point in terms of a relatively manage- able example, that of the ka concept. To the alien eye, this notion encom- passes the most varied phenomena, material and immaterial, personal and impersonal, temporal and eternal. But if we penetrate further, we may sense that through all the variation in approach a single matter is ad- dressed, and that is a comprehension of the mystery of life. People have a sense of a hidden force that enlivens and animates dead matter. Itself in- visible and timeless, the force enters bodies that are fixed in time and space. It leads and guides them, and is manifest sometimes as a protective spirit or genie, sometimes as fate and character, or it may become close to other powers of life and destiny such as the name, and it reappears even in food as a power that sustains life. If we assimilate all these manifestations and modes of action and allow one or another precedence according to context, but without excluding any of the others, the ka concept acquires a breadth that cannot be accommodated within any definition adapted to our own patterns of thought. But the concept does not dissolve. It has its hid- den centre, toward which all relevant statements point from their respective directions, and in which everything thus coheres.</page><page sequence="4">184 Hans Bonnet Here one might mention the rendering of the human form in Egyptian two-dimensional art. There too, views elaborated from different vantage points combine to form a whole that appears to the intellect to be far from reality and to contain much that is arbitrary, and yet a more penetrating examination reveals an inner truth and restrained life. But it would be in- appropriate to pursue that topic in detail; here I wish only to show that syncretistic thought similarly displays regularities and hence has truth con- tent. Nor should one be disturbed by the polarity of this style of thinking, which is driven not by the demarcating powers of the intellect but by con- stantly shifting subjective stimuli. On occasion it may even spread so far as to encompass diametrical opposites. With this insight in mind, let us approach the problem of the fusion of deities. The goal toward which it strives is clear, as is the situation which provokes it. The intertwining of local religious elements, which be- gins as larger communities form and becomes progressively more complex, requires some clarification: people cannot comprehend plurality unless there exists a principle that can order it as a living entity. The gods must therefore come together to form a unity of some kind. The most obvious procedure would no doubt be to order them on the model of human rela- tionships. Many societies have followed this path, as also did the Egyp- tians. They often grouped the gods who crowded around them into families in which each deity occupied an appropriate place, while one among them ruled with the prerogatives of a monarch or patriarch. But the Egyptians did not find these systems satisfying. Everyone wants to see the deity who for them is the highest placed in prime position in such groupings. The system's rigour then falls victim to the desire to accord primacy to that de- ity, and from one district to another it is softened and distorted in order to satisfy the aspirations of a local particularism that seeks to maintain its old traditions above all else. But what is the source of this particularism's strength? Does it come only from the power of the status quo, being due to a lack of mental flex- ibility or, more crudely put, to the rule of inertia? Or does it not have still deeper roots? It is, after all, unsatisfactory to propose that such powerful phenomena as the local religious life of the nomes derived from something largely negative or from influences that came from outside. We should rath- er seek to understand from within the capacity of town deities to resist at- tack - from the nature of the conception of deity. I believe that the strength of particularism can indeed be illuminated from that perspective. In brief, the Egyptians tended toward a universal understanding of deity; they con- ceived that everything people might expect from the powers who disposed over them was in the hands of the particular deity whom they worshipped.</page><page sequence="5">On Understanding Syncretism 185 The relevance of this understanding is twofold. First, there would surely have been another way of establishing a meaningful association be- tween deities without depriving individual gods of anything fundamental. They needed only to be given specialized roles: their regions and spheres of influence could have been demarcated thematically from one another. Points of departure for such a development existed. These would have had only to be taken up to produce a well balanced system rather like that of the Greek pantheon, in which each deity possessed a distinct space that would not disturb the next and all acted with one accord. But the Egyp- tians did not follow this path, which would moreover have remained with the realm of human analogies; they were unable to follow it. For them, any attempt to confine the workings of deities within partial domains would have amounted to an attack on the universality of their experience of the divine. For that reason there were no true "special deities"5 in ancient Egypt. There were of course gods who showed themselves to be especially efficacious in one or another domain; but their activity was not completely circumscribed by that domain. Only minor deities dominated well defined areas. Even gods who by their nature had specific missions, such as gods of the dead, tended toward universality. Not only did Egyptians' experience of god tolerate no demarcation of divine natures, it also made it difficult to set another god over and above one's own deity, because that would imply that the latter needed supple- menting. Further tensions emerge here. The Egyptians were well aware that there existed other, more powerful and wider-ranging deities than their own particular ones. They deferred to their claims and trusted in their succour. They could not, however, accept a lessened sway for their town deity, be- cause they were too firmly set in the ancestral belief that divine action directed toward people was indivisibly and completely experienced in that deity. Therefore, even in contexts where religious experience was stimulat- ed by influences from outside, fulfilment was sought in him. The town de- ity was not, after all, unchangeable, but could grow and become greater. In this way, the perceptions sparked by an encounter with a greater deity were applied to the town god, extending his nature so as to encompass the new and greater reality. But that reality was not extinguished or absorbed entirely into the town deity. It remained in existence, and the town god retained the characteristics transmitted to him from the greater deity as something like a loan. To put the matter another way: the Egyptians ac- 5 [Sonder götter, a term introduced by H. Usener, Götternamen : versuch einer lehre von der religiösen begriffsbestimmung (Bonn 1896).]</page><page sequence="6">186 Hans Bonnet cepted both deities in such a way that their nature interpenetrated and fused into one, while nonetheless retaining their own identities. But how could that be so? How can it be that two gods become one and yet are again two? All that I have said so far should help us to com- prehend that the difficulty Egyptians experienced because of the dichotomy between their experience of god and outward circumstances favoured a so- lution in which deities could fuse. We may also appreciate the satisfaction that solution gave to Egyptians, however little we may share it. But we will not get near to an understanding of syncretism itself until we can answer the question posed above, which leads toward the very roots of the phe- nomenon. As before, the search must undoubtedly begin from the content of the concept of deity. What are Egyptian gods? Are they persons, that is, are they beings with a well defined corporeal and spiritual identity? Of course, when an Egyptian called to mind an image of a deity, that deity stood before him in a specific form and had a distinctive character. But this form and char- acter were fashioned essentially according to a human model. The deity spoke and acted, and indeed suffered, in human fashion; the epithets ac- corded to him or her were taken from the human sphere and transcended it only insofar as they tended toward the highest level of humanity, toward the ideal image of lordship and kingship. To that extent the Egyptian con- ception of deity is anthropomorphic. Yet that description sketches only one side of the phenomenon, and not the fundamental one. The anthropomorphic view of gods was entwined with a response on a quite different level. Touched by the mystery of di- vine action, for which no analogy exists, this other mode of experience felt the deity as a power that stands, beyond all apprehension, above the cor- poreal world, and yet moves through and acts upon that world like a flux, thereby revealing itself as ultimate reality. In this way the deity is appre- hended not as a person but as a power that is essentially impersonal and immaterial. It should not be objected here that such a view of the divine is too spiritualized for those distant times. The general history of religions has amply demonstrated how decisively the religious consciousness of primitive peoples is characterized by the sense of an immaterial power. I do not review again research and results in this area - most easily con- sulted in the relevant sections of Karl Beth's Religion und Magie 6 -, I simply recall them. In any case, the Egyptian evidence should speak for it- self. In this context one must of course steer clear from anything that 6 [Religion und Magie: Ein religionsgeschichtlicher Beitrag zur psychologischen Grund- legung der religiösen Prinzipienlehre, 2nd edition (Leipzig and Berlin 1927).]</page><page sequence="7">On Understanding Syncretism 187 might be interpreted as the spiritualizing of simpler concepts and forms of belief. For this reason I refer only to phenomena that are attested already from early periods. First, I cite the "Memphite Theology"7. This text speaks of the god who gave the world its being through the power of the ideas which sprang forth from his heart and became reality through the words of his tongue. It further proclaims that it is he who throughout time brings all beings into, and sustains them in, life. For it, every creature is a revelation of this end- less and inexhaustible creative power. Wherever there is conscious life, it is guided by the powers issuing from the organs with which the god initi- ated creation - the heart and the tongue. Through them he constantly pro- claims himself in every being as the all-prevailing one. The text formulates this insight as "Ptah is in every body, Ptah is in every mouth"8. So god is in people! Much could be said about this conception9, but here I empha- size only that it presupposes experience of the divine as something mobile and fluid. In this case, the power which infuses, vivifies, and animates the corporeal world is Ptah. It might be said, quite correctly, that the voice of this text is that of the theologian, and hence that it attests to a piety nur- tured and refined by the discipline of reflection. Yet in its fundamental no- tions of the essence of the divine, even this piety, which does not proclaim a secret teaching, must stand on a foundation of traditional belief. Indeed, I believe one can demonstrate that the idea of an immaterial power was firmly established even in the earliest times. What of the forms in which the Egyptians worshipped their gods? In their view, these were material objects in which deities presented them- selves to them. But what was the basis of their relation with the gods? - for it was not an identity of form that would have enabled them to embody the divine reality through the magical power of reproduction. The image people have of a deity is not necessarily the same as the form of the lat- 7 [K. Sethe, Dramatische Texte zu altaegyptischen Mysterienspielen (UGAÄ 10, 1928); H.

The gods who were worshipped in animals were of course conceived at one time as being animals, and it was always possible to slip back into that notion. Alongside, however, there existed a spiritual image in which the deity was clothed in the highest and noblest form of being - the human - and recalled the cult object at most through its animal head. The presence of this vision is demonstrated by the human and semi- human images of deities that appear in many places at the beginning of the historical period. These did not create a new situation. Rather, they brought to the surface a view of deity that had long existed in the be- liever's spiritual eye. For that reason they did not replace the old cult ob- jects, which were and remained at the centre of worship, for they were more than likenesses and hence signified more than pictorial representa- tions. They were the abode of the deity, that is, the medium through which he or she was accessible to human interaction. This brings us back to the idea of a power that is at home in the in- visible realm and yet enters and acts in the visible world by imparting it- self to particular bodies. This conception of power also determines the character of the imparting. This is true in two respects. First, a power from an otherworldly sphere that informs a transitory material body is not bound to that body. No medium possesses intrinsically the powers which are im- parted to it. They can leave it again and return home. But they can also - and this is the second point - enter into other mediums. So the deity does not inhabit a cult object in a lasting manner; rather, he or she must constantly be tempted to return. This explains the importance of the ritual performed every morning in all the country's temples to make the cult im- ages ready as abodes for the deities. Furthermore, that inhabiting was not exclusive. Deities could take up residence in a variety of objects; they could even appear in all of them at the same time. Immaterial powers spread in all directions and can show their efficacy anywhere. Multiple manifestations are therefore indeed tokens of a deity's abundant power. Originally each deity no doubt possessed only one cult object. But this situation changed as bands and tribes merged together and their re- spective fetishes came to be associated and to be common property. In the associated debates there took hold the idea - based on the concept of power - that a god could impart his nature to a variety of objects. In many places, more major numina, which demonstrated their power through the importance of their cult places, entered into the fetishes of weaker numina. They often encountered little resistance and so absorbed them completely, which they were able to do because the nature of those numina was not strongly characterized and the majority did not possess proper names. In such cases the result was complete incorporation. It</page><page sequence="9">On Understanding Syncretism 189 could, however, happen that the weaker partner had such a distinct and well established life and was so firmly rooted in the hearts of its communi- ty that it would not simply lose itself in a higher being. Re was evidently able to incorporate the numen of the ben stone10 into himself; but Atum was too major a figure for Re to absorb him completely. Nonetheless, even in such cases the process was basically the same. The stronger god im- parted his nature to the weaker; but he did no more than share it and he did not abrogate the other's independent life. That is how encounters be- tween deities became syncretistic unions. We have already seen how the social context in Egypt favoured such a solution; its point of departure should now also be clear. Thus, syncretistic formulas should be understood in terms of "inhabit- ing". Just as any god can take up abode in a fetish or in an animal, or even in the king, so he can inhabit the body of another deity. The formula Amon-Re does not signify that Amun is the same as Re or that one god has merged into the other. It simply observes that Re is in Amun - but not in such a way that both would be indissociably attached to each other and could continue to exist only in partnership. No inhabiting is per- manent. The partners can separate again and be manifest independently; they can also form unions with other deities. So it is not a contradiction for there to exist, alongside Amon-Re, such figures as Min-Re, Khnum-Re, Re-Atum, or simply Re. Re can enter into one god or another without los- ing his own identity in the process; equally, Amun can have partnerships with Re as Amon-Re and with Min as Amon-Min. No uniting is irrevo- cable, so that no syncretistic formula has the capacity to be exclusive. There is similarly no contradiction if, for example, the falcon god Horus becomes manifest in crocodile gods. Inhabiting is not identification and does not require identity of form. So we close off the way to understanding syncretistic formulas if we subsume them under such headings as identification or equation. The bonds they establish do, however, vary in strength, and there may be cases where those terms would be appropriate. As we have seen, absorption and syncretistic union lie along the same path of development. The distinction between them is one of degree and can become less marked. As com- binations became fixed, and still more through specific factors in the poli- tics of cults, syncretistic formulas could acquire a strength that almost abrogated the separate existence of one partner, who then survived only as 10 [Bonnet used the unreduplicated form of this word occurring in Pyramid Texts Spell 600 (K. Sethe, Die altägyptischen Pyramidentexte II, Leipzig 1910, § 16526) and generally held to be the forerunner of the later bnbn.]</page><page sequence="10">190 Hans Bonnet a special form, in Egyptian terms "another body", of the other deity, or could even be absorbed entirely, as Khentimentiu" was by Osiris. There are therefore several levels of syncretism. It would be difficult to observe and describe these levels because they shift constantly. They are often dis- tinguished only by the speaker's particular situation and current inclina- tions, which may render him open to one or another aspect. I shall not dis- cuss these accommodations in syncretistic feeling any further. I also leave aside ancient theological exegeses of unions between deities. These too can hardly be treated satisfactorily at present, because that would require a deeper comprehension of the language of the cult and of the development of theological concepts than has so far been achieved. I believe that another question is more important for a basic understanding of syncretism: that of evaluation. How should we evaluate the religious content of syncretism, and hence its influence on the level achieved by Egyptian belief? It would be tempting to begin with a critique. For what we feel to be the distinguishing feature of syncretism is primarily its lack of conceptual clarity, which arises from its constantly drawing back from decisions so that it appears to raise the accommodation of opposites12 almost into a principle. An exposi- tion of these aspects would, however, serve little purpose. It would bring few new insights and, more importantly, it would obscure the topic and in- volve applying inappropriate criteria of evaluation. A negative judgment can be justified only after one has learned to appreciate positive qualities; one should therefore first expound what is valuable in syncretism. The phenomenon must of course be taken seriously if its positive features are to be identified; it cannot be simply dismissed as a theological mode of discourse. Such was of course one role, indeed a very major role, of syn- cretism: since it promised easy solutions, it was incorporated into the priests' toolkit and used like a readily available formula. But all this use and misuse of the device should not blind us to the fact that syncretism is a primarily religious issue. If the adherents of the cult of birds of prey rec- ognized their god in the great hawk Horus, or worshippers of Khnum, Min, or another god sensed that their god became so great that they perceived the lord of the sky himself as inhabiting him, that was not a priestly con- struct or a tactic in the politics of cult but a matter of belief. We touch up- on an area that is vital for understanding Egyptian piety if we ask what specific capacities and experiences accrued to it from the syncretistic mind-set. 11 [The god of Abydos, attested by name from the First Dynasty on.] 12 [Compositio oppositorum , in Latin in the original.]</page><page sequence="11">On Understanding Syncretism 191 These capacities become evident to us if we recall the preconditions of syncretism, that is, the character of the Egyptian experience of god. As we have seen, it revolves around two poles. On one side is the perception of the deity as an immaterial power, while on the other is the deity's per- sonal, anthropomorphic configuration. One is tempted to ask which of these two modes of apprehension was the older. Those who are familiar with the general history of religions will be inclined to place the concept of power at the beginning. It may be recalled that even at a primitive level some religions are able to do without a conception of deity that is fash- ioned on the human model. On this basis one could propose that the Egyptian anthropomorphic conception of deity was a secondary devel- opment. That could not of course be proved, and in the Egyptian case this question of priority seems to me to be ultimately insignificant. In the last analysis, the two modes of apprehension probably stood side by side and complemented each other. For when the deity is apprehended as a person on the human model, something is always left over, and that something is precisely what is supplied by the impersonal concept of power; but where the latter is principally experienced, the urge to make that divine power visible and accessible is readily felt. People require something visible. They cannot imagine an effect with no active agent behind it. Religious sensibility, like other forms of apprehension, yearns for something tangible. People require to interact with the deity; ultimately they can do so only in- sofar as he is similar to them. So the emergence of a tangible form neces- sarily results in anthropomorphization. Thus, religious life moves between the poles of material and immate- rial, personal and impersonal, power and form. It is worth recalling that in Egypt such a bipolarity does not characterize only the conception of deity, but can be found wherever something with a mysterious, higher reality is being interpreted. The concepts of ka, akh, and ba, to name only the best known, occupy the same twilight. The secret, invisible powers of existence were experienced through them, and yet they were envisaged as corporeal beings. Akh is the form of spirits and spiritual power, ba is soul in the form of a bird and the power of the soul, and ka is the eternal and individ- ual power of life and at once the genie and double of a human being. This parallelism of characteristics should not disturb us, because these concepts belong ultimately in the same category as that of god. In the present con- text, this parallel should help to reinforce the insights we have arrived at. What do these insights contribute to the evaluation of syncretism? In- sofar as the Egyptian experience of deity had two focal points, it was in a state of tension. If was never directed wholly toward one of the two poles; it oscillated continually between them and was attracted more strongly now</page><page sequence="12">192 Hans Bonnet by one and now by the other. For an appreciation of the character and level of Egyptian piety it is critically important which of the two poles emerged as the stronger. Their religious content was not equivalent; each had its particular qualities and presented its own dangers. Clothing the deity in hu- man features brought him from a remote realm toward humanity, opening the way to a relationship that could overcome the gulf separating humanity and deity with a strength of feeling that is kindled only between human beings and could embody deep devotion and childlike trust. Therein lies the attraction which the anthropomorphized image of the deity always holds for simple people, and Egyptians succumbed to it in full measure. Even the power of syncretism foundered on it. For it is noteworthy that, despite the Egyptians' readiness to take refuge in syncretism when con- fronted by the conflicting claims of different deities, one boundary could not be crossed: that of gender13. Male and female deities were never com- bined in syncretistic formulas. When a god and a goddess came together, they were instead combined as mother and son, or preferably as spouses. Why was this done? No doubt the relationships of son and spouse are in- timate enough to make a duality into a unity and to link two deities to- gether on equal terms. But it is striking that only in this case did the proc- ess stop short at an external linking. In the end this was probably because people remained bound by the anthropomorphic conception of deity. When human parallels offered an adequate solution, they were adopted in prefer- ence; in comparison with syncretistic formulas, they had the advantage of being more comprehensible and vivid. The persuasive power of the anthropomorphic conception of deity ac- centuates the importance of its limits and restrictions. These were evident. The gods came near to people, but this was at the expense of their charac- ter as gods. From the immaterial and incomprehensible they were dragged down into the material and comprehensible, and little of their divinity re- mained beyond their ideal or super-humanity. For the sake of depth of ex- perience it was therefore essential that divinity should not be apprehended only from this pole and hence that people should not fail to acknowledge that the nature of deity encompassed a power that worked from beyond any visible causality to fashion life and events. This is where syncretism was vital. It kept the initial experience of deity as power alive through all the obfuscations produced by the appearance of the anthropomorphic notion of god. In consequence, the Egyptians never succumbed entirely to the error of worshipping images. We know the bitter mockery and scorn which the 13 [For later material, see p. 201 n. 12 in this volume.]</page><page sequence="13">On Understanding Syncretism 193 men of the Old Covenant14 heaped on pagans who worshipped the works of their own hand as gods. It has been suggested that those men were them- selves guilty of a misunderstanding, because deity and image are never found to have been simply equated. Theoretically speaking, that is prob- ably correct; but other men, including such pagans as Celsus (in Origen, Contra Celsum i:5, vu:62), polemicized against idolatry in terms like those of the Prophets. The picture they presented should, therefore, corre- spond to reality. And indeed it is quite comprehensible that naive people who turned to images believed that they had before them not just a route to the deity but the deity himself. Deities were present in images also to Egyptians but they could never lose themselves entirely in them. The prac- tice of the cult was itself a corrective and a safeguard here, because it em- phasized repeatedly that an essential part of the gods, their ba, was in the sky and did no more than descend into cult images. Syncretism, however, made the inadequacy of images completely clear, as indeed it did that of any conception of deity that was based on likeness. For how could it apply to gods who were in contact with and fused with one another as if they were not subject to any restrictions of corporeality? Was it possible to comprehend them in human form, indeed was it possible to comprehend them at all, or was it not necessary to ac- knowledge that the core of their being was hidden from humanity and that they revealed themselves only through their actions, which emerged, like a stream whose sources are not known (Instruction for Merikare15), into the visible world. Syncretism stimulates and sustains a feeling for the irrational in the deity's being. Of course, people strive untiringly to comprehend the deity and to encapsulate his being in ingenious dogmatic formulas. But there comes a time when, despite all these efforts, one senses inescapably that the deity withdraws from any human access, being "too mysterious for it to be possible to discover his majesty [š#í], too great to be investigated, too mighty to be known"16. So all concepts and images are revealed as be- ing questionable. They naturally continue in use; but they are now only a superficial reality behind which, incomprehensible but apprehensible, is an- other, ultimate reality, against which all human measure disintegrates, be- 14 [That is, the covenant with God embodied in the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20, and more generally the religion of the Hebrew Bible.] 15 [Lines 124-7; see e.g. W.

Thus, syncretism repeatedly sets the urge to elevation against the tendency to anthropomorphization which makes the gods similar to what is terrestrial, and frees the conception of god from earthly constraints; through the notion of power it knows or at least senses that the deity is a spiritual being, in Egyptian a ba. In this way it also dissolves polytheism. Of course the gods remain; but the individual features that characterize them and distinguish one from another lose their significance. These fea- tures are on the level of simile and of the visible, whereas religious life strives toward the centre, everywhere encountering the same reality. The conception of god, which syncretism introduced into local cults through the interplay of universal and particularistic tendencies described above, had everywhere the same basic tenor. Everywhere there prevailed the idea of the primeval deity and cosmic ruler who at the beginning created and who continues to influence and sustain everything. The pious encountered this One, in whom all divine efficacy ultimately resides and is based, in forms that varied from place to place. This experience left the way open for the insight that under all names and manifestations only the one, in- trinsically identical reality is apprehended and worshipped. People early came near to this insight, as is shown by the oft-repeated observation that when wisdom texts and other works of imaginative literature discuss the actions of the deity, they speak simply of "god". This term has caused surprise and has often been misinterpreted. It is not the case that it attests to the recollection of a remote "primitive monotheism", and it is quite misguided to propose that it incorporates a distilled and clarified "philo- sophical" conception of deity distinct from that of popular belief. The simple use of the term "god" signifies nothing different from syncretistic formulas. It just speaks more clearly because it is not enmeshed in the conceptual world of theology and so does not need to employ dogmatic formulas. In the last analysis, it too bears witness to the same single di- vine reality, which everyone approached in the guise of his town deity. It should not be overlooked that in living practice the simple statement "god" dissolved once more, because the individual to whom it applied al- ways apprehended that god in his or her particular deity. So polytheism and monotheism are not simple opposites. There is also an "ideal" mono- theism that overcomes the tension between unity and multiplicity by expe- riencing the forms of individual deities as signs that point toward the One who realizes himself in all of them. Syncretism prepared the way for this ideal monotheism because its equations repeatedly drew attention away from visible forms toward their common spiritual basis.</page><page sequence="15">On Understanding Syncretism 195 Syncretism had a further, third effect17. It freed the conception of de- ity from all the less worthy, indeed immoral traits which attach themselves to deities wherever they are formed after a human image. These lost pow- er, indeed they became without substance, as the conception of deity moved forward past individual phenomena to the overarching, universal, spiritualized concept of god. This contribution of syncretism should not be underestimated. It did not merely remove offensive features, it also made it possible to fill the conception of god more effectively with ethical ele- ments. Syncretistic piety itself offered one point of departure for such an ethical transformation, because it had a strong sense of the otherness of deity; it was also conscious of the gulf between deity and humanity. Syn- cretism therefore could not be far removed from the insight that that other- ness also encompassed the moral domain, in other words that a humanity entrapped in sin confronted a morally perfect deity. We do in fact find passages in texts from which there shine forth both knowledge of human sinfulness and an intuition of the sacredness of deity. These passages are of course infrequent and vary considerably in their religious level; overall, they do no more than mark a first step. It would take us too far to ex- emplify this point in detail here, but I should like briefly to sketch the rea- sons for this inadequacy. These reasons relate to basic Egyptian conceptions of the nature of deity, which lie fundamentally beyond the realm of ethics. The idea of power is ethically neutral, and gods imagined in human guise partake fully in human guilt and shortcomings. The ethical factor is naturally not com- pletely lacking, because it is contained within the concept of creation. For at creation the order of the world was defined, and it encompasses the ju- ridical and moral norms governing human social life. These are divinely established. For that reason, the thought and action which they determine and which leads toward their realization, that is, ma' at, is both a character- istic of the divine and a divinely set requirement. But the content of this order18 is completely determined by humanity, as is revealingly exemplified by the frequent characterization of ethical action as "what people love and the gods favour"19. So human satisfaction is the stimulus and the religious foundation comes only afterward. Put another way, religion does not awak- en the moral imperative but adopts it. It is significant that it should do so, 17 [In addition to those discussed in the last two paragraphs, of demonstrating the in- sufficiency of images and resisting anthropomorphization.] 18 [Again a reference to ma' at .] " [Examples in autobiographical texts: J. M. A. Janssen, De traditioneele egyptische auto- biografie vóór het Nieuwe Rijk (Leiden 1946) 1, 46-8 (published after Bonnet's article). The pat- tern is perhaps not as neat as Bonnet implied.].</page><page sequence="16">196 Hans Bonnet but it remains the case that the ethical characteristics of deities attach to them mainly from outside. It is therefore hardly surprising that the ethical transformation progressed slowly and without true tenacity of purpose; for it did not arise from the nature of the conception of god, in contrast with spiritualization, whose basis lay in the notion of power, which was consti- tutive for that of god. That completes a general outline of the specifically religious values concealed within the syncretistic sensibility - and only, or barely, con- cealed. It is not that we can witness a unilinear, purifying, and ascending development of the elements contained in essence at the beginning. Just as Egyptian religious thought oscillated continually between two poles, so syncretism is characterized by double-sidedness and hence by a tendency to half-measures and a repeated shrinking from definitive solutions. It lacked the strength to reject, saying yes to everything that came its way and remaining open to the most varied attitudes. There is no need to ex- emplify this point; it is evident to all. For the present discussion, a con- sequential question is whether the insights that were certainly embedded within syncretistic piety could come to the fore within this play of opposed tendencies; or indeed whether people were even aware of them behind all the imprécisions which disseminated half-solutions and compromises that could only be made on the basis of personal inclination. Despite reserva- tions, this question should be answered in the affirmative. From quite early times we sometimes encounter voices in which a spiritualized piety nur- tured by syncretism is discernible. They are not many and they represent hardly more than the most elevated tone of deeply involved groups who had grown to maturity through their spiritual education. At first, the devel- opments wrought through syncretism were largely unheralded. But a time came when official religion experienced syncretism more deeply and be- came receptive to the purer piety it fostered. For this a specific stimulus was naturally required. The attempted reforms of Amenophis IV gave that stimulus. Something particular should be noted about the relationship between the old and the new belief. The new belief grew upon the ground of tradi- tion. Some observers have been influenced so strongly by these con- nections with tradition that they have remained blind to its innovations. Our dedicatee has uncovered with fine sensitivity and with a convincing clarity the deep misunderstanding which underlies this levelling-down of Amenophis IV's proclamation. It remains true, nonetheless, that the core concerns of traditional beliefs and of the king's teachings are largely con- gruent. They share a feeling for universality and for the uniqueness of di- vine efficacy, which the Amarna teaching raised, in grandiosely one-sided</page><page sequence="17">On Understanding Syncretism 197 fashion, to monotheism; and that was what unleashed conflict. Yet in the last analysis those on either side of the dispute acknowledged the reality of the same experience; the struggle was only about the form which the king had given to it. For that reason the old belief was pressed to incorporate that experience in a guise appropriate to its models of thought and belief. And so people fell back upon syncretistic formulas, which were now com- prehended in all their depth and in awareness of their ultimate implica- tions. The stage was now reached where official religion encompassed the ideal monotheism which had long been sensed but repeatedly comprom- ised. In the midst of a polytheistic world this monotheism was realized through the spiritualization of the concept of deity, and in this way sur- passed Amenophis IV's perception of god. For his vision had been bound to nature, having discarded divine images while remaining tied to the world of the senses because it experienced its god in the sun. The aware- ness of the spiritual nature of deity now grew. It is therefore no coincidence that the finest and noblest instances of Egyptian piety date to the period after Amenophis IV. These are generally seen as reverberations from the shock of Amarna. In reality, however, they embody the more ancient belief, which was now stimulated to realize its ultimate values; to recall Amarna here is justified only insofar as that be- lief attained its fullest form in opposition to Amarna. This means, there- fore, that the peak of Egyptian religion is to be sought not in the Amarna episode but in the time of reaction against it. There is nonetheless much truth in Schäfer's characterization of the reign of Amenophis IV as the great turning point when the destiny of Egyptian civilization was de- termined20. For it was ultimately the king's revelation that stimulated the old belief to reflect upon itself. What was at issue now was whether the old belief would withstand the test, that is, whether it was able to establish and sustain the purer per- ception of god which had emerged. There is no straightforward answer to this question. The new perception was evidently never extinguished; it re- mained the common property of those who were touched by it. Its theolo- gical foundations also gained in coherence. In temple schools syncretism progressed from an often arbitrary fusion to a subtly elaborated system fo- cused upon demonstrating that the god who was worshipped was the one who brought together all divine being in its entire fullness. This perception was, however, constantly at risk. The old polytheistic forms and their own specific traditions continued to exist and the Egyptians were always at risk 20 [E.g. H. Schäfer, Amarna in Religion und Kunst (Sendschrift der Deutschen Orient- Gesellschaft 7; Berlin 1931) 60.] Orientalia - 23</page><page sequence="18">198 Hans Bonnet of slipping back into them; and those who were not able to assimilate the deeper understanding which reduced the forms to the status of pointers could maintain them entire without becoming separated from the beliefs of their time. Here, the double-sidedness of syncretism came into play. While on the one hand it tended to dissolve the old forms of belief through pro- gressive spiritualization, on the other hand it did not reject those forms and so did not overcome them. The old forms retained all their attractiveness for the masses. In their favour was the quality of immediacy, and the people wanted firm, tangible forms. They were not able to comprehend the broadening and spiritu- alization of the conception of god; to them this may have seemed to ren- der that conception evanescent, to empty it of what mattered to them. In this way the beliefs of the "knowledgeable" and of the people came in- creasingly to part company, even though syncretism's broad receptiveness encompassed both groups. There had doubtless always been a tension be- tween them, but now it became stronger and led almost to schism. This was a fateful development: left to itself and separated from the spiritual life of the time, popular belief now sank ever further into narrowness and delusion. Worship of popular gods proliferated; yet these were no more than intermediate beings of a type that always surfaces when the gods themselves become remote from straightforward pious people. The re- course to sacred animals also belongs in this context. Here official religion came together with folk beliefs, and may for that reason have encouraged the tendency. But this commonality of interest was itself deceptive, since its basis was purely formal. For in the animals worshipped by the masses, the learned saw only a symbol that pointed toward "eternal ideas" (idéal áiôíai: Celsus in Origen, Contra Celsum hi: 19). The Egyptians did not take cognizance of this discrepancy, because they were too much at ease with the shifting attitudes of syncretism, which encompassed the most var- ied individual modes of apprehension even within a single person's soul. That is why victory went in the end to folk beliefs. To maintain the spiri- tualized, universal idea of god in the face of the complex intertwinings of polytheistic reality required a measure of maturity and mental discipline that the weakening culture of the latest periods was not able to muster. In this way, syncretism became answerable for the destiny of its part of Egyptian religion. It had led the religion to its peak, and it sealed its subsequent descent. As its nature was double-sided, so was its effect.</page></plain_text>
