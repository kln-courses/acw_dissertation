<plain_text><page sequence="1">INSIDE THE SUN PYRAMID AT TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO: 2008-2011 EXCAVATIONS AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS Nawa Sugiyama, Saburo Sugiyama, and Alejandro Sarabia G. After more than a century of explorations at the Sun Pyramid in Teotihuacan, many uncertainties about the function, mean ing, chronology, and use of the monument remain unresolved. Here we present preliminary results from excavations and mapping conducted by the Sun Pyramid Project to address some of these issues. We focus particularly on describing the architectural features excavated in the interior of the pyramid as well as the subterranean tunnel. This evidence is used to argue that the subterranean structure was artificially constructed for ritual activities, including the placement of royal buri als and/or offerings in its interior. We define three stages in the construction sequence of the Sun Pyramid: (1) a Pre-Sun Pyramid phase, (2) the establishment of the main corpus of the monument, and, finally, (3) the adjoining of the adosada platform. In each phase, we discuss the presence of burials, offerings, or other features uncovered. Furthermore, we pre sent the results of new ceramic and radiocarbon dates that transform our understanding about the construction of the cer emonial center, where the Sun Pyramid and the subterranean tunnel are dated to a later phase than previously thought, from A.D. 170—310 and A.D. 140-240, respectively. Después de más de un siglo de exploraciones en la Pirámide del Sol en Teotihuacan, muchas incógnitas acerca de la función, el simbolismo, la cronología y el uso del monumento permanecen sin resolverse. Aquí presentamos los resultados preliminares de las excavaciones y el mapeo realizados por el Proyecto Pirámide del Sol para desentrañar algunas de estas cuestiones. Nos concentramos particularmente en la descripción de algunos rasgos arquitectónicos excavados en el interior de la pirámide, así como en la estructura subterránea, conocida como la "cueva sagrada," que corre por debajo de dicha pirámide. Uti lizamos esta evidencia para argumentar que la estructura subterránea fue construida artificialmente para actividades rituales, incluyendo la colocación de tumbas reales y/u ofrendas en su interior. Definimos tres etapas en la secuencia constructiva de la Pirámide del Sol incluyendo una fase pre-Pirámide del Sol, el establecimiento del núcleo principal del monumento, y final mente la adición de la plataforma adosada. En cada fase se discute la presencia de entierros, ofrendas u otros rasgos descu biertos . Por otra parte, presentamos los resultados del nuevo fechamiento cerámico y de radiocarbono que transforman nuestra comprensión acerca de la construcción del centro ceremonial. Fechamos la pirámide y el túnel subterráneo para una fase más tardía de lo que se pensaba, 170-310 d.C. y 140-240 d.C. respectivamente.

This floor sat approximately 55 cm above the natural bedrock and was a typical Teotihuacan-style floor prepared with gravel that was smoothed and would have been plastered. It was composed of two flat surfaces that were joined by a sloping step 7 cm in height. It also contained two post holes and a large concentration of carbon that was burnt in situ (Figure 5). There were many microstrata of burnt carbon layers of varying inten sity in this block, and some ceramic fragments were found inside this concentration. Upon abandon ment, the floor was deliberately cut on both ends, and, in particular, we noticed the large concentra tion of broken ceramics and other artifacts deposited just beyond the eastern limit. There is very little we can infer from these features, as we found no associated structure that would have ver ified if this was an interior or exterior surface. The post holes, one round and another square, suggest that they supported poles, but to what purpose is not clear. Similarly, the altitudinal change along the floor surface is puzzling, and no logical functional purpose can be attributed at this point. Based on the high concentration of broken artifacts along the eastern limit, this sequence of events can be inter preted as possibly being part of a termination rit ual or linked to the subsequent construction of the Sun Pyramid. Structure 1 The largest pre-Sun Pyramid structure identified thus far is Structure 1, located at 108 m from the entrance of Noguera's tunnel and only 12 m to the west of the center of the pyramid. This structure, defined by a vertical wall and an associated floor (Floor 1), is characterized by a talud extending from the vertical wall on both sides. At the base of the structure, where the talud connects to the floor, the wall is up to 2 m wide, while the vertical wall measures approximately 90 cm wide (Figure 6). The construction of this wall was first marked by defining two vertical rows of stones that were filled in with mixed stone, bedrock chunks, and dirt to construct the vertical wall. Then the talud surface was attached by filling in the sloping wall at the Figure 5. Floor 2 in Pits 25,29, and 27, with concentrated block of carbon on the floor (photograph by Nawa Sugiyama, © Sun Pyramid Project). base on both sides with dirt and large bedrock chunks that were covered by a prepared gravel and an aplanado finish. This structure was first identified during test pit excavations. This led to our extending the excava tions westward (Pit 18) to characterize the fill of the structure, which to our surprise resulted in the discovery of the western face of the wall. Thus, the second tunnel (Tunnel 2) was dug to the east of Structure 1 to further characterize the wall, partic ularly the dimension and orientation of the struc ture, and to obtain artifacts to date this construction. At a distance of 1.6 m into the tunnel, we suc cessfully exposed the well-preserved eastern face of Structure 1 with its associated floor (Floor 1) and several features of interest. There were two breaks in the wall: (1) at 4.9 m from the entrance of Tun nel 2 where there was a corner, and (2) at 6.4 m where the wall abruptly stopped, only to re-appear at 7.8 m in depth (Figure 6). Finally, at a distance of 12.5 m, the talud base trickled off and could not</page><page sequence="12">414 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 24, No. 4, 2013 22 z 1 ° ¡¡I 15 s UJ "J &gt;- O &lt;n iu .. 2 Z Ü m ^ O o -i -J *l£5 2lSä 2 fc £ 5 lili z z q: to CL &lt; U_ UJ Figure 6.

Profile of Structure 1 at a depth of 12.8 m inside "funnel 2, where the wall ends (photograph by Enrique Pérez, © Sun Pyramid Project). be traced further (Figure 7). At this point, we char acterized the wall of Structure 1 for at least 13.5 m, but we know this structure extends northward for an undetermined length, which remains to be explored. Several preliminary conclusions can be drawn from this excavation. First, this structure was not a filled structure, such as a pyramid or altar, judg ing from its distinct architectural design, which includes a well-finished aplanado surface on the talud and vertical walls on both sides. Second, the size of the structure was substantial, not only because of the length documented so far (13.5 m), but also because of the massiveness of the foun dation with its thick vertical walls. Third, there was at least one corner of a wall that was either an entry way or was later expanded by the continuation of a wall, suggesting a rebuilding phase of Structure 1. Last, this architectural style is unique to Struc ture 1 — unlike other walls with talud and vertical walls finished on both sides, this one did not con tain a narrow flat shoulder where the talud surface joins the vertical wall. All of these conclusions led us to understand Structure 1 as a non-domestic structure that served a public function; it was unique in both dimension and architectural style. Unlike other early structures at Teotihuacan, such as the Pre-Ciudadela structures and Building 1 of the Moon Pyramid that deviated from the later standardized Teotihuacan orientation (Gazzola 2009; Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007), Structure 1 is aligned along the standard Teotihuacan north-south orientation. What is puzzling—similar to the case of the wall consolidated by Millón—is that we found only one wall with these characteristics throughout all the pit and tunnel excavations that had been conducted thus far. This raises several interpretations: it was a free standing wall; the other parallel wall was completely destroyed; the wall stands to the east of Tunnel 1; or, despite the sys tematic sampling, the other side remains unex plored. Although we cannot resolve this issue, we hypothesize that Structure 1 probably delineated a public and/or sacred space. Burial 2 Excavations in Tunnel 2, along with a series of intensive pits dug in the vicinity of Structure 1, led to the discovery of several features, including an offering complex (Offering 1) and three burials. Most of these features probably date to when Struc ture 1 was terminated or cut and were covered to construct the Sun Pyramid. Therefore, they will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent section. However, one burial was found fairly close to Struc ture 1, where we stratigraphically confirmed the antiquity of the burial that pre-dates the construc tion of this structure. The burial was found 106 m from the entrance of Noguera's Tunnel to the west of Structure 1 in Pit 17, named Burial 2.' Burial 2 contained a complete peri natal infant deposited in a flexed position, accompa nied by a small effigy vessel placed near the neck (Figure 8) (Archer 2009). The burial was excavated in the deepest levels, right above the bedrock layer that continues underneath Structure 1.

Burial 2 in Pit 17 (drawing by Jorge Archer, © Sun Pyramid Project). recovered from the systematic test pit excavations and was the phase to which the majority of the offerings and burial complexes dated. All of these features demonstrate that the body of the pyramid was erected during one construction phase. How ever, this was a long process that included the place ment of ritual offerings and burials both in the foundation and in the fill of the structure. Some of these deposits were associated with several pre-Sun Pyramid structures as well as the location of the sacred "cave" that runs underneath the monument. Burial 3 Burial 3 was a secondary burial, placed 110 m from the entrance of Noguera's Tunnel, just to the west of Structure 1. It consisted of a portion of the cra nium (temporal, parietal, frontal, and occipital bones) placed upright inside layer Via, an intrusive, mixed-fill layer above the floor of Structure 1. The bones of this individual were very small and unfused, identifying it as an infant between one and two years of age (Archer 2009). This burial was placed right next to the cut floor associated with Structure 1 when it was being buried to construct the monument. The context and the element dis tribution suggest that this may be a fill inclusion. However, as multiple offerings and burials from the Sun Pyramid are found in the fill, this cranium is associated with a pre-Sun Pyramid structure, and because two other child burials were found in the vicinity, we designate this as a burial. Burial 4 Burial 4, located 101 m from the entrance of Noguera's Tunnel (Pits 22 and 23) (Figure 9), was the only burial that was discovered within a pre pared circular orifice around 70 cm in diameter. This burial was deposited in a sandy layer that cut into the sterile hard stratum just above the bedrock. The cranium presented a tabular-erect cranial defor mation that was slightly altered postmortem due to the weight of the pyramid (Archer 2009). The den tition demonstrated that this individual was between four and six years old. As the burial was uncovered 7 m to the west of Pit 5 where Structure 1 was discovered, it was impossible to directly define the stratigraphic relationship between this burial and Structure 1. However, comparing char acteristics of the soil, we hypothesize that this indi vidual was most likely deposited when this structure was cut, digging the burial pit into older layers (Layers Vb and VI). After deposition, this child was buried with the fill of the Sun Pyramid during its construction. Offering 1 We detected the presence of an offering cache (Offering 1) slightly to the east of Structure 1, placed in the middle of the fill that covered the structure entirely to construct the Sun Pyramid. Offering 1 was located in Tunnel 2, between .9 and 1.4 m from its entrance (southern profile of Pit 4). The materials offered included several obsidian blades, a large marine conch shell, a group of pro jectile points of various sizes, one pyrite disk, a large quantity of organic materials, and an obsid ian anthropomorphic figurine. Underneath the disk, abundant organic materials were carefully laid out.
