Cross's passion for investigating the nature of things (animal, ^?J???^r^ vegetable, and mineral), places, and events as well as for re-imagining and jP^^^^ transforming their meanings and qualities has led her to make a very diverse range of work both thematically and in terms of media. Rather than relying on artistic practice to reveal or confirm transcendental truth, Cross seems more interested in affirming that doubt, strangeness, and ambiguity are natural states: '...art is necessary to generate interest in life, it confirms uncertainty.'1 In a conversation between Cross and Marina Warner, the latter suggests that rather than mimicking the Enlightenment project of trying to 'replace fear with knowledge' artistic inquiry results in 'an illumination of fantasy and feeling.'2 This has a certain resonance with Cross's work which often defies our con ventional sense of logic and requires a wholly imaginative response that is both intellectual and emotional. Cross is perhaps best known for showing familiar things in a different or strange form; for example, the bodies of work created from cows' hides and udders, snakes, and both industrial and domestic detritus. This method of working is indebted to Duchamp and the surrealists and many of the ambiguities and tensions in the work were the result of the transformations enacted upon the objects; be it through witty and unusual juxtapositions (a cow's teat and a stiletto) (Fig 2) or the unexpected re-positioning of things (nipples on a hard hat, or snakes on a gallows). Her work has played with the social meaning of objects and animals and confounded the day-to-day associations and functions of ordinary entities, creating artworks that are poignant, beautiful, witty, and sometimes unnerving. In recent years her practice has moved into new territory; Cross appears to have developed new methods to accompany the old (embracing the use of video) and she has gravitated towards objects and subjects that have an inherent ambiguity; towards 'things' that are 'naturally' unusual or strange. Her practice still often relies on the representation of familiar 'things' in a new light but in general her latest approach seems closer to a raw 1 (Opposite). Dorothy Cross: Jellyfish, 2002.

CROSSING THE GREAT DIVIDE documentation of uncertainty than to the surreal transformations of earlier work. This way of working is apparent in recent pieces: Eyemaker (Fig 3) shows a very unusual craftsman at work, meticulously fashioning a glass eye. At times beautiful and at times grossly distended, the eye slowly takes shape only to be quite shockingly destroyed before we have the pleasure of admiring its finished perfection. Used to satisfy the aesthetic sensibilities of the owner and onlookers, the purely cosmetic, unseeing eye is destroyed by the same breath that gave it life. The eyemaker cannot restore the gift of vision, only its appearance. Endarken (2000) features the ruin of a country cottage, slowly obliterated by an expanding (computer-generated) black spot. Time erases the past and mean ings associated with places and events alter or are forgotten, the hole both negates and emphasises physicality as in Bible (1995). It is possible that the straightforward presentation of these scenes indicates that Cross is preserving an element of these places and activities from oblivion, but she does it without nostalgia and acknowledges the inevitability of transformation and the instabil ity of meanings. She works with, rather than against, the frag mentary nature of information and memory and relishes rather than fears the unknown. This is most evident in her work Come into the garden Maude (Fig 5) which is the first part of the larger Medusae project. It is a poetic celebration of curiosity and passion and a necessarily sketchy tribute to Maude Delap, an amateur scientist, who, living at the turn of the 19th century on Valentia Island, devoted herself to the study and breeding of jellyfish. In May, her new show, Salve, opens at the Kerlin Gallery, Dublin. Cross came upon the word inlaid in a floorboard in Goethe's house in Weimar; 'Salve' is a word with many meanings: it is a salutation, such as Hail, deriving from the Latin salvere - to be well. It can be an unguent or a remedy for a spiritual disease or sorrow, something that serves to overcome doubt from the Old English s(e)alf - ointment and the German salbe and Dutch zalf. And it can mean to salvage, or to vindicate, or to save an opinion from objection?from the Latin salvar?to save, which is also, the root of salvation. The exhibition will feature a piece of driftwood approximately twelve feet long with the word 'salve' inlaid.</page><page sequence="4">It could be the float that saves the man overboard and is itself salvaged from the sea. Perhaps its presence in the gallery suggests that art can also be a saviour: a means of offering us relief from sorrow, or of reassuring us that doubt is normal, echoing what Cross has said previously: 'For me, art is an adventure that helps me cope with the ridiculous situation of being alive.'3 Or perhaps it simply proposes that art can be a way of greeting the world and other people. Cross's work is never didactic, rather it invites and deliberately cultivates a variety of responses. The show at the Kerlin promises to be the product of a desultory intelligence, somewhat enigmatic, refusing any single reading or narrative that would connect all the pieces. The exhibition will include works that are created from raw materials, transformed-found objects, and video pieces. There are, however, many conceptual and visual connections between the works; the sea, for example, is a preoccupation that runs through many of the pieces. Jellyfish are the latest creatures to arouse Cross's interest: they featured in Come into the Garden Maude and their 'otherness' is the subject of a new video piece and a body of works on paper (Fig 1 ). The jellyfish is the most 'alien' and unfamiliar of all the animals to appear in her work; it appears to be asexual and it can also be deadly. Its eyes (the means of any anthropomorphic identification with an animal), if it has any, are hardly visible and it does not bear a physical resemblance to any other creature. Part of her fascination stems from the fact that the jellyfish not only cannot survive out of water, but that it physically loses its fantastical and graceful form and looks entirely different than when it is in the sea. Most of us only encounter jellyfish as repulsive, gelatinous puddles on the beach. With this in mind and knowing that their bodies are approximately 98% water, Cross placed the jellyfish on sheets of paper; their bulbous, fringed forms have dried out to shiny, brown smudges, some look like blue latex; another has a fish in its guts. Their mostly transparent bodies are reduced to a visceral and del icate residue and are only given structure by the piece of paper. It is akin to a negation of natural history where the understanding of structure, form, and the mechanics of life are sought by dis secting death. Each one will be individually framed in the exhi bition and they will hang as a shoal of 'drawings'; art will return a form of sorts to them, but in an entirely alien environment. In contrast, the video work shows the jellyfish in their natural surroundings. The piece opens with a shot of dozens of small frilly jellyfish; the camera pans to the right and comes upon a naked woman, floating vertically with her face just above the water; shoals of jellyfish bump and brush against her. The human is cast as anonymous subject, as the alien presence meeting the jellyfish skin to skin; it is both beautiful and disturbing, but never surreal. Her hair flowing like the fronds of a sea-creature, her languorous demeanour, and the mesmerising way the mechanical eye of the camera drifts around her creates an air of calm. It is as if she is trying to become invisible, to belong to this alien envi ronment, where she is the odd one out, without being an intruder. The jellyfish are beautiful, strange creatures pulsing and floating through the water. The video has a dream-like quality which, combined with a raw immediacy and simple production values, distances it from the expert 'gaze' of the documentary. There will be some photographs in the exhibition, one show ing a half-submerged swimmer, another a large beautiful close-up of a forehead waved with wrinkles, created, I like to think, by puzzlement, concentration, and surprise, as much as time. A third is of an old woman's face shown behind a mirror that has lost much of its silver backing, so that the bottom half of her face is submerged by one's own. Dorothy Cross's work suggests that we are caught between states, physical and mental, between self and other, between what we know, don't know and can imagine. Rather than trying to domesticate that which is different and unknown, Cross challenges our complacencies and certainties. She values doubt, scepticism, otherness and alterity, over easy truth, essences and sameness. Isabel Nolan is a writer and artist living in Dublin.
