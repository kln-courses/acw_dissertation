<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alan Nadel Wellesley Poets: The Works of Robert Pinsky and Frank Bidart To entitle a book An Explanation of America (1980), as Robert Pinsky has done, would seem to most somewhat risky. How can anyone hope to explain something as vast and diverse as "America"? More risky than this subject matter, however, is Pinsky's approach to it; the truly daring word in the title is not "America" but "explanation." We have simply grown up with the idea that poetry ought not explain. So many of the phrases, mottoes and slogans that have formed the commonplaces of twentieth-century American poetry have conditioned us: "objective correlative," "emotional- intellectual complex felt in an instant of time," "a poem should not mean but be," "no ideas but in things" (no ideas but things, no ideas!). Ever since works like Duchamps's "Nude Descending a Stair" showed us not only that time is a place but also a constantly changing one, modern American poetry has tended not so much to "delight and instruct" as to render- to render "reality" in all its multi-dimensional, synchronic complexity. The rewards of commitment to this phenomenologically complex vision of reality were great: the physical pressure of the modern world and the psychological pressure of the dream world found forms and conventions worthy of their rich incongruities; the poet of mere polish, the writer of academic rules, became transparently inadequate. The critic-as-inter- preter, moreover, became invaluable, for the price of these rewards was clarity. A not unreasonable price, some would contend. Since our world is not "clear," nor are our dreams, drives, perceptions or communications, writing poetry which pretends they are is dishonest. We all, nevertheless, most of the time, make what we call "sense" out of experience, are conscious of life as co- herent and continuous. This consciousness may be the ul- timate self-deception- that out of light packets bombarding our eyes at 186,000 miles-per-second we make vision, and from that vision we sometimes even infer designs. While we practice these self-deceptions at lightning speed, moreover, 311</page><page sequence="2">Alan Nadel we simultaneously consider, evaluate and remember in asso- ciation with our vision, all the while rarely losing track of what we're doing and why. Yet this aspect of reality- the sense we have that it's coherent, the evaluations we make of it and of ourselves in regard to it, the explanations of our world to ourselves which context the disparate- this abstract aspect of human reality, that is clarity, has been much shunned by many modern poets. Two poets, Robert Pinsky and Frank Bidart, give us poetry which runs counter to that tradition, poetry which centers on clarifying, explaining, capturing the experience of the human mind as it fabricates its rationales. Both of these poets, who are close friends, wrote the work I will be dis- cussing while teaching at Wellesley College, and although Bidart was, until recently, only part-time faculty, and Pinsky is now at Berkeley, I still do not think it inappropriate to call them "Wellesley Poets, " i.e., to give the common qualities in their work a place name- arbitrary as that name might be- which suggests separate voices operating within a set of shared aesthetic criteria with traceable antecedents and likely followers. I am suggesting, in other words, that in considering together the work of Pinsky and Bidart we might find the makings of what the more stuffy among us used to call a "school." That school finds antecedents in the work of Frank O'Hara, Elizabeth Bishop and such Robert Lowell poems as "91 Revere Street" and "Skunk Hour." Its emphasis is on cap- turing a state of mind in all the coherence that makes that mind one state and one mind, even when, as Lowell tells us quite lucidly in "Skunk Hour," "my mind's not right." It regards the things of this world not as symbolic, but as provocative and evocative, so that their impact is not instantaneous but increases as they fall beneath the scrutiny of thought and the embrace of emotion. Their poetry tends, therefore, often to develop in a cir- cular or centifiigal pattern, moving from a central figure or sensation, reviewing its perceptions from a wide and wider context. We can see this clearly in Pinsky's first book, Sadness and Happiness (1978), especially in such a poem as "Cere- mony for Any Beginning," which considers the interplay of "soul" and circumstance, represented by the weather ("and the random/ Harpies- mood, circumstance, the laws/ Of 312</page><page sequence="3">biography, chance, physics"). In the first seven-line stanza, the "unseasonable" soul is seen as holding forth against the weather. That soul appears to be synonymous with what might be called a sense of identity, "Eager for form as a renowned/ Pedant, the emperor's man of worth, /Hereditary arbiter of manners," and it is indeed unseasonable. To talk of the "soul" is an out-of-season endeavor in contemporary poetry. Richard Wilbur, we should remember, thought of "Love Calls Us to the Things of this World" as a test to see if he could create a context which would allow him to get away with the word "soul." Pinsky offers no apologetics - "soul" as word /theme frequents his poetry- nor does he rely on a narrowly facile or implicitly stock definition. The poem in fact is about the way the soul (which is our idea of the soul) grows and shrinks, condenses and disperses as we incorporate it into our experience of other phenomena. If in the first stanza it holds forth, seeking form, in the second we see that the quest is paradoxical because "Soul, one's life is one's enemy./ As little children learn, what happens / Takes over, and what you were goes away." "What happens," the weather of our life, its natural de- velopment, deprives the soul of its quest for form. Yet as we step even further back, Pinsky takes us to a point at which this loss of form is not a disappearance or erosion, but a dispersal which is universalizing, found in "sardonic soft / Comments of the weather" which reveals the evidence of a soul in a wrecked house: "The nude wallpaper and the brute/ Intelligence of torn pipes." Thus by the end of the second stanza the soul's quest for form becomes the reader's quest for a soul, which is present even in its absence, a part of the weather which opposes it: Therefore when you marry or build Pray to be untrue to the plain Dominance of your own weather, how it keeps Going even in the woods when not A soul is there, and how it implies Always that separate, cold Splendidness, uncouth and unkind- On chilly, unclouded mornings, Torrential sunlight and moist air, 313 Leafage and solid bark breathing the mist.</page><page sequence="4">Alan Nadel We see then that Pinsky is not ashamed to confront openly the interrelationship between abstract and concrete, to treat abstraction with respect. For if what I have called Wellesley Poetry is about anything, it is about human beings, and Pinsky realizes that reconciling concrete to abstract is the preoccupation of humans; living itself is very much the process of formulating ideas- of excitement, rest, joy, pain, surprise- of seeking or avoiding events we believe will fulfill these ideas, and reflecting afterwards to modify the ideas. This experience of understanding emotions forms the thematic center of Sadness and Happiness, and the thirteen- part title poem captures with powerful sureness that odd human trait of measuring-, experience against the imagined idea of it, expectations against prospects. Pinsky begins, however, by acknowledging the impossibility of such a task. That sadness and happiness . . . have no earthly measure is well known- the surprise is how often it becomes impossible to tell one from the other in memory: the sadness of past failures, the strangely happy - doubtless corrupt - fondling of them. Crude, empty though the terms are, they do organize life: sad American house-hunting couples with kids and small savings visit Model Homes each Sunday for years; humble, they need closet space, closet space to organize life. . . Yet the poem forays through Pinsky's life, attempting exactly that impossible earthly measurement, suggesting a somewhat ironic neo-platonism: the ideal is not discovered through the real, but vice versa: . . . it takes more than eyes to see well anything that is worth 314 loving; that is the sad part, the senses</page><page sequence="5">are not visionary, they can tug downward, even in pure joy - trivial joy, the deep solid crack of the bat. A sandlot home run has led me to clown circling the diamond as though cheered by a make-believe audience of thousands (you, dead poets, friends, old coaches and teachers, everyone I ever knew). . . The swift intrusion of that crack of the bat, the solidity of the image, both defies organization and impels it. Language, too, and art, which organize experience, come under scrutiny, and the measuring devices themselves are measured against the experience that they never perfectly organize, or the idea of that experience which they never perfectly capture. Finally, they all focus on the addressee of the poem, Pinsky's wife, who organizes life for their children with the bedtime game, "Sadness and Happiness" ("can you tell me one sad/ thing that happened today, Can you think /of one happy thing to tell me. . ."). She is thus not completely unlike the sad American couples looking for closet-space - or the author looking for a poem- to organize life. But the source of the potential failure has changed. It is not so much that the earthly measures are inadequate as that, like the sad- ness and happiness, they are temporal. . . . art and life both inconstant mothers, in whose fixed cold bosoms we lie fixed, desperate to devise anything, any sadness or happiness, only to escape the clasped coffinworm truth of eternal art or marmoreal infinite nature, twin stiff destined measures both manifested by my shoes, coated with dust or dew which no 3 1 5 earthly measure will survive .</page><page sequence="6">Alan Nadel Like the soul in the woods "when not a soul is there," the sadness and happiness, too, are finally not overcome but dispersed, become their own manifestations. The dust or dew- obliteration or fertility? sadness or happiness? - different yet similar, prompt a reconsideration of the problem at the outset: "how often it becomes impossible / to tell one from the other in memory." Memory is, however, finally all of human experience: the retained idea and the retainer who conjures with it. If this is true of individuals, then it must also apply to that amalgam of human experience, shared ideas and visions, which we call a nation. To explain America, then, is to conjure with one's ideas of it until the conjurings produce some clarity. In writing "An Explanation of America" (the 55-page title poem of his 6 5 -page second volume), Pinsky commits himself to seeking that kind of clarity. He also commits himself to the concept of audience- "explanation," like all rhetorical modes, implies an audience. The poem is thus addressed to his daughter, and the limitations of the mode provide a means for limiting the subject matter. Although his idea of his daughter is therefore simplifying, it is by no means simple. In the first of the poem's three major parts, Pinsky makes us aware of how close idea is to desire, and the poem begins as a conglomeration of desires. The desired version of his daughter becomes receptor for the America he desires to describe which, in turn, be- comes a nation initially described in terms of its desires. "From the Surface," the second section of Part I, thus begins: "A country is the things it wants to see. / If so, some part of me, though I do not, /Must want to see these things- as if to say": The list which follows describes only the sur- faces, a world seen by the true foreigner (Andy Warhol's ideal citizen, perhaps) who only sees what things are, never what they suggest or mean: I want to see the calf with two heads suckle; I want to see the image of a woman In rapid sequence of transparencies Projected on bright flat surface, conveying The full illusion and effect of motion, In vast, varying scale, with varying focus, Swallow the image of her partner's penis. 316 I want to see enormous colored pictures</page><page sequence="7">Of people with impossible complexions, Dressed, often, in flamboyant clothes, along The roads and fastened to the larger buildings. . . . I want to see the anthropomorphic Animals drawn for children, as represented By people in smiling masks and huge costumes. I want to shake their hands. I want to see Cars crashing; cards with a collie or a pipe And slippers, dry flies, mallards and tennis rackets. . . Later in this section, in that recontemplation, typical of Wellesley Poetry, these surfaces are named- billboard, Disney, Deep Throat- so that we come to understand how much naming represents the desire to possess, how much what one desires from a surface explains that surface: what we call it, what it means to us, and, in its final recontemplation, how it unites with other surfaces through a network of associations, focussed on what we desire others to remember: I want for you to see a "hippie restaurant" And the rock valley where a thousand Mormons Were massacred by other Mormons, dressed As Indians- like the Boston tea- tax rioters Or like the college kids who work for Disney, Showing the people what they want to see. For Pinsky society, therefore, is the community of shared desires, its ideas of sadness and happiness: what is beyond, before or even after the surfaces, rather than beneath them. Part II, "Its Great Emptiness" is about a love of death so universal that in explaining America Pinsky can appro- priately devote a section to translating a Horace epistle and another to commenting on Horace and that epistle. This provides a perspective for pondering the desires Pinsky has for his daughter, given that, as Horace explains, "'Death is the chalk-line towards which all things race/" This middle part of the poem brilliantly interweaves image and idea, biography, literature, translation and literary criticism (criticism of the sort that might make Lionel Trilling happy) in one perfectly clear voice. It displays Pinsky at his best, 317</page><page sequence="8">Alan Nadel resolving a range of human potential- unavoidably defined historically- on the small plot of desires for his daughter's necessarily terminal future. From this narrowing of focus comes an expansion of vision. Within the limits established by that chalk-line, we are given Part III, "Its Everlasting Possibility," which is the hope and fear of a parent, both narrowed and univer- salized. Pinsky's poetry, then, despite its ambitious expanse, is his deeply personal attempt to organize as a shore against the uncertainty of life, its existence always on the precipice of disruption or violence. This attempt and the solace we get from it, then, is for Pinsky the activity of the imagination, which knows that, despite uncertainties, there is a future to be conjured, the proof of which is children who evoke our desires for them; like art, they lure the imagination beyond the limits of the merely temporal. Part of the richness of Pinsky's poetry comes from the way it reincorporates its images and motifs, so that the reader almost experiences the recognition and satisfaction of an Odysseus returning home to put his world in order, tidy his realm and clarify its politics. Such is the contemplative wisdom of Pinsky's work. Like Pinsky, Frank Bidart is concerned with the mind reviewing phenomena, but the review is more often an act of obsession than of contemplation, and the effects are startling in the way they compel the reader to involve himself in making things clear. His poems demand that we put things in order; they challenge us to explain ourselves. The dominating sensibility is one of faith in the idea that nothing is so out of control that we can call it uncaused. No matter how horrible, how ugly, how seemingly random anything appears, Bidart has the courage not to allow it to be dismissed as simply random, or as - perhaps even more terrifying- an act of the willful imagination transcending circumstance. No: the circum- stances are always there, and he winds in on them, so that the effect is like the descent from the head down the threads of a wood screw, moving concentrically in on the sharp cutting points of cause. Like Pinsky, in other words, Bidart needs to organize life; and hell, for Bidart, is seeing it disconnected. If reality sometimes appears a heap of broken images, then, implicity, the function of Bidart's poetry is to fill in the gaps, make the connections, find the missing 318 explanations.</page><page sequence="9">In "To My Father" (Golden State, 1973), looking at his father's possessions, Bidart articulates one of the implicit premises of his poetic world, that the possessions were saying "the name /of the man who had chosen them, owned them, / ordered, arranged them, their deceased cause, /the secret pattern that made these things order." This principle applies equally to Herbert White, the murdering, necrophilic child- molester, whose monologue confession forms the opening of Golden State: -You see, ever since I was a kid I wanted to feel things make sense: I remember looking out the window of my room back home, - and being almost suffocated by the asphalt; and grass; and trees; and glass; just there, just there, doing nothing! not saying anything! filling me up- but also being a wall; dead, and stopping me; - how I wanted to see beneath it, cut beneath it, and make it somehow, come alive. . . These passages from both poems suggest that the human being does not exist either anonymously or solipsistically. Rather his existence is defined by his relationship with people and with things. Explaining this relationship is thus his way of defining himself. Herbert White's confession ends: - Hell came when I saw MYSELF. . . and couldn't stand what I see. . . It is followed by a shorter poem, "Self-Portrait, 1969," which Bidart concludes by asking unflinchingly of himself: "What reaches him except disaster?" These poems form the entire Part I of Golden State and precede the long, autobio- graphical middle part that deals largely with Bidart's relation- 319</page><page sequence="10">Alan Nadel ship with his parents. By framing his own confession with that of Herbert White's and using both to frame his auto- biographical poems- which often contain scenes or images echoing White's- Bidart raises the question of whether we are not all our own child molesters, i.e., the molesters of our own childhood, but preferring to see ourselves as the child rather than the molester. Bidart thus tries to take responsibility for that molestation as if the responsibility will purchase clarity, which is his escape from Hell. ("When did I begin to substitute /insight, for prayer?" he asks in section viii of the title poem.) But like measuring sadness and happiness or explaining America, the task is ultimately impossible. Still, within that impossibility, delimited by that Horatian chalk-line, the beginnings of order can be found: I have a friend who says that he has never felt a conflict between something deeply wished or desired, and what he thought was "moral". . . Father, such innocence is surely a kind of Eden- ; but, somehow, I can't regret that we are banished from that company- ; in the awareness, the history of our contradictions and violence, insofar as I am "moral" at all, is the beginning of my moral being. "History" is the operative word here, as it is the operative arbiter in "An Explanation of America," and the influence of Robert Lowell on Wellesley Poetry is evident if we see his wrestling with his Notebook as an attempt to organize his life into the context of History. Although some might contend that Lowell, like Pinsky's sad American couples, needed more closet space to realize his goal, the impulse and direction, nevertheless, are important because they view "history" as a way of organizing the present, not the past; it yields some clarity, consequently, to both and thus helps negotiate the hopes and fears of the necessarily unclear future. History then is a means of transcending the mundane, and for both 320</page><page sequence="11">Pinsky and Bidart it, rather than Heaven, is the realm in which the soul is free. As Book of the Body (1977), Bidart's second volume, makes clear, his world too is populated with lost souls seeking identity as a means of transcendence. For them, painfully and grotesquely, "what happens" has taken over. What Pinsky called "the random Harpies" (mood, circumstance, the laws of biography, chance, physics) become for one of Bidart's per- sonae- a young man who has lost his arm in a car accident- Sex. Identity. History. Family. Affection. Obsession. Chance. - the seven Deadly Sins, spirit implicating itself in matter, only able to know itself by what it has done in Time . . . The population of Book of the Body struggles to escape those implications, but the irony is that, at best, they only manage to escape the body which merely represents the sins by bearing their marks. The poetry explores those at- tempted escapes, trying to give them some clarity while asserting repeatedly that reality is in the mind which conjures with it. The elegy for Bidart's mother, for instance, which incorporates elegies for her dog, her mother, and his father, ends with a villanelle beginning: "If it resists me, I know it's real- " a friend said. I thought of you. . .When I said, "I feel too much. I can't stand what I feel" I meant, as always, facing you. -You're real; and smile at me no less woundedly, dead. The amputee begins his monologue: When I wake up, I try to convince myself that my arm isn't there- to retain my sanity. Then I try to convince myself it is. 321</page><page sequence="12">Alan Nadel Then he reads the four instructions for maintaining his stump. Instructions "3" and "4" (pertaining to the bandage and the sock, respectively) both contain in capital letters "DO NOT WRING!" - as if a one-armed man could wring anything. Thus, very early in this moderately long poem, we discover the painful limitations not only of the body but of the world which circumscribes it: the loudest instruction for dealing with his deepest personal wound, the scar of his most intimate inadequacy, is the very instruction rendered pointless by that wound. He comes to view his life as an arc stretched between the dates of his birth and his amputation, so that a random bit of history has taken over. He attempts to escape that arc by pretending that he never had an arm but discovers the process of memory- not of his arm but of everything else- precludes maintaining that illusion: I couldn't allow myself to remember the vivid associations which gave dimension to what I touched, saw, smelt,- the resonance of every image I had to try to cut from my brain, it had been felt by someone with two hands and two arms. . . His only solace comes, finally, from a historical viewpoint that allows him transcendence by thinking: how Paris is still the city of Louis XVI and Robespierre, how blood, amputation, and rubble give her dimension, resonance and grace. Ellen West, the woman suffering from anorexia nervosa, whose voice takes us through most of the book's last, long and astonishingly powerful poem, tells us: . . . my true self is thin, all profile and effortless gestures, the sort of blond elegant girl whose body is the image of her soul. 322</page><page sequence="13">Her desire is to oppose the random Harpies, the Deadly Sins, to be her true self, not the soul's container, but the soul itself, hungry for identity but able only to feed its enemy, the body, which is proof positive of the surrender to happenstance. If Ellen West's suicide is the most powerful statement about the limitations imposed by Bidart's "Deadly Sins," "Happy Birthday" is the most poignant: Thirty- three, goodbye- the awe I feel is not that you won't come again, or why- but that I've read the trading-cards: RALPH TEMPLE CYCLIST CHAMPION TRICK RIDER WILLIE HARRADON CYCLIST THE YOUTHFUL PHENOMENON F.F. IVES CYCLIST 100 MILES 6 H. 25 MIN. 30 SEC. - as the fragile metal of their wheels stopped turning, as they took on wives, children, accomplishments, all those predilections which also insisted on ending, they could not tell themselves from what they had done. Terrible to dress in the clothes of a period that must end. They didn't plan it that way - they didn't plan it that way. History- meaningless history, we could say- first provides a context for the limitations of Bidart's life, but it also develops into a place vacated by those who "made" that history as well as those who only watched. It thus becomes impossible 323</page><page sequence="14">Alan Nadel to separate the spectator from the participant; for both, "what happens" takes over and alienates them from their plans, their identities, their souls. The "they" at the end of the poem, in other words, is us, and the "it" is everything. This particularly delicate poem exemplifies Bidart's control of understatement, his eye for the resonant word. The word "period," for instance, could not be more apt, for while it is terrible to dress in the clothes of a period that must end, the word "period" entails ending- no period cannot end. What is genuinely terrible in the statement, therefore, is what is also inevitable by definition. Near the center of Book of the Body resides the title poem, one in which Bidart struggles to identify himself by absenting himself, escaping the limitations of the body which feels: Wanting to cease to feel- ; since 1967, so much blood under the bridge, - the deaths of both my parents, (now that they have no body, only when I have no body can we meet- ) The pun on "nobody" is emphasized by presenting the phrase first with a line-break interrupting, then without. This sug- gests that being nobody means having no body; yet only without that body can he meet his parents, the parents he has so much trouble facing and hearing in the earlier poems. The self, however, is that entity which has limits, and the body is that medium which gives form to those limits, expresses feeling as well as records it, separates the watcher from the watched; it is thus the necessary means to all which is desirable, as well as the necessary obstacle. This paradox becomes the refrain of the poem: "the NO which is YES , the YES which is NO ." "Book of the Body" is followed by "Ellen West" which illustrates the dilemma of seeing only half of the problem and seeking complete escape from the body, just as the opening 324</page><page sequence="15">poem, "The Arc/* indicates the dilemma of a person com- pletely limited by the body's history. Between these extremes reside most readers, along with Bidart, himself, and the book of his body, in qualified affirmation, resilient denial. As my sequential discussion of these books has, I hope, suggested, one more, noticeable trait of Wellesley Poetry is that it manifests an organic approach to the volume. The importance of organization, clarity, and reflection, in other words, is reflected in the approach to each volume not as an anthology, but as a focussed and substantive aesthetic state- ment. I also hope, moreover, that my decision to read these poets in terms of one another hasn't suggested more similarity than is accurate. Although they share similar moral concerns and aesthetic commitments, one would no more confuse Pinsky with Bidart than one would confuse Wordsworth with Coleridge or Eliot with Pound. Both Pinsky and Bidart are strong, unique poetic voices, with discrete bodies of work, no matter how much critics may try to escape this by invoking an historical context. 325</page></plain_text>
