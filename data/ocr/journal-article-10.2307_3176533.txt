Girardot MAX MULLER'S SACRED BOOKS AND THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY PRODUCTION OF THE COMPARATIVE SCIENCE OF RELIGIONS Most of my English critics say "Les Bibles de la humanite ne sont pas amusantes." Certainly not! They are not amusing; on the con- trary, they are the very saddest books to read. But they must be read, they must be meditated on, if we want to know what kind of creature homo sapiens is. (M. MULLER, Letter to E. Renan, April 21, 1883) OUR FATHER WHO ART AT OXFORD Frederick Maximilian Muller (1823-1900), as Tomoko Masuzawa and others have observed, is commonly cited as the father or founder of the academic study of religions.' While in recent years we have become sus- picious of our habitual concern to specify patriarchal progenitors of a discursive tradition (after all, the foundational sources of disciplinary traditions are no less ambiguous than the supposed originary role of certain religious founders), Muller was certainly one of the most noted and influential figures associated with the institutionalized emergence of the "science of religion" or "comparative religions" during the last quar- ter of the nineteenth century. But it is not so much Muller's quasi- foundational or paternal status that is of interest, nor is it a matter of any continued concern with his particular theoretical contributions (we all 1 See Tomoko Masuzawa, In Search of Dreamtime: The Quest for the Origin of Religion (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), pp. 58-61. ? 2002 by The University of Chicago.

To borrow again from Masuzawa, Miller's ongoing significance is not really a result of his actions as a creative high god in relation to the ever-inchoate "origins" of discursive traditions. Rather, in more of the ritual sense of potlatching "Big Men," he contin- ues to claim our attention for the role he played in relation to the chang- ing disciplinary politics of an increasingly professionalized and secular academy in the Victorian era. After all, attending to the institutionalized practices of a discipline, and the sociology of related systems of knowl- edge, is often the most revealing method for getting at the hidden byways of discursive history. Already in the 1870s, Miller was mostly known for being known (and known he was "to the Many," as Vanity Fair in 1875 testified).2 As a corollary to this observation, it may also be said that Miller's accom- plishment in many ways concerns his success in promoting, publishing, and popularizing within academic circles and the larger public a new- more self-consciously comparative and ostensibly less reverent-way of studying the always emotionally and intellectually perplexed subject of religion and religions. Thus Miller may be understood more fully within the lineage of great intellectual entrepreneurs of certain self-proclaimed comparative ways of knowing the Oriental languages and civilizations that achieved for the first time an institutional preferment within the changing and increasingly internationalized and imperialistic academic institutions of the Western world. These institutions embraced both the changing nature of universities and the creation of international con- gresses devoted to various newly conceived and professionalized disci- plines-for example, in 1873, self-styled "Orientalists" began to meet in the great imperial capitals of the Western world; it was somewhat later at the turn of the century that, in emulation of the periodic gatherings of 2 There is no better way to characterize Max MUller's unique significance within Victo- rian intellectual and social circles during the period of the 1870s than to consider his car- icatured image and biography published in the February 6, 1875, issue of the stylish London periodical Vanity Fair. See "Men of the Day.-No. 98. Frederick Maximilian Muller, L.L.D." Vanity Fair (London) (February 6, 1875), p. 75. Honored by governments and national academies, Miller at the age of fifty-one was now, as the title of this series of articles indicates, one of the truly notable "Men of the Day." He had just "concluded his great work, and given to the world the last volume of his 'Rig-Veda-Sanhita' which will remain to all time a monument of his erudition and a storehouse for Sanskrit students" (p. 75). In 1875 he was also publishing the fourth volume (of five) in the first series of his collected essays, Chips from a German Workshop (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1895-1910). Miiller's name was very much in the air due to the seemingly endless stream of his publications (books as well as more ephemeral writings in journals and literary re- views) and because of his well-known, and often controversial, public lectures on the com- parative science of religion. During this period, also, he was notably engaged in a series of public debates with Charles Darwin over the origin of language. Many of these accom- plishments were known only by a few fellow scholars who cared about such arcane mat- ters; but, as Vanity Fair makes clear, Muller was that rare kind of public intellectual in an age of increasing specialization who was truly "known to the Many" (p. 75). 214</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions Orientalists, the first international congress of the history of religions convened in Paris.3 Needless to say, the "international" nature of these meetings was almost entirely a matter of scholars assembled from West- ern nations, with some token provision for representatives from various Oriental traditions (especially those, such as colonial India, strongly influenced by Western standards of scholarship). Muller's influence was, therefore, as much due to his self-cultivated fame, social networking, professorial prestige, business acumen, and political skills as it was to his scholarship (not that these are ever sepa- rate). To understand Miller, and in a larger sense the spirit of academic comparativism in the nineteenth century, requires, therefore, a kind of eth- nography of Victorian cultural productions in relation to the Germanic transformation of the institutions of Anglo-American higher learning. And these considerations in turn call for something like an aesthetics of academic entrepreneurship. Indeed, it might be said that there is as much affinity between Miller's intellectual style and the flamboyant and media- savvy modus operandi of, say, for example, Carl Sagan and Stanley Fish as there is with the more modest and "nice" though no less political and self-interested, influence of Mircea Eliade.4 Muller was in many ways the first "celebrity" academician in an age that was inventing the mass media technology of rapid and all-pervasive cultural mythmaking (i.e., the systems of rapidly expanding periodical literature, the networks of international scholarly congresses, the emergence of academic publish- ing and the creation of massive publishing ventures, the telegraph, steam transportation, and organized public lectures such as the Hibbert and Gif- ford lectureships in Britain, and so on). During the Victorian era, academic institutions throughout the West- ern world became, as one Oxford wag put it, "learning factories" in the mode of German (and to some degree Scottish) professorial "research" 3 The social and cultural development of Orientalism is seen in the newly institutional- ized convocations, or multinational congresses, of Orientalists that were appearing for the first time in the 1870s. There were ten other congresses down to the turn of the century: the Third was in St. Petersburg, the Fourth in Florence, the Fifth in Berlin, the Sixth in Leiden, the Seventh in Vienna, the Eighth in Stockholm, the Ninth again in London, the Tenth in Geneva, the Eleventh again in Paris, and the Twelfth in Rome. Muller was either actively present (often as section head or as overall president) or indirectly influential in all of these congresses. There are published proceedings for all of these congresses (a complete set is available at the New York Public Library). These meetings manifest not only the growing internationalism of Western scholarship but, as seen in the pecking order of cities that hosted these congresses, the political and intellectual lines of force among the different European nations. 4 On Eliade's "niceness" see N. J. Girardot, "Smiles and Whispers" in Changing Reli- gious Worlds: The Meaning and End of Mircea Eliade, ed. Bryan Rennie (Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 2001), pp. 143-64.

Myriad new "savage" and "oriental" worlds were being in- tellectually classified, conquered, and colonized as an integral part of the larger imperialistic, religious, and commercial mission of the most pow- erful Western nations-especially Great Britain-toward the end of the nineteenth century, when Carlylian gusts of Germanic higher learning were transforming British intellectual life. Regarding English higher education, the 1870s were not only a watershed period for the emergence of various new "human sciences" but were also years that witnessed a profound transformation of the institutions charged with the accumula- tion and distribution of knowledge. To take Oxford as one important example, there was a dramatic passage from the restrictive Anglican clerical, classical, and upper-class trappings of traditional education to a newly liberalized, nationalistic, competitive, and middle-class professo- rial system focused not so much on the character development of under- graduates but on Wissenschaftlich graduate research, the "knowledge for knowledge's sake" amassing of intellectual capital, and the establishment of institutional prestige and personal aggrandizement.5 At Oxford, uni- versity professors, as distinct from the traditional celibate "dons" se- 5 For many of these issues, see Norman J. Girardot, The Victorian Translation of China: James Legge's Oriental Pilgrimage (Berkeley: University of California Press, in press). The Oxford inauguration of Miller in 1868 as the new chair of comparative philology is a specific manifestation of the larger revolutions in the intellectual and social institutions of Western academic life. Miller's philological Orientalism, together with his new com- parative "science of religions," can therefore be associated with the emergence of a new constellation of disciplines and curricula at the end of the Victorian era (i.e., the natural sciences along with the linguistic and historiographic "human sciences"). For a general discussion of these factors within British higher education in the nineteenth century, see T. W. Heyck, The Transformations of Intellectual Life in Victorian England (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1982). As Heyck shows, professionalism implies a kind of middle-class culture of achievement-i.e., a way of structuring society in relation to the values of pro- gressively moving up in one's professional career. See also the discussion that Charles Der- ber, William Schwartz, and Yale Magrass note in their Power in the Highest Degree, Professionals and the Rise of a New Mandarin Order (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990). These notions of "pure research" and "science" (whether natural or historiographic in form) were often antagonistic to the traditional pedagogy in the Oxford colleges. At the same time, these new ideas about the method and meaning of knowledge were rhetorically aligned with the old Oxford system of "liberal education" (traditionally referring to a cur- riculum focused on the study of the Mediterranean classical tradition) and competitive ex- aminations (which privileged rote memorization and the facile translation of the Latin and Greek classics to and from English). Social barriers were in this way redrawn along class lines that united the "amateur scholars" of the gentry with the newly emerging "profes- sional men" of the middle classes. Boundaries were therefore "drawn between technology, with its artisan and commercial connotations, and the concept of 'pure' science as a pursuit fitted, like Latin and Greek, to train the minds of gentlemen" for the work of administering an empire (Richard R. Yeo, "Science," in Victorian Britain: An Encyclopedia, ed. Sally Mitchell [New York: Garland, 1988], p. 695). Much of the intellectual and emotional cli- mate in England supporting these changes was a product of an age that, because of its imperialistic ambitions, had to confront the existence, and comparative truth, of other classics, other sacred books, and other strangely parallel worlds and "cultures" that were "ancient," "oriental," or "savage" in nature. More practically speaking, the transformation 216</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions questered in their college gardens, were academic "heroes," transnational "generals," and media "ornaments" whose published research and public visibility brought international fame and advancement to their institu- tions.6 "One of the great charms," as Muller put it, of the new humanistic sciences was that "there is so much to explore, so much to sift, so much to arrange." Moreover, such actions (the ever-busy and competitive ex- ploring, arranging, sifting, classifying, and ordering) always implied in Miiller's formulation of these matters an imperial "will to power" based on the oldest of comparative-martial principles: "divide and conquer [di- vide et impera]."7 "England has proved," trumpets Miller, that "she knows not only how 'to conquer but how to rule." England has "realized, and more than real- ized, the dream of Alexander, the marriage of the East and the West, and has drawn the principle nations of the world together more closely than of scholarship at Oxford was fundamentally related to important changes in English social history as the Oxbridge system of higher education became, often reluctantly, less of an elite clerical finishing school for noble Anglican families and more of a national institu- tion concerned with the training of middle-class professional men from different noncon- forming religious backgrounds. 6 In his inaugural lecture of 1868 that established the new humanistic discipline of com- parative philology at Oxford, Max Muller insightfully noted that the ancient English uni- versities traditionally supplied only what the Empire "expected or demanded." And England, or rather English parents from either an upper- or middle-class background, "did not send their sons to learn Chinese or to study Cornish." There was "no supply where there was no demand" and the "professional element in the university"-"the true repre- sentative of higher learning and independent research"-languished (Max Miller, "Inau- gural Lecture," in Chips, 4:4-5). But it was only after the gradual professionalization of the professorate itself, the self-interested association of university prestige (as distinct from the authority of the colleges and tutors) with illustrious professorial "ornaments," and the grudging acceptance of the new disciplines into the undergraduate examination system that a demand was created for nonclassical subjects and dons. The time had come to sup- port, financially and politically, a new class of professional dons or secular fellows (ibid., 4:5-6). In addition to the promotion of research professorships, Miller proposed the crea- tion of research-oriented "student-fellows" whose work would be "properly organized" as it is "in the Institute of France or in the Academy of Berlin." The endowment of this kind of original research would come from the funds ordinarily used for "prize-fellowships" (ibid., 4:8-10). The new professional class of university "professors" and their deputies- determined in relation to professional credentials and secular scholastic accomplishments rather than celibate status and clerical preferment-will "follow up new lines of study" and "devote [its] energies to work which, from its very nature [i.e. secular or non-clerical], could not be lucrative or even self-supporting." This "class of independent workers" would devote itself to "original research." Research scholarship of this kind would involve not just translation pure and simple or the "acquisition of a scholarlike knowledge of other lan- guages besides Greek and Latin" (as it did for Miller's reputation-making Rig Vedic schol- arship), but, in a higher sense, the preparation of "critical editions of the classics" and, for those not committed to the physical sciences, "fearless" research into "the ancient history of mankind" and a "life-long occupation with the problems of philosophy." Finally, but "not least" these scholars would be concerned with "a real [my emphasis] study of the- ology" or, more accurately, with the "science of religion" (ibid., 4:6). 7 Ibid., 4:41. 217</page><page sequence="6">Max Miller's "Sacred Books" they have ever been before." But, says Miller with typical bombastic crescendo, "to conquer and rule is one thing, to understand" Oriental nations "is quite another."8 Mtiller's whole career tended to show, how- ever, that conquering, ruling, and understanding were quite the same thing. There is always the danger of findings coming from "dabblers, babblers, and half-scholars," but, says Muller, the real "conquests" of oriental knowledge are "massive and safe." All self-sacrificing and hard- working Orientalists have finally shown themselves to be the "bold generals" in the battle for human understanding and unity.9 More effec- tively, aggressively, progressively, and dutifully than the well-meaning but dilettantish churchmen and amateur scholars of old, professional Ori- ental scholars operating with a "comparative spirit" prophetically assist in the creation of what Muller calls the "universal communion of man- kind" under the special "shared blood" leadership of Englishmen, Euro- peans, and Americans.10 It is revealing to see that "comparison" as a discursive methodology is in some ways directly connected with these cultural, rhetorical, and structural changes and represents-somewhat in the mode of Max We- ber's understanding of the Protestant spirit of capitalism-a kind of bourgeois, imperialistic, bureaucratic, and mercantile agenda in the do- main of knowledge.11 The entrepreneurial venture of comparison was as much a way of classifying, controlling, and colonizing other worlds as it was an objective, scientific, or value free enterprise. At bottom were always the dark dictates of desire-the conjoined personal and institu- tional interest in making a significant return on one's intellectual invest- ment. What is evident about the discursive history of the comparative science of "world religions" (as well as, in different ways, the other emergent human sciences) is not only the discipline's underlying "prot- estant" presuppositions (often from a "liberal" Evangelical perspective such as Miller's romantic pietistic, and "broad church" leanings-usu- 8 Max Muller, "Address to the Ninth Congress" (Committee of the Congress, London, 1893), p. 67. 9 Ibid., pp. 65-66. 10 In his conclusion, Muller waxed eloquent regarding the need for a global unity of all religions and nations under the leadership of the English and Americans. Blood being thicker than water, these two great nations must stand "shoulder to shoulder" in the great work of creating for the first time a kind of league of nations, a "great parliament of the world" where the universal communion of mankind comes before party, country, and creed (ibid., p. 13). 11 As Muller proclaimed so boldly to the Congress of Orientalists in London in 1874, the "comparative spirit is the truly scientific spirit" of the age-adding in his unabashedly romantic way, "nay, of all ages!" "All human knowledge," he unhesitatingly asserts, "be- gins with the Two or the Dyad, the comprehension of two single things as one" (Max Miiller, "Address to the Aryan Section," in Second International Congress of Orientalists [London, 1876], p. 184.

A CULTURAL HISTORY OF THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE EAST Within the compass of this short article, I cannot present a complete account of these issues as they relate to Max Muller and his expatriate career at Oxford University during the last half of the nineteenth century. I will, however, focus on Miller's most important entrepreneurial pro- duction in the course of the emergent Victorian discourse about religion and religions-that is, the scholarly and political enterprise associated with the monumental project of translated texts known as The Sacred Books of the East (1879-1910).13 It is, after all, the editorial production of this massive set of fifty volumes, in an age characterized by heroic scholarly productions (one of the most notable projects being the Oxford English Dictionary under the tutelage of James Murray, another evan- gelical "outsider" at Oxford),14 that publicly defines and authoritatively 12 On some of the "protestant" implications of the nineteenth-century study of the "world religions" see, e.g., N. J. Girardot, "'Finding the Way': James Legge and the Vic- torian Invention of Taoism," Religion 29 (1999): 107-21; and Gregory Schopen, "Archae- ology and Protestant Presuppositions in the Study of Indian Buddhism" History of Religions 31 (1991): 1-23. Muller, it is important to note, was at Oxford much closer to Benjamin Jowett's (and Arthur Stanley's) liberal Anglical position than to Mark Pattison's more radical skepticism. Miller's science of language did not "unduly threaten religious faith." See Linda Dowling, Language and Decadence in the Victorian Fin de Sidcle (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1986), p. 68; and, as A. C. De Vooys has said, Muller remained "at heart a believer"-a pietistic and "sentimental Luthern," who, in En- gland, identified with the classy social and intellectual pretensions of Oxonian Broad Church Anglicanism (A. C. De Vooys, Andrew Lang: A Nineteenth Century Anthropolo- gist [1968], p. 86). In all of MUller's publications, there was a kind of religious Kantianism that affirmed the old adage of "nihil in fide quod ante fuerit in sensu" [there is nothing in faith anterior to what is found in the senses]. In E. E. Evans-Pritchard's words (Theories of Primitive Religion [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965]), "Max Miller did not wish to be un- derstood as suggesting that religion began by men deifying grand natural objects, but rather that these gave him a feeling of the Infinite and also served as symbols for it." On the anti-papist element in much of the nineteenth-century study of religion, see especially Jonathan Z. Smith, Drudgery Divine: On the Comparison of Early Christianities and the Religions of Late Antiquity (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990). 13 Max Muller, ed., The Sacred Books of the East (hereafter cited as SBE), 50 vols. (Ox- ford: Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1879-1910). 14 The increasing presence of nonconforming scholars like Murray and James Legge (after 1870) and non-Anglican colleges such as Mansfield and Manchester, the influence of liberally evangelical or "Broad Church" Anglican academics such as Miller and Benjamin Jowett, and the gradual tempering of sectarian dissonance at Oxford-as well as, of course, the growing secular and "agnostic" climate in academic circles-played an impor- tant role in furthering the study of Oriental languages and in introducing the study of com- parative religions into the course of studies in English higher education. See J. S. Reynolds, 219</page><page sequence="8">Max Miller's "Sacred Books" establishes the new comparative science of religion at the end of the cen- tury. In fact, the canonical authority of the Sacred Books in establishing the new discursive tradition is directly connected with Muller's editor- ship and his understanding of the scriptural "sacredness" of the Oriental texts included in the series (for Miller's definition of "sacred books" see below)-that is to say, the published set of The Sacred Books of the East both defined and, by virtue of its editorial production, publication, distri- bution, and "set apart" prestige, manifested its own special discursive sacrality. These texts, more than any other single undertaking (with the partial exception of James Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics [Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1908-21]), ratify a whole taken-for-granted taxonomy of concepts, categories, and procedures that will characterize the academic study of religion well into the twentieth century (e.g., the interrelated ideas and "relentless textuality" of sacred books and a par- ticular grouping of "world religions"15 a concern for the importance and authority of the earliest written scriptures of a tradition if not the tradi- tion's ultimate origins, the developmental interplay between doctrinal moral purity and ritualized priestly corruption, natural revelation and the Hegelian unfolding of the "higher," "universal" or "essential" nature of the spirit of religion, and so on; see below). One way to tease out some of the discursive linkages suggested above is to examine the cultural and material history of particular intellec- tual products such as the Sacred Books, especially to pay as much atten- tion to the cultural, social, rhetorical, and institutional context of these works as to their particular theoretical content. In this sense, for ex- ample, the history of the Oxford University Press and the culture of aca- "The Evangelicals at Oxford 1735-1871, A Record of an Unchronicled Movement with the Record Extended to 1905" in The Evangelicals at Oxford (Appelford: Marcham Manor Press, 1975). As Reynolds notes (pp. 30-31), evangelicals at Oxford had a special affinity for Oriental learning (e.g., the Arabists Macbride, Gandell, and David Mar- goliouth; the Syriac scholar Payne Smith; Legge for Chinese; and Monier Williams for Sanskrit). Especially important with regard to the curricular introduction of comparative religions were Principal A. M. Fairbairn at the Congregationalist Mansfield College and John Estlin Carpenter, who was based at the Unitarian Manchester College (opening a few years after Mansfield College and located only a stone's throw away from the Congre- gationalist institution). For all his glory as the reputed father of the comparative science of religions, Miiller seems rarely, if ever, to have taught the subject in any extensive way at Oxford (one minor exception to this was Miller's presidential talk given in the early 1890s for the Oxford Society of Historical Theology. See Max Muller, "On the Proper Use of Holy Scriptures," President's Address, annual meeting of the Oxford Society of Historical Theology, Oxford, November 23, 1893 in Abstracts of the Society of Historical Theology [1894], pp. 5-26). 15 See James Hastings, ed., The Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, 12 vols. (Edin- burgh, 1908-21). On the contested category of the "world religions," see the discussion by Tomoko Masuzawa, "The Question of Universality: Counting the 'World Religions' in the Nineteenth Century," in Second Annual Robert C. Lester Lecture (Boulder: University of Colorado, 2000). 220</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions demic publishing,16 as related to the changing nature of the larger university, is as important as Muller's various theories or the biographi- cal details of Miiller's incredibly busy life as an All Souls luminary, influential professor of comparative philology, famous Orientalist, popu- lar public lecturer, controversial mythographer, combative intellectual debater, and well-connected confidant of royalty. In other words, it is often as important to attend to publishers' archives and contracts, and to 16 Aside from Miller's "preface" to the first volume of the Sacred Books and the discus- sion in his "Lectures on the Science of Religion" (as well as one or two other articles di- rectly addressing the question of the "sacred books"), there are few extended discussions of the rationale for, and process of, producing the series in Miller's extant public or private papers. Furthermore, nineteenth-century publishing records are notoriously spotty. Thus, the Oxford University Press (OUP) Archive has only recently been professionalized. Years of relative neglect have unfortunately taken their toll on the existence and condition of ma- terial. The records pertinent to Miiller are extensive, but incomplete. There is, for example, a separate file on the Sacred Books and for Miiller, and each of these along with the ma- terial in the Letter Books (hereafter cited as L.B.), preserves valuable but sparse material. The Sacred Books file, in particular, is disappointing in this regard. There are, however, a number of important items relating to Miller's working relation with his contributors (e.g., a printed circular titled "Regulations agreed upon between the Editor and Contributors to the Sacred Books of the East," and in the Bodleian archives [Ms. Eng. d. 2356] handwrit- ten notes by Miller concerning his publishing agreement with OUP [especially concerning the terms of his payment]) and various documents concerning the sales of the series (but only for the years 1887-1908). Also interesting, and sometimes revealing (though terse), are the many copies of individual letters by Miller to the secretaries of the OUP found in the extant Letter Books. Another problem with writing the history of the Sacred Books as a cultural artifact is indicated by the fact that it is not at all clear when Miller first con- ceived of the idea for such a project or when the series was finally approved by OUP. Miiller's idea for such an undertaking, a work that he will call the "opus magnum" of his later life, most certainly came into being in the early 1870s, a time when he was still smart- ing from the humiliation of being denied the Boden chair of Sanskrit and was taking only partial consolation in his position as professor of comparative philology. MUller refers to the project as his "opus magnum" in a letter to Georg Von Bunsen, dated January 1, 1876. See Georgina A. Miiller, The Life and Letters of the Right Honorable Friedrich Max Miiller (hereafter cited as LLMM), 2 vols. (London, 1902), 2:1. From this letter it is also clear that, at the time of his threatened leave of Oxford, Miiller was using the "Bibliotheca Sacra" as an enticement in his negotiations with German universities for a position. The OUP Archives (i.e., contained in the separate SBE files) have no documents specifically re- lating to the approval and delegate vote on the Sacred Books. Based on my discussion of Oxford machinations involving Miiller's threatened departure, it seems probable that official Press approval for the Sacred Books came toward the end of 1875. Final university ratification, under Liddell's guidance, seems to have come only at the start of 1876 when Miiller, under the new terms of his position, was finally convinced to stay on at Oxford to work on the Sacred Books. This chronology is corroborated by a letter to the editor of the London Times, dated February 14, 1876, which notes that "Professor Max Miiller has un- dertaken to edit for the University Press all the sacred books of the world, except the Bible and the Chinese scriptures, which will be allotted to the eminent Sinologue, Dr. Legge." This correspondence (identified only as "Bibliophilus"), it is worth noting, was especially concerned that "the cost of printing the gigantic series would soon drain the Univer- sity Press of its last penny, and absorb the rich endowments of all the Colleges. Instead of securing for Oxford the magnificent future predicted in the Academy as the result of this measure, it would, unless the programme were considerably reduced in its dimensions, in- volve the University in speedy bankruptcy." 221</page><page sequence="10">Max Miiller's "Sacred Books" know how much Muller was paid as an Oxford professor and Hibbert lecturer (or how little actual teaching he did in relation to his "higher" chores as a research scholar, editor of heroic publishing ventures, and captain of the international Orientalist enterprise),17 as it is to parse his inimitable rhetoric. Most of all, Muller must be identified with his inde- fatigable production (as author and editor) of many books ("all in all, he wrote and edited more than one hundred books").18 As Vanity Fair noted, he had edited and "written libraries."19 BRITISH ORIENTALISM, THE COMPARATIVE SPIRIT, AND THE SACRED BOOKS In the 1870s, the great metropolis of London was the capital of an un- precedented global empire. In recognition of this power and distinction, the Second Congress of Orientalists was held in London in 1874, an event that signaled, after decades of listless gentlemanly amateurism when compared with the professionalized Oriental scholarship of France (the first Congress was held in Paris in 1873) and Germany, the emer- gence, in both a "practical" and "theoretical" sense, of a newly vigorous British scholarship in Orientalism and other humanistic sciences. Britain was now "distinguished for its extent as well as for its devotion to the 17 Miller preferred the national fame and substantial remuneration that came from pub- lishing books and accepting well-publicized lectureships over the tedium and obscurity of routine teaching. His inclination in these matters was particularly one-sided when it was associated with the special notability of inaugurating a new, and heavily endowed, invi- tational lectureship devoted to an approach to religion largely identified with his own reputation as the preeminent comparative scholar in the world. Such was the case with his acceptance of the inaugural Hibbert Lectures in 1878 and, then in the 1880s, with his acceptance of the invitation to give the first series of the new Gifford Lectures on "Natural Theology" in Glasgow. These lectures were presented as four successive sessions (1889-92) of well-attended and controversial talks on the topic of "Natural, Physical, Anthropological, and Psychological" religion, which in their published form constitute Miiller's culminating statement on religious development. See Max Miiller, Natural Reli- gion (London: Macmillan, 1890), Physical Religion (London: Longmans, Green, 1891), Anthropological Religion (London: Longmans, Green, 1892), and Theosophy; or Psycho- logical Religion (London: Longmans, Green, 1892). The Gifford Lectureships (established as a permanent endowment in each of the Scottish universities) were created in 1888 by Adam Gifford, a distinguished and wealthy senator in the College of Justice in Scotland, whose will stipulated that the lectures were for "promoting, advancing, teaching, and diffusing the study of Natural Theology" in the "widest sense of the term." For Gifford this implied the rejection of any reliance on "special revelation" and that "no religious test of any kind" was to be "prescribed." The lecturers could therefore "be of no religion, or they may be so-called sceptics, or agnostics, or free-thinkers." Most of all, the "study of Natural Theology" stressed the need to study religion scientifically, "like astronomy or chemistry." See Morris Jastrow, The Study of Religion (London: W. Scott, 1901; reprint, Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1981), p. 51. 18 Quoted by Masuzawa (n. 1 above), p. 60, from the article on Miller in Mircea Eli- ade's Encyclopedia of Religion, vol. 10. 19 Vanity Fair (February 6, 1875), p. 75. 222</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions study of the East."20 But why should there be a congress of Orientalists? In his address at the London congress, Miller suggests that the discipline needed to let the general public know that Orientalists were "really doing something"-especially since (and here we see a telling comment on the competitive pathos of the emerging academic culture) there often seemed to be so much "wrangling and ill-natured abuse" at these "scientific tour- naments." Such congresses were platforms that allowed scholars to tell the world what they "have been doing for the world" and, even more im- portant it would seem, "what, in return," Orientalists may "expect the world to do" for them. The great lesson for all to learn from the study of the East is, in Miiller's estimation, the simple and fundamental awareness that, like what was "once learnt in Rome and Athens," there "are other worlds besides our own, that there are other religions, other mythologies, other laws, and that the history of philosophy from Thales to Hegel is not the whole history of human thought." The importance of the East is that in all these subjects, it has "supplied us with parallels, and with all that is implied in parallels, namely, the possibility of comparing, measuring, and understanding."21 The comparative principle, or understanding "by parallels" is, for Miller, the key modality of human knowing. Furthermore, the comparative study of religions, drawing upon the "scientific" linguistic and historiographi- cal principles of comparative philology, was becoming one of the most exciting of the new human sciences. Here Miiller gives one of his fullest definitions of the "comparative spirit," which is the "truly scientific spirit of [the] age, nay of all ages." The reason for this is that "an empirical acquaintance with single facts does not constitute knowledge in the true sense of the word." "All human knowledge," he says, is, in a sense, met- aphorical-that is, it "begins with the Two or the Dyad, the comprehen- sion of two single things as one." He goes on: "as soon as the same fact is repeated, the work of comparison begins, and the first step is made in 20 Samuel Birch, International Congress of Orientalists (London, 1876), pp. 1-4. 21 Miller, "Address to the Aryan Section" (n. 11 above), pp. 183-84. On Miiller's idea of comparison in the new "science of religion" see E. J. Sharpe, Not to Destroy but to Fulfill; The Contribution of J. N. Farquhar to Protestant Missionary Thought in India before 1914 (Lund: Gleerup, 1965), p. 45: "The term 'the science of religion' was coined by Max Miller to describe the comparative method as applied to the study of reli- gions.... Not only is all 'higher knowledge' acquired by comparison; in the field of re- ligion 'he who knows one, knows none.' He drew a sharp distinction between 'comparative theology' (the study of the historical forms of religion) and 'theoretic theology' (philoso- phy of religion and dogmatics), believing only the first of these to be scientifically rele- vant. In the comparative study of religion and theology, all religions must be treated as being on the same footing; it is not permissible to draw distinctions between 'revealed' and 'natural' religion, since that whole complex of problems belong to theoretic theology." As Sharpe says, Miller's view of religion was basically "immanentist and rationalist." 223</page><page sequence="12">Max Miller's "Sacred Books" that wonderful process which we call generalization, and which is at the root of all intellectual knowledge and of all intellectual language." The "primitive process of comparison is repeated again and again" and then, appealing to comparative etymologies as his favorite source for getting at the radical meaning of things, Miller concludes his disserta- tion on the "comparative spirit" by saying that "when we now give the title of Comparative to the highest kind of knowledge in every branch of science, we have only replaced the old word intelligent (i.e. interligent) or inter-twining, by a new and more expressive term, comparative."22 Muller's dramatic pronouncements regarding comparison lead directly to the need for the production of the Sacred Books (and this address seems to be his first public reference to the forthcoming project, here called the "Sacred Books of Mankind").23 Thus he pleads for a "patient 22 Max Miiller, "Address to the Aryam Section," pp. 177-80. This talk is reprinted in Miiller's Chips (n. 2 above), 4:317-58. 23 Miiller had already discussed this kind of project in his remarks in London at the 1874 Congress of Orientalists. Even earlier, Miiller referred to the small "aristocracy" of canon- ical "book religions" in his "Lectures on the Science of Religion" (the particular talk in question being the "Second Lecture" given on February 26, 1870; published in 1873). See Max Miller, Introduction to the Science of Religion (London, 1873), pp. 101-23. While he does not speak of any specific publishing plan, the germ of the project is clearly suggested by the following (pp. 106-7): "With [the] eight religions the library of the Sacred Books of the whole human race is complete, and an accurate study of these eight codes, written in Sanskrit, Pali, and Zend, in Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic, lastly in Chinese, might in itself not seem too formidable an undertaking for a single scholar. Yet, let us begin at home, and look at the enormous literature devoted to the interpretation of the Old Testament, and the number of books published every year on controverted points in the doctrine or the history of the Gospels, and you may then form an idea of what a theological library would be that should contain the necessary materials for an accurate and scholar-like interpretation of the eight sacred codes." But Miller's address at the 1874 Congress of Orientalists provides us with a crucial clue as to the actual inception of the Sacred Books project, for as he said at that time, "a patient study of the Sacred Scriptures of the world is what is wanted at present more than anything else, in order to clear out ideas of the origin, the nature, and the pur- poses of religion." It is at this point in his talk that he specifically refers to the just pub- lished "Sacred Anthology" by the American Unitarian churchman and gentleman living in London, Moncure Conway (The Sacred Anthology: A Book of Ethnical Scriptures, col- lected and edited by Moncure Conway [London: Triibner &amp; Co., 1873]). The popular suc- cess of this work is indicated by the fact that in 1876 it had already entered into a fifth edition. Miiller would most probably have known of J. P. Guillaume Pauthier's earlier "por- table Asia for the curious" known as Les Livres sacrds de l'Orient (appearing in Paris in 1852; six years later an expanded edition was published called Les Livres sacres de toutes les religions sauf la Bible), and, as Raymond Schwab remarks (The Oriental Renaissance: Europe's Rediscovery of India and the East, 1680-1880, trans. Gene Patterson-Black and Victor Reinking [New York: Columbia University Press, 1984]), Miiller's title was "no doubt" a direct translation from Pauthier. See Schwab, p. 109. See also Louis Jordan, Com- parative Religion: Its Genesis and Growth (Edinburgh: T &amp; T. Clark, 1905), on Pauthier as a precursor of comparative religion in France. But Pauthier's work was done in the nascent years of nineteenth-century French Orientalism and, even though Pauthier was more de- terminedly scholarly than Conway, he was notoriously denounced as an incompetent charlatan by Stanislas Julien and others. There is, in other words, some real plausibility in Conway's claim to have been the immediate catalyst for Miller's Sacred Books. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that Miiller wrote a positive, and quite influential 224</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions study of the sacred scriptures of the world," which will be crucial for clearing up ideas about "the origin, the nature, the true purposes of reli- gion." Most of all, there "can be no science of one religion, but there can be a science of many." Comparison is, then, the secret to the proper study of religion and depends primarily on the translation and availability of sacred books, all of which were written in Oriental languages, except for the Christian scriptures. Crucial to this enterprise is, as Miller says, the "spirit" of "perfect impartiality" directed toward these texts.24 As Miller recognized, this lesson of "impartiality" or "sympathetic comprehensiveness" associated with the "comparative spirit" will dis- quiet many not used to the unsettling truths of "parallels." For the great lesson to be learned is simply that "all religions spring from the same sacred soil, the human heart; that all are quickened by the same divine spirit, the still small voice." Finally, even though the external forms of religion may "change, may wither and decay, yet, as long as man is what he is and what he has been, he will postulate again and again the Infinite as the very condition of the Finite."25 Here we see encapsulated many of Miller's characteristic rhetorical flourishes, theoretical presuppositions, ritual ploys, and political concerns that, in the final analysis, constitute a hardly impartial rationale for his campaign to secure the support of the Oxford University Press in the gigantic undertaking of the Sacred Books. THE PRODUCTION OF THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE EAST The first three volumes of the Sacred Books were published in 1879 (these included Miiller's own translation of selected Upanishads as the review of The Sacred Anthology for the Academy. See Max Miller, "Review of The Sa- cred Anthology: A Book of Ethnical Scriptures," collected and edited by M. D. Conway, Academy 67 (October 31, 1874): 476-77. This review almost reads as a preliminary brief for his own proposal (as was his address the year earlier to the Congress of Orientalists), titled a "Program of Translation of the Sacred Books of the East" in his preface to volume 1 of the Sacred Books, to the Oxford University Press (though undated, Miller's prospec- tus was clearly written sometime shortly after this review, that is, late 1874 or early in 1875). As Miller says, the incredible response to Conway's work illustrating the "sym- pathy of religions" (where "sympathies far outweigh the differences") proves the "wide interest in a subject hitherto strangely neglected." Noting the scholarly deficiencies of Conway's anthology, its "purely practical character" and its tendency to present too much of a "glowing account" of the oriental scriptures, Miller concludes in a way that indicates his own plans to step into the breech: "We trust that his book will arouse a more general interest in a long-neglected and even despised branch of literature, the Sacred Books of the East." See Miiller, "Review of the Sacred Anthology," p. 477. 24 Miller, "Address to the Aryan Section": "The sacred books of the principle religions of mankind had to be placed side by side with perfect impartiality, in order to discern the points which they share in common as well as those that are peculiar to each. The results already obtained by this simple juxtaposition are full of important lessons, and the fact that the truths on which all religions agree far exceed those on which they differ, has hardly been sufficiently appreciated" (p. 349). 25 Ibid., p. 185. 225</page><page sequence="14">Max Muller's "Sacred Books" first volume, along with Georg Biihler's second volume translation of the Sacred Laws of the Aryas and James Legge's third volume of Chinese "Sacred Books"-the Books of Documents, Poetry, and Filial Piety),26 but the production of the whole series depended on the financial success 26 Regarding the selection of individual volumes and the relative weighing of the differ- ent "book religions," we need to consider Miller's original plans-in 1876 and in his re- vised 1879 schedule of selections-with respect to the number and type of texts to be included in the series. Concerning the Brahmanical works, Miller remarked that he was independently publishing a scholarly translation of the Rig Vedic hymns so that only a "freer" rendition of selected hymns was required for the Sacred Books. (In addition to his earlier edition of the authoritative text of the Rig Veda, Miller had begun to publish a mul- tivolume translation of the Hymns in a form with copious notes similar to James Legge's Chinese Classics-Rig-veda-sanhita, The Sacred Hymns of the Brahmans, translated and explained, vol. 1, Hymns to the Maruts or the Storm Gods [London, 1869].) Of more con- cern to Miiller was a selection of principal Upanishads that he calls "theosophic treatises of great interest and beauty" ("Preface to the Sacred Books of the East," SBE, 1:xl-xlv). Considering their philosophical and historical importance (in both Indian history and the history of Western Orientalist scholarship), it is not surprising therefore that a collection of the Upanishads became Miiller's initial contribution to the Sacred Books and the very first volume of the series. As spelled out in his revised plan, the Brahmanic texts would also include various law books in prose and poetry and later works like the celebrated Bhagavad-gita and the popular Vayu-purana. Admitting the difficulty of selecting texts from the immensity of Buddhist literature, Miller emphasized the need for works from both the Pali and Sanskrit collections. As noted in his revised plan, these would be supple- mented by some Chinese Mahayana documents. Zoroastrian texts would include the Zend Avesta along with a few Pahlavi and Parsi documents. Jain literature, while outside the scope of the series in 1876, is included in the revised agenda in the form of some selected Prakrit sutras. As for Islam-or "Mohammedanism" as it was often called at that time as a "founded" religion like "Christianity," "Confucianism," or "Buddhism"-"all that is es- sential," says Miiller, is a "trustworthy translation of the Koran" (ibid.). In the culminating set of forty-nine volumes, the Indian religions made up thirty-three volumes-that is, twenty-one Vedic-Brahmanic volumes, two Jain volumes, and ten Buddhist volumes (only one of which, vol. 19, was devoted to a Chinese Buddhist text and two others included Mahayana texts influencing East Asian tradition). To this must be added the eight volumes of Persian or Zoroastrian texts, which gives us a grand total of forty-one out of forty-nine volumes (more or less, depending on how a few of the Buddhist volumes are counted) that could be generally classified as belonging to "Indo-European" tradition. (See A. A. Mac- donell's discussion of some of these figures in his preface to volume 50 of the series, the index volume prepared by M. Winternitz. A former student of Miiller, Macdonell was one of the great Indological Orientalists of his day and a holder of the Boden chair at Oxford. However, even after the turn of the century, he continued the "Indo-European" party line that Sacred Books "include all the most important works of the seven non-Christian reli- gions that have exercised a profound influence on the civilization of the continent of Asia." See SBE [n. 13 above], 50:vii). Weakly trailing along at the end came the two-volume translation of the Islamic Koran and Legge's six volumes devoted to Confucianism and Daoism. Aside from the flagrant slighting of the rich textual heritage of Islam (particularly the Hadith traditions), the most egregious case of shortsightedness concerns the com- pletely inadequate and distorted representation of East Asian religious traditions. As seen from the numerical breakdown of texts, the non-Aryan traditions of Asia receive not only less coverage than the Brahmanical and Buddhist texts but actually less than the Persian Parsi scriptures. Note, for example, the total exclusion of texts referring specifically to Ja- pan, Korea, or to any of the traditions of Southeast Asia and the failure to give any kind of truly balanced selection of East Asian Buddhist texts. The fact that Vajrayana mate- rials were generally excluded is not unexpected given the endemic bias against ritualistic, magical, and "corrupt" traditions. 226</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions of the first twenty-four volumes and the renewal of the series in 1884, culminating with forty-nine volumes at the end of the century (an addi- tional index volume was added in 1910).27 This project, which initially 27 The fiftieth and final volume was a general index to the series, compiled by M. Win- teritz, that appeared ten years after the death of Miiller, Sacred Books of the East, vol. 50. The original agreement with the Clarendon Press of the University called for the comple- tion of a first series of twenty-four volumes in 1884. Inasmuch as the volumes were ap- pearing pretty much on time and because, despite persistent complaints from conservative critics, the series had already won an abundance of praise for Miiller and the Press, there was really very little doubt that a second and final series would be authorized. Miller was always confident that, "if rightly understood," the Sacred Books would be renewed until the end of the century. Furthermore, although subscriptions for the entire set of volumes were relatively few, some individual volumes had sold quite well considering their formi- dable scholastic pedigree ("best-sellers" from the initial series where Miller's volume on the Upanishads, the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, some of the Buddhist Pali volumes, and Legge's Chinese volumes). There are no extant sales figures for the SBE during the late 1870s and early 1880s in the OUP Archive. My estimate of the "best sellers" is based on later end-of-the-century figures in the archives-see "SBE 1887-1908," Packet 41, OUP Archive. "Best-selling" for an expensive scholarly work like the Sacred Books generally seems to have meant around several hundred copies sold per year, sustained over a sub- stantial period of time. The key document in the renewal of the Sacred Books is Miller's 1882 letter to Henry Liddell, dean of Christ Church College at that time, and secretary to the Delegates of the University Press. See Max Miiller to Dean Henry Liddell, 1882, Bodleian Library, Oxford University (BL/OU) (MS Autogr. e. 11, fols. 53-54). Beginning with an account of his "stewardship" of the project, Muller proudly informed the delegates that, despite ongoing difficulties with various contributors and a slow start, the series was basically on schedule. He made it clear that by the end of 1884, "all the great religions of the East" will have been "fairly represented." However, entering into the heart of his ap- peal, he emphasized that twenty-four volumes could not "possibly give an adequate idea even of the more important of the Sacred Books of the East" ("meaning by Sacred Books none but those that have received some kind of canonical sanction"). Miiller then explains his self-styled "courageous" decision to begin the series with the "obscure" and sometimes "repellent" Upanishads. Interestingly, part of his justification is that, because Buddhism was "of late" occupying so much public attention, it was important to make available those texts that "embody the first germs of Buddhism in its historical development out of Brah- manism." He also defensively notes that the reason his translation differed "so widely from previous translations" was "chiefly due" to "keeping [himself] as much as possible inde- pendent of native commentators, who, though indispensable and extremely useful, are so much under the spell of the later systematic Vedanta philosophy, as often to do violence to the simpler thoughts of ancient poets and philosophers." "Among Oriental scholars and students of ancient religions," says Miiller, there "is a general wish that the Series should be continued." The one sensitive issue is, as Miller puts it, that the Sacred Books were not "more attractive and more popular" in nature. Rehearsing his worn and ready arguments from the original prospectus, Miller again rests his case on the scholarly and historical need for publishing "complete" translations that include both the beautiful and the repul- sive. In contrast to the instant gratification sought by vulgar seekers after gems of Oriental wisdom, the scholarly extraction of scattered "nuggets of gold" from the complete Sacred Books will be "all the more precious" precisely because they are "hidden under so much rubbish" and "so much detritus of early thought." The bottom line in Miller's argument is finally the question of the bottom line-that is, the financial status of the series. In this re- gard, Miiller was pleased to note that, although never intended as a "commercial specula- tion," the series so far had enjoyed a financial success sufficient to cover the substantial publishing expenses involved and even (as he was "surprised" to learn) to insure the Press "a fair margin for profit by the sale of copies still on hand." The only sore point indicated is that, while Miller himself was appreciative of the "generous" remuneration given to him as 227</page><page sequence="16">Max Miiller's "Sacred Books" involved a battalion of twenty of the "best" Oriental scholars in the world,28 was not only an enormous editorial undertaking but an expen- sive and apparently risky venture for the Oxford University Press-in fact, a publishing venture that required a whole new category of books at the Press.29 Despite these difficulties, its successful production represents one of the great monuments of Oxford and British tradition in an age known for its vast literary projects.30 Even though the publication of the Sacred Books did not achieve the "Oriental renaissance" that Western civilization hoped for at the begin- editor (apparently around ?200 per annum), he was embarrassed to receive so many com- plaints about the meager honorarium paid to the translators (it appears to have been around ?100 per volume, no matter how much time was involved). See the Bartho- lomew Price letter to James Legge, dated April 19, 1882, which notifies Legge of his pay- ment (?118) for volume 21 of the Sacred Books of the East (the Book of Changes), OUP Archive/L.B. But nothing was ever done to sweeten the financial agreements with the translators in the second series of volumes and the Press was ruthless in docking honorar- iums for corrections made in the page-proofs. See, e.g., the letter from the Press secretary to James Legge, January 30, 1886, OUP Archive/L.B. 39 (concerning corrections of the Book of Changes volume). In Miiller's less-than-humble estimation, there was no conceiv- able reason why the Press should not carry on the work. And given Miller's cozy relation- ship with the Board of Delegates of the Press, his entrepreneurial talents as a career academician, and his prestige as an All Souls' luminary, there is every reason to believe that there was very little suspense about the final, and very affirmative, decision. 28 The original contingent of scholars included German and other continental scholars, along with some British scholars and a few token Indian scholars-such as R. G. Bhan- darkar, who never completed his contribution, and Kashinath Trimbek Telang, who con- tributed volume 8 on the Bhagavadgita; in the second series of volumes, a single Japanese scholar, J. Takakusu, produced volume 49 on Mahayana Buddhism. It is interesting to note that relatively few French scholars were invited to contribute to the Sacred Books. This situation reflects the relative, and temporary, impoverishment of French Orientalism in the last quarter of the nineteenth century (especially in Oriental fields like Sanskrit and Aryan studies where, at this time, the best scholars were either German or English). Miller, Legge, Hermann Oldenberg, and T. W. Rhys Davids each contributed six volumes to the final collection of Sacred Books; Julius Eggerling and E. W. West, with five each, came next in terms of the number of volumes produced. All of this suggests that British schol- arship, especially in the area of Indological Orientalism, finally had been professionalized. On Miller's difficulties as an editor (the enormous correspondence, the dilatoriness and pettiness of the translators, the need for a heavy editing of the translations, etc.)-work continued up to the last months of his life-see LLMM (n. 15 above), 2:9-12. 29 As one of the members of the select Board of Delegates at the Oxford University Press, Miller argued the case with his fellow delegates of the Press, and this seems to be a turning point in the publishing policy of university presses in the English-speaking world, it would be well for Oxford "to draw a line between two classes of books." One category would be those works published for profit as "booksellers"; the other class would be "for the encouragement of scientific works" requiring the special approval and over- sight of the "Delegates of the University Press." This last category of exceptional noncom- mercial works designed for the "advancement of sound learning" would moreover receive a uniquely prestigious imprint as Oxford "Clarendon Press" books. See Max Miller, State- ment to the Delegates of the Oxford University Press, 1878, OUP Archive. 30 The Sacred Books can be equated with several other enormous team efforts involving the Oxford University Press at this time: the new revised translation of the English Bible from original sources (initiated in 1870 at Cambridge University and appearing more than ten years later), Jowett's multivolume edition of the Greek classics, and James Murray's 228</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions ning of the century, it nonetheless promoted the more complete curric- ular acceptance and institutionalization (in different and shifting degrees) of Orientalism, the "science of religion" and the comparative method within the Western academic world.31 As Archibald Sayce, the Oxford Assyriologist, somewhat self-servingly said in a review of the first vol- ume, the publication of the Sacred Books was an event that was truly a "significant sign of the age." At no other time in Britain would it have been possible to study religion with the "dispassionate interest" and com- parative methods of science and to publish the results "at the expense of a University supposed to be the stronghold of narrow orthodoxy."32 At least three of the immense Oxonian publishing projects (the revised edition of the Bible, the Sacred Books, and James Murray's dictionary) reflect an important nineteenth-century shift in the methods of knowing. This change can be characterized as a movement from individual schol- arship to the necessarily cooperative efforts of a team of professional academic scholars (what Muller calls the cooperative method of viribus unitis). Much of this newly bureaucratized and entrepreneurial approach to knowledge was provoked by the loot of empire (new information, texts, and artifacts) flooding into the capitals of the great Western na- tions, especially London, but it also had to do with the growing sense of Dictionary of the English Language (undertaken by Murray in 1878; the first volume ap- peared in 1884, the last in 1928). On the complicated process and controversy over the revision of the English Bible, see David Norton, A History of the Bible as Literature, vol. 2, From 1700 to the Present Day (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993). Concern- ing the Oxford English Dictionary, see Elizabeth Murray, Caught in a Web of Words: James A. H. Murray and the Oxford English Dictionary (New York: Oxford University Press, 1977); and John Willinsky, Empire of Words: The Reign of the OED (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1994). On the Oxford University Press involvement with the Revised Version of the Bible and Murray's dictionary, see Peter Sutcliffe, The Oxford University Press: An Informal History, 1478-1978 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978), pp. 48-50, 54-56. Projects like these (unlike other more commercial non-Oxonian projects such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, John Chambers's Cyclopedia, and Leslie Stephen's Dictionary of National Biography-appearing in sixty-three volumes from 1885 to 1900) may not always realize a profit sufficient to offset the costs of production, but, as Muller told the Delegates of the University Press, such undertakings were wholly justified as cru- cial contributions to the "advancement of sound learning and science," not to mention providing rewarding work for junior scholars beginning their careers.

Important also, of course, was a new system of intellectual distribution and preferment since, as Muller put it, the public needs to know what Orientalists and comparativists are doing and professional scholars need to know "what the world will do for them."33 Just as the Protestant mission to the heathen world was patronizingly distinguished from other more crassly commercial and military operations by its ostensibly more disinterested concern for the moral and religious progress of the "savage" and "oriental" traditions, so also is there a sense in which the increasingly secularized academic establishment maintained the moral integrity of its educational mission by its self-proclaimed devotion to a scholarly agenda requiring interna- tional disciplinary cooperation and gigantic publishing ventures that were theoretically noncommercial in nature. The fact of the matter was that most of these gigantic projects were and are a steady source of income for the Oxford University Press and the university down to the present day (indeed, the Oxford University Press's imperious status as the largest and most lucrative university press in the world is directly re- lated to the financial success and incredible prestige of these nineteenth- century projects-as well as, it should be noted, a tacit understanding that scholarly laborers will forgo a monetary return on their effort and time in the interest of academic prestige and advancement). But it was really only the editor, Muller, who received both fame and a substantial emolument from the Oxford University Press for the Sacred Books project, not the individual authors who were paid a flat amount for each completed page and then were severely docked for any excessive correc- tions to their page proofs.34 Miller's cooperatively produced Sacred Books, like the collective effort to revise the English Bible from original languages, was above all a project that depended upon, and valorized, the craft of translation and the specialized mastery of difficult and obscure written languages. Yet, 33 Max Miller, "Address to the Aryan Section" (n. 11 above), p. 185. 34 Recently (1995) the actual contracts for the Sacred Books have been found, including the handwritten agreement with Muller as editor, dated October 19, 1877, and two printed contracts with Legge (one dated June 22, 1877, for the Books of History and Poetry, and the other dated July 31, 1884, for the Book of Rites) (OUP Archive). From these contracts, we see that Muller received ?2,400 for the first set of twenty-four volumes, and each au- thor received ?4 for "every printed sheet thereof containing sixteen pages" or about ?112 per volume (at an average length of 450 pages). As we know from the figures for profes- sor's salaries at Oxford, these were considerable sums of money at the time. It is also made clear that "if expense of corrections shall exceed on the average of any volume 10 shillings per sheet of sixteen pages the amount of the excess shall be borne by the translator." The first edition of each volume involved a printing of 1,500 copies and "the whole of the profits thereof shall belong to the Delegates." Upon a second and subsequent printing, "four-tenths" of the net profits would be paid "to the translator by whom the volume was prepared, two-tenths to the Editor and four-tenths shall belong to the Delegates." 230</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions these projects implied that translation by itself was mostly a lower-order philological skill (an aspect of the "lower criticism"),35 the fruit of which, no matter how technically accurate and stylistically graceful, only provided for a more accessible compilation of raw texts, data, or facts. In this sense, translations collaboratively marshaled by an astute and well- connected general editor made texts available for the higher critical operations of historical-philological interpretation and decipherment. They provided grist for the hermeneutical mill of comparative analysis that extracted the interstitial or "symbolic" meanings hidden by the husks of individual words. The highest order of scientific Oriental schol- arship ideally involved the personal mastery of the original languages of all the texts one was working with, but, more practically speaking, such philological breadth and skill, even for someone so linguistically gifted as Miller, was impossible. Only those with the higher critical skills of historical analysis and theoretical induction (like Muller, himself, of course) were fully and truly capable of the humanistic science of com- parison. It was, then, the scholarly editor, or the commanding general of the rank and file scholars and translators, who had a special authoritative and "generalizing" power in an age of cooperative scholarship depend- ing on the translation and publication of diverse Oriental texts. In some ways similar to Eliade's general editorship of the Macmillan Encyclope- dia of Religion at the end of the twentieth century, it was Miller's edito- rial prowess as manifest in The Sacred Books of the East project (more so than any of his individually authored works or translations) that summed up for better or worse the accomplishments of the new disci- pline in the nineteenth century. As seen from MUller's address in 1874 (see above), the incredible ex- plosion of information in the nineteenth century regarding new Oriental worlds of meaning called for some appropriate, impartial, and scientific scholarly response. What better reaction than to sift, edit, translate, com- pare, and publish the textual deposits of these strange, though histori- cally important, civilizations. This task took on a special significance and urgency when it was understood that it was only because of the ad- vances of Orientalism at the end of the nineteenth century that an army of scholars could be editorially assembled. As the political, commer- cial, and intellectual ransacking of these new worlds intensified during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the growing scholarly consen- sus coming from the newly professionalized academic fields of Ori- entalism was that, despite superficial appearances, there really was "no distinction in kind" (comparatively speaking) between the Western Bible 35 See, e.g., R. D. Altick's discussion of "lower" and "higher" criticism in Victorian times in his Victorian People and Ideas: A Companion for the Modern Reader of Victorian Literature (London: J. M. Dent, 1973), p. 219. 231</page><page sequence="20">Max Miller's "Sacred Books" and some of the other authoritative religious-moral texts associated with Oriental civilizations like India and China. Most convincing in this re- gard was the scriptural and sacred quality perceived in "Indo-European" texts (even though the textual, or written down, nature of these materials was a relatively late phenomenon in Indian tradition). The hyphenated family linkage between the Indian and European traditions was admit- tedly a theoretical philological construct, but, in time and through the cumulative sanction of scholarly iteration and the broadly distributed publication of Oriental "sacred books," what was "discovered" (or in- vented) as a useful methodological principle became a complexly potent linguistic, historical, and racial "fact" of human nature and religion. "WRITTENNESS" AND SOLA SCRIPTURA Much of the prestige of Sanskritic, Indo-European, or Aryan studies at this time derives from Muller's work on the "original text" of the Rig Veda, the oldest of the Indian Scriptures."36 But Miller's editorial em- phasis on critically capturing, preserving, and canonizing some ancient written-down textuality of the Rig Veda in the amber of his "critical" edition really did violence to the Brahmanical insistence on the oral nature of Vedic tradition. As Wilfred Cantwell Smith has noted, Muller's overall sense of the normativity of "sacred books" and his turning of the "Hindu Veda into a written book is an entrancing instance of nineteenth- century Western cultural imperialism, here quietly imposing the Western sense of 'scripture."'37 The English word "scripture" was used only for the "sacred scripture" of the Old and New Testaments down until the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth-century terms like "scripture"-as well as "sacred writing," "holy book" or even "bible"-were for the first time used in a generic and pluralistic way. As William Graham indicates, it was especially Miller's Sacred Books that sanctioned the notion that many different Oriental texts functioned as "scriptures in ways analo- gous to the Hebrew and Christian bible."38 From Miller's Orientalist perspective, the Vedas were the most an- cient documents of the Indian tradition. Since they possessed "power, authority, unicity, and divine inspiration," they were unmistakably a 36 See esp. Thomas Coburn, "Scripture in India" in Rethinking Scripture: Essays from a Comparative Perspective, ed. Miriam Levering (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989), p. 122. 37 Wilfred Cantwell Smith, "Scripture as Form and Concept," in Levering, ed., p. 35. 38 See William Graham, "Scripture" in Encyclopedia of Religion (hereafter cited as ER), 16 vols., ed. Mircea Eliade (New York: Macmillan, 1986-87). Volume 16 includes an index and "synoptic outline" for the encyclopedia. For a fuller discussion of these issues see Graham's Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987). Graham notes that the shared attributes of "scripture" or "sacred books" were particularly power, authority, unicity, and divine inspiration. 232</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions collection of "holy, "sacred," or "religious" scriptures. This judgment concerning the authentic sacredness or profound religiosity of the Indian "classics" (especially in reference to the philosophical, moral, and spiri- tual "purity" and elevated metaphysics of the later Upanishads, selec- tions from this work making up Muller's very first volume for the Sacred Books) relates in many ways to an imbricated set of Evangelical Protes- tant assumptions about history, religion, and the special authority of scrip- ture (sola scriptura-and Miiller's original pietistic Lutheran roots should be recalled here) and individual moral regeneration.39 In addition to an obvious anti-Catholic perspective on the general history of reli- gions, priests, and ritual, these mostly unspoken criteria included, for Muller, an emphasis on reified religious beliefs, doctrines, and moral codes embedded in scriptures and conscience; a stress on a monotheism (or "henotheism") unsullied by intermediary spiritual beings; the impor- tance of nonpetitionary prayer and worship; the need for a radical spiritual transformation of human nature and an ongoing moral self- cultivation; and the originary inspiration and authoritative role of indi- vidual religious founders, prophets, reformers, and editors. It is interesting that Miller's most explicit criterion for designating something as a sacred book did not depend so much on the book's specific doctrines or on some self-assertion of divine origin or revelation ("it was soon found that very few, if any, of the books themselves put forward that claim"). It was rather a matter of texts that were understood as set apart, canonical, or authoritative by their respective traditions. As Muller says, the "sacred books" were "all those which had been formally recognized by religious communities as constituting the highest author- ity in matters of religion, which had received a kind of canonical sanc- tion, and might therefore be appealed to for deciding any disputed points of faith, morality or ceremonial."40 In other words, the "authoritative sta- tus and normative uses of scripture as a defining characteristic" in the 39 See Graham, Beyond the Written Word. Kendall Folkert notes that "one can read painstakingly the writings of F Max Muller and his collaborators in the Sacred Books of the East without finding any degree of sustained reflection" on the meaning of "scripture" or the "question of sacredness as it applies to 'books'. . . . The existence of 'sacred books' in short, seems to have needed no justification." As Folkert goes on to observe, the Sacred Books basically reveal an a priori notion of scripture based on a Protestant model-a model that is used both to define scripture and to privilege, in the Protestant manner of sola scriptura, a hermeneutical emphasis on the critical study of scriptural texts (and their embedded doctrines) in the overall study of religion. Folkert says that this relates "to gen- eral modes of historiography in Western academic circles" where there is an "unrelenting focus on textual documentation." Moreover, the "Christian, specifically Protestant, fasci- nation with the Bible as a 'sacred book'-a fascination that is actually a dimension of Christian faith itself-provides another of the background sets for the problem of scripture in general." See Kendall Folkert's "Canons of Scripture," in Levering, ed., pp. 171-72, 178. 40 See Levering's discussion of these issues in her introduction to Rethinking Scrip- ture, p. 16. The source of Miiller's quote is not completely identified by Levering. Miller's 233</page><page sequence="22">Max Miller's "Sacred Books" comparative study of religion clearly derive from a Protestant-like "con- cern with the sources of the authority of its tradition and the nature of the normative character of its Scripture."41 There is, of course, an unrecog- nized (and quite Catholic) irony here, since the sacrality of these texts depended on the interpretation of an ancient community or tradition just as the canonical disciplinary significance of Miller's published set of Oriental sacred books rested on a second-order editorial selection, coop- erative interpretation, and dispensation of certain documents. Most of all, ancient books (the "forgotten bibles" of Oriental tradi- tions) count more in understanding the authentic meaning of a religion than the later corruptive actions of persons. As Miller said at the time of the Chicago "parliament of world religions," only verifiably ancient texts have the special originary authority of history and tradition: "in the end what remains of the world of deeds is the world of words, or, as we call it, History." Books thus weigh more than living persons in the his- torical assessment of the "real" or "universal" significance of religions. "No religion," declares Miller, "has ever recognized an authority higher than that of its sacred book, whether for the past or the present or the fu- ture." Miiller says that it was the absence of any appeal to inscribed and tested historical documents, and hence the "impossibility of checking the enthusiastic descriptions of the supreme excellence of every sin- gle religion," that interfered with the "usefulness" of the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago.42 For the first time a strong, historically eviden- tial, case could be made for the comparative study of particular ancient canonical theory of the sacred books is first expressed in his 1870 "Lectures on the Sci- ence of Religion." See Miller, Introduction to the Science of Religion (n. 22 above), pp. 101-23. 41 Miriam Levering, introduction to Rethinking Scripture, p. 10. Levering rightly ob- serves that "a mere statement that normativity characterizes sacred texts leaves undis- lodged many assumptions about the universality of attitudes that are in fact most especially Protestant." 42 See Max Miiller, "Real Significance of the Parliament," The Arena 11 (1894): 1-17. The "real significance" of the Parliament, according to Miiller, was that it called attention to the need for the careful study of the sacred books and the overall history of religions, a pursuit only properly and fully conducted by oriental scholars. Too often, as seen in Chi- cago, the shared emotions of "respectful toleration" toward other religions engendered a false, even gushing, enthusiasm for a religious unity not subject to any certain documen- tary standards of significance. Only the more rigorous translation and comparative analysis of religious scriptures by Orientalists can establish a meaningful historical hierarchy of re- ligious truth. From this higher academic point of view, then, the essential meaning, or "real significance," of a religion was often better understood by an unbelieving scholar versed in the language and ancient holy books of the tradition than by an actual living exponent of the religion ("Real Significance of the Parliament," p. 13). Miller's underlying assumption was that, once historical evidence about religious beliefs and practices was properly as- sembled from the sacred books, it would be possible to prove definitively the actual supe- riority, and higher truth, of one religion over another. Needless to say, this higher, if not final, religion would prove to be a reformed version of Protestant Christianity. 234</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions Oriental texts as not just "classics" like the Greek and Roman texts, but as truly sacred books, scriptures, or bibles.43 A PROSPECTUS FOR THE SACRED BOOKS Miller's prospectus for the Sacred Books-entitled "The Sacred Books of the East, Translated, with Introductions and Notes, By Various Orien- tal Scholars, and Edited by F Max Muller" or the "Program of a Trans- lation," as he called it in the preface to volume 1 of the published series-was dated October 1876 in its printed form as a circular and was used for selling the project to the press, for negotiating with potential translators, and for informing the curious about his scholarly endeav- ors.44 This circular-along with the embryonic comments in the "Intro- duction to the Science of Religion" (1870), the actual preface to the first volume and the address to the 1873 Oriental Congress, and the review of Moncure Conway's Sacred Anthology-are the most important docu- ments for understanding Miiller's original rationale and plan for the first twenty-four volume set of Oriental bibles.45 43 Miller himself makes the distinction between "classics" and "sacred books" in his original prospectus for the Sacred Books: "Neither Greeks, nor Romans, nor Germans, nor Celts, nor Slavs have left us anything that deserves the name of Sacred Books. The Homeric Poems are national Epics, like the Ramayana, and the Nibelunge, and the Homeric Hymns have never received that general recognition or sanction which alone can impart to the po- etical effusions of personal piety the sacred or canonical character which is the distinguish- ing feature of the Vedic Hymns." See Miiller's The Sacred Books of the East, Translated with Introductions and Notes, By Various Oriental Scholars, and Edited by F Max Miller, original four-page printed circular in "SBE 1887-1908," Packet 41, OUP Archive. This also appears in Miiller's "Preface" (n. 26 above), l:xl-xlv. There is a good deal of ambiguity surrounding Miiller's criteria of "sacredness." The word "scripture" was used only for the "sacred scripture" of the Old and New Testaments down till the eighteenth century. Graham notes that the shared attributes of "scripture" or "sacred books" were particularly power, authority, unicity, and divine inspiration. This is, however, not so different than the traits as- sociated with the Greek and Roman "classics." There is consequently another (and mostly unstated) level of distinction that hinges on the degree to which a sacred text harbors a mostly pietistic Protestant doctrinal content (i.e., implicit or explicit monotheistic rev- elation; role of prophets or religious founders; prayerful worship of god; afterlife; moral retribution). Noticeably absent from the criteria for purity and sacredness is any real appre- ciation of ritual and material symbol and the role of priests-all of which are too "Catholic" and developmentally corrupt for Miiller's Protestant sensibilities. 44 The printed circular is found in the "SBE 1887-1908," Packet 41, OUP Archive. This circular is identical with the printed version found in volume 1 of the Sacred Books, except for Miiller's brief introductory comments and an appendix of the scholarly contributors to the first series of twenty-four volumes (set to be completed by 1884) and a list of the works "for the present" selected for translation. 45 Attention should be drawn to Miiller's introductory comments to the version printed in volume 1 of the series (called a "Program of a Translation"). It is in these remarks that Miiller airs his editorial difficulties in securing the best Oriental scholars and in getting his contributors to carry through on their agreements with him. Considering the honor and remuneration involved, the few rules for translators were hardly onerous. See "Regulations agreed upon between the Editor and Contributors to the Sacred Books of the East," in "SBE 235</page><page sequence="24">Max Miiller's "Sacred Books" The argument presented in the prospectus is first of all interesting for its defense of the academic Orientalist proposition originally developed in the "Introduction to the Science of Religion" and in his congress talk. His contention was that, aside from their aesthetic appeal to the dilettante or their theological interest to the missionary (who, like a general, uses them to thoroughly know an enemy; moreover, a missionary may also have a legitimate scholarly or academic interest in such texts, since cer- tainly, as Miller said, he cannot be "converting all day long"), the Sa- cred Books' real importance is to be found in their general character as the "oldest" records marking "the beginning of ... documentary, in op- position to purely traditional, history." In this way, these materials are not only historically valuable for their religious views, but also for their information "on the moral sentiments, the social institutions, [and] the legal maxims of some of the most important nations of antiquity."46 Some nations may have an ancient literature or an oral tradition (such as the national epics of the Greeks or the heroic oral tales of the Celts, Germans, and Slavs), but few have left anything that explicitly "deserves the name of Sacred Books." Thus, the Homeric hymns have no particular sacred or "canonical" national sanction. Moreover, the sacred literature of ancient Roman Italy was more of a "liturgical rather than of a purely religious kind" (taking it for granted that something liturgical or ritualis- tic, as mere actions rather than pure ideas fixed in written words, will necessarily be less than purely-or protestantly-religious). Other an- cient though extinct traditions, like that of the Egyptians and Babylo- nians, may have some literature that merits consideration as authentic "sacred books," but, according to Miller, these traditions were still too imperfectly known to allow for meaningful comparative study.47 Putting aside the Hebrew and Christian scriptures (and he does not ex- plain here why they are excluded, the implication being that his readers do not need to have such an obvious exception spelled out), Miller comes to the conclusion that there are only six "great and original reli- gions which profess to be founded on Sacred Books, and have preserved them in manuscript." These make up what in 1870 Miller called his 1887-1908," Packet 41, OUP Archive. It is not clear whether this list of "Regulations" was in existence for the first series of twenty-four volumes. As he says, recalcitrance, illness, domestic affliction, and "even death" took their toll. The most loyal and faithful of all the contributors, and the only one to make all of the deadlines, was the aged, but always hardy and ever-diligent, James Legge. Miller also faced the additional problem of securing native scholars whose cooperation he "particularly desired to secure." See Miiller, "Preface," l:xxxix. 46 Mtiller, "Sacred Books of the East" prospectus, OUP Archive, p. 1, and "Preface" :xl. 47 Mtiller, "Sacred Books of the East" prospectus, OUP Archive, p. 2, and "Preface" 1:xl-xli. 236</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions "Lectures on the Science of Religion" the small "aristocracy of real book-religions in the history of the world": the religions of the Brahmans and those "founded" religions of "Buddha, Zarathustra, Khung-fu-tze, Lao-tse, and Mohammed."48 Always practical minded, Miiller remarks on how difficult it was to find the funds necessary for his project. Unlike the support for more popular works containing the "gems" of Oriental literature (such as Con- way's Anthology of homiletic "flowerets" from the East), which gave the public what it wanted to hear, Miller's collection of (more or less) "com- plete" sacred books could not count on "a circulation large enough to make it a matter of private enterprise and commercial speculation." The problem was that the inclusion of complete sacred books would not cater to the vulgar taste for pious snippets of Oriental wisdom. The sacred books, while containing much that is beautiful and sublimely gemlike, also include much that is "extremely childish, tedious, if not repulsive." In addition to this, they harbor passages that were blatantly obscene by prim Victorian standards and, as he notes in the extended preface to volume 1, the excision of the sexy bits was the only general exception to his rule of completeness.49 The significance of these Oriental works is entirely academic since "no one but the historian will be able to understand the important lessons which they teach." Because the general educated public will be unable to appreciate such unwieldy and at times licentious texts, it is the task of academic institutions and publishers with the higher academic purpose of advancing research and science to step into the breech and fund these projects. Supporting the publication of collections of exotic Oriental texts can be justified only on scientific grounds that are the same as those of a university when it "recognizes the duty of collecting and exhibiting the Museums the petrifactions of bygone ages, little concerned whether the public admires the beauty of fossilised plants and broken skeletons, 48 Muller, Introduction to the Science of Religion, p. 103. It should be noted that the original printed circular does not make use of the special orthography Muller developed to transliterate Oriental languages; see the principles of transliteration discussed in Muller, "Preface," l:xlviii-lv. Discussing the reasons why Orientalists had not already produced "complete" "trustworthy," and "readable" translations of the major sacred books, Mtiller indicates that one important factor was simply that, in many cases, there was much addi- tional philological work to be done in the "critical restoration of the original texts." Some of the best scholars preferred to wait before indulging in the "mere translation" of com- plete texts. Ever the practical minded intellectual, however, Muller argues for the necessity of scholars, or teams of scholars, making a "certain sacrifice" of their specialized philo- logical researches "to render the general results already obtained accessible to the public at large." See Muller, "Sacred Books of the East" prospectus, OUP Archive, pp. 2-3, and "Preface," l:xlii. 49 Miller, "Preface"' l:xx-xxi. Muller says here that this principle of bowdlerization applied only to the most extreme examples of "coarseness." 237</page><page sequence="26">Max Miiller's "Sacred Books" as long as hard-working students find there some light for reading once more the darker pages in the history of the earth."50 The prospectus concludes with a statement of Muller's specific publi- cation agenda that, at the time he was writing, involved a series of no more than twenty-four volumes to appear over a period of eight years. While his stated intention in the twenty-four volumes was to cover the six book-religions with an eye to the usefulness and completeness of individual texts with as much balance and breadth as possible, it also seems evident that he was consciously creating a plan that would neces- sitate the continuation of the series and the engagement of his editorial services for the rest of the century. Like his argument for "collecting and exhibiting" the sacred books or "broken skeletons" of bygone ages so that "hard-working students" may have something to do, we see that much of the rationale for such noncommercial and strictly "historical" projects concerns the furtherance of academic careers. THE SUBLIME AND THE VULGAR Miller's 1879 "Preface to the Sacred Books of the East" supplements the case for the Sacred Books made in his earlier prospectus. Much of the first part of the preface expands on the rule of completeness and the "more scholarlike" and historical need to include that which is "fresh, natural, simple, beautiful, and true" along with that which con- tains "so much that is not only unmeaning, artificial, and silly, but even hideous and repellent."51 Here he develops an interesting theory of oral and textual transmission designed to answer the perplexing problem of how sacred texts, so full of an authentic "divine afflatus," can have such a "mixed character" of the sublime and the repulsive.52 Miller's expla- nation of the amalgamation of the religiously (and morally) pure and corrupt in authoritative sacred texts was "not entirely to [his] own satisfaction." Having registered this qualification, it is clear that his theory of the gradually corrupted, and periodically reformed, transmis- sion of oral and written tradition is itself made up of a rather awkward mixture of euhemeristic, "disease of language," and "priestly influence" factors-all of which collectively amount to a combined reworking of various Reformation, Enlightenment, and Romantic perspectives on reli- gious development. In the process of the handing down of a tradition, especially by word of mouth or by means of ceremonial acts, there was always the danger of linguistic confusion, forgetfulness of original cir- 50 On the different "classes" of scholarship that a university should support, see Miller's 1868 inaugural address and his argument to the Delegates of the Oxford University Press. 51 Muller, "Preface" (n. 26 above), 1:xii. 52 Ibid. 238</page><page sequence="27">History of Religions cumstances, and the liturgical or priestly valorization of some basically trivial, magical, or superstitious custom.53 What makes Miiller's reflections intriguing is that, while he clearly feels that the "wild confusion of sublime truth with vulgar stupidity" is more of a problem for the Oriental scriptures than for the Jewish and Christian scriptures, there is finally no "distinction in kind." In his emotional conclusion, Muller does not hesitate to suggest that it is ridic- ulous to believe that all Oriental people were "forsaken of God" while Westerners "are His chosen people." "We must not forget," he says, "that there are portions in our own sacred books, too, which many of us would wish to be absent, which, from the earliest ages of Christianity, have been regretted by theologians of undoubted piety, and which often prove a stumbling block to those who have been won over by our missionaries to the simple faith of Christ."54 A PROPER USE OF TRANSLATION The other especially noteworthy aspect of Miller's preface to the Sacred Books is his elaboration of a theory of translation to account for the practical and philosophical problems of "rendering ancient thought into modern speech."55 Muller first cautions his readers about the "difficulties in making a proper use of translations." His concern is to disabuse his audience of the notion that one needed only to read the sacred books in translation "in order to gain an insight into the nature and character of the religions of mankind." Part of this criticism is also directed against the overly hasty methods of amateur philosophers and "anthropologists" (and he was certainly thinking of Edward Tylor here) who, without knowing the languages, believe that they can generally classify all reli- gions after having studied a few savage tribes or having glanced at various traveler and missionary accounts.56 It is best to study the sacred books in their original languages, and to study them with great care. But translations have their place as long as they are approached with a "scholarlike spirit" and an unwillingness to accept too quickly prevailing "general assertions" about this or that Oriental text. Even more important when using translations is the recognition that what looks "at first sight" as completely unintelligible or ridiculous is not necessarily "devoid of all meaning."57 It is not so much that Oriental sacred books possess truth, 53 Ibid., 1:xiii-xvi. 54 Ibid., l:xxxvii-xxxviii. 55 Ibid., l:ix. 56 Ibid., l:xxi. 57 Ibid., 1 :xxiii-xxiv. Muller illustrates this point with reference to the empathy needed to appreciate the legitimate meditative and religious significance of the famous opening of the Chandogya Upanishad, which recommends a "one-pointed" mental concentration on 239</page><page sequence="28">Max Muller's "Sacred Books" but that they display the developmental process in the unfolding of reli- gious truth throughout the nations of the world.58 Miller's final advice concerns the problems of translating an Oriental text, so widely removed from the Victorian age in time and "sphere of thought," in the same way that one would translate "a book written a few years ago in French or German." This is an undertaking that admits of the "most partial success only" even as one's knowledge of the ancient Ori- ental language grows more intimate, but Miller believes that a careful scholar-translator can achieve basically accurate and meaningful results. The real issue for Miller is primarily the stylistic question of whether or not the translator may be permitted to do some violence to the target language "rather than to misrepresent old thoughts by clothing them in words which do not fit them?"59 For seasoned translators like Miller, the answer is assuredly and always a matter of choosing the "smaller evil" when "the choice lay between sacrificing idiom or truth." A reader of the Sacred Books, says Miller, should "not expect too much from a transla- tion." Stylistic problems in translations are finally always semantic prob- lems that should reflect the comparative spirit. As "easy as it might be to render word by word," a translator must therefore focus on the more difficult issue of rendering "thought by thought."60 the syllable "Om"-a notion that would seem mostly absurd or impossible to a Victorian used to constant mental activity. Despite Miller's elaborate defense of the notion that a sensitive interpretation of the sacred books had to look to the meaning often buried in ap- parent unmeaning, some of the early reviews of the first volumes attacked Miller for find- ing merit in the "intrinsic absurdity" and "theosophic trash" of the Upanishads. Miiller's problem in defending the intelligibility of "Om," said the Spectator, was his mistaking of "om-nescience for omniscience." See "Review of volumes I-III of the Sacred Books of the East" Spectator (November 15, 1879). See also Archibald Sayce's much more positive evaluation of these same issues in his review of the first three volumes in Nature (1879). 58 Miller, "Preface" l:xxvi. As Miller says: "Even behind the fantastic and whimsical phraseology of the sacred writings of the Hindus and other Eastern nations, there may be sometimes aspirations after truth which deserve careful consideration from the student of the psychological development and the historical growth of early religious thought, and that after careful sifting, treasures may be found in what at first we may feel inclined to throw away as utterly worthless." 59 Miiller, "Preface," l:xxvi-xxvii. 60 Miiller's reason for not translating Atman by "soul, mind, or spirit" is that it makes "the fundamental mistake of using words which may be predicated, in place of a word which is a subject only, and can never become a predicate." See Miller, "Preface" 1 :xx- viii. Miller illustrates this principle of translation by referring to his adoption of "self and Self" instead of the more usual "soul, mind, or spirit," as terms "least liable to misunder- standing" when translating the key Upanishadic term of Atman. While Miller argues for using the most "adequate" term in English for the Sanskrit whenever possible, he also rec- ommends retaining a Sanskrit word "rather than use a misleading substitute in English" (the example he offers is the word Sat, meaning something like the "subtle essence or root of everything"). The crucial point is that "it would be wrong to smooth down [the] strange- ness [of the Upanishads] by clothing them in language familiar to us, which, because it is familiar, will fail to startle us, and because it fails to startle us, will fail also to set us think- ing." See Miller, "Preface" 1 :xxxii-xxxvi. 240</page><page sequence="29">History of Religions Miiller finally makes it clear that his reflections on translation really amount to an argument for the "comparative spirit" of empathetic com- prehensiveness when acting as a translator of texts, a general editor, or as a reader of translations. The implication is that only by achieving some degree of "thought by thought" empathy, as a translator or reader, for the ideas contained in ancient Oriental texts, is it possible to achieve some real appreciation of the "half-religious" and "half-philosophical" utter- ances found in The Sacred Books of the East. It is not enough to say that such works are simply "strange, or obscure, or mystic," since surely Plato, or Bishop Berkeley, is "strange" until "we have identified our- selves with him." The Sacred Books must be "judged from within," and never from without. It is therefore the original, and often opaque, autho- rial meaning, or essential-symbolic intention, that must be empathetically uncovered or understood (even if it is forever a partial understanding). In accomplishing this, "we need not become Brahmans or Buddhists or Taosze [daoshi ] altogether, but we must for a time, if we wish to under- stand, and still more, if we are bold enough to undertake to translate their doctrines."61 These principles linking translation and comparison might almost be taken as the interpretive credo of the humanistic sciences at the end of the nineteenth century. Translating and understanding strange Oriental texts depends on a new kind of pietistic transcendental faith that im- partially seeks to uncover what is always essentially or symbolically hidden in the words and documents that make up the developmental his- tory of religions-that is, "something that could lift up the human heart from this earth to a higher world, something that could make man feel the omnipresence of a higher Power, something that could make him shrink from evil and incline to good." The lesson here, is that we "must draw in every religion a broad distinction between what is essential and what is not, between the eternal and the temporary, between the divine and the human."62 It is Muller's faith in the symbolic or ideal meaning of the "infinite" hidden in the history of religions (as most reliably discovered in "sacred books") that is central to the application of Muller's comparative science. He therefore declares that he undertook the publication of the Sacred Books in the spirit of St. Augustine who, echoing St. Paul, said "that 61 Muller, "Preface" (n. 26 above), 1:xxxvii. In commencing this most profound trans- formative operation of translation and comparison, Muller says that "We (i.e., the editor, translator, and the reader of translations) cannot separate ourselves from those who be- lieved in these sacred books. There is no specific difference between ourselves and the Brahmins, the Buddhists, the Zoroastrians, or the Taosze. Our Powers of perceiving, of reasoning, and of believing may be more highly developed, but we cannot claim the pos- session of any verifying power or of any power of belief which they did not possess as well." 62 Miiller, "Preface," 1:xxxviii. 241</page><page sequence="30">Max Muller's "Sacred Books" there is no religion without some truth in it." In this way, Muller espe- cially wanted "to make missionaries see that, hidden beneath a fearful amount of rubbish, and worse than rubbish, there are grains of gold to be found in every book that has once been called sacred by human lips." It is this remarkably open-ended belief in the possibility of finding some- thing of value, something of the sacred, some idea of the divine or infinite, in every human tradition, whether Christian, Indian, or Chinese, that constitutes the "still reverent" methodological creed of "real deci- pherers" like Muller. THE PAULINE PARADIGM: A PRESUMPTIVE PREROGATIVE This comparativist creed powerfully expressed the new and more purely academic mission to impartially and scientifically translate, classify, and understand the languages, civilizations, and religions of the world. Yet at the same time-as Muller well knew-this principle represents only a superficially secularized restatement of the biblically sanctioned Pauline methods of transcultural communication employed in ancient Athens. As recounted in the New Testament, it was in a Greek pagan city on Mars Hill that St. Paul had the sympathetic comprehensiveness not "to break the altar of the unknown God." But it was also Paul's impertinent great- ness-in a sense as an Orientalist editor-interpreter-decipherer-compar- ativist-to presume that he knew more of the real, or hidden, meaning of Greek religion than the Athenians themselves (Acts 17:16-34): "'Whom ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you."' The political nature of the Pauline rhetorical paradigm is beautifully illustrated by the liberal American missionary to China, John Ross, who generally favored the Miillerian spirit of comparativism in his mission- ary work. For Ross (as influenced by Miiller's Sinological colleague at Oxford, James Legge), this implied the need for the "wise utilization of Confucianism" as a kind of "spiritual pablum" to break down the preju- dice of the Chinese toward Christianity. Confucianism becomes the "thin edge of the wedge of Christian truth," which, if used properly and selec- tively, will "gradually drive home the whole body of truth." This "thin edge" methodology is primarily understood as an unsentimental applica- tion of Paul's methods on Mars Hill. According to Ross, the important lesson to learn from this biblical model is the need to adapt one's method to the circumstances at hand and especially to be, as Paul was, "crafty" and as "wise as a serpent."63 It is this kind of serpentine guile, strategic tolerance, and hidden inter- pretive arrogance written into the heart of the Pauline paradigm that is finally championed by missionaries-whether Evangelical agents of the 63 John Ross, "Our Attitude Towards Confucianism" Chinese Recorder 18 (January 1887): 1-11. 242</page><page sequence="31">History of Religions London Missionary Society or comparativists and Oriental scholars at Oxford. More than a simple matter of secretly shared "universal" values, Paul's story is too often the tale of a velveteen glove of outward sympa- thy masking a methodological fist of religious or interpretive domina- tion. The Pauline narrative was ubiquitous in Victorian discourse about cross-cultural relations precisely because it allowed for, and sanctioned, a kind of camouflaged passage from the theological absolutism of the tra- ditional missionary enterprise and premodern academic culture to vari- ous "accommodationist" approaches, to the liberal-secular values of the social gospel, and also (in the eighteenth and especially the nineteenth centuries) to the ostensibly more objective and scientific institutions of academic Orientalist and comparative enterprise. FORGOTTEN BIBLES While there are several other materials relevant to Miller's always slip- ping and sliding arguments for the epochal importance of the Sacred Books and the "comparative spirit" in furthering the "universal history of mankind" I will conclude this article with only a brief contextual con- sideration of one later document. This is the popular, but substantial, ar- ticle titled "Forgotten Bible" that Muller published in 1884 upon the occasion of the completion of the first series of twenty-four volumes of the Sacred Books series.64 Particularly interesting is its discussion of some of the newer methodological issues associated with the anthropo- logical, ethnographic, or Tylorian tradition (called here the "Theoretical School") in the comparative study of religions. In the more openly ag- nostic and "decadent" fin-de-siecle era of the 1880s and 1890s (evi- denced by both liberal and conservative attacks on the Sacred Books and Miiller's various theories, as well as by his declining reputation among clever students at Oxford),65 it was evident that the "less reverent" an- thropological school was superseding the particular comparative spirit and monogenetic implications of the Miillerian, Orientalist, philological, and "Historical School" in the study of alien traditions.66 In this regard, 64 Max Muller, "Forgotten Bibles;' Nineteenth Century 15 (1884): 1004-22. 65 The conservative backlash against the Sacred Books is most famously and fatuously seen in a broadside published by Miller's old nemesis, Sir Monier Williams, the mission- ary scholar who triumphed over Muller in the contest for the Boden Professorship of San- skrit at Oxford in the 1860s. For details, see n. 80 below. It was, however, the repeated attacks from the better connected and more academically sophisticated liberal quarters that took the greater toll on Miiller's reputation at the end of the century-especially as exem- plified by the less reverent ethnographic comparativism associated with Edward Tylor and James Frazer. The final nail in the coffin of Miller's fame came about with the general de- mise of Miillerian and ethnographic comparativism after the turn of the century (a result furthered by the method's many egregious excesses). 66 On the monogenetic, or biblical and Babel-like implications, of Miillerian style com- parison and the triumph of the polygenetic ideas of the anthropological school, see esp. George W. Stocking, Jr., Victorian Anthropology (New York: Free Press, 1987), pp. 64- 69, 148-49, 182-84. 243</page><page sequence="32">Max Miller's "Sacred Books" it might also be said that the culture and institutions of scholarly dissent, along with the antagonistic dynamics of discursive fashion, are as impor- tant as the theoretical issues and personalities involved. Somewhat like Mircea Eliade's fate among graduate students at the University of Chi- cago in the late 1970s and 1980s, Muller became irrelevant when he became the brunt of various student jests in the Oxford Gazette. By the time of his death in 1900, it was reported that most of "young Oxford" found Muller to be less than intellectually fashionable or stimulating.67 Like his "forgotten bibles," Muller was himself in the uncomfortable position of being forgotten and ignored. Reacting, it would seem, both to the methodological challenge of the anthropological school and to his increasingly diminished prestige, Miil- ler begins his article by drawing attention to his own unique wisdom and bravery in undertaking such a difficult and consumptive enterprise as the Sacred Books. Leading a "noble army of martyrs" in the cause of Orien- tal scholarship, Miller reiterates much of his old elitist academic jus- tification for producing yet more volumes of Oriental "babbling." The reason now, as in 1879, is "historical" in that the Oriental scriptures are the crucial documents for studying the origin and development of reli- gions throughout the world. But, as Muller notes here, a new criticism had entered into the fray with regard to the worth, or lack of such, of a comparative approach to the developmental history of religion relying on the study of the ancient bibles of Oriental peoples. From the new, and in- creasingly more influential, anthropological point of view, the problem was that the approach of the Sacred Books was "purely" historical with- out the more philosophically sophisticated evolutionary perspective of those who study religion in relation to "psychophysiological experi- ments" or from "the creeds of living savages."68 Muller primarily has Edward Tylor in mind in this discussion of the "Theoretic" or "syn- thetic" (also equivalent to "constructive" and "a priori") school.69 Just the year before, Tylor had been appointed to a post at the University Mu- seum at Oxford and, with the 1881 publication of Anthropology: An Introduction to the Study of Man and Civilization in his 1883 "Lectures on Anthropology" in Nature, his approach was reaching new heights of influence in academic circles concerned with the developmental history of civilization-especially the even more fundamental evolutionary, or primitive "prehistory" of the so-called savage religions.70 67 See the obituary "Professor Max Miiller," Jackson's Oxford Journal (November 11, 1900). 68 Muller, "Forgotten Bibles," p. 1005. 69 See also Max Miller's "The Savage," Nineteenth Century 17 (1885): 109-32. 70 See Marjorie Wheeler-Barclay, "Science of Religion in Britain, 1860-1915" (Ph.D. diss., Northwestern University, 1987), pp. 144-226. 244</page><page sequence="33">History of Religions On the basis of what he considered his more careful and "analytic" approach to historical "facts" preserved in written documents, Muller stressed that his school in the study of religion was particularly sensitive to the lessons learned from the methods of comparative philology. For Miiller, this was a science, that, first of all, "takes language as it finds it" and only then traces it back through written sources as a "language fam- ily" (referring here to the three primary families of Aryan, Semitic, and Turanian/Chinese). This analytical process is akin to the tracing of a flower or fruit back to its seed by observing different preserved speci- mens of the growth cycle. In the case of philological analysis, this quasi- morphological method results in the discovery of the essential linguistic "roots" of a language which are but "metaphor[s]" for the "medium" of homologous analysis and for those "ultimate" facts that resist "all further analysis."71 According to Miiller, the Theoretic School claims that it is only necessary to watch a child imitate sounds to know how languages arise. The fallacy here, and Miller's point is well taken, is that interjec- tions or imitations "explain words which really require no explanation" (e.g., "crashing, cracking, creaking, crushing, scrunching") whereas "real words" (i.e., root words "expressive of general concepts" like man, tree, name, law) are left in the lurch. The Theoretic School simply takes it on its own theoretical faith that "real words" evolved out of the interjec- tional and imitative vocabulary.72 The same problems accrue in the comparative science of religion when considering the differences "between the historian and theorist." Assured that all human beings were originally "savages" or "children" the Tylo- rian theorist insists that the origin of religion-and its psychoevolution- ary agencies of "animism, personification, and anthropomorphism"- can be understood only by studying the lives of children and savages. Granting infantile behavior at any stage of civilizational development, the question remains for Miller an issue of faith-that is, how the core religious idea of the infinite, or the essential concept of a monotheistic god, could have simply evolved out of childish notions of animism. "However strange it may seem to us," the "chief lesson" from the study of "savage tribes" was, according to Miiller, that "the perception of the 71 Muller, "Forgotten Bibles," pp. 1006-7. 72 Ibid., pp. 1007-8. Muller was always careful to point out that he believed generally in the evolution or development of religions. His German romantic historical ideal (e.g., Herder's Entwicklung and Goethe's Das Werden or "Becoming") was obviously rooted in such an idea. Miller could therefore accept many aspects of Darwin's approach, but could not accept his overly theoretical "enthusiasm" for believing that "man genealogically de- scended from an animal" (p. 1015): "As language had been pointed out as a Rubicon which no beast had ever crossed, Darwin lent a willing ear to those who think that they can derive language, that is, real logos, from interjections and mimicry, by a process of spontaneous evolution, and produced himself some most persuasive arguments." But, says Miller, the "barrier of language remains as unshaken as ever." 245</page><page sequence="34">Max Miiller's "Sacred Books" Unknown or the Infinite was with many races as ancient as the percep- tion of the Known or the Finite, that the two were, in fact, inseparable."73 The rest of the article is devoted to a restatement of Muller's tried and true arguments for his historical school as exemplified by the Sacred Books-arguments that show Muller's historical method to be as theoret- ical and synthetic as anything speculatively proposed by Tylor and com- pany. That a reconstructed and hypothetical linguistic root or some kind of archaic henotheism is any more factual than interjectional words or animistic beliefs in terms of the original condition of language and religion is problematic, to say the least. Both positions were products of rival discursive traditions affirming either a "still reverent" idealistic phi- losophy (rooted in a belief in an "infinite" God or some Kantian transcen- dental category of the mind) or a more atheistic and materialistic faith that found the source of religious ideas in a postulated evolution of hu- man consciousness.74 Putting aside the questionable issue of which school was more truly historical or factual, we need to appreciate the self-referential cogency of Miller's position. It was his firm belief that he had something definite and authoritative (and therefore sacred) to hold onto-that is, the written- down and preserved documents of forgotten bygone eras now translated, remembered, and analyzed. From this perspective, anthropologists of Tylor's bent were only deceiving themselves by thinking that they could project present-day reports about illiterate "Red Indians, Africans, or Australians" back into the distant past. They should wait, as the linguis- tically adept Muller condescendingly remarked, until they "know at least 73 MUller, "Forgotten Bibles," p. 1011. 74 Despite the silliness of the nomenclature, the rationalistic and reductionist evolution- ary genre of "bow-wow" and "pooh-pooh" interjectional theories about language origins finally had the rhetorical edge over Miller's romantic and still reverent "ding-dong" no- tions of primordial linguistic resonance. The "bow wow" and "pooh pooh" theories amus- ingly referred to the idea that human language originated in the spontaneous imitation of animal sounds (bow wow) or in instinctual ejaculations called forth by bodily sen- sations (pooh pooh). See Otto Jespersen, Language, Its Nature, Development, and Origin (New York: Norton, 1964), pp. 413-16. See also Linda Dowling, "Victorian Oxford and the Science of Language," PMLA 97 (1969): 160-78. For Muller (in the ding-dong sense) it was a "law of nature" that "'everything which is struck rings . . . each substance has its peculiar ring"' (p. 174). This was a "creative faculty or instinct," or "mystic nexus be- tween mind and matter," which "supplied each new ideas 'as it thrilled for the first time through the brain' with its own distinctive sound." As Dowling says, Muller "retreated from this almost at once ... always offering modifications but without really disavow- ing it.... To see Miller's theory of linguistic roots as a function of his belief in the logos is finally to understand that Miller's rhetorical conduct of his lectures is the very en- actment of that belief. Quite simply, Muller entrusted ... much of his argument to word- play and metaphor and rhapsodic repetition" (p. 174). Many of Miiller's final theoretical efforts seemed to be in response to the threatening views of Edward Tylor's anthropologi- cal school and were often directed toward an idealistic understanding of the seamless- logical, essential, or spiritual-relation between pure thought and actual language, con- cepts and words, logos and history (e.g., his 1888 Science of Thought and parts of his 1888-92 Gifford Lectures). 246</page><page sequence="35">History of Religions their languages."75 In contrast to this, the comparative "study of book- religions, if we once have mastered their language, is easier, and admits of more definite and scientific treatment than that of native religions which have no books, no articles, no tests, no councils, no popes."76 A MORE MODEST ANATOMICAL METHOD Miiller's contention, noting again his need for a pretense of humility, was that the superiority of the Historical School is found in its "more mod- est" methods. The "true disciples of the Historical School" should con- sequently carry on their important work of "publishing and translating the ancient records of the great religions of the world" without regard for "the sneers of those who do not find in the Sacred Books of the East what they, in their ignorance, expected." Lapsing into a typically exces- sive stylistic refrain, Miller remarks that anthropologists with such a theoretical sneer-"who no doubt would turn up their noses at a kitchen- midden, because if did not contain their favourite lollypops"-can only be pitied.77 Miller's final metaphorical image for the methods of the Historical School is that of the technique and determination of "comparative anat- omy."78 Just as comparative anatomists had to overcome the squeamish- ness of the public toward the gruesome, but ultimately life-giving, work of dissecting the human carcass, so also must students of comparative religion have the fortitude to transform the "shudder" of revulsion to- ward alien religions, and the analytical dismemberment of all "religion," 75 Miiller, "Forgotten Bibles" (n. 64 above), p. 1010. 76 Ibid. This devaluing of living "savage" traditions, devoid of any of the sacred author- ity coming from the written-downness of recorded "history," lends itself to the general ne- glect of the popular and folk, or the more apparently oral and ritual, traditions of the common people, the "masses'" within highly literate traditions like India and China. The unstated implication was often that the illiterate "masses" in literate civilization traditions were essentially equivalent to "savages" or children. Use of the word "masses" to suggest a mindless, childish, barbaric, and emotional mob is a Victorian phenomenon. Human be- ings in large groups lose their individuality and reason and revert to an uncivilized or "savage" state. The OED, for example, notes that the term "masses" for the lower orders was basically a Victorian invention. The reformer's antithesis of "the classes" and the "masses" is attributed to Gladstone in the 1880s. Even when such popular living traditions clearly had "books, articles, tests, councils" or even "popes" like the Heavenly Masters tradition of Taoism practiced in south China in the nineteenth century, it was preferable to examine the essential and classical meaning of the religion in relation to its ancient writ- ten-down "bibles." We also witness the roots of a basic "present versus past" or "context versus text" bifurcation of subject matter, method, and mood associated with, on the one hand, the academic disciplines of anthropology and, on the other, with the comparative "history of religions." 77 Miller, "Forgotten Bibles'" p. 1010. 78 On the relation between humanistic comparison and "comparative anatomy," see esp. Jonathan Z. Smith's taxonomic survey of comparativism, "Adde Parvum Parvo Magnus Acervus Erit," History of Religions 11 (1971): 67-90, and also his later deliberations in A Magic Still Dwells: Comparative Religion in the Postmodern Age, ed.

By such a procedure, sympathetic students of religion will "see all that is good and all that is bad in various forms and phases of ancient faith." And such students "must be blinder than blind if they cannot see how the comparative anatomy of those foreign religions throws light on the ques- tions of the day, on the problems nearest to our own hearts, on our own philosophy, and on our own faith."79 It was the fear that such procedures, whether of the more agnostic the- oretic or of the residually reverent historic schools, would throw too much compromising light on the Christian faith that caused so many con- servative Victorians to aggressively resist the lure of comparison. Their quite legitimate concern was whether or not the analytical dissection was being performed on a dead or living body. The first kind of operation could-theoretically-lead to knowledge. The other most definitely re- sulted in murder. From a conservative theological perspective, it was better to defer deferentially to doctrine than deliberately to dissect. In many ways, however, the findings of the comparative sciences of the nineteenth century, both of the naturalistic and humanistic variety, had already irrevocably moved the academic study of religion away from a "muscular" Evangelical theology and an established biblical creed to- ward a more anatomical and pluralistic scrutiny of religion. Compara- tively speaking, this involved more of a relativized awareness of, if not always respect for, the sometimes strangely familiar religious "surviv- als" of savages and the haunting metaphysical and moral "homologies" of forgotten Oriental bibles. CONCLUSION Toward the end of the Victorian era the Christian religion was not com- pletely moribund within the national institutions of higher education in the Western world. But as an established and privileged way of knowing within the academy, theology was entering the last phases of its long slide into academic oblivion, a process of secularization that is roughly consummated after the First World War. This accelerating secular drift in universities led to some eleventh-hour reactionary defenses of traditional theological apologetics that are splendidly exemplified at Oxford by the Boden Professor of Sanskrit, Monier Williams, who constructed comi- 79 Muller, "Forgotten Bibles" p. 1022. The comparison of the science of religion with comparative anatomy is frequently encountered in methodological discussions at the end of the nineteenth century. See, e.g., the revealing article by A. M. Fairbairn, "What is Re- ligion?" The Congregationalist 13 (1884): 275-91. As Fairbairn says (pp. 282-83), "The historical question [is] ... the comparative question.... It puts the actual, extant, existing religions together, and compares them; and comparing them, proceeds on the same sci- entific principle that comparative anatomy recognizes when it may start with the structure of the leaf and culminate in the glorious anatomy of a man. And so you find running through the religions a structural principle." 248</page><page sequence="37">History of Religions cally pugnacious attacks on Muller and the whole "effeminate" enter- prise of the Sacred Books.80 Monier Williams's disgust bristles with images of a flaccidly liberal "indifferentism" that, among ever-vigilant conservative churchmen and still pious scholars, demanded a kind of militant homophobia directed against a limp-wristed comparative schol- arship proclaiming the universality of religions and the significance of the oriental Sacred Books. Ironically enough, it was not these conser- vative attacks that finally trivialized Miller's brand of comparison within the academy. Rather, the retreat of Miller's comparative science of religions after the turn of the century was aided and abetted by its underlying reliance on its own kind of pietistic Christian faith and its increasingly presumptuous manipulation of texts and "facts" within a progressively more secular and professionally specialized academic en- vironment. By the end of the First World War, Miller was very much a forgotten Victorian sage. In many ways, he had become only a vaguely embarrassing antecedent to Pierre Bourdieu's homo academicus, who, in the dismal aftermath of the Great War, was more fully and faithlessly im- bued with a "critical habitus"-that is, a system of thought and action that had become more self-consciously and triumphantly secular, scien- tistic, specialized, historic, positivistic, and frequently agnostically non- religious or even antireligious.81 But with regard to either Monier Williams's conservative apologetics or Miiller's more liberal comparative "science of religion," it is quite clear, as Richard King has observed, that "the presuppositions of Chris- tian theology" have "predominated in the construction of discourses about the 'Other' (in this case the other 'world religions')." It was this kind of overarching Christian or Protestant paradigm ("complete," as King says, with its "textualist, salvationist and universalistic presuppositions"; although it should be noted, as most critics do not, that "protestant" here 80 Although Monier Williams had for many years espoused a vaguely liberal position on Oriental religions, he was suddenly motivated in 1887 to unleash an aggressive attack on what he called the flabby sentiments, and "jelly-fish tolerance," promoted by The Sacred Books of the East. Part of Monier Williams's "conversion experience" in this regard was no doubt due as much to his gnawing bitterness over the large and small slights rendered by Muller as it was to his intellectual and religious concerns. Whatever the case, he was clearly voicing broadly based sentiments of anger and frustration over the progressive in- roads of liberal attitudes and agnostic leanings at Oxford and throughout Victorian society. "Every library," Monier Williams said, "teems with infidel publications; false criticism and carping scepticism are in the air" (quoted here from Richard Symonds, Oxford and Empire [London: Macmillan, 1986], p. 111). For the full text, see Sir M. Monier-Williams, The Holy Bible and the Sacred Books of the East: Four Addresses; To which is Added a Fifth Address On Zenana Missions (pamphlet) (London: Seeley &amp; Co., 1887). For Monier Williams, the Sacred Books and comparativism in general were a sure sign of the "degen- erate" and "unmanly" tenor of the times. 81 Pierre Bourdieu defines habitus as "a system of shared social dispositions and cogni- tive structures which generates perceptions, appreciations, and actions." See Pierre Bour- dieu, Homo Academicus, trans. Peter Collier (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1988), p. 279, n. 2. 249</page><page sequence="38">Max Miiller's "Sacred Books" has particular reference to certain aspects of postmillennialist liberal evangelicalism) that was given authoritative sanction (or transcendental "sacrality") by Muller's Sacred Books. And despite repeated appeals to the historical and bookish facticity of his approach to understanding re- ligions, Miller's comparative method tends to crush difference in the interests of a universal sameness. It betrays an "endemic essentialism" where "abstract notions of 'religion"' become "divorced from their actual historical circumstances and manifestations."82 Whether or not all of this is intrinsically evil or so very different from the totalizing assumptions found in the more fully secularized discursive habits of other humanistic and social scientific disciplines of the modern era I leave to another time and place. At the very end of these reflections on a bygone era making passage to the modern academic world, it is well that we postmodern religionists at the turn of the millennium-as the academic inheritors of Miller's checkered (but by no means insignificant) legacy who are also experienc- ing a virtual sea change in the fundamental institutions of acquiring and distributing knowledge-take to heart Richard King's admonition about such matters. What must not be lost... in the call to abandon categories such as "religion" and the autonomy and distinctiveness of "religious studies" as a discipline is the pluralistic and multidisciplinary focus that prevents the erasure of indigenous perspectives and contests the hegemony of secularism in the Western Acad- emy. Whatever form the comparative study of religion takes in a post-colonial and post-theological era, it has an important role to perform as a "foreign body," an alien presence, challenging the secularist and Eurocentric founda- tions on which the Western Academy has been established.83 The point is that a self-reflexive comparative study of religion more aware of its own alien status and the ambiguous strangeness of religion, still has an important "humanizing" role to play in the postmodernist academic environment of the twenty-first century where a kind of arro- gant corporate globalism, digital unreality, and hypersecularity increas- ingly prevails.84 Lehigh University 82 See Richard King, Orientalism and Religion: Postcolonial Theory, India, and "The Mystic East" (London and New York: Routledge, 1999), pp. 67, 69. 83 King, p. 61. 84 See David Chidester's Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1996), and many of the essays published in Kimberley C.
