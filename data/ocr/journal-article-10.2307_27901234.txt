<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION1 THE spirit of our times is hospitable to novelties. It is predisposed to believe that what is later is more desirable, and that what is new is, if not good, at least better. On occasion, this spirit is even deliberately capi talized. At any rate, a proclamation of novelty is almost invariably issued whenever grounds therefor are at hand. In the realm of theory, however, continuity is an asset, as it is the rule. Hence it is that we have acquired a large number of neo-isms. In philosophy, we hear much of neo realism, neo-Kantianism, neo-idealism, the new naturalism, the new psychology, and the new morality. To this ex ploiting of novelty by terminology, however, there is one conspicuous exception. It is to be found in the case of that particular doctrine in the philosophy of religion which might fittingly have been christened neo-Ptolemaism. This designation, however, has remained without adoption. The proponents of the view in question have preferred instead to claim part title, along with other groups, to the label 'humanism/ Within the religious outlook, man's estimates of him self and of his importance in the sight of his deities have oscillated widely. Speaking of western Christianity how ever?as we shall for the most part do in all that follows? one may safely say that dominantly, and in comparison 1 Read as the address of the President of the Midwestern Division of the American Theological Society, before the autumn meeting of the Di vision, in Chicago, November 25, 1929.</page><page sequence="2">282 THE MONIST with other things of the created world, the individual and the society to which he belongs have occupied an exceed ingly enviable status; indeed, they have been regarded as in the focus of divine regard. Herein lay one of the chief sources of the psychological strength of geocentrism. To the religious consciousness of medievalism man and his abode seemed indisputably to belong at the very center of God's cosmos. Hence the severe attack that was made upon the rising Copernicanism. To be sure it has some times been said that Copernicanism affected simply the ex ternals of the contemporary Christianity. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the new doctrine made untenable the more crassly anthropomorphic conceptions of God and shattered existing notions as to the locations of heaven and hell, and, indeed, the prevailing cosmology in general. That this was indeed the result of Copernicanism, and, what is more far-reaching still, that the very principle of authority was threatened by it, is obvious even to the first glance. But a second look will disclose one thing more, and it is especially this that disturbed so profoundly the religious sentiments of the day. In an order within which the earth itself is subsidiary to another celestial body, and is but part of a system that in turn is of but microscopic significance in the incalculably vast multiplicity of worlds extending into a limitless beyond, how difficult to preserve the re ligiously vital sense of the supreme worth of man or the conviction that upon him is centered the divine thought and love. Thus it was only through a fierce and prolonged wres tling of the spirit, and as the issue of the most poignant suffering, that man eventually won his way to religious serenity within the cosmos that displaced Ptolemaism. Ir resistibly, even though slowly, the measureless enlargement of the spatial order, and the ultimate demolition of the</page><page sequence="3">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 283 narrow time dimensions of biblical cosmology, prepared the way for a magnified conception of the object of religious devotion. They led to a god-idea of immensely greater comprehensiveness, as in the case of the Spinozists, for example, or of vastly enhanced power and majesty, among circles which held fast to the doctrine of transcendence. In this latter case, God was likewise credited with an un speakably deep love, for, despite his indescribable power and glory, he was nevertheless conceived to brood over man and to hold precious each individual soul. The religion that thus evolved throbbed with a truly cosmic emotion and in so far proved infinitely sustaining and deep. Never theless, it easily led to a haunting realization that the ways and thoughts of a god such as it came to possess could no longer be conceived in analogy with those of his creatures. God at such times seemed afar off. In seeking him many confronted a yawning gulf so broad that even their most active imaginations were abruptly checked at its brink. Beyond the utmost reach of imagery and definite ideas, the god that had come to be was suspected, in due course, of an inability to make himself directly heard by the human soul or felt in the events of nature and history. In con sequence, be lost his appeal to many a religious conscious ness. He became as unreal as he was remote. Involved in this issue were influences connected with the development that culminated in Newton's Principia. The period was one that gradually brought to consolidation the idea of invariable laws of nature. Among the educated classes, at any rate, the external world came to be regarded as an inexorable order of events. Because of its rigorous and rationally luminous structure, the science of mechanics became the model for knowledge generally. As regards physical nature, tenable and objective knowledge was con strued in terms of data which relate to events within a</page><page sequence="4">284 THE MONIST spatial and temporal world and which are organized by various pervasive principles, particularly that of causality. The known world, that which constitutes the object of rational self-conscious experience and of science, was con ceived as a unified order of elements or substances existing in spatial and temporal relationships and conformable to universal laws of causation. Such a world cannot admit the effective invasion of specific activities on the part of a transcendent will or being. God was thus shorn of his direct practical r?le in the world of man's knowledge and practical concerns. He coud survive only as an absentee power, without real influence upon or within the existing world order, but related thereto, in any practically signifi cant way, only at some point in the infinitely distant past when, for aught that is demonstrable to the contrary, he may have brought it into being. The consequence was that, however much or little he might factor in cosmological theories, he could not retain for the religious consciousness that vital and centrally significant place which he had previously held. But the religious spirit demands attachment, for re ligion is a mode of consciousness that is directed upon, and finds its orientation in, an object. Under the circumstances this object was not unnaturally sought among the realities more immediately at hand than was the pale figure of the far distant god of the speculative imagination. So the search turned to the empirical order of space and time. May there not be, it was queried, within the very bounds of the earth itself and of the life of history as it has run its course and plunges into the future, something to which the religious spirit may turn for the fulfillment of its needs? This question took crystallization midst a welter of in fluences that conspired to divert the interests of men to the values and the possibilities of the historical life of man</page><page sequence="5">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 285 kind: influences connected with a rising knowledge of the rich civilizations of antiquity and the deep satisfactions which they mediated ; with the discovery of new lands and untold resources holding forth high promise to men of ad venturous courage; with the elaboration of modes of in vestigation yielding a type of knowledge that pointed the way to the control of nature and of man, and that therefore spelled power; with the growth of social and political liberty and the increasing emancipation of the individual from direct ecclesiastical interference; with freer social contacts and widening sympathies. Thus came a changed orientation and a new set of values. With a fuller sense of indebtedness to others that had gone before, with a deepened gratitude that intensified the spirit of social de votion, and with an enhanced power born of scientific knowledge, it seemed that perhaps an individual might satisfy the full requirements of his nature through the direction of his conscious interests, and the unreserved dedication of his energies, to his life within, and to the furtherance of, that human society of which he is a mem ber. It seemed that he might perhaps establish a religious ly significant relation of gratitude and high respect, if not of worship, and of determined moral service, if not of ultimate confidence, to that obviously real and thoroughly empirical order of spirits to whom he seems so obviously indebted for much that he deeply prizes and to whom he owes and may zealously render his utmost devotion. For is not such a relationship one that is free from outworn superstitions and from solicitations to vain illusions, one that unifies life, meets its most insistent demands, and provides adequate opportunity for the expression of all its capabilities? Have we not in mankind a religious object that remains for us solid and compellingly real, thoroughly convincing in its contrast with the imaginings of the in</page><page sequence="6">286 THE MONIST veterate theologian and the airy speculations of the cos mologist and metaphysician; an object of rational and con trolled emotions rather than of vague feelings and mystic sentimentalities; an object directive of practically signifi cant and socially valuable conduct in lieu of strange and futile cult activities? Thus arose the call to an anthropo centrism and a neo-Ptolemaism in religion. Odd, nevertheless, the phenomenon in part remains. It was in a large measure faithfulness to the leadings of science that originally impelled deeply reluctant men to abandon the sheltered confines of Ptolemaism and to strike out into the wide expanses of reality, there to carry on their religious lives midst limitless horizons. Today the same faithfulness is appealed to?among other factors?in be half of a retreat from the larger cosmos to a tiny world thereof, in order that, unexposed to besetting vagaries and threatening confusion, man may possess an object in dubitably real while yet allegedly worthy of religious atti tudes and adequate for religious needs. The movement in question has, to be sure, been a spiral one. The end is significantly different from the beginning. The religious society of original Ptolemaism included transcendent mem bers?these indeed were its rulers, among whom one was vested with autocratic and absolute powers. Such mem bers, however, modern sentiments of democracy, and the empirical, if not the positivistic, notions of today, preclude us from retaining within the religious group, or from giv ing even a speculative recognition. Accordingly the earlier dependence upon the divine has been superseded by reliance on one's self and one's human fellows. The sense of help lessness has given way to confidence in the power born of scientific knowledge and sustained by the enthusiasm of an unyielding will. The petitioner has become the creator. Thus, while we again today have a Ptolemaism in re</page><page sequence="7">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 287 ligion, this is not a mere reversion but is clearly neo Ptolemaism. It involves an outright and consistently main tained rejection of the transcendental. Moreover, it thinks of religion in terms of the requirements of human life in its relations to the empirical environment. It regards its function as essentially practical, and hence strongly tends to identify religion with social idealism.2 It is essentially anthropocentric. Nature for it seems for the most part but incidental, receiving serious consideration only insofar as it impinges on human aspirations or affords a leverage for human advancement. Whether it presupposes or im plies a comprehensive world view or a metaphysics is a point concerning which its spokesmen speak hesitatingly yet seem disagreed. II Humanism is evidence that religion must perpetually reckon afresh with all the various forces of culture. What ever may be the teachings or the implications of religion regarding the enjoyment of peaceful bliss, it itself, since the age of self-consciousness, has quite generally been in the thick of things, and it is probably doomed to perpetual strife. Reallignments in social and institutional life, and radical shifts in the nature and relative strength of human interests, introduce conditions in which religion is unable to enjoy the immunities of a mere bystander or a neutral. Such changes have always impinged upon it, sometimes for good but again ominously. In modern times, for example, state, school, hospital, club, social agency, com munity and cultural centers, and the like, have exhibited 2 In view of the difficulty which this doctrine has in giving to religion genu inely distinct functions and values, must one not suspect that the retention by its representatives of the good old word "religion" evidences simply a reluct ance to forego the sentimental assets of a term ? Living in such a glass house, neo-Ptolemaists might prudently refrain from continuing an analogous charge against those who retain the term "God" in spite of the fact that they are unable to give it a definition either precise or adequate for logical requirements.</page><page sequence="8">288 THE MONIST an independence and have asserted prerogatives propor tional to their rapidly increasing vigor. In the face of them, religious institutions have continuously felt compelled to fight for the preservation of distinctive functions, that is to say, for their vitality. Shifting indeed have here been the areas of competition and the lines of conflict. In some form or another, however, religion has been involved in them ever since institutional life has tended towards in creasing differentiation and specialization, and its various organs have intensified their claims to independence. When we take note of religion's attempts to stake out her claims in the realm of human interests and values, the past centuries present a record of claims and counterclaims. Conflicts in views and theory have been unintermittent. Religion entered the modern scene as the revealer and mediator of the transcendent, and by virtue hereof as rightfully dominant in all phases of the life and culture of the individual and of society. What this means in one of its aspects is vividly portrayed by James Bryce in a pas sage which, though familiar, continues to stir our imagina tions. "A life in the church," we read in The Holy Roman Empire, "through the church; a life which she blessed in mass at morning and sent to peaceful rest by the vesper hymn; a life which she supported by the constantly recur ring stimulus of the sacraments, relieving it by confession, purifying it by penance, admonishing it by the presenta tions of visible objects for contemplation and worship, this was the life which they of the Middle Ages conceived of as the rightful life of many, the ideal of all. The unseen world was so unceasingly pointed to, and its dependence on the scene so intensely felt, that the barrier between the two semed to disappear." In medieval Christianity the full sweep of religion was in evidence. As the guardian of truths and values eternal and unchallengeable, the or</page><page sequence="9">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 289 gans of religion held the r?le of arbiter in thought, taste, and conduct. The direction of all the several lines of temporal pursuits was in their hands. The kingdoms of this world and those of truth were assigned by religious authority to their respective provinces. Reality as a whole was deemed a hierarchy of forms and values. The lower substances, it was thought, indeed actualize their own dis tinctive forms, yet they were believed to possess a wider meaning. They were conceived as the material conditions for the actualization of the next higher forms, leading to man, who, in turn, aspires to the realization of a rational life, culminating at length in the contemplation of God. Thus the final reality and the goal of all nature was found in God. Knowledge reached completion when it passed over into religion and attained a conscious realization that everything must be construed as pointing towards God. Thus religion was for a time the uncontested ruler over all the domains alike of idea and ideal. But then revolu tions broke forth. Religion found herself confronted by a succession of vigorous claimants who sought at once to deprive her of her celestial domain and to secure for them selves increasing powers and eventually even undivided authority in one after another of those realms previously subordinate to her. Though religion was gradually forced to reckon with these claims, and to come to terms with them, she has stubbornly resisted complete surrender. She has sought to preserve for herself some territory beneath the sun, some place all her own within the system of hu man values and active cultural interests. This has involved her in perpetual intellectual conflicts down to the very present. The struggles that ensued have been on shifting fronts. Generally speaking, the first challenge to religion was in</page><page sequence="10">290 THE MONIST respect to her claims to the field of knowledge. Here she had not restricted herself to affirmations regarding the transcendent but, characteristically, had set forth and de fended as infallibly true many specific teachings concerning the earth and its relation to the firmament and its bodies; concerning the forms of life that occupy the earth, more especially man?his origin, nature, needs and salvation; concerning human history, particular events of its past and still to come, as well as a sweeping philosophy of its mean ing as a divine drama. Scientific investigation, however, pursuing paths of its own by use of a new compass and of novel methods, reached results divergent from religious teachings, even negating some that seemed to be of f ounda tional significance. The new results were no less capable than the earlier of organization into comprehensive sys tems; on the other hand, they possessed the tremendously convincing advantage of definite vindication by phenomena of perceptual experience, as well as of conferring upon man extensive powers in the way of prediction and control. Suffering from these heavy handicaps, the dictums of re ligion were unable to maintain themselves. Ever more widely and clearly it came to be recognized that the facts of nature and of history, of man's own being and that of society, could be captured by scientific procedure alone, and that those who commanded the specialized techniques of the various sciences must be given the protectorate over the domains of truth. Of all these, then, extending to the outermost boundaries of actual or possible experience, re ligion was dispossessed. Religion, it was felt, could not be respected unless it renounced its claims to satisfy man's cognitive needs. If it undertook to assert itself in this field it was exposed to the peril of losing the genuine respect of all who would not be traitors to the truth as declared by a critical and disciplined reason operating with scientific</page><page sequence="11">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 291 method. Thus, then, one of the main constituents of hu man culture acquired emancipation. Many there were who long continued to argue that, while science was an organ of truth, its findings were in essential harmony with what religion had long taught. The attempt was to prove that, although science made its discoveries independently, the same teachings had pre viously been proclaimed by religion. This attempt, how ever, was so awkward or led to such casuistry and violent perversion of plain meanings that those who sponsored it fell under the wide-spread suspicion of ignorance, stupid ity, or duplicity. The outcome was the generally accepted belief that scientific knowledge is not merely authoritative as respects questions of specific fact but that it also repre sents something altogether distinct, in character and intent, in point of view and in conclusions, from anything which religion is competent to undertake. He who would read the books of nature and of life in prose must go to disci plines that are independent of religion. In some quarters, to be sure, the question was raised whether religion did not possess the cognitive function of supplying the truth about a supernatural and a metempiri cal world. But how, it was answered, can there be knowl edge of anything that does not fall within that ordered realm of events which constitutes our world of space and time? How, indeed, can we as much as know that there is a God, since no deduction or argument can with confi dence carry us to any reality that falls outside such a world? Thus it was, for example, that an examination of rationally grounded theistic arguments convinced Kant of their irremediably defective nature. Today it has become clear that even this negative con clusion of the Alleszermalmer of Koenigsberg was not without positive significance to religion. What was crushed</page><page sequence="12">292 THE MONIST was a formalism and at most an abstract rationalism which, whatever its powers to charm the theologian, was of no vital importance to religion but on the contrary was even a decoy luring religion to extinction. Not upon the materials destroyed by Kant does or can religion sustain itself. Then, also, Kant's argument, whatever its ravages, left to religion a number of distinct possibilities in the economy of human interests and life. Did not the critical philosopher himself say that his removal of knowledge pre pared the way for faith ? Or may not perhaps the experi ence of beauty mediate a living consciousness of ultimate purpose and value as expressed in that world of phenomena which we know? Or, again, may not religion perhaps have a share in the domain of conduct ? Indeed, is it cer tain that man's rational nature is triadic, and that outside truth as the value of the intellect, beauty as the value of sensibility, and goodness as the value of will, there remains no other function of consciousness with a corresponding value in the culture of society? All of these possibilities, and others, were explored, and need to be re-explored, be fore passing to the conclusion that religion is not an inde pendent feature or type of experience but that the word survives and, for sentiment's sake, we will preserve it un der the shelter of social idealism. Now while Kant had contended that the limitations of knowledge leave room for faith, it was soon apparent that in his doctrine, as most generally formulated, faith rein troduced the very conception of God to which the ration alistic procedure of contemporary deism had come. If, however, religion is an expression of faith rather than the pursuit or the conclusions of knowledge, this faith is cer tainly not one that simply reinstates conceptions originated by a knowledge that has stepped beyond its legitimate boundaries. Hence various thinkers renewed the attempts</page><page sequence="13">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 293 to extend the scope of knowledge beyond the frontiers of what Kant conceived as the phenomenal world. The re sult was a considerable variety of contentions. For ex ample, it was urged that one need but interpret as regula tive the various principles which Kant regarded as con stitutive of experience, and scientific knowledge appears in its true light, namely as something partial and abstract, requiring completion through more concrete modes of ap prehension and the use of categories capable of yielding wider and more coherent systems of fact and meaning. Or, again, one need but take seriously the correlativity of the subject and object within experience, and realize that, as regards both its existence and nature, the object is de pendent upon the subject, to understand that spirit is a central feature of reality, if indeed it is not the absolute within whose experience the correlatives of subject and object, and all relativities, are included. Still again we are asked to bear in mind that science has discarded the view of inert lump matter in favor of a dynamic conception; that the principle of causality can no longer be regarded as holding of all entities within reality; that the appearance of continuous and determinate orders of events is but a mask of discontinuity, due to the fact that individual events, subject alone to laws of probability, are taken en masse ; that evolution must be recognized as a process not of the unfolding of something given but of the emergence of much that is genuinely new. When considerations such as these are kept in view, it is urged, we find indicated a conception of reality significant to the religious spirit. Or, still again, it is argued that the events which constitute the actual world must be construed as individuations or materializations or embodiments of universals or subsis tents which constitute the wider realm of reality, and that a principle of concretion must be recognized if we would</page><page sequence="14">294 THE MONIST deal at all seriously with the problem of our empirical order of fact in its relation to the subsistential realm. These allusions to different metaphysical doctrines need not be multiplied in illustration of widely prevalent contentions that the limits to which Kant restricted knowledge are altogether too narrow and that reason may and does yield a metaphysics which in no wise confronts us with the simple alternative of a humanistic religion or a religion that retreats to realms impenetrable to knowledge and pre sumably the creation of desires rebuffed by the circum stances of real life. Humanists, as was above indicated, have differed on the question whether their doctrine of religion either im plies or is implied by some specific form or forms of meta physical outlook. Some there are who would keep their religious thesis clear of any connection with a cosmology or general philosophy. Others, however, represent it as the logical resultant of an empirical approach to philosophy and, in particular, of naturalism, either of the reductive or of the evolutionary type. The strength of these positions, however, is then assumed rather than seriously argued. If it is reductive naturalism that is taken as the ground of religious neo-Ptolemaism, the stability of the latter is in deed precarious. For if the history of philosophy has taught any lessons at all, one of them assuredly is the fact that a disregard of certain features of a situation, for specialized scientific or other purposes, does not in fact annihilate these features, much less cause them never to have been at all. The philosophy which starts with the body of knowledge represented by some one of the mathe matical or natural sciences, and asserts that this exhausts the fullness of whatever may be called real, and that reality is nothing but what appears in the selected body of knowl edge, is certainly very naive or stubbornly blind and un</page><page sequence="15">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 295 teachable. So much is affirmed even by naturalisms of the evolutionary stamp. Those humanists, however, who ap peal to a naturalism of this latter sort need to give more careful scrutiny than they have as yet done to the ques tion whether their religious thesis does as a matter of fact follow from the philosophy they invoke. The theistic con clusions to which Lloyd Morgan came are at least a warn ing to this effect. There is a further consideration of such significance in this connection that it may not be passed without a word. Whatever may be the particular background of naturalism against which religious neo-Ptolemaists project their views, it involves the doctrine that man is thorough-goingly or ganic to nature. He sprang from the loins of nature, and from its resources he has drawn his growth and powers. His natural history is his complete history. Once, how ever, this theme is developed by neo-Ptolemaists, generally by way of a radical antithesis to the dualisms of super natural and transcendental philosophies, the mood shifts from the major into the minor key. Nature is now sup posed to be alien to man. The physical environment, at any rate, is construed as hostile to his finer ambitions or, at the very least, as unsuited to his spiritual realization. Creatures of neglect and enmity, like birds of a feather generally, tend to become all the more deeply united and at tached to one another. So human beings, recoiling from the cold and perilous cosmos, find in their relations to one another the requisite strength and objectives for the high est living. To a critic this recovery of good from an alien and hostile world seems but another testimony to man's in effaceable tendency to give a favorable reading to his en vironment. It must indeed be fully admitted that no person should, and that no serious person will, be content to keep his re</page><page sequence="16">296 THE MONIST ligion in a water-tight compartment, unexposed to the cur rents of scientific and philosophic thought. These currents must be allowed free opportunity to transform so far as they may the religious outlook and experience of the indi vidual. A shift in world view should and will reflect itself in religious feeling and action. Conceding all of this with out reservation, it must nevertheless be remembered that a world, view should not be dictated by any one phase or element or specialized interpretation of experience?by sense perception, mathematics, any one of the sciences or even all of them collectively, aesthetic appreciation, ethical values, or religious attitudes. In metaphysics, as in politi cal life, conformity to principles may legitimately be ex acted only where the constitutent members have been al lowed an influence in the shaping of the ruling norms. Humanists, in epitome, are not agreed as to whether their doctrine derives its strength from the fact that it is implied by a certain method or doctrine of philosophy; those who hold that it is, have failed to demonstrate that the relation of implication does as a matter of fact hold; and even were the relation established, the doctrine would have all the uncertainty that attaches to the basic philos ophy. He would be reckless indeed who alleged that humanism is dictated by the present state of scientific and philosophic knowledge. Such a contention should be but the last resort of a humanist after he had failed to induce conviction through a psychological analysis of experience or through appeal to the facts of religious development. What light, we would now turn to ask, may be gained from those who teach that we may catch the distinctive spirit and expression of religion in connection with the aesthetic experience? Of those who have so taught per haps it is Fries who will best serve our present purposes. For, on the one hand, Fries specifies those experiences</page><page sequence="17">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 297 which prima facie impress us as disclosing within our phenomenal world the presence of the real and the divine ; they are, he teaches, feelings of purposiveness that attach to our apprehensions of the beautiful and the sublime. This analysis of experience, moreover, Fries supplements with an elaborate argument designed to substantiate the validity of these impressions or feelings of purposiveness. As convenient an approach as any to Fries's doctrine will be by way of the argument through which he seeks to establish what type of experience it is in which that which is real and divine might be expected to manifest itself. This argument rests on a conviction, strongly forti fied by Kant's Transcendental Dialectic, that reason by its very structure leads to antinomies whenever it addresses itself to ultimate problems. For, knowledge must be of the definite and limited, whereas reason is dissatisfied with anything short of the infinite and unlimited. All attempts to conceive the latter, however, yield an apprehension of but the limited. Everywhere thought experiences a limit, yet no less certainly has it, as the very precondition of this experience, transcended the limit in question. That a radical antinomy may infect reality is not credible, so long especially as we may ascribe the antinomy to the very structure of thought. In sum, cognition is capable of presenting only a phenomenal world. The world of real being, though to reason a necessary and a priori idea or ideal, remains as to its nature an object of faith. Regard ing it the only legitimate affirmations are denials of those limitations that pervade our known and knowable world; we may assert of it absence of conditions, or freedom and eternity, and absence of compositeness and multiplicity, or unity, such as is represented by God. Man, however, is not a knower only but also a moral agent. He ^pursues ends, and these, when morally required, are not conditional,</page><page sequence="18">298 THE MONIST hypothetical and instrumental but are unconditioned and categorical; they are absolute and self-validating, and as such they do not point to anything beyond themselves. Such an unconditioned end is moral perfection. Here, then, we have the clue to the character of an absolute. Thus do we acquire the connotation of that conception of ultimate and real being which to thought is a necessary idea but is through it definable only by way of negations of the limitations of the world as known. Reality, that is, is a realm in which the moral end, that is, the absolute, is realized ; it is a society of morally perfect beings completely harmonious with the ruling will of God. But reason will not rest at this point. It demands a unification of the real and the phenomenal orders. It harbors a conviction that there is a significant connection between the two. If such a connection obtains, the phenomenal order must involve an expression or revelation of ultimate reality. Since, now, our clue to the nature of the real is furnished by moral experience, we must conceive reality in terms of purpose. Hence we may conclude that the unique feature of the phenomenal world in which reality expresses itself is that of purposiveness. Purposiveness, however, can be shown not to be a valid category of theoretical interpretation ; we may in consequence be sure that it is a feature of the world that we intuit or feel rather than know. Now Fries held that in the contemplation of beautiful or sublime phenomena of nature, works of art, or human personalities we have a convincing feeling of purposiveness, and the argument which we have just sketched is utilized by him to validate the claims of this feeling. The feeling itself he construes as divination and as representing man's re ligious nature. Thus, though conceding to an independent theoretical interest the cultivation of a knowledge that is organized by universal principles, Fries retains for religion</page><page sequence="19">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 299 the function of yielding, by way of a characteristically aesthetic experience, a genuine glimpse of the real and the divine. But is such a view unimpeachable? Obviously not, if only for the reason that it is extremely doubtful whether aesthetic contemplation under ordinary circumstances ac tually involves such a sense of purposiveness. Moreover, the aesthetic experience is in essence one of enjoyment. Religious experience, in contrast, contains an element of poignancy: consider, for example, the repentance and re morse inevitable when a consciousness of the divine impels an individual to an honest probing of himself. Is, further more, the religious experience one singly of admiration and adoration, or does it likewise carry an urge to deeds of service? Is, for example, the Christian's attitude toward Jesus, qua religious, that of admiration and aesthetic satis faction alone, or also that of a discipleship which, refusing in contemplation to detach itself from the world and to escape its tragedies, endeavors, through its discipleship and sacrificial living, to vivify the experience of a universal source of finite spirits and to promote the claims of social justice and good will ? Still again, is religion a conscious ness of ultimate, static, and changeless being, or an active relationship to a living will operating to sustain whatever incorporates values and to create new worlds and heavens ? In short, aesthetic sensibility, in common with the truth quest, lacks features which religion must be conceded to possess. Whatever may be the connection of the aesthetic or the cognitive life with religion, neither the one nor the other is to be identified with religion or is to be regarded as disclosing in some way a metempirical, supernatural world where religion dwells apart. Does this suggest the conclusion that the characteristic spirit of religion is to be found in the activity of volition as</page><page sequence="20">300 THE MONIST this culminates in the moral life and more especially in humanistic loyalties ? Anthropologically speaking, of course, religion and morality have at times been quite dis tinct. The former has declared indispensable acts with reference to which morality as such was quite indifferent or to which, indeed, it was even hostile; and, conversely, lines of conduct dictated by morality have been outside the purview of religion or on occasion even condemned by it. At developed levels this cleavage strongly tends to dis appear, but now we find that the moral consciousness, hav ing become reflective, insists) that moral principles, qua moral, are independent of supernatural origin or extrinsic sanctions. Morality postulates the autonomy of the ra tional agent or it ceases to be more than a hollow sound. At this point in his thought, Kant, under the pressure of finding a distinctive r?le for religion, referred to it, in its subjective aspect, as the recognition of all our duties as divine commands. The thought is difficult to maintain. Whoever lives as he ought, according to Kant, serves God in the only manner acceptable to reason. And it is not de sirable that the thought of God be superadded to the consciousness of the moral imperative, else the purity of the ethical motive may be prejudiced, and man may be tempted to act from other considerations than solely out of reverent obedience to the commands of duty. In any case, morality stands in no greater need of a religion other than itself than does knowledge. It must ascertain its duties by ways characteristic of itself, and these duties must be faced without regard to considerations relating to any world other than that of physical nature, the human indi vidual, and concrete social life. However moral theories may diverge, they are today essentially at one in holding that the discovery of what is ethically required and the motivations for living accordingly are matters for which</page><page sequence="21">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 301 religion need not be invoked. Such discovery is properly the task of intelligence or of the moral reason, and such motivation must be sought in developed and socialized feeling-impulse. Morality, like knowledge and art, expresses the life of reason and develops in the soil of experience. It comes to fulfillment in the form of a distinguishable and autono mous human interest. Like cognition and sensibility, voli tion opens no window into the hyperempirical toward which religion may turn and thus differentiate itself from all that concerns itself with the empirical. Religion, however, has always been more intimately associated with ethical living than with either truth-seeking or the enjoyment of beauty. In view of these considerations would we not do well frankly to identify religion with morality? Such seems to be in the minds of many who have reached humanistic conclusions. They construe the primary functions of con sciousness as cognition, feeling and will, and their goals as truth, beauty and goodness; and they concede to each of these primary functions thorough autonomy in its own expression. On the other hand, they reject all notions of a transcendent reality. What other conclusion is pos sible, they seem to feel, than that the only reasonable view of religion is in terms of social idealism. More recently than Comte, and over a path all his own, the profound philosopher Hermann Cohen reached a kin dred view. Religion, he pointed out, had its origin in myth. The same is true of science, art, and morality. These, however, speedily freed themselves from the condi tions of their origin and pursued independent lines appro priate to them. Religion, on the other hand, seemed for a long time to depend upon its association with myth; it seemed to feel gods and other elements of mythology to be indispensable. Yet the germs of something higher were</page><page sequence="22">302 THE MONIST here too manifest far earlier than is sometimes believed. The development from polytheism to monotheism, for ex ample, is not so much a matter merely of a reduction in the number of gods as it is a renunciation of mythology in favor of morality. The change was vitally connected with the transition from the performance of cult acts to the exercise of justice and mercy toward one's fellows and the manifestation of the humility becoming to man. Polytheism is not so much a form of religion as it is a manifestation of mythology. Religion in the true sense of the term was born with monotheism?it is the child of the ethical con sciousness, and it is true to itself only in the form of humanitarianism. It was by an independent line of reasoning that Paul Natorp came to the conclusion suggested by the title of his book, Religion within the Bounds of Humanity, obviously a paraphrase of the title of Kant's major work on the subject. As an orthodox neo-Kantian Natorp held with rigid consistency to the doctrine that reason knows nought of the transcendent and that religion must therefore re nounce all attachment thereto. Religion is an expression of feeling. By feeling, however, we must understand the basis and the matrix of all mental life, whether it be that of cognition in the form of ideas, of will in the form of purposes, or of imagination in the form of aesthetic sym bols. These latter, each in its own restricted and definitely limited way, are grounded in feeling; they are, moreover, accompanied by feeling, which seeks ever to incorporate them within itself and in turn to express itself through them. Thus feeling itself is boundless and infinite. Un fortunately, however, this infinite nature of feeling has often been regarded as a feeling of the infinite. When this has occurred religion has been interpreted as a relation to the transcendent. Once the fallacy has been seen, how</page><page sequence="23">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 303 ever, it becomes clear that religion, to command intellectual respect and grip the minds of men, must restrict itself to the bounds of humanity. While there are other versions of the bases of human istic religion which might legitimately claim attention, we must leave them unmentioned in order now to cast a back ward glance at those which we have just sketched. In the case of Natorp, it will be noticed, the transcendent is irre vocably banished; science, morality and art are given a very high degree of independence of the infinite matrix of feeling, and are allowed to move on mutually independent lines; religion, while completely detached from everything of a transcendent nature, still possesses a distinctive func tion, that of expressing the essential unity and harmony of the conscious life in all its typical activities, and of giving to the latter warmth even though not direction. The antithesis of the "is" and the "ought" led Kant to the postulate of a basic reality which, as the source of nature and of duty, affected their harmony; the very same anti thesis led Natorp to the doctrine that the world of scien tific knowledge and the system of moral imperatives are alike ultimately grounded in a unitary consciousness which has the form of feeling. The feeling itself is directly ex perienced in religion. Thus it is religion that establishes and reinforces the conviction that what volition develops as morally required must be possible in the world of being created by the activity of cognition. While Natorp de scribes his doctrine as religion within the bounds of humanity, it is clear that for him religion is not identical with social idealism or moral endeavor; rather does it testify to and reinforce the conviction of the essential unity and harmony of man's conscious life. Now Hermann Cohen, too, came with increasing clarity to differentiate religion from morality. At no time, moreover, did he</page><page sequence="24">304 THE MONIST advocate the elimination of the god-idea. Though holding that it corresponds with no actual being, he urged that, as in the case of the eighth century prophets of Judaism, it sustains the thought of the unity of mankind ; through it we are assisted beyond a quasi-atomistic conception of so ciety to a vivid realization of mankind as a totality within which the life of the individual falls. Moreover, the god idea expresses the postulate that the world presents no insuperable barriers to the development of human character but, on the contrary, offers the conditions requisite for an unending progress in morality. The individual as such, furthermore, namely in his thought of himself as an au tonomous and independent being, has needs which require the god-idea. He is conscious of himself as sinful and the function of god is to assure him of forgiveness and to restore him to the tasks of ethical freedom. Ill Auguste Comte's retention of the emotional, ceremonial and ecclesiastical aspects of Roman Catholicism might perhaps be explained as a lingering survival of forms im pressive even though antiquated, or as the expression of an unsound mind. Cohen's account of the necessity of the god-idea for ethical convictions, and for the concept of humanity as a reality and a supreme value, might be at tributed to an excessive preoccupation with, and an en tanglement in, the dualisms and the individualism of Kant ; and his doctrine of its necessity for freeing the individual from the consciousness of guilt and inspiring him to the free exercise of his moral vocation might be characterized as the death gasp of a pre-modern conception of human nature. Natorp's retention of religion as testimony of the unity of man's conscious functions and as guarantee of the conviction that fact and value, actuality and moral re</page><page sequence="25">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 305 quirement, are not permanently divorced might be charged with an arbitrary disregard of empirical observations and scientifically established facts. Press these considerations as far as we may, however, we shall still find that the refusal to deny a distinctive r?le to religion was due, especially in the cases of Cohen and Natorp, to the seriousness with which they faced the facts of religion as they present themselves in historical phe nomena and in living personal experience. That they held themselves within the limits they did might perhaps even be attributed to the restricted possibilities of the philos ophies to which they were committed. Otherwise it seems not impossible that they might have been led into the paths of Schleiermacher and those who, with this great Romanticist, have found it necessary to trace religion to an independent mental factor, whether a feeling of absolute dependence, creature feeling or a sense of the numinous; or of those who have believed it necessary frankly to rec ognize a religious a priori, whether in the transcendental critical meaning of Kant or in a psychological sense. Not merely a Schleiermacher, an Otto and a Troeltsch have thus stressed the uniqueness of religion. Even such think ers as Windelband and the Baden school, in spite of re sultant intellectual complications, have felt bound to acknowledge that religion carries us beyond the limits of theoretical, aesthetic and ethical experience as such. They have taught that it affords a mode of consciousness which forever precludes us from contentment with that which is or may be empirically actual, and that it holds before us the spiritual necessity of reverent compliance with an over-individual imperative. In the case of all of these scholars, the holy has the status of a category independent of truth, beauty and goodness, though this independence, to be sure, is far less pronounced in the case of Cohen and</page><page sequence="26">306 THE MONIST Natorp than in that of the other writers whom we have subsequently mentioned. For these latter, moreover, even as for Cohen and Natorp, though to a less extent, religion is not without intimate relations to science, art, and morality, for these all are expressions of the unitary life of mind and reveal features of concrete reality. The strength of recent humanism is in no small meas ure a by-product of man's amazing achievements since the rise of modern science, and of his confidence in the accel erating rapidity with which future successes are possible. Small wonder indeed that we find a widespread sense of power and of self-reliance. Nature has lost much of her stark terror ; things are seen as malleable materials for the realization of human purposes. Is it not, however, sheer blindness to deny that defeat is as genuine a feature of human endeavor as is success, and that even the success that may be gained in relation to nature and life is pre conditioned by an obedient regard for laws and structures that must be taken as fact? Whether we may properly speak of an instinct or innate tendency to submission is indeed disputable ; what is not so, however, is the fact that nature exhibits many stubborn features, some of them precarious and others bound, so far as can be seen, to frus trate the hopes of natural man. That one is living in such a wider world, within which fall such successes as human wit may achieve, inasmuch as of it the human individual is but a constituent, is an inevitable experience at the level of self-conscious reflection. With this experience comes a realization that in the interests of his own integrity, the individual must win an adjustment of his total self to this world, along with an increasing knowledge of its nature, appreciation of its beauty, and aspiration to express and enhance its life. The order of nature and the social realm are indeed</page><page sequence="27">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 307 theatres of action, and within them man, individually and collectively, may, through the power of intelligently and imaginatively guided effort, increasingly realize his voli tions. But only one such as a Fichte in his Jena years can seriously construe so much even as physical nature alone as but the sensuous material of our duty. For this the independence of our environing world is too pronounced and its claims for recognition and acknowledgement are too forceful. Let it not be said that helplessness is a state peculiarly characteristic of primitive man, as is therefore also the belief in gods; that the course of the past three centuries has given to man the right and the privilege of restricting his spiritual concerns to the discovery of fresh ends and of means for their achievement. Increased knowledge brings augmented power, but it likewise brings to the sober mind an intensified consciousness of that il limitedly vast order within which human action is but an incident, and by which there is sustained and made pos sible such action as does occur. What we have rapidly and roughly sought to sketch is the way in which that object emerges which carries upon it the indelible stamp of reality. And surely historical testimony and the witness of personal experience agree in the thesis that religion is a quest for the real such as the Hindu has voiced in his prayer : "Lead me from the unreal to the real; from darkness into light; from death into im mortality/' The concrete character of the reality which is the religious object depends in every given case upon the range and the depth of our experiencing, and upon the development of reflective knowledge. The relative strength of self-assurance may vary, as may that of other-reliance; such assurance and reliance, however, always dwell to gether. The call to moral effort and humanitarian devo tion may be insistent and inescapable, but with it comes a</page><page sequence="28">308 THE MONIST realization that final issues are outside the reach of predic tion and human determination, and comes also a confidence that these issues may be acquiesced in when judged, not by present hopes and values, but by the self which, through a rationally humble attitude towards reality and the religious object, through repentant realization of his own nature, and through spiritual effort, perpetually undergoes pro found reconstruction. Religion is distinct from the reflective pursuit of truth in that it affords a sense of a concrete and ultimate totality, which is a sense of reality: with entire truth has it been said that "the category of reality belongs not to science but to religion." It is distinct from the quest of beauty in that it arouses the moral passion and the capacity for dedi cated action. It is distinct from the life of humanistic devotion by the fact that it places this life within its cosmic setting and includes an adventure of faith which, however paradoxical the fact, nevertheless actually does afford a present enjoyment of the good, a prophetic realization of that which to moral aspiration is a distant goal. Certain notions of the transcendent came in the ad vance of science to be thrown into the discard. As a re sult hereof, and of the redirection of interest to present possibilities and fruitions, the specific emotions and atti tudes associated with these notions withered at their roots. There is, however, nothing in the scientific or philosophic teaching of today that forces the religious spirit to retreat from the reality that is sensed to be the most ultimate, and to protect and shelter its sensitive soul by restricting its consciousness! to the compass of practical concerns for human well-being. The most comprehensive body of truth afforded by modern science is neither of such a nature nor of such solidity and security as needs to frighten any but timid souls ; and philosophical criticism has reached a point</page><page sequence="29">NEO-PTOLEMAISM IN RELIGION 309 where, though disagreeing as to precisely what science is competent to yield, we may unite in holding that this may not be regarded as either final or absolute knowledge. The limits of science by no means extend to the boundaries of the real. Scientific advances but disclose more clearly the vastnesses of the unknown that lies beyond. Scientific me thods are abstract and thus afford results that are relative to the limited purposes underlying their use. Any adequate appreciation of these facts but confirms that sense of reverent wonder which at once vitalizes the spirit of re ligion and animates the labors of the philosopher. To man's apprehension of reality aesthetic experience must likewise make its full contributions. Like knowledge this experience ultimately roots in that total experience resulting when self-conscious man, in the full range of his receptivity, faces and appropriates the world within which he finds himself. And the fruits of art, as those of knowledge, will be absorbed by the religious experience, and will in due course fructify life and human culture as a whole. Ethical aspiration and living, too, have their sources in that matrix of experience which represents man's total appreciative reaction toward the reality ulti mate for him. Thus they acquire and retain their depth, and therefore will they issue in a comprehensiveness which in self-transcendence carries them beyond the frontiers of humanity to a reverent attitude towards the whole of life and reality, in the realization of a unity by virtue of which all are comprised within that cosmos which has come to consciousness in those bits of itself which are we. That feeling of oneness with the universe, reinforced by advanc ing science, experienced in the presence of beauty, and cul minating the morally earnest life when this is serious and comprehensive, reconstructive of its values, and conscious of its matrix, is in one of its expressions religion itself. Re</page><page sequence="30">310 the monist ligion has a cosmic reference. It reaches out beyond the world of realized knowledge and values to an encompassing whole. Science affords a large part of its creed and theology, though for religion, as for philosophy, this creed and theology are symbols and myths. Our purposes to reform our attitudes and practices, and to dedicate our powers to the specific requirements of that world which is expressed by and in ourselves, is the religious sacrifice. Our reverent wonder, our faith, and our unhesitating and unflinching submission are our worship. The call of re ligion, thus, is not to the confines of humanism and neo Ptolemaism, but to the wider reaches foreshadowed by the largest universe of present knowledge and the most comprehensive aesthetic and moral values as yet within our ken.
