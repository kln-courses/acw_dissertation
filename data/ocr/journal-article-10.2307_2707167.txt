<plain_text><page sequence="1">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY BY JEROME ROSENTHAL II It is generally believed that anti-historicism constitutes one of the most characteristic trends in the philosophy of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century rationalists, and that this trend received its deathblow at the hands of Hegel, the last great rationalistic philosopher of history. This characterization is obviously deter- mined by the modern conception of history as a descriptive and genetic account of cultural or social life. Thus conceived, history is like all significant studies an empirical discipline. And an empirical approach to man's history presents no methodological problems incapable of objective analysis. In fact it is legitimate to say that all significant knowledge and all empirical sciences are historical. This is true not only in the sense that eternal truths have no place in science, that scientific conclusions are relative to the data available at given periods, but above all in the sense that all evidence in empirical science is based on inferences and past experience and not on clairvoyance or direct, immediate, intuitive insights. The inferential nature of empirical evidence clearly implies that probabilities and conjectures, far from being peculiar to history and far from constituting a vice, are essential to all sig- nificant and fruitful knowledge. To be sure, certain superconscientious historians, afraid of contaminating their discipline with speculations and believing that it is the nature of an empirically oriented discipline to operate with self-luminous facts and to deliver irrefutable truths, have been in- sisting that history must be confined to statements about individual occurrences. Now the isolationism of these historians may have its roots in the teachings of traditional "sensationalistic empiri- cism." But whatever may be the case with this traditional em- piricism, it is quite compatible with an enlightened and critical empiricism to point out that history, like the natural sciences, is not to be identified with descriptive statements about individual and naked facts; in its perusal of subject-matter it is guided by theories, whether they be understood as interpretative assumptions 429</page><page sequence="2">430 JEROME ROSENTHAL or explanatory hypotheses or principles of selection. No violence is thus done to the spirit of a well-understood empiricism, so long as the assumptions are warranted by the material at hand, so long as the hypotheses are regarded as subject to revision, and so long as the principles of selection are taken as heuristic and regulative rather than as constitutive and artificially introduced from an irrelevant domain. The peculiar attitude of the modern rationalists towards his- tory can be understood primarily in the light of their conception of empiricism. For most of the modern rationalists history is the very incarnation of all the evils they impute to empiricism. This is particularly true of Descartes and Malebranche, and largely also of Leibniz. For Descartes and Malebranche history is devoid both of all cognitive worth and of any useful function. If dependence upon sensation and memory was a virtue for Hobbes' and led him to regard history as yielding absolute knowledge, this circumstance constituted a vice for the Cartesians. Complete reliance upon sensation, memory, and hence upon experience, implied for Des- cartes that the knowledge upon which history is based is merely of a probable, conjectural, contingent and therefore of a dubious nature. It is Descartes' conviction that "all science consists of certain and evident knowledge" and that probable knowledge is incompatible with it.2 The knowledge gained through the study of history leads us nowhere, not only because it is conjectural but also because it is acquired in a mechanical fashion through memory without requiring our reasoning powers. "The study of history, languages, geography, and of everything that depends exclusively upon experience gives us simple knowledge acquired without the aid of reasoning. "3 Descartes goes so far as to declare that "the knowledge of Greek and Latin can be no more incumbent upon an educated person than that of Swiss or Breton, and the study of the history of the Romano-Germanic empire is no more necessary than that of the smallest state of Europe."' Malebranche does not lag behind his teacher in this respect. "History, grammar, the laws and customs of particular countries, 'Hobbes, Leviathan (Everyman ed.), 41. 2 Descartes 1e?gles pour la direction de l'esprit, in Oeuvres choisies (Paris, Garnier Freres), 301. 3 Deseartes, Recherche de la verite par la lumie're naturelle, op. cit., 389. 4Ibid.</page><page sequence="3">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 431 and those disciplines which depend on the fluctuations of the human will contain nothing but contingent truths. "5 And as to the use- fulness of history, Malebranche does not hesitate to assert that a single principle of physics contains more truth than can be found in all the books of history.6 The primary if not the only function of history is to satisfy curiosity.7 But unlike the curiosity which leads to scientific research, the stimulus connected with the study of history is, in his opinion, aimed not at arousing reflection, or at dispelling ignorance, or at removing the veil of mystery from things, but at keeping the powers of reasoning in suspense through feeding the imagination with stories of marvels, extraordinary events, and bizarre facts. Malebranche speaks sarcastically about those persons who display no interest in what is going on around them and yet hunt continually for "histories of the rarest and most ancient occurrences, for surprising and exotic experiences which can never enlighten the mind. "' The anti-historicism of Descartes and Malebranche expresses itself also in the fact that they failed to realize another essential aspect of history, namely, its social and cumulative character. What above all characterizes the cumulative conception is the idea that even the most abstract realms of culture have careers in time, and that consequently the history of the development of these realms is essential to a full understanding of their present nature. For the cumulative conception teaches us to regard our cultural institutions and achievements not as born full-fledged but as prod- ucts of prolonged and tentative efforts having their roots in a deter- minate albeit varying social background. It is because Descartes and Malebranche failed to realize the cumulative nature of culture that their approach to disciplines like philosophy, religion, ethics, and science can be characterized as unhistorical. WVhile insisting that all the sciences are so inti- mately interconnected that "it is much easier to master all of them at once than to learn a single one separately, "9 a typical rationalist Malebranche, Recherche de la V'rit' (Paris, Flammarion ed.), Livre I, 25. 6 J2loge par Fontenelle, quoted from Bouillier, Histoire de la Philosophie Car- tesienne, II, 23. 7In order to make us concentrate all our reverence on God, Malebranche praises Descartes for having enabled us to "cease admiring the powers of mag- netism, the phenomena of the tides, the generation of meteors, etc." Recherche de la Verite, II, 353. 8 Ibid., II, 58. 9 Descartes, Be'gles pour la direction de l'esprit, Oeuvres, ed. Garnier, 300.</page><page sequence="4">432 JEROME ROSENTHAL like Descartes at the same time declares that a knowledge of the history of the sciences or of philosophy is uttSerly irrelevant to an understanding of them. He had little respect for those scholars who devote themselves to the study of Plato and Aristotle and who in this way learn history but not science.10 A combination of science with history can, in his view, lead only to a contamination of the truths and certainties of the former with the conjectures and probabilities of the latter.11 The most extreme form of the belief that the history of a discipline like philosophy is an utterly useless study is strikingly exhibited by Malebranche. " It is pretty useless for those who live now to know whether there ever lived a man called Aristotle; whether this man actually wrote the books to which his name is attached; whether certain passages in his work should be understood this or that way. " Malebranche, moreover, does not confine himself to exposing the futility of an historical approach to Aristotle. He ridicules in general those persons who " spend their time reading books in order to enter into the mental- ity of their authors, or in order to ascertain what these authors actually meant by certain of their opinions. ""I "Such persons," he continues, "learn to know histories and facts but not evident truths; the science apprehended by them is a science of memory but not of the intellect. " '14 The generating principle of all culture is for most modern rationalists "reason," a faculty infallible in its operations, ad- mitting, as Descartes says, of no degrees, manifesting itself wholly in every individual. There are no two or several universal rea- sons. Truth is necessary, immutably eternal. "Reason is the same in time as well as in eternity, the same in heaven as in hell. . . . The language of reason is neither French nor German; it is intelligible to all nations, to those who read as well as to those who do not read.

The only thing such individuals would need for completing the work of reason would be longevity.16 The belief that the work of reason is non- cumulative is very clearly stated in the following words of Lessing: "Education gives to man nothing that he could not evolve by him- self; it only enables him to arrive at ideas in a quicker and easier manner. "17 But perhaps the most striking expression of this view is found in Descartes. He goes so far as to assert that an intel- lectual construction or system evolved spontaneously by a single individual is more perfect, more harmonious, and hence more rational than a work resulting from the gradual and tentative efforts of numerous men. The prosperity of Sparta, he argues, was due to the fact that its constitution was "the invention of a single individual. I` Characteristic in this respect is the attitude of Descartes towards the problem of error. Error was regarded by him as a conscious expression of a desire to mislead. Far from ascribing to errors a heuristic value, far from regarding them as expressions of the provisional and tentative nature of so many scientific theo- ries and, in short, as an integral part of the self-corrective tech- nique so characteristic of all significant knowledge, Descartes looks upon them as manifestations of a bad will obstructing the natural growth of reason. Thus he admonishes us to rescue and preserve reason "as it is given to the individual by nature from the cor- rupting influence exerted on it by false opinions,"9 reminding us of the pristine purity of "the first germs of truth that were depos- Qui la presente au genre humain Que I'univers soit sa patrie. 16Kant sometimes expresses himself in a similar vein: "Under certain condi- tions a single individual, with a special aptitude for art and science, would be able to carry these disciplines much farther than would be possible for all the generations of scholars working in succession. This would be the case if our hypothetical indi- vidual were to attain maturity of judgment through prolonged practice and acquired knowledge, and if he were to retain the same youthful mental vigor throughout the period of time allotted to successive generations."

And just as he was convinced that a mature individual can attain truth by ''resolving to remove from his imagination all imperfect ideas,X'21 so did he believe that many authors deliberately hide their true and simple ideas behind a smoke screen of erroneous and complicated views in order to surround their doings with an air of mystery and in this way to over-awe the public. Thus the fact that the ancient philosophers required from their students a knowledge of mathe- matics makes him suspect that the ancients possessed a type of mathematics which was both easy and fruitful and hence different from the sterile discipline in vogue in his day.22 He also utters the suspicion that this true type of mathematics was known to Pappus and Diophantus, who however concealed it through a trick customary among artisans who refuse to divulge the secrets of their inventions in order to retain the admiration of the public.23 It is in accordance with these views that so many of the modern rationalists regarded the works of reason as born perfect and full- fledged. The date and place of birth did not matter much. Reason may have delivered itself of masterpieces in ancient Athens or Rome as well as in modern Oxford or Paris. Descartes and many of his followers had little use for art, probably because they found it difficult to apply a demonstrative technique to a qualitative subject-matter. They thus looked for models of perfection in the fields of mathematics, metaphysics, and theology. To question the truth and finality of Euclid was looked upon by certain Cartesians as almost a sacrilege: " Should a geometrician attempt to offer new propositions contrary to those of Euclid, should he claim, after the fashion of Hobbes, to have proven that this geometry is full of errors, I admit that it would be wrong to indulge in such innova- tions.1124 We also hear Leibniz speak about "models in the art of demonstration bequeathed by Greek mathematics to humanity," although he was quite aware of the formal defects of Euclid.25 In general mathematics was for most of the modern rationalists a 20 Regles pour la direction de lesprit, 312. 21 Recherche, 395. 22Re'gles, 311-312. 23 Ibid., 312. 24 Malebranche, Recherche de la verite, II, 25. 25 Leibniz, Nouveaux Essais, ed. Flammarion, 319.</page><page sequence="7">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONAIISTS TO HISTORY 435 repository of truths which are inalterable, completely independent of contexts, and given once and for ever. This is attested to in a most striking manner by Descartes. "There is only one truth con- cerning every object, and whoever finds this truth knows about the given object as much as one can know. Thus, if a child is trained in arithmetic, and if he performs an addition in accordance with the rules of this science, he can be sure to have found with reference to the sum under consideration everything that the human mind could discover. X 726 As to metaphysics, Descartes' attitude towards his own work is quite in harmony with what we have just pointed out. Referring to the metaphysical proofs and reasons he gave in his Meditations, he asserts that these reasons are of such a nature that he does not think that "there is any road by which the human intellect could ever discover better ones. X X27 Even with regard to physics he was convinced that the job performed by him in this field was so com- plete and final that there scarcely remained any unsolved problems. At the end of his Principes he declared that "no phenomenon of nature has been omitted in the explanations given in this trea- tise. X 28 To remove from himself the suspicion of conceit, Descartes resorts to a declaration which is perhaps the most characteristic expression of his anti-historicism. We hear him say that he con- sidered himself luckier but not wiser than other thinkers: "If other persons have not discovered the same things as I have, it is entirely either because they did not turn their eyes in the proper direction, or because they did not concentrate their thoughts upon the same objects as I. I no more deserve to be extolled for having made these discoveries than a peasant who by chance has stumbled upon a treasure which for a long time had remained undetected by numerous searchers. '2 The followers of Descartes may or may not have shared his view that his intellectual achievements were nothing but lucky discoveries, but they certainly were convinced 26 Descartes, Discours de la Methode, 16. 27 Descartes, Meditations metaphysiques, Epitre, 63. Cf. Kant: "The critical philosophy is subject to no fluctuations of opinion, to no improvements, and this philosophy rests upon a completely sure basis fixed forever and indispensable to all future generations for the best purposes of mankind."

A typical illustration of this is offered by Malebrancho. "The readers of Descartes will experience a secret joy in the realization that they were born in a fortunate age and country, saving us the trouble of hunting for a teacher of the truth in past ages and among pagans, in remote corners of the earth, among barbarians and foreigners. "30 What Malebranche says about Descartes is almost repeated by Voltaire with regard to Locke and Newton. "Locke is the Hercules of metaphysics, who has fixed the limits of the human mind. '3 "Newton pushed his work to the most daring truths which the human mind could ever reach. 7 32 The seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French poets and theorists of art were not hampered by metaphysical inhibitions concerning their profession. They found it easy to pay tribute to the spirit of their age by identifying the beautiful with the true and by preaching conformity with reason: Le vrai seul est aimable; Il doit regner partout, et meme dans la fable.33 Aimez done la raison: que toujours vos eerits Empruntent d'elle seule et leur lustre et leur priX.34 The gospel of reason advocated by Boileau and his followers stood for the observance of proportion and moderation, for faithfulness to nature, or to what is normal, what can be generally understood and approved of. This faithfulness also meant compliance with models valid for all ages and societies. For writers like Boileau the source of these models was largely to be found in Greco-Roman literature, while for Voltaire it was mainly located in the poetic works of the age of Louis Quatorze. The following verses ad- dressed by Boileau to writers engaged in idyllic poetry are typical in this respect: Suivez Theocrite et Virgile; Que leur tendres eerits, par les graces dietes, Ne quittent point vos mains, jour et nuit feuilletes.35 30 Malebranche, Recherche de la verite, II, 478. 31 Voltaire, Letter to Horace Walpole, July 16, 1768, in Lettres choisies (Gar- nier Freres), II, 86. 32 Ibid. n.d. 230. 33 Boileau, Ep. IX. 34 Boileau, L'Art Poe'tique, Chant I. 35 Ibid., Chant II.</page><page sequence="9">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 437 Voltaire, on the other hand, speaks of the perfect tragedies of Racine and the sublime scenes of Corneille, in comparison with which all the Greek tragedies seem to be school exercises.36 Vol- taire not only applies the epithet "perfect" to his favorite poetic works but also, in a truly unhistorical fashion, characterizes them as the first inventions of their kind. Thus we are told that Corneille " created the tragedy, " and that Moliere both " invented and made perfect the comedy, and that the works of the latter surpass the comedies of all ages. "37 From a strictly rationalistic point of view the future is as irrelevant to the operations of reason as is the past. If it is true that reason admits of no degrees, that the works of reason are born, by good luck, perfect and full-fledged, then the past qua past is no more to be either extolled or denounced than the future qua future. Good luck would not be good luck if it had a special predilection for any particular instance of time. It is however a fact that such a strict and rigorous logic is scarcely adhered to by any of the protagonists of rationalism. Descartes was the first to violate this logic. At times he seems decidedly to favor the past at the cost of the future. According to a theological doctrine current in his day, human nature gets more and more corrupted with the passage of time, and reason consequently deteriorates.38 Whether or not Descartes consciously adopted this version of the fall of man, there can be no doubt that he sometimes expressed himself in a manner greatly reminiscent of this dogma. We have seen him above insist- ing upon restoring reason as it is given to the individual by nature. As the ages pass by, so he argues, man is progressively plagued by book knowledge, a breeding-source for errors which corrupt the mind and dim the natural light of reason. Descartes goes so far in this direction as to assert that the naive and simple-minded ancients, precisely because they were guided by the natural light of reason, formed true ideas about philosophy and mathematics, although they were yet unable to understand perfectly these sciences.39 36 Voltaire, Letter to Walpole cited in note 31. 37 Letter to Baron de Faugeres, May 3, 1776; cf. also letter of note 32. 38 Cf. Bouillier, op. cit., I, 482-3. Bouillier does not quote directly from the author or authors of this doctrine, but refers to the writings of Arnauld, who vehe- mently attacked the thesis of the increasing corruption of reason. Curiously enough it did not occur to Bouillier that Descartes was himself tainted with this doctrine. 39 Descartes, Regles etc., 312.</page><page sequence="10">438 JEROME ROSENTHAL Most frequently, however, Descartes speaks a different lan- guage. We have heard him declare above that the study of the past is a waste of time.40 We also hear him say with regard to his own achievements that he would have arrived at his ideas and would have written what he wrote even had he never read anything.4' This in itself does not of course involve a blanket repudiation of the past, and consequently a breach in the rationalistic position. All that it implies is the idea that the ancients were not lucky enough to have anticipated his views. Descartes, however, jeopard- izes his rationalism when he asserts that it is the moderns who are the true ancients, because the world is older to-day and because we have more experience than our remote predecessors.42 The predi- lection for the future implied in this assertion he sometimes carries to such an extent as to speak of the progress of science destined to bring about an ever growing amelioration of man's physical and moral nature. The distinction occasionally drawn by Descartes between the past and the future became a clearly marked tendency in the hands of his followers. The idea that the moderns are the true ancients is again and again resorted to by Malebranche in order to vindicate the present and the future. The following is a typical statement on his part: "It stands to reason that we should regard Plato and Aristotle as more ignorant than the modern philosophers, because in the present age the world is two thousand years older, and be- cause we have more experience than the ancients had."43 This idea moreover formed the basis for the famous controversy which raged in the seventeenth century in France between the so-called moderns, or those who proclaimed the superiority of modern intel- lectual achievements over the works of classical antiquity, and the ancients, or those who maintained the converse view. The moderns were mostly recruited from the ranks of the Cartesians. Some of the moderns-Malebranche, Perrault, Lamotte-questioned the value not only of the philosophy and science but also of the poetry of classical antiquity. Others either confined themselves to ex- tolling the immense progress achieved by modern philosophy and science (Arnauld, Nicole), or made an exception for the poetry of 40 See above pp. 430, 432. 41 Bouillier, op. cit., 38. 42 Ibid., 482. 43 Malebranche, Recherche etc., I, 251.</page><page sequence="11">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 439 classical antiquity by regarding art as not subject to the vicissi- tudes of time (La Bruyere, and particularly Fontenelle)." It must be insisted again that the Cartesians' bestowal of a privileged status upon the future can scarcely be justified in terms of the rationalistic premises they held. To be sure, some of the seventeenth-century thinkers who called themselves Cartesians were really more empirical than rationalistic. But there can cer- tainly be little doubt about the scant regard which both Descartes and Malebranche had for sense-experience. When therefore these two thinkers made experience as it grows in time yield a superior type of knowledge, and a superior metaphysical knowledge at that, they were obviously deviating from their doctrine of the self- sufficiency of reason. It is true that a greater stretch of time may bring about an increase in the number of individuals engaged in intellectual pursuits. But to be consistent with the principles of rationalism one should assert with Leibniz that a hundred persons judge no better than one person, just as a hundred horses run no faster than one horse.45 Furthermore, to say, as Descartes sug- gests in his Discours de la Methode, that in the past reason was unable to assert itself because of the dominance of the passions, is to indulge in a circular argument. For this is ultimately tanta- mount to maintaining that at certain periods of history people did not proceed rationally because they were then irrational. And to refer to lack of leisure as an obstacle in the path of reason is to disregard the fact that leisure is mostly a result of the rational organization of society. The truth of the matter is that the peculiar attitude assumed by certain modern rationalists towards time was quite often moti- vated by considerations which had little to do with reason or logic. This was particularly the case with Malebranche. His opposition to the past was largely determined by several extra-logical factors. In the first place, to extol the past in general meant in his eyes to open the door to a competitor for the monopoly on tradition, which, as we have already seen, he had assigned to religious faith. To encourage the study of the past or of history, a discipline he thought utterly lacking in demonstrative evidence, thus meant for him to induce people to accept on faith traditions other than and directly opposed to those presented by Christianity. Malebranche 44Bouillier, ch. XXIII of vol. I. 45 Leibniz, Nouveaux Essais, 469.</page><page sequence="12">440 JEROME ROSENTHAL frankly appeals to psychology in order to show the pernicious effects which things of a hoary antiquity may produce upon the human mind. "There are numerous persons who look with so much curiosity and respect upon everything coming from antiquity . . .that their minds become enslaved, for we do not dare question and place ourselves above what we admire. '46 In the second place, the past meant for Malebranche specifically the world of classical antiquity. In the enthusiasm for Greek and Roman literature, in the cult of classical learning and scholarship which had spread over the Western world ever since the days of the Renaissance, he saw a challenge to the moral outlook of Chris- tianity. For he feared that an intimate association with this literature, gained through an intense study of its linguistic, geo- graphical and other purely external aspects, might lead its devotees from a concern with form to an interest in content. In other words, what he feared above all was the possible contamination of the Christian public by the naturalistic, humanistic and secular spirit inherent in the classical world-view. He openly warns against the danger presented by the "wicked customs" of the ancient world to which persons not given to reflection might easily succumb.47 Small wonder that we hear him declare that humanity would sus- tain no great loss if a fire were to destroy all the works of the ancient poets and philosophers.48 In the third place, the repudiation of classic antiquity served in the hands of Malebranche and of other Cartesians as a signal for a campaign to divorce Christian theology from the philosophy of antiquity, and especially, from that of Aristotle. The marriage between Aristotle's philosophy and Christian theology had been relatively easy to effect in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Science, which supplies theology with its cosmological doctrines, had scarcely advanced at that period beyond the position where Aristotle had left it. But this union had become extremely pre- carious in the seventeenth century, after most of Aristotle's scien- tific work had been discredited by the intellectual revolution that started with the Renaissance.49 It is true that teleology occupied 46 Malebranche, Recherche etc., II, 210. 47 Ibid., I, 239. 48 Bouillier, op. cit., I, 481. 49 How strong the reaction against Aristotle had become in the seventeenth cen- tury can be seen from the fact that Catholic thinkers like Arnauld and Nicole found</page><page sequence="13">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 441 a central place in the philosophy of Aristotle, a circumstance par- ticularly calculated to gratify a theology committed to a belief in a wise Providence. It must however be kept in mind that Aris- totle 's teleology was essentially an immanent one, and that in gen- eral all efficacy is for him domiciled within nature itself. And it was precisely the aversion for this dynamic naturalism that on the one hand determined to a large extent Malebranche's opposi- tion to Aristotle,50 and on the other made him as well as other Car- tesians hail the mechanistic system of Descartes, which by divesting nature of all independent power lent itself to the implication that God is the sole active agent in the universe. It is also true that certain aspects of Aristotle's cosmology, such as the geocentric doctrine or the conception of the hierarchical structure of the universe, harmonized well with scriptural accounts or with Christian dogmas. But the fact is that these supports for Christian theology were outweighed not only by the challenges raised by the new science against the whole structure of Aristotle's physics, but also by the presence in Christian theology of certain dogmas-the creation of the universe in time, the doctrine of the immortality of the human body as well as of the soul-which were in direct contradiction to the teachings of the Stagirite. Christian theologians always managed to handle recalcitrant facts or doc- trines by resorting to rationalizations. Now if these theologians can with an easy conscience explain away, for instance, the Biblical imputation of human passions to God by asserting that the prophets knew better, but that they had to adapt themselves to the mentality of their audience, why should it not be legitimate to save the helio-centric doctrine by applying the same device to the famous order given by Joshua to the sun to postpone its setting? This is exactly what Malebranche does. Those who are puzzled by Joshua's order, he argues, "do not realize that the purpose of it necessary to disown him in their Port-Royal Logic, a work which adhered closely to the principles and details of Aristotle's logical writings. In justification of their procedure they pointed out that Aristotle had forfeited the right to be respected, since truth requires a universal agreement which Aristotle's system no longer com- manded in the chief countries of Europe. (Bouillier, op. cit., II, 214.) 50 Malebranche deplores the respect for pagan philosophy responsible for the pernicious doctrine that things can produce effects through their own natures. On the other hand, Descartes he extols for having recognized that "all natural laws con- cerning the communication of motion are nothing but the results of God's immutable will."

Do not the believers in the helio- centric doctrine say that the sun rises and sets when they speak to their valets or friends ? ""' One who looks at things from the perspective of these seven- teenth-century rationalists may legitimately ask the following ques- tions: If so many theologians set themselves the task of squaring the Scriptures with philosophy, why must this philosophy be that of Aristotle, a thinker whose cosmology has become obsolete and whose moral outlook utterly lacks the austerity and otherworldli- ness so characteristic of Christian ethics? Why should not this philosophy be that of Descartes, a thinker who has constructed his system with an eye upon the church and whose scientific doctrines can satisfy both the learned and the unlearned? For is it not a fact that a Dutch follower of Descartes, Joannes Amerpool, gave the title of Cartesius Mosaizans to a work in which he tried to establish the complete identity of the vortex theory with the account given in Genesis ? Theological considerations, which as we have just shown played an important part in determining the opposition of certain Car- tesians to the past, were also largely responsible for the insistence on the part of these thinkers upon the genuineness and even su- perior status of the future. It may seem rather odd to see con- servative Catholic thinkers like Arnauld and Nicole champion the reality of the future in order to justify the occurrence of novelties. But this championship ceases to be strange when we discover that the novelty which mattered to them above all was the creation of the world in time. To deny the occurrence of novelties thus meant to them to contradict a fundamental Christian dogma.53 It is also to save this dogma that Malebranche declares the universe to be finite with respect to the past and infinite and eternal with regard to the future. For to say, so he argues, that the world is eternal with regard to the past is to believe that things are independent of God, and is thus to question his power. On the other hand, to assert that the world is finite as to the future, and consequently to 51 Ibid., II, 112. 52 Bouillier, op. cit., I, 266. 53 Ibid., 482.</page><page sequence="15">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 443 believe that it is subject to annihilation, is to doubt the constancy and immutability of God and to admit that he is susceptible of repentance.54 By whatever extra-logical considerations the Cartesians may have been guided, it is a fact that as early as the second half of the seventeenth century they stated in unmistakable terms the doctrine of progress and human perfectibility. A series of writers- Arnauld, Nicole, Perrault, La Bruyere, Fontenelle, Terrasson- formulate and re-formulate this doctrine. The empirically inclined Arnauld frankly admits that he is concerned not so much with reason, which for all he knows may be identical in all ages and in all human beings, as with its applications. He accordingly limits himself to stating that human knowledge becomes more perfect with time, and that modern philosophy and science are superior to those of the ancients.55 Nicole takes his cue from the occurrence of novelties, which he infers from the large number of inventions made by human beings during the short period -000 years-of recorded history.56 For Perrault the idea of progress is verified by the advances made by the human mind since the creation of the world in the various sciences, in the crafts and arts, and in morals.57 For most of these thinkers the idea of progress is not only a gen- eralization derived from a survey of empirical data but also a deduction from a metaphysical theory. Thus according to Ter- rasson the progress of the human mind proceeds as naturally as the growth of plants or of other organic beings. The development of humanity follows for him a natural law similar to the one which makes an individual become wiser and more experienced as he grows older.58 Most Cartesian advocates of the idea of progress, however, resort to cosmic explanations, which to be sure are noth- ing but introjections of biological analogies into the structure of the universe at large. We hear that the development of humanity corresponds to that of the universe, and that the latter goes through the stages of childhood, adolescence and manhood. Utilizing an idea current in the seventeenth century to the effect that the career of the human race can be imagined as analogous to that of a single 54 Malebranche, Recherche de la ve'rite', II, 368; cf. also Bouillier. 55 Bouillier, op. cit., II, 153. 56 Ibid.

"" Other seventeenth- century writers, Fontenelle primarily, are not content with stating in general terms the scheme of the three stages; they also attempt to fill out these stages with a specific content. Thus Fontenelle declares that in its childhood humanity was absorbed in meeting urgent material needs; in its adolescence, a stage characteristic of classical antiquity, it devotes itself chiefly to the cultivation of objects pertaining to the imagination, such as art; in its maturity, which is represented by the present age, it is concerned above all with the pursuit of reason as expressed in the sciences.60 The seventeenth-century speculations about progress betray on the part of their authors a naivete of approach and a scant realiza- tion of logical difficulties. The idea of novelty, which serves for Nicole as the basis for his belief in progress, is incompatible not only with the alleged self-sufficiency and timelessness of reason but also with the very purpose for which it was invoked. Unless one is ready to relegate all bad things to the past and reserve all good things for the future, one has no warrant for the belief that in the future things will become better and more perfect. But if one were going to make such an assumption, one would be bound to imply that the future is predetermined, at least so far as its direc- tion is concerned, and in this way to jeopardize the belief in novelty.6" Analogous considerations apply to the parallel drawn by the seventeenth-century writers between biological and cultural regularities."2 If one has a right to speak about a natural law of growth, one should be entitled by the same token to refer to a 59Ibid., I, 485. t6 Ibid., I, 486. 61 It is worth noting that Malebranche also plays fast and loose with novelty and necessity. In order to account for the reality of time he resorts to Descartes' theory of continuous creation. He has however no qualms about bestowing upon God the constancy and immutability which he had removed from the material world. 62 The belief in a correspondence between cultural and cosmic development has no logical connection with the doctrine of three stages. Extrinsically this belief was meant to square with the Biblical account, which synchronizes the emergence of man with the creation of the universe. Intrinsically it was evidently intended to endow cultural history with a regularity resembling that of the material world.</page><page sequence="17">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 445 natural law of decay. Are not both growth and decay equally char- acteristic of organic beings? Similarly, it is obviously arbitrary both to stop with the stage of manhood and to identify the present age with this stage. Fontenelle seems to have been aware of at least a part of this difficulty. Instead, however, of attempting to solve this problem, he simply re-affirms his faith in human perfecti- bility and in the scheme of the three stages, as can be seen from the following: "It is too bad that this beautiful comparison [be- tween biological and cultural development] cannot be pushed to its logical end. But I must admit that this individual, who is assumed to have lived from the beginning of time up to the present, will never experience old age, that he will always be able to perform the things pertaining to youth and particularly those suitable to man- hood. In other words, to give up allegories, I must assert that mankind will never degenerate. C3 The doctrine of the three stages, and particularly the identifica- tion of the present age with the highest stage of manhood, brings into a glaring light a clearly marked teleological orientation. For just as a child is from this point of view regarded as a potential man, so the earlier stages of historical development are justified as preparations for the later ones. It is true that an individual cannot reach manhood without passing through childhood. This however does not entitle us to assert that childhood has no intrinsic significance or value of its own. The assimilation of the history of humanity to the three stages revealed by the biological develop- ment of the individual thus implies that the past is to be evaluated neither in so far as it is important per se, nor in so far as it is capable of throwing light upon the present, but only in so far as it does not anticipate values cherished in the present. II The attitude towards history of another great rationalist, Leib- niz, is more profound and also less consistent than that of Descartes and Malebranche. Like so many rationalists, Leibniz distinguishes sharply between a higher and a lower type of knowledge. The former expresses itself in what he calls truths of reason; the latter in truths of fact. The truths of reason are strictly universal and eternal; they constitute the basic principles of mathematics, meta- physics, ethics, jurisprudence, and natural theology. The truths 63 Quoted from Bouillier, op. cit., I, 487.</page><page sequence="18">446 JEROME ROSENTHAL of fact have their source in the contingent, individual, local and temporal circumstances presented by sensations, memory, and ex- perience in general. It is noteworthy that as a criterion for truths of reason Leibniz chose not the Cartesian psychological categories of certainty and evidence, but the strictly logico-mathematical ones of demonstrability and necessity. Demonstrability operates ac- cording to the law of identity, while necessity is governed by the law of contradiction (necessary truths are those whose opposites are self-contradictory). These remarks serve to show in what sense Leibniz is or is not to be charged with the sin of anti-historicism. This sin manifests itself primarily in the fact that Leibniz leaves no place for histor- ical considerations in dealing with truths of reason. He not only exempts these truths from all change and development but also assigns them a validity that cannot be affected by attempts to trace their origins back to non-rational sense-experience or by indica- tions of their non-ubiquitousness or even non-existence. For sense- experience in Leibniz's view can serve only as the occasion for rational knowledge, or at best as verifying and exemplifying what has already been established by reason. It can never serve as proof. "If one has noticed these occasions [of scientific truths] and re- tained for posterity the memory of them-a very useful thing-such details would play a considerable r6le in the history of the arts but would not be adequate for making them the basis of systems."64 Leibniz is equally explicit in insisting that the mere fact of the existence or non-existence of the truths of reason is no warrant for and no refutation of their logical justification. "The meaning of justice is independent of the existence of persons who practice it or in whose behalf it is performed, just as the relations obtaining between numbers would remain true even in case there were neither counting persons nor things to be counted."6' The distinction drawn by Leibniz between a realm of possibility as the source of timeless, necessary, and demonstrable proposi- tions, and the world of existence as the home of temporal, con- tingent, and probable truths, plainly suggests a tendency that is compatible with a well-understood empiricism. For on the one hand recent scientific empiricists have been advocating the view 64 Nouieaux Essais (Flammarion ed.), 364. 65Leibniz, Hauptschriften zur Grundlegung der Philosophie (hrsg. von Cas- sirer), II, 504.</page><page sequence="19">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 447 that a priori propositions, or what Leibniz calls truths of reason, are not subject to experimental verification or refutation, that they are analytical and tautological since they are governed by the principle of identity or are true by definition. It is true that these empiricists have been confining these propositions to mathematics, whereas Leibniz finds them also in ethics, natural law, and natural theology. But this simply means that he has rendered a wider range of propositions tautological, and hence harmless. On the other hand, the Leibnizian distinction obviously implies the em- piricistic thesis that history shares in the assets and liabilities of all existence. Leibniz actually declares that the "real existence of things that are not necessary is a matter of fact or of history. ' 2" If history is not a demonstrative and hence perfect science, it at least finds itself in respectable company, for we are told also that ''physics in its entirety will never become a perfect science."66a Moreover, the fact that history deals with contingencies and proba- bilities does not, according to Leibniz, entitle us to deprive it of cognitive value. Unlike Descartes, he asserts that "opinion based on probability also deserves the name of knowledge," for Leibniz was perspicacious enough to realize that probability was not a matter of subjective opinion, but in his words "must be derived from the nature of things."67 Surprisingly enough, he even goes on to say that he has "often been wondering whether the art of estimating probabilities would not be more useful than a large part of our demonstrative sciences. 2"68 The fact is, however, that the Leibnizian system is shot through with inconsistencies. It would be out of place here to show how he first separates the realm of possibility from that of existence and then fuses the two, how he regards existential disciplines now as based on experience and then as grounded in reason, how he insists upon plurality, individuality, external relations, as well as upon universal interconnectedness, continuity and internality of rela- tions. Suffice it to indicate that Leibniz most often identifies rationality not only with truths established demonstratively but also with purposiveness.69 It is through teleology that he tries to 66 Nouveaux Essais, 248. 66a Ibid., 402. 67 Ibid., 320. 68 lbid., 320. 69 Ibid., 425.</page><page sequence="20">448 JEROME ROSENTHAL save for reason the things which in his empiricistic moods he was ready to regard as irrational. It is through teleology, which he imports under the dignified name of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, that he undertakes to show the rationality of the spatio- temporal world in general and of individual contingent things in particular, something which can be accomplished neither by logico- mathematical procedures nor by empirical knowledge. The Prin- ciple of Sufficient Reason can alone tell us why events happen the way they do and why things are what they are.70 To be sure the Principle is not only teleological but also theological, for com- plete knowledge of contingent, individual, spatio-temporal exis- tents, involving as it does an infinite number of factors, is possessed by God alone. God alone sees "the ground of all the predicates which can be truly asserted about a given person," so that "it is impossible for a limited intelligence to foresee accurately the course of events."'`1 If this is the case, then human knowledge of matters pertaining to existence is not much furthered by the fact that God knows it all, and is therefore doomed to remain forever on a low empirical level. Nevertheless the true significance of the Principle of Sufficient Reason may be said to reside not so much in the question whether rationality is thereby achievable, as in the fact that it brings to light certain specific objectives having nothing to do with empiricism. For it is in an unmistakably teleological spirit that Leibniz asserts that the universe is an ordered whole and not a chaos, that everything in it is organically interconnected, that nature is uniform and constant in its operations. Applied to history, the cardinal r6le assigned by Leibniz to final causes in his insistence upon uniformity, organic unity and coherence72 makes for prediction, but also for a determinism so rigid and inclusive that no place is left for novelty or specificity. His pre-formationism73 shows that there is no place for novelty and specificity in a system which assimilates the relation of cause and effect to that obtaining between ground and consequent, a system in which time, change, and development are logicized. "Temporal sequence forms a series, sharing with all other series 70For a statement of the principle of sufficient reason, cf. Leibniz, Haupt- schriften, I, 124 and II, 443. 71 Ibid., II, 503 and 144; ef. also I, 91. 72 Ibid., II, 224. 73Ibid. II 248.</page><page sequence="21">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 449 the fact that the law of the series already indicates the end which must be reached in our further progressions."74 Very little justice is done to change when Leibniz asserts that "from the nature of particular things there follow results which are valid for a definite time."75 For in this view both the occurrence and the duration of the chang,es are predetermined by the structure or nature of the things under consideration. The pattern for all development is found by Leibniz in the unfolding of pre-existing potentialities which he ascribes to living things. " Plants and animals spring from pre-formed seeds; they therefore represent nothing but transforma- tions of pre-existing living beings. 76 It is in agreement with this that he again and again asserts that the present is pregnant with the future. That these assertions meant for Leibniz more than the idea that our predictions have their basis solely in the evidence derived from our knowledge of the present and past, can be judged from the following: " In virtue of metaphysical grounds everything in the universe is so connected that the present contains the future in its bosom. "'I Although Leibniz claims to have confined himself to an imma- nent teleology, he often speaks a language plainly betraying a crude anthropomorphism. "If an object lends itself to advan- tageous uses, we can say with certainty that when God created it, he had in mind among other things these uses as a goal, that he foresaw them and aimed at them."78 It is this external teleology, the attempt to evaluate the past from the point of view of the "advantageous uses" which Leibniz reads into it, that character- izes his approach to the specific problems of history. He recom- mends the study, as well as an appreciative interpretation of ancient systems of philosophy, so as "to make them as far as pos- sible self-consistent," for this would serve as an antidote to the "passion for destruction" and "vain quest for innovations," and would lead to firmly established propositions and to ultimate prin- ciples.79 Again he attributes great importance to the study of sacred history as a support to the foundations of revelation.80 74 Ibid, II, 338. 75 Ibid. 76 Ibid., 427. 77 Ibid., 75. 78 Ibid., I, 295. 79 Ibid., I, 256. 80 Nouveaux Essais, 419.</page><page sequence="22">450 JEROME ROSENTHAL Leibniz was one of the first to emphasize the importance of the comparative study of languages. He explicitly ridicules those philosophers who "speak with contempt of philology." "Since languages are the most ancient monuments of nations, antedating written documents and the arts, they serve best to show the origins, affinities and migrations of peoples."81 This tends to suggest that the importance of philology lies for our philosopher purely in the satisfaction of intellectual curiosity. But the study of languages involved more than that for Leibniz. Realizing that German has many words in common with most of the ancient and modern Euro- pean languages and even with Iranian, Leibniz jumps to the con- clusion that these words are German, the mother of them all.82 He accordingly appeals to his countrymen to cultivate and study their native tongue, because this would among other things redound to their glory, especially as it will become apparent that the origin and fountainhead of Europe's essence are largely to be sought among the Germans (bet uns) .83 Having assumed in common with most rationalists that human nature remains always and every- where essentially the same, that virtue and vice cut across temporal boundaries, Leibniz regarded history as a school of practical wis- dom disseminating and teaching useful lessons by examples. "I should like to see persons endeavoring to derive from history what is most useful, viz., extraordinary examples of virtue, accounts of what is conducive to good living, instances of political and military strategies. I should like to see a universal history written with such an end in view. 184 III It is noteworthy that a philosopher like Hegel who is reputed to be the apostle of historicism shared with these seventeenth- and eighteenth-century rationalists, and for similar reasons, their hos- tility towards so-called empirical history. Hegel explicitly de- clares that this sort of history belongs to the same class as natural history, geography, medicine, etc., disciplines which are essentially descriptive and which are determined not by reason but by the external play of contingencies.85 Like the other rationalists Hegel 81 Ibid. 82 "Unvorgreifliche Gedanken, betreffend die Ausuibing und Verbesserung der teutschen Sprache," in Leibniz, Hauptschriften, II, 533-4. 83 Ibid., 535. 84 Nouveaux Essais, 420. 85 Hegel, Encyklop. im Grundrisse (Rosenkranz ed.), 46.</page><page sequence="23">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 451 believes that empirical history, based as it is on memory, testimony, etc., yields narrations and not demonstrations, and consequently has little or no cognitive value. When it comes to discredit things which he does not like Hegel becomes particularly squeamish and extra scrupulous. Thus he forbids empirical history to make any generalizations, to trace similarities between the present and the past, or to transcend what is immediately given. "Each temporal period is distinguished by such peculiar circumstances, presents so unique a situation, that all inferences drawn from it must be based exclusively upon the period itself."86 In reality, however, there is for Hegel no such thing as an empirical history. He pokes fun at those writers who claim to be nothing but pure historians be- lieving that it is possible to dispense with general philosophic con- siderations and to treat their subject in a completely impartial manner.87 "Even the ordinary and mediocre historian who alleges that his attitude is purely receptive, and that he is guided exclu- sively by what is given, even he brings along with his thought cate- gories of his own through which he sees existing conditions. He who looks at the world rationally is in his turn looked at rationally. ' 88 To be sure, if by general philosophic considerations he under- stands interpretations of facts through theories and hypotheses, and if by partiality he means principles of selection guiding the historian in the labyrinth of his data, then all this is quite com- patible with a well-understood empiricism, as we have pointed out above. Hegel, however, means something more than this. For we hear him assert that all history worthy of the name must be teleo- logical, that purposes are indispensable in this discipline not only in the subjective sense as guiding the historian in the selection of his material, but also in the objective sense as expressing the rationality inherent in the events themselves. "A history without a purpose in this twofold sense would be an idiotic enterprise, not to be compared even with nursery tales, for even children demand that their stories should present an interest, that is, a purpose which can be guessed, and to which actions and events can be re- ferred. "89 It is needless to point out that the distinction drawn 86 Philosophie der Geschichte (Reklam ed.), 39. 87 Encyklop. im Grundrisse, 452. 88 Philos. der Geschichte, 44. 89 Encykl. im Grundrisse, 453.</page><page sequence="24">452 JEROME ROSENTHAL here by Hegel between objective and subjective purposiveness can scarcely be justified in the light of the subject-matter and function he assigns to history. For in this light the historian is to be guided in the selection of his material neither by the purpose at hand nor by the nature of his subject-matter, but by prescribed norms which tell him beforehand what to do and what not to do, and which ulti- mately have their roots in Hegel's own preconceived ideas. We hear him say that history must not be eclipsed by objects unworthy of it, by an intrusion of minor and particular occurrences. "The essential traits of the spirit of each age are always contained in major occurrences."90 The historian would violate the ideal of objective truth, we hear Hegel argue, if he were to be concerned with the description and even with the authentication of truths about "external existences and contingencies." It is obvious that what is worthy and what is unworthy of historic treatment, what is major and what is minor, what is essential and what is unessen- tial, what is external and what is contingent, are here determined by a normative scheme arbitrarily imposed upon the flux of events confronting the historian. It is equally obvious that a history complying with this program is anything but an empirical history. Untenable as the Hegelian distinction between empirical and philosophical history9" is, it nonetheless serves to focus attention upon certain methodological problems and concepts which tran- scend the narrow limits of traditional historiography, e.g., the ideas of continuity, progress, novelty, etc. These methodological problems became central in the nineteenth century as a result of the attempts made by historians to give to their discipline a wider scope than that assigned to it by seven- teenth- and eighteenth-century rationalists. The modern approach to history is characterized not only by the cumulative but also by the organic conception of history. By the organic conception we understand the view that man's various cultural activities form an interconnected whole. Although this conception has gained wide currency in recent years through the work of Spengler, it was in fact clearly formulated by Hegel. The various cultural domains are in the words of Hegel expressions of a common substance or spirit. This substance is identified by 90Ibid., 454. 91 A similar distinction was made by Kant in his Idee zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte, op. cit., 19.</page><page sequence="25">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 453 Hegel mostly with what he calls the Volksgeist. "The Volksgeist is the common principle underlying the religion, political constitu- tion, morality, legal system, science, and technical achievements of a given people."92 The organic view on the one hand is a reac- tion against the vagueness and empty generalities of history con- ceived in universal and monistic terms. It stresses the uniqueness, specificity and plurality which characterize individuals of a higher cultural order, viz., historic epochs, national, class or racial groupings. On the other hand, this conception attempts to make of history a genuine science by differentiating it from a mere sequence of events, by endowing it with an inner coherence and rationality, and by insisting on the similarities obtaining among the diverse aspects of a given cultural whole. The insistence on similarity implies that every aspect of a given culture expresses after its own fashion the spirit or essence of the whole, that it has bearings on every other aspect, e.g., disciplines like politics and technology are as essential to an understanding of metaphysics and religion or ethics as the latter are to an under- standing of the former. Consistently carried out the stress upon uniqueness implies that there are as many religions, philosophies and moralities as there are cultural wholes, and that it is as meaningless to speak of one universal religion or morality as it is to speak of one form of poli- tics or art. Thus the organic view teaches us to regard ideas, beliefs, institutions as relative to determinate cultural contexts. It serves to warn us against the attempt to read modern ideas into ancient civilizations, against the belief that institutions can be freely transplanted from one age or culture to another, against the tendency to speak of the history of poetry or of philosophy in gen- eral. The organic conception of culture is on the whole alien to the spirit of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century rationalists. Their tendency to see embodiments of eternal truths not only in mathematics but also in ethics and jurisprudence, their belief in universalism as revealed in their doctrines of natural rights, the religion of reason, the unity of mankind-all this is directly anti- thetical to a pluralistic and relativistic conception of culture. Again, the habit of separating existence from essence, of origins 92 Philosophie der Geschichte, 107.</page><page sequence="26">454 JEROME ROSENTHAL from validity, expresses a formalism according to which the various cultural domains are entirely independent of one another, and are consequently to be understood exclusively in terms of their imma- nent structures. So far as Hegel is concerned, it must be said that his philosophy of history is both inconsistent and ultimately self-defeating. First, he too extols eternal truths as the ultimate basis of all philosophy. Secondly, far from adhering consistently to the pluralistic con- ception of unique cultural wholes, he posits a supreme cultural constellation which presides over the destiny of the individual cultural wholes and towards which they all converge as their goal. "Europe is the goal of all history. . . . The Germanic prin- ciple is the reconciliation and solution of all contradictions. " Hegel speaks not only of a Volksgeist but also of a Weltgeist. This implies that the relations between the various cultural monads are not external but internal, and that ultimately we are left with a cultural monism instead of the intended pluralism. But even if Hegel had faithfully clung to cultural pluralism, his organic con- ception of history would still be essentially anti-historical, and thus self-defeating. It is certainly true that Hegel had very little use for temporal development. Temporal distinctions, we hear him say, can have no interest for thought.93 Such "poor" distinctions as past, present and future are asserted by him to have their proper place in the subjective realm of memory, fear and hope.94 To base history on mere temporal change is, in his view, to offer us a spec- tacle of aimless drifting, of an external play of contingencies. He explicitly declares that the concept of evolution connoting temporal development or the temporal rise of higher biological species out of lower ones, is nebulous and unworthy of reflective thought.95 In nature evolution can mean nothing but self-development.96 Simi- larly, cultural development is ultimately of a logical nature, de- noting an unfolding or actualization of potentialities. "Just as the seed or germ contains in itself the whole nature of the tree, the taste as well as the shape of its fruits, so do the first manifestations of the spirit contain the whole of history."97 What takes place in 93 Werke (Berlin, 1840), VII, 33. 94Encyklop. im Grundrisse, 217. 95 Ibid., 209. 96 Werke, op. cit., XIV, 305. 97 Philos. der Gesch., 52.</page><page sequence="27">ATTITUDES OF SOME MODERN RATIONALISTS TO HISTORY 455 all development is, according to Hegel, a transition from the im- perfect to the perfect, from the abstract to the concrete. It is true that development within a given culture requires time. But the duration, direction, and objects of this development are for Hegel determined beforehand by the existence of potentialities present from the very beginning. The fact that these cultural wholes or monads are characterized now as organisms, now as substances, plainly indicates he fashioned them after the pattern of either the prevalent pre-formistic biology of his day or of the traditional belief in timeless essences. Thus Hegel's organic philosophy of history far from doing justice to specificity and uniqueness turns out to be a rigid ironclad framework leaving no place for change and novelty, and consequently, for a genuine scientific approach to history. While there are serious reasons for questioning the logical com- petence of the organic conception to yield an adequate foundation for history, the cumulative conception provides a more adequate scientific approach to history. Hegel, undoubtedly, was the first to give a clear philosophic expression to the cumulative conception of history. It was Hegel who used the term "transcendence " to signify the fact that earlier stages of cultural process are surpassed but not annihilated, that they survive in a transfigured form. But at the same time it must be pointed out that insofar as he repudiated the idea of temporal development, he could not consistently adhere to the cumulative conception of history. For if he had taken the latter seriously, he would not have spoken of eternal truths, he would not have sung such paeans to the absolute truth with which philosophy is alleged to deal, nor would he have dismissed questions of origins as en- tirely irrevelant to the understanding of religion and even of law. Finally, it is important to realize that with regard to the idea of progress, Hegel continued in the teleological rationalistic tradition. It is true that he repudiates the eighteenth-century belief in prog- ress and the indefinite perfectibility of mankind, but this repudia- tion was grounded on his own teleological conception of history. The idea of infinite progress is for him the very embodiment of contradiction. The concept of infinite perfectibility in its turn "is as vague and indefinite as the idea of change in general. "' The 98 Philosophie des Rechts (Glockner ed.), 95.</page><page sequence="28">456 JEROME ROSENTHAL notion of perfectibility is meaningless unless we specify a definite goal as a terminal point for all history. For.the term infinite im- plies an open universe, whereas the concept of progress presup- poses a closed and predetermined universe. It is noteworthy that Hegel exhibits the idea of progress as independent of time. For he is convinced that he can get rid of contradictions by conceiving development as oriented towards a definite goal, and by divesting the idea of progress of all temporal associations. Hegel indeed seems to achieve here a rational system in which freedom and necessity are organically synthesized. Freedom is secured by the presence of purpose, and necessity by the absence of time. It is, however, evident that the rationality achieved is of a kind from which Hegel would have shrunk in horror had be been willing or able to realize the full implications of his doctrine. For what we have here is a formally self-consistent and tautological system. It is needless to point out that Hegel's procedure is circular and arbi- trary. He explicitly says that development to be meaningful must be conceived as guided by a purpose. But this is plainly tautologi- cal. Since purposeful is for Hegel equivalent to meaningful, this statement actually implies that development to be meaningful must be meaningful. Hegel is arbitrary here not only because of the specific goal-the triumph of the Germano-Christian world-view- which he makes the goal of history, not only because he was so naYve or so arrogant as to believe that the universe exists in order to bring about the triumph of the things he liked most, but also because he would have been just as arbitrary and circular had he selected any other goal. For to assign a goal to history essentially means to make history yield the things which have previously been put into it. New York City</page></plain_text>
