In an approach that combines archaeological context, textual accounts, and symbolic inference, Dr. P. Dransart ofthe University of Wales, Lampeter presents a short study on a miscellaneous group of Inkaic period figurines. The goal of the study is ambitious: how do we interpret the deeper meanings of objects from archaeologically-known cultures? The author sets out to look at one category of artifact ? miniature anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines manufactured of precious metals and Spondylus shell ? in order to highlight Inka visual representations ofthe natural elements, and Inka relationships with their sacred landscapes and religious practice. Dr. Dransart examines various aspects of the objects including their clothing, as well as their archaeological context (when known), and textual sources referring to Inka systems of belief. Figurines have been found throughout the region of the central Andes that once pertained to the Inka empire. Along with miniature pottery vessels, figurines are known from the Isla de la Plata off the coast of Ecuador, and most spectacularly, from high altitude shrines, located on or near the summits of extinct volcanoes, as well as from other contexts. Such figurines were part ofthe assemblage of goods found with the Inka Tce Maidens' by Johan Reinhard and his colleagues in 1995, on the slopes of Ampato, near Arequipa. Both male and female figurines have been found at these shrines, and often the figurines are fully clad in carefully worked textiles. One of the strengths of the discussion is Dransart's use of textual sources. The rigorous manner in which the author questions the written sources of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is exemplary. Dransart critically analyzes the discrepancies between accounts of the colonial administrators and religious authorities, and the physical evidence, as well as inconsis- tences between the writers themselves. The hypotheses that the author proposes are perhaps ultimately unverifiable, but the questions she raises are tantalizing. One suspects that pairing the meaning of the figurines with Inka natural philosophy is appropriate. It is interesting to note that the discovery of the Ampato figurines, known after the publication of this study, seems to support in a rather dramatic fashion, some of Dransart's interpretations. For example, she highlights the significance of thunder, lightning, and related deities embodied in the symbolism of the figurines. Loftier powers may be confirming this association: lightning bolts that ripped through one of the Ampato figurines are leading some scholars to suggest that metal figurines were intentionally placed on peaks to attract lightning. Greater care might have been afforded the editorial overview of the manuscript. Numerous references are missing from the bibliography, and the illustrations and references are confusing on occasion. Three ofthe figurines are illustrated and a fourth is shown in a colour plate. Overall, this small study is extremely thorough and scholars interested in the current locations of the objects will find the appendices a useful source.
