Newberry Library, Chicago. 'Historic Maps in K-12 Classrooms', a national web-based educational program using historic maps to teach the geographical dimensions of American history, was launched at the end of 2003. Construction of the website was supported in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities &lt;http://www.newberry.org/kl2maps&gt;. The Norman B. Leventhal Map Center. The Center, at the Boston Public Library, opened on 8 October 2003, 'to preserve, catalog, study and exhibit the BPL's historically significant collection of 350,000 maps. These include European, world maps and atlases, as well as American maps focusing on New England, Massachusetts and Boston, from the 1 5th century to the present'. ftsterreichische Nationalbibliothek (Vienna) . From June 2003 to August 2005, five librarians will re-catalogue the historic holdings of cartographical mate- rial (approximately 260,000 items) in the Map Depart- ment and Globe Museum. This huge work is generously sponsored by Sparkassen Versicherung AG. Those records will then be accessible via the online Austrian National Union Catalogue. Paper and Virtual Cities: new methodologies for the use of historical sources in virtual urban cartography. A research programme, begun in August 2003, financed by the Netherlands Organisation of Sciences (NWO), the University of Maastricht and the University of Groningen, using material in the Bodel Nij ennuis Collection, Leiden University Library, and elsewhere, to develop new methods for analyzing and annotating digital town plans and virtual reconstructions of cities with historical information &lt;http://mani.let.rug. nl:8080/pvc/template/EN/index.xml&gt;. Repertoire des historiens de la cartographic Compiled by Catherine Hofmann and with 91 entries for historians resident in France or nearby countries, this appeared in he Monde des Cartes (Revue du Comite francos de Cartographie) 175 (March 2003): 43-89.

Switzerland. ( 1 ) The Swiss Federal Office of Topogra- phy (Swisstopo) and ten other Swiss libraries have begun to scan the 'Siegfriedkarte' (the former National Map series) involving about 4000 different sheets/editions (see Cartographica Helvetica 28 (2003): 50).

The Biblioteca National of Argentina reported in July 2003 that it had suffered the theft of more than 120 maps dating from the 16th to 18th centuries. See an article, in Spanish, from the Buenos Aires La Nacion newspaper, reproduced on the archive of the ExLibris list &lt;http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/mailing-lists/ exlibris/2003/07/msg00045.html&gt;. The ExLibris list is a good place to look for information about rare book and map thefts. United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. A new archive repository for more than 2.5 million individual records at its Taunton headquarters was opened in November 2003 by the Duke of York and named after the former Hydrographer to the Navy, Rear Admiral G. S. [Steve] Ritchie. United States map collections. From October 2003 to March 2004, the Map and Geography Roundtable (MAGERT) of the American Library Association carried out an online survey to gather information for the third edition of the 'Guide to U.S. Map Resources' (previously published in 1986 and 1990), to be edited by Christopher J. J. Thiry. Waldseemuller. In June 2003, the Library of Congress completed its $10 million purchase of the 1507 Waldseemuller world map from Prince Johannes Waldburg-Wolfegg. In November, the Jay I. Kislak Foun- dation of Miami Lakes acquired the companion map to the famous 1507 map, Martin Waldseemuller's Carta Marina (1516). This is still bound in the original portfolio along with a set of 16th century globe gores by Johann Schoner and was appraised at $5 million. The Kislak Foundation was established to foster greater awareness of the history and cultures of the Americas. Jay Kislak has stated that, eventually, the Carta Marina will in all likeli- hood rejoin the 1507 Waldseemuller map at the Library of Congress. Meanwhile, the Foundation will conduct research into the map and exhibit it in 2004. Web images. Images of non-current maps are being constantly added to the web. The best way to find those is via the 12 sections of 'Images of early maps on the web' &lt;http://www.maphistory.info/webimages.html&gt; (whose 600 entries can be searched via the particular month or year they were added) or via the Site Search facility on the homepage of the 'Map History' site &lt;http://www. maphistory.info. The Web Projects page has more than 40 entries &lt;http://www.maphistory.info/projects.html&gt; (most of which are concerned with the scanning of early maps). Western Pacific Archive. The archive, from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London, was trans- ferred in 2002 to the University of Auckland, New Zealand. The archive covers FCO material from 1877 to 1978, including maps &lt;http://www2.auckland.ac.nz/lbr/ speccoll/pr.htmx William L. Clements Library. The map catalogue is being gradually converted and included in the University of Michigan's MIRLYN system. At the end of 2003, some 2,200 records had been converted (7 per cent of the maps of the Americas). The records can be assessed via the MIRLYN link on the Map Division homepage &lt;http://www.clements.umich.edu/Maps.html&gt;, selecting 'Library Catalogs', 'UM Clements Library'. 4. EXHIBITIONS Increasingly, the web is being used to mount exhibition images, with varying amounts of commentary. The best place to locate these is via the 'Map History' site. They will be found on either or both of the following: 'Images of early maps on the web' &lt;http://www.maphistory.info/ webimages.html&gt; and 'Web articles and commentaries on specific topics in the history of cartography' &lt;http://</page><page sequence="7">Chronicle 229 wrww.maphistory.info/webtexts.html&gt;.
