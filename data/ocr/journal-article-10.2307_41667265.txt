Bennett If one looks today at a map of the region around Petra, in eastern Jordan, one gains little idea of the great importance which this city possessed in ancient times. Petra was the capital of the kingdom of the Nabataeans, who, in the three centuries before Christ and the two which followed, built up one of the greatest trading kingdoms in the Middle East. They became masters of all the North Arabian routes ; along these were brought the spices, gums, scents, silks and other luxuries so much in demand by the Greeks and the Romans. Petra lay almost in the center of this vast network of routes, which ran from South Arabia to Damascus and the Mediterranean; it became the greatest emporium of its time. At the height of its territorial expansion in the first century b.c. the Nabataean kingdom stretched from Damascus to Meda'in Saleh; it also included a large part of the Negeb of Palestine and had harbors on the Mediterranean. This vast territory was ruled during the first half of the first century b.c. by Aretas III, a king who was sufficiently influenced by Greek culture to be called the "Philhellene." It was probably at this time that Petra began to take on the aspect of a Hellenistic city. It was inevitable that the kingdom controlled from Petra should arouse the cupidity of the Roman Em- pire. Apart from its importance as a buffer state be- tween the nomadic tribes of the Arabian hinterland and the settled coastal regions, its great wealth was a magnet. Throughout the centuries just before and 233</page><page sequence="2">MAP SHOWINO THE POSITION OF PETRA. NABATAEANS continued after Christ it combated all attempts to bring it under the Roman aegis, and the Nabataeans waxed pros- perous under able, shrewd leaders. It was only when the royal power weakened under their last ruler, Rab- bel II, and when the Roman Empire was controlled by one of its greatest empire-builders, the emperor Trajan, that this proud kingdom lost its independence. Petra was finally incorporated into the empire in A.D. 106 as the province of Arabia. Thereafter, Petra be- gan to acquire all the attributes of a Roman town - a colonnaded street, a theater, temples and baths - and it differed from other Romanized eastern towns only in its unique setting. In the late third century the economic and political difficulties which beset the empire as a whole were re- flected in Petra; gradually it sank into obscurity. A Greek inscription in the Urn Tomb, dated to A.D. 447, refers to the consecration of a chapel by a bishop of Petra, but by the time of the Muslim invasions, in the seventh century, the city was only a shadow of its former greatness. Two twelfth-century Crusader castles in the vicinity attest to a transitory interest in the area. Thereafter, for six centuries, Petra lay forgotten. In 1812 the young Swiss explorer John Burckhardt penetrated its fastnesses and slowly Petra became known to the outside world as a weird, fascinating place, with extraordinary monuments carved out of the living rock - testaments to a long departed, sophis- ticated civilization. Petra lies in a basin about twenty miles northwest of Malan and about sixty miles, as the crow flies, north of the Gulf of Aqaba. East and west of it rise sand- stone mountains and craggy cliffs, dominated on the west by Umm el-Biyara, "Mother of Cisterns," some thousand feet above the floor of the basin. From the western edge of this great peak extends the whole panorama of the Wadi Arabah. A natural, almost im- pregnable fortress, this mountain has been identified with biblical Sela, stronghold of the Edomites. North and south of the basin rise gaunt hills cut by deep wadis, accessible to men and pack animals but difficult terrain for staging a surprise attack. The cliff faces are honeycombed with caves and rock shelters which were useful for storing the Nabataeans' precious cargoes. The multi-colored striations of blue, white, yellow and black give the sandy rocks a scenic brilliance and magnificence. The colors change with the play of light so that Petra never presents the same aspect for more than a few minutes. This ever-changing color presents a challenge to the photographic skill of vis- itors, whose number daily increases. With the setting sun they depart; the echoes of the clatter of horses' hooves and the shrill cries of the Arab guides gradu- ally die away. Night falls swiftly; the mountains be- come dark-purple to black, with a glow here and there from fires within the Beduins' caves and tents. Petra retires once again into its secret world. The usual approach to Petra today is from the east. The path follows the winding, downward course of the wadi through a pleasant valley, where the first of the Nabataean rock-cut tombs are to be seen on either side of the path. Gradually the rocks close in and the path narrows. This is the Siq, where close observation reveals traces of the large stones which once paved the entire route. In Roman times a dam was thrown across this narrow gorge and the flood waters of the wadi were diverted away from the road.

As the rock walls soar to a height of nearly one hundred meters and curve inwards, the light dimin- ishes until only an infinitesimal slit gives an indica- tion of daylight. At the western limit of the seemingly endless Siq, which centuries of gushing waters have carved out, one of Petra's most beautiful monuments comes into view. The Khasneh, or Treasury (dating probably from the second century A.D.), protected from the elements by its girdle of rocks, is one of the finest preserved examples of Romano-Nabataean archi- tecture, carved from the living rock. The impression it makes on the traveler when he emerges from the Stygian darkness of the Siq, or when the sun's first rays suffuse its façade with a warm rose-red color, is unforgettable. From here the path widens and many more ex- amples of rock-cut tombs may be seen, ranging from the austerely simple to the magnificent but sometimes overpoweringly ornate façades such as that of the Palace Tomb. Glimpses may also be had of Nabataean cult monuments. Carved in the sides of the tombs and on the plain rock faces are small niches, often containing a rectangular block of stone or an obelisk, symbol of the chief Nabataean god, Dushara. Else- where, steps or paths lead up clefts to the summits of the nearby mountains, on several of which are open- air sanctuaries, the "High Places'' of the Nabataean religion. It was Petra's funerary architecture which, in the late nineteenth century, aroused the interest of such scholars as Briinnow and Domaszewski, whose work, Die Provincia Arábia, remains a classic. Subsequent research, notably that of Wiegand in 1916, also tended to concentrate on the architectural remains, though in this case more attention was paid to the free-standing buildings, which we now know to be associated with Petra's incorporation into the Roman empire. While adding much to our knowledge of its art and architecture, these works did not make a sig- nificant contribution to understanding of the history of Petra as a city. Archaeological excavation began in the early 1930's, but the main interest at that time was not primarily the city area. In addition, excavation tech- niques were not yet sufficiently advanced to enable the establishment of a detailed stratigraphie picture of the city's history. From 1954 to 1956 the Department of Antiquities of Jordan sponsored a program of clear- ance and preservation in the heart of the city. A long stretch of the main Roman street, with remains of buildings on either side, was uncovered, but analysis of the stratigraphy was outside the scope of the work. A detailed knowledge of Petra's history and of the development of Nabataean material culture was still lacking. The chief aim of the recent excavations has been to fill this gap. In particular, stratified evidence ha$ been sought of the city's history while it was still the capi- tal of the independent Nabataean kingdom. Excava- tions were inaugurated in 1958 by the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, under the direction of Peter J. Parr. For part of the 1959 season the work was carried on jointly by the British School and an American group; Dr. Philip Hammond (then of Lycoming College) was Assistant Director. In 1959 and I960 the Department of Antiquities of Jordan also cooperated, owing to the active interest of its Director, Dr. Awni Dajani. The main street of Petra follows the course of the Wadi Musa, which runs westward through the heart of the city. Little now remains standing of the many buildings which once rose up on terraces on either side of the paved, colonnaded street. The only sur- viving free-standing monument of any size is a temple of the second century a.D. known as the Qasr el-Bint, which is approached from the street through a triple- arched gateway. Trenches excavated alongside the street disclosed the earliest remains, a series of walls resting on sterile gravel. Made of wadi boulders and terre pisée (rammed earth) , these belonged to small rectangular rooms. The floors are of beaten clay; a conical clay oven was found in this level.. Accurate dating of these structures must await detailed study of the pottery. The evidence, however, of imported black-glazed lamps and of the coins of Aradus in Phoenicia - locally minted Nabataean coins are not known until the first century b.c. - suggests a date in the third century b.c. Preliminary study of the pottery and coins associated with successive building phases implies that this primitive type of building did not go out of use until the early first century B.c. No other examples of this type of construction have been found anywhere else in Petra. These early levels also revealed objects which are highly important for the light they throw on Naba- taean religious practices and on the association of these people with far-flung areas. Several small in- cense burners of stone or clay were discovered, similar to others from Mesopotamia, southern Arabia and southern Palestine but differing in the decoration, which is much less elaborate on the Petra examples. Where it exists it is a simple design impressed or 237</page><page sequence="6">The earliest structures found in recent excavation: stone and clay walls, third century B.C. NABATAEANS continued incised on the sides. Cubes or obelisks carved to rep- resent deities are common at Petra and are known at other Nabataean sites such as Meda in Saleh and in the Wadi Rumm. Unique, however, are crude portable stone idols. Comparison with "face idols" from the Hadramaut and the Yemen suggests connections with those areas. At some time in the first century B.c. the inhabit- ants of Petra became conscious of town planning and of the superiority of solid stone structures over their primitive buildings. Increasing contact with the Hel- lenistic world may have inspired in them a desire for a more sophisticated way of life. The first requisite was to extend the area available for building, and an artificial terrace of loose gravel, some fifteen meters broad, was built against the northern side of the earlier buildings, along the bank of the wadi. Part of this increased width was used for a road running parallel to the wadi. This was resurfaced with gravel many times before a colonnaded street was superim- posed in Roman times on exactly the same line; the deposit from these resurfacings is 1.50 m. thick. Between the gravel roads and the edge of the wadi have been found the remains of a row of buildings of well dressed ashlar masonry, the exact sequence of which has yet to be elucidated. Two facts are certain, however: they belong to the same general phase as the gravel road resurfacings, and they were roofed in the "arch and slab" technique, hitherto known mainly in Byzantine contexts in the southern Hauran (for ex- ample, at Umm el-Jemal) and in the Negeb at Sbeita and Abda. That the beginning of this technique dates back at least to Nabataean times is now proved. Complementary to the work on the street was the excavation of another area, in the southern part of the city. From the street - the city's main artery - the ground rises sharply until it overlooks the Wadi Farasa, which is the southern boundary of Petra. This high ground, known locally as Katuteh, levels out to form a plateau which has been formed in part by use as a rubbish dump. Excavation revealed a house which had been com- pletely covered by Roman rubbish tipping, a circum- stance which helped preserve the walls to a height of over three meters. Apart from some buildings ex- cavated at Dhiban and at Abda, this is the only Naba- taean free-standing house known. The house plan comprises a narrow central court some thirty meters long, with smaller rooms opening off the two long sides on the east and west. The imposing main en- trance (2.75 m. wide) is in the north wall, that is, on 238</page><page sequence="7">Three of the incense burners which were found in early levels. Each is 7-8 cms. square and has a shallow, recessed upper surface. Crude anthropomorphic idols found in early levels at Petra. the city side. A smaller entrance lies to the west of the main door. On the south side there are no signs of doors or windows. This suggests that the back wall of the house might have been incorporated into the city's defences, for this wall lies on the crest of the steep slope leading down to the wadi ; unless an arti- ficial platform had been built over the slope this was the only possible defensive line. The eastern and western walls of the building, of fine ashlar masonry, present an imposing appearance externally. Far less attention was paid to the interior faces. The cross-wálls also show the same lack of at- tention, but this was certainly deliberate. Many frag- ments of painted wall plaster, both molded and plain, prove that these interior walls were faced with an or- namental stucco veneer. This is a technique well known in Hellenistic and Roman architecture; the house at Katuteh illustrates the fusion of Nabataean and foreign building methods. In the western rooms small pilasters project from the centers of the cross-walls, possibly to support a roof in the "arch and slab" technique. However, since no voussoirs or slabs were found, the possibility of a wooden roof cannot be excluded. There are two drains: one leads from one of the west rooms to a covered outlet beyond the main west exterior wall; the other drained water from the courtyard through an outlet beneath the main entrance. The house was built on top of a deep fill of strati- fied rubbish which contained sherds of imported terra sigillata . These, together with other pottery and coins, suggest a date of about a.D. 25 for its construc- tion. The house continued in use, with various repairs, alterations and modifications, throughout the first cen- tury. When the pottery and the coins have been studied, a close dating should be possible for the structural changes. It is certain that the house was abandoned about A.D. 106. One visualizes the proud, 239</page><page sequence="8">Left: Hie main western wall of the Katuteh house, looking north; the wall in the foreground is a later addition.

NABATAEAN* continued wealthy Nabataean owner of this fine residence re- senting the loss of his capital's independence and re- moving himself to an area where the Roman presence was not so acutely felt. The abandonment of the house suggests that the southern limits of the town contracted after the Roman annexation, and a recent study by Mr. Parr of the town walls on the northern perimeter of the site shows that the city area was re- duced in this direction as well. During succeeding centuries the abandoned build- ing at Katuteh was occasionally used by squatters, who erected crude cross-walls at various places, especially in the western rooms. They were makeshift affairs which could well have provided temporary mangers for animals. Perhaps also to this period should be ascribed infant burials in pots, found against some of the cross- walls. Later the building was used by the Byzantines as a burial ground, after thé walls had been completely covered by rubbish. The hundreds of objects found in and under the building are important for tracing the development of Nabataean culture and for assessing the extent to which it was influenced by contact with the Oriental, Hellenistic and Roman worlds. The lamps, many of them locally made, clearly show western influence. Over one hundred were found in the house, including some fine examples of imported Roman ware of the first century A.D. The clay figurines, many representing camels and horses, also illustrate the steady absorption of Classical influences by the Nabataeans. The pottery, however, is of the greatest importance. The chronology of its development has never before been established; this is one of the major aims of the current work. Of eggshell thinness and at the peak of its development akin to the finest porcelain, it is one of the Nabataeans' greatest achievements. So much pottery has now been found in stratified levels that it is at last possible to trace accurately the full develop- ment of this unique ware. The earliest painted ex- amples come from trenches beneath the Roman street and under the Katuteh building, but a considerable quantity was also found in a homogeneous and ex- tensive tomb group. It first appears during the first century B.c., and the shapes of the vessels - shallow curving bowls for the most part - recall contemporary Hellenistic pottery. The decoration, however, is some- thing new. In its earliest period the floral and leaf patterns are applied in a light red-brown paint to the pink surface of the rather creamy clay, with an almost feathery brush-work of the greatest delicacy. During the middle period, covering most of the first century a.D. and part of the second, the designs become less 240</page><page sequence="9">Nabataean pottery. A, B: Two bowls of the early period.

The decoration on the latest examples is even more conventionalized, and the now almost black paint is applied to the vessels in a heavy-handed fash- ion ; this style probably belongs to the third century. Throughout all this time shallow bowls and plates continue to be the commonest painted shapes, though cups and juglets are also found. Although the link with Hellenistic ware is clear, close parallels are hard to find. The forthcoming publications of Nabataean material from Dhiban and Abda should help ma- terially to solve this important problem. So common are painted sherds that they tend to distract attention from the plain Nabataean pottery, which is almost as fine. On the whole, the vessels are similar to contemporary Palestinian pottery, but sev- eral shapes seem to be uniquely Nabataean, notably a narrow cup with a wide, flat rim, a small basket- shaped vessel and a so-called "inkwell," whose exact function is not known. While the trenches on the Roman street and on Katuteh have provided the most important evidence, several smaller areas have also yielded interesting in- formation. One trench was dug in the road at the foot 241</page><page sequence="10">Part of the triple-arched gateway, looking east. Much of the debris has been removed by the Department of Antiquities. NABATAEANS continued of the triple-arched gateway, which before work be- gan was buried in debris to a depth of several meters. The function of this gate has been variously interpreted as the main entrance to the city from the west, as a triumphal arch dedicated to a Roman emperor or as the monumental entrance to the precincts of Petra' s most important temple (Qasr el-Bint). The present excavations have proved that the third interpretation is correct. The evidence lies in the agreement of the gateway's orientation with that of the temple and its close similarity in architectural decoration, as well as in the fact that emplacements for doors were found, showing that it was a true gate, not just a triumphal arch. The period of the gateway, which had also been in dispute, has now been established. Its plan, with four free-standing columns on pedestals, shows that it can hardly date before the reign of Hadrian and is more likely to be Antonine or Seveřan. This agrees well with the stratigraphie evidence, which proves it to be later than the colonnaded street. The fact that no coins later than A.D. 106 were found beneath the street sug- gests that it is of Roman construction. This is borne 242</page><page sequence="11">The round cobbled area of the small bath house on the northern periphery of the site. out by the street's affinities with others and by an im- portant inscription found in 1956 (see a preliminary notice by D. Kirkbride in Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, IV-V [I960] 120). This seems to belong to a building bordering the colon- nade; it dates to A.D. 114. Such a date is probable for the laying out of the street as part of a building pro- gram inaugurated within the Roman provincial town that Petra had become. An architectural study of the Qasr el-Bint by G. H. R. Wright ( Palestine Exploration Quarterly, 93 [1961] 124-135) provided an opportunity to sink a trench at the northeast corner of that building in order to establish its true floor levels. Contrary to pre- vious belief, the temple stood on a podium about two meters high. The front part of this had evidently been faced with white marble veneer, of which one large slab still remained in situ. The surrounding area was paved with limestone blocks all the way east to the triple gate. Much of the podium, including the steps leading up to the temple, had been pillaged later for building purposes. The suggestion made earlier that domestic buildings might have been incorporated into the defences of the Nabataean city is reinforced by a discovery made in a small trench laid down in the northern part of the city overlooking the Wadi Abu Olleqa. Remains of a stone building were found, with its western wall lying on the presumed line of the city wall, just as in the case of the Katuteh building. Another interesting feature of this building was a small circular cobbled area, with six pilasters placed at regular intervals around its wall. The presence of drains suggests that this formed part of a small bath-house in a residential building, which appears to have been in use in the first century A.D. As we have said, knowledge of Nabataean archi- tecture has hitherto been restricted largely to the fu- nerary monuments of Petra. The present excavations have helped to redress the balance. The Nabataeans begin to emerge as architects for the living as well as the dead. When the study of all that has been found is completed, a fuller picture can be painted of these people who came mysteriously from the desert to build up one of the great merchant kingdoms of history and to offer their own special contribution to the culture of mankind.
