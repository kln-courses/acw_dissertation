<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEUS EX MACHINA IN EURIPIDES. IT has long ago been pointed out that the use of the deus ex machina by Euripides has been the cause of a good deal of misunderstanding,, but in spite of the more enlightened. critics, the misunderstanding is still glibly repeated, as by Laurand.as recently as 1914 in his Manuel des Etudes Grecques et Latines (II. 224), 'Apr's des perip6ties souvent fortuites le ddnofiment se fait par un deus ex machina.' In face of this it may be well to attempt to clear up the whole question, for there can be no doubt that some ancient dramatists did misuse the contrivance, and it figures more frequently in the extant plays of Euripides than anywhere else. That it was commonly misused is sufficiently attested by (I) Cicero, De Natura Deorum I. xx. 53, 'Quod quia quem ad modum natura efficere sine 1 E.,g. by Haigh : 'The use of this contrivance in Euripides has been much misrepresented by the critics. It has generally been described as the last resort of an unskilful dramatist, when he is unable to find any other solution for the complexities of the plot.'--Tragic Dranma of the Greek ', p. 245.</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW ii aliqua mente possit non videtis, ut tragici poetae, cum explicare argumenti exitum non potestis, confugitis ad deum'; (2) Plato, Cratylus 425d ('00ep o~ Tpa~ypowo7o~o 7'reLLVd'E 7t dTropoo-w dV"~L a( ? Xav~d Icaraen "ovtL 9eovS aLpov- resv; and (3) the Horatian injunction: nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus inciderit (A .P. 191.) About this last I shall have something to say shortly; none of the three mentions Etiripides, who uses the deus ex machina exactly ten times more fre- quently than any other tragedian whose works have survived! Yet critics have brought Euripides under the censure which the ancients themselves refrained from applying to him, simply because Aristotle instanced, the Medea as show- ing a bad X;o-tv T70o Vt^Oov.

It is obvious that the Xto-V' must not be d'7o ' rflavmp, if the ingxav~j be used, as the quotations from Plato and Cicero prove it to have been used by tragedians generally, and as Aristotle misunderstood Euripides to use it, to get the tragedian out of difficulties otherwise unsurmountable. But Euripides is. so far from using the p7rxav' to solve the complexities of his plots1 that he actually uses it to com- plicate them. This is so both in the Helen and in the Iphigeneia in Tauris, where, when the plot is proceeding smoothly to its natural denouement, the adventitious aid of a storm at sea has to be called upon in order to provide an excuse for a divine epiphany. But the best instance is provided by the Heracles, where we have a unique intervention, not at the end, but in the middle of the play. Heracles has returned from the underworld and rescued his wife and children from the hands of Lycus; their tragic situation is over, and all seems to be going well, when suddenly the forms of Lyssa and Iris appear dror 1k7Xav47, and Heracles slays them all under the influence of heaven-sent madness! Here, at any rate, is no XIo-tv 70"o Llov! Obviously Euripides uses the atiXavj for purposes other than those which brought it into such discredit as is witnessed by the remarks of Plato and Cicero. Let us try to determine what these were. In the Hippolytus the beautiful speech of Artemis, 'with its solemn rebukes and tender condolences, is tempered throughout by an air of serene and lofty tranquillity, such as befits the utterances of the immortal gods,'* and suggests that possibly the pXxav77 was deliberately used by Euripides to pro- duce a consummation of that ica'apo-ts of the emotions which Aristotle re- garded as the function of tragedy to effect through pity and terror-a tribulation and refinement of the spirit, which Milton expressed so well when he concluded his Samson Agonistes with the lines: His servants he, with due acquist Of true experience from this great event, With peace and consolation hath dismiss'd, And calm of mind, all passion spent. In some sense it seems to be used as a means of expressing divine approval, or disapproval, upon the actions of men. In this play the fortunes of Theseus are thus moralised by Artemis: his lack of intention acquits him to a certain degree, and so does the fact that he was deceived by Phaedra. We are made to feel that his fate is but part of the tragedy of human life-in which the good are not always rewarded-and that, in any case, the gods take no joy in the misfortunes of the eLo-Ee/,etv: rh Uav &amp;lpa'apriav Tr oh) Eivat ~PaEv rpWTov K XEL KdKIS' iretra 5' 'j czvO%-' (!PXcoUEp yvvl X6 ywv TWTXov E (Vre 7crl ore aL  ppiva. pcdXL'ra dlV vpv ooo t r7~-8 ppOEV VaKd, Xr&amp;- U Kdo L" - TO.-Y&amp;p e'0 cTE6EiE eo01 OVoKorvraK o6 Xalpovo '" oo TOS Ye jci1v K aKO6 aZUoilO 7TK&amp;OOTLt KaCI 6[Otf I6XXvjev.

Similarly in the Electra the apparition of the Dios- curi produces, and is intended by Euripides to produce, a moral satis- faction and peacefulness, to which we are made to feel that the protagonists have succeeded in winning their way through ' life's fitful fever: " 6' ir ir6brov ILKEX6V o70rou6O cowovre very -rpq'pas dciXovus. 61&amp; 6' aiGeplas oTrdxo ve rXaKb69 ooi t LZvovaapo0 o06K 7rapctyo/eyv, otOWv 6' 6oa6 ao KlOb 7 KCV'O 4iXov ' fBrt6rp, roTrovE XaXewv OKX6~OVe0 lb6XOWV (yoPev. o0TrwS d&amp;KeW lP cS OeX'wSr O /A-1' 68lr6pKwA gzra avL7rXeirtW o06r y 0orqrods dyope6w.

So far, then, the p.aXavq would seem to have been used by Euripides (I) to produce a general aicdapo-? of the emotions such as is regarded by Aris- totle as the true object of tragedy; (2) to 'justify the ways of god to man,' as in the Hippolytus, Electra, and Andro- mache. Now look at Horace: Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus inciderit. These words are generally taken to mean that no god must intervene unless the complexities of the plot are such as to require his aid in order to solve them, i.e. vindice=solutore, as For- cellini definitely states, without, so far as I can see, any authority. No modern commentator discusses the interesting question of what are the conditions that justify divine inter- vention, though Orelli instances the Philoctetes of Sophocles and the Hip- polytus of Euripides. Porphyry alone insists upon the implication, and says 'tunc demum, inquit, inferri debet deus, cum digna res interventu eius exprimitur.' Horace clearly states that when the situation needs a 'vindex' a god may be brought in. Such is ex- actly the practice of Euripides, and it is only by ignoring the implication of the line, and giving an unwarranted meaning to 'vindex,' that the remark can be twisted, as it is, for example, by Wickham in his note on the passage, into a criticism of Euripides. There is no mention of Euripides in Horace, but he, unlike Aristotle, was a poet, and understood Euripides. Therefore, after saying 'nec deus intersit,' he adds-in order to exclude Euripides from the implied censure-' nisi dignus vindice nodus inciderit.' What sort of a nodus is worthy of a divine vindex we shall see from a further examination of the Euripidean use of the contrivance. Let us look again at the Heracles. When all seems to be going well, Lyssa and Iris appear adrr .l)Xavip, and Heracles, overcome by madness, him- self slays the wife and children whom he had just rescued from a similar fate at the hands of the upstart Lycus. What are we to make of such a sudden turn of events i': et';rv'la' el&amp; 8v-vXtav, as Aristotle says? We may take it that it is not sheer perversity on the poet's part, but is deliberately intended for some definite purpose. We notice first that Iris has to steel her heart to perform her commission - TElyKrov a-vXXapovo-a icapslav (830)-and is only nerved to do it because she perceives that, if she fails, the gods will be dis- credited and man exalted: O) eol uv o6atgoi, 7r  &amp;OvnrA 6' a-rat eyaiXa, i 6vbroS 6LKrvV. (841-2.) Lyssa is more outspoken, and openly questions the ways of god to man: rapawvoaL 66, irpiv o-aXe6oav e&amp;iOr-15v, "Hpt OXrw aoi r', ~)v riOOrl' 4tor X6byot. dvhip 66' oOiK &amp;arl7/o oC/r' 6rrl xOovl oT' Cv Oeo00 , o 0 L ' Cas6rt7rTE 86~oUov. alarov 66 X$pav Kat oiXaaav dypiav dCyEupdjaa, OeCjv davT7raev L6vot r7/r (~ rLT avooLwv dvapcgv 6ro aot r' o6 irapatvc^ /rsyXa po6Xea~at KaKci.

By the intervention of these ' instru- ments of darkness ' Euripides means to remind us that the problems of life are not so easily solved as we had been led to suspect by the happy turn of events up to the apparition of Lyssa and Iris. The traditional religion actually as- cribed malice to the gods, and Euripides uses this instance of the malice of Hera to witness to something in the divine power, which rules the universe, that passes our understanding, that won't fit into our moral or religious categories for the simple reason that they are not omniscient, but merely human, cate- gories. The ways of God are not man's ways. Whatever our religious opinions, we are all conscious that life, as we know it, is a drama played in the face of unknown, or, at least, but imperfectly comprehended, forces; it is surrounded on all sides by an uncharted fringe.' We thrust out our barque into it from time to time, but the conditions are such that no man-made boat can sail that sea; the wind may waft us mes- sages from it ever and anon, but they are diffused hither and thither before they reach us, for we can instal no ' wireless' there, so that we gather but fragments which, try as we will, we cannot piece into an intelligible whole. Then, sooner or later, death descends like a curtain, and we ourselves know no more. But when it descends upon our friends, we are left here to think and to meditate upon the hither side of the uncharted. We can see the pro- tagonists of the human drama brought right up to this 'fringe,' and the spectacle endows their lives with a solemnity which we feel, but cannot explain. What happens beyond cannot alter what they did in life, save that their passing from it seems to complete its significance, to endow it with an eternal value and, as it were, to make it immortal. Now the ordinary dramatis personae of a Euripidean tragedy are these protagonists in a drama of human life. The deus ex machina is not a human protagonist, but an incorporeal spirit of surmise, of hope or faith--in form a messenger from the uncharted, but in reality no more than a projection of our own, to which faith or hope alone is emboldened to give the sanction of a deus, of a messenger from some region beyond the scope of our ex- plored experience. Such, to my mind, is the meaning of the Horatian vindex. The above assumes, of course, that the apparition of a god ''ro rnxav?7 in the pages of Euripides involves no belief in anthropomorphism. The subject can- not be summarily treated, and I must reserve a fuller treatment of it for another occasion. Here it is sufficient to indicate that I cannot agree with Dr. Verrall, who argues that if Euripides used the 'machine ' seriously, then he believed in anthropomorphism. In his essay on the Iphigeneia in Tauris (Eurifides the Rationalist, pp. 174-5), he thinks it inconsistent to scoff at one who took Orestes and Pylades for the Dioscuri, and then to have a divine apparition of them later on in the same play. The argument, of course, holds good only on Dr. Verrall's interpreta- tion (the commonly accepted one) of Euripides' use of the pnxavl', and implies that there is no difference in the apparition of the Dioscuri on the earth, as anthropomorphic gods, and a*rrb tqXavq,. I contend that there is a very great difference. A seriously- intended representation of their appar- ition on the earth would imply a belief in anthropomorphism, but no such belief is involved in their apparition Arb ,nxaPrv. So we are by no means forced to conclude, with Dr. Verrall, that such apparitions cannot be in- tended to be taken seriously. To be taken literally, of course, they are not; but seriously is a very different matter. 1 Cf. Gilbert Murray in Four Stages of Greek Religion (p. 152): ' The uncharted surrounds us on every side, and we must needs have some relation towards it, a relation which will depend on the general discipline of a man's mind and the bias of his whole character. As far as knowledge and conscious reason will go, we shall follow resolutely their austere guidance. When they cease, as cease they must, we must use as best we can those fainter powers of apprehension and surmise and sensitiveness by which, after all, most high truth has been reached, as well as most high art and poetry.'</page><page sequence="5">14 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Some of the most serious things in life can scarcely be given a 'local habitation and a name,' though, for the purposes of scenic representation, some attempt must. be made, and this attempt Euripides makes in his ~jrXav'. I conclude by explaining what I meant by calling Aristotle's criticism of the ending of the Medea a misrepre- sentation. In the light of what has been said above, it will be clear that Euripides, in snatching up Medea in the chariot of the sun, had a motive different from that of saving her from the hands of Jason. In fact, it would have made no difference to the play had she been killed by Jason, for, as it is, by ascending in the chariot of the sun, she vanishes completely from the scene of human drama, and is caught up by the PtiLxav' into the sphere of the un- charted just as much as she would have been by death. In a modern novel on the same theme she would, no doubt, have been killed by Jason, and the reader left to ponder her wrongs. In the hands of Euripides she is allowed to point these out for herself,5 with all the sanction and finality that belongs to the 7Xaxav7. R. B.
