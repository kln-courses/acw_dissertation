(37.I x 2z.3 cm) Purchase, The Dillon Fund Gift, I989 I989.I4I.I The copying of sutras, the sacred texts of Buddhism and Taoism, required a special brush, paper of a standard size with a vertical grid, and the use of the strictest, most formal script-hsiao-k'ai, or "small regular"-written in columns of precisely seventeen characters. This hallowed fragment of the Taoist text Scripture of Transcendent Flight meets all those requirements, yet it has an elegance and fluency that elevate it beyond conventional fine sutra writing. The tall, rectangular structure of the characters, the perfection of each stroke, and ink tones that vary slightly as the characters descend the column-all these elements suggest familiarity with the newest developments among scholar-official callig- raphers of the eighth century. A particularly beautiful feature is the shaping of the right-descending stroke, which some- times swells to a rounded tip but more often tapers to a sharp point with a slightly concave profile. In short, the refinements reflect the calligrapher's training with master- works of the highest order. This sutra was owned by the Ming dynasty scholar-official Tung Ch'i-ch'ang (I555-1636), who was an influential painter, calligrapher, and theorist. He acquired the calligraphy as a handscroll in 6o08 and studied it as a model for his "small- Entries by James Watt, Senior Curator; Martin Lerner, Curator; Alfreda Murck, Associate Curator and Administrator; Barbara Ford, Associate Curator; Maxwell K.

Tung reluctantly lent the scroll to a "Mr. Ch'en" for inclusion in a set of rubbings of model calligraphies, the Po-hai Ts'ang-chen, but he held back twelve lines for safe- keeping. Tung was justified in his apprehension; his scroll was returned minus forty-three lines. Tung's scroll, including the twelve lines, has since disappeared, and the manuscript we celebrate today comprises the forty-three lines preserved by the unscrupulous Ch'en.

(32.1 X I7.8 cm) Purchase, The Dillon Fund Gift, 1989 1989.141.2 Calligraphy is the most highly revered of the visual arts in China. Rubbings were devised as a means of reproducing rare brush-written manuscripts; although the rubbing was several steps removed from the original, the transfer and carving of brushstrokes into stone was accomplished with such sensitivity that a reliable replica could be created. A precursor of printing, rubbings such as Eight Model Calligraphies made possible the dissemination of calligraphic styles through their multiple copies and also preserved likenesses of lost originals. A fine art in their own right, rubbings generated centuries of connoisseurship and study. Containing some of the oldest surviving rubbings, this re- nowned album, which is said to date to the Ch'ing-li reign (1041-48), preserves eight famous early calligraphies from the Eastern Chin (317-420), Liang (502-557), and T'ang (618-906) dynasties. The first four works-On Master Yiieh I (illustrated), Yellow Court Scripture, Memorial on the Filial Daughter Ts'ao 0, and Orchid Pavilion Preface-had almost legendary associations with the Chin master Wang Hsi-chih (303-379), regarded as the greatest of Chinese calligraphers. The fifth rubbing is another, seventh-century transcription of On Master Yiieh I. The remaining works preserve the styles of three T'ang masters: Liu Kung-ch'uan (778-865), Yii Shih-nan (558-638), and Ch'u Sui-liang (596-658). Over the centuries the album was treasured by many famous collectors including Hsiang Yiian-pien (5 z5- 1590) of the Ming dynasty, who records in a colophon that he bought it in 1577 for the considerable sum of eighty ounces of silver plus the bonus of a Han-dynasty bronze tripod.

(37.5 X 240.7 cm) Purchase, The Dillon Fund Gift, I989 I989.I41.3 Elegant Gathering in the Apricot Garden, painted by the court artist Hsieh Hiian, exemplifies the Ming revival of the meticulously descriptive style favored by the Sung imperial painting academy; in its use of vivid mineral colors and rich ink washes on silk, it is an early masterpiece of the Ming courtly tradition. The painting documents a remarkable garden party that took place in Peking on April 6, I437. The assembled guests included the three most powerful men in China at the time, Yang Jung (1371-1440), the party's host, and his close asso- ciates Yang Shih-ch'i (I365-1444) and Yang P'u (I372-1446). Known as the "Three Yang," these officials played a key role in consolidating Ming governmental power and establishing a golden age of stability and prosperity while serving as virtual regents to a child emperor who had ascended the throne in 1435. The three Grand Secretaries did not choose to be depicted in their administrative surroundings. The painting shows the "Three Yang" and their colleagues at leisure within a garden setting, enjoying a variety of scholarly pastimes. Hsieh Hiian's painting follows the convention of the literary gathering, but substitutes real people for ideal types. The elegant garden, lavishly furnished with antiques and schol- arly paraphernalia, attests to the participants' literary inter- ests and aesthetic discernment as well as their worldly power. In addition to presenting his patrons as scholar-gentlemen, Hsieh Huan has ordered his composition to reflect the rela- tive importance of the various guests. The most important dignitaries are formally arrayed in the center, while more casual groupings of arriving visitors and seated guests bal- ance one another to the right and left. Yang Shih-ch'i, the oldest man at the gathering, holds the place of honor in the center. He faces directly out in a pose that is more rigid than that of any of the other figures. He is, in fact, the pivot point or central axis of the hierarchy. To his left sits Wang Chih (I379-I462), a native of Yang Shih-ch'i's hometown, who was made a vice-minister of rites in I438. To his right is Yang Jung, the garden's owner and patron of the artist. As host, Yang Jung is properly deferential and sits to one side, but his red robe with a badge makes him the most prominent member of the trio. Yang P'u is the focus of the final cluster of figures, where he is shown admiring a painting. A year younger than Yang Jung, he became Grand Secretary only one year before this party, in 1436. Hsieh Hiian's painting is far from a literal record of what took place; instead, it presents a carefully constructed dia- gram of power politics and cultural values. Designed to fulfill the historiographic ambitions of his patrons, the paint- ing is a rare key to the mind-set and mores of the Ming cultural elite.

(25.4 x 3z.8 cm) Purchase, The Dillon Fund Gift, 1989 I989.I41.4 During the i66os and I670s Wang Hui produced the finest works of his career as he passionately explored the brush styles of various past masters. This album not only exemplifies Wang Hui's pursuit of a creative synthesis of old styles through the careful study and reinterpretation of ancient paintings, it also documents the close relationship between Wang Hui and his mentor, Wang Shih-min. The album provides striking evidence that Wang Hui, although forty years younger, had by this time so far surpassed Wang Shih-min that the teacher had begun to imitate the pupil's paintings. Wang Hui's album, done at Wang Shih-min's request, repre- sents a virtuoso performance in which he presents startling characterizations of familiar models: large-scale compositions have been condensed and reshaped, brush idioms have been transformed into small-scale brushstrokes of great liveliness, and vivid colors have been applied in striking combinations. Wang Shih-min was so impressed by Wang Hui's perfor- mance that he created his own set of album leaves based on those of his pupil. Only two of Wang Shih-min's leaves remain. His interpretation of Li Ch'eng (about 919-967) is closely modeled on Wang Hui's painting, but he was unable to duplicate the younger man's evocation of Chao Meng-fu's (1254-13z2) intricate "blue-and-green" style (above). Instead, Wang Shih-min substituted his version of Chao Meng-fu's sketchy landscape manner (below).

(zi.5 x i6.7 cm) Purchase, The Dillon Fund Gift, 1989 1989.142 These twelve diminutive landscapes by Tai Pen-hsiao are among the finest examples of his extant oeuvre. Having witnessed the violent Manchu conquest in I644, Tai became a passionate Ming loyalist who turned to painting to sup- port his impoverished family. His painting was based on the idealism of literati reclusion, an elitist style that, as James Cahill has noted, paradoxically became widely popular in the seventeenth century. Tai's distinctive personal style fea- tures dry, airy brushwork and forms that teeter between substance and intangibility. Tai shared the late seventeenth-century confidence that art- ists could create without being constricted by the past. Thus when he cited sources from antiquity, he was acknowledging a spiritual as much as a stylistic debt-demonstrating origi- nality in spite of inherited tradition. For example, on leaf K (illustrated) Tai comments upon the desolate, chilly scene inspired by the Yuan dynasty master Ni Tsan (130I-1374), who was famous for his sparse, dry ink landscapes: "Ni Tsan's [style] is entirely too lonely. I intentionally elaborated on it. One need not adhere to only one master's method." Acknowledging that painting is after all an image concocted in the mind, he concludes the album with a snowscape to which he appends the following poem: Pure, bracing atmosphere-suddenly still, A thousand pines make shadows in the snow; I clean the inkstone not only for painting But also to reveal the images in my mind.

(68.7 x 1993 cm) Purchase, The Dillon Fund Gift, I988 I988.350 This monumental handscroll, over sixty-five feet in length, illustrates the triumphal entry of the Ch'ien-lung emperor (r. 1736-95) into Soochow, the Chinese cultural capital. It is one of a set of twelve scrolls that records the southern inspection tour. Both Ch'ien-lung and his grandfather the K'ang-hsi emperor (r. 1662-1722) made tours of the south and commissioned sets of handscrolls to commemorate their epic journeys. The Museum already owns one scroll from each of these sets: Scroll Three from the K'ang-hsi set (1979.5) depicts the emperor's visit to Mount T'ai, the sacred eastern peak; Scroll Four from the Ch'ien-lung series (I984.I6) depicts the emperor's inspection of conservation work along the Yellow River. Both scrolls feature the imposing landscape scenery of northern China. The present handscroll complements these images with a vivid evocation of the bustling urban life of the south. Longer than any other scroll in the Ch'ien-lung series, it is rich in narrative, making it unquestionably the most important scroll in the set. The artist, the court painter Hsii Yang, was a native of Soochow, and he depicted his hometown in loving detail. The painting not only records the lavish pageantry of the emperor's arrival but also provides an encyclopedic catalogue of daily life in eighteenth-century China, complete with mi- nutely observed descriptions of shops, residences, and in- habitants as well as Soochow's famous temples, government offices, and gardens. The painting also reveals the impact of Western art on court taste: Hsii Yang visualized the city as a single, unified panorama and employed Western-style per- spective and foreshortening in the rendering of architectural details. In his depiction of Ch'ien-lung, for example, Hsu Yang follows the European convention of presenting the principal figure in front of a deep perspective; he places the emperor along the diagonal line formed by the only deep recession in the entire scroll. According to the palace archives, Hsii Yang began work on the Southern Inspection Tour in 1764. He first made a draft on paper and then completed the finished silk version in time for the emperor's sixtieth birthday in 1770.

(41.3 cm) Purchase, Harris Brisbane Dick Fund and Mary Griggs Burke Gift, I989 I989.I7 A beautiful and unusual example of the earliest type of Japanese export lacquer, this cabinet with a fall front similar to that of the European vargueno, or drop-front desk, was made for the Spanish and Portuguese trade in the last quar- ter of the sixteenth century. Its form and decorative tech- nique are typical of Japanese lacquered cabinets found recently in increasing numbers in European collections, but its quality and ornament of figures and floral motifs reminis- cent of classical poetry and romantic literature set this piece above the others. It adds a fascinating aspect to the small but important group of Momoyama-period objects prominently displayed in the Japanese galleries. The rectangular cabinet, decorated with mother-of-pearl, painted gold lacquer, and sprinkled-gold lacquer, is divided into eleven interior sections: ten drawers surrounding a cen- tral, locked compartment embellished with an architectural framework of classical columns beneath an arch. On the outside of the front panel, which falls forward from hinges at the lower edge, is a scene of courtiers in a landscape dominated by maples and flowering trees. This lovely scene, unique among such cabinets, is bordered by three bands of geometric patterns characteristic of this early Japanese export lacquer. The interior surface of the front panel is covered with scrolling vines, as is the back of the cabinet. The drawers are fully lacquered, with front surfaces densely ornamented with varied floral motifs within borders of painted scrollwork. The top and sides of the cabinet are similarly decorated, and particular attention has been given to the fine execution of the top, which is richly inlaid with a scene of birds in a wisteria-laden pine, a motif that also recalls the court poetry of Japan. The taste for the exotic that marked the brief period of international influence in Japan, from about I570 to 1630, is exemplified in this cabinet. Its ornament reflects the fertile melange of artistic sources that gave birth to the exuberant expression of the Momoyama age. Made for the European market by Kyoto craftsmen, this cabinet, in the namban, or European, style, is marked by a horror vacui alien to tradi- tional Japanese design. It employs for its lively and gorgeous effect a combination of Japanese maki-e, sprinkled gold on lacquer with mother-of-pearl inlay, and bands of geometric decor, a reflection of a rich variety of influences characteris- tic of the period, when traders worked a far-reaching net- work from Spain to India and Southeast Asia, to the eastern regions of Korea, the Ryukyu Islands, and to southern China. This cabinet, like many similar examples used as curio cabi- nets or writing desks, was at one time fitted with a table stand made in Europe.

(88.9 cm) Anonymous Gift, in honor of Martin Lerner, 1988 I988.354 Yakshas, and their female counterparts, yakshis, are an ancient, complex category of Indian demigods who, in their earliest manifestation, seem to have been nature spirits. Among their many roles, they eventually evolved into minor divini- ties entrusted with the protection of the bounties of both nature and man. Important cults devoted to specific named yakshas existed at least as early as the second century B.C., and among the earliest surviving major stone anthropomor- phic sculptures of India, the most significant group, dated to the third and second centuries B.C., consists of yakshas and yakshis. Yakshas can be depicted with normal proportions or, as here, in a dwarflike form. The closest parallels for this sculpture are at Sanchi in the Vidisha District of Madhya Pradesh, near Bhopal in central India. The stupas at Sanchi are one of the glories of ancient Indian art. On the west torana, or gateway, of Stupa i, four addorsed potbellied dwarfs serve as capitals on the two pillars supporting the elaborately carved architraves. These yakshas come closest in style to the sculpture illustrated. Even at so early a date, the Indian genius for carving stone and infusing the creations with life is clearly evident. The great volumes are arranged with obvious confidence, and the bold forms are well defined and very skillfully integrated into a totality pulsating with energy. In profile the thrust of the large masses is so vigorous that the yaksha commands more visual space than one would anticipate. The figure wears a torque, a headband, and a short dhoti secured by a thick sash knotted in front. The cloth is of sufficient heaviness to develop a massive series of folds where it accumulates at the left hip. The arms of this yaksha were raised to support something, and he is carved in the round. This figure may have served as a capital for a torana, fulfilling the same purpose as the addorsed yakshas at Sanchi, or, like the famous earlier yaksha from Pitalkhora now in the National Museum, New Delhi, with which it has obvious stylistic connections, it may have supported a bowl on top of the head. Our yaksha is from a classification known as bharavahaka yakshas, or "carrier" yakshas. It is a sculpture of considerable presence and a most remarkable addition to our collections.

(30.2 cm) Gift of The Kronos Collections, 1988 I988.395 This three-piece gold diadem is an important addition to the literature on Indian jewelry. Nothing similar to it, so far as I am aware, has been reported. The diadem is of gold repousse. Nineteen pendants are attached to its lower edge, five to each side, and nine to the central panel-the longer pendant in the center ends in a leaf-shaped form, the others in smaller concave disks. The curves on the top edge of the diadem are surmounted by rounded budlike forms, five on each panel. Both the pendants and the buds are reminiscent of gold jewelry from the ancient Gandhara region. At the top outer edges of the central panel are two crescents encir- cling disks, a motif referring to the moon and sun that is frequently encountered in Kashmiri sculpture, either on the tops of mandorlas or as finials on stupas. This device also appears on the shoulders of crowned and jeweled Buddhas. The four kinnaris dominate the design. There are two of these half-avian, half-female celestial creatures flanking the garnet in the center and another on each side panel, their birds' tails abstracted into complex scrolling forms. Each of the kinnaris holds a thin jeweled chain, and the pair on the central panel also hold between them what seems to be a crown. The garnet is a sumptuous but discreet embellishment. Although this diadem could have been made farther west in northern Pakistan, Kashmir provides the strongest parallels. The style of the human portion of the kinnaris is similar to that of Kashmiri depictions, and the hairdo is a Kashmiri continuation of a type seen often on Gupta-period sculp- tures. Kinnaris rank rather low in importance for deities and are normally found in a minor context on the decoration of temples. The avian half of the kinnaris perched on the broken pediments of the eighth-century temple of Martand, in Kashmir, is treated in a somewhat naturalistic fashion. We come closer to the kinnaris on the diadem at the ninth- century temple of Avantisvamin at Avantipur, where there are kinnaris holding garlands and, on the lower frieze of an interior facade, a kinnari with a fancifully scrolling tail that is the nearest Kashmiri parallel known to me. The style and iconography of the diadem raise some interesting questions. The ubiquitous crowns, diadems, and tiaras of the art of Kashmir are almost always high and tripartite or triple-lobed. I know of no others shaped like this one, nor am I aware of any others decorated with kinnaris. In the corpus of known Kashmiri sculpture, therefore, this diadem may be unique. Although it is impossible to insist that this diadem was created in Kashmir-at least one common Kashmiri motif, rosettes above the ears, is missing-the diadem clearly be- longs within the Kashmiri stylistic orbit. It could date to as early as the second half of the ninth century, but a conserva- tive dating to the tenth century is probably accurate.

(28.4 cm) Purchase, Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust Gift, I988 I988.282 This bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, the embodiment of divine compassion, is identified by the small image of the Buddha Amitabha placed before the front lobe of his tiara. He stands in a hip-shot posture on a lotus pedestal, with his body in a pronounced tribhanga stance, and wears a patterned dhoti, which is tied asymmetrically with a long pleat of fabric falling between the legs. A scarf falls diagonally from the right hip and is tied behind the left thigh, with the ends streaming down the side. The figure is otherwise unadorned with the exception of a suite of elaborate jewelry-bangles, arm bands, necklace, earrings, a tall, three-lobed tiara, and a Brahmanic cord, worn draped across the body. An ovoid flaming nimbus encircles the sculpture's head. The bodhi- sattva would have held in his left hand a separately cast lotus flower, whose stem probably would have originated from the small foliate device on the lotus pedestal. His right hand is raised, palm outward, in varadamudra, the gesture denoting the fulfillment of wishes. Much of the original gilding remains intact. This sculpture fills a significant gap in our unrivaled collec- tion of early Nepalese bronzes, which illustrates a continuous sequence of sculptural styles from the seventh through the fifteenth century. The conservative Nepalese sculptural style derived from northern Indian traditions, particularly from those of the Gupta period, as practiced at Sarnath, and the later Pala-Sena periods in eastern India. While the plastic conception of the figures remained relatively constant over the centuries, small changes in the subsidiary elements- jewelry, costumes, pedestals, and halos-allow images to be dated. This figure may have been part of a trinity and placed to the left of a seated Buddha, with a standing image of Maitreya, the future Buddha, positioned to the right.

(15z2.5 cm) Purchase, Friends of Asian Art, Mr. and Mrs. Donald Bruckmann, Mr. and Mrs. Perry J. Lewis, and Anonymous Gifts, I988 I988.I60 Representations of the triumph of good over evil are not un- common in Hindu art, and one of the most persistent is the great goddess Durga killing the buffalo demon (Mahishasura). This mythological event is celebrated in Indian art through- out the subcontinent, and the theme was transmitted to Southeast Asia as well, appearing in Indonesian art and in the early sculpture of Thailand and Cambodia. After the gods were defeated by the lord of the demons, Durga was created out of their collective energies to defend the universe. Having been given the weapons of each of the gods and possessing all of their powers, she defeats first the demon's armies and then Mahishasura himself. The elaborate stories recounting these events are preserved primarily in the Markandeya Purana. Based on the number of surviving sculptures of Durga from Java, cults devoted to the goddess seemed to have been pop- ular from about the beginning of the eighth century through the fourteenth century. The multiarmed Durga is usually depicted, as here, standing victorious on the back of the recumbent buffalo demon, and lifting his tail. A war discus (chakra) projects from the buffalo's severed neck; emerging from the fatal wound, the demon, now in anthropomorphic form, clasps his hands together in adoration of Durga. This unusually large sculpture, even with the loss of the heads of Durga and the demon and the partial restoration of the goddess's breasts, is one of the most imposing examples known. The goddess's ample and powerful body is well modeled, and the drapery folds, jewelry, and sashes are carved with meticulous precision. This sculpture strongly complements our unparalleled holdings of small Javanese bronze sculptures.

(39.I cm) Gift of Mrs. Enid Haupt, 1988 I988.393 Worship of the linga in India goes back to remote antiquity. In Indian sculpture and that of countries influenced by Hindu theology, including Cambodia, adoration of the linga is understood to be worship of the great Generative Principle of the Universe conceptualized as an aspect of Shiva; but there is, in addition, a rich, multilayered system of meanings associated with interpretations of the significance of the linga, the most sacrosanct icon of a Shivite temple and housed in the innermost sanctuary. The basic phallic shape is obvious and can be plain, as here, or carved with one to five faces. The lower part of the shaft, here faceted into eight sections, is set into a stone pedestal, theoretically corresponding to the female genitalia. The octagonal portion of the linga is a reference to Vishnu as Preserver of the Universe and is sunk deep into the pedestal, while farther down, albeit invisible, the octagonal shaft be- comes square, signifying the third member of the Hindu triad, Brahma the Creator.The projecting spout allows for the runoff of the sacred liquid used as part of the ritual. The relationship of the small linga to the large architectonic pedestal suggests a linga on top of a monument. It is known that some of the Khmer rulers of Cambodia had a linga, part of the royal paraphernalia, placed at the summit of their most important temple. This example was found with a very fine image of a kneeling male deity, almost certainly a representation of Shiva in his aspect of Divine Teacher and Great Ascetic or of Shiva's manifestation, the sage Agastya. This is the first Southeast Asian linga to enter the collection.

(105.5 cm) Partial Gift of The Honorable Walter Annenberg, 1988 I988.355 This surprisingly large gilded-bronze sculpture sums up not only the essence and spirit of royal classical Cambodian sculpture but of a whole great civilization. The figure is of such superb quality and possesses such magnetic grandeur that it must be considered one of the most important examples of the arts of Asia and certainly the most important gift of a Southeast Asian sculpture ever made to our collection. The sculpture dates to the second half of the eleventh century and is in the Baphuon style (about ioio-about IIIo). The name of the style, as with all Cambodian styles, is taken from a monument-in this case the very large step-pyramid temple, Baphuon, constructed at Angkor about 1050-66, during the reign of Udayadityavarman II. The concept of divine kingship was central to Khmer author- ity and government, and the cult of the Devaraja, the God- king, was the state religion. The ruler was not only the temporal head of state but, through his association with a specific deity, was God's representative on earth. It has been suggested that with each new ruler a statue was created and placed in that ruler's main temple, providing the same reli- gious and symbolic significance as icons of the deities. How- ever, not a single sculpture can be identified today as one that embodied the legitimacy of the reign-the Devaraja statue. The hand gestures and the crown (incomplete) on this sculp- ture are to my knowledge unique, making it unlikely that this figure represents any of the known Cambodian deities. Rather, it may depict a deified ruler, as is suggested by the size, quality, and medium. If this is the case, the figure may commemorate a past ruler or, more likely, be the only known surviving Devaraja image, perhaps associated with Jayavarman vi, whose accession took place in o080. The sculp- tor would probably have been the most accomplished of the period, perhaps selected by the royal priest Divakarapandita, who presided over the coronation of Jayavarman vi. I know of no other sculpture that can be attributed to the same hand. To judge from the few surviving Baphuon-style male deities in bronze, two separate traditions of arranging the garment (sampot) existed-in stone and in bronze. The "pocket" pleats on the left thigh of almost every stone Baphuon male deity do not appear on the bronzes, and the pendant sash- ends between the thighs (a carryover from the earlier Kleang style) is absent from Baphuon stone sculptures. Instead, in stone the sash is knotted in a different manner, with its ends hanging down the right thigh. To my knowledge, these two methods of arranging the sampot are unvaryingly consistent for each medium. To appreciate the potential for sculptures in bronze, but impractical in stone, one need only look at the separately cast extravagant "butterfly" bow projecting so prominently at the back of the sampot worn by our Deified King. This large element, with an exuberant sculptural life of its own, exhibits the specific technical and aesthetic concerns of bronze casting and would be unthinkable in stone. The condition of this image, the largest complete Cambo- dian bronze sculpture known, is unparalleled. The fingers, the bow in back, the pendant sash-ends in front, and a good deal of the original gilding are intact. Only the top of the crown, the outer perimeter of the ear pendants-originally probably of some semiprecious material-and the inlays of the eyebrows, mustache, beard, and pupils have not survived. The putative Devaraja image of Jayavarman vi radiates an austere authority befitting a Khmer ruler. It is more than just a great work of art, it is a highly complex historical, social, and religious icon-a potent Cambodian expression of "God on Earth."

(44.5 cm) Signed: Not Purchase, Friends of Asian Art Gifts, I989 I989.143 The use of cobalt blue for underglaze decoration on porce- lain began in Vietnam during the fourteenth century, about the same time as its inception in China. Blue-and-white porcelain, whether Chinese or Vietnamese, was considered a commodity, intended principally for the overseas market, in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, rather than for a do- mestic one. The forms and decoration of early Vietnamese blue and white closely followed contemporary Chinese mod- els, from which evolved an international style in trade ceramics. However, there were distinctive traits in the deco- ration of Vietnamese ceramics. During the fifteenth century one of the distinguishing characteristics of Vietnamese blue and white was the use of pencil lines that served both as shading and as a means of depicting the leaf veins and petals of plant motifs. This technique is well demonstrated in the dish recently acquired by the Museum. Vietnamese porcelain of this period can also be identified by the finely levigated clay body and the slightly uneven flow of its warm white glaze. Given that most blue-and-white porcelain was exported, it is not surprising that some of the best surviving Vietnamese pieces are to be found outside the country. One of the most well-known examples is in the Topkapi Sarayi Museum, Istanbul: It is a vase decorated with peony scrolls that is dated by the underglaze blue inscription to I450 (the eighth year of Ta Ho). The vase also bears the name of the artist who painted it. The Museum's dish is decorated in the same style with the same peony flowers and scrolls and also bears the signature of the artist, but not the date. A careful com- parison of the style and execution of the decoration of the two pieces results in the conclusion that the Museum's dish is later, dating perhaps to the late fifteenth century. jw 93</page><page sequence="16">Standing Thousand-Armed Chenresi (A Cosmic Form of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara) Tibetan, i4th century Ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on cloth 283/4 X 24 in. (73 x 61 cm) Purchase, Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust Gift, 1989 I989.I8 This Tibetan thanka with its beautiful drawing and color- ation forms a bridge between the earliest Tibetan painting in the Museum's collection, The Portrait of a Great Teacher Surrounded by Lamas and Mahasiddhas (about I300), and the collection's mandalas of the Nor School (fifteenth cen- tury). The late thirteenth through the fourteenth century was the formative period for much of the iconography that would dominate later Tibetan art, and paintings of this period are particularly rare. This thanka is most closely related to the murals at Shalu Monastery, which were probably painted in the second quarter of the thirteenth century, perhaps by Nepalese artists. Both share a common physiognometric type as well as many similar stylistic traits. This painting is the earliest known depiction of the Buddhist deity Chenresi. Its Nepalese style and Tibetan iconography represent an important link between earlier Tibetan painting traditions and the later purely Tibetan-style ones of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Chenresi is a cosmic form of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, the manifestation of Divine Compassion. He has ten heads and is portrayed surrounded by his thousand arms, which form a golden aureole, patterned by the red of his painted palms, around his upper body. His principal hands are held up before his chest in anjalimudra, the hand position denot- ing adoration, while other hands hold attributes-a lotus, water pot, wheel, and rosary. The majority of the hands are empty and display at their centers the horizontal eye that is another of his attributes. These multiple features are the visualized embodiment of the deity's potential for emanating his message to all sentient beings in every quarter of the universe. Chenresi stands at the center of the thanka on a lotus base; he is surrounded by a dark blue field, scattered with flowers and small red-backed niches that enclose auxiliary figures of lamas and deities. A border of these niches frames the entire perimeter of the thanka. In the lower left corner a monk is shown seated before an offering table. The lamas surrounding the central deity probably represent historical or quasi-historical figures and were once identified by in- scriptions, which have been abraded and are illegible. There are two inscriptions on the back of the painting; one is a common dedicatory formula and the other a quote from the Buddha that suggests patience as the most holy of ascetic practices.
