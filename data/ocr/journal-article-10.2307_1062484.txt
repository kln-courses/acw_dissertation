REYNOLDS and THEODORE M. LUDWIG. Studies in the History of Religions (Supplements to NVMEN), 39. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1980. Pp. vi + 285. This collection of essays honors Joseph M. Kitagawa, but it does so in a manner different from that of the traditional festschrift. The editors have tried to reflect the special style of religiohistorical work which Kitagawa has pro- moted. Therefore, they have included only contributions from younger his- torians of religions who studied under Kitagawa and who reflect the scope of his interests in their own work. As the editors remark in their introduction, the method of investigation represented in the volume presumes that there is a specifically religious dimen- sion to human existence and seeks the meaning of religious phenomena. Thus, the contributors are convinced that it is possible to loosen in creative fashion the sharp dichotomy between objective and subjective knowledge. They ac- knowledge the value of different descriptive, functionalist, and structuralist methods, but they also see value in theological interpretations that help religion acquire a responsible mode of expression in the modern world. Their goal of an "integral understanding" of religious experience seems to the contributors to require a constant movement in methodology back and forth between ? 1984 by The University of Chicago.

But because it is subjective, this empathy is open to dispute, even if it is exercised in a disciplined way. A second characteristic of the volume's approach is that the authors begin empirically with the historical givens of specific religious traditions. Each of these religions is further presumed to have its own kind of inner consistency, which the historian of religions must identify and describe in order to under- stand each religion from its particular center of meaning. This sort of under- standing, in turn, allows the historian of religions to see the history of each religious tradition in the larger context of the general history of religions. The authors derive yet a third characteristic of their approach from Kita- gawa, their concern to interpret religion in relation to other aspects of human life. In their view history of religions relates closely to other disciplines of the human sciences. Ultimately, this concern results in another, the concern for scholarly integrity that the authors also inherit from Kitagawa. It seems especially appropriate for the volume to emphasize transitions and transformations in the history of religions. They have been a central and far-reaching theme in Kitagawa's own work. Accordingly, the authors direct their attention to the meaning of religious change as an important dimension of religious experience and to understanding religious change as a living process in which religion is transmitted in interaction with other dimensions of human culture and society. The desire to understand the meaning of religious experience sets for the historian of religions the task of interpreting the meaning of religious traditio or trans-formation. Here we see how Kitagawa has developed further the method Wach used in his attempt to mediate between systematic and historical approaches to the study of religions. The individual essays treat different periods, from the seventh century B.C. to the present, in five traditions: Judaism, Theravada Buddhism, Islam, China, and Japan. They are classified on historical and comparative-cultural grounds. The scholarly apparatus has been deliberately kept to a minimum. Specialists with questions are encouraged to contact individual authors for more detailed comments. The theme of the first part of the volume is "Religion and the Transforma- tion of National Traditions." The essay by Theodore M. Ludwig, "Remember Not the Former Things" (Isa. 43:18), develops the thesis that in the time of the Babylonian exile religious change came about quickly when the saving power of the traditional religious reality was experienced as insufficient under new circumstances. Tension between authoritative tradition and new experience made the prophetic transformation possible. Ludwig understands the "pro- phetic transformation" as a reenactment of sacred history, in which the radicalized paradigm of salvation-in the form of a universalization of the Exodus tradition-provided the grammar for understanding and interpreting the activity of the God of the covenant in the events of the present. The essay composed by coeditor Frank E. Reynolds together with Regina T. Clifford discusses the modern transformation of the social order of Theravada Buddhism in Burma and Thailand (pp. 56-88). The authors begin with the Buddhist theory of action (the law of the consequences of action [kamma] and its ideal order [dhamma]) and the social expression of the Theravada ideal (the 175</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews fundamental relation between laity and monks). They explain the modern problem of national integration in terms of the disruption of the comple- mentary opposition between the monastic order and the laity, which had found its most stable expression on the village level. They contrast the manner in which the traditional order was violated in Burma with the manner in which it was not violated but transformed in Thailand. In both cases, however, the changed relations between monks and laity resulted in an increasing hierarchi- zation of the sangha. After Burmese independence, the sangha became a force for the revival of traditional values, and in Thailand it became a factor promoting national integration. The second part of the volume discusses transitions and transformations in Islam. Frederick M. Denny's essay (pp. 91-123) traces a dialectic of transfor- mations and continuity in the development of the exegesis and recitation of the Qur'an as a classical form of Islamic piety (pp. 99-123). The transformative nature of exegesis stands in tension with the traditional piety of ritual recita- tion that supports it. Before recitation and exegesis became sciences, they were bound together as practices, even as early as the time of Muhammad. Denny succeeds in showing that the dimension of recitation, which has been relatively neglected in Western investigations, was equal in importance to exegesis. In the second essay of this part, Earle H. Waugh discusses the role of the Imam as leader of the Islamic community in the very new and different environment of Canada (pp. 124-49). This figure displays well a conscious interaction between inherited models and new demands and experiences. He must seek to do justice both to the expectations of traditionally minded, newly arrived immigrants from Islamic lands and, at the same time, to the expecta- tions of those who have been living in Canada for a relatively long time. He must also take into account the value of the new environment for the way an increasing number of Muslims live. In addition to filling traditional roles and serving as the protector of the ancestral tradition for the majority of the community, he must also assume roles played by representatives of other Canadian religious communities. The volume's third part treats transitions and transformations in Chinese religion. David L. Overmyer's essay depicts the way in which, over a long period of time, popular interpretations have altered the monistic cosmology of the elite in China in a dualistic direction (pp. 153-84). The author demon- strates in an interesting manner how transformations in religious meaning occur not only over time but also between different levels of understanding and expression in a single cultural system, for example, between the elitist philos- ophy with its abstractly conceived, interacting forms of energy (yin and yang) and the popular myth and ritual that personify these powers and assign dramatic roles to them. At the same time, the author points out transitions between the two levels that attest very clearly to their intimate connection. The contribution by Paul V. Martinson discusses the modern transforma- tion of the Confucian concern with harmonizing cosmological and social duali- ties into the Maoist emphasis on the necessity of opposition and struggle for the creation of a protecting and even of a saving community (pp. 185-218). First the author discusses a classical Confucian passage from the eleventh 176</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions century as an example of the principles of reciprocity, by which the whole world is understood in analogy to the family. Then he turns to a transitional form in the work of K'ang Yu-wei (ca. 1900), which abolishes all national, familial, and sexual boundaries and takes reciprocity as a basis only in a universalized form. Finally he considers the transformation wrought by Mao, who makes contradiction rather than reciprocity the fundamental principle. The fourth part of the volume depicts transitions and transformations in ancient, medieval, and modern Japanese religion. The essay by Manabu Waida (pp. 221-41) discusses the interaction between Buddhism and the Japanese kingship ideology during the fifth to the tenth centuries (pp. 221-41). Waida attempts to show that, from the oldest time to the present, Japanese religion has preserved specific principles and that Buddhism, by its contact with the Japanese experience, has undergone remarkable changes that correspond to the strong emphasis on the concrete world of human existence characteristic of Japanese thought. With Kitagawa, the author conceives of Japanese religion as cosmic religion. He understands its history as a dynamic process of reinterpre- tation, and he emphasizes the strong relation between the natural and the social world, which may be seen, for example, in the kingship festival at the New Year's celebration. The next essay, by William R. LaFleur, interprets the interaction of Bud- dhism and the Japanese shamanistic tradition from the seventh to the seven- teenth century (pp. 242-60). LaFleur shows how the great poet Basho con- sciously used general reminiscences of earlier visionary forms to express his own vision. At the same time, he makes clear how closely the aesthetic and the religious experiences were combined in Japan and how the lasting value of every religious experience was acknowledged, even when something new appeared. To understand Japanese culture, LaFleur refers to Kitagawa's espe- cially valuable contention that it was traditional in Japan to refuse to bifurcate things, even though the possibility of bifurcation was seen and acknowledged. Thus, LaFleur sees the coexistence of Buddhism and Shinto as a conceptual necessity, not as a compromise. The fourth, and final, part of the volume concludes with observations by Winston Davis on the character and extent of the "secularization" of religion in modern Japan. Davis contends that there is no single measure that can be applied to every process of secularization, however that process may be under- stood. His thesis is that secularization is ultimately impossible in Japan because in Japan the sacred and the profane coincide. In line with this thesis, he characterizes Japanese culture as a "logic of relative contrasts." By doing so, he is able to explain the otherwise incomprehensible overlapping of deliberate skepticism and religious behavior, including the phenomenal growth of the "new religions" in Japan, as well as the increase in magical beliefs. The contributions give a very good impression of Kitagawa's effectiveness as a teacher. In fact, his teaching activity could not be illustrated better. The extensive bibliography, on the other hand, begins to make us aware of Kita- gawa's activity as a scholar. It makes apparent much more than his erudition, his universality, and his originality. For Kitagawa has served numerous col- leagues and pupils as an editor, as a translator, and as a contributor to various collections. On several occasions he has devoted to completing the work of 177</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews another scholar the effort one would normally give to an entire project of one's own. The list of this kind of work, which also includes essays written in Japanese, is especially impressive. Finally, Kitagawa has spent a great deal of time working on various committees, which in their own way serve scholar- ship. Especially important are the more than ten years during which he served as dean of the Divinity School of the University of Chicago. It makes a great deal of sense that such a festschrift as this was compiled not in honor of a birthday but at the end of Kitagawa's term as dean. To the congratulations of the volume's editors and contributors, I add my own heartfelt congratulations, and I wish Joseph Kitagawa many more years in which to continue the work that has been so important to us all. CARSTEN COLPE Free University of Berlin GOD IN ANCIENT EGYPT Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt: The One and the Many. By ERIK HORNUNG. Translated by JOHN BAINES. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1982. Pp. 296. Erik Hornung's penetrating analysis of the Egyptian conception of god might even convince one that a polytheistic religion deserves to be called a great religion. Adopting a relativistic position, he avoids forcing Egyptian religion into a grand evolutionary scheme in the history of religion, and his study provides caveats to some of the generalists' models. Egyptian religion does not neatly fit some of the hypothesized developmental frameworks, such as the assumed gradual ascendancy of local gods via political processes and territorial accretion to the status of universal deities. Hornung presents some evidence for just the reverse process: the secondary localization of universal deities. One is also warned against making simple equations of cosmic gods with natural elements. While Hornung believes that it is impossible to assert the priority of fetishism over zoolatry, he does regard anthropomorphism as a later development, even though this assumes that the earliest Egyptians made a sharper generic distinction between animals and humans than is perhaps war- ranted and reflects Rudolf Otto's dated view of the numinous otherness of animals. With the exception of the Amarna period, Hornung denies the presence of monotheistic features in Egyptian religion and speaks rather in terms of henotheism, whereby a worshiper singles out some divinity on whom he focuses his attention and to whom he ascribes the highest attributes, without denying the existence of the pantheon. Only Akhenaten's short-lived religious reform, admirably treated by Hornung, witnessed a radical digression in which the multiplicity of deities was abandoned in favor of a sole deity, whose nature was articulated through the uniquely rational logic of the heretic pharaoh. 178</page></plain_text>
