<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPEECH OF PYTHAGORAS IN METAMORPHOSES I5 AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE METAMORPHOSES The last book in Ovid's universal history of transformation has a special interest for analysts of the structure of the Metamorphoses. If the Metamor- phoses is a unity, it is here that the unity should be clinched. Bk. i5 should bear an unmistakable consequential relationship to the preceding fourteen books. It contains 879 lines, and slightly less than half of these, 4I9 lines (60-478) are devoted to the teachings of Pythagoras. This is by far the longest single episode in Bk. I5, and one of the longest in the Metamorphoses. If Bk. I5 does in fact have an important part in the overall structure of the poem, so obviously does the exposition of Pythagoreanism, and an examination of its precise relationship to the main body of the work should help us to determine its importance as a structural element, and throw some light on the general question of the unity and structure of the Metamorphoses as a whole. The direct connection between the Pythagoras episode and the thread of Ovid's narrative at this point is not close. Ovid's select history of early Rome has brought him, at the end of Bk. I4, to the apotheosis of Romulus. Bk. I5 begins with the appointment of Romulus' successor. The new king was Numa, a man of restless intellectual curiosity, particularly in the field of natural philosophy: non ille satis cognosse Sabinae gentis habet ritus: animo maiora capaci concipit et, quae sit rerum natura, requirit. (3-5) To satisfy his thirst for knowledge, Numa left Cures and went to Croton (6-7). The first thing he learned there was the foundation myth of the city. It owed its origin to Hercules, apparently, who had appeared in a dream to Myscelus, an otherwise obscure Greek, and instructed him to seek the ))rockstrewn waters of the Aesar# (lapidosas Aesaris undas, 22). Failure to comply would entail dire retribution (multa ac metuenda, 24). By local law, however, emigration was punishable by death, and Myscelus, faced with irreconcilable alternatives of the kind dear to the heart of rhetoricians' deferred his decision. Hercules reappeared, and threatened retribution direr still (plura et graviora, 33). The reluctant emigrant attempted to leave the city, was caught and tried, and acquitted only after Hercules had tampered with the due process of law by turning the black condemnatory tokens white in the voting-urn. A free man, Myscelus sailed to Italy and founded Croton. Ovid concludes: 1 Cf. for example Seneca Controv. I, 5-the case of a man who raped two women in one night. One of his victims demanded his death, the other marriage.</page><page sequence="2">The Speech of Pythagoras in Metamorphoses I5 and the Structure of the Metamorphoses 34I talia constabat certa primordia fama esse loci jositaeque Italis in finibus urbis (58-9). It is clear that the connection between this myth and Numa is minimal. His question was the justification for its being told, that is all. Since line io he hasn't been referred to, and Ovid doesn't refer to him again at line 6o, when he has finished the foundation-myth of Croton. Instead, he plunges straight into what is, for all the relevance it has to Numa or Croton, a philosophical digression of 420 lines in which he claims to expound the doctrines of Pythag- oras. It is only at the end of these 420 lines, at line 479, that Ovid tells us, in most perfunctory fashion- talibus atque aliis instructum pectora dictis in patriam remeasse ferunt ... ... Numam (479-8I)- and in flagrant contradiction of well-known historical fact', that Numa also had profited from Pythagoras' teaching, and in this way tries to reattach the digression to the main narrative. Yet despite this ramshackle attachment of the part to the whole, the Pythagoras digression has traditionally been felt to be an intrinsic, in fact a vital part of the overall structure of the Metamorphoses. It may be only one of the methods by which Ovid aims to achieve unity, but it is an important one. Thus Otto KORN writes, )&gt;In dieser Rede (sc. Pythagoras') ... hat der Dichter sich geschickt Gelegenheit geboten, nicht nur seiner Darstellung im allgemeinen eine tiefere Bedeutung zu geben, sondern auch all diejenigen Stoffe, die, ohne mythischer Art zu sein, doch mit dem Grundgedanken seines Gedichtes zusammenhangen, zu erwahnen und in einem geschlossenen, aber doch du/3er- lich und innerlich mit der iibrigen Aus/iihrung verbundenen Ganzen zu verwer- werten (2 (my italics). Ernst ZINN claims, )&gt;So gibt die Rede des Pythagoras dem Horer den Schliussel zum Ganzen in die Handa3.

Scipio withers the suggestion: falsumn est enim, Manili, id totum, neque solum fictum, sed etiam imperite absurdeque fictum, etc. According to L. P.

In his recent book Brooks OTIS writes, &gt;The Pythagoras discourse embraces the entirety of Ovid's carmen perpetuum and represents metamorphosis as the universal key to the secrets of both nature and history&lt;((... )&gt;The chain of mythological metamorphoses-the constant process of transition that runs through his carmen perpetuum-can also be described in the language of science and philosophy 2. The gist of these opinions is that there is an intimate connection between the science and philosophy of the Pythagoras digression in Bk. I5, and the mythological subject-matter of the rest of the Metamorphoses, that by provi- ding a philosophical explanation for the phenomenon of transformation, the Pythagoras digression provides a coherent basis of unity for the manifold legends Ovid has related. They are, after all, only so many manifestations of a single process. This view is a natural one to adopt when one considers what the digression is about. It begins with a thumb-nail biography of Pythagoras - vir fuit hIic ortu Samius, sed fugerat una et Samon et dominos odioque tyrannidis exul sponte erat. (60-3)- and continues with an outline of his teachings. These embrace two main themes. The first is a denunciation of the eating of flesh. It is with this theme that the actual speech of Pythagoras begins and ends (lines 75-142. 459-478). These two passages, comprising 88 lines, or slightly over one-fifth of Pythag- oras' speech, are exhortatory in character, a plea for Pythagorean vege- tarianism. This is a new element in the Metamorphoses, and has no essential connection with anything that has gone before. The connection that does exist-Pythagoras' citation (lines 96ff.) of the Golden Age as a time when men had not defiled their lips with blood-is adventitious rather than inherent. It recalls i, IOI ff., although abstinence from flesh is not expressly stated as one of the qualities of the Golden Age there. Lines 96ff. are, therefore, only an illustration of Pythagoras' argument, not an inseparable part of it, so that the connection with Bk. i is on a superficial level. Pythagoras could have ex- pounded the same case using a different illustration, and the connection would have disappeared, although the substance of his argument would have 1 L'inquadramento filosofico delle Metamorfosi, in Ovidiana ed.

RE s. v. Ovidius Naso, I940) .</page><page sequence="4">The Speech of Pythagoras in Metamorphosess5 and the Structure of the Metamorphoses 343 remained unaffected. OTIS plausibly suggests that the calls to vegetarianism are &gt;&gt;designed to characterize the historical Pythagoras and thus to 'frame' his central philosophy. Ovid was not pleading for Pythagoras' special doctrine, but only providing a suitable ethopoeia(d. This part of the Pythagorean digression, which, as I have said above, amounts to about one-fifth of the whole, has no essential connection with the main body of the Metamorphoses. It serves the purposes of this episode of Bk. I5, not the structural purposes of the whole work. The second theme of Pythagoras' teaching is the doctrine of the trans- migration of souls 2. It is this theme which critics have regarded as a significant structural element, as a source of unity and coherence whose influence must be seen throughout the Metamorphoses. There are obvious affinities between the phenomenon of transmigration and the phenomenon of transformation. If the soul can be housed in a new shape, why should not the body take a new shape also? But Pythagoras' philosophy does not stop at the transmigration of souls. It is a philosophy of universal flux, not only in the world of the spirit, but also in the world of matter. Pythagoras begins with a statement of the doctrine of transmigration: morte carent animae semperque priore relicta sede novis domibus vivunt habitantque receptae (I58-9), but soon makes it clear that the principle of mutability has far wider impli- cations. It is not only souls in which change and permanence combine, it is a law of physical nature: omnia mutantur (I65) nihil est toto quod perstet in orbe. cuncta fluunt, omnisque vagans formatur imago (I77-8). )&gt;There is nothing which abides in the whole world. Everything is fluid, and every shape is of its nature transient&lt;(. Time is the image of transience- ipsa quoque adsiduo labuntur tempora motu, non secus ac flumen. neque enim consistere flumen, nec levis hora potest. (I79-8i)- but nothing is immutable: I Op. cit. p. 298. 2 The two themes overlap in 11. 459-62, where Pythagoras adduces the transmigration of souls as an argument against the eating of flesh: corpora, quae possint animas habuisse parentum aut fratrum aut aliquo iunctorum foedere nobis aut hominum certe, tuta esse et honesta sinamus neve Thyesteis cumulemus viscera mensis.</page><page sequence="5">344 DOUGLAS LITTLE nec species sua cuique manet, rerumque novatrix ex aliis alias reddit natura figuras (252-3). In a few passages it is difficult not to see a connection between Ovid as Pythag- oras and Ovid as mythographer: nil equidem durare diu sub imagine eadem crediderim: sic ad ferrum venistis ab auro, saecutla (259-6I). It is reasonable to relate this to Ovid's account of the Four Ages in Bk. i (89ff), a progressive degeneration of human character and circumstances. Pythagoras refers to the Golden Age at lines 96-8 also: at vetus illa aetas, cui fecintus aurea nomen, fetibus arboreis et, quas humus educat, herbis fortunata fuit nec polluit ora cruore, although, as I have pointed out1, the connection here is not clear-cut. Lines 43I-435 have unmistakable reference to the Augustan conclusion of Bk. 15: nunc quoque Dardaniam fama est consurgere Romam, Appenninigenae quae proxima Thybridis undis mole sub ingenti rerutn fundamina ponit. haec igitur formam crescendo mutat et olim immensi caput orbis erit. With this passage compare for instance Jupiter's affirmation to Venus of the future greatness of Rome and Augustus: quid tibi barbariem gentes que ab utroque iacentes oceano numerem? quodcunque habitabile tellus sustinet, huius erit; pontus quoque serviet illi (829-31). There are therefore obvious grounds for the claim that the philosophy of Bk. I5 provides an underlying basis of unity for the collected myths of trans- formation which form the body of the Metamorphoses. It links them all by making it possible for us to interpret them all as manifestations of a single, eternal, universal law of change and renewal. The provision of a possibility, however, is not enough. Ovid must make a consistent attempt to persuade us to this interpretation, to persuade us to look at the Metamorphoses through the glass of Pythagorean metempsy- chosis, and see at last the one where before we had seen only the many. If Ovid meant the Pythagorean digression to underpin the structure of the poem, it was necessary for him to relate it to the rest of the work in such a way that the 1 v. above, p. 342.</page><page sequence="6">The Speech of Pythagoras inMetamorphoses 15 and the Structure of the Metamorphoses 345 reader would be encouraged to perceive and apply the correspondences. This means, of course, that the correspondences must exist, or rather, that it must be possible to deduce a coherent pattern of correspondence between what Pythagoras says, and what is maintained or implied elsewhere. Twenty-five years ago Hermann FRANKEL expressed the doubt that such a pattern exists. He credits Ovid with the apparent intention: )&gt;The reader cannot help correlating the sermon (i. e. the speech of Pythagoras) with the subject and title of the Metamorphoses. Whether or not the author meant it so, it seems as if the essay on the universal law of change was to provide the theoretical background for the epic of transformations( '-but denies him the execution: ))But the accord between the doctrine as expounded here and the substance of the entire work is only superficial; in essence, the Pythagoras speech is incongruous to the main theme of the long poem. While the epic is replete with mythological fables 'not to be believed', the philosophical exposi- tion stops short of the miracle. It is conceived throughout in a rationalizing spirit, and thus it contradicts rather than clarifies the purport of the stories. This time, the swich from one plane of reality to another does not come off well((2. As can be seen from the opinions of ZINN, ALFONSI and OTIs quoted above, the question raised by FRANKEL has made little difference to modern inter- pretation of the Metamorphoses. W. C. STEPHENS, while admitting that )&gt;Frankel has seized upon a real weaknessa13, claims that there is no contradic- tion between the Pythagorean philosophy and the Ovidian mythology: #When Ovid wanted to be unmistakably serious, he faced the chasm that separates the mythical from the rational or actual. A Vergil could bridge the chasm, as he does in Anchises' speech in Aeneid 6. But Ovid, lenerorum lusor amorum, could not expect his deeper meaning to be sought. He was compelled to insert a 'rationalizing' passage, not 'contradicting' but complementing the bulk of the poem. With this clue we are to look back at the fourteen books that precede and attempt to estimate their significance . .. These (sc. Pythagorean) patterns of thought pervade the work, and it may be doubted whether it is really an artistic fault to recapitulare them at the end&lt;44. R. CRAHAY and J.

Compared with this unfavourable reaction, positive response to FRANKEL'S view has been insignificant. A measure of support is laconically implied by WILKINSON: #From transmigration the theme widens to embrace the doctrine that all things are in flux. Even here there is still a superficial connection at least with the main theme of the poem. . . but it is tenuous enough, and in essence literary rather than philosophic #3. (my italics). S. D 'ELIA finds FRANKEL 'S appraisal 'acuto ed esatto', and in his brief discussion, writes: )&gt;Ma, dimostrato che le anime sono immortali, e passano da uno corpo all' altro, che tutto muta e assume nuova forma ... resta un problema: questo non ha nulla a che vedere con le metamorfosi operate nel poema da dei e dee ... si parla della generazione degli insetti o dell' avvicendamento degli imperi ma non si discute la materia mitica che costituisce l'argomento del poema4#.

There was a gap between philosophy and mythology, between truth and fiction, and Ovid's intelligence, eminently sane and not prone to illusions, was well aware of it. At Tristia 2, 63-4 he refers to the Metamorphoses in terms which might incline one to doubt whether he believed that myth could be explained on a basis of philosophy, and, in particular, whether he would have thought the effort convincing or worth making in the poem. He describes the miraculous transformations which are its subject-matter as 'incredible': inspice maius opus, quod adhuc sine fine tenetur, in non credendos corpora versa modos. ))Look into that greater work, which is still unfinished, an account of bodies transformed in ways not to be believed((. A critic could hardly wish for a more explicit denial of the reality of the myth-world of the Metamorphoses'. Tristia 4, 7 is written to a friend from whom Ovid has received no letter in two years. Ovid hopes that his friend has written many letters, and that mere accident has prevented them from reaching him. In fact, Ovid is sure it must be so- quod precor, esse liquet (1. ii), &gt;&gt;It is beyond doubt that my prayer is already fulfilled(4-because his friend's loyalty is unquestionable. The poet will believe anything, rather than that his friend's affection has waned: credam prius ora Medusae Gorgonis anguineis cincta fuisse comis, esse canes utero sub virginis, esse Chimaeramit a truce quae flammis separet angue leam, quadrupedesque hominis cum pectore pectora iunctos, tergeminumque virum tergeminumque canem, Sphingaque et Harpyias serpentipedesque Gigantas, centimanumque Gyan semibovemque virum. haec ego cuncta prius, quam te, carissime, credam mutatum curam deposuisse mei (II -20). This passage-a list of phenomena so incredible that only a dimunition of his friend's loyalty would be an even more fantastic reversal of nature-makes interesting reading in the light of the Metamorphoses, where Ovid uses or refers to six of these myths. The snaky head of Medusa (11. II-2I) becomes the trophy of Perseus at M. 4, 6I5. Scylla (virginis, 1. 13) is turned into the dog-loined maiden by the wiles of Circe at M. I4, 5ff. Nestor recounts the 1 Ovid's language here, in a passage unambiguously undercutting the miraculous in the M., is reminiscent of Pythagoras: v. below, p. 353.</page><page sequence="9">348 DOUGLAS LITTLE fight between Lapiths and Centaurs (quadrupedes, 1.

The sight of Cerberus (tergeminum . . . canem, 1. i6), dragged from Hell by Hercules with the chain still around the mid-most of his three necks, literally petrifies a bystander at M. IO, 65-7. The snake-footed Giants (serpentipedes Gigantas, 1. I7) make their sacrilegious attempt to scale heaven at M. I, I5Iff. (cf. I, I84), and the Minotaur (semibovem virum, 1. I8) brings disgrace upon the royal family of Crete at 8, I55 ff. Myths narrated in the Metamorphoses are given the same cavalier treatment in Amores 3, 6. Ovid, anxious to get to his mistress, finds his way blocked by a river in flood. The situation is beyond human resources, and he thinks longingly of supernatural devices: nutnc ego, quas habuit pinnas Danaeius heros, terribili densum cum tulit angue caput, nunc opto currumt, de quo Cerealia primunt semina venerunt in rude missa solum (I3-I6). At M. 4, 6I5ff. Perseus (Danaeius heros, 1. I3), after decapitating Medusa, carries out extensive travels on his winged sandals: inde per immensumn ventis discordibus actus nunc huc, nutnc illuc exemplo nubis aquosae fertur et ex alto seductas aethere longe despectat terras totumque supervolat orbem, etc. (62I-4), and eventually saves Andromeda by making an air-borne attack on the sea- monster: utque Iovis praepes, vacuo cum vidit in arvo praebentem Phoebo liventia terga draconem, occupat aversum (7I4-6). Triptolemus, (the charioteer of 11. 15-I6) riding in Ceres' serpent-drawn chariot, distributes the seed corn far and wide over the earth at M. 5, 646ff: iam super Europen sublimis et Asida terram vectus erat iuvenis: Scythicas advertitur oras (648-9). Such marvels may make a good story, but they are pure fables, the fictions of old poets, which have never been seen on earth nor ever will be: prodigiosa loquor, veterum mendacia vatum: nec tulit haec umquam nec feret ulla dies (Am. 3, 6, I7-I8). At Amores 3, I2, Ovid asserts that the fertile licence of poets is unbounded, and not limited by historical veracity: exit in immensum fecunda licentia vatum obligat historica nec sua verba fide (4I-2).</page><page sequence="10">The Speech of Pythagoras in Metamorphoses I5 and the Structure of the Metamorphoses 349 This is Ovid's sober judgement on the nature of his material in the Meta- morphoses. It seems to me inherently unlikely that the attempt which critics have made to give this material coherence and a deeper significance by inviting it to be examined against the yard-stick of philosophica fides would achieve convincing results. It seems unlikely also that Ovid would have believed himself that positive results would emerge from such an examination. Already in M. i there is dichotomy between philosophy and mythology. In his 'philosophical' account of the creation, Ovid gives two versions of the creation of man-either the creator of the universe made him from divine seed, or Prometheus moulded him from earth and water: natus homo est, sive hunc divino semine fecit ille opi/ex rerum, mundi melioris origo, sive recens tellus seductaque nuper ab alto aethere cognati retinebat semina caeli, quam satus Iapeto, mixtam pluvialibus undis, finxit in effigiem moderantum cuncta deorum (78-83). Yet at line 363 we find Deucalion longing for the art his father Prometheus to restore the human race all but annihilated in the Deluge: o utinam possim populos reparare paternis artibus atque animas formatae infundere terrae! (363-4). It has not taken the poet long to forget the philosopher. At I, 26ff. the organi- sation of the universe is conceived in terms of Stoic cosmogony-aether and air, because of their volatility, naturally occupy the upper reaches, water and earth, because of their weight, the lower reaches: ignea convexi vis et sine pondere caeli emicuit summaque locum sibi fecit in arce; proximus est aer illi levitate locoque, densior his tel/us, elementaque grandia traxit et pressa est gravitate sua; circumfluus umor ultima possedit solidumque coercuit orbem (26-3I)1. In Bk. 2, the Stoic cosmogony has been forgotten. When Ceres appeals to Jupiter to remedy the chaos caused by Plhaethon's conflagration, she says: qutodsi nec fratris nec te mea gratia tangit, at caeli miserere tui. circumspice utrumque: fumat uterque polus ! quos si vitiaverit ignis, atria vestra ruent.

If the fire weakens them, it will be your palace that will fall. Even Atlas is under strain. He can hardly keep the searing axis on his shoulders(4. It is no longer their intrinsic volatile nature which sustains aether and air above the earth, but the poles and Atlas. At I, 56 a naturalistic explanation is given for the origin of lightning: cum fulminibus facientes fulgora ventos- Athe winds, which cause the flashes and the bolts of lightning&lt;, a reference to the belief that lightning was caused by the collision of winddriven clouds. I4I lines later we find Jupiter claiming to control the lightning: mihi, qui fulmen, qui vos habeoque regoque (i97); at 253 he is deliberating whether to blast the earth with it or not: iamque erat in totas sparsurus fulmina terras; and the thunderbolts themselves are not a side-effect of high wind, but weapons forged by the hands of the Cyclops: tela . .. manibus fabricata Cyclopum (I, 259). At 2, 330 Ovid uses language which foreshadows the scientific caution of Pythagoras himself. After the death of Phaethon the sun hid his head in grief, and was said to have left the world lightless for a day. Ovid reports the story with some misgivings as to its credibility: si modo credimus'. At 6, 62ff. Ovid describes the subtle gradations of colour in Arachne's web. He compares it to the rainbow, whose origin he incidentally explains by natural causation: illic et Tyrium quae Plurura sensit aenum texitut et tenues parvi discriminis umbrae, qualis ab imbre solet percutsso solibus arcus inficere ingenti longum curvamine caelum (6I-64). At II, 590 the rainbow is once more the pathway of Iris known to myth: induitur velamina mille colorum Iris et arcuato caelum curvamine signans tecta petit iussi sub nube latentia regis (589-9I). 1 cf. I2, 359-60, where there is more than a grain of irony in Nestor's account of an incident in the fight between Centaurs and Lapiths: sed procul a telo Theseus veniente recessit Pallados admonitu: credi sic ipse volebat- and I3, 733-4: the monster Scylla was a girl once, *if all the traditions of the poets are not false (, si non omnia vates ficta reliquerunt.</page><page sequence="12">The Speech of Pythagoras in Metamorphoses I 5 and the Structure of the Metamorphoses 35 I dIris put on her dress of a thousand colours and marking the sky with her bow-shaped curving path she made for the king's palace lying unseen beneath a cloud, as she had been ordered. (( Warned by these examples, we should proceed cautiously in any attempt to extract a coherent philosophical basis for myth from M. i5.

'God' in the Metamorphoses is the anthropomorphic divinities of the Graeco-Roman pantheon, immortal and almost omnipotent, but in every other respect cast in the same mould, or tarred with the same brush, as human beings. Their full-blooded adventures-by no means so shrouded in mystery and inscruta- bility that they require greater explanation than those of their mortal counter- parts-have just been followed by the reader through eleven thousand lines. The question quae fulminis esset origo has already been decided. Ovid gives two causes' and, in a work of mythology, they are incompatible. For Ovid the mythographer, it is Jupiter, using the weapons forged by the Cyclops; for Ovid the philosopher, it is the result of natural forces. The philosophical expla- nation at I, 56 does not underpin, it undermines the myth, and Pythagoras' return to the question here lhas, for a reader bearing in mind what Ovid wrote in Bk. i, the same effect. This is true also of Pythagoras' discussion of the cause of thunder: Iuppiter an venti discussa nube tonarent (70). In the philosophical exordium of Bk. i, in the rationalistic context of Stoic cosmogony, thunder is made, along with the lightning-causing winds, the work of 'a god', cura dei (I. 48), who illic (sc. aere) et nebulas, illic consistere nubes iussit et humanas motura tonitrua mentes et cunt fulminibus facientes fulgora ventos (I, 54-6).

Yet at 3, 30I the thunder has become part of the panoply of the arch-seducer. Arraying himself to appear to Semele as he does to Juno, Jupiter aethera conscendit vultuque sequentia traxit nubila, quis nimbos immixtaque fulgura ventis addidit et tongitruxs et inevitabile fulmen (3, 299-30I). .. . went up into heaven, and, with a look, brought together the obedient clouds. To them he added rain-storms and the flashes of lightning mixed with wind, and the peals of thunder and the lightning bolts which none can escape((. In Bk. I5, Ovid far from trying to integrate the philosophy with the mythology by eliminating this discrepancy, points to it plainly by baldly opposing the philosophical and mythical alternatives. This is a needless discordance if the Pythagoras digression is meant to provide a philosophic basis for myth. In the speech itself, Pythagoras expresses some doubt as to the credibility of poets, or of poets, at least, who, like Ovid, have taken their material from myth. In a list of rivers which have changed their course or character, Pytha- goras mentions the Anigros, whose water was once pure, but is now better left untouched since illic lavere bimembres vulnera clavigeri quae fecerat Herculis arcus (283-4). To the explanation he appends the cautious proviso nisi vatibuts omnis eripienda fides. )&gt;Unless poets are completely untrustworthy(( (282-3). He neither confirms nlor denies the old belief that the spine of dead men can turn into a snake, contenting himself with the uncommittal: sunt qui ... ... credant (389-90). In three passages he goes well beyond this academic suspension of j udgement. He is succinctly sceptical of the feathered men of Pallene qui soleant levibus velari corpora plumis, cum Tritoniacam noviens subiere paludem (357-8). haud equidem credo is his terse comment (359), and he contrasts such fictions with uncontested facts: siqua fides rebus tamen est addenda probatis (36I).

In Bk. I4, I04ff., Aeneas, guided by the Sibyl, descends to the underworld and learns of a war-troubled destiny from the shade of Anchises: paruit Aeneas et formidabilis Orci vidit opes atavosque suos umbramque senilem magnanimi Anchisae; didicit quoque iura locorum, quaeque novis essent adeunda pericula bellis (II6-II9). The gloomy kingdom of Pluto and Proserpine gets short shrift from the sage of Samos. He dismisses it as an 'empty name', and, more explicitly, as a 'fabrication of poets': quid Styga, quid tenebras et nomina vana timetis, materiem vatum, falsique pericula mundi? (I54-5). In Bk. 5, 346 ff., Ovid gives a circumstantial description of the firebreathing giant Typhoeus crushed for impiety under the weight of Sicilian Etna: vasta Giganteis ingesta est insula membris Trinacris et magnis subiectum molibus urguet aetherias ausum sperare Typhoea sedes. nititur ille quidem pugnatque resurgere saepe; dextra sed Ausonio manus est subiecta Peloro, laeva, Pachyne, tibi, Lilybaeo crura premuntur, degravat Aetnta caput; sub qua resupinus harenas eiectat flammamque ferox vomit ore Typhoeus. saepe remoliri luctatur pondera terrae oppidaque et magnos devolvere corpore montes. inde tremit tellus, et rex pavet ipse silentum, ne pateat latoque solum retegatur hiatu inmissusque dies trepidantes terreat umbras (5, 346-358). Hermes 98,3 23</page><page sequence="15">354 DOUGLAS LITTLE At I4, I he alludes to this legend again: iamque Giganteis iniectam faucibus Aetnen. The account which Pythagoras gives of Etna is less romantic: nec quae sulpureis ardet fornacibus Aetne ignea semper erit; neque enim fuit ignea semper. nam sive est animal tellus et vivit habetque spiramenta locis flammam exhalantia multis, spirandi mutare vias, quotiensque movetur, has finire potest, illas aperire cavernas; sive leves imis venti cohibentur in antris saxaque cum saxis et habentem semina flammae materiam iactant, ea concipit ictibus ignem, antra relinquentur sedatis frigida ventis; sive bitumineae rapiunt incendia vires luteave exiguis ardescunt sulpura fumis... (340-35I). Here Typhoeus is rationalized into a vent (spiramenta, 343) for the hot breath of earth', or a mass of friction-ignited matter (venti . . . materiam iactant, ea concipit ictibus ignem, 346. 348), or, most prosaic of all, into a burning pile of bitumen or sulphur (bitumineae vires, lutea sulpura, 350-I). The claim that the Pythagoras digression provides the )&gt;key to the whole work# rests in fact upon an essential confusion between the mythical and the natural. The philosophic basis which the Pythagoras digression provides is not for the metamorphoses of the poets, but for the phenomenon of change in the real world of nature. The introduction to his speech2 is clearly grounded in Stoic physics, that is, in contemporary science. ))These physical questions were one of the Stoics' main concerns, at least from the time of Posidonius. In all antiquity the fullest discussions of such matters are found in Seneca, Pliny and ps.-Aristotle, all of whom are strongly influenced by Posidonian Stoicism#3. Many of Pythagoras' examples are statements of verifiable fact. The first ioo liiies (I75-272) of his exposition of the doctrine of flux fall into this category. Lines I86-I9I are typical of this section: cernis et emensas in lucem tendere noctes, et iubar hoc nitidum nigrae succedere nocti. nec color est idem caelo, cum lassa quiete I Conceived, as in Stoic thought, as a living animal. 2 II, 67-7I, v. above, p. 351. 3 W.

The colour of the sky is different when everything lies inert in midnight sleep, and when the morning-star rides out radiant on his white horse, and it is different again when dawn tinges the world with its promise of light and makes it ready for the sun. a Change in the real world of nature is not important in the Metamorphoses, but it is only here, in this insignificant sphere of natural science, and not in the far more important sphere of myth, that the philosophy of Bk. I5 makes contact with the real subject-matter of the poem. The clearest case is Pythagoras' prediction of the future greatness of Rome: haec (sc. Roma) igitur formam crescendo mutat et olim immensi caput orbis erit (434-5). Here Pythagoras is not providing a scientific explanation for a mythical event, he is pointing to an historical process which can be interpreted philosophically as a manifestation of a universal law of change. The same may be said of the progressive decline which brought the world from the age of gold to the age of iron: nil equidem durare diu sub imagine eadem crediderim: sic ad ferrum venistis ab auro, saecula (I5, 259-26I). This is not a transformation comparable with that of Jupiter into a bull or Tereus into a hoopoe. It is the result of a natural and inescapable evolution, analagous to the geomorphological changes which, in the following lines, Pythagoras instances as further proofs of this law: sic totiens versa est fortuna locorum. vidi ego, quod fuerat quondam solidissima tellus, esse fretum, vidi factas ex aequore terras, et procutl a pelago conchae iacuere marinae (26I-4). The account of the Four Ages in Bk. i (89ff.) is followed by an account of such a change as Pythagoras mentions here, the inundation of the earth, with the complete reversal of the old order of things (I, 292ff.). In Bk. i, the flood is brought oin by the wrath of Jupiter as punishment for the outrageous depravity of the human race. Here, although the iron age and the flood are again associated, Jupiter is excluded, as if intentionally. His agency is needless in a world where things, by their inherent nature and the nature of the universe in which they exist, are subject to change. Consequently the inundating of 23*</page><page sequence="17">356 DOUGLAS LITTLE earth here is not a result of human decline to the iron age. These are independent but parallel manifestations of a law which needs no deus ex machina. The imagination of the poet might unite them, but the union is unnecessary and misleading. If the world existed without men it would still change, simply because it does exist. The cases of 'miraculous' transformation which Pythagoras does refer to are not incompatible with this interpretation. It is essential here not to confuse what we regard as the real world of nature with what Ovid and his contem- poraries regarded as such. We must be prepared to accept that what appears myth to us may not have seemed so to the poet. At 4, 285 ff., he narrates the story of how the nymph Salmacis fell in love with the boy Hermaphroditus; how in the waters of the nymph's pool, they were finally merged in one body; how Hermaphroditus prayed to his parents Hermes and Aphrodite that every man who descended into the pool should become a hermaphrodite like himself; and how his prayer was granted. At I5, 3I9 Pythagoras asks cui non audita est obscenae Salmacis undae? )&gt;Who has not heard of the vile waters of Salmacis ? ( We need not assume that by mention of the name Salmacis Ovid is conferring the authority of Pythagoras on the myth associated with the pool. It would seem rather that whatever Ovid may have thought of the origin of its peculiar characteristic-and he is silent here on this point-he did not doubt its existence. Some of the more outlandish examples of change which Pythagoras quotes are attested by Graeco-Roman science, or at least referred to by writers as existing beliefs. The incendiary properties of the spring in Epirus: admoturnque Athamanas aquis accendere lignum narratur (I5, 3II-2), are paralleled by those of a spring at Dodona whose existence is attested by Pliny: in Dodona Iozis Ions, cum sit gelidus et immersas faces extinguat, si extincta admoveantur, accendit (Plin, N. H. 2, 228). Eudoxus1 confirms Pytha- goras' assertion that the spring of Clitorium induces antipathy to wine: Clitorio quicumnque sitim de fonte levavit, vina fugit gaudetque meris abstemius undis (I5, 322-3). Pythagoras gives two explanations, one natural: seu vis est in aqua calido contraria vino (324), one, for which he does not vouch himself but merely reports as a local tradition, bordering on the mythical: 1 vinum taedio venire iis, qui ex Clitorio lacu biberint, ait Eudoxus.

H. 31, 13.</page><page sequence="18">The Speech of Pythagoras in Metamorphoses 15 and the Structure of the Metamorphoses 357 sive, quod indigenae memorant, Amythaone natus, Proetidas attonitas postquam per carmen et herbas eripuit luruis, purgamina mentis in illas misit aquas odiumque meri permansit in undis (325-8). The philosopher leaves the question open. It is likely that these examples, and others involving water which Pythagoras quotes, have a direct source in Pythagorean philosophy. ManIy of )4es incredibilia accumules par Ovide pour illustrer soit les changements intervenus dans certains lieux, en particulier en rapport avec les eaux, soit les metamorphoses provoquees par ces eaux, trouvent ... des paralleles dans un petit recueil de Paradoxa que Sotion avait consacr6 aux rivieres, aux sources et aux 6tangs1 I. That is, they are to be classed as philosophy rather than folk-lore. On the birth of bees from the body of dead bulls, Pythagoras says: cognita res usu (365). It is a well-attested phenomenon 2. So is the peculiar reproductive process of the phoenix (392 ff.) 3, and the birth of frogs from mud (375ff.) 4. Ovid's material in the Pythagoras digression, and his treatment of it, are in fact closer to Pliny's work in the Naturalis Historia than to his own in Bks. II4 of the Metamorphoses. Pliny was not writing a work of mythology, a history of transformations wrought by divine agency, but a work of serious scientific purpose, from which, he says in his preface, the marvel- lous is to be specifically excluded: neque admittunt (sc. libelli mei) excessus aut orationes sermonesve aut casus mirabiles vel eventus varios... rerum natura, hoc est vita, nanratur5. There is no reason for believing that Ovid was more scientific than his contemporaries, or that he detected fiction where they had been content to see fact. Pythagoras' examples are not instances of transfor- mation in the world of myth, but of what Ovid and others believed to be recorded natural phenomena. There are only three of his examples which cannot be so classified, which belong indisputably to the realm of myth rather than to that of Graeco-Roman science. Two of these are given as possible alternative explanations for pheno- mena whose existence is 'scientifically' attested (28I-4. 322-8) 6. It is noteworthy that in both cases Pythagoras does not himself affirm the truth of the explanations, but merely quotes them as assertions by others. The third is the tradition of the Symplegades, the clashing ship-crushing rocks. For Pliny, 1 R. CRAHAY et J. HUBAUX, Op. cit. p. 286. 2 cf. Varro R. R. 3, i6, 4; Colum. R. R. 9, I4, 6. 3 Plin. N.

The parallels between Ovid on the one hand and scientists and philosophers such as Pliny, Varro, Fabianus Papirius, Nigidius Figulus and Strabo on the other have been collected by J. LAFAYE, Les Me'tamorphoses d'Ovide et leurs modeles grecques, pp. 25I ff., and discussed by W. C. STEPHENS Op. cit. pp. 69ff. 6 v. above, p. 352 and p. 356.</page><page sequence="19">358 DOUGLAS LITTLE the tradition is fabulous: Cyaneae ab al/is Sytmplegades appellaztae traditaeque fabulis inter se concucurissel. Pythagoras quotes it with apparent acceptance: timuit concursibus Argo undarum sparsas Symplegadas elisarum (337-8) 2, This is an inconsistency in Pythagoras' otherwise rational account, and dif- ficult to explain satisfactorily. It may be due merely to carelessness on Ovid's part-perhaps he forgot that at the time he was supposed to be philosophi- zing3. In any case the three together hardly add up to a justification for claiming that Ovid's Pythagoras is there to establish a rational basis for mythology. Nor is this claim supported by the argument that the philosophiy of B1k. I5 justifies the myth of Bks. I-I4 in that both are concerned with transformation. Whether a change is to be regarded as mythical or Inot, depends not so much on what happened-and Ovid would not be the man to deny that truth may be stranger than fiction-but why it happened, what the cauisative agent was. In Bk. I5 it is not the agency of an anthropomorphic deus ex machina, but a law of nature working through the slow process of time. The existence of te law can be deduced empirically, and can be confirmed by the observation of continuing phenomena: vidi ego, quod fuerat quondam solidissima tellus, esse fretum (262-3). The interpretation of the phenomena may be faulty, or the phenomena themsel- ves may be imperfectly observed: nonne vides, quaecumque mora fluidove calore corpora tabescunt, in Parva animalia verti? (362-3), but the observation is based on a real physical process, and nothing is needed to confirm or correct the interpretation but more careful observation. With the myths of the Metamorphoses, the situation is different. There is no physical process underlying the transformation of Daphne into a laurel-tree (I, 545 ff.). It is an aetiological fiction, invented to explain why the laurel was important in IN. H- 4,92. 2 cf. 7, 62-3- 3 As he does at I5, 426-30: clara fuit Sparte, magnae viguere Miycenae, nec non et Cecropis, nec non Amphionis ayces: vile solum Sparte est, altae cecidere Mycenae; Oedipodioniae quid sunt, nisi nomina, Thebae? quid Pandioniae restant, nisi nornen, Athenae? As a statement of Ovid, the contemporary of Augustus, this makes sense. In the mouth of Pythagoras, the (alleged) contemporary of Numa, it is anachronistic nonsense.</page><page sequence="20">The Speech of Pythagoras in MetamorphosesI5 and the Structure of the Metamorphoses 359 the worship of Apollo. There is no physical process underlying Callisto's transformation into a bear (2, 474ff.). It is a similar aetiological fiction, explai- ning the origin of the constellation Arctus. When Cadmus and Harmonia are changed into snakes (4, 576ff.), the change is clearly miraculous. From living human personalities, they are, in fulfilment of a prophecy given long before', changed into snakes before the eyes of their terrified companions: dixit et, ut serpens, in longam tenditur alvum durataeque cuti squamas increscere sentit nigraque caeruleis variari corpora guttis. in pectusque cadit pronus, commissaque in unum paulatim tereti tenuantur acumine crura (4, 576-80). This is a change of different character from the transformation of man into snake referred to by Pythagoras: sunt qui, cum clauso putre/acta est spina sepulcro, mutari credant humanas angue medullas (I5, 389-go). Pythagoras cautiously refrains from giving the statement on his own authority, and it is not a change pictured taking place before the eyes of bewildered spectators. The human body is buried; the spine putrefies; some believe it turns into a snake: it looks like a snake, and snakes frequent the stones of tombs. There are obviously links missing in the evidence, but this change has much less in common with the miraculous transformations of myth than with other natural changes quoted by Pythagoras; e. g. that of caterpillar into butterfly: quaeque solent canis frondes intexere filis agrestes tineae (res observata colonis), ferali mutant cum papilione figuram (I5, 372-4). I would suggest therefore that the attempt to unify the Metamorphoses by appealing to the Pythagoreanism of Bk. 15, is unconvincing. It does not take into account Ovid's own scepticism towards mythology, which, as poet, he may ignore, but which, having cast himself as philosopher, he must come to terms with. It overlooks the conflicts between myth and 'philosophy' which occur in the earlier books of the Metamorphoses, and, by obscuring the distinc- tion between the mere miraculous and the miraculous attested by the authority of science, it overlooks the inherent conflict between the prevalent unhesitating avowal of the mythological in the body of the work and the rational scepticism of Pythagoras. We may say with FRANKEL that )&gt;it seems as if the essay on the universal law of change was to provide the theoretical background for the epic of transformations&lt;(, but if we are to claim that the Pythagoreanism does in 1 v. 3, 97-8.</page><page sequence="21">360 DOUGLAS LITTLE: The Speech of ... fact give the work a deeper coherence, we must be able to say not only that it seems as if it was to provide the background, but that it should and does. In the light of the above argument, it would seem that it does not. Yet Ovid must have been aware of the relationship between the Pythagoreanism and his theme of shapes transformed, and there can be no doubt that it was for this reason that he chose to introduce this particular brand of philosophy. Why then does the correspondence between myth and philosophy remain so unsatisfactory and so unconvincing? The answer must be surely, not that Ovid was unaware of the discrepancy, but that he regarded it as a matter of indifference. He was not concerned, in other words, to integrate these two elements, which were, as he knew, essentially incompatible. He was not concerned to give unity to the Metamorphoses by a careful and consistent adaption to its main theme of a philosophy which systematized a view of the universe having an obvious if superficial relationship to that main theme. He was not concerned, in short, to produce a poem which was a self-consistent, unified structure. If this view is right, if Ovid was indifferent to the claims of consistency and unity, it is reasonable to ask why he included Pythagorean philosophy at all. Indifference to consistency and unity, however, is not to be confused with indifference to the effect to be gained by creating an impression of unity, and that is the purpose of the Pythagoras digression. Ovid included it because of its superficial correspondence with his subjectmatter, but the correspondence was not meant to be examined too closely. Just as there are many things in a beauty which are best seen in the dark: Nec lucem in thalamos totis admitte fenestris; aptius in vestro corpore multa latent (A. A. 3, 807-8), there are many things in the Metamorphoses which it is inconsiderate to expose too relentlessly to the searching light of critical analysis, and the role of philosophy is one of them. To the casual reader, it is a designed and satis- factory supplement to the variety of the rest of the work. To the laborious critic, it is only another proof of hasty and slipshod composition. It is a gesture towards unity which Ovid thought it politic to make, as giving his work some pretensions beyond those of a mere collection, but it is only a gesture. The poet did not take it very seriously, and neither should we. University of Otago DOUGLAS LITTLE Dunedin/New Zealand</page></plain_text>
