<plain_text><page sequence="1">STUDIES IN BALZAC II. CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF REALISM1 I. DEFINITION The terms "realism and naturalism" have been bandied about until, like worn coins, their value is scarcely discernible. To add to the confusion, there is some authority for using the two words inter- changeably. But for present purposes it is best to discriminate and define, and on the whole French and English critics leave one with the conviction that it is justifiable to make between realism and naturalism a distinction both of time and of degree. Chronologically, in nineteenth-century fiction, the best work of Balzac and of Flaubert stands for the earlier development of realism; while Zola and his school pushed that doctrine to its farthest extreme and baptized it le Naturalisme. To support the distinction, I may recall that M. Lanson does not include Balzac under his treatment of naturalism, which is happily defined by Mr. Wright2 as an "acute form" of realism. Then what is realism ? Can we still say, as Littr6 did in the eighties, that it is an "attachement a la reproduction de la nature sans id6al" ?3 But today we think of the "nature sans id6al" as rather the fetish of the naturalists. It is true that certain French critics, including Brunetiere, use realiste and naturaliste as practically synonomous. Else it would be difficult for Brunetikre to maintain (for all his fulminations against the latter-day school) that "les romans de Balzac ne sont des romans que dans la mesure of' ils sont naturalistes"; that Balzac was a naturalist in all senses of the word and that his excellence is to be judged by the degree to which he 1 The first study in this series appeared in Modern Philology, XIII (1915), pp. 193- 213, under the title of " Balzac and Cooper: Les Chouans." The present article attempts a synthesis of the various critical views of French realism, with the object of disengaging its qualities and factors as revealed in the Combdie humaine. The third study will deal with Balzac's method in general, and the fourth with the realistic method of one particular work. 2 C. H. C.

PRESTON DARGAN followed that doctrine.1 Evidently Brunetiere uses what he calls "le vrai naturalisme" as equivalent to our "realism," and it is in this sense that he defines the adjective, "naturalistes, c'est-h-dire . .. conformes a la r6alit6 de la vie."2 It is also in this sense that he quotes a seventeenth-century definition: "L'opinion qu'on appelle naturaliste ... est celle qui estime n6cessaire l'exacte imitation de la nature en toutes choses." Call it which you please, we have in this passage a classic war-cry extended to the concreter realism, though the word "nature" still remains vague. That subject-matter is better delimited by Duranty, who probably gave points to Zola, in his journal entitled le Realisme. He defines this term as "la reproduction exacte, complete, sincere, du milieu social, de l'6poque oti l'on vit."3 Thus in 1857-the date of Madame Bovary-the main articles of the creed were already posited as these four: exactness, completeness or universality of representa- tion, truth, and the socio-historical approach. The distinctions, from Brunetiere's austere standpoint, between realism and naturalism are well stated in the Avertissement to Le Roman naturaliste.4 Brunetiere says he wrote this book in order to "opposer les conditions d'un art vraiment naturaliste, qui sont: la probit6 de l'observation, la sympathie pour la souffrance, l'indulgence aux humbles, et la simplicit6 de l'execution, aux caracteres les plus g6neraux du naturalisme contemporain, lesquels sont au contraire la superstition de l'6criture 'artiste,' le pessimisme litt6raire, et la recherche de la grossieret6." Omitting the more exotic elements of the first formula, and bearing in mind especially the practice of Balzac and Flaubert, we may now arrive at a working definition of realism: It is the art of representing actuality, viewed largely from the material standpoint, in a way to produce as closely as possible the impression of truth. 1 Brunetibre, Honord de Balzac, pp. 134-35. 2 Ibid., p. 136. 3 Quoted by Wright, p. 760. 4 Pp. ii-iii. Cf. Sainte-Beuve's famous diatribe, in Nouveaux lundis, IV, 137-38, where the critic, admitting reality to be the "fond de la vie," yet protests against mere photography and flatness and insists upon the adjuncts of style, sentiment, and idealism. In connection with Madame Bovary, Sainte-Beuve defined the qualities of the new realism as "science, esprit d'observation, maturit6, force, un peu de duret6," Causeries du lundi, XIII, 363. 352</page><page sequence="3">STUDIES IN BALZAC 73 As for naturalism, it is virtually a reductio ad absurdum of the fore- going. The daring doctrine of Zola and Huysmans that Balzac was the master, whose method should be broadened by that of Stendhal to cover the psychological field, has really landed them in a field of quite another character. And their desire to exhibit "la v6rit6 toute nue" has justified such epigrams as that of Saintsbury: "The ambition of the Naturalists was to mention the unmentionable with as much fulness of detail as possible."' Balzac may have instituted the exploitation of la bate humaine, but the naturalist who made the phrase famous was obsessed by its half-truth; the natural- ist, says Meredith, "sees only the hog in nature and then takes nature for the hog." II. GENERAL QUALITIES In trying to establish a definition of realism, I have been led to anticipate its more usual qualities. Including those already given, as well as other more debatable characteristics, I submit the following list of features ascribable to various brands of realistic fiction. Reserving until later questions relative to technique and procedes, here are the main possibilities that realism presents in the realm of ideas: Truth, or correspondence with objective reality Materialism: Animalism, money, externality Impersonality The scientific viewpoint The claim to universality The documentary method, or technical erudition Tediousness Representation of mediocrity and triviality Solidity Sympathy with ordinary life Sociological features Let us take these in order. The question of truth, as applied to any given picture of life, is usually the most difficult to decide. If a critic asks himself, Does this correspond to life as I know it?, the answer will frequently be, No. But one should proceed to a I History of French Literature, p. 564. 353</page><page sequence="4">74 E. PRESTON DARGAN further question, Does this correspond to life as I can readily con- ceive of it ? Is it vraisemblable, if not absolutely vrai ? And is the representation self-consistent ? Then the answer, drawn from a good realist, is usually, Yes. In other words, the truth in Balzac may sometimes be a matter of simply reporting facts, but more frequently it will be a matter of transmuting and raising facts to the value of coherent and plausible symbols. The critics are almost unanimous in praising Balzac's knowledge of reality and his power of conveying it in transmuted terms. "This is where Balzac remains unshaken," says Henry James, "-in our feeling that with all his faults .... , his spirit has somehow paid for its knowledge." And he compares the French novelist to Shake- speare for his "charged consciousness of truth and his direct exposure of sensibility. "I Brunetiare, in the Roman naturaliste, disconcerts us a little by de- claring that "Balzac, a proprement parler, n'est pas un r6aliste." But why not ? Because he transforms reality, because he does not make a servile copy-like the naturalists, as we would say. Brunetiere is again juggling with our terms, but his opinion of Balzac stands out clearly enough: "Il met dans les caract6res une logique, et dans les d6veloppements de la passion une suite "-which they do not have in real life.2 Does that impair the artistic verity of monomaniacs like the Baron Hulot or Old Grandet, who say and do almost nothing that is not related to their master-passion? Brunetibre, at least, does not think so. "Ils sont donc vrais ... et ils sont vrais prdcis6ment en tant qu'ils cessent d'etre reels."3 Elsewhere this critic declares that no one has the faculty of arriving at truth like Balzac and that in spite of his romantic side-shows, his grandiose characters and his crude mysticism, the Comedie humaine is largely a rehabilitation of "l'humble vWrite."4 Similarly Saintsbury marvels at the novelist's "power of con- ferring apparent reality upon what the reader nevertheless feels to be imaginary and ideal. Everything is seen through a kind of distorting lens, yet the actual vision is defined with the most extraordinary 1 H. James, The Question of Our Speech; the Lesson of Balzac, p. 94. 2 Roman naturaliste, p. 5. 8 Ibid., p. 35. 4 Honor6 de Balzac, pp. 127, 133. 354</page><page sequence="5">STUDIES IN BALZAC 75 precision and in the most vivid colors."' By the "actual vision," I suppose Saintsbury means the detailed presentment of each particu- lar scene. If so, he agrees with Balzac's own dictum in the cele- brated Avant-propos de la Comedie humaine: the law of the novel is to "tendre vers le beau ideal. . . . Mais le roman ne serait rien si, dans cet auguste mensonge, il n'etait pas vrai dans les details."2 And elsewhere Balzac significantly reproves those vague idealists, like George Sand, who "courent dans le vide." Balzac then told the truth-granted. But did he tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth ? The phrases about the auguste mensonge and the "distorting lens" would make us doubt it, if we did not doubt it already. In that process of transmuting and solidi- fying reality, did he not mix some strange elements in the alembic ? Romantic and melodramatic exaggeration of character and incident certainly play a large part in his novels. It seems clear also that, like Zola and the Goncourts, Balzac dwelt willingly on the exceptional and even the pathological. Leslie Stephen declares that no such world as Balzac's was possible, because no such world could have continued to exist.3 But due allowance must of course be made for the romancer's right to choose the extraordinary, even the criminally interesting. It scarcely seems likely that Balzac laid equal emphasis on all sides of truth. Fromentin is quoted as saying of the naturalists: "Ils avaient I'air de r6volutionnaires, parce qu'ils n'affectaient d'ad- mettre que la moiti6 des v6rites n6cessaires."4 And Balzac himself laments that, since he painted things as they are, it has been foolishly said "que j'appartenais A l'6cole sensualiste et materialiste.'"5 On the whole, his work does produce a materialistic effect. There is no denying it, and his own denials, it has been pointed out, are perfunctory." He was as frank a Rabelaisian as any, he believed in force, food, money, and things, and the real issue is to discover to I Op. cit., p. 511. 2 (Euvres (M.

PRESTON DARGAN what fictional values his materialism led him. Here one may con- sider Brunetiere's onslaught against materialistic, especially natural- istic fiction: " C'est un art qui sacrifie la forme la matiare, le dessein a la couleur, le sentiment a la sensation, l'ideal au reel; qui ne recule ni devant la trivialitY, la brutalite meme, qui parle enfin son langage A la foule."I Among the questions that will repay investigation are these: does Balzac sacrifice form to matter, and if so, what is the effect on his style ? Does he pile on sensations, colors, coarseness of language and treatment ? Is he, like Zola, constantly comparing human beings to animals, according to the theory of the Avant- propos ?2 Or has he affinities with Stendhal, materializing psychology in terms of "la sensation, la physiologie, le fatalisme du tempera- ment ?"3 It is evident that Balzac's materialism will affect the method and quantity of his description. Both Brunetiere and Taine give a certain progression, the first logical, the second both logical and to some extent actual in its application to the novelist's method. Balzac, says the former, introduced the treatment of these chief material preoccupations: living, which depends upon eating, which depends upon money, which depends upon work, which depends upon a trade or profession. Then and thus would come the handling of "la diversit6 des conditions, chacune caract6ris~e par les traits qui lui sont propres," manifest in descriptions as well as in technically suitable dialogues and the very manipulations of the plot.4 The space given to money and to business affairs is among the most salient features of Balzac's work. His own business ventures gave him a knowledge in this field which he used better for imaginary people than for his own prosperity. He insists always on the importance of incomes and investments. Does he make these, e.g., in Euginie Grandet, correspond to the knowledge and nature of the particular character ? Such novels as Le Cousin Pons and Cesar Birotteau require, in their different ways, very careful following of the financial moves. Even the careless young men of the Pension 1 Rom. nat., p. 3. 2 The use of this analogy, which may be called animalism, will be more fully treated in the third study of this series. 3 Pellissier, p. 245. 4 Rom. nat., pp. 63-64.

They are figured out much closer than that. Brunetiere thinks Taine stresses too admiringly Balzac's preoccupa- tion with the money basis. Not even a "naturalistic" novel should repose entirely on this foundation and money probably occupies less -place in life than Balzac thought-" et pour cause."2 To pass to the next quality, does all this materialism of treatment mean that Balzac's world is mainly external, that he lacks psycho- logical and spiritual insight ? The consensus of opinion is that he lacks the second but not usually the first. Then how are his "souls" made up, if he shows us mainly the environment of body ? What is his recipe for fusing a character out of a soul apparently considered at best only as a collection of qualities and sentiments ? I do not know that one can answer such a question, for it may be that here we touch the secret of genius, the power of divination that Balzac accorded himself and that others have accorded him. But perhaps we can trace some of the ways in which Balzac at his best avoids the reproach of threatening externality. Brunetiere suggests one way when he says that such books as Eugenie Grandet are not fortuitous masses of notes collected before the conception of the masterpiece and then crowded in. They are rather "ceuvres compos6es par le dedans, et non pas fabriqudes par le dehors." Therefore "la brica- bracologie" occupies here only its lawful place.3 Still, in the lesser works-and in' the high-life characters-one may suspect the pre- dominance of bric-a-brac over psychology. The claims of realism to impersonality and universality of treat- ment are closely connected with its scientific pretensions. We know how Flaubert fought for the impartial accent and how nearly he reached it in Madame Bovary. Zola makes of this "d6sint6resse- ment" one of his chief doctrinal points. "Le romancier naturaliste affecte de disparaitre completement derriere l'action qu'il raconte." Such an attitude, he says, brings about the absence of moral judg- ments or indeed of any conclusiveness. Let us have nothing but 1 Gautier, Portraits contemporains, p. 77. 2 Rom. nat., p. 65. 8 Ibid., p. 111. 357</page><page sequence="8">78 E. PRESTON DARGAN facts. "L'auteur n'est pas un moraliste, mais un anatomiste qui se contente de dire ce qu'il trouve dans le, cadavre humain." And he objects that Balzac is continually obtruding his own personality.' Now it is true that Balzac frequently interrupts the story with rather inartistic remarks. But what is their nature ? Are they simply flamboyant interjections or do they constitute the more serious interference of partial or aggressively moral judgments ? In any conflict, does he show too decidedly to which side he leans ? If so, one may criticize his pretension to exploit all his known world in a highly scientific and self-suppressing manner. Here is his famous statement of the scientific (biological) idea, in the Avant-propos.2 After saying that his conception of the Comedie as an organism came from a comparison "entre l'humanit6 et l'animal- ite," he remarks on the triumph of GeoffroySaint-Hilaire, who showed the unity of composition of life (transformism) as modified into species by environment. Then: "Je vis que sous ce rapport, la societe ressemblait 'a la nature. La societe ne fait-elle pas de l'homme, suivant les milieux oi' son action se deploie, autant d'hom- mes diff6rents qu'il y a de varietes en zoologie ?" The conclusion is that there are "des especes sociales comme il y a des especes zoolo- giques." Whatever the false analogies, the fertile consequences of this theory for Balzac's fiction impose themselves. It means primarily the division of mankind into trades and professions. It should mean the scientific attitude in the collection and presentation of facts. It should also mean, as Brunetiere points out, not only an objectivity from the self-standpoint, but objectivity from the human standpoint, with a tendency to discard all anthropomorphism.3 Correspondingly, one may expect a certain interest in and development of other sciences-or pseudo-sciences-with the result that the whole earth may be viewed as a sphere for impartial observation. That is the universality I am speaking of, the realistic universality, which is to be carefully distinguished from the classical (Aristotelian) and romantic kinds. "La societe franqaise allait etre l'historien, je ne 1 Zola, Les Romanciers naturalistes, pp. 128-30. 2 (Euvres, I, 2. 3 Honor6 de Balzac, p. 161. 358</page><page sequence="9">STUDIES IN BALZAC 79 devais tre que le secr6taire"--but a secretary who recorded all contemporary history. The Comedie humaine will then be a social organism, with its parts linked by the reappearing characters. The next step will be in the documentary direction. Science, objects Brunetiare, now tries to persuade artists "que toutes leurs 'observations,' meme les plus vulgaires ... par la seule verit6 du detail et la fid6lit6 photographique de la reproduction, conservent pour l'avenir une valeur assur&amp;e de t6moignage historique."2 In Balzac, two kinds of "documents" may be expected: technical dis- quisitions by the author, with display of erudition in many special fields, and the use of such actual documents as a proclamation by Napoleon or a business prospectus. More widely, there is the con- scientious care in "getting up" a subject, the method of Flaubert in Salammb6. With reference to this work, Brunetibre has a whole damnatory article on "L'Erudition dans le roman."3 He also finds Balzac too much addicted to this specialization. The novelist's curiosity led him into various enquetes, which transform several stories into so many "recueils de documents." Le Cousin Pons, for instance, contains half-a-dozen complete biographies which seem superfluous.4 Are they really so, or do they sufficiently justify them- selves by furnishing that scientific solid basis which Brunetiere admits? He objects more particularly to "le document physio- logique et surtout pathologique." But diseases and deathbeds have their interest both of psychological revelation and of dramatic suspense. The real dangers of the documentary method are, first, that art and science should not be identified in their aims and technique and, second, that the scientific pretensions of a Zola or a Balzac are likely to be based on superficial knowledge and a mistaken use of science. But be it science or pseudo-science, one is not dispensed from seeking the results, artistic or the reverse, of such influences upon Balzac's fiction. It is generally admitted that positivism and naturalism have many links, of which Taine's essay on Balzac is not the sole example. The novelist is characterized by Oscar Wilde5 as offering I CEuvres, I, 5. 2 Rom. nat., p. 6. 8 Ibid., pp. 27-48. 4 Honor6 de Balzac, pp. 155, 158. 5 In The Decay of Lying. 359</page><page sequence="10">80 E. PRESTON DARGAN a "most remarkable combination of the artistic temperament with the scientific spirit." It is the latter quality which led Balzac to say and prove that his work had its geography, as it had its genealogy, places, things, persons, and facts.' One should then trace out Balzac's divisions and treatment of knowledge, observing how the artist's hand often modified the raw material. Let us not claim that it always did so. Let us admit the charges of frequent tediousness and ponder its causes. Taine himself admits that Balzac's pedantry is often misplaced. For instance: " Mme Claas, au lit de mort, laisse 6chapper des allusions physiologiques et des axiomes m6taphysiques dont heureusement elle 6tait incapable." This then is the semi-scientific author, talking behind his character, with "ses grands mots, son argot scientifique, son fatras philoso- phique."2 Again, long-windedness may proceed from the superstition of universality, from the compulsion to tell everything. Is it true, as Wright says, that it is especially in Balzac's financial operations that we find "his documentary method, the detailed reproduction of procedure" ?3 And this critic, among many others, complains of the tediousness of "description and enumeration, to the complete neglect of the plot." We shall have opportunity to test this apparent exaggeration; yet be it noted that even Taine observes that Balzac too often keeps us waiting and the essayist bluntly adds: "Il est d6sagr6able de faire antichambre."4 Descriptions are too long and, what is perhaps more serious, they are sometimes obscure or not synthesized. "Une description n'est pas une peinture ... ces compilations ne font rien voir." Only professional physiognomists could see the importance of the Chevalier de Valois' nose, as lengthily portrayed. Such long-windedness, Taine adds, "fausse l'impres- sion," for the imagination sees the object in a flash.5 A Balzacian description should then be tested in these respects: does it harmonize solidly, does it lead us to visualize, does it require shortening ? As will be seen later, a description does frequently harmonize around a central keynote. 1 (Euvres, I, 14. 2 Taine, Nouveaux essais de critique et d'histoire, p. 74. a Op. cit., p. 722. 4 Taine, op. cit., p. 67. 5 Ibid., p. 68. 360</page><page sequence="11">STUDIES IN BALZAC 81 Through lack of restraint, it is certain that latter-day naturalists have drifted into a patient and pointless recording of everything, with a tendency toward mediocrity and triviality of representation. Zola thus defends the method. A typically naturalistic hero must be mediocre. To stage grand or gigantic protagonists, he says, is quite romantic-and Balzacian! Beauty does not consist in enlarging anything, since "an equal level abases all heads"; it consists rather "dans la v6rit6 indiscutable du document humain."I This is sternly intransigent, and we scarcely expect Balzac to measure up to that uninteresting standard. We may find that he still frequently gives heroic proportions to his figures, while making their circumstances mediocre or trivial. Brunetiere objects to the realistic mania for reflecting "avec une minutieuse et puerile exacti- tude les moindres accidents de la realit6" and holds that one may represent the humblest lives and their circumstances only on this broad condition: "que dans la profondeur de leur abaissement on fasse luire un rayon d'id6al."2 Even "tales of mean streets" should be lifted from their environment and sympathetically universalized. What results from the foregoing as to the two qualities of solidity of workmanship, on the one hand, and of sympathy with ordinary life on the other ? Henry James, who thinks of our novelist as toiling through triviality "with huge feet fairly ploughing the sand of our desert," nevertheless roundly declares that "Balzac stands almost alone as an extemporizer achieving closeness and weight, and whom closeness and weight have preserved. .... Quantity and intensity are at once and together his sign . . . . [he] did not press hard in some places only to bear lightly in others," by falling into shallowness or sketchiness. Balzac doesn't throw dust in our eyes. He "goes in ... . for a portentous clearness, a reproduction of the real on the scale of the real. Though .... 'clearness sometimes fails"-that is, we fail to see the forest for the trees.3 Later, James states that "Balzac, like nature herself, abhorred a vacuum."4 How is this effect of solidity attained in detail? It is admitted even by Brunetiere, even for the half-dozen dossiers in Le Cousin Pons. 1 Zola, Romanciers naturalistes, pp. 127-28. 2 Rom. nat., pp. 7, 11. 8 James, The Lesson of Balzac, pp. 70-79. 4 Ibid., p. 105. 361</page><page sequence="12">82 E. PRESTON DARGAN The most remote of these help to constitute milieu in the first place, and in the second they establish the characters, so to speak, on the outside of the story's needs and therefore in a kind of real life.1 But is it worth while to build up an elaborate past for secondary characters in order that their brief appearances on the scene may accord with the careful "preparations" for their r6les ? At any rate: "c'est ce qui donne aux 'dessous' des romans de Balzac leur incomparable solidit&amp;." But Brunetiere does not try to make out a case for Balzac as a sympathizer with humble life. That trait he finds mainly in the exotic realists, in Dickens and George Eliot, in Dostoievsky and other Russians. One should compare George Eliot's serenity, her large patience and penetration into the "lot" of the humble, with the sentimental "galimatias" of Le Lys dans la Vallee.2 The danger of an overdone sympathy is, however, the danger of sentimentality. Pathos becomes bathos and the pathetic is really an inferior genre, because it confuses "l'6motion presque physique et l'6motion d'art."3 How does the main truth of this argument affect Balzac ? Does it leave him merely sentimental in his not very frequent passages of pathos ? Above all, does it leave him, with reference to the ordinary trend of life, sufficiently interested to retain our interest, whether or not he is moved to more overt sympathy ? The sociological preoccupations of Balzac have already been suggested in quotations from the Avant-propos4 and the subject will receive in a subsequent study the full treatment that it merits. I may indicate here that the roman de moeurs is, of its nature, concerned with social types, and that the titles of Balzac's novels frequently suggest his interest in a social status, category, or institution. The greater part of his generalizations and side remarks are also of this character. Bruneti re emphasizes these sociological aspects of the Comedie humaine: the universality of depiction, the representation by classes, with close study of their ressorts, Balzac's crusade in behalf of the family, his Comtism and Catholicism.' 1 Honore de Balzac, pp. 156-57. 2 Rom. nat., pp. 210-23, passim. 3 Ibid., p. 8. 4 See supra, p. 358. 5 Honore de Balzac, pp. 165 ff. 362</page><page sequence="13">STUDIES IN BALZAC 83 III. TECHNICAL ELEMENTS In this division I will only throw out suggestions and provide a working skeleton which can be amplified or arranged to suit each novel. Balzac's fiction will offer generally these elements for analysis: ExPosITIoN: Topography. Order of the donnres. Quantity of space. PLOT AND COMPOSITION: Cumulative effect. Use of documents and episodes. CHARACTERS: Accumulation. Harmonizing. Order of the biographical and psychological data. DESCRIPTION: 1. Subjects a) Persons and dress (gestures, keynotes). b) Indoor milieu. c) Outdoor milieu. Topography. d) Historical background-local color. e) Of conditions and manners. 2. Kinds a) En masse, concentered or not. b) By scattered detail-repetitions, etc. DETAIL: Multiplicity; characteristic or causal; vivid and picturesque; exact and historical; unrelated or insignificant. STYLE: 1. Kind: Materialistic, technical, "artiste," cumbersome, colorless, or simple. 2. Components: Diction (proper names), technical terms, dialogue, figures, etc. A Balzacian exposition, like the head of a comet, bulks larger than the rest and frequently tries the patience of the reader. The first thirty or forty pages, especially if there is no break' in the volume, will furnish most of the matter for analysis. Much might be quoted from Balzac in defense of his long expositions and descrip- tions. Occasionally he is apologetic, but more usually he is down- right in declaring that such and such a preamble, topographical, socio-historical, or biographical, is essential to the thorough under- standing of what follows. That is what the reader should decide 1 In spite of the usual solid printing of the Comddie humaine, Balzac intended that chapter headings and divisions should appear. 363</page><page sequence="14">84 E. PRESTON DARGAN in each individual case. Is it better, for instance, to give the personal history of a character at the beginning, simply and perhaps tire- somely, in the old-fashioned way ? Or is it better to adopt the method of in medias res, as Brunetiere praises it in Flaubert: to begin the story at once, then presently "immobilize" the person in a suitable moment of revery and recall within him the previous train of action ?1 In about one-third of his stories, Balzac uses some form of beginning in medias res; the question would be why he does so. Another arrangement, as employed by the clever technicians of our rapid days, is to avoid mass at any cost and scatter all forms of description and "informations"2 in broken fragments throughout. Is a Balzacian plot a simple or a complex affair ? It is said to be fairly simple when the author is mainly interested in displaying character,3 and it is known to be very complex in such studies as Cesar Birotteau and Une Tendbreuse affaire, which would require, according to Taine,4 a financier and a magistrate respectively to follow perfectly their convolutions. Occasionally we have a com- pound rather than a complex plot. The doubtfully cohering parts of Le Cousin Pons or of the Histoire des Treize provide a plot of this character. Several critics5 show how La Femme de trente ans is probably the worst case of such patchwork. It consists of six originally distinct short stories, hastily joined together. The heroine had for a time six names and she remains to this day six different characters. But the critics6 mostly agree that Balzac's composition is usually of a superior kind, granting that he is at liberty to do something besides narrate. Admitting episodes, "encyclopedic zeal," docu- ments of various kinds and descriptions galore, it is nevertheless contended that he fuses and inspires all this with his central idea. The point then is in each case to determine how such material is linked with the action of the story. 1 Le Roman naturaliste, pp. 161, 163. 2 Together, often, with dialogue and narration itself-a sort of driving four-in-hand.

James, etc. 364</page><page sequence="15">STUDIES IN BALZAC 85 In narration proper, is the action swift or dilatory ? Is it fre- quently "decomposed" into so many itemized parts, or what is the novelist's recipe for suggesting the flight of time in a way to com- bine artistic plausibility with few and simple indications ? This has been praised as one of Balzac's best devices. Does he narrate by rapid dialogue in the manner of Dumas pare and the roman- feuilleton Perhaps the very simplicity of the straight narrative portions will leave them realistic and natural enough,' but less susceptible of analysis than the descriptions. Balzac's characters rise up amid a cluttering environment. They need to be tremendously strong to pass Kipling's test of "standing on their feet," while, so to speak, their household goods sweep by in a flood. Therefore they are frequently monomaniacs, they are possessed by a ruling passion that dominates the book. "Mais ces types 6normes," says Lanson, "sont reels, a force de determina- tion morale et physique."2 Are they rather types than characters, or are they great as both ? Balzac's own ideal was that they should "faire concurrence a l'6tat civil."3 Are the secondary characters equally differentiated and by what means ? If they bear mainly trade-marks, they may incur Brunetiere's dry objection that being a hardware merchant or a cobbler need not greatly differentiate the quality of one's loves or hates.4 Any character may become stressed by the repetition of a favorite tic or "gag," and the unrealistic side of Balzac may plunge him into the grotesque' by way, perhaps, of reaction against dulness and triviality. As to- descriptions, much has already been said. In general, they may be examined for long-windedness and for the relationship of parts. In particular, with reference to any person, one should notice how his dress, physiognomy, and very gestures give the clue to his personality. It is in this connection that the keynote in description may often be determined.6 Why is Vautrin repeatedly 1 Even when the game is hampered by technical documentation, says Lanson, "on croit que c'est arrive" (Hist. de la litt. frang, [8th ed.], p. 989). 2 Loc. cit.

Why does Old Grandet stammer ? What is the unifying feature of the detailed features of Marche-a- terre ? What significance has the name of a character ? In passing to furniture and the like, one might ask, by way of transition, if Balzac often vivifies inanimate things in the manner of Hugo, Daudet, or Dickens, by making them serve as symbols or monsters. Here is his own opinion of the value of setting: "L'animal a peu de mobilier, il n'a ni arts ni sciences, tandis que l'homme, par une loi qui est a rechercher, tend a representer ses mceurs, sa pensee et sa vie dans tout ce qu'il approprie a ses besoins."' This is the coquille idea: that the human animal leaves his imprint on his shell.2 Brunetiere doubts whether our way of dressing and our place of living are so universally linked with our manner of feeling.3 Yet he holds, somewhat contradictorily, that "les descrip- tions de Balzac ont toujours quelque raison d'etre en dehors d'elles- memes" (whereas poetic and romantic description was its own excuse for being)--"et cette raison ... .tant toujours explicative des causes qui ont fagonn6 dans le cours du temps les tres ou les lieux, les descriptions de Balzac, rien qu'A ce titre, sont done toujours historiques."4 That is, they will sometimes have a socio-historical rather than an immediately biographical value. Perhaps the house of the Clais, in the Recherche de l'absolu, would be a case in point. When it comes to a wider topography, the same question of linking still asserts itself. Why, in Les Chouans, do we have such a minute description of the Breton countryside? What is the use made generally of local color and historical background? The former, by the way, besides dealing with customs, takes on frequently a philological aspect. The description of conditions, status, etc., is supposed to be Balzac's forte. His novels are naturalistic, says Brunetibre, "en premier lieu par la diversit6 des conditions qu'ils mettent en scne."6 In this connection only, the critic justifies the novelist's emphasis of money, as gained in a diversity of practical ways. Hence the 1 (Euvres, I, 3. 2 Cf.

With reference to the kinds of description, it may be done en masse or en detail. In the former case, it should be noticed whether the whole thing is concentered (as above mentioned) for one purpose or from one viewpoint. It is good art, for instance, to take the special viewpoint of a fictional observer and to describe nothing that he would not see. Or the description may be done from an inanimate viewpoint, as when Flaubert notes only those things that lie in the path of a ray of light. Did Balzac so restrict himself ? It would be easier to find examples of his centering the description around a main idea, as in Une Passion dans le desert, where each touch added to the panther is in order to emphasize her resemblance to a woman. Incidentally, one should also observe the effect of repetitions and of resumes. It is of course multiplied detail that makes a description, and there are those who affirm that Balzac multiplies where he should subtract. "This extravagance is his great fault," says Henry James, "in spite, too, of its all being detail vivified and related, characteristic and constructive."' Where is it essentially related and where not, and what effect has mere multiplicity and size upon the reader ? Is it usually cumulative, and when it fails of this effect, is it because juxtaposition takes the place of coherence? At times there is certainly a plethora if not a mere juxtaposition of details in Balzac, and Brunetiere even indicates this as his second chief claim to be called naturalistic-" par l'abondance, la pr6cision et la minutie de ce genre de details."2 Where we do not recognize the necessity of this abundance, it may be due to our shortsightedness or it may be that Balzac is again possessed by the fetish of universality. He himself assures us that there was a reason for everything he did. "En saisissant bien le sens de cette composition, on recon- nattra que j'accorde aux faits constants, quotidiens ... aux actes de la vie individuelle, a leurs causes et A leurs principes, autant d'importance que jusqu'alors les historiens en ont attach6 aux 6vinements de la vie publique des nations."3 That leads us to speak 1 The Lesson of Balzac, p. 85. 2 Honor6 de Balzac, p. 143. s (Euvres, I, 12. 367</page><page sequence="18">88 E. PRESTON DARGAN of the causal detail, as I have called it, the detail which is truly a joint in the harness. "I1 voit avec les d6tails les lois qui les gou- vernent."' In Balzac's elaborate scaffoldings, one must evidently test the individual beams, for it is again a question of solidity. The characteristic detail is slightly different. It may be the crown of causes, it may be simply the salient or the summarizing feature by which we remember a person, a landscape, a season. Brunetibre chooses from Flaubert a number which precisely hit off a season or an hour.2 From Le Cousin Pons I may instance the dirty knocker to Fraisier's place of business and from Le Pare Goriot, in the direction of contrast, the statue of Cupid in the garden of the pension. With regard to persons, the characteristic detail often becomes simply a "gag," as in the case of Daudet's lazy actor, "who had not the right to renounce his art." The picturesque detail is sometimes one and the same with the foregoing, or it may exist primarily for its own vividness. For instance, it is a frequent touch in fiction, found both in Balzac and Flaubert, to have sunlight strike upon the weapons of a distant army, revealing it distinctly for that moment.3 The exact and technical kind of detail scarcely needs definition. Brunetiere notes that a number of this kind are brought in through money dealings.4 Maigron, in his book on the influence of Sir Walter Scott, observes that Balzac drew from that author "cette foule de d6tails pr6cis-les seuls caracteristiques "5-and then applied them to everyday life. Balzac's care for exactness in detail is well known. He and Stendhal were practically the first to set themselves a severe standard for the depiction of contemporary life with minute precision. Balzac's journeys in search of close local color, his zeal in seeking for the right house, the right street, the right name- witness the Z. Marcas story-often brought the right results. Sometimes it led him into insignificant, merely photographic or microscopic representation. Sometimes detail is really useless, 1 Taine, op. cit., p. 70. 2 Le Roman naturaliste, p. 168. 3 At the beginning of Les Chouans and of Salammb6. 4 Honor6 de Balzac, p. 140. 5 Maigron, Le Roman historique d l'6poque romantique, p. 230. 368</page><page sequence="19">STUDIES IN BALZAC 89 whether it is true or not; but occasionally also it gets its effect through being apparently unrelated. It may serve for contrast, it may serve simply to illustrate the indifference of things, as when Tess of the d'Urbervilles is attended, at a critical moment in her fortunes, by a piece of soiled paper blowing aimlessly about. As to style, I will briefly suggest the possibilities. It may have in different places any or several of the characteristics enumerated. If it is materialized to start with, that kind of style is likely to bring certain of the other qualities in its train. What Brunetiere indicates for another novelist may occur in Balzac. There may be something "lourdement sensuel" even in presumably idyllic parts, or the design may disappear "sous l'empatement des couleurs."1 In the heavy and involved passages, Balzac seems deliberately to thicken the medium through his desire to tell everything. There will be found Rabelaisian catalogues, exclamatory and rhetorical sentences, above all masses of technical expressions, for the use of the mot propre is considered one of Balzac's prominent traits. His style is adapted to all circumstances and is therefore by turns simple or forceful, pedantic or technical, sometimes '"artiste," sometimes neologic or smacking of what he called "la bricabracologie "-which term is itself a monstrous neologism. Taine calls this style a gigantic chaos and remarks what effects are attained by comparison (through analogy and figures) of the scientific with the sentimental world. For instance, he quotes a gorgeous passage in which love is expressed in terms of botany.2 Such figures as these are not infrequent, and one may recall how George Eliot's scientific interests worked in a similar direction. There is also the more usual class of simply natural figures, some- times employed with strict appropriateness: a farmer or a soldier will draw his comparisons from his own field. It would be worth while to observe whether Balzac makes much use of that inverted type of figure which expresses nature by comparisons with art. This is opposed to the Aristotelian tradition but is, I believe, fairly common in the nineteenth century. Does our author affect the Flaubertian kind of figure which Brunetiere defines as "la traduction 1 Le Roman naturaliste, p. 15. 2 Nouveaux essais, pp. 91-92. 369</page><page sequence="20">90 E. PRESTON DARGAN du sentiment par quelque sensation exactement correspondante."' Certainly, here as elsewhere, Balzac leans to exactness and vividness, and it will be desirable to pick out those figures which show most of these qualities. In criticizing dialogue, the question of naturalness and appro- priateness to each character should come first. What about Hulot's military slang and Rastignac's description of high life ? Is dialogue interspersed with description, for relief and illustration ? One may note the arrangement of single speeches between paragraphs of description; also speeches in chorus and "sliced dialogue." Henry James holds firmly. that dialogue, admirable for illustration, should not be used for constructive purposes, and he believes that Balzac followed this "law."2 On the contrary, we will find that Balzac frequently uses dialogue in order to narrate; and often it forwards the story in a dramatic way, because it is the way of the drama. In this introductory study, I have been occupied with stating problems according to the critics and the general probabilities. Subsequent studies will endeavor to solve or illustrate these problems, keeping mainly to the analysis of realism here given. E.
