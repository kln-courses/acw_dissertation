Elizabeth Janus on wood panel, 66 x 50.8cm paper, 170.2 x 61cm panel Cameron Jamie's art has been described as a form of 'backyard anthropology'.1 His attraction to quirky pageants, ceremonies, contests and other commemorative or group activities is transformed into multi-media performances, films, drawings and object installations that are fascinating visual records of what makes a given culture tick. Favouring certain aspects of lowbrow and popular culture, such as amateur and professional wrestling on the American West Coast or European Christmas traditions, he actively cultivates peculiar situations that are indicative of deeply rooted beliefs or the hierarchies and meanings of collective behaviour. Jamie, however, is no amateur social scientist doing fieldwork with the required clinical objectivity; nor does he mock or judge with any sense of superiority. In fact, one has the impression that he often identifies, or at least sympathises, with his subjects, willingly acting as a witness to and sometime instigator of the strange pantomimes that are as revealing about his own predilections as they are about the society from which they come. The notions of'distancing', exoticism, representation of the other, and difference are mflected, reworked, readjusted as a function of criteria no longer geographical or cultural but methodological and even epistemological in nature: to make foreign what appears familiar; to study the rituals and sacred sites of contemporary institutions with the minute attention of an 'exotic' ethnographer, and using his methods, to become observers observing those others who are ourselves ? and at the limit, this other who is oneself.. -Jeanjamin2 As an American living in France, Jamie already wears the mantle of outsider, one who is able to observe cultural specificities while remaining at a comfortable distance. His expatriate status also gives him a nuanced take on his own country, one that allows him to make unexpected and even paradoxical cross-cultural connections. For example, in a collection of studies, sketches and found materials (what he calls 'ephemera') for Spook House (2002) - a 25-minute film about a practice common in the Detroit area of constructing frightening lawn environments as part of Halloween festivities - Jamie has accumulated a plethora of visual materials and photographs (of vampires, jack-o-lanterns, ghosts, skeletons, witches) that document the holiday's origins in Europe as a pagan celebration, its evolution into a Christian/ete, its adoption and transformation into the popular American secular holiday known today and its exportation as a commercial venture back to Europe. Jamie sometimes seeks out relatively marginal cultural phenomena as fuel for his imagination. In fact, one might consider him to be someone who works in the interstices of fine- and folk-art traditions ? in this grey area between high and low unexpected, often incongruous connections can be made; put another way, Jamie stretches the boundaries distinguishing fine art from kitsch and tries to blur the differences between the artist and the anonymous craftsperson. For example, in a series of works from 2001 roughly 1 Ralph Rugoff, 'Backyard Anthropology', in G?nther Holler-Schuster (ed.), Cameron ?amie, Cologne and Graz: Hatje Cantz Verlag and Neue Galerie Graz am Landesmuseum Joanneum, 2006, pp.66?72. 2 Jean Jamin quoted in James Clifford, The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth- Century Ethnography,, Literature, and Art, Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 1988, pp.143?44.

In early December a group of young men dressed in Krampus costumes ? grotesque wooden masks and yeti-like furry suits ? walk through mountain villages terrorising locals. Like Halloween, the Krampus festival has its origins in pre-Christian Europe, but with time the Krampus ? part demon, part incubus ? and its evil magic were co-opted by the Church, introducing into the procession a counterpoise in the form of a white-bearded religious figure wearing a bishop's mitre meant to be Saint Nicholas (who eventually evolved into the secular Santa Claus, Saint Nick or Father Christmas that we know today). The large elaborate masks that they wear are impressive and terrifying, with deformed but intricately carved facial features and multiple horns and fangs. In their supposed apotropaic or ritualistic function, they recall the African, Asian, Native American and Oceanic masks and sculptures which inspired European artists in the early part of the twentieth century. But while his modernist predecessors looked to so-called 'primitive' cultures as a foil to European academicism, Jamie focuses his attention closer to home: the Eurocentric rituals and collective behav iour that have persisted despite the developed world's 'enlightened' status.

'Culture', having barely survived this post- War barrage, was now resolutely lower-case, a principle of relative order in which the sublime and the vulgar were treated as symbols of equal significance. ? James Clifford 3 Growing up in a Southern California working-class suburb during the 1970s and 80s ? decades that were marked by a 'correction' to the turbulently liberal 1960s, and then by the Ronald Reagan administration's 'voodoo economics' and its kowtowing to Christian extremists ? it is not surprising that some of Jamie's early forays into art centred around countercultural phenomena such as Goth culture, monster magazines, underground comic books and graphic novels and alternative music (he is an avid collector of all three). During the 1990s these interests, along with all types of wrestling in their theatricality and artifice, inspired his first artistic projects. In 1996, for example, he organised a series of clandestine wrestling matches, dressing up for them in a funky jumpsuit with a prosthetic bum and wearing a cheesy portrait mask designed by a Mexican artisan called Dr Sty. Ihe only remnants of these fights are the mask and a short videotape or film, which, according to professional wrestling conventions, look just as choreographed as they are improvised. In one battle ? titled 'The New Life' - Jamie's opponent is a Michael Jackson impersonator; their simulated, seemingly violent encounter in what appears to be someone's living room has a farcical edge that is part theatre of the absurd and part commedia dell'arte. What we mean by 'Art Brut' is works executed by those who are untouched by cultural art and for whom mimicry (in subject, choice of materials, execution, means of transposition, etc.) has... little or no importance; who instead draw inspiration from deep within themselves rather than from the cliches of classical or fashionable art. We are witness, then, to an artistic operation that is pure, raw, and reinvented at every step by the authentic impulses of its maker. ? Jean Dubuffet4 According to biographical accounts, Cameron Jamie intermittently attended California Institute of the Arts, an art school founded in the early 1960s by Walt Disney, between 1991 and 1994. During this time he grew averse to conventional art-school doctrine, preferring to seek out the art of the self-trained or the outsider. In one group of paintings on paper from 1993, Jamie has a comic-book illustrator called Sketch use his likeness 3 James Clifford, 'On Ethnographic Surrealism', The Predicament of Culture, op. cit., p.129. 4 Jean Dubuffet, L'Art brutprefere aux arts culturels, Paris: Galerie Rene Drouin, 1949.

Sketch depicts Jamie as an Arnold Schwarzenegger-like action 2007, ink on Arches hero whose hair and face bear an uncanny resemblance to Jamie's own, but whose paper, wood, glass, head is attached to an excessively muscular body wearing only brown briefs and boots 208 x 114cm (Self-Portrait with Muscles). In two other paintings from this series, Sketch initially imagines Jamie as a kind of Terminator (in My Skeleton Battle) intent on slaying a band of animated skeletons; later (in Curse of the Coconut Head), Sketch goes off on a wild riff making Jamie's character part of a chaotic melange of ghoulish figures, disembodied heads and fire sacrifices that are painted in fluorescent shades of yellow, green and red. Not surprisingly, these works resemble both in style and technique the exaggerated, fantastic images found in standard comic books ? an aesthetic that Jamie actively cultivates. From a conceptual viewpoint, the project is similar to two series by the West Coast Conceptual art pioneer John Baldessari (a professor at CalArts during the 1970s): Commissioned Paintings (1969), for which he commissioned various street artists to paint 'portraits' of his hand pointing to ordinary objects from snapshots, and Police Drawing(1971), for which he asked a police sketch artist to draw his likeness after a brief, impromptu appearance.5 My drawings are not drawings... - Antonin Artaud 6 Cameron Jamie's drawings fall roughly into three categories: sketches and studies for larger projects; ink drawings; and mixed media or paintings on paper. The sketches or preparatory drawings ? in watercolour, gouache and ink ? have a loose, gestural feel and often include writing (notes, lists, texts) as clues to Jamie's thought process. In the ink-based works he melds figurative and anthropomorphic elements with splashes and smears of black ink, or with an all-over scribbling and obsessive scrawling that seems both coherent and out of control. The paintings on paper generally quote or appropriate fragments from his films, performances or photographs and, like the ink drawings, when exhibited they are attached to huge boards that lean against the walls. Jamie, like Artaud, asks us to look beyond technical mastery and draughtsmanship, and to read in the materials, smudges, lines and strokes what is 'inside' or behind the impulse, which Artaud characterised as 'chiselled from the brain or from the hair of emotion'.7 For example, in an exhibition in Paris last fall dedicated to his drawings, he included works of varying sizes (from 32.5 by 25 centimetres to the more monumental 208 by 114 centimetres) with titles, in either French or English, which alternate between the enigmatic and the visceral. La Memoire interne, for example, or, Gutter Howl ? both from 2007 - have the formal gritty and hallucinatory strangeness typical of Surrealist games such as the exquisite corpse or the cathartic release of the unconscious found in automatic writing. Another, Little Eva (also from 2007), pairs a disturbing rendering of what looks like a baby's head with the oversized legs of a spider; the ensemble is surrounded by small orb-like shapes that resemble sperm and which are partially covered by thick black curlicues. For Cameron Jamie ideas and process are more important than the aesthetic merits of the final product. In making choices that go against the grain of artistic conventions, he prefers forms closer to caricature and the grotesque that collapse the space between naturalistic representation and the uncanny. The remnants of Jamie's actions, whether a mask, a film or a painting, function in a similar way to what psychoanalysis calls 'transitional objects'. They are images associated with contemporary rituals that act as intermediaries between psychic and external reality; thus, the magical quality long associated with image-making is given a fresh look and a new, updated context. 5 See Mike Kelley, 'Legend Tripping', in G.
