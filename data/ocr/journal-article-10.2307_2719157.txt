The brothers Ch'eng Hao WOR (1032-85) and Ch'eng I WM (1033-1107) innovated when they asserted that t'ien, destiny (ming ir), and the Confucian Way (tao A.) were actually no more than various names for principle. When other later Confu- cians-especially Chu Hsi *, (1130-1200)-followed the Ch'eng brothers' formulation, traditional Confucian thought based on t'ien was transformed into a more rational and metaphysical philosophy. This shift of the grounding of world view marked a watershed somewhat analogous to the one approximately fifteen centuries earlier when Confucius (551-479 B.C.) had largely transformed the anthropomorphic t'ien evident in pre-Confucian passages in the With joyful thanksgiving and grateful appreciation for his over three and a half decades of teaching at Harvard, I offer this article in celebration of the seventieth birthday and retire- ment of my principal mentor, Benjamin I.

In the case of Confucius, later scholars generally have empha- sized his comments about Mandate of Heaven (t'ien-ming i*) and his pronouncement that "t'ien does not speak yet all things thrive." Such passages did indeed serve as a basis within Confucianism for the later naturalistic conception in which t'ien was reduced to the depersonalized order of the natural world. However, other passages by the Master himself clearly indicate that he maintained some of the more theocentric notions about t'ien. For instance, Confucius claimed that only t'ien truly knew him and that t'ien had bestowed upon him the special mission of preserving the cultural tradition of antiquity that had been transmitted through the founders of the Chou dynasty.' Still, the new direction begun by Confucius was developed by Mencius (371-289 B.C.), who built upon the idea of t'ien as moral reality, and by Hsuin Tzu (fl. 298-238 B.C.), who picked up the im- plications of t'ien as naturalistic order from both Confucius and early Taoism. Mencius remarked that if one developed his mind he would know his nature, and if one knew his nature he would know t'ien, that is, the moral cosmic order.2 Hsiin Tzu conceived of t'ien as a depersonalized order of nature; thus, he could even argue that people should cease revering t 'ien and resolve to control it for human utility.3 Although few major Chinese thinkers of later times embraced Hsiin Tzu's reductionist idea of t'ien as merely the natural environment, the naturalistic conception of t'ien so greatly influenced later thinkers that modern scholars have tended to downplay vestiges of personality or consciousness in Confucian 1 Analects (Lun-y ) 6/26, 7/22, 9/5, 11/8, 14/37, and 17/19 on t'ien; 2/4 and 16/8 on t'ien-ming.

Has the watershed shift from t'ien to 1i enhanced a twentieth-century rationalistic penchant to assign less weight to Chu Hsi's notions of t'ien than his own statements would warrant? This modern penchant is to a considerable extent an appropriate recognition of the significance of 1i in Chu Hsi's philosophical system. As the natural and ethical factor of identity and relationship of all entities, 1i was present as a raison d 'tre in each entity, but also possessed a metaphysical unity transcending the particularity of in- dividuated entities. The concept of 1i and its matrix with other terms played the principal role in Chu Hsi's philosophy of mind (hsin bi). But was there a secondary role for earlier concepts of t'ien-even the notion of t'ien having personality or consciousness? Sung Confucians, especially Chu Hsi, no doubt did in general think of t 'ien in more rationalistic and naturalistic terms than almost all earlier Confucians; however, twentieth-century authorities on Sung Confucianism appear to have extended the process of ra- tionalization to the point of essentially denying or ignoring per- sonality or consciousness in t 'ien as conceived of by Chu Hsi. For in- stance, in denying any significance to the character t'ien in the term t'ien-hsin i{? (mind of Heaven), Mou Tsung-san ?2_ told me in 1971 that t 'ien-hsin simply meant hsin. However, even my respect for Professor Mou's erudition could not completely erase a question that has occasionally resurfaced in my mind: Why would Chu Hsi bother to use such a term? When, in my reading, I occasionally encountered authorities who seriously dealt with Chu Hsi's concept of t 'ien, they usually downplayed its philosophical significance. T'ang Chuin-i Kh$ has acknowledged that the founders of Sung Confucianism saw their ideas as being based upon t'ien, in contrast to the Buddhists who established theirs upon hsin; however, he was more interested in drawing attention to the fact that the Ch'eng brothers and Chu Hsi equated t'ien with 1i and tao.4 Ch'ien Mu 0 has acknowledged that Chu Hsi felt obliged to talk about t'ien as lord or master (especially when explaining certain passages from the Confucian Classics), but 4 T'ang Chuin-i, Che-hsiieh kai-lun YMN-iJA (An introduction to philosophy), 2 vols.

What, then, did Chu Hsi mean by t'ien? On occasion, he noted that the meaning of the term in classical writings included: the physical or azure sky, the ruling power or master (chu-ti 4A or chu- tsai 4:), and it (principle).8 These meanings would cover all of the major denotations of the term in Confucian literature except perhaps the ancient one oft 'ien as anthropomorphic deity.9 Of these 5 Ch'ien Mu, Chu Tzu hsin hsiieh-an *#TJiT* (A new scholarly account of Chu Hsi), 5 vols.

In responding to an earlier version of this paper, he clarified his view: any consciousness Chu Hsi ascribed to t'ien was highly abstract; thus, anthropomorphic as Kim understands the word was an inappropriate way to refer to Chu Hsi's concept of t'ien.</page><page sequence="5">T'IEN IN CHU HSI 35 meanings, the one of principle was philosophically the most domi- nant in Chu Hsi's system, as evident in his comment: "The reason t'ien is t'ien is simply principle. If t'ien did not have principle, it would not be t'ien."10 This is the aspect of Chu Hsi's discussion of t'ien that has rightly been the focus of twentieth-century accounts; here I will explore complementary aspects-more ancient ones ascribing consciousness or personality t t 'ien. A few of Chu Hsi's statements reflect some affinity with the an- cient sense of t 'ien as deity. In 1182, for instance, while serving as an official in what is now Chekiang, he engaged in the ancient practice of praying for rain to alleviate a drought. Reporting his situation, he remarked in a letter to Ch'en Liang 1W- (1143-94): "When I pray, I do not stop until I have brought all of my sincerity to bear . . . . " '1 On another occasion, he twice swore an oath that t 'ien should condemn him if his interpretation did not follow what Men- cius had implied in a particular passage.12 Oaths and prayers do not necessarily indicate any belief in t 'ien as deity.13 But they do suggest that caution should be exercised in asserting that Chu Hsi never used the word t'ien in its meaning of a deity. The mysterious power apparent in nature seemed to suggest to Chu Hsi that there was some sense in which t 'ien was a master or rul- ing power. T'ien as the azure heavens was so full of such power as to '1 Chu Hsi, Chu Tzuyii-lei *f (Classified conversations of Chu Hsi), compiled by Li Ching-te p,, 8 vols.

Chu Hsi (as far as I know) did not resort to the techniques of coercing the rain deities, which are discussed by Alvin P.

Chu Hsi answered: "Heaven itself. Heaven is an absolutely strong thing, yang, and therefore rotates without stop. There must be a master before it can do so. One must see such a thing for himself. It is not something that can be fully explained in words. "14 Because of various classical passages, especially in the Book of Documents and the Book of Changes (I ching H), Chu Hsi deduced that there was an indication of something "like a person acting as a ruling power.""5 Several passages portraying t'ien in a conferring role led him to state that the word "confer" (chiang %) conveyed the idea of a master or ruling power.16* Chu Hsi was reluctant to assert the absence of any master in the cosmic process, but he did not postulate the existence of a god act- ing as judge of mankind. He reasoned: "It is certainly improper to say that within t'ien is a person judging guilt and sin; however, to say that the tao completely lacks a lord is also improper."'"' On one occasion, he was asked about a passage in the Book of Documents which proclaimed that "t'ien sees as my people see and hears as my people hear." The question posed was, "Is t'ien here principle?" To which Chu Hsi replied: "If all is taken to be principle, how could one also say 'as my people sees and hears'? There is a sense here of a master.""8 This reply is noteworthy, for this passage could easily be interpreted in a more rationalistic way than Chu Hsi chose to do here. He could have followed Mencius (5A/5) and said that t'ien's apparent seeing and hearing was actually only the people's seeing and hearing-as demonstrated in an expression of the 14 Chu Tzuyii-lei, 5:68.2679 (tr. by Wing-tsit Chan in Reflections on Things at Hand: The Neo- Confucian Anthology [New York: Columbia University Press, 1967], p. 9). 15 Chu Tzuyii-lei 1:4.96-97; quoted in Chu Hsi, Chu Tzu ch'uian-shu k#j- (Complete works of Chu Hsi), (Yiian-chien chai * edition, 1713), 43.34a-b; cf.

For instance, Wang Fu IE T (85-163), writing in an essay on the fundamentals of government in which he employed the term t'ien-hsin, explained the term in a similar man- ner: " T'ien takes the people as its hsin; when the people are peaceful and happy, the t 'ien-hsin complies, but when the people appear anx- ious and bitter, the t'ien-hsin rebels. "9 Although Chu Hsi could have glossed the passage from the Book of Documents in a more naturalistic manner, as Wang Fu had done, Chu Hsi was not argu- ing for a conventional sense of deity. For instance, when asked about burning incense to t 'ien, he responded: " T'ien is simply within the self, so what is there to pray to?"20 Commenting upon a traditional story of how the "Emperor of Heaven" (t 'ien-ti k*) had talked to T'ang Kao-tsung (r. 649-683) in a dream, Chu Hsi re- marked: Today, people explain this Emperor of Heaven as a ruling master and say this emperor is without form; but I think this explanation is inadequate. I also consider it unacceptable to say, as is commonly done, that it is the Jade Emperor. In the final analysis, scholars are not able to answer the question of what this principle is.21 In light of Chu Hsi's general association of t'ien with principle, this passage-along with his comment on the passage from the Book of Documents cited above-is of particular importance. It was ap- parently difficult for him to explain to his own satisfaction, even in terms of principle, the personalized and transcending power that was conventionally and popularly associated with t'ien. Chu Hsi did on occasion discuss the relationship between the no- tion of a master or ruler and the concept of principle within the con- ception of t'ien. Things on earth were as they were by reason of principle and not by virtue of the existence of a master.22 Further- more, "the ruler was only principle acting as lord.' '23 One might say that there was difficulty inherent in such an effort to utilize the concept of principle to rationalize the idea of t 'ien as ruling power or '9 Wang Fu, Ch 'ien-fu lun M"==H (Discourses of the hidden master), (Peking: Chung-hua shu-chui, 1979), 2.88; or (SPPY ed.), 2.17a. 20 Chu Tzuyui-lei, 6:90.3635, Ch'ien Mu, 1:366. 21 Chu Tzuyu-lei, 6:79.3233, Ch'ien Mu, 1:370. 22 Chu Tzuyii-lei, 1:1. 7-8. 23 Chu Tzuyii-lei, 1:1.8.</page><page sequence="8">38 HOYT CLEVELAND TILLMAN master. Ch'ien Mu has reasoned that Chu Hsi posited a ruling power over the flux of ch 'i because principle itself did not have the capacity to govern ch'i; therefore, Chu Hsi equated principle and lord apparently to support the order of Confucian values and vir- tues. Although Ch'ien Mu portrays Chu Hsi as being troubled by the question of a master in t 'ien and as being reluctant to discuss the concept of t'ien as lord separately from principle, he concedes that Chu Hsi did speak of them separately in positing a ruling power that could not be adequately described in words. In spite of these difficulties in Chu Hsi's discussions of t 'ien, Ch'ien Mu emphasizes that the view of t'ien as master was an old one inherited from the Classics and the concept of t 'ien as principle was a new one and cen- tral to Chu Hsi's formal philosophy.24 Chu Hsi's reliance on the texts of the Confucian Classics meant that he had to use the concept t 'ien and explain the theocentric pen- chant of some of their passages. A great many of his comments on t'ien address such passages. Asked on one occasion if the term hsin had the same meaning as "ruler" (ti) in the Classics, Chu Hsi responded that the character for person (jen A) was similar to the character t 'ien X and the word hsin was like the word ti.25 Again com- menting upon classical texts, he said: [The decrees] simply flow from the great source. The phenomena may be such as would lead us to think that there is not really one imparting the decree; but that there is a person above us by whose command these things come to pass, seems to be taught by the Book of Poetry and the Book of Documents-in such passages, for ex- ample, as speak of the wrath of the supreme ruler. But still this ruler is none other than principle. In the whole universe there is nothing higher than principle and hence the term ruler.26 In evaluating such passages one should keep in mind and try to balance two considerations: first, Chu Hsi was commenting upon classical passages, and so in a sense the ideas and concepts were not his own; second, one should take care not to be reductionist and to detach Chu Hsi from concepts in repository texts of the Confucian tradition (except when he explicitly disassociates himself from them).

Works from the Han (206 B.C.-A.D. 220) and Wei- Chin (220-420) eras contain the term in a variety of meanings: the mind of the ruler in heaven; the mind of the Chinese emperor as Son of Heaven; and the center of the physical heavens.27 The "Hsien yu i te" 57t-# chapter of the Book of Documents does employ the term, but as an "ancient text" chapter, this is a later in- terpolation from the Han era.28 In contrast to his frequent use of the term t'ien in his commentaries on the Four Books PiY, Chu Hsi ap- parently never employed the term t'ien-hsin in his commentaries on the Analects, the Mencius, the Chung-yung (Doctrine of the Mean tP*), and the Ta-hsuieh (Great Learning tk). Indices to the commentaries by Goto Toshimizu &amp;OPM do not contain this term as an entry.29 Chu Hsi did utilize the term t'ien-hIsin, in several different senses, on a number of occasions. In at least four places in his wen-chi, Chu Hsi used the term to mean the mind of the reigning emperor. In one of these cases he was writing a memorial to the emperor, but two are in letters to officials and another is a preface to a collection of memorials by a prime minister.30 While commenting in the Yii-lei on one of Chang Tsai's essays about the mind, Chu Hsi utilized t 'ien-hsin-as Chang had done to mean the mind of Heaven. Chang Tsai had written: By enlarging one's mind, one can enter into all the things in the world. As long as anything is not yet entered into, there is still something outside the mind.

The sage, however, fully develops his nature and does not allow what is seen or heard to fetter his mind. He regards everything in the world to be his own self. This is why Mencius said that if one exerts his mind to the utmost, he can know nature and Heaven. Heaven is so vast that there is nothing outside of it. Therefore the mind that leaves something outside is not capable of uniting itself with the t 'ien- hsin. Knowledge coming from seeing and hearing is knowledge obtained through contact with things. It is not knowledge obtained through one's moral nature. Knowledge obtained through one's moral nature does not originate from seeing and hearing.31 Although Chu Hsi considered Chang's statement about enlarg- ing the mind to be overly imaginative, Chu Hsi approved of Chang's essay and glossed the phrase about entering into things to mean penetrating the principles of things. While elaborating on this passage, on at least two occasions he quoted with approval Chang's judgment that the mind that left anything outside could not be one with the t'ien-hsin. On one of the occasions, Chu Hsi concluded: "For t'ien is great and altruistic, embracing all things; when in my investigation of things there is one principle in them which eludes my search, my mind is egoistic and unlike the t'ien-hsin. "' In this context, t 'ien-hsin was a positive metaphor for unity with all things, as opposed to petty egocentric orientations. Although the term that Chang Tsai used had been employed by some Han and Wei-Chin thinkers in an anthropomorphic sense denoting the mind of the ruler in Heaven, Chang understood t'ien to be a metaphor for an abstract principle. T'ien was the "principle of spontaneity" for the way in which the processes of Heaven and Earth operate. As spontaneous process, there was no consciousness directing the process: "Heaven thus is without consciousness [hsin], without [purposive] action. There is nothing which directs it. It is forever thus. "33 Was Chu Hsi more open to accepting a con- sciousness in t'ien?

In commenting on a statement made by Ch'eng I, Chu Hsi remarked: "The statement 'the mind of com- miseration is the tao of life in man' means that we receive the mind of Heaven and thereby live. To give birth to things is the mind of Heaven."34 Here Chu Hsi associates t 'ien chih hssin with the positive, life-giving force in nature; furthermore, he interjects the mind of Heaven into the discussion without being led to it by a passage on which he was commenting. On another occasion, Chu Hsi explicitly identifies t'ien chih hsiin with the power that controlled principle: The mandate of Heaven (t'ien-ming Tp) pervades all things; the agent by which these principles are controlled (suo-i chu tsai kuan-she shih 1i che f is the mind of Heaven (t'ien chih hsin); that which possesses these principles is the nature of Heaven, as, for example, the principle which produces the four seasons; and those influences which are put forth and nourish all things are the feelings of Heaven.35 It is striking that Chu Hsi went this far in speaking of t'ien chih hsin as distinct from, and director of, principle. The context here, as with the one above, is the life-giving force in nature. This concern for the life-giving force in nature and its relation to a consciousness in t 'ien led Chu Hsi to consider the consequences of two different worldly situations: one where t'ien-ti yu hsin iIhiL? (Heaven and Earth had consciousness) and the other where t'ien-ti wu hsin (Heaven and Earth were without deliberate intention). If t 'ien-ti wu hsin prevailed, Chu Hsi speculated, unnatural phenomena might occur, such as oxen giving birth to horses or peach trees producing plum blossoms. There were other situations where t'ien-ti wu hsin apparently functioned without adverse effect, such as when the seasons were regular and things were generated as spontaneously determined.36 On other occasions, however, when an incipient act was needed for generation, t'ien-tiyu hsin: "When the myriad things are born and grow, that is the time when Heaven and Earth have no mind. When dried and withered things desire life, that is the time when Heaven and Earth have mind. "37 In either 34 Chu Tzuyui-lei 6:95.3874 and Chu Tzu ch'iian-shu 44.14a (cf. tr.

However, we should be careful not to exaggerate the consciousnesses ascribed to t'ien in such in- stances. For example, in another passage, Chu explained that t'ien- ti did not actually plan to produce a sage. The birth of a sage was simply a natural process of a quantum of ch 'i coalescing; yet, when the rare occurrence of the birth of a sage did occur, "it appeared as though tI'en had an intention about it."38 Philosophically the most interesting instance of Chu Hsi's use of the term t'ien-hsin is its equivalence with tao-hsIin jl?b (the moral mind or mind in accord with tao): Let the mind go, so that it may be broad and tranquil, and it will be enlarged. Do not let it be prepossessed by the divisive influence of selfish thought, and it will be enlarged. With the mind enlarged it naturally follows that there will be no hastiness; if we meet with calamity there will be no fear; if we meet with prosperity there will be no exultation; for in a very little while calamity may give place to pros- perity, and prosperity to calamity. Hsun Tzu said, "The Chun-tzu -T# (person of integrity or noble man) with a mind enlarged will be one with t'ien and in accord with tao. If his mind is small he will be inspired by awe and righteousness and be self-controlled." For with the person of integrity, when his mind is enlarged it is the t'ien-hsin, when it is small it is the watchful and reverent mind of King Wen of Chou, and both are good. With the ignoble man, if his mind is enlarged it will be reckless, if it be small it will be petty and narrow, selfish and miserly, and both are bad.39 In a general sense, Chu Hsi could be seen here as commenting in- directly upon Chang Tsai's passage about enlarging the mind and therefore utilizing the term t 'ien-hsin as Chang had earlier done, but there is no real need to make that connection in this instance. One could argue almost as effectively for Mencius's statement that know- ing one's mind would lead to knowing one's nature and then to knowing t'ien. In any case, it was Hsiin Tzu whom Chu Hsi chose to quote here. This is noteworthy because modern scholars have demonstrated that the passage in the Book of Documents-upon which Chu Hsi's philosophical discourse on tao-hsin was founded-was ac- 38 Chu Tzuyii-lei 1:4.129, Ch'ien Mu, 1:374. 39 Chu Tzuyii-lei 6:95.3887, Chu Tzu ch'uian-shu 44.14b (cf. tr.

Shun reportedly described the "human mind" (jen-hsin A,L) as "precariously unstable" and the tao-hsin as "subtle and obscure" or "only a spark." This passage was in -one of the ancient text chapters, about whose authenticity Chu Hsi expressed doubts, but his doubts did not hinder him from using its meaning for philosophical discourse.4" The tao-hsin was the "moral mind" or "ontological mind," the ethical perfection a person's mind could achieve through a process of moral cultivation and learning. The ontological substance of the moral mind was qualitatively distinct from the existential function- ing of the so-called "human mind" (jen-hsin) that was conditioned by the "self-centeredness of the material being. "42 This qualitative distinction should not be understood as implying the actual ex- istence of two minds. In a discussion of ethics, the heuristic dichotomy between tao-hsin and jen-hsin provided terms for discriminating ethical conditions of a person's actual mind; thus, tao-hsin and jen-hsin were metaphors and not real divisions of an individual's mind. When the mind manifested itself in total accord with moral principles, it was purely good and understood as tao-hIsin. The jen-hsin operated existentially within the world conditioned by egocentricity: the individual's sense of self-centeredness, material needs, and human desires. Theoretically, the jen-hsin in itself was neutral in an ethical sense. Its instincts and natural desires could be educated and cultivated to con- form to the ethical norms of tao-hsin or its feelings could surge unrestrained and pursue selfish passions.

In a sense, then, there were three qualitative levels of mind: those of the tao, the ordinary human, and the beast. The human mind so easily became conditioned by consciousness of the individual self and desires (yui 0) that it commonly departed from the moral path of tao-hsin. Given the contrast between the ease with which the jen-hsin drifted into evil and the absolute goodness of the tao-hsin, the moral task (as Chu Hsi conceived it) was to transformjen-hsin into tao-hsin. Although Chu Hsi discussed the con- cept of tao-hsin in a number of places, it was in his commentary on the Doctrine of the Mean (Chung-yung chang-chui iptwi) that he elevated it to a focal point of his philosophy. Hence, Chu Hsi discussed ethical questions in relation to his philosophy of mind largely in terms of a heuristic dichotomy of tao-hsin and jen-hsin and built upon Ch'eng I's identification of tao-hsin with heavenly princi- ple (t'ien-li )i3W) and jen-hsin with unrestrained desires.43 Given the assertion that the tao-hsin was "only a spark," there was inherent within the metaphor a warning about the difficulty of moral cultivation. Chu Hsi's concern over the difficulty of moral cultivation was related to his awareness of human failings. His faith in the Confucian doctrine of the goodness of human nature did not eliminate his sense of the reality of human fallibility. Indeed, human desires could overpower the goodness of the innate nature and drive one to commit evil acts-even though one knew that what one was doing violated the original goodness of one's own being. For instance, he spoke of an extreme case: Human nature is universally good. Even Chieh M and Chou ei [the rulers with whose reigns the ancient Hsia and Shang dynasties came to an end], who ex- hausted the possibilities of violence and went to the utmost extreme of wickedness, still knew that their actions were evil.

It is simply that human desires overpower [their inner natures].44 Explicating the thought of later Confucian thinkers, T'ang Chuin-i referred to an awareness of a problematic limit in one's "moral career" when one realized that one had "no guarantee of not-doing-any-evil-again. "45 Although Chu Hsi had a keen awareness of the reality of human failings, he also made optimistic assertions about the spontaneity and certainty of right behavior. The passages cited above concern- ing human failings should be balanced against ones which proclaim confidence in the ultimate spontaneity of morally correct action. For example, he instructed his students: "We must investigate the principle of things to the utmost. Then we can see the right and wrong clearly. If a thing is right, we will do it, and if evil, we will not."46 In another conversation, he elaborated: But you must be continually watchful, and make the principle which is in you such that action is certain to be in accordance with it. For example . . . in serving my parents I cannot be other than filial, in serving my sovereign I cannot be other than faithful, and this spontaneously "without waiting for special preparation." . . . When virtue is perfected in me, it is as though there were in me a man who of necessity is filial and fraternal, loyal and faithful, and would not in any wise do anything that is not filial and fraternal, loyal and faithful. It is something like the Taoist idea of nurturing a child into existence within one. Everything pertaining to human desire, this man will in no wise consent to let me do.47 It is noteworthy here that Chu Hsi felt comfortable borrowing Taoist imagery of nurturing a child within oneself who would develop to the point of serving as a governor or limiter of one's ac- tion. This imagery of nourishing within oneself a person who would provide natural restraint on one's behavior is compatible with that of cultivating the tao-hsin to control the egocentric bent of the jen- 44 Chu Tzuyii-lei 4.59:2181-82, Chu Tzu ch'uan-shu 42.9a-b, (cf. tr.

In both cases, Chu Hsi expresses himself in a metaphor that addresses the reality of human fallibility and the quest for con- fidence in one's effort to be ethical. The Mencian faith-which Chu Hsi also proclaimed-in the original goodness of human nature was the fundamental ground for answering why and how one should be ethical. The centrality of that doctrine should not, however, keep us from noticing the other concepts that Chu Hsi developed to deal with this perennial quest for confidence in what T'ang Chiin-i called one's "moral career." Some of these supplemental con- cepts-particularly that of principle, the life force in the virtue of humanity (jen i), the philosophy of mind, including the tao-hsin- have received considerable attention in contemporary scholarly literature. For instance, in explicating the general problem of the tension between the goodness of principle or nature and the ten- dency toward evil of actual, physical entities, Wing-tsit Chan has noted that there is a "self-correcting mechanism" traceable to the Doctrine of the Mean that the nature in the self and the nature in the universe are one and the same. This is the Confucian idea of t 'ienjen ho i TJAft-. The Ch'eng brothers and Chu Hsi emphasized this idea, especially as it was reinforced by the proclamation in the Book of Changes that the " great value of the universe is life (or, giving life). "48 But the issue of t 'ien and the mind of Heaven in relation to other con- cepts could be explored as a supplemental, but significant, notion. This would also serve to return to the question in the introduction about why Chu Hsi might bother to use a term like t 'ien-hsin or to in- clude some remnants of earlier notions of t 'ien as having some kind of consciousness. There is a parallel between the tao-hsin and the t'ien-hsin that would suggest that these metaphors addressed the problem of the grounds for confidence in one's struggle to be ethical. Just as in the individual person there were ethical problems because the jen-hsin 48 Wing-tsit Chan's comments at the conference on Neo-Confucianism in Korea held in Italy, August 3-7, 1981, as reported by Irene Bloom for the Columbia Seminar on Neo- Confucian Studies, September 1981, pp. 46-47. His statements made on that occasion reflected points made in his "The Evolution of the Confucian Concept ofJ8n, " Philosophy East and West, 4.4 (1955): 295-319, as well as his "The Neo-Confucian Solution to the Problem of Evil," CYYY 28 (1959): 773-91 which is reprinted in Charles K.H. Chen, comp., Neo- Confucianism, Etc.: Essays by Wing-tsit Chan (Hanover, N.H.: Oriental Society, 1969).</page><page sequence="17">T'IEN IN CHU HSI 47 could act as its own master, t 'ien at least theoretically had a potential for thought or action that might violate ethical principles because consciousness generally implies self-awareness and ability to make self-regarding choices. Such a theoretical possibility was negated by Chu Hsi's denying t'ien any self-interested intention or calculation (ssu-lui V,i) and having it routinely conform to principle.49 It was such self-regarding calculation that often served as the catalyst for individuals to depart from the ethical path. The action and con- sciousness of t'ien were routinely ethical; hence, ti'en was in har- mony and spontaneous conformity with principle. Such routine con- formity of t 'ien with ethical norms could be characterized as "bound consciousness'" -t'ien was bound to be in accord with the tao.50 Just as t'ien was always spontaneously in accord with principle, tao-hsin naturally followed principle and responded appropriately to each situation. As seen above, Chu Hsi asserted that when the mind of the person of integrity (chuin-tzu) was expanded, it was ti'en-hsin. Since the mind of the person of integrity would embody the tao-hsin, there is a rather explicit linkage between tao-hsin and t 'ien-hsin. Since the mind of t 'ien did not engage in egoistic calculation, linking tao- hsin to t 'ien-hsin was a trope for emphasizing the ideal of overcoming self-interested calculation; moreover, because the tao-hsin was good by definition, it might also be characterized as "bound con- sciousness. " In short, it would appear that these two metaphors for spontaneous conformity with ethical norms served to provide some supplemental ground for confidence that one could cultivate oneself to the point of transcending self-regarding calculation in order to achieve harmony with what was right. The further linkage to t'ien and the parallel to the mind of t'ien would augment this confidence because of the Confucian belief that the natural order of the cosmos was inherently moral. As Ch'ien Mu has observed, to support such traditional Confu- cian linkages between human ethics and cosmic or natural pro- cesses, Chu Hsi apparently needed to posit t'ien as having some characteristics which made it a master over principle. If cosmic pro- cesses were totally naturalistic and without conscious intent (wu- 49 Chu Tzu yu-lei 1: 1. 4, 5. 50 I am indebted to Benjamin I. Schwartz for the term "bound consciousness" in regard to t 'ien.</page><page sequence="18">48 HOYT CLEVELAND TILLMAN hsin), traditional Confucian grounds for such linkages would be weakened. Ch'ien Mu reasoned that Chu Hsi posited a ruling power over the flux of ch 'i because principle itself did not have the capacity to govern ch 'i. In light of this incapacity of principle itself to govern, Chu Hsi apparently equated principle with lord to sup- port the order of Confucian virtues upon which relationships in family, society and polity were founded. (There would appear to be considerable difficulty or even contradiction inherent in Chu's effort to speak both of t'ien being master and of principle itself being master.) Although Ch'ien Mu portrays Chu Hsi as being troubled by the question of a master in t 'ien and as being reluctant to discuss the concept of t'ien as being separate from principle, he concedes that Chu Hsi did speak of them separately in positing a ruling power which could not be adequately described in words.5" Our discussion on the "bound consciousness" evident in ti'en, t'ien-hsin, and t 'ien chih hsin provides a considerable textual base for perceiving what Chu Hsi meant in speaking of principle or t 'ien as lord or direc- tor. Such consciousness ascribed to t 'ien complemented the naturalistic conception of t'ien specifically in augmenting a sense that the flux of ch 'i was ultimately governed by a patterned, ethical order. Such flux of ch 'i could conceivably have resulted in oxen giv- ing birth to horses or peach trees having plum blossoms, Chu Hsi speculated, in the absence of consciousness in Heaven and Earth. The aspect of a transcendent, but moral, consciousness in t'ien together with the inability of principle to rule by directing its object should qualify or modify our characterization of principle as having its own direction. Principle does indeed have a direction, one toward life-giving, and that direction involved further linkage with t'ien. Here, the primary roots in classical sources were the naturalistic element evi- dent in the concept of the mind of Heaven and Earth (ti'en-ti chih hsin W*4L) from the Book of Changes and the attribution (made in classics like the Doctrine of the Mean) of natural life-giving processes to Heaven and Earth.52 As the opening sentence of the latter text also 51 Ch'ien Mu, especially 1:43-44, 55-60, 369-71. 52 The I ching or Book of Changes, the Richard Wilhelm translation rendered into English by Cary F. Baynes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1967), p. 505.

A little later in the text, Mencius (7B/ 16) is quoted as identifying the defining characteristic of man to be humanity (jen); the text further admonishes that if one "wished to know man, he must not fail to know t 'ien. " The pattern here is to associate the character of man's nature with jen and with what was endowed by the Mandate of Heaven. The character of the mind of Heaven and Earth as seen in their naturalistic processes is to transform and nourish the myriad things; moreover, if man cultivates himself, he can participate in these processes. The Ch'eng brothers and Chu Hsi adopted these cardinal con- cepts and elaborated upon them as key concepts in their philosophical systems. For instance, in his "Treatise on Humani- ty" (Jen-shuo), Chu Hsi drew upon the identification of t'ien-ti chih hsin with life-giving production to assert that man receives this mind of Heaven and Earth as his mind.53 Building from this endow- ment, the individual may attain the full exercise of the virtue (jen) in life nourishing, for this capacity is inherent in humanity itself because jen also means seeds, to produce, and to grow. These naturalistic and ethical concepts and terms are pervasive and cen- tral to Chu Hsi's philosophy. With these more naturalistic concepts at hand for explaining the life-giving force in nature, why would Chu Hsi on a few occasions interject far less naturalistic terms, such as t'ien-hsin, t'ien-tiyu hsin and t'ien chih hsin, into this discussion? Although a full answer to such a question would necessitate too much speculation, two obser- vations might be offered. First, the important role of dynamic life- giving in t'ien is not inherent in principle itself, for principle is not dynamic and does not create. T'ien was traditionally associated with dynamic life-giving and organismic union of people with the moral and life-giving order of the cosmos; hence, these qualities could be seen as relevant in positing a "self-correcting mechanism" to bridge the ethical breach that so easily occurred in actual, in- dividuated entities. It is such characteristics of t'ien that return us to terms like t 'ien-hsin, for the mind of t 'ien was both consciously in- volved in life-giving and bound to follow the tao. 53 Chu Tzu wen-chi 8:67.20a-21b (tr. Wing-tsit Chan, Source Book, pp. 593-97).</page><page sequence="20">50 HOYT CLEVELAND TILLMAN Second, the present exploration of Chu Hsi's use of these terms has opened the way to seeing new correlations in his thought. His discourse on the terms was made in the contexts of celebrating the life-giving force and searching for confidence in one's efforts toward ethical perfection in the face of an awareness of human fallibility. Celebration of the life-giving force in t'ien could also be seen as another supplemental ground for hope in the efficacy of one's moral cultivation, for it implied that nature in the self and nature in the cosmos were ultimately one and the same. Our discussion of these terms in these contexts has yielded a correlation between the mind of t'ien and tao-hsin as metaphors for "bound consciousness" that both provide models for hope in one's "moral career" and suggest the direction of consciousness is toward the principle of life-giving, the virtue of humanity. This correlation should enrich our understanding of the correlations between t'ien-ti chih hsin, jen, and life-giving, the mandate of t'ien, and tao-hsin. Although the number of occurrences of terms like t'ien-hsin and ti'en chih hsin are com- paratively quite small, they illuminate ramifications of the notion of t'ien in Chu Hsi's writings and linkages among his major concepts.</page></plain_text>
