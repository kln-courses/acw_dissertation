<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW Corban Walker CITY ARTS CENTRE, DUBLIN April-May 1994 Corban Walker's first solo exhibition Latitude is a self-portrait which focuses on the marginalisation of people with disabilities. Lat itude not only presents a representation of his relationship with the public and private environment but also underlines the social struc ture of ignorance, issues of disability and accepted notions of bio physics, mimetics and ergonomics. The exhibition is composed of six sculptures, a number of framed drawings and a site specific installation entitled Latitude. Using mate rials used in the construction industsry (wire, stone, slate, metal, wood, glass) the work incorporates these elements within its mode of production. Structurally and aesthetically the work inclines to wards minimalism, but directs an alternative discourse of self repre sentation. It is in this discourse that the work offers a discomforting analysis. Minimal art as Michael Fried recognised 'depends on the beholder [and] is incomplete without him . Therefore it is not through formal analysis of internal relationships, but through the experience of the spectacle that the meaning of the work is discovered. The spectator must confront and respond to non-exhibited features such as 'pres ence', scale and architectural implications. Fried admonished mini malism for what he called a 'latent anthropomorphism . Although much of minimal art escapes mimetics in relation to the figure in terms of shape or orientation it can be justifiably called anthropomorphic through its qualities of symmetry, hollowness and ultimately 'size'. Fried pointed out that much of minimal art approximates to average human size ie between four and seven feet high and anthropomor phism is associated by signalling the existence of 'presence' or 'ab sence' of the implied human figure. In Latitude, Walker both considers and directs his discourse to wards the spectator who is placed upon this accepted average height scale. The work accounts his relationship with the space, between four feet and six feet, and within the work's structure this is signified by an absence of awareness, acknowledgement and understanding. Void is a vertical construct with a system of equally spaced hori zontal sheets of glass. The piece stands at six feet high with a nega tive space of between four and six feet. There is no connecting point between this space, as there is none between each sheet of glass; this signifies a lack of discourse between Walker and the per son of average stance. The strongest piece in the show Latitude offers the antithesis to Void. Consisting of a number of metal wires strung around the gallery room in a floating grid; this fence like construct creates a uniformed restriction of access which is discreetly threat ening and potentially dangerous. The negative space is given greater importance than the positive structure itself. The piece is aptly titled, Latitude meaning both angular distance and a tolerated variety of ac tion, opinion or a (permitted) freedom of choice or action. Latitude signals the difficulties involved in the relationship between the dis abled person, latitude, and the domestic and public space. It inverts the social structural position by forming a threatening, seemingly transparent barrier which the viewer must navigate around and under, therefore inhibiting their access. The dichotomy between the resulting simplicity of the piece and the obvious complications in volved in its fabrication emphasises further the inherent positional differences and the unacknowledged difficulty which accompanies it. Within this exhibition, Walker is always aware of the proportional relationship with external scale, the relationship of the size of the object to the size of the spectator (as well as to himself), and the di rect environment. An awareness of scale is a function of the physical comparison between one's body size and the object. As Carl Andre explained, 'in sculpture there's quite a concrete relationship between one's size as a person, and/or mass as a person and the mass of sculpture ... And we are just absolutely conditioned by the sizes of our bodies and our own pretensions to measure things off, especially material things in the world, by our own size.' Latitude accepts this idea, but also highlights that an awareness of one's ergonomics can extend to an ignorance of anoth Corban Walker ^^K^K^K^K^K^K^K^K^K^K^K^K^K&amp;w?KflKflKMKMKKKjK^ 5 6 CIRCA</page><page sequence="2">er's. In Prejudice, a rectangular block of limestone five feet high has a piece removed from its top corner implying a 'chip on the shoulder, perhaps the spectator's or perhaps the artist's, as the sculpted mass al ludes to the potential average-sized model, figure, icon, idol or hero, which may be formed from the stone structure. Walker constantly defines and redefines his differences through a dialectic dialogue with the archetypal norm. In Peripheral Centre, the ideal male form is confronted by challenging da Vinci's golden-section in which the penis marks the centre of the male body and around which the body is seen to be mathematically proportioned. Walker relates a similar measuring system to his own body. A long seat-like structure mar cates the position of his own penis and suggests the distant position which is taken towards the sexuality of people with disabilities. Latitude forces the spectator to question their prejudices, but where it sometimes fails is in its uneasy appropriation of the mini malist form. An unawareness of Walker's empirical position leaves some of the objects and the drawings dangling within the critical realm of minimal art. A critique of solipsism, composition or the aesthetic form is less interesting and somewhat redundant in relation to the importance of Walker's invoked dialogue. Independently some of the works do not escape this criticism, but collectively Lati tude succeeds in recognising this difficulty and whilst opening draw ers to his world, Walker achieves in demanding a requestioning of our boundaries of perception and extends this debate in an informa tive and challenging way.
