What we see as verism or imitation in the repre- sentation of animals, plants, and humans, delights the uninitiated and lures the student into attempting to understand the seemingly straightforward meanings of the images. Mimetic art of the kind done by Moche is rare in pre-Columbian America and perhaps unique in the Andes (Pasztory 1998). Mimesis is a quality often associated with the well- known Moche ceramic portrait vessels (see Donnan, this volume). In this essay, however, I consider Moche architectural art, and how it differs from its predecessors. Grouped under the rubric of public art, the corpus in question encompasses architectural complexes and associated sculpture. Public here refers to groups of people, large or small, who view art outside their own domestic con- texts, often viewing such art as members of a group rather than as individuals. The advan- tage of discussing public art is that it offers rich interpretive opportunities. As many portable art objects were looted, their original contexts are unknown. Architecture, on the whole, however, is found in its original con- text, where it was intended by its creators to be viewed. This provides the opportunity to consider how people experienced the settings and perceived the art as part of a complex whole of images, architectural constraints, and movement through space (see Moore 1996). Public art also tends to be more pro- grammatic than portable art, giving us a better understanding of the interests of the domi- nant groups behind the creation of the works. The public art I discuss in this essay was made on the walls of buildings interpreted as temple complexes. The majority of public art in the Andes is architectural. Freestanding sculpture and other kinds of public art were not erected to the same degree as elsewhere in the ancient Americas. Examining this art and its evolution may contribute to understand- ing the changing roles of these architectural complexes and the political and ideological systems that were used to erect and maintain such elaborate buildings, plazas, and court- yards, as well as informing us about the art itself. In this paper I first review our current knowledge of public art in the Preceramic and Initial periods and in the Chavin Horizon period. Moche art will then be examined in regard to the way it broke with its immediate predecessor, Chavin, renewing some earlier conventions while at the same time broad- casting a very different social message. Moche artisans also introduced entirely new conventions, such as an emphasis on narra- tive. Essential to this is the Moche interest in mimesis. Broadly speaking, Moche art appears to be more accessible to viewers than the earlier art style, yet it conveyed perhaps a harsher message of social inequality. 21</page><page sequence="3">Public Art before Moche - the Terminal Preceramic Period Only in the Late Preceramic period does architecture appear that suggests a public sphere with a separate existence from a pri- vate one (Quilter 1991 ). That is to say, prior to about 1800 b.c., social formations were probably based on kinship links, and there were no sharp distinctions between private and public realms of human behavior. The sunken or enclosed circular chamber with central fireplace of the Kotosh Religious Tradition (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1985, 1986) partakes of ideas that probably stretch back to the Paleolithic campfire (fig. 1). The benches that often encircle these chambers leave little room for hierarchy, as all those seated are equidistant from the sacred hearth. These small, kiva-like structures of the Ter- minal Preceramic period (c. 1800-1600/1500 b.c.), continuing into the Initial period (c. 1600/1500-600 b.c.), were designed to hold several people, but the walls were generally unadorned. Other sites, such as Bandurria (Fung Pineda 1988: 77-78) were arranged with central standing stones or other devices to organize people in ceremonial activities, often in a circular arrangement. Little architectural ornament survives, if indeed it ever existed, at these early sites. At Kotosh itself, the reliefs flanking the entrance to a ceremonial chamber are among the earli- est public art in the Andes (Izumi and Terada 1972). The reliefs consist of two pairs of molded arms, one right-over-left, the other with arms reversed. Their location under niches suggests they may have related to fig- ures placed in the spaces above. Frédéric Engel (1967,- see Quilter 1985) noted traces of red and black pigment on the exterior wall plaster of Unit I, El Paraíso, but not enough remained to infer design motifs. While El Paraíso is technically a Preceramic site, it marks the beginning of the tradition of U-shaped ceremonial complexes on the Peru- vian central coast that survived into the suc- ceeding Initial period. It is from that era that public art and architecture begin to be found in quantity. Rectilinear platforms and sunken circular courts are the building blocks of public archi- tecture in the Late Preceramic and Early In- itial periods. As Michael Moseley (1992: 110) i .

Reconstruction of stairway with "mouth-band" frieze in the central atrium, Cardal After Burger 1992: 67, fig. 52 notes, solid platform mounds reflect the basic notion that elevation confers status and segregates extraordinary from ordinary space. In contrast, the circular, sunken courtyard evokes sentiments of inclusion. These spaces suggest a shared, egalitarian community. Often the builders of terrace and platform complexes incorporated circular courts within their overall plans, for example at Salinas de Chao (Alva 1986) and Cardal (Burger 1987). This combination suggests attempts to in- clude egalitarian principles within emerging hierarchical architectural and social struc- tures. Richard Burger (1987) proposes that the numerous sunken chambers on one of the "arms" of the U-shaped structure at Cardal may have been for rites of particular social groups, held under the general auspices of the Cardal complex and its managers. Late Preceramic and Early Initial period building complexes thus seem to express somewhat contradictory principles: hierarchy and rank versus egalitarianism. Over time, the upward-reaching platform constructions came to dominate Andean architecture for the rest of prehistory. Subterranean cham- bers, however, maintained a highly sacred role in many places, often holding the ulti- mate religious mysteries. The Initial Period Initial period architectural complexes mani- fest more public art than Preceramic sites.1 As with other periods and areas in Peru, the data set is contingent on factors of preserva- tion and the extent to which large sections of buildings have been cleared. Richard Burger (1992) has provided a systematic review of Initial period sites investigated. There are regionally consistent patterns of construction and design for Initial period civic-ceremonial centers, of which the best understood is that followed on the central coast. Following the work of Carlos Williams ( 1 97 1, 1980, 1985), Burger notes the consistent use of U-shaped architectural complexes in the valleys north and south of modern Lima (1992: 60-61). This pattern, combined with a suite of other traits, is so consistent along the central coast of Peru, stretching from the Lurin Valley to the Chancay Valley (and possibly Pativilca), that Burger and Salazar-Burger (1999) recently pro- posed that the culture it typifies should be referred to as the Manchay culture. Manchay culture architectural complexes are laid out in a U-shaped plan. Usually, one arm of the U is shorter. At Cardal, the com- plex that has been studied in most detail, a road extended through the central axis of the U, leading to a staircase on the central mound. The central mound and its flanking mounds went through a number of rebuilding stages. The succeeding building phases en- tombed the earlier structures as they grew larger. As noted above, Cardal architecture included both sunken circular courts and plat- form mounds. Access to the central mound was probably restricted to a few people, while ceremonies for larger groups were held in the plaza area. The general pattern of U-shaped architec- ture, accretional growth of mounds, and the use of painted wall friezes as public art holds throughout the Manchay culture area. Details of this public art, however, are only available for Cardal and Garagay, although Burger (personal communication) reports evi- dence of a frieze at Manchay Bajo. The evidence of public art at Cardal is in the penultimate atrium built at the top of the stairs on the central mound and dating to about 1 100 b.c. Renovated up to six times using different colors, the last version of the low-relief clay frieze was painted with red and yellow pigment, and depicts a huge mouth band with interlocking teeth and large fangs (fig. 2). Anyone entering the chamber beyond the atrium would have passed through the mouth of this ferocious deity. Presumably, entry into the mouth was a symbolic death, and those who reemerged from the temple had undergone a rite of passage, reborn in a new social and symbolic state.

The most extensive remains of Manchay public art were found at Garagay, in the lower Rimac Valley (Ravines and Isbell 1975), a site now surrounded by modern Lima. Structure B, the central mound at the apex of the U- shaped complex, follows the pattern of a cen- tral stairway leading to an atrium. The most recent atrium was destroyed, but an older one, known as the Middle Temple, was orna- mented with polychrome low-relief friezes (fig. 3). These show monstrous supernaturais, rendered in profile, facing towards stairs. The imagery includes an anthropomorphic fanged head and a zoomorphic form that combines spider and possibly feline attributes. These figures are framed by large, repeating step- design elements, similar to a profile view of one of the altars found in the summit build- ing at Cardal (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1991: 280), with a featherlike design above it. Burger (1992: 68) found a variant of this motif at Cardal, which suggests that this symbol- ism was widespread in Manchay culture.2 On Mound A, the smaller arm of the Gara- gay U, parts of two reliefs were found, placed as if to guard the entrance to an atrium (fig. 4). 3 They appear to represent warriors or war- riorlike supernaturais, as indicated by the presence of circular shields. Similar imagery has been found on petroglyphs at Alto de las Guitarras in the Moche Valley (Ravines 1984: 36, fig. 18). The relatively representational style of these figures stands in contrast to the mythological creatures shown in the Middle 4.

Another low relief found on Mound A consists of a design resembling a net (Ravines 1984: 35, fig. 16). Offerings were found in pits immediately in front of three of the Middle Temple friezes. Small figurines with painted, fanged faces were dressed in textiles. Burger (1992: 64) notes that one of the figurines had two spines of the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus on its back. Spines were also found in mud adobes in the fill of the Middle Temple. Burger suggests that a drink made from San Pedro may have been consumed in rituals at Garagay to facili- tate contact with the supernatural realm. Somewhat different architectural traditions were followed on the north coast of Peru in this period. The greatest amount of work in the region has been done in the Casma Valley, where there were at least five public centers, with a sixth developing near the end of the Initial period. Three have been investigated extensively: Cerro Sechin, Sechin Alto, and Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke (Pozorski and Pozorski 1987; Tello 1956). Whereas U-shaped architecture was the style of the Manchay culture of the central coast, compact, quadrangular mounds domi- nated Casma architecture. Cerro Sechin and Moxeke were both built as square platform mounds with rounded corners. Although Sechin Alto has been studied only recently (Pozorski and Pozorski 1999), the preliminary observations show that the huge principal mound is also roughly square, with a series of rectangular plazas. Sunken circular courts are found in plazas in front of the main mound; Tello (1956) observed a similar circular de- pression in front of Cerro Sechin. Perhaps such sunken circular courts were remnants or ^in- terpretations of the chambers of the Kotosh Religious Tradition, as they may have been at Cardal. These and the use of bilateral symme- try in overall plan, including details such as bipartite central stairways, link the Casma tra- dition to the Manchay culture and general practices throughout Peru in the Initial period. At Cerro Sechin there are four hundred or so incised granite blocks set into the outer- most wall of the principal structure. The rec- tangular stones, set vertically, show warriors marching toward a central staircase, which is flanked by banners at the head of each line of troops.4 Interspersed among these warriors are smaller stones with depictions of the defeated army. Naked, writhing figures are shown headless, cut in two, or with blood and entrails pouring from their bodies. Decapi- tated heads are rendered with eyes closed or hemorrhaging. This scene was the latest public art made at the site. An earlier phase seems to show a scene similar to the later carvings, with an upside-down human figure, eyes closed, and blood streaming from the skull. The first con- struction phase, however, contains a central room the entrance to which is flanked by a mural of large black felines. Public art at Sechin Alto has been discov- ered recently (Pozorski and Pozorski 1999). The evidence uncovered so far is fragmentary and consists of about twenty to thirty centimeters 5 . Drawing of reliefs from Moxeke After Tello 1956: 61, fig. 27 QUILTER 25</page><page sequence="7">of what appears to be the bottom of a wall. Two large-scale symmetrical designs of what look like eccentric eyes (though pre- sumably representing something else), in a style resembling Chavin, have been found in low, flat relief. As best as can be determined, the general design and bold colors conform to Initial period styles. The site known as Pampa de las Llamas- Moxeke is dominated by two large mounds, Moxeke and Huaca A. At Moxeke, a number of high-relief figures and massive sculpted heads (fig. 5 ) were discovered on the principal mound earlier in the twentieth century by Julio C. Tello. The figures were located in niches some ten meters above ground level. They probably stood about three meters in height, perhaps higher, as the heads were missing by the time they were excavated. The figures were dressed in tunics, skirts, and mantles, with slight differences among them. Such slight differences are also evident in the large heads, found in niches on the side of the building: one has its eyes and mouth closed, while another has bared teeth. Twelve hundred meters from Moxeke, across an expanse of plain with large plazas in it, Huaca A is aligned close to the main axis of the platform just described. Huaca A is a rectangular, multiroomed structure, com- posed of small quadrangular rooms arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The form and orga- nization suggest an agglomeration of stan- dardized versions of the Kotosh Religious Tra- dition chambers, lacking sunken floors and hearths. Shelia and Thomas Pozorski (1987: 34), who excavated Huaca A, interpret the structure as a public storehouse, although the relative cleanliness of the floors suggests ritual functions for these rooms, fitting more neatly with the characteristics of the archi- tecture. Low-relief clay felines decorate the main entrance of the building, but otherwise no public art was found. The only exception to this is a cut and polished stone about 45 cm in length. On one side a double-bodied snake was inscribed, while on the other side a de- pression resembling a handprint was carved into the rock (fig. 6). The handprint at Huaca A resembles a similar "imprint" sculpture found at the In- itial period site of Pacopampa, in the northern highlands. An image very similar to the Huaca A double-bodied snake is on one side of the stone, while two footprints are found on the upper surface (fig. 7). The feet are arranged as if someone had stood on the spot, sinking into the stone. Although only these two examples are known, the specific imagery of "im- pressed" body parts in stone above a double- bodied-snake-like being suggests that both drew upon a similar myth.5 The public art found at the architectural complex of Huaca de los Reyes, at Caballo Muerto in the Moche Valley (Conklin 1985; Pozorski 1975, 1980), is similar in many ways to that of Moxeke in the Casma Valley,- both sites date to roughly the same time period (c. 1300 b.c.). At both sites, the primary con- struction material is river cobbles, set in mud mortar and covered with thick coasts of adobe plaster. At Huaca de los Reyes, three large heads (when complete they would have been over two meters high), with grimacing faces, are reminiscent of the friezes at Mox- eke (Moseley and Watanabe 1974). As with the Casma heads, the Huaca de los Reyes heads are distinguished, one from another, 6. Incised stones from Huaca A, Pampa de las Llamas- Moxeke After Burger 1992: 175, fig. 176 7.

Plan of Chavín de Huántar After Burger 1992: fig. 120; drawing by Annick Peterson by slight variations in the form and details. The same is true of the lower fragments of a frieze that, when complete, probably depicted frontal anthropomorphic, possibly human, figures. Three pairs of feet and lower legs have been preserved. Once again, each set is slightly different from the others within a fairly rigid, overall uniform design. The variation within standardized forms at both Moxeke and Huaca de los Reyes suggests a kind of transition between the more free-floating figures at sites such as Garagay and the highly standardized forms of Chavín de Huántar. The gods and other supernaturais at the earlier sites appear to be relatively individualistic, not yet codi- fied in a standardized system of representa- tion. Individual deities are distinguished at Chavín, but the rigidity of the art style frames them within a common conceptual frame- work. These ranges of stylistic conventions and the variations within them may reflect the kinds of social units which interacted with deities and the cult centers where these were worshipped. Initial period art thus demonstrates a great degree of diversity within recognizable styles. Stylistic unity is evident largely through the emphasis on line in these wall friezes and murals. Lines dominate even when the medi- um is modeled clay, as at Garagay. From what we can reconstruct of color use, this seems to have been employed more to produce a bright effect than to demarcate space or volume. A further characteristic is the apparent pre- dominance of architecture over painted and modeled art. Donald Lathrap (1985) suggested that U- shaped complexes symbolized the mouth of a cosmic cayman. If so, it was stylized to the point that such references were either known only to a select few or, if a wider audience was aware of such symbolism, they were well known enough to be manifest in a highly abstract manner. So too, the two "imprint" sculptures suggest that the people who visi- ted temple sites brought with them at least a partial comprehension of the symbolic sys- tem in which they were to participate at these centers. The commonly occurring motif of a stylized monster head on ceramics contem- porary with this architecture (Cupisnique style pottery) suggests that the emblems dis- played on Initial period temple walls were well known to the general populace. We do not fully understand the antecedents to the Initial period symbolic system as mani- fested in architecture. There are no known precedents: it appears fullblown, and without the expected precursors in other media, such as pyro-engraved gourds. It is clear, however, that Initial period sources inspired Chavín. Chavín de Huántar The people who built the ceremonial center of Chavín de Huántar in the central highlands took the familiar forms of Initial period cen- ters and synthesized and transformed them into something new and extremely powerful. The monumental sector of Chavín de Huán- tar consists of several major architectural features, built at different times (fig. 8). The major buildings include the Old Temple, with a circular sunken court in front of it, and QUILTER 27</page><page sequence="9">9. Tenoned head, Cha vín de Huántar contiguous to this, the New Temple, which was added on to the Old Temple. The interi- ors of these buildings are labyrinths of narrow corridors and chambers. Chavín de Huántar drew upon coastal architectural forms and iconography. Initial period centers in the highlands are integrated into the surrounding landscape: sites such as Pacopampa feature terraces formed by modi- fying natural hills. Chavín, however, follows the coastal pattern of standing out from the landscape. Further, the U-shape of the origi- nal Old Temple and its circular court clearly follow coastal formats. But by the time the New Temple was built onto this structure, the population of Chavín was inventing a new tradition. Ephemeral adornments to the architecture at Chavín, if they ever existed, have disap- peared, but the beautiful carved stone monu- ments that once graced the temple complexes (some of which are still in their original po- sitions) convey an idea of the grandeur of the site. White granite and black limestone, quarried kilometers away, were shaped into blocks, and intricate designs were crisply incised into the polished stone. Much of the sculpted architectural ornament is on the exteriors of buildings and courts. Three- dimensional heads were tenoned into the architecture (fig. 9), and some low-relief carving was used on the façades of buildings and along the sides of courts. In contrast to the Initial period preference for bold colors, there is little evidence for paint at Chavín de Huántar. The rainy high- land environment may be partly to blame. The highly polished surfaces of many sculp- tures do not necessarily preclude the possi- bility that they were painted, since at Chavín and other sacred sites polishing or other spe- cial efforts were apparently done for the eyes of the gods, not mortals: the backs and other unseen areas were also carefully finished. Nevertheless, polished surfaces would be un- likely to retain paint well. Burger (1992: 179) notes traces of pigment on carved stone slabs in the Chamber of the Ornamental Beams, but the stone surfaces there are rough. It is probable that if paint was used on highly polished carvings, it was applied to the inci- sions to accent them. Some conventions of Initial period art were continued in Chavín times. The ring of 28 QUILTER warriors carved in low relief on blocks in the circular court in front of the Old Temple may have derived from Initial period art, as sug- gested by remains at Garagay, but, for the most part, Chavín invented itself, magnify- ing and complicating the styles employed to present mystifying supernaturais. In formal terms, however, one important characteristic does seem to continue on from the Initial period: the emphasis on line. Stone and other media are treated as surfaces for engraving: other than the tenoned heads, there is little interest in three-dimensional form and space. The emphasis on line was taken to new extremes at Chavín de Huántar. Exquisite stone engravings are found throughout the site, sometimes in unexpected places, such as the underside of lintels. Chavín artistic conventions have been studied by a number of scholars (Roe 1974,- Rowe 1962; Tello i960; see Burger 1992). Tello noted the practice of elimination and substitution, as when snakes replace whis- kers on a jaguar. John Rowe calls this a form of visual metaphor, comparable to kennings in Old Norse poetry. Peter Roe has pointed out an architectural conception of design in Chavín art, in which a complex depiction was treated as a composite of autonomous units drawn from a finite repertoire of elements - a pattern that was noted above as perhaps hav- ing its origins in Initial period art. Another convention is anatropism, in which a figure can be rotated 1800 and still have visual meaning. This is particularly evident in the Raimondi Stela (fig. 10), which when viewed</page><page sequence="10">upright, depicts an anthropomorphic figure, holding staves and wearing an elaborate head- dress. When turned upside-down, the head- dress appears to become a zoomorphic crea- ture. Finally, Chavln art emphasizes modular width and bilateral symmetry. The former refers to a standardized field of organization, so that the carvings appear to have been made on an imaginary graph of parallel bands of equal width. Bilateral symmetry provides balance in relation to a vertical axis, whether within an image itself or in a field of images grouped together. The convention of modular width is an innovation at Chavln, instituting a certain rigid standardization of design. Initial period art employed modular units, but the render- ings were much more rounded, less crisp and exacting. Although, to a certain extent, medi- um may have played a role in this, mud plas- ter can also be shaped with a high degree of precision, indicating that the rigidity of stone carving at Chavín de Huántar was a matter of choice. So too, bilateral symmetry was used occasionally in Initial period art, but it was never adopted as rigorously and consistently as at Chavín. The ingenuity of Chavín art lay not simply in what was portrayed but how the portrayal was carried out. Cautious, experimental practices first seen in Initial period art are elaborated and codified at Chavín de Huántar. We may assume that all of the art so far discussed was designed to produce an emo- tional response in the viewer as part of a religious experience. Initial period art was meant to impress and to awe, and it does so by the power of the imagery of supernaturais, brightly painted, projecting from the walls of sacred precincts. Chavín art took those same objectives and increased the emotional re- sponse by presenting powerful, visually con- fusing images within the framework of a highly regularized, patterned means of repre- sentation. Chavín art unites two contradic- tory realities, perhaps as a way to emphasize the sanctity of the imagery and the experi- ence of the architectural spaces. The visual program is at the same time highly chaotic and highly ordered. Richard Burger (1992: 147) has noted how Chavín art is visually confusing to the unin- itiated. For example, features of different ani- mals are combined in one being, a practice also found in the Initial period. At Chavín the mixing includes flora and fauna from differ- ent Andean environments, such as tropical forest plants and animals, highland jaguars and eagles, and coastal dwellers such as Strombus and Spondylus molluscs. These mixtures and combinations created a sense of awe and con- fusion to the uninitiated, but could be read by the initiated as symbolic of the transforma- tive nature of supernaturais. Transformation was emphasized in the tenoned heads found on the exterior of the New Temple at Chavín de Huántar, where an anthropomorphic head is in the process of becoming a fanged mon- ster (fig. 9; Burger 1992: 157-159). Chavín art may have confused and bewil- dered the uninitiated, but its underlying mes- sage was that differences can be unified into a single form. Different animal parts or sub- stitutions in art of one thing for another replicated and reinforced belief in the role assumed by Chavín to bind together diverse peoples and places in ancient Peru within the unifying system of the temple cult. Perhaps only the elites of distant commu- nities were allowed access to the most holy shrines at Chavín, but it seems likely that large numbers made the journey to the site and experienced at least part of its mystique. Much of the imagery, present as it was on the exterior of architecture, was potentially avail- able to great numbers of viewers. Thus, some QuiLTER 29 10. Two drawings (one upside-down) of the Raimondi Stela, from Chavín de Huántar After Burger 1992: 175, fig. 176</page><page sequence="11">of the most elaborate art ever produced in the Americas was made at a high aesthetic level not to please a royal family or a handful of aristocrats, but to impress outsiders. These were outsiders who, having been to Chavin, would have been incorporated into the select group of individuals who had made the pil- grimage, strengthening even more the power of the religious center to attract more visitors and adherents. The prosperity of the larger enterprise, including the support population living around the New Temple, was tied to maintaining the site as simultaneously re- stricted and sacred and, to a certain degree, open and accessible. The Context of Moche Public Art Previous conceptions of a monolithic Moche culture are giving way to alternative models positing two or more distinct political enti- ties, which quite likely varied in the ways they utilized a widely shared symbol system (see Shimada 1994b). Recent and continuing work will provide a more fine-grained view of changes in artistic styles and shifts in ide- ology. Nevertheless, Moche seems to have been a culture in which a consistent, rela- tively narrow set of artistic conventions was used across a distinct temporal and geograph- ical range by peoples sharing similar ide- ologies and sentiments. These people also shared common subsistence economies, war- fare practices, and other social behavior, including generally similar patterns of social and political organization. Even if there were distinct political entities within what we consider Moche culture, a common art style and ideology appear to have been shared by them. By the time Moche culture developed on the north coast of Peru, Chavin de Huántar lay in ruins. Its religious and political authori- ty had collapsed, as had stable social and eco- nomic systems. The exact timing and pattern of the dissolution of Chavin influence or hegemony still remain to be documented, but no matter how many years separated the col- lapse of Chavin and the rise of Moche and other Early Intermediate period cultures, the drastic change in art styles which occurred seems to have been more a deliberate rejec- tion of past conventions rather than a forget- ting of them. 30 QUILTER In the highlands, in the general area of the Chavin heartland, the subsequent Recuay style emphasized a simplified rendering of anthropomorphic and human forms in what appears to be an almost rustic mode of carv- ing compared to the precision stonework of Chavin (fig. 11). This could be read as a dimi- nution in the skill level of artisans or as the inability of an elite, reduced in power, to mobilize human and other resources to pro- duce elaborate art. But it also can be read as a conscious elevation of a more simple, straightforward artistic style and ideology, one that concurred with the bellicose warrior ethic represented in Recuay sculpture, in con- trast to the baroque twists and turns of an esoteric Chavin religious cult. On the coast, some Chavin influence appears to have lingered in the Salinar style, but the rulers of Moche dominated north coast culture partly by employing new visual ideas, expressed in a different manner. The creators of Moche art and architecture re- jected many Chavin conventions, while con- tinuing to elaborate certain Initial period ideas, many of which had never completely faded from coastal art. Whereas Initial period and Chavin art tend to confront the viewer with larger-than-life portrayals of supernaturais, Moche architec- tural art emphasizes human forms, rendered on a human scale. Moche figures traverse the plane in which they are depicted rather than coming out of that plane - narrative 1 1 . Recuay stone carvings</page><page sequence="12">sequences are painted or rendered in low relief across an expanse of wall. Moche fig- ures often float on a plain, light-colored back- ground, with little or no indication of a ground line or contextual setting, in noncon- frontational poses (figs. 12, 13; see Gálvez and Briceño, this volume; Uceda, this volume). Even scenes depicting warfare have low emo- tional impact, as the viewer's position is per- pendicular to the plane of action. The viewer observes figures interacting with one another, whereas with Initial period architectural art, the viewer is often directly confronted by the gaze of towering supernatural figures. This is not to say that the preference for profile figures, such as those seen at the Huaca Cao Viejo of the El Brujo complex (Gálvez and Briceño, this volume), is entirely new in Moche art. This traversing of the plane of representation, and the placement of figures so as to float in space, can be seen in Initial period art at Garagay and elsewhere. A painted column at Casa Grande, La Libertad (Bonavia 1985: 30, fig. 18), for example, shows a human figure in Chavin style, but painted in profile. Nevertheless, even though there are shared conventions of representation in the Initial and Moche periods, the intentions were different. Moche public art and the ritual spaces where it was found were, as with Chavin, innovative, yet they harked back to earlier traditions. Flat-topped pyramidal structures, first seen in the Preceramic period, were emphasized, while the Initial period and Chavin convention of sunken circular plazas was rejected. The concept of monumental architecture itself may also have shifted. At Chavin, the hollow core of the Old Temple contained the Lanzón, a sculpted monolith probably representing a living presence deep in the bowels of the earth (Burger 1992: 136- 137). For the Moche, however, their adobe structures contained dead potentates instead of evocations of living gods. The sequential entombment of kings or aristocracy in plat- forms, such as at Sipán (see Alva, this vol- ume) and Huaca de la Luna (Uceda, this vol- ume), may have increased the sanctity of the place and those buried in it - a conception radically different from previous eras. The personal confrontation with and trans- formation by the divine, hinted at by the mouth-band frieze at Cardal and the laby- rinths of the temples at Chavin de Huántar, seem to have no equivalents among the Moche. When Moche priests moved from the profane world of everyday life or plazas in lower temple precincts to the holiest shrines of the divine, they moved upward and in plain view. Many Moche platforms boast elaborate ramps, perhaps designed to extend the pro- cess of approaching the holy. Those privileged to enter the New Temple at Chavin de Huán- tar disappeared into it and then reappeared, as if by magic, to those watching below, through the use of carefully hidden stairs (Burger 1992). But Moche priests could be viewed gradually ascending to the sacred heights.6 If pilgrimage was a central, unifying aspect of the Chavin cult, resulting in one major center, in the Moche culture there were mul- tiple centers of comparable size and elabo- ration. We are still unclear how Moche re- ligious centers were organized in terms of larger constituencies in the Moche world and beyond, but the evidence suggests a more regional, perhaps polity-based, system of wor- ship and attendance at sacred sites. In any case, pilgrimage to Chavin meant journeying from afar to enter, if one was deemed worthy, deep into the ultimate mystery enclosed by the massive stone temple at Chavin de Huántar. For the Moche, the replication of the pilgrim's journey may have been trans- formed into the movement of priests or sup- plicants within the temple complex itself, out in the open until the final rites high on the temple top. Pilgrimage in such a setting was not to an autochthonous core of an ulti- mate reality, but to the heights from which the gods looked down on mortals. Even if the holiest Moche rites were secluded in shrines on temple summits, rituals occurred in front of numbers of people, and the imagery of these activities appears to have been widely disseminated. The mass slaughter of warriors at Huaca de la Luna (see Bourget, this volume,- Verano, this volume) might not have been witnessed by just anyone, but its staging in a plaza suggests that there were more than a few onlookers. Scenes showing sacrificial acts, prisoners, and implements of war are found in several media, including ceramics (Alva andDonnan 1993: 127-141). This explicit representation of military and sacrificial practices is in contrast to most In- itial period, Chavin, and Andean art in general. QuiLTER 31</page><page sequence="13">12. Reconstruction drawing of Huaca Cao Viejo After Franco, Gálvez, and Vasquez 1994: fig. 4.12 Although some reference to warriors is present at Garagay, Cerro Sechin, and Chavín de Huántar, the emphasis on these themes is relatively minor. In most Andean art, refer- ences to violence also are relatively muted. Even among the exceptions, such as some Nasca art, symbols of sacrifice are inter- twined with clear indications of fertility. Fur- thermore, the cultures we might expect to be most bellicose in art, if it mirrored life, are the conquest states of Wari and the Inca, yet these have the fewest overt indications of warfare and sacrifice in public art.7 The Moche stand out from other Andean cultures in the emphasis they placed on war and related cults of sacrifice. The closest parallels are to be found not in the Andes but in Mesoamerica, particularly the Maya and the Aztecs. Public representations of sacrifice and warfare may help us understand the unique contours of Moche religious thought and the principles by which their society operated. 32 QUILTER While the scale and nature of Moche war- fare is still a topic of debate (see Verano, this volume), their art depicts violence in a very direct way. No interpretive key is needed to understand the basic events occurring in much of Moche art, as the scenes are ren- dered in what we see as a more veristic or representational style. This use of representa- tion and the related phenomenon of narrative exposition are unique to Moche. Considering the reasons why this choice of art style was made may help us understand Moche state- craft as one that relied on a program in which the representation of ritualized violence was central. Huaca Cao Viejo, Paôamarca and Huaca de la Luna as Case Studies Huaca Cao Viejo, Pañamarca and Huaca de la Luna may serve as case studies of Moche public art. These sites have received consider- able study and are relatively well published,</page><page sequence="14">although the amount of work at them has varied. Public art at each of these sites will be briefly described before comparative discussion. Huaca Cao Viejo, part of the El Brujo com- plex, is located less than a kilometer from the Pacific Ocean, near the mouth of the Chi- cama River and close to the important Pre- ceramic site of Huaca Prieta. The monumen- tal platform mound is oriented to the north, with a large plaza extending out in front of the ornamented façade. Ongoing work at the site is uncovering new evidence of architec- tural ornament on the summit and else- where, which will undoubtedly alter our impressions of the nature of this complex monument. Recent work there has revealed terraces at the front of the main structure, dating to the penultimate and last building phases of this part of the site (Gálvez and Briceno, this volume,- Franco, Gálvez, and Vasquez 1994). The clearing of several differ- ent walls here provides us with the possibility of insights into how these renderings may have looked as an ensemble to those gathered in the plaza and on the terraces (fig. 12). A complex structure, encompassing several enlargements and other renovations, Huaca Cao Viejo contains architectural reliefs dating to different periods (see Gálvez and Briceño, this volume, for a detailed description). One of the earliest reliefs to have survived per- tains to the third-to-last phase of construc- tion. Found in a corner on the upper part of the structure (fig. 12, A), a fragment of the relief shows a geometric design of interlock- ing motifs. Narrative reliefs are also known from this phase (fig. 12, B). Although these reliefs are in poor condition, they show six repetitions of pairs of figures framed in a panel. On the left, a profile figure, with a crescent-shaped knife in one hand, grasps another figure, rendered on a smaller scale, by the hair. The majority of the extant reliefs at Huaca Cao Viejo date to the final construction phase. Figure 12, C, is a fragment of a relief depicting a creature with human and inverte- brate (arachnid?) traits and holding a sacri- ficial knife (Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1994: 1 70-1 71). Executed in a style resem- bling Garagay, it becomes clear not only that the Moche drew upon a considerable variety of styles concurrently, but that archaism may also have played a part in their artistic repertoire. 13. Detail of prisoner reliefs, Huaca Cao Viejo Photograph by Edward Ranney (©) QUILTER 33</page><page sequence="15">The two most striking reliefs, readily visi- ble and from a considerable distance, are found on two levels at the base of the façade of Huaca Cao Viejo (fig. 12, D, H). Both reliefs emphasize repetitions of human forms, in a scale slightly larger than lifesize. The pre- served sections cover both the long (north) walls facing the plaza and a section of the side (east) walls. Section D shows at least eighteen frontal human forms, in similar costume, clasping hands. Section H (fig. 13) depicts a victorious warrior leading ten or eleven naked, bound prisoners, a common scene in Moche art. Five warriors follow the prisoners, apparently carrying the weapons and cos- tumes of their victims. On the east wall of this same level (fig. 12, G), four other figures, in a poor state of preservation, may also repre- sent warriors. In the corner between the north and east wall, the prisoner scene is broken by the pres- ence of a small patio and rectangular chamber (fig. 12, E). The exterior of the west wall (fig. 12, F) is divided into four registers, filled with small-scale representations of pairs of warriors. Each register has six pairs of armed warriors facing and apparently fighting each other. Distinctions in dress and armaments are present and are highlighted in the arrange- ment of figures. The north wall, where the entrance to the chamber is located, and the adjacent east wall are both covered with a complex composition made up of numerous small figures with no clear organized pattern (fig. 14). The motifs relate to fishing, naviga- tion, and combat, and include depictions of terrestrial and aquatic fauna as well as flora. Pañamarca (fig. 15), in the Nepeña Valley, is mentioned in the travel account of Ephraim George Squier (1877) and was dis- cussed by Wendell Bennett (1939). The most detailed study of the site was conducted by 14. Detail of reliefs, Huaca Cao Viejo Photograph by Edward Ranney (©) 34 QUILTER</page><page sequence="16">1 5 . View of platform with the zigzag ramp, Pañamarca Photograph by Edward Ranney (©) Richard Schaedel ( 195 1; reprinted 1967), with subsequent investigations by Duccio Bonavia (1985). The principal ceremonial area at the site consists of an arrangement of plazas and buildings (fig. 16). Only a portion of the wall paintings and other works that undoubtedly graced much of the architectural complex has been exposed. The largest plazas and build- ings are located on the northern side of the site, and smaller rooms and courts are found on the south, adjacent to a platform with a zigzag ramp. It seems reasonable to suggest that the large, northern areas were designed to hold great numbers of people, while the smaller spaces in the south held fewer. Even so, what may have been a forecourt in front of the platform with a zigzag ramp has an area of about 200 m2, ample space to hold a sizable gathering. Except for a single wall painting (Mural C), found in a large northern plaza, most of the public art at Pañamarca has been identified in or near this forecourt. Most of the figures were rendered in bright poly- chrome against a white background. Mural C (fig. 17) is located on the western end of the largest plaza in the complex. Twelve meters of painting were uncovered by Schaedel, but it clearly extended much far- ther in antiquity. The top of the wall had been cut horizontally, long ago, but its present maximum height is 1.5 m (Bonavia 1985: 55). Eight large anthropomorphic figures are shown in this space.8 The heads of all the major figures are absent due to apparent cut- ting of the wall in the past. The figures are portrayed in typical Moche style, in proces- sion from right to left in relation to the viewer. One of the figures, the third from the left, is turned in the opposite direction to the general flow of the scene. Most figures have their hands raised. Two appear to be attended by smaller figures in simple dress. The princi- pal figures wear backflaps (ornamented ele- ments of sheet metal suspended from the waist of warriors), suggesting a military theme, although the figures do not appear to be engaged in combat. A small quadrangular structure is located close to the entrance of the plaza to the south (fig. 16, F). All of the walls here were painted, but only one motif could be identified by Bonavia (1985: 68). This image (fig. 18), known as Mural F, represents a spotted male feline. Other elements may have been present at one time,- unfortunately the poor condition of the mural has prevented any other identifications. QuiLTER 35</page><page sequence="17">1 6.

Drawing of Mural C, Pañamarca After Bonavia 1985: fig. 36; reconstruction drawing by Pedro Azabache Turning to the small court northwest of the monumental platform with the zigzag ramp, a number of paintings have survived. Two paintings (fig. 16, Murals D and B), were found on the exterior walls of the entryway into the court proper. Schaedel ( 195 1 : 153; 1967: 113) describes Mural D (fig. 19) as an "anthropo- morphic bird figure/7 Now destroyed, the fig- ure had an anthropomorphic body with a bird head. It is a creature rare in Moche art. Mural B (fig. 20), adjacent to Mural D, is a profile painting of a zoomorph, combining features of both a feline and a snail. Inside the court, in the southeast wall is a remnant of an earlier construction phase (fig. 16, A). Preserved through the entombing actions of subsequent renovations, Mural A (fig. 21) is a fragment of a larger painting. The preserved section shows two men, in profile, facing each other and grasping each other's hair at the forehead. They are dressed in iden- tical tunics, snake belts, and a kind of feline- head hat or hair decoration. Bonavia (1985: 49) notes that this scene has a long tradition on the Peruvian coast and may represent some kind of ceremonial contest. Mural E (fig. 22), also located in the court, is one of the most discussed, studied, and reproduced examples of Moche art. The sec- tion of the painting under consideration, no longer extant, was nearly three meters in length and a meter and a half in height.

On the left, and rendered in larger scale, is a female priestess with an elabo- rate headdress and a goblet, followed by two attendants, also carrying vessels. Behind them are depictions of seated, nude prisoners with ropes around their necks, and mythological animals. The last figure on the right appears to be in charge of the prisoners. On the extreme right is a large-scale representation of a bundle of weapons. Bonavia (1985: 59-64) notes that the mural originally continued beyond the weapons bundle, to the right, suggesting that the Presentation Theme may have been more extensive. The corner location of this frag- ment might also suggest that the scene pre- sented may have been less important than other imagery that would have been more prominently placed for viewers in the court. Huaca de la Luna has been investigated by a number of scholars, including Squier (1877), Max Uhle (191 3) and members of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project (Mackey and Hastings 1982, among others). Most recently, however, the monument and surrounding area have been the focus of a long-term pro- ject directed by Santiago Uceda and Ricardo Morales, involving the collaboration of an international team of researchers (Uceda, this volume,- Uceda et. al. 1994). As with Huaca Cao Viejo and many other Moche monuments, Huaca de la Luna was in use over a long period of time and was re- modeled many times (see Uceda, this volume, for a more detailed discussion). The majority of the architectural ornament dates to later phases of the architectural sequence (fig. 23). With the exception of the most recently exca- vated reliefs found on the north façade of Plat- form i, facing a large plaza known as the Great Plaza, the reliefs and paintings dis- cussed here are located in interior spaces. These most recent reliefs, similar in many QUILTER 37</page><page sequence="19">23- Reconstruction of Huaca de la Luna (final phases] Painting by Jorge Solorzano © Proyecto Huaca de la Luna, used with permission ways to those seen at Huaca Cao Viejo, are discussed in detail by Uceda (this volume). On Platform i, a court with decorated walls known as the Great Patio, probably dating to the penultimate building stage, was found placed on top of earlier constructions (fig. 23, A). The walls were covered with a composi- tion dominated by diamond shapes that serve as frames for a frontal fanged deity head with curly hair and figure-8 ears (fig. 24). The frames of the diamond panels are composed of a stylized interlocking zoomorphic design. The reliefs are boldy polychrome, with vivid reds and yellows, as well as white and black. In the southeast corner of the platform (fig. 23, B), researchers have identified an area they call the recinto sacerdotal (priests7 en- closure) (Campana and Morales 1997: 40, fig. 4). In several ways, this area is reminiscent of the chamber at Huaca Cao Viejo (fig. 12, E, F), in that it is stylistically quite distinct from the adjacent walls, with small-scale imagery (fig. 25). The composition is similar to a tex- tile design in its division into design blocks with repetitions and reversals of imagery. Two basic square design blocks are alternated and reversed: one shows a zoomorphic head 38 QUILTER with catfishlike whiskers, while the other is divided diagonally into two sections, one side repeating the zoomorphic head, the other bearing the image of a profile bird. A similar textilelike patterning has also been noted on a series of superimposed paintings elsewhere at Huaca de la Luna (fig. 23, C; Bonavia 1985: 85-97; Garrido 1956; Mackey and Hastings 1982). The earliest phase depicts a frontal anthropomorphic figure often referred to as the Staff God; this painting was then covered over, in two successive phases of remodeling, with compositions based on a checkerboard pattern. In the second phase the blocks con- tain an image of a supernatural visage, simi- lar to the one seen in the plaza area. In the third and final phase, the design is based on alternating blocks, one with zoomorphic motifs, and the other with an anthropo- morphic figure with zoomorphic forms on either side. A mural painting known as the Revolt of the Objects, was found on a nearby structure, Platform III, early in the twentieth century. This mural has been discussed at length by a number of scholars (for example Bonavia 1974, 1985: 72-84; Kroeber 1930: 71-33,- Lyon 1981;</page><page sequence="20">24- Detail of painted reliefs from Platform i, Huaca de la Luna 25. Detail of painted reliefs from the recinto sacerdotal , Platform i, Huaca de la Luna QUILTER 39</page><page sequence="21">Quilter 1990, 1997) and will be mentioned only briefly here. The painting shows a scene of animated military regalia and weapons attacking humans. Interestingly, the style of these figures resembles nothing else found at Huaca de la Luna or at Huaca Cao Viejo. It does resemble, however, the procession murals at Pañamarca, particularly Mural C. The Mimetic Moche Moche architecture was embellished with ambitious, large-scale programs of public art not previously seen in the Andean region. Wall paintings and reliefs appear on the ex- teriors and interiors of buildings, suggesting both potentially large as well as more re- stricted audiences. Most are vividly painted in bright colors, insuring that the exterior imagery would have been visible from con- siderable distances. To our understanding, the imagery, with its emphasis on anthropo- morphic forms and clear action, appears straightforward and relatively free of esoteric meanings. The imagery seems direct and to the point, depicting supernaturais and humans in easy-to-read styles. Mythic beings, or composite figures, are present, as they were in Initial period art, but in Moche art they seem clearer: they are isolated, outlined, and conventionalized. The representational art style of Moche was in the service of a religion, and a political system tied to it, which differed greatly from earlier traditions in the Andes. In many ways, Moche religion and art were unique in the context of the Andes and were traditions not wholly followed by subsequent cultures. The Moche seem to have demystified religion as presented in the Early Horizon. In Moche art, humans and humanlike gods took center stage, literally and figuratively. While there may have been restricted access to the most holy of rituals, overall, Moche ceremonies appear to have been more public than at Chavin.10 Ritual actors, imper- sonating gods or other key religious figures, undoubtedly performed sacrifices and other practices in a very public realm. The findings from San José de Moro (Castillo, this volume) and Sipán (Alva, this volume) of individuals dressed in the regalia of figures we see de- picted at Pañamarca and elsewhere reminds us of the extent to which these rituals were 40 QUILTER dramatized. Sacrificial rites only have social efficacy if people know about them. In Aztec Mexico, the height of the platforms of Tenochtitlan ensured that vast numbers of the city's population could witness sacrifices taking place on their summits. Whatever the specific performance context of Moche sacri- fice, it is likely that at least a portion of the ceremonies occurred in a place where a good- sized audience could view them. Our best evidence of sacrifice on a fairly large scale comes from Huaca de la Luna (Bourget, this volume). Although the bodies were ulti- mately deposited in a smaller, enclosed plaza, and not on Platform 1, from the iconographie depictions of sacrifice on Moche ceramics it seems that public ritual was an important component of at least part of the events. Spaces such as the newly excavated monu- mental plaza to the north of Platform 1 at the Huaca de la Luna may have provided a space for thousands to view specific events (Uceda, this volume). Much of the monumental art found at Moche sites replicated and emphasized ritual actions by costumed priests. Murals C and E (and A?) at Pañamarca, and the march of prisoners at Huaca Cao Viejo, were renderings of events that probably took place near or in front of the art that depicted them. We may conclude that the adoption of a representa- tional art style by the Moche was part of an integrated approach to demonstrate the power of rulers,- a power centered on the action of humans in a recognized social matrix of relationships. The more esoteric, more intimate, individualized approach to religious experience of the Initial period and Chavin was set aside for a brutal, straight- forward message. No more the transcenden- tal confrontation with the divine in the cool darkness of the inner sanctum or tracing the solidified footprints of an immanent deity. Rather, Moche was about blood in the sand under a harsh sky and the murmur of the crowd; the flash of the sacrificial knife wielded by a god impersonator. The Aztecs, too, followed similar princi- ples, although the conventions of their art were somewhat different. Public rituals of sacrifice, priests in the skins of flayed vic- tims, the display of scores or more of skulls on racks in plazas, and art celebrating war- riors and grisly gods made the message of the</page><page sequence="22">might of the Aztec state clear to friend and foe alike. At Huaca de la Luna, the interior friezes and paintings of Platform i did not replicate human action but served as backdrops. De- pictions of the deity, repeated across the ex- panse of the walls, diffused its power, reduc- ing the confrontational experience with the divine.11 At the same time, however, the re- dundancy of the deity image reinforced the centralized religious and political power in the ceremonial complex. The repetition of projecting heads from the wall may be a re- vival or continuance of the notion of the tenoned heads of Chavín de Huántar. But if every element of the total design had sym- bolic meaning, the redundancy drove home the ideology conveyed by the symbolism, but also visually and psychologically became design and scenery for actions in front of it. At Huaca Cao Viejo and Huaca de la Luna, the northern orientation of the plazas, the small corner rooms and other architectural features suggest that, to a certain degree, there were standard architectural plans for Moche religious structures.12 At both sites, the corner structures break the flow of the eye's movement, and this rupture is accentuated by the change in scale of wall decoration. The little patio with a ramp in front of the room at Huaca Cao Viejo suggests that it may not have been just a vestry or sacristy but a focal point for ritual activity. With only one way in and out, this was a place from which someone may have emerged for performances. We thus have an interesting contrast in the rituals of Chavín and Moche. At Chavín de Huántar, mystifying art and architectural tricks, such as labyrinthine interiors, ensured that the visitor would be kept in a state of con- fusion. Rumblings and otherworldly noises from within the temple, created through the use of certain architectural features of the temples, must have heightened the sense of disorientation. A visitor would be offered a tantalizing glimpse, but rarely a complete view, of a supernatural world beyond his or her understanding and experience. Moche religion may have demystified esoteric knowledge to a certain degree, but the expo- sure of a critical ritual of sacrifice to a wider audience emphasized lines drawn between social ranks. There is no greater manifesta- tion of power differential than that of sacri- ficer and sacrificed, no matter how much the act is cloaked in a sacred mantle. The Moche retained or revived many artis- tic conventions of the Initial period, yet they put these old approaches to new social uses. The Initial period and Moche artists shared a love of bright colors, outlined figures, modeled relief, supernatural scale, and styl- ized forms. In both traditions, figures are often in profile, floating on light-colored backgrounds, with little or no indication of specific context. But the Moche added a human dimension to art, offering a more direct referent to ritual. The Moche super- natural world was intimately and expressly tied to the earthly social one. All the major gods of the Moche pantheon have anthropo- morphic or zoomorphic traits that bring them much closer to the experiences of everyday humans than the gods which had previously presided over Peruvian realities. The high degree of artistry and craftsman- ship of Chavín and the more utilitarian, straightforward presentational style of Moche public art do not represent the linkage of stair-step evolutionary progress in the arts one might expect to find with increased po- litical complexity. Political power and elabo- ration of art style appear to be inversely related: the larger and more complex the polity, the greater the need for a simplified art style that is "readable" by vast numbers of people.13 Moche society was probably much more hierarchical than Chavín, yet its archi- tectural art was less "complex." Moche art and religion were didactic, meant to impress upon their audience who was victorious and who was vanquished, who was sacrificer and who was victim, who was ruler and who was ruled. It is for this reason also that the narra- tive tale of Moche mythology, itself expressed in ritual, was repeated in various media and saw its strongest expression when Moche society was at its most vulnerable, near its end. While the mythology, ideology, and prac- tice of human sacrifice were controlled, manipulated, and broadcast by an elite for centuries, they eventually succumbed to new social forces which arose late in the Early Intermediate period. QUILTER 41</page><page sequence="23">NOTES I thank many for aid and comfort. Joanne Pillsbury gave excellent advice in the final editing process of the paper. My fellow conferees were generous and open in sharing their knowledge, with many kindly offering opportunities to publish versions of their illustrations. Michel Conan was very influential in encouraging me to consider the art from the perspective of the viewer. Richard Burger was his usual kind and generous self in sharing much with me on details and larger ideas. Sarah Quilter offered much to consider as well, including commentary on a draft of the paper and, in particular, reference to Mohammed's footprints in Jerusalem (size 18 according to Mark Twain]. Karen Stothert also kindly provided useful commentary. Ingrid Gibson is thanked for her help in translating the abstract. Janice Williams was of great aid in editorial work to produce the final paper. I wish to offer my special thanks to all of my Peruvian colleagues who gave tours of the Huaca de la Luna and the Huaca Cao Viejo in August 1999. That experience greatly enriched and increased my appreciation of those who have lived and worked on the north coast of Peru, both in the distant past and in the present. i . For the purposes of this essay, finer chronological considerations are set aside, and the Initial period is treated as a single moment in time. 2. A dual altar at Cardal consists of what appear to be a pair of short 3 -step stairs on either side of a wall. The design in the Garagay emblem is shown as a sin- gle "step" (or a double one if the top is counted]. Although this is speculative, the use of extensive terraces in Andean architecture, such as those slightly earlier at El Paraíso, and later uses of terraces in agriculture, suggests that the design might be associated with mountains. 3. Only one photograph is available of the original pair. The second frieze was destroyed before it could be recorded but, according to Ravines (1984), was similar to the preserved one. 4. The banners at Cerro Sechin, the emblems on the frieze at Garagay, and a similar emblem reported by Burger at Cardal suggest distinct icons of group identity or at least allegiance to a common ideology. In the case of the central coast, this identity or common ideology may have extended beyond a single valley system. 5 . A review of the monumental study of Peruvian rock art by Antonio Núñez Jiménez (1986] found no petroglyphs similar to the ones discussed for Paco- pampa and Huaca A, suggesting that if more are to be found they would be excavated in temple complexes. It would interesting to consider from a comparative perspective how such carvings may have been related to larger programs of pilgrimage and worship at such centers. For example, there is a huge "footprint" carved in rock atop Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka, near the town of Dalhousie. A place of pilgrimage for centuries, Muslims attribute the footprint to Adam, Buddhists say it was Buddha, and Hindus, Lord Shiva. There is also the rock in the center of the Mosque of Omar in Jerusalem discusssed by Mark Twain (1990 [1869]: 375). This boulder is believed to have been the place where Abraham almost sacri- ficed Jacob, where David persuaded an angel not to destroy Jerusalem, and where Mohammed ascended to heaven. Footprints claimed to be Mohammed's are on the rock, as are the fingermarks of the Angel Gabriel, who seized the boulder to prevent it ascend- ing to heaven with The Prophet. 6. See for example the zigzag ramp which prolongs the climb to the top of the mound at Pañamarca and a similar ramp at Huaca Grande, at the site of Pampa Grande (Shimada 1994a). Moore (1996: 58) notes that the access pattern at Huaca Grande was more restric- tive than earlier Moche platforms, including a long approach through a corridor and an uppermost plat- form enclosed by a wall (see Haas 1985). Even if later Moche platform summits were enclosed and views restricted, they were being cordoned off on the basis of an earlier architectural plan designed for public view, thus sending a contradictory message of open- ness and closure at the same time. 7. We must be cautious, however, about how we view seemingly abstract art styles. Future research may alter this view. As Tom Cummins (in press) has shown, a distinct ťoqapu (a term referring to abstract designs found on textiles and other objects) symbol may be a stylized rendering of skulls and bones, alluding to the power and fearfulness of Inca military might. So too, the small gold and silver Inca figurines, long delighted in for the skill of their manufacture, are now known to be companions of Inca capac hucha sacrificial victims. In both of these cases, modern investigators had previously missed the references to warfare and sacrifice, respectively, in these art works because of a lack of cultural reference points and, in the case of the ťoqapu, the highly stylized nature of the representation. 8. Bonavia (1985: 55) notes that after Schaedel's work unknown people cleared some more paintings reveal- ing a few new figures. They are similar to the ones here described. 9. This is also known as the Sacrifice Ceremony (see Alva andDonnan, 1993: 127-141). 10. For Chavin to have maintained itself it is likely that public rituals were also held there. The issue is one of emphasis. 1 1 . In the succeeding Chimú culture, stylized fret- work similar to the decorations around the heads at Huaca de La Luna come to dominate the walls of Chan Chan (Pillsbury 1993). Even though messages of power were integrated into friezes (Pillsbury 1996), the design element seems to dominate over didactic purposes. 12. Although I have not been able to examine a plan or picture of it, perhaps the small quadrangular room immediately outside of the courtyard at Pañamarca, on which Mural F was found, served the same purpose as the small rooms at the other two sites. 13.
