ECONOMICS AND POLITICS (By SIR LENNON RAWS) It may be that we have swung too far from our normal care-free optimism and have become morbidly introspec tive: that we are spending too much time on analysing the causes of our troubles. If we prolong unduly this process the clinical diagnosis may turn into a post-mortem dissec tion. If, for example, we are going to wait until we have satisfied ourselves that what is called equality of sacrifice has been secured?which perhaps is merely an euphemistic phrase for dodging our own responsibilities?before we start to explore the road to prosperity?that road may become more difficult to find, and we may miss it altogether. One may hesitate, therefore, to prolong discussion, but there are one or two points in the current situation which call for comment. In a broadcast address some two months ago, Professor Henry Clay, of Manchester, pointed out that in primitive days there was a widespread belief that famine and other economic disasters were attributable to malevolent spirits, which spirits our ancestors spent much time in attempting to propitiate. He said that nowadays there was a similar widespread belief that economic misfortunes were due to malevolent agencies, which were personified in whatever might be the local incarnation of, say, capitalism with one section; socialism, or bolshevism with the other; the banks; the gold standard; trades unions; and we might add in Aus tralia the Arbitration Court and the Tariff. We do not attempt to propitiate these evil spirits; we heave bricks at them! 3$</page><page sequence="2">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June. 1931. Economics and Politics Professor Clay did not suggest that these institutions were not proper subjects of examination, but that the belief iti their malevolent influence was not based on intelligent study of their operations, and was charged with a passion and personal feeling which was as irrational as the primi tive belief in demonism. We are suffering acutely from anthropomorphism in Australia to-day. Schemes of economic reconstruction have become identified with individuals, and consequently consideration of them is being charged with personal feel ing and bias?political, social, even in some instances sec tarian. The result is that instead of co-operation and unity of purpose there is discord. Jealousy, suspicion and fear are fomented by declamation and invective, and in such an atmosphere it is impossible to cultivate that sane and realis tic public sentiment which is essential if people are to co-operate intelligently and whole-heartedly in the work of reconstruction. It is difficult at the best of times for the spectator to keep a cool head at a dog-fight, and that is what the poli tical turmoil in Australia to-day reminds one of. Under lying the ostensible issues round which this political dog-fight is waging, there are very important prin ciples at stake; but, disregarding these, the irony of the situation lies in the fact that the consequences of the fight will be borne by the spectators and not by the contestants, and that it is the spectators who alone can settle the real question and not those who are making a noise about some thing which only indirectly affects the real issue. We have heard a lot about the national income. In come depends in the last analysis on work, saving and management. All that political action can do is to alter the distribution of the income. Individuals or sections may profit at the expense of the community, but not all individuals and all sections can profit at the expense of the 37</page><page sequence="3">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June, 1931. Economics and Politics community. We have had many examples of sections bene fiting at the expense of the community, the coal industry, for example, and the sugar industry. When wages have not been correlated to productive activity losses have been imposed on those whose wages could not be so fixed, principally the export industries. The subject of Professor Clay's address was "Econo mic Responsibility". He said that the dependence of in come on effort had been obscured by three changes in the modern economic world. First the increase of specialisation, whereby individuals and industries have become more and more single stages in a long productive process; and consequently the result of economic activity is not so clearly seen. Secondly the extension of social services has meant that a large element of income is no longer dependent on any economic effort on the part of the recipient. Thirdly, the overlap of political and economic organisa tions has tended to obscure the source of economic responsi bility and to shift it from the worker to the politician. The Premiers' Conference in Melbourne is a recogni tion of the fundamental fact that although political action can alter the distribution of income it cannot directly in crease it. National income is the sum total of all the pro ductive processes of a State?whether in the shape of goods or services. For reasons which will be dealt with later, Australia's national income has declined by ?200 mil lions. On the other hand, Government expenditure has increased by ?10 millions. Whereas in 1928 Government expenditure was 29% of national income, this coming year, unless drastic economies are made, it will be 45%. A large proportion of this expenditure is non-productive. Take social services as an example. The expenditure on pen sions, education, health in Australia increased from ?9| millions in 1914 to ?39i millions in 1930. 38</page><page sequence="4">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June. 1931. Economics and Politics These benefits are given principally to one section of the community at the expense of other sections. I do not say they are not justified?on the contrary. Even though they do not add directly to the national income, they may indirectly enable the total income to be increased; and *if the cost is not greater than the? benefit, social ser vices are justified economically, apart from any other con sideration. The reduction in the national income has made the weight of social services correspondingly heavier. The section of the community which bears the bulk of the charge has suffered such a reduction of income that its ability to provide the means through taxation has diminished seri ously. If therefore social services are to be continued un abated, the weight must impinge on wages. As long as this is dearly understood and accepted by all concerned, well and good: There is no magic purse out of which the costs of these services can be defrayed. Governments do not pay pensions; they merely appropriate income provided by someone else. The idea that Government can create income is fallacious. Watering the currency, extending credits, repudiating debts, reducing interest, do not add one penny to total income. They are what Sir Ernest Benn termed "bloody book-keeping." In order to provide for this gargantuan mass of Gov ernment expenditure, the credit structure is being strained to the utmost. Inflation is taking place at an alarming rate. The productive services are being starved for the benefit of the non-productive. This means that there is deflation in trade and industry at a time when credit re sources should be available to create employment. There fore it is most important that Government expenditure should be reduced to the point where at least it does not prevent the revival of trade and employment. In that</page><page sequence="5">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June. 1931. Economics and Politics reduction every section must be prepared to make its sacrifice. That is the vital problem of the moment: but it is not enough merely to readjust the respective shades of the national income. Really that is only important as a step towards increasing total income. In Australia to-day there is the apparent paradox of a high volume of physical production with a serious loss of income. The reason of this is two-fold. If we were absolutely self-contained (which no modern country is), that is, traded with no country outside our borders, Aus tralia would be prosperous instead of depressed because the price tags attached to goods and services would have no utility except as a guide to exchange values within the State. However, in overseas trade, values count, not volume. A third of Australia's material production is ex ported, and fetches what the world is willing to pay for it. As approximately 97% of this third is primary pro duction, the first loss of ijicome through fall in world's prices falls directly on one section of the community. The second reason is that during recent years our in come has been supplemented by overseas borrowing at the rate of about ?30 millions per annum. This borrowed money provided employment for somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000 men. This source of income having dried up, these* men and those who were occupied in pro viding for their needs have been thrown out of employ ment. There is no device by which the loss of income represented by decreased value of exports and cessation of overseas loans can be made up except that of increased production. Currency inflation will not do it. Currency inflation provides a means by which fixed incomes from wages, salaries, pensions and interest can be reduced without any nominal reduction?a sort of confidence-trick?but currency 40</page><page sequence="6">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June, 1931, Economics and Politics inflation is disastrous to the exporter because it forces him to work at costs which he cannot recover in his price. The deficiencies in total income resulting from de creased value of exports and cessation of loans can only be made good by increased production. The direction in which this increase must be sought is determined by our overseas obligations for interest and services. For some years past these obligations have been met in effect by fresh borrowings. In any case this could not have continued in definitely; but the market became unfavorable and this method of payment ceased. It is unlikely that it can be resumed on the same scale. England was the cheapest lender because she was willing to accept Australian Bonds as trustee securities. Whether she will do so again in view of Mr. Lang's gesture remains to be seen. In any event, she vhas not the lending capacity she had aforetime. The most we can hope to do in the near future is to fund the floating liabilities; we cannot expect to be able to borrow money to pay current liabilities; therefore, if we are to pay our way?and every Australian agrees we should do so?we can only do it by creating a surplus of exportst over imports sufficient for this purpose. Although there has been a large increase in, our manu factures it has been achieved at costs which prevent ex portation. The burden of providing the means of paying overseas obligations is thrown on to primary production. We can relate therefore the problem of re-employing the men thrown out of work through the cessation of over seas borrowing with the problem of increasing our primary production. There are, of course, difficulties in the way of accomplishing this. That of transferring a large num ber of city workers to primary industries (except mining) is the first which comes to mind. Also the capacity of the overseas market to absorb the increased production. But there are other obstacles. Some of the increase in our rural production has been on unsound lines. Wheat 41</page><page sequence="7">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June, 1931. Economics and Politics has been pushed into the dry areas. Where yields are so low and uncertain as to be profitable at little less than scarcity prices, these areas must revert to grass, and some will have to be abandoned altogether. The position in re gard to dried fruits, canned fruit, Dorodilla grapes has been unsatisfactory for some time. How long Australia can afford to pay for the privilege of exporting sugar is a vexed question. The main difficulty, however, is costs of production. It is idle to think that men can be got back to work without adjusting internal costs so that the export indus tries can function profitably at world's prices. A few years back there was a plan whereby export in dustries were to be subsidised out of income provided by manufactures operating under the shelter of a high tariff, which in effect meant subsidised out of income provided by the export industries. So long as wool and wheat were able to pay their share of the subsidy to manufactures without receiving anything in return, and so long as over seas borrowings were supplementing income, the scheme seemed to work; but its folly is now apparent. As Professor Shann says in his "Economic History", the subsidising of exports deranges the whole economy if it forces production at costs which the outer -world is under no obligation to meet. If export production can not be undertaken at costs which are profitable at world's prices, primary production will have to be curtailed to the quantity required for home consumption plus whatever pro duction can be exported profitably because of some specially favorable circumstances. Such a contraction of production will mean that Australia will have to lose population and lower her standard of living to a far greater extent than will be necessary if she seeks the rehabilitation of her export industries through lower costs. 42</page><page sequence="8">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June, 1931. Economics and Politics The correlated problems of re-employing surplus popu lation and paying our overseas obligations resolve them selves into the problem of reducing costs of production. Any remedy for our present distress is insufficient if it does not deal with this problem and is positively dangerous if it jeopardises our future capacity to expand our export pro duction to meet overseas obligations. There is a tendency to over-estimate what Governments can do to help in this direction, and to lean too much on them. It is the people and the people only who can increase the national income. We not only flatter the politicians too much, but delude ourselves if we think they can help us in any other direction than by balancing budgets, and releasing industry from restrictions which hamper produc tion. The question of reducing costs is not simply a question of Government or Arbitration Court action. Reduction of Government expenditure is probably the most important single factor at the present time; but equally important is the cumulative effect of individual effort. The reverse of the vicious circle will operate if each does his bit. Unfortunately we all of us seem to place a pathetic reliance on Governments to do things which we ought to do ourselves. Even the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, hitherto a severe critic of Government interference with trade, has recently been asking the Victorian Government to guaran tee a private loan to provide relief for farmers. As regards those farmers who have a chance of re covery, it is the business of those who have advanced money or supplied goods on credit to see them through the de pression and so enable them to pay their debts. This is being done to a much larger extent than perhaps we realise and is a reasonable business risk. Hopeless cases?men 11* 43</page><page sequence="9">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June. 1931, Economics and Politics who have taken up dry areas where yields are uncertain and only profitable at scarcity prices?men who have no chance of recovery; these are proper subjects of Govern ment assistance, purely as a salvage operation, to help them off their lands and to give them sustenance until they can get a fresh start. To try to keep them on their land is to throw good money after bad; and the cost of helping them to re-employment should be defrayed from revenue and not from loans. There is rearaanger in these schemes for Government guarantee of risks, or such things as bonuses on gold, guar anteed price of wheat and the like. If the government can properly be asked to guarantee against risks of loss, is it not a logical step that a Government should claim a right to profits and is not this a logical step to nationalisation of industry which is Sovietism ? Moreover, such reliance on Government aid weakens enterprise and initiative, which more than anything else are required at a time like this. The Government can help to reduce costs by reducing Government expenditure and removing restrictions on en terprise. The rest depends on the people of Australia. Each of us has the particular part he can play, and to play it effectively each must get it out of his head that any Government, even if the Angel Gabriel were at the head of it, could relieve him of this responsibility. In saying this I am not minimising the importance?the vital importance? of Government action in the directions indicated. But it is only one phase of the problem and, by itself, is insufficient. If we keep clearly in our minds the fundamental fac tors of income?that income depends on production of goods, tangible or intangible; that we cannot get out of export goods more than the world is willing to pay for them; that subsidies on exports or assistance to local manufactures by tariffs are only practicable at a cost to other industries and 44</page><page sequence="10">The Australian Quarterly, 15th June, 1931 Economics and Politics are only justifiable if their cost is less than their benefit to the community as a whole; that additions to income through social services are not in themselves additions to total income, although of course they may lead to them; that the economic activities of Governments are largely spending other people's money and not additions to total income. If we keep these truisms in our minds we will be able to assess the rival claims of politicians and others in a rational way; and, what is more, will be helped in making our own practical and effective contribution to the solution of the problem. 45</page></plain_text>
