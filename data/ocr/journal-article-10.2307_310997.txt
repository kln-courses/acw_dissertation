<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRIEDLAENDER HYDRIA JOHN GRIFFITHS PEDLEY THE Greek black-figure hydria (pl. I)1 bearing on the body the familiar empaneled scene of Herakles' struggle with Triton or Nereus or The Old Man of the Sea (Brommer's2 neutral term "Meer- wesen" is perhaps appropriate) was purchased on the New York market on 7 April 1962. Presently in the possession of Mr. Jonathan Scott Friedlaender of Cambridge, Massachusetts, the hydria was on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of New York from 3 May 1966 to 2 January 1968 and while in the care of the Metropolitan enjoyed a scrupulous cleaning and careful photography.3 At some point in its life, as is most readily visible in the profile view (pl. ii, i) and the view of the shoulder scene (pl. 11, 2), the hydria was broken. It was subse- quently repaired, and missing pieces4 were restored in plaster and repainted; since the cleaning undertaken by the Metropolitan Museum, the restored pieces are easily recognizable and the hydria will remain, it is hoped, in this condition. In spite of the catastrophe that overtook the vessel at one point in its life, it is almost totally preserved:5 both the painted scenes and the full contour of the shape retain their pristine vigor. The glaze is uneven, varying from highly vitreous (on the neck) to a motley stringiness beneath the body scene. Wide mouth, wide brim, and rounded lip are all features characteristic of the "catcher" hydria; from beneath the lip the neck falls in concave 1I should like to express my appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Friedlaender for permission to publish this hydria, and to Dr. Dietrich von Bothmer from whose knowledge, advice, and criticism I have greatly benefited. 2 F.

The curved back handle reaches above the uneven (in profile view) horizontal of the lip; metal- loid spurs at the join of handle and lip emphasize the influence exerted on potters by bronze casters in the sixth century. This is already evident in the wide brim and depressed shoulder, for no sixth-century bronze hydria known to me has narrow rim and arching domed shoulder.6 The rounded side handles jut upward and outward from immediately below the carination at the junction of shoulder and body. While the profile from neck to shoulder has been reversed, from shoulder to body it continues the full swelling convex line. The foot is the plain black torus usual in hydrias of the later sixth century,7 separated from the body by a fillet c. i cm. high. On the underside of the foot an inscription of two letters is incised: a three-barred sigma and an omicron. The commercial significance of these inscriptions has been exhaustively examined by Rudolf Hackl.8 In sum, the body is plump and sturdy, the shoulder flattened but still curved, the neck squat but trumpet-like. These are not the attenuated and slimmer potting proportions of hydrias popular at the end of the sixth century,9 but conform rather to an earlier standard - a standard that admittedly was manneristically revivified by a few potters in the final decade of the century.x0 For the decoration, the usual scheme of black and red tongues appears above the shoulder picture; though normally this pattern is restricted to the area directly above the shoulder scene, here, as oc- casionally, the motif continues the whole way round the hydria. Plain vertical lines bound either side the shoulder picture, but the painter, typically, has not painted his black glaze quite up to these thin lines. A horizontal black line articulates the broken rhythm of the profile at the junction of shoulder and body and divides the shoulder scene from the panel on the body. A ground line forms the base of the principal picture, though, again typically, the glaze painter has not brought his 6 For examples of sixth-century bronze hydrias and the formal development of the hydria in Greece, see E.

Uncustomarily, the branches are not represented by straight vertical lines, but by lines that wriggle their way up the hydria between the stems and leaves. At the base, upward pointing rays encircle the vessel. The width of the scene on the shoulder is the same as that of the scene on the body; this is not always the case."1 Depicted are five figures, of which the central one is attempting to prevent two warriors from coming to grips: thus, an arm and a hand are extended in supplica- tion to each. A separated combat, then.12 Flanking the central trio, single figures stand either side. The flanking figures wear chitons and cloaks: carrying spears, they stand in histrionic attitudes, extending their right arms toward the combat as much to direct the attention of the viewer as to express any emotional involvement of their own. The heroes wear crested Corinthian helmets and the "muscle" cuirass,13 and they carry Boeotian shields.'4 They stride purposefully toward one another and prepare to unleash their javelins. The central figure dividing the combatants, arms and legs outstretched, wears a striped tunic (probably red, though the color has now gone pale) and cloak spread over his arms. Unarmed, he is doubtless a herald. The emblem scarcely discernible on the shield of the warrior to the right is the thunderbolt, certainly as much decorative as apotropaic.15 The shield itself is of a type deliberately anachronistic, which evidently was used by artists to indicate that the scene portrayed belongs to the mythic past of the heroes. Actual sixth-century hoplite shields were larger, heavier, and round, and the Boeotian shield seems never to have really existed in the sixth century, in spite of the evidence for a pre- cursor furnished by Geometric pottery'6 and the well-known Karditsa warrior.17 The scene is one of the generic archaic kind, the sort which by the 11 Cf., e.g., Beazley (above, n. 9), pls. 36, 2; 39, i, 3; 40. 12 For more animated separated combats see F.

The Iliad (7.273-282) gives particulars that I believe are appropriate for this picture. Hector battles Ajax, and the struggle is interrupted by the heralds, Idaios and Talthybios, for whom one, Idaios, speaks. Though details do not all match,19 the identification of the shoulder scene of the Friedlaender hydria with this duel seems possible.20 In contrast to the separated combat of the shoulder scene, the panel on the body of the hydria depicts a combat joined: the struggle between Herakles, easily identifiable by his attribute, and a sea monster.21 The identity of this sea monster has been as puzzling to modern schol- ars22 as it was protean in antiquity. It seems that, even among artists of the sixth century, no single view prevailed: inscriptions reveal that to some the sea monster wrestling with Herakles was The Old Man of the Sea,23 to others Triton,24 and to others Nereus.25 No ancient is G. M. A. Hanfmann, "Narration in Greek Art," AJA 61 (i957) 71-78. 19 E.g., the Homeric heroes are about to attack one another with swords, not spears, at the point when Idaios intervenes. 20 The duel between Ajax and Hector was portrayed on one of the panels of the chest of Kypselos (Pausanias 5.19.2). There the heroes were separated pictorially (we assume) by a personification of Eris, whose function, obviously and in contrast to that of the herald of the Friedlaender hydria, was to draw the contestants together.

Shoulder.</page><page sequence="7">The Friedlaender Hydria 49 literary source mentions a struggle between Herakles and Triton. Yet the tradition of a struggle between Herakles and Nereus, most fully preserved in Apollodoros (Bibliotheca 2.5.1 I) can be traced through Pherekydes somewhat tenuously to Stesichoros in the mid-sixth century.26 In Homer Nereus never appears, and Hesiod (Theogony 234, 1oo3) is the first to mention him, identifying him, at that, as The Old Man of the Sea (or at any rate as an old man of the sea). It may be possible, then, to equate Nereus with The Old Man of the Sea as early as the sixth century and say that the story of his struggle with Herakles was current at that time.27 Yet the epigraphic evidence of the vases is against this: on the grounds of a simple arithmetical count of in- scriptions identifying the sea monster wrestling with Herakles on preserved sixth-century vases, I prefer to identify the merman as Triton, and refer to him as such on the Friedlaender hydria. Herakles facing right sits astride and atop Triton with his right arm coming over Triton's right shoulder and his left beneath Triton's left armpit, holding the merman in an apparently painless variation of the half nelson. His hands are locked firmly together, and Triton strives in vain to break this grip, both his arms akimbo tugging at Herakles' wrists. Herakles wears a striped tunic, similar to the garb of the herald in the shoulder scene, most of which is hidden with Hera- kles himself behind Triton's body. Added red was used for Herakles' hair and beard. Triton's marine lower half snakes off to the left and is characterized, unusually, by appearing more to be a feline pelt than the Louvre F 298: CVA Louvre 6 III He pl. 72, 2 = Brommer, ibid., 114, no. 57.

I8 (from Samos). 26 Shepard (above, n. 21) 13. 27 In this view it would also be possible to equate all three, Triton, The Old Man of the Sea, and Nereus; or to say that Triton was another submarine deity concurrently popular with Nereus = The Old Man of the Sea. The old view articulated in Daremberg-Saglio (s.vv. Hercules, Triton), that all named sea deities, Proteus, Glaukos, Poseidon, Nereus, Triton, Phorkys, are derivatives from, or local and particular manifestations of, an ur-God, The Old Man of the Sea, is still tenable. There is little clarity; but there does seem to be a distinction between the literary record, which states unequivocally that it was Nereus with whom Herakles fought, and the evidence of the monuments. The pot painters, and perhaps by extension the sculptors of the pedimental groups on the Athenian acropolis and at Assos, seem to have preferred to identify the sea monster whom Herakles wrestled as Triton.</page><page sequence="8">50 John Griffiths Pedley scaly surface of a submarine dweller. Though the artist began in scale pattern for a single register below the pectoral on the left, he quickly changed to hairy pelt-like parallel incisions, similar in technique to the shaggy lion's mane that Herakles wears. Triton's belly stripe was originally white, and his face and neck painted in the old-fashioned added red.28 Hair, beard, and moustache are all articulated differ- ently, though a hemispherical bathing cap hides most of Triton's crown. Two pairs of figures flank the central scene, and of these the two on the right are recognizable as Poseidon and Amphitrite by the trident which Poseidon carries; Amphitrite, wearing checkerboard peplos, stands in front of her spouse. In no uncertainty about where their sympathy lies, Poseidon stares challengingly with pursed lips at Herakles as he holds his trident upright before him. The two figures to the left are less easy to identify: unlike Poseidon and Amphitrite, the man does not stand stock-still but, with outstretched hands and arms, steps toward the conflict. The drawing is untidy in this area: the man's right shoulder is confused with the left shoulder of his female companion so that it is not immediately clear which of the two is carrying the spear (scepter ?). This attribute is drawn closer to the viewer than the man's right arm, and in front of the woman's body. It seems that she must have been carrying the object in the hand of her bent right arm. The positioning of the feet might argue that these figures' support is for Herakles; in this event they provide an emotional foil to the antagonism of Poseidon and Amphitrite and may perhaps be identified as Athena and Hermes, longtime companions and associates of Herakles. Yet, in other representations of this struggle, Athena and Hermes are not the most frequent attendants, and there are here no preserved or discernible attributes by which Hermes may be identified: certainly the feet are unshod. And if Athena is Athena, she has left her aegis and helmet behind and carries a rather blunt spear.29 Frequently apparent among the surrounding figures in the pottery representations is an anthropomorphic Nereus, and this identification is made good by 28 On erythrology see H. R. W. Smith, "The Hearst Hydria," University of California Publications in Classical Archaeology, vol. I, no. io (1944) 241-290; and, for Tritonian and Heraklean obsolescence in this respect, esp. n. 36. 29 Bluntness of another kind is visible in Poseidon's trident: there the top of the barbs has vanished where the paint has disappeared. The same cause for lack of pointedness may not be considered for this object: the paint reaches almost up to the line marking the separation between body and shoulder, and there is no space for a further extension of it. This object, accordingly, was meant to be seen as a staff or scepter.</page><page sequence="9">The Friedlaender Hydria 5I inscriptions on two vessels.30 In these instances, Nereus appears as a white-haired old man, bearded and wearing a long chiton; he stands to the left and carries a staff or scepter. He does not gesticulate. It is just possible to make out that our (unfortunately largely headless) man had a beard: he wears a long chiton and in the excitement of the moment may perhaps be said to have handed his scepter over to his companion. Accordingly, I prefer to see this figure as Nereus; the female by his side will then be identifiable as Doris, his sister and wife. She, like Amphi- trite, wears the dotted checkerboard peplos;31 and, like Amphitrite, her face was originally painted in added white, as were some of the folds of their garments. There is no predella. In discussions of the development of Greek vase shapes it is custom- ary to talk of a movement from heavy and massive forms to tall and slender; this "rule" holds true for the development of the hydria in the sixth century. The thick, ponderous forms of the Friedlaender hydria seem, then, to make this vessel no less akin formally to the round squat shapes of the Timagora hydrias32 than to the straight, elegant forms and lines of the hydrias of the last decade of the sixth century, where reduction of volumes, tightening of outlines, and increase of tensions are all exemplified.33 It might have been tempting to associate our hydria with the reintroduction of stouter34 norms in the closing years of the century, with the fuller silhouette and amplified volumes renewed by such potters as the Ring-Foot Potter and the Potter of the Hypsis Hydria. But the Friedlaender hydria does not demonstrate the same tightness of contour, does not have the same magnification and expansion of forms above the shoulder, and is heavier (if not broader) in the lower part of the body. In shape and proportions this hydria is close to a hydria said to be Andocidean and dated c. 520-510 B.C.35 But again there are differences: while lip and foot are similar, the curving outline of the Friedlaender hydria continues higher than the Andocidean, thus emphasizing the ovoid character of the design and betraying the round form from which 30 British Museum B 223: CVA British Museum 4 III He pl. 55, 2 = Brom- mer (above, n. 2) 112 no. 9.

In red-figure representations Nereus does not appear as fishtailed. 31 We are reminded, of course, of the amphora by Exekias (Vatican 344) where the female figure similarly wears the Doric peplos. 32 Cf., e.g., Louvre F 39: CVA Louvre 6 III He pl. 64, 1-3. 33 Cf., e.g., British Museum B 343: British Museum 6 III He pl. 94, 3. 34 Bloesch (above, n.

The body is not set off so sharply from the shoulder: the curve continues. Since the neck is squatter and the lip does not extend so far, the effect in the Friedlaender hydria is to concentrate our attention on the figured scene, overbalancing the proportions in favor of the squat and sturdy body. Proportions and shape, then, suggest a date prior to 520 B.c. The Friedlaender hydria is close, again, in shape to a hydria said to have been decorated by the Lysip- pides Painter or in his manner.36 Though again the shoulder is flatter and we should not be deceived by the close proximity of the absolute measurements,37 this hydria shows the same chunkiness of shape and heaviness of the lower body. Lip, neck, foot, curving flank handles, and back handle are also very like. The painting and incision that decorate the Friedlaender hydria, if less than masterly, are still effective. Lack of disciplined techniques is evident in the shoulder scene, where the incised lines delineating forms often reveal a summary treatment. Thus, uncontrolled scratches serve to outline anatomical forms (legs of the herald and arms of the heroes) and articles of clothing and armor (the attendants' cloaks, the heroes' cuirasses and shields). Though attention to detail, then, is cursory, the scene nevertheless communicates an air of urgency, more by pose and gesture and effective composition of balanced painted masses than anything else. The herald arrives in the nick of time. A distanced view of the paneled scene on the body is likewise more convincing than close scrutiny; but here more care has been exercised, and this was applied more willingly to the main characters than to the bystanders. Thus, though anatomical detail has not been pursued for the onlookers (e.g. legs and feet and female faces), considerable care was lavished on the heads, arms, and legs of the wrestling couple. Triton's hair appears in three distinct styles, and his muscularity is not demeaned; Herakles' head and the lion's mane are closely drawn. Compositionally crowded and iconographically conservative, the scene is effective largely because of its mythic narrative content presented here in the usual "mono-scenic " archaic manner.38 Too few details of anatomical forms are preserved for any attempt to associate this vessel with any known painter to be completely appropri- ate. While the shape is close to that of hydrias decorated by the Lysip- pides Painter or in his manner, the Lysippides Painter's drawing is far "I British Museum B 302: CVA British Museum 6 III He pl. 74, 3; 75, 3- 37 Hydria in the British Museum: H. 0.47 m.

Yet it is perhaps of some interest that, of seven hydrias identified by Beazley40 as being related to the Lysippides Painter, no less than four show as their body scene the match between Herakles and Triton. This speaks eloquently enough for the popularity of this theme in the decade c. 530-c. 520 B.C. Together with the potter's scale of proportions, this suggests that the painter of the Friedlaender hydria was active in the Kerameikos in that decade and was familiar with, if not close to, the work of those potters and painters related to the Lysippides Painter. Some details may suggest an earlier date: shape of the brim and the lack of predella scene could be regarded as earlyish traits, and a date for the making of the Friedlaender hydria c. 530 B.C. seems sound. The Friedlaender hydria, then, is no masterpiece. Its significance lies in that it stands chronologically toward the beginning of the series of late black-figure hydrias when the canon of proportions was still influenced by the ovoid shapes of the middle of the century. Some details are unusual: the black and red tongue pattern encircling the shoulder where neck and shoulder meet; the wavy line depicting the branch of the decorative ivy flanking the main scene; the reproduction of Triton's skin as shaggy hide rather than in scale pattern. For these details alone, the Friedlaender hydria is remarkable, and worthily takes its place alongside other sixth-century depictions of Triton's overthrow.
