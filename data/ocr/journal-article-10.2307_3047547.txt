<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS BENJAMIN ROWLAND, The Art and Architecture of India (The Pelican History of Art), Baltimore, Penguin Books, 1953. PP- 308; 190 pls. $8.50. Dr. Benjamin Rowland is Professor of Fine Arts at Harvard University. His new book is the first vol- ume to appear of the Pelican History of Art: a tre- mendous enterprise, which will run into forty-eight fine volumes, lavishly illustrated (in monochrome only, it seems, unless other volumes will be better equipped), well printed and attractively bound. To my knowledge it is the most extensive history of the world's art ever to be published, much larger than the richest compara- ble German publication; and the more the pity that Asia is, as always in these world art histories, repre- sented only in a most stepmotherly manner. But that is not all. The volume under review contains not only the history of art in India, but also the art of no less than seven other countries, namely Nepal, Tibet, Cey- lon, Cambodia, Siam, Burma, and Java-a truly enor- mous vista, of tens of thousands of miles, many thou- sands of years, and monuments running into, surely, a hundred thousand or more. Whereas this non-Indian material is included, simply because there were some Indian influences on these countries (by the same token Roman art could be treated as a chapter in the volume on Greek art), Dr. Rowland, to the astonishment of all Indian reviewers, excludes from the history of Indian art and architecture the whole of Indian Islamic art; not one of the great monuments of, say, the Mughals, are included, not even those that contain three-quarters of Hindu-Jain elements and only one quarter of Islamic; indeed, ac- cording to this strange book, the whole history of Indian architecture suddenly stops with the arrival of Islamic influences. Neither is there a single word in this volume about the miniature painting of the courts at Agra, Delhi, and Lahore, the subordinate Muslim principalities of, say, Hyderabad, Deccan, or Bijapur. Dr. Rowland is better and more reliable on sculpture and early architecture, which receive a far ampler and more adequate treatment than the later periods. In- deed, in many ways the first few chapters show that what he had studied most of all are the earliest monu- ments of the Buddhists, from the time of Asoka to the end of the Guptas. The author tries to explain Indian points of view by frequent references to the Indian theories of art contained in those ancient books on arts and crafts, the Sanskrit silpa-sastras. But this is a fatal mistake made by some European and American schol- ars. These books are all extremely late in date, and the great masterpieces of Indian art had been created long before theoreticians sat down to explain their "rules." Some temples may show these late influences, and yet an examination of these books will prove that the vast bulk of temples bears no resemblance at all to the pun- ditic regulations laid down by the silpa-sastra writers in the cabined atmosphere of their study. It is unkind perhaps to give a long list of actual howlers in Dr. Rowland's book. But it is the reviewer's duty to prove his contention that there are many mis- takes in this work, and here are a few, selected at random. We are told that Mathura is in the Punjab (p. 24). On page 94 we learn, no doubt on the authority of some silpa-sastra (not quoted) that "the body of Buddha is like that of a lion, the legs are like those of a gazelle, and on the soles of his feet appear two shin- ing wheels with a thousand spokes." All these details are cited by the author not as rank absurdities but as straightforward statements of fact, as if there were anywhere in the world a single image of the Buddha with the legs of a gazelle or with a wheel of a thousand spokes on his soles. We would, perhaps not unreasonably, expect a writer on Indian art to be fairly well acquainted with the basic tenets of India's religions. Dr. Rowland re- peats the frequently disproved statement that "Bud- dhism is essentially a pessimistic doctrine" (p. 3 I); and he refers to Maitreya as "included in primitive Buddhism." If the term primitive means the Buddhism preached by the Master and his immediate successors, the answer is that none of them have ever heard the very name of Maitreya. On page 164 we read: "it must be remembered that every work of Indian architecture, Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain, must first and foremost be regarded from its metaphysical aspect, that is, a kind of magic replica of some unseen region or sacred being; and that it was precisely this metaphysical factor that determined the plan and elevation, rather than any aesthetic or func- tional consideration." I declare that this is basically untrue, and that an art history proper cannot relegate functional and aes- thetic considerations to second and third place. All the mystic explanations of a Gothic cathedral will not assist one iota in the appreciation of its artistic and functional place in the history of art. The Buddhist stupa is sup- posed by later writers to be either a replica of heaven or of the world "egg," or even to be the architectural frame symbolizing the body of the Buddha, says Pro- fessor Rowland. But ultimately, it is clear that the stupa is a functional building, developed out of a funereal mound into which the ashes of a holy man were de- posited. Dr. Rowland himself admits this, for he says: "The completely undynamic character of stupa archi- tecture is thoroughly expressive of its function of en- closing and guarding the relic. ... ." (p. 52) One would like to ask what mystic symbolism, what magic explanation or religious tenet can explain the vast for- mal differences between various stupas, from Amara- vati and Jaggayyapeta to the strange Tibetan ones, or from the Gandhara stupas to those of Central India? If these symbolic, punditic explanations of the mystic meaning of all parts governed the architecture of the Hindu temple, how is it that, purely aesthetically speak-</page><page sequence="2">144 THE ART BULLETIN ing, they vary so enormously, and that a temple of the Gupta times, such as the magnificent little shrine near the Sanchi stupa, differs more from a temple of Orissa in the eighth century than a Greek temple differs from a Gothic church? What explains the admirable inven- tion of Buddhist railings and torans: functionally evolved railings, out of wooden structures, no doubt, but endowed in later days with a beauty and a decora- tive coat that no amount of silpa-sastrism can talk away. The task of an art historian is to lead his readers to Form, and to reveal to them the contents and the feelings behind that Form. For this purpose he has every right to make use of the texts at his disposal: but they should be handmaids, in the service of aesthetic judgments. Religious conceptions are not aesthetic judgments. Dr. Rowland tells us on page 77 that the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang "found that country in a ruinous, depopulated state, with most of the Buddhist establish- ments in a state of complete decay." But on page 9 1 he assures us that nothing of the kind had happened. Here we read: "There seems no reason to believe that the Buddhist establishments . . . came to an end. The testimony of the Chinese pilgrims, Fa Hsien and Hsuan Tsang, informs us that the monasteries continued to flourish for centuries after." A similar contradiction is found in a paragraph on page io9. Describing a figure in Bamiyan, the author writes: "The completely Indian female figure . .." and seven lines below he continues: "This style in Bamiyan cannot be described as purely Indian because The oddest of these contradictions is on page I 23, where Andhra art again appears as "purely" Indian; and this is contrasted with Kushan art (earlier de- scribed under Mathura as "completely" Indian): "A purely Indian tradition [i.e. in Andhra] appears to have been stronger and less affected by foreign influ- ences than it was in the territories of the Kushans." (p. 123) The last few quotations must have convinced the reader that Dr. Rowland never reread his manuscript carefully. What worries the reviewer most, however, is the ease with which such sweeping adjectives are used by an earnest scholar, e.g. "completely Indian," "com- pletely undynamic," "literally scores of stupas" (what does this mean?), "a literally gigantic stone"; to the author every relationship is "close"; and we have on page 143 the unfortunate expression "enormously monumental." Some of Dr. Rowland's statements are based on nothing but imagination. To say that "Sanskrit became the official language of the Gupta court" (p. 130) is to say that Sanskrit was not, previously, the language of courts; which is patently untrue. It had been so for a thousand years at least. And to speak of music at the Gupta court as if one knew anything about it, is objectionable. Nothing, not a single note of music survives from that period, or, for that matter, of the music of India a thousand years after the Guptas. When we come to the author's aesthetic judgments, we must, first of all protest against the misleading title of Part Two, "The Early Classical Periods." This in- cludes the entire history of Indian art from the most archaic sculpture in the third century s.c. through the Mauryas, Sungas, and Andhras, up to the beginnings of the art of Gandhara and Mathura, which are treated in Chapter Three. If the earliest periods are called "early classical," I would like to know what would be properly called archaic? Why should we depart from the common nomenclature of art history, and give a misleading impression to the reader that these utterly archaic times, when frontality, symmetry, clumsy drawing, lack of verity, stiff immobility and lifeless- ness characterized India's archaic art (as elsewhere); why, I repeat, should we give the misleading impres- sion that these partook somehow of the classical style? It is true that during a period of some four hundred years the archaic character gives way, slowly, to more skillful drawing and a more profound understanding of composition: but then this is precisely the same as in every archaic art, a growth towards that "conquest of realism" which becomes the inherited tool of the classi- cal artist. At the other end of the classical Gupta times, too, Dr. Rowland fights shy of employing the proper art historic terms. He refers, here and there, hesitatingly, to the "baroque character" of some piece of sculpture or architecture; but he does not call the period by its proper name, viz. Baroque Period. On page 163 he excuses himself, allowing that this "is much more ap- propriate" a term; but the chapters dealing with Gupta art are not termed "classical," and the art in the eighth and subsequent centuries are not called "baroque" by the author. The result of this thinking is marked in many an aesthetic judgment. Talking of Cave xix at Ajanta, Dr. Rowland correctly observes how richly carved this "cathedral" is. "The enormous elaboration of the stupa, as well as the decoration of the nave, is the direct re- sult of the development of Mahayana Buddhism, with its emphasis on the anthropomorphic nature of the Buddha; the multiple Buddha images are undoubtedly symbolical of the myriad Buddhas of the Quarters mentioned in the Saddharma Pundarika, just as the stupa itself is reminiscent of the fantastic miraculous structures described in the pages of this sutra." (p. 131 ) Now the point about this interesting connection is that one cannot derive the style of the temple from the literary style of the age and all its beliefs, and maintain that one is the "direct result" of the other. Had the author faced the fact that we have to deal with a baroque period, it would have been instantly clear that both the literary richness, overelaboration, exaggeration and wild, surprising fantasy, and the architectural richness, overelaboration, exaggeration and wild, surprising fantasy spring from the same source: the baroque love of the romantic, the novel, the overdrawn, the exaggerated, overdecorated in every aspect of life. It seems to me that the author was greatly handi- capped in his work by a lack of fresh and frequent</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 145 contact with India. That he himself feels this oc- casionally, is revealed by the fact that he finds himself unable to date Gandhara art, or to recognize its real character and development-though he devotes far more space to it than the proportions of the book de- manded. He says on page 78: "The art of Gandhara is not in any way a continuation of this indigenous tradition (viz. of Maurya, Sunga and Andhra art)." Yet, on the next page, we read: "Like all Gandhara primitives, its [Kanishka's relic casket] style is a mix- ture of archaic formulae of the early Indian school combined with iconographical borrowings from the West .... Dr. Rowland then proceeds to restate the old be- lief that the best specimens of Graeco-Roman-Gan- dharan art are those most thoroughly influenced by Hellenistic elements, and the moment Indianization takes place, the art becomes less good: an outstanding example of how even such a great scholar as Dr. Foucher was swayed by racial and geographical prej- udices ("all that is near to the Greek is good-all that departs from this our ideal is bad"). But Dr. Foucher learned his Gandhara in the last years of the last century and the beginnings of this one, fifty years ago. Dr. Rowland, writing in 1953, might have taken notice of recent writings in which the exact opposite is propounded: that Gandharan art, as all regional art, partook of the general development of Indian art from archaic times, and the best specimens are those that correspond to the Gupta period; those romantic and baroque stuccos of the fifth to seventh centuries that are no longer classical in feeling, but correspond perfectly in stylistic background to the contemporary baroque everywhere else in India, late Ajanta, Nalanda, etc. It remains to praise Dr. Rowland's choice of illus- trations, which, on the whole, are excellent though somewhat orthodox. There are a few oddities, such as figures 20 and 21 which are two prints of exactly the same gateway from the same angle, and some temples so similar that two or more pictures were hardly needed (plate o103). But I have left my greatest grievance to the end. Dr. Rowland's large tome dismisses the entire history of painting in this great country from the seventh century A.D. to the nineteenth-a period of twelve hundred years-in six and a half pages. What one regrets most of all is that so fine an op- portunity will not readily come again to incorporate an adequate treatment of Indian art into the history of the world's art. CHARLES L.
