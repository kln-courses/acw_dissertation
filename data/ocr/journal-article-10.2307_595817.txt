<plain_text><page sequence="1">INDIA AND KROEBER'S CONFIGURATIONS OF CULTURE GROWTH * LUCIAN SCHERMAN HANSON, MASSACHUSETTS KROEBER has gathered his material from history and has cast it in a sociological mold by means of the anthropological method. He is the master of his task as an anthropologist; he exhibits the culture-historical aspect of his subject, and dis- criminates quite clearly between his investigations and those of a historian like Eduard Meyer. He considers culture in its relation to history, whereas the historian appraises historical events as a re- flection of culture. For Kroeber, culture is 'a generalized abstraction'; the individual passes into the background (5). He is left to the psychologist, who employs culture only as an aid in the delineation of the picture of the indi- vidual-a point of view which Kroeber regards as being quite as warranted as his own,1 which con- ceives individuals in their particular times and situations only as 'inevitable mechanisms or meas- ures of cultural expression' (10). Kroeber does not disavow 'individual superiority,' but he does * University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1944. x, 882 pp. $7.50. This review has been translated from the German ms. by James Gail Sheldon. [See also the review of this book by G. L. Della Vida on p. 207 of this issue.-ED.] 1Let me take advantage of this tolerance and indi- cate briefly for the sake of a different point of view my own conviction that every significant progressive or retrograde step in culture receives its initial impulse from individuals, not from the profanum vulgus. That may sound like the language of an anti-democrat, but viewed more closely, it wears quite the contrary aspect. Such an individual only attains to power by drawing his life's blood from the people,-or better expressed: by merging his spirit into the soul of the people. Only then does his own action and thought synchronize with that of the masses. It is here that the most hetero- geneous occurrences have their source: elections and revolutions, the wrath of tyranny and humane legisla- tion. Everywhere there is the same motivation arising from the power of suggestion which issues from those persons who have worked themselves up through de- mocracy, i.e. through the 'power of the people' whose instincts constitute grist for their mills. A vexatious question is the obligations of present-day culture toward the intellectuals and toward the unsophisticated common people; cf. Rostovtzeff and Huizinga in the latter's Wege der Kulturgeschichte 46 (1930). not see in it the cause of 'cultural superiority.' These causes are unknown, and Kroeber's book is meant to be 'an attempt to organize data so as to define the problem' (16). With commendable self-restraint he goes no farther than this: 'I deliberately refrain from any ultimate explana- tion' (19). The whole body of material is subdivided into philosophy, natural science, philology and art. Under philology Kroeber includes only linguistics, the general and comparative science of language; as for the drama and the remaining branches of literature, he reserves a special chapter for each. In the case of art, sculpture and painting are sepa- rated; as for music, no account is taken of India, nor of the Orient in general; perhaps the essay by Kwang-chi Wang, Musikalische Beziehungen zwi- schen China und dem Westen im Laufe der Jahrtausende, in Festschrift Paul Kahle 217-24 (1935), might make the author change his opinion. Architecture is as good as completely omitted; apparently Kroeber does not find con- genial the relationship between 'psychological im- pression ' and ' direct aesthetic impulse ': ' I retain the suspicion that a culture-historically intelligible history of architecture is yet to be written' (22 f.). For the above-mentioned subjects Kroeber un- folds in geographical order the 'quality-time con- figurations.' Following on the exposition of the separate parts comes the comparison; that is, first an analytic, empirical procedure, then a synthesis. Kroeber feels that not everything yields to the pressure of comparison; but he consoles himself about the deficiency of the method: 'After all, there are great similarities, and these must have significance, underneath the endless variability of particular historic expression' (21). To this designated task Kroeber devotes more than three-fourths of his book. By that time the display of material 'in a manner that is essen- tially descriptive' (761) has presumably schooled the reader sufficiently to enable him to comprehend a new grouping, The Growth of Nations (661- 758). In this part there is placed before him the 133</page><page sequence="2">SCIIERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth sum-total that has been reckoned up for the vari- ous culture-areas (Egypt, China, Japan, India, the Ancient Mediterranean, Islam, the Occident . . . America 2 . . Peripheral Europe, the Jews, the West as a Whole). Instead of the separate activi- ties (natural science, painting, etc.), there now appears the geographic-ethnic culture-whole in its historical course. The search for culture-histori- cal laws (759-846, with an inserted chapter on Spengler) forms the conclusion. It is a merit of the book that its author is able to understand other points of view and never makes a secret of the limited character of the results that he has obtained. From the abundant contents I have assembled a small part of that material which I venture to suppose will hold the main interest of persons con- cerned with or inclined toward Indology. The supplementary observations and the brief sugges- tions for alterations, which find a place in my re- view, are not intended as hair-splitting censure, but rather as receipts for the profit gained from the instructive perusal of the self-sacrificing work of the author. How do the lines run in the network of Indian culture as depicted by Kroeber? First he records a ' proto-historic or traditional period of flores- cence,' at the focus of which stands the name of Buddha; following upon this period, which begins about 500 B. c., there comes a second flowering- season constituted of the first twelve post-Chris- tian centuries. One can, he thinks, treat this entire period of time historically, however acutely one might be aware of the chronological uncer- tainty. About this chronological deficiency Kroeber has, as perhaps a dozen passages bear witness, no illusions. That he does not go back into the third pre- Christian millennium to the excavations which re- vealed the Indus Valley culture-these are given a passing mention (680, 789)-speaks well for Kroeber's critical differentiation. For there we are faced not, indeed, with the northwestern boundary of an Indian empire but rather with the ' The ancient American cultures have to be content with a very few pages (24 f., 281-3) because 'the facts are insufficiently clarified' (24). The wise and under- standable reserve of the specialist shines through here. Why is the ethnologist more courageous when gathering flowers in foreign climes? eastern fringe of the Near East. It is in this Near Eastern domain that we shall probably some day be able to find a place for the figure (with horns!), which has been alleged to be that of Siva supposedly in yoga-posture. To my knowledge reservations based on this line of argument have appeared in print only in an article by Winternitz, Indien und der Westen, Archiv Orientalni 7. 281 (1935). On the other hand, however, a genuine prelude to Indian history was staged in Mitanni (Asia Minor). Even if it only resembles the fugitive image on a screen still it bridges over the 'vast historic lacuna in our knowledge of more ancient India' (219). We would therefore have been gratified, if Kroeber had deemed it worthwhile to mention this Vedic culture of the 14th century B. c., which is the most ancient accessible to us. His demurrer on this point is no doubt on the same plane with the explicit declaration at the beginning of the chapter on Sanskrit Literature: 'I exclude all primarily religious writing: the Vedas, the Brahmanas and Upanishads,3 the Bud- dhist canon and works of edification; also phi- losophy' (477) and he says still more plainly that 'the Vedas are distinctly too meager to prefigure later India' (681). However reluctant I may be to do so, I must part company with the learned author here. I do not stand on the platform of the pan-Vedists who attempt to force Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Hinduism into the Procrustean bed of the Veda. Nonetheless, it is still my opinion that the great national Epics, for whose accommodation in world literature Kroeber prudently strives (478 ff., 771),4 bear on their brows the marks of the secularization and euhemerization of the Vedic mythology. The millennia did not pass the Indians by without leaving a trace; very much 'orthodoxy' has been timidly veiled or thrown overboard outright, but any historical reconstruction of the life of the human spirit in India, which leaves aside the Veda together with its mythic-mystic elements, weakens the girders in its framework. 'I would warn against repetition of the prevalent error which brackets the Upanisads as pantheistic (63 f.) ; theopantism would be the accurate term. 4Here one could reasonably have expected the author to single out from the mass of the Mahabharata the Bhagavadgita, which stands to this day as the Hindu Bible venerated by all. 134</page><page sequence="3">SCHERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth The same thing holds true for Zoroaster and the Avesta, when we consider the fact that Iranians and Indians had lived together or in close prox- imity from remote antiquity. Remarks such as those interspersed now and then (125, 529 f., 697 f., 811) would have been welcome in still more generous proportions, even if they only served to expunge Spengler's erroneous statement that 'in the Avestan beliefs there is not to be found one trait of Brahmanism' (Decline of the West, II. 235).5 What Kroeber has to say about Buddha and Buddhism is well considered (esp. 257 f.). But should one strew flowers before Buddha, his Jaina rival Mahavira, and Panini, that chief in the kingdom of linguistics, all in the same temple with Kapila, Susruta and Atreya? (Cf. 681, 62 f.; with the notable reservation on p. 682.) To the first three giants no one denies historicity, sinco those who reckoned themselves dissenters to the earthly life of Buddha could hardly count on any reinforcements today. For the philosophico-medi- cal trinity, on the other hand, with which one can confidently associate Bharata, the inventor of a theory of the drama, the considerations, as a result of which Jacobi declined to breathe into the figure of Kapila the breath of life, are all valid, mutatis mutandis.6 If Reinhold Miiller (JRAS 1932. 789 ff.) is right in bringing down to the period shortly before 700 A. D. the compilations going by the names of Susruta, Caraka, and Vagbhata, then it becomes more and more apparent that the trans- mission of the history of Indian science has been subjected to strong mythical infiltration. The simultaneity of the philosophico-religious zenith around 600 B. C. in China, India and Greece has often been emphasized. As for the frequently conjectured influences of India on Greece or vice versa and the bold notion of the incarnation of Lao-tse in Buddha,7 Kroeber maintains cautious reserve. Yet he does not abruptly dismiss the ob- vious question, whether this 'sixth-century simul- taneity ' might not, in view of 'similar phenomena 5 My citations are from the Special Edition, New York, Knopf, 1939, with two Indices; first issued 1926-8. The first German edition appeared in 1918-22, without index. 6 For the opposite opinion, cf. Winternitz, Gesch. d. ind. Lit. 3.499 (1922). Cf. H. Maspero, JA 205. 90 f., 106 f. (1934) and my remarks in F. W. Thomas Volume 242 (1939). of contemporaneousness elsewhere in history,' be elevated above the realm of contingency into 'some sort of system or order which we do not yet recog- nize' (85). Nevertheless, the decision is negative. 'The idea that there is an underlying factor or set of factors determining the cultural history of humanity as a whole being therefore shown not to hold, . . . this idea may presumably be assigned to the class of concepts which spring from the undemonstrated assumption or article of faith re- specting the "progress of humanity"' (88). Is this stones instead of bread? No, it is rather sensible candor. For Kroeber is by no means the enemy of mysticism, even though he may not com- pletely abandon himself to it. He believes in 'cul- tural energy,' whose mightiest expressions are the ' cultural patterns' with 'their individual unique- ness . . . and an inner coherence or organization which tends to push them on to fulfillment and exhaustion and sets them a limit.' This may smack of mysticism: 'I regret this, but cannot help it'; such interpretations force themselves upon anyone, whose interest in the nature of the phenomena will not allow itself to be curbed by the fear of mysticism (91). I may be permitted here to pass over to the sec- tion on the Indian drama, because proceeding from it we shall have opened up to us some re- warding perspectives. The development of the In- dian drama is noteworthy to Kroeber, because it maintained its position in splendid isolation throughout an astoundingly long period. By about the beginning of the Christian era the Greek and Roman drama was dead, and during more than a thousand years thereafter, 'the only drama of literary merit that grew up in the world was that of India' (417; cf. 772, 774). Kroeber proceeds directly to the 'actable literary text' and elimi- nates entirely from his discussion those pieces in which the 'religious element, or the merely spec- tacular, or song or music or dance, or pantomime predominates' (409). As a result everything com- monly regarded as precursory to the Indian drama is lost sight of, except for the brief mention of shadow-plays (420). Since this latter time- honored genre received not, indeed, its first im- petus, but at least decisive stimulation from Java, it is perfectly possible, considering the researches of Sylvain Levi, Liiders, and Pelliot, that the drama, springing up in the second century A.D. 135</page><page sequence="4">SCHERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth on Buddhist soil, embraced important transfor- mations deriving from circles outside the Indian national sphere. The Indo-Scythians in Mathura, ethnically a Turko-Iranian offshoot immigrant from Chinese Turkestan, appear to have per- formed important services for Sanskrit literature.8 If one describes these Sakas as 'barbarians,' then one must not think of the identification of 'bar- barians' and ' primitives ' so common in popular usage (nor of the '(semi-)primitives ' of Kroeber [255, 684]), but rather of the well-known mean- ing in a passage such as the one where Cicero speaks of India as 'Quae barbaria India vastior aut agrestior ?' The Indo-Scythians, a millennium and a half before Akbar, were already eclectics and men of the world, who hoped to reap profit from putting into circulation their coins bearing the likenesses of Greek, Iranian, Brahmanic and Buddhistic divine patrons. Their underlying motivation cannot properly be described as re- ligious indifference; the Saka-Kusana were spurred on by a cosmopolitan spirit of enterprise which casts in advance the shadow of the ostentatious and splendor-loving Gupta dynasts. At exactly the same time that the political horizon in the Panjab and in the area of the Ganges and Jumna was widening out, Indian colonists were busy farther south conquering by peaceful culture-crusades the regions of Indo- China and Indonesia-a process which may have begun already in the 3rd century B. C. Kroeber's remark that 'here Hindus set up kingdoms instead of seeping into functioning ones' (260) sounds too militaristic; 'conquests of culture rather than of the sword' (684) would have been more in conformity with the real situation. For the trans- Gangetic princes, with names ending in -varman according to Pallava usage, in all probability were not Hindus, but Hinduized Rajas. J. Ph. Vogel was quite right in adducing the parallel with the name Vasudeva, occurring towards the end of the genealogy after the exotic names of his prede- cessors, Kaniska, Vasiska and Huviska. An As suggested by Konow, Grundriss 49 (1920) and only partially modified by Keith, The Sanskrit Drama 69ff. (1924). That the Chinese plays first appearing in the 13th century received nourishment from 2nd cen- tury Turfan (Kroeber 448) is too rash a conjecture. New evidence for the reckoning of the gaka Kusana with the Sarmatians is adduced by Bachhofer, JAOS 61. 247 f. (1941). Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde van analogous gesture in the Iranian direction is the name Aspavarman, son of Indravarman, as one ' Commander-in-chief' was called in the 1st cen- tury A.D. (CHI I. 577 [1922]). As to Farther India, it was not a question of 'masses of transplanted colonists' (269) as Kroeber rightly emphasizes; it looks to me as if they had still not forgotten the practice employed in Mitanni (JAOS 63.258 f. [1943]). The Brahmans, sagacious in the handling of the so-called second (Ksatriya) caste even in Rigvedic times, were shrewd diplomats, who had no inten- tion of letting 'caste-free' Buddhism take the wind out of their sails.10 That Champa was 'purely Brahmanistic' until at least 1000 A.D. (263) I very much doubt, nor would I care to swear by the formula that 'in the main, Brahman religion and cult preceded in dominance on the mainland and tended to be superseded by Bud- dhism; the island development, the reverse' (269). The archeological line is now and then indistinct and new finds often alter the picture. Above and beyond all this, after the first flush of anger was past, the two faiths were glad to come to terms with each other. Harsa, the last ruler of northern India (606-647 A.D.) favored by fortune, dedi- cated temples to Siva and Buddha; the latter was placed among the incarnations (avatdra) of the god Visnu not long afterwards; in Java they hit Nederl.-Indie 74. 197 (1918). This passage is concerned with the prince Mulavarman in Borneo ca. 400 A. D., i. e. at the same time that the Champi kings bore such names. The element reappears through a whole millen- nium. The first of these rulers was Dharmamaharaja (this also was a princely title among the Pallavas) 6ri Bhadravarman I, whose reign ended in 413. Bhadra 'auspicious' and Bhadre?vara are names of giva; the meaning of Bhadravarman is thus 'having giva as pro- tector.' According to Maspero and Finot, Fan is the Chinese transcription of varman; cf. Georges Maspero, Le royaume de Champa 54, 63, 79 (1928). Maspero also calls this first dynasty 'hindoue ou hindouiste' (8). 10 Brahmans along with gramanas also appear in the Khotan region of Central Asia. One may deduce this from the passage cited by T. Burrow, The Language of the Kharosthi Documents from Chinese Turkestan 109 (1937) and Translation of the Kh. doc. 110 (1940). In connection with the story of colonization, I recall the borrowing of geographical names like Amaravati, Champa and Kamboja from the mother country, in a fashion analogous to the use of European names, e.g. Boston, Berlin, Syracuse, etc., etc., taken over by set- tlers in the Americas from the European homeland. Champa and Kamboja are familiar from the old Buddhist texts. 136</page><page sequence="5">SCHERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth upon the idea of adoring Buddha as the youngest brother of Siva; and the posthumous name giva- buddha, which was given to an east-Javan king about 1300 is the non plus ultra of reconciliation: Indian monism had triumphed! And in what lovely poetry does it clothe its tenets! A bilin- gual Kambojan inscription 1 (ca. 1200 A.D.) salutes the King of Trees (Sanskrit asvattha, Khmer mahavodhi), who has Brahma as root, Siva as trunk, and Visnu as branches. The whole tree is thus the unity and the singleness of true insight symbolized by the legend of the sacred fig-tree, under which Buddha attained Enlightenment (bodhi). This tree remained the symbol of the Perfected One throughout those centuries when the artist refrained from disturbing by crude earth-bound anthropomorphism the blessed peace of the Buddha who had passed into Nirvana. The Dravidas had a lion's share in the colonial endeavors; their accomplishments in art and literature have long been underestimated. A pre- Christian 'iva-phallus figure (Coomaraswamy, Geschichte d. ind. u. indones. Kunst [1927], fig. 66), the sculptures of Amaravati, and the stu- pendous architecture of the Seven Pagodas 12 show that they knew both how to appreciate the recog- nized standards of the North, and how to develop their own creative powers. In literature Sanskrit, which was the lingua franca of the learned just as Arabic, Greek, and Latin were in other times and places (82), spread in all directions with brilliant results. It constituted a bridge of steel between the literary work of North and South India. The mountain barrier of the Vindhyas was overcome and at that moment the self-evidence of the cul- tural hegemony of the Aryans in India became a fable convenue. To Tamil poetry, so deeply im- bued with ethical and religious fervor, one may now assign an age not less than that of the earliest Sanskrit drama. Kroeber's doubts have obviously been so deeply impregnated by the much deplored indefiniteness of Indian chronology, that for him 'the nature and content of this early South Indian civilization, and its time and geographic range, re- main hypothetical if not speculative' (681)-an 11 Cf. the instructive article of Coed&amp;s, 'Une nouvelle inscription du Phimanakas,' BEFEO 18, No. 9, pp. 9-12 (1918). 12 Parmentier, L'Art khmer primitif, 1. 237 (1927), mentions a Tamil stele of the 8th century in Takuapa on the west coast of Kamboja. altogether too summary scepticism (which is im- plicitly contradicted on pp. 256, 258). The par- ticipation of the South, eventually rising to dominance, in Kroeber's second culmination of philosophy (183) about 800 A. D. (Samikara's date is contested and is possibly earlier), is incon- ceivable without a fundamental and perduring interchange of all that had been previously achieved. There come easily to mind the some- what similar circumstances under which the Bud- dhist priests of India, China, and Tibet prepared their translations. The universities of Nalanda in the North and KiaicT in the South were the Ox- ford and Cambridge of India. This entire intel- lectual concurrence is not a centrifugal movement as in the Occident (cf. Kroeber's view, p. 82), but represents the union of the intellectual interests of these two great groups of people. As Kroeber correctly observes, not only did philosophies meet, but the 'civilizational wholes' did so as well. However, I do not see in this any development from the 'uninational' to the 'multinational'; quite the reverse-it lays the foundations for the national unity of India. Regarding the actual 'configurations' I can only make a few remarks, if I am not to trespass unduly upon the limits of space of the JAOS. Moreover, I have the impression that India, to whose civilization Kroeber attributes an 'un- usually abstruse cast' (684), does not offer a cornucopia of convenient data for comparison just ready and waiting to be poured out. In philosophy the contrast with China is accentuated; there the intimate and lasting amalgamation with religion is absent (77). But in India this always remained the substructure of philosophy and of the natural sciences, whereby the mutual hostility of the three disciplines customary in the West was prevented. If one measures the duration of periods, their heterogeneity is likewise evident. Kroeber takes for the date of the second growth in India-'the Earlier Hindu philosophy is too dateless to be used here' (79)-the period from 100-1000 A. D., and proposes to divide it into two parts, 100-500 and 600-1000 (66 f.). The caesura thus pro- duced would not appear quite so precarious, if he had made use of the Hun intermezzo between the early and late Guptas to justify it; but to give such weight to political events agrees ill with 137</page><page sequence="6">SCHERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth Kroeber's methodological premises (19f.).18 Be- sides, India would even then remain an exception in the 'duration of productive growths' (79); at pp. 804-7, in his summary view of all the branches of culture, Kroeber tries to polish off the rough places;14 but 'there may be two pulses, and the entire chronology is somewhat conjectural '-or so he resignedly concludes (809), and the up-beat at the opening of the section on philosophy is this: ' When a culture operates in this fashion, the his- torian's task is difficult' (66). The table on philology is not much more than 'a table of diffusion . . . of a culture method or pattern' (235); Indian, Greek, Latin, and Chi- nese philology lead the dance. Panini, as we have already seen, gets some well-deserved adulation, since 'he is probably the greatest name in phi- lology'; even Greece stands at one side (217f., 232 f.).15 I do not believe that there is much to fear from the 'usual uncertainty of Indian dates' here. It may be remarkable aside that just 99 years ago Rudolf Roth published some unusually well-thought out estimates on the relative chron- ology of the Veda, Panini, the Mahabharata, etc. Sculpture in India does not have any grand climax, as it does in Greece and Italy, but sus- tains itself over long periods of time with alter- nate crests and troughs, as in Egypt (255). In the 5th century (Gupta Period) the high point seems to be reached; but in reality from the 3rd century B. c. until the 15th century A.D. impos- ing achievements were continually being made 18 At p. 210 f., 697 f., he concedes to historical events a greater importance. F. W. Thomas is right in stating that "it is clearly no accident that the finest classical literature belongs to the period of the Guptas and their successors, when the Indians were politically under their own control" (Indianism and Its Expansion 33 (1942) ). As is well known, the same can be said of the finest works of Indian art. 1' That the long duration of the cultural growth might perhaps be capable of explanation or even of reduction, if one brought into the picture the indifference of the Indians toward historical description and their accom- panying passion for exaggeration, I regard as far- fetched. Whether the Indians have or have not a sense of history has no bearing whatever upon the facts of the history. 16At p. 233, H. T. Colebrooke deserves to be men- tioned beside Sir William Jones. His Panini studies form a transition to Bohtlingk. As to Sanskrit rhyme, it is not necessary to fall back on foreign origin (479 in contrast to 617); cf. Winternitz, Gesch. d. ind. Lit. 3. 239 (1922). (260).16 As to colonial Indian sculpture, Kroeber has very skillfully compressed his account into nine pages (260-9; cf. 310, 776 f.). For Siam he changed pilots at the last minute and committed himself to Le May's expert guidance (Concise History of Buddhist Art in Siam, 1938). Su- matra 17 he treats with excessive brevity (261, 1"In the summary of achievements in sculpture, the juxtaposition of India and China (316) might easily lead to inadvertent disregard of the enormous initial advantage possessed by the Chinese in their antique bronzes, which stand at the head of Kroeber's list (675) under the date '1500 or earlier.' Indo-China and Indo- nesia also had exquisite bronzes; the statement that the 'recorded attainments are notable only in sculpture and architecture, through preservation of work in stone' (812) requires this supplementary word (for which the support lies close at hand in the bibliography, 852 ff.). I add here a few observations in connection with p. 255 f. The attention of the users of Kroeber's bibliog- raphy should be called to the important and profusely illustrated works by Vogel and Bachhofer.-To speak of a first Buddha or Bodhisattva representation 'dated 80 A.D.' is somewhat sanguine; the figure for the year must be obtained by conversion from Kaniska's regnal period, and there the uncertainty begins. The majority of scholars hold it more probable that the starting point was some forty years later than 78 A. D. True, F. W. Thomas in an ingenious article, New Ind. Ant. 7. 81 ff. (1944), breaks a lance anew for Kaniska's initiating the ~aka era. His point of departure to which he often returns is the Periplus, 'a work of c. 80 A.D.'; I may remark that this is the usual date, but Kornemann, Festschrift Lehmann-Haupt 59 (1921) came to the conclusion that the Periplus was written between 87 and 105, probably in the last years of Domitian (81-96). The first Brahmanic and Buddhistic school of sculp- ture comes before the Gupta era; one need only think of the many-sided artistic life in the busy city of Mathura (cf. HJAS 8. 232 [1944]).--Gandharan art, notwithstanding its significance, does not merit the epithet 'vigorous'; the enrichment of our knowledge of art supplied by the Hadda finds should have been men- tioned together with Gandhara, in spite of the pretexts on p. 260.-Neither the four-armed fiva nor the Buddha nimbus is an innovation of Gupta times; for the former (coins of Kaniska!), cf. Coomaraswamy, Gesch. d. ind. Kunst 75 (1927); on the nimbus, cf. Winternitz, Gesch. d. ind. Lit. 3. 179, 182 (1922). The many-headed images appear to me as an 'enrichment' of Buddhist iconogra- phy by means of miraculous narrative from the Mahayana with yoga-wrappings; cf. similar remarks on this point in A. M. Hocart, 'Many-armed Gods,' Acta Orientalia 7. 91-6 (1929).-That the Thai are less 'saturated with Brahmanical culture' is to be explained by their predominantly Chinese cultural basis. In China Indian religion is almost synonymous with Buddhism. The Vedanta gained adherents only relatively late; cf. JAOS 59. 278 ff. (1939). 17 To another and neighboring province of Indian cul- 138</page><page sequence="7">SCHERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth 267); the history of ;rrivijaya, which ran its course there, has left behind monuments of art of which Kroeber can judge by consulting, e.g. Heine-Geldern's Sumatra (1935). There it is re- called that the AmaravatI style (5th and 6th cen- turies) was replaced in the 7th century by Pallava influence; and indigenous Sumatran style made its own contribution. 'Farther and East Indian sculptures,' says Kroeber, 'were wholly derivative from India; but except for the final Javanese phase, each developed a true style of its own on the spot, almost certainly in the hands of natives' (269). Is the beginning of this sentence in agree- ment with its end? And is it really at all intel- ligible that 'primitive18 Chams and Khmers [were] producing vigorous sculpture after two or three centuries of Hindu tutelage' (782)? Be- ginning in the 3rd century the Chinese-never too easily impressed in artistic matters-reported of the people of Funan (South Kamboja) that they cast and engraved metals and carved in wood and ivory. This is a talent atavique as George Groslier says. In his admirable essays (Arts et Archeologie khmers, Tome II, No. 2-3, 1925-6), he carefully distinguishes what is native and what is borrowed in Kambojan art, and carries through in a convincing way his plan for separating out the art of the pre-Khmer or primitive Khmer period (4th and 5th centuries) from the statue type of the 6th to the 8th centuries. It is in the latter that we find the high cylindrical mitre which later completely disappears and is probably not wholly to be explained as a borrowing from tural influence Kroeber has called attention in his use- ful manual, Peoples of the Philippines2, Amer. Mus. of Nat. Hist. 14 if., 211 f., 228 (1943). Kalidas Nag, The People and Culture of the Philippines, Calcutta Review Nov. 1939, 182-92, aside from its phantastic flights into prehistory, contains many useful items about the cul- tural and commercial connections between the Philip- pines and India, China, Siam, and the South Seas. The Philippine Census of 1918 records 740 Buddhists. Bosch, Oudheidkundig Verslag Ned. Indi6 1920, p. 101 f., reports the unique find of two images, a iiva in copper (8 cm.) and a goddess in gold, perhaps Bud- dhistic (15 cm.), discovered the one on the island of Sibu, the other near the city of Esperanza (Mindanao). I learn from my friend Professor v. Heine-Geldern that the female figure is now in the Field Museum, Chicago. 18 These old Chams were not primitive; the ' imagerie de sauvages' (Parmentier, Ars Asiatica 4.19 [1922]) is the 'progress' of modern times-the well-known de- generation too often left out of consideration in ethnology. Mavallipuram. Finally Groslier gives a place in his arrangement to the new elements gradually appearing in the 9th century. The 'great family of Indian or Indianized Schools of Art' (B. K. Chatterji, Indian Cultural Influence in Cambodia, 1928, p. 76, where Groslier's point of view is not fully appreciated) does not suffer any laceration of vital nerves in such a system; it is only that thereby the ancient and indigenous tradition, which is usually passed over too lightly, now comes into its own.19 Kroeber's remark that 'the local arts were Malayo-Polynesian, Mon- Khmer, and South Sinitic growths under Indian stimulus' (269) sounds like an echo of Groslier's piquant characterization of 8th century Khmer art as 'un coktail hindo-greco-sino-malais,' which effervescent mixture also contains 'le temperament indigene' as an ingredient (loc. cit. 336). In literature, great epics precede the classical works, just as in Greece (478f.). 'The Indian, Near Eastern, and Occidental literatures on the whole developed more nearly on the Greek pattern. . . . Sanskrit literature is like Greek in showing a homogeneous, concurrent growth; though a very much slower one, as in other fields of civilization' (616 f.). In both countries lyric, drama, narrative poetry, and prose came to flower simultaneously, only the season, 'as in all other activities of time- less India' (479), lingered on about twice as long. The unfolding of the later vernacular literatures (479, 482)20 follows that of Sanskrit literature, but these form to a certain degree a single growth, just as in China the drama and novel in the non- classical style followed the classical literature (617). The comparative treatment of the 2nd century A.D. is supposed to teach the present what it has to learn in order to predict the future: Roman literature was a thing of the past, Greek literature was 'in a very pallid revival, Sanskrit active in a formative way preparatory to its great growth, Chinese actually starting its greatest de- velopment.' On the other hand, about 1750 'Chi- nese and Indian are on the ebb . . . end of the 19 Cf. my remarks, OLZ 1935, 573 and on the division into periods, ZL)MG 84. 115* f.

Tagore is surely as important for Indian litera- ture as Thomas Mann (559) is for German literature. By the way, Ricarda Huch, Fr. Werfel and H. Carossa ought to have been mentioned as eminent contemporaries of Mann. 139</page><page sequence="8">SCHIERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth Japanese pulse . . . opening of the great burst of German literature' (621). Painting enjoyed a continuous cultivation dur- ing more than 2000 successive years. The zenith of the first flowering period (450-750) Kroeber places about 600 A. D., with a previous historical development of 800 years or more, and a subse- quent decline of about 1000 years; about 1600 there follows a renaissance of several centuries under Persian and European influence (331; Table 310). To Kroeber's judgment on the ancient cave frescoes in India and Ceylon, namely, that in their lifelikeness they are more delightful and attractive than Indian plastic work (329), everyone will subscribe who visited the strikingly arranged ex- hibition of Katchadourian's copies shown at the Boston Fine Arts Museum in 1941, or who knows B. Rowland's Wall-Paintings (1938, with Intro- duction by Coomaraswamy). In connection with what Kroeber has to say about his predecessors, the long excerpt on pp. 17-9 will be both new and interesting to most readers. Even the Roman historian Gaius Vel- leius Paterculus (19 B. c.-31 A. D.) reflected on the configurations of Greek and Roman culture and sought to explain the appearance of a galaxy of geniuses in specific and limited epochs. Within the last two decades Hermann Goetz set to work to compare the course of Indian and European culture (Epochen der indischen Kultur, 1929).21 Today it would certainly be an easy task for the author, who meanwhile during good times and bad has carefully studied the lay of things in India, to rework his much too voluminous publication into a brief and compact handbook; it would con- stitute a welcome addition to the Grundriss. To Oswald Spengler's much discussed Decline of the West, Kroeber devotes a special section (825-33). He keeps a balance between praise and censure, agreement and disagreement. Here are a few sentences as examples. ' He seems as constitu- tionally incapable of analysis as of methodical order. Besides apperceiving intuitively, he can only synthesize. This seems the basis of the "mysticism" with which he is so often charged' (831). 'Spengler uses individuals as material 21 Cf. also Goetz' Introduction to his Bilderatlas zur Kulturgeschichte Indiens in der Grossmoghul-Zeit. Die materielle Kultur des Alltags, ihre Wurzeln, Schichten, Wandlungen und Beziehungen zu anderen Volkern (1930). only sporadically, and chiefly as exemplary illus- trations. But our point of view with regard to them as historic material is the same: essentially, persons are indicators of cultural phenomena.' 'Cultures are . . . as distinct as personalities, or even as organisms of different genus. This view I do not share....' (826). 'The two Spenglerian principles with which this study is . . . in essen- tial accord are, first, the existence of certain funda- mental patterns characteristic of each major cul- ture, and second, that these occur in limited growths' (828). About the relationships between Spengler and the not less criticized Kulturkreis-Theorie of Graebner and Wilhelm Schmidt, Kroeber has this to say: 'The quality common to the two systems is the essentially complete resolution of the totality of human culture into a number of ultimate and definitely limited entities of assumed but really unexamined historic reality and separateness' (833). What must first strike anyone who reads Kroeber alongside Spengler is the fact that Kroeber does not follow suit in the distinction between Culture and Civilization. But why does he pass over this difference in silence-except for the slight allusion on p. 829-and use the two expressions for the most part as about equivalent? One should re-read Spengler once again in order to see just how much he makes of this differentia- tion (I. 31 f.). 'Every Culture has its own Civilization. In this work, for the first time the two words, hitherto used to express an indefinite, more or less ethical, distinction, are used in a periodic sense, to express a strict and necessary organic succession. The Civilization is the inevit- able destiny of the Culture, and in this principle we obtain the viewpoint from which the deepest and gravest problems of historical morphology be- come capable of solution. Civilizations are the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable. They are a conclusion . . death following life ... petri- fying world-city following mother-earth.... They are an end, irrevocable, yet by inward necessity reached again and again. So, for the first time, we are enabled to understand the Romans as the successors of the Greeks. .... The Romans were barbarians who did not precede but closed a great development [Kroeber (831) gives his allegiance to another conception, but: ' Spengler's view may 140</page><page sequence="9">SCHERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth prove to be the deeper and juster']. ... In a word, Greek soul-Roman intellect; and this anti- thesis is the differentia between Culture and Civilization. Nor is it only to the Classical that it applies .... In such " late " periods do Bud- dhism, Stoicism, Socialism ripen into definitive world-conceptions. . . . Pure Civilization, as a historical process, consists in a progressive taking- down of forms that have become inorganic or dead.' Now also one understands Spengler's evaluation of Buddha and India, and notes at the same time the distortion: 22 for only that civiliza- tion deserves Spengler's anathema, which alienates itself from the past instead of carefully binding every reform tightly to its precious possession of tradition. For him Culture streams from the epochs of the Rigveda, of Plotinus, and of Dante; Civilization from Indian Buddhism and Roman Stoicism as 'homologous forms' (I. 111); the Buddhist derivation of suffering from ignorance, namely, of the 'Four Noble Truths' is true rationalism. 'Nirvana ... is a purely intellectual release' (II. 307). Before Kroeber discusses Spengler, he sets down his own almost aphoristic opinion. 'Cultures merge into one another, and so cannot have the individual entity of higher organisms' (761). He holds it to be possible, though not proved, that because individual organisms must die, particular cultures must also die. But equally unproved, al- though possible, is the antithetical view at present so much favored, that particular cultures neither die nor grow old, but evolve with steady progress. 22 The scheme finally becomes grotesque. Where does Culture begin? How long does it maintain its purity? Why does the overshadowing of Culture by Civilization ever start? In the face of such problems, Spengler's baton wavers; the instruments no longer come in on the right beat. Much more just and penetrating, as far as Brahmanism and Buddhism are concerned, are the re- marks of P. A. Sorokin, Social and Cultural Dynamics, 4.212f., 241, 304, 392 (1941). (Because of Kroeber's proviso on 834, 849 f., I have not gone into a discussion of the works of Sorokin and Toynbee.) In a few sentences, short and to the point, Huizinga does justice to the general notion of Culture and Spengler's conception of it: Im Schatten von Morgen. Eine Diagnose des kulturellen Leidens unsrer Zeit.3 30f., 156, 181-183 (1936); in the latter place pertinent remarks on the short duration of flowering periods. The faults and virtues of Spengler's system he weighs with the utmost cleverness in Wege der Kulturgeschichte 58 (1930). The fundamental postulate of his analysis is, as he says, that they are not necessarily subject to dis- solution nor to evolution, but that they do undergo change; in place of death or progress he sees fluctuations (821f.). This I approve, for it is not cheap agnosticism, but an (unconscious?) adoption of the Heraclitean and Buddhistic leit- motiv. On the other hand, along with the words which introduce Kroeber's Review and Conclu- sions-' I see no evidence of any true law in the phenomena dealt with; nothing cyclical, regularly repetitive, or necessary' (761)-the Indologist is tempted to call to mind the ancient Indian cosmic principle of rta.23 It may be that this will offer 23 Rta apparently derives originally from the engraft- ing of Avestan asa upon the Indian stem; Keith, Rel. and Philos. of the Veda 35 (1925) seems also to hold this opinion. In India rta, a genuine old Vedic word for order in the macrocosm and in the microcosm, very soon passes out of use. Its cultic function was then taken over by the conception of the sacrifice and its mystic rites; its philosophico-religious function by satya, dharman (its variant dharma being increasingly employed under the impetus provided by the Buddhist dhamma), and in the last instance by brdhman (neut.); atman and purusa come into the discussion at the same time or shortly afterwards when philosophical debates were more the order of the day. Thereby rta is defi- nitely separated from Avestan asa. Asa does not lose its vigor like rta, its cognate both by etymology and by meaning; it is only that the original meaning of asa 'universal law, divine order' was reformed and trans- formed in a great many ways (cf. the two articles by Mills, JAOS 20 [1899]). Asa is, I believe, the first step in the introduction to the Logos idea. Geldner, Grundr. d. iran. Philol. 2.39; Jackson, ibid. 634, 637 (1896-1904) reach the same conclusion by way of simi- lar routes. There is no Iranian equivalent of brdhman. Baraz(is), barasman =barhis never gets beyond the role of a sacrificial utensil endowed with particular holiness. The relationship between barhis etc. and brahman is in essence purely etymological, not semantic. Oldenberg declares the original identity of barasman and barhis to be 'kaum zweifelhaft,' but 'mit brahman hat bares- man schwerlich etwas zu tun' (already in 1894 in the first edition of his Rel. d. Veda 342 f.). Very commendable is his maxim: 'Das Band zwischen Ety- mologie und Gebrauch des Worts kann ja ein recht loses sein' (Gottinger Nachrichten 1916. 730). The outstanding articles by Mills and Gray, and Hille- brandt, ERE II (1910), s.v. barsom and brahman, are written with the same prudent sobriety. Even in the revised edition of his Ved. Myth. 2.368 (1929) Hille- brandt declared: 'Das Etymologisieren hat mytholo- gische Fragen oft mehr verdunkelt als aufgeklart und die Exegese von ihrem Platz verdringt.' But he sinned against this his own principle when in 1926 (Pestgabe 141</page><page sequence="10">SCHERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth Kroeber some consolation, when he says, 'I con- fess to some lowering of expectations in the course of my work' (762). The title of Kroeber's book is in striking con- trast with Spengler's ominous Untergang des Abendlandes, for which the English translation Decline of the West is somewhat too mild. To be H. Jacobi 265-270) he returned to the camp of Haug, Griswold, et al., and, for the sake of the identification with barasman, interpreted brdhman as a symbolic botanical charm. (Neisser's objections, ZII 5.286f. (1927), were refuted but on insufficient grounds by Charpentier, Brahman 59, 71 [1932]). One must gird himself with still stronger faith in order to follow Dumezil, Flamen-Brahman (1935), who, building on Charpentier, finds in the Indo-European root of brah- man, barasman, and flamen 'les instruments vegetaux de la technique sacrificielle.' For the etymological com- parison itself, cf. E. Leumann, Zur nordar. Sprache 63 (1912) s.v. balysa. As far as I can see, the group consisting of barhis, barasman on the one hand, and brdhman on the other, tended semasiologically-and the frequent change of meaning, not a fossilized etymology is what counts in the history of culture-in quite different directions from the very beginning of the texts we know. The amaz- ingly erudite Charpentier again took up assiduously the old endeavor to reach the common source of these streams. His book, the concluding part of which has not, I think, been published since his untimely death, is the most patient and the richest treatment of the subject. Much of what he said will retain its worth, but the etymological sections, in which he attempts to throw light on a time beyond anything we know from literary history, still hang in mid-air. Now suddenly the trilingual Xerxes inscription (ca. 486 B.C.), discovered in 1935, is supposed to have transplanted the hollowed brdhman from India to Achaemenid Persia. This tablet unites in a kind of stereotyped formula arta and a word for which Herz- feld, Altpers. Inschr. I, 116-18 (1938), gives three trans- literations: OP. brzmniy, Elam. pir.ra.ic.man.ni.ia, Akk. bi-ra-za-am-man-ni-i. He concludes that these trans- literations demand the reading brazman, and that it is hardly to be doubted that this brazman is to be identi- fied with the Indian brahman. But even in Archaeol. Mitt. aus Iran 8.69 (1936) he had had to admit that brazman-, brazmanya- are not to be found in the Gatha dialect of the Avesta. I think we must go farther and stress that neither the word nor the meaning brdhman is known up to now from any Iranian text or from any other source pertaining to Persia. Nowhere has anyone ever heard of any propensity of Xerxes for Indian the- ology, whose most anxiously guarded treasure has been the notion of brdhman ever since the rise of such specu- lations; on the contrary, Xerxes stands under the sus- picion of having destroyed a temple in Media because people there adored gods with Daiva names like Indra and fiarva (Christensen, Essai sur la demonologie iranienne 46 [1941]). sure, Kroeber is not in the mood for such a hymn of jubilation as Sorokin chanted to a world trem- bling in fear (4. 779 [1941]; with brave assur- ance already in 1. xiii [1937]); but still he does rise to a subdued optimism. 'It is true that the civilizations of Islam, India, China, Japan, seem definitely ended in their historic forms. But who In between the two above mentioned articles by Herz- feld, Roland G. Kent published an important paper on this subject in Language 1937. 292 ff.; he comes to the same conclusion as Herzfeld: 'brazman- is the same stem as Skt. brahman- . . . but is here an adj. . . . (301) modifying arta and meaning 'holy or the like' (305). According to my view, the passage says that Ahura- mazda and Arta are worshipped with the brazman ('bundle of twigs'); i.e. I equate brazman with the well-known barosman. More or less diverging from this interpretation are those given by Hartmann, OLZ 1937. 148ff., Nyberg, Die Religionen des alten Iran 367 (1938), Bailey, ibid. 478, Henning BSOS 10. 506 (1940), Christensen 40 f.-, but none of them explains brazman as brdhman. Because of my deviation from Herzfeld and Kent, I wrote to inquire whether Professor Kent still held the same opinion. He was kind enough to send me a de- tailed reply, in which he did not conceal the difficulty in the entire lack of an Iranian word corresponding in meaning to Skt. brdhman and its derivatives, but none- theless placed his confidence in the Elamite transcrip- tion in which the reading braz- is unambiguous. He added that the OP. text gives the choice between the two normalizations braz- and barz-. Now, the OP. script is not clear about the junction of consonants and vowels into a syllable, and the Akk. bi-ra- is normalized by Herzfeld to bra-. The Elamite scholars will have to determine whether or not the Elamite transcription is absolutely decisive for the reading braz-, and if so, whether a metathesis, such as is common in IE. and Semitic languages, must be excluded here. I cannot do better than draw my conclusions from Weissbach's con- viction that of the trilingual inscriptions, the OP. texts are probably without exception the originals from which the Elamite and Babylonian versions were made (Keil- inschr. d. Achdmeniden xxxii [1911]). In view of this, I see no reason to abandon my translation. Professor Kent writes me that he means to issue shortly a com- prehensive work on the OP. inscriptions, and besides, following up several points discussed in our correspond- ence, to treat the matter further in a forthcoming article in Language. I shall look forward with great interest to these publications, which it is to be hoped will widen our horizons in this regard. Until then, as long as no other occurrences of brazman in the sense of Indian brdhman nor any other supports appear, I take a sceptical attitude toward the revolutionary effort to win Iranian ground for the Indian brahman. Still another point deserves consideration. Even if brazman is the assured reading, the variants braz-, barz- may be of no great consequence. For such forms 142</page><page sequence="11">SCHERMAN_: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth can tell whether after an interval wholly new cul- tures, rooting both in these old ones and in the Occidental one, may not spring up as independent growths, on old soil?' (623) It is especially in India's future that I repose great confidence. That contemporary Indian writers on cultural politics have suddenly discovered how expedient it can be to put Buddha's name on their coat-of-arms is a sign of the times-if Gandhi's plans to rescue the Untouchables from the wretchedness of caste do not prove to be just so many pretty bubbles in the air. When K. Shridharani (My India, My America 392 f. [1943']) says that Jayakar 'under- lined the missionary philosophy of Buddhism,' and when he adds that 'last but far from least, was the movement to bring Buddhistic learning back [from Japan] to India. More Buddhist temples and monasteries have been opened in India in the last we have ready to hand two possible alternative explana- tions along different lines. In the first place, I would call attention to the variation in strong and weak stems in the Avestan dthravan- / athaurun- (cf. the complete declension in Justi, Handbuch d. Zendspr. 50). Note that the weak stem corresponds with the Skt. atharvan, which latter was, I conjecture, borrowed from Persia. Here we are in the familiar sphere of the laws of Ablaut, which are nowhere more clearly displayed than in the sequence: r, ar, ra, rd, as already noted by Adal- bert Kuhn in 1859 (Herabkunft d. Feuers 11 f. [1886]); analogous remarks on ra and r in brdhman and V brh, based on Panini, in Kirste, Le Gouna inverse, MSLP 8.93 (1894). On a supposed *barhman prior to brdhman, set up to unite brdhman and barasman, cf. the dubious constructions of Charpentier 60-63, 126. He suggests (81) that there was an Iranian word for brahman which became obsolete due to the power of the Median magu, and this idea was taken so much in earnest by Dumezil that he postulates (76) "un bardsman masculin! " In the second place, there is a striking parallel in the metathesis which has occurred in dhramika (instead of dharmika) which translates the Greek 8lKatos on bilingual Indo-Greek coins beginning with the second century B. C. It was a Saka-Iranian dialect which ex- changed the syllable dhra for dhar, and about these tribes the Achaemenids from Darius on were perfectly well informed, as we know from inscriptional and literary evidence (Jackson, CHI 1. 338 ff. (1922); on the date, cf. Hinz, ZDMG 1938. 147, 162, 171).-Khota- nese official documents used ttrruki and ttfirki as the name of the Turks (Bailey, JRAS 1939.86f.). Hence, for the translation of the Xerxes inscription, I see no obstacle to the use of the explanation of the adjec- tives barasmaniya and barssmanay as 'zum barosman gehorig,' given in Bartholomae's Air. Worterb. It would be wrong to scorn the helping hand of the Realien. The old Iranian sacred twigs (cf. e. g. Bar- decade than in the preceding century,' the Japa- nese propaganda which may be concealed behind his words will perhaps be prejudicial to their delectability. Nevertheless, we do not need to ex- clude the recognition that the inalienable heritage bequeathed by the over-towering religious genius of India could well bear compound interest in Delhi and London.24 To come back for a moment to Spengler, Indian culture does not so much occupy his attention to have made it imperative for Kroeber to adduce counter-arguments against his evaluations. Yet from the manner in which he considers (684-6) Brahmanism and Buddhism as 'expressions of polar attitudes within one civilization,' it is evi- dent that he does not minimize 'this important matter which has never been satisfactorily defined.' Kroeber's belief in the power of personality is tholomae 948 and Pavry, Iranian Studies 205 f. [1927]) have become familiar to us from literature both old and new, and in addition our knowledge has been enriched by the illustrations published in Herzfeld's volumes, the latest (1941) being Iran and the Ancient East P1. 35 with fig. 315 and p. 201, 205; P1. 86 with p. 286 and Mar- shall, JRAS 1943. 122; P1. 126 with p. 313, 328, 379ff.; P1. 105 with p. 289 f.-sculptures covering the long in- terval from the old Median to the Sassanid dynasties; Herzfeld himself speaks of the barsom as a requisite of the old Iranian cult and known from Median antiquity (313, 201). Such facts make it appear very improbable that the most primitive form 'des sicher gemein- arischen Kultrequisits,' namely, the strewing about of the sacrificial grass, could have been meant in the Xerxes inscription (Nyberg 371), rather than the bundle of twigs. We do not need to forsake the sure footing provided by ancient cultic objects. In concluding this excursus, whose length will, I hope, be excused after consideration of the importance of the problems dealt with, I may be permitted to add a word concerning arta. Whether it is still used in its old abstract meaning or appears already as the personified helper (archangel) of Ahuramazda is a matter left undecided by Kent (305); I incline to the latter inter- pretation, because here we are approaching, as I said above, the Logos idea. Much more remarkable is the fact that the OP. form arta usurps the place held by asa in the 'canonical' texts-a reversion to the phonetic situation which we meet already in names like Arta- tama in the Mitanni period about a thousand years before Xerxes (JAOS 63.259 (1943); cf. Kretschmer, KZ 55.99 f. (1927), Sturtevant, Yale Class. Studies I. 216f. (1928) and Christensen 40). 24 The exposition of Buddhist influence on the religion, art and literature of the leading countries of the Far East lies outside the limits of this review: but see Kroeber's pertinent remarks, 72, 276, 335ff., 669ff., 771 f. 143</page><page sequence="12">SCHERMAN: India and Kroeber's Configurations of Culture Growth very much weaker than my own (cf. note 1); in spite of this I have the impression that he would not chide me if I ventured to use the metaphor that from the union of Buddha and amrkara in the manner of Harihara there shines forth the eternally radiant central sun of India. The editors of the JAOS asked that I review the parts of the encyclopedic investigation of Pro- fessor Kroeber which deal with India. I harbor grave doubts whether this commission to a spe- cialist has been fulfilled adequately. At any rate I felt encouraged to undertake the task when I recalled the principles enunciated by a deceased friend of mine. He laid stress on the fact that the specialties of research are to a certain degree fictions; there is actually no such isolation. Special knowledge gets its meaning only by being inserted into the whole. In this matter we are free and able to ask metaphysical questions and to try to answer them. They lie along the same line as that method of thinking which we consider legitimate for the specialties of research.5 26 Aloys Fischer in the Vorwort to Erich Becher, Deutsche Philosophen, p. xxvii (1929): 'Die Fachwis- eenschaften erweisen sich insofern als Fiktionen, als ihre Gegenstande niemals und nirgends in der Isolierung real waren oder sind, in der sie die Wissenschaft fir ihre Zwecke zurechtprapariert: ohne eine Theorie des Ganzen ist die Einzeleinsicht sozusagen vorzeichenlos. . .

THE ANATOLIAN LION GOD AT.RXANDER H. KRAPPE PRINCETON, N. J. Sur les dalles, de place en place, 4taient ac- croupis, comme des sphinx, des lions enormes, symboles vivants du soleil devorateur. G. FLAUBERT. [Continuing the research of Wilamowitz on the Ana- tolian Apollon, an attempt is made to show that this god was originally a lion-shaped solar divinity, the proto- type of the Greek Herakles, slayer of the Nemean lion. The cult of this lion god extended over Syria, Palestine (Samson), and Egypt, and is reflected in ancient as- tronomy. The Anatolian lion god had for companion a lion goddess (Kybele, Omphale), known, in Continental Greece, as Dejaneira, a daughter of Dionysos or of Oineus, in Syria, as Dalilah ('vine branch'). The god is identical with the Cilician Sandan, the Tyrian Ba'al Melqart, who was solemnly burned, once a year, on a mighty pyre. The name of the Lydian capital, Sardes, is derived from the form Sardan of the same divine name, just as its pre-Lydian name, :6apts, is connected with Ved. Sarya, Gr. "IIXtos. The word sard, of Iranian origin, means 'year,' thus proving that Sandan-Sardan was essentially a year god. The Arm. sard corresponds in meaning to the Gr. c5aip5v, the name of Apollon's sacred tree.] IN A STUDY which at the time of this writing has probably appeared in the Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni (Rome), building on the founda- tions laid by the late U. v. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, the writer attempted to show the wide diffusion of an Anatolian sun god, not only in Asia Minor but over the Peloponnesus and as far west as Southern Italy. The name of this divinity, 5vpos or AuKOS, leaves no doubt about his I.-E. origin and his rela- tionship with the Vedic Surya on the one hand, the Hellenic Apollon Lykos or Lykeios on the other. The diffusion of his cult could be traced, with a fair degree of accuracy, by means of place names and cult legends. Still, one would like to have more details about this ancient divinity, who was clearly one of the several that went into the making of the Greek Apollon. It is the purpose of this article to throw such additional light on the Ana- tolian Apollon as the ascertainable facts may seem to warrant. It is well established that the last Lydian king, Kroisos, was an ardent devotee of Apollon,1 and we have no reason to think that the view taken of his god by a refined and amiable monarch differed much from the classical model. For Kroisos lived in an enlightened age, already far removed from the fancies of barbarism. What views were held in more remote ages are revealed by a rather crude story told by Herodotus (I. 84), to the effect that 1 Cf. A.
