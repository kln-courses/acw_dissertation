Although Knut Hamsun's contribution to modernism has generally been acknowledged by critics, most of the attention has been focussed on his use of modernist themes and his network of symbols. The Roots of Modernist Narrative is the first book-length study of Hamsun's three great modernist novels of the 1890s from the theoretical perspective of narratology. Es- chewing the narratology of French structuralism with its neglect of context, Humpál describes his method as "historical narrative poetics" (11) and draws on the theories of Dorrit Cohn and Franz K. Stanzel (28). In the first chapter, "Hamsun and Modernist Narrative," Humpál notes the central modernist theme of "inauthenticity resulting from a mind-split between social constructs and private anxieties" (17). The bourgeois metalanguage of nineteenth-century realism is absent from modern works, which seek to illumine the private world. Humpál isolates the three major formal characteristics of modernism as: 1. the suppression or elimination of the narrator and the substitution of a neutral narrative function; 2. marked use of stream of consciousness, free indirect discourse, and figurai narra- tion; and 3. the perspectivization of narrative (37). The succeeding three chapters examine Hunger, Mysteries, and Pan as modernist works: each is modernist in a different way. Hunger shows the most formal innovation in the disappearance of the narrator and the immediacy of free indirect discourse. The last chapter, on Pan, repeats the oft-discussed split in Glahn's psyche, his retreat from the public world to his private one. This is territory that has already been very well trod, although the two sides of the split have been variously labeled by different critics. Humpál is original, however, in showing how the narrative style marks the split. The perfective mode reflects the dynamic public world, and the static, eternal, recurring private sphere of nature and dream is expressed in imperfective narration (123). Hamsun's use of language makes Glahn's ambiguity all the more striking. Particularly impressive is chapter three, on Mysteries. Humpál shows how the perspectives of the novel exclude the possibility of one omniscient, anthropomorphic narrator. The very lack of cohesion and resolution of the book's mysteries are deliberate. Far from being an incoherent failure (as early critics considered 't' Mysteries is, Humpál shows, a deliberate parody of realist narrative. Its subject is the unfathomable human mind, and nothing ties up its loose ends; Nagel's attempts to solve a crime are simply a parody of rationality. The chapter ends with a felicitous comparison of Hamsun's novel to Cubist painting: just as the subject of a typical Cubist portrait "is presented as a conglomerate of various facets or fragments" yet</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 491 the combination of these "is often unrealistic both spatially and tempo- rally55 (103), so NagePs "portrait55 is refracted by the partial glimpses of him that the other characters receive - glimpses filtered through varying hues of self-interest and temperament. Instead of a window, Hamsun has let us see Nagel (and the town) through a prism. The book is a barely modified dissertation, but despite the limitations ofthat genre, it is articulately argued and eloquently written. The Roots of Modernist Narrative has filled a gap in Hamsun research and will likely be a springboard for continued investigation of Hamsun's formal innova- tion.
