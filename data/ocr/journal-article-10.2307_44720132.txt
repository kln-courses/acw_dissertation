Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT A family of adult and child size dummies was developed under the direction of two task groups of the SAE Mechanical Human Simulation Subcommittee of the Human Biomechanics and Simulation Standards Committee. These new child size dummies represent fiftieth percentile children who are 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 3 years, and 6 years old. The sizes and total body weights of the dummies were based on detailed anthropometry studies of children of these ages. The techniques used to establish the segment masses and the resulting design goals are detailed. Appropriate impact response requirements were scaled from the biofidelity response requirements of the Hybrid III, taking into account the differences in size, mass and elastic modulus of bone between adults and children. The techniques used to establish the biomechanical impact response requirements for the child dummies are discussed and the resulting biomechanical impact response requirements are given. INTRODUCTION A family of biofidelic adult and child-size dummies has been developed by two SAE task groups, the Hybrid III Dummy Family Task Group and the Infant Dummy Task Group. Members of these task groups work for the auto industry, safety test facilities, universities, NHTSA, and dummy and instrumentation manufacturers. In 1987, Dr. Richard Stalnaker of the Ohio State University received a grant from the Centers for Disease Control to develop a family of adult and child dummies with the same level of biofidelity and measurement capacity as the Hybrid III fiftieth percentile male. The SAE Hybrid III Dummy Family Task Group was formed to provide design direction including the impact response requirements for Hybrid III type small female, large male, and 6 year old dummies. In 1992, the task group decided to upgrade the 3 year old dummy as well. In 1990, the SAE Infant Dummy Task Group was formed at the request of the SAE Child Restraint Air Bag Interaction (CRABI) Task Group to develop dummies to represent 6, 12 and 18 month old children for use in assessing airbag interactions with rear facing child restraints. This paper describes the sizes, weights, scale factors and biofidelic impact response requirements specified by the SAE task groups for the CRABI and Hybrid III child dummies. Dummies that meet these requirements are commercially available. SIZES AND WEIGHTS Characteristic dimensions of the new child dummies were based on the latest information available on the size and weight of children in the United States (1-8). These data were interpolated, as necessary, to estimate the dimensions at the desired age from the ranges of data given. The characteristic dimensions of 3 and 6 year old children are given in Table 1 along with corresponding dimensions for a mid-size adult male. The characteristic dimensions of 6, 12 and 18 month old children are given in Table 2. More detailed dimensions for the head and neck of the various child dummies and the Hybrid III mid-size adult male dummy are given in Figure 1 and Table 3. The ratios of head depths, head heights and neck circumferences were used to calculate the A-P head dimensions, the I-S head dimensions and neck lengths for the child dummies using the corresponding dimensions from the Hybrid III mid-size adult male (8), respectively. The total body masses of the child dummies were also obtained from the child anthropometry studies. Three different approaches were taken to estimate the appropriate segment masses. Segment masses of the 6 year old child dummy were determined from a plaster cast of the Masterbody Form (4) for a 6 year old child. The cast was segmented similar to the Hybrid III, where the thigh flap is included with the torso instead of the thigh. Segment weights of the 3 year old dummy were previously established (4, 5) and maintained in this program. Plaster molds of body forms 3551</page><page sequence="2">Table 1 .

Therefore, the segment masses were assigned in direct proportion to the volumes of a series of simple geometric forms which approximated the body. The body segment masses for the Hybrid III mid-size adult male dummy and for the various sizes of child dummies are summarized in Table 4. ELASTIC BENDING MODULI The elastic bending moduli of bone for children and adults were obtained from published data for cranial bone. McPherson and Kriewall (9) presented elastic moduli for the bending of the parietal bones of two full term newborns and one 6 year old child. Samples of the newborns' parietal bones were cut either parallel or perpendicular to the fiber orientation of the bone plate. The average values for the parallel or perpendicular samples were obtained for each of the two infants. These were then averaged to obtain an overall Elastic Bending Modulus of 2.5 GPa for the newborn. The parietal bone samples of the 6 year old child were cut either parallel or perpendicular to the sagittal suture. An average Elastic Bending Modulus of 6.6 GPa was obtained for the 6 year old child. Hubbard (10) presented similar data for the parietal bone of the adults, although no differences due to the orientation of the sample were observed. An Elastic Bending Modulus for the parietal bone of the adult was given as 9.9 GPa. A cubic spline fit of these data was performed to estimate the elastic moduli for the bending of bone for the 6 month, 12 month, 18 month, 3 year old and 6 year old children and the adult. Figure 2 shows three cubic spline fits of the elastic moduli, assuming that the adult modulus is achieved at either 1 8, 20, or 22 years. Note that the three curves are identical for children below the age of 6. Estimates of the elastic moduli for the bending of the parietal bones of a 6 month, 12 month, 18 month, 3 year old, 6 year old and adult are given in Table 5. SCALE FACTORS Characteristic dimensions and segment masses for each body region and the elastic bending moduli of bone that were used to calculate the scale factors given in Table 6 relative to the corresponding Hybrid III mid-size adult male segment were selected from the anthropometric values given in Tables 1-5. For the head, a single characteristic dimension, the sum of the head circumference, breadth and depth, was chosen to calculate the values of (Xx, X^ given in Table 6. 3552</page><page sequence="3">Table 2.

The masses of the heads of the children given in Table 4 were calculated as the products of the Hybrid III head mass and the corresponding head mass scale factor given in Table 6. This formulation assured that all heads had equal mass density. For the neck and torso of the Hybrid III 6 year old dummy and for the torsos of the other dummies, the characteristic length was chosen as the erect seated height and the total body mass was used to calculate the mass ratios. The corresponding length, Xz, and mass, X^, scale factors are given in Table 6. The depth and breadth scale factors were assumed equal and were chosen to assure that the mass density ratio, Xp, was equal to one; i.e., = 0) The values for X^ and X y are given in Table 6. For the neck of the Hybrid III 3 year old, the scale factors used by Wolanin et al (5) for the development of the 3 year old airbag dummy's neck were used since the intention was to use this neck structure on the Hybrid III 3 year old dummy. Wolanin et al used the ratio of neck circumferences for Xx , X y and X z with X^ being equal to the product of these three scale factors. The same scaling procedure was used for the CRABI necks since the CRABI necks are modified versions of the 3 year old airbag dummy neck. The scale factors are given in Table 6. Scale factors for the thigh and the leg were determined only for the 6 year old since the other child dummies are not expected to be used to evaluate restraint systems that produce knee and/or leg impacts. For the thigh, the characteristic length and mass were selected as the rump to knee dimension and the thigh mass, respectively. For the leg, the knee to sole and the sum of the legs and feet masses were chosen as the characteristic length and mass, respectively. The corresponding length, Xz, and mass, X^, scale factors are given in Table 6. The depth and breadth scale factors were assumed equal within each body segment and were selected to assure that the mass density ratio was one using Equation 1 . The values for X* and Xy are given in Table 6. Scale factors for the elastic bending moduli, XE, of bone were calculated based on the values given in Table 5 and are given in Table 6. BIOMECHANICAL IMPACT RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS The scaling techniques developed by Mertz (11, 12) were used to define biomechanical impact response requirements for the child dummies based on the biomechanical response corridors for the mid-size adult male that were used to develop the Hybrid III dummy (13, 14).

Elastic Bending Modulus of Parietal Bone as a Function of Age. effects of differences in size, shape, mass and elastic modulus of bone of the children and the adult are included in the analysis. Response requirements for the head and neck are defined for each child dummy. Chest impact response requirements are defined only for the 3 and 6 year old dummies since the infant dummies will be used only to evaluate rear facing child restraints where chest impact is not a concern. Knee impact and knee joint drawer response requirements are defined for the 6 year old because impacts to the lower extremities could occur when testing with this size dummy. HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE - The biofidelity impact response requirement for the Hybrid III head is a drop test onto a flat, rigid surface from a height of 376 mm. For a forehead impact, the peak resultant head acceleration for a mid-size adult male should be between 225 and 275 G (13, 14). This requirement was established based on the responses of cadaveric heads (15, 16). The acceleration of the center of mass of a head due to a forehead impact to a rigid, flat plate will be dependent on the head's mass, geometry, and forehead stiffness. For the various child dummies and the mid-size adult male, representative head masses and geometries are specified by the various anthropometry studies (1-8) and are given in Tables 1-4. The forehead stiffness is dependent on the interactions between the stiffnesses of the brain, the skull and the flesh layer covering the forehead. For adults, Mertz et al. (11) have shown that the ratio of forehead stiffnesses is proportional to the ratio of the characteristic head length dimensions and the ratio of accelerations is inversely proportional to the characteristic stiffness ratio, or, Ra=l/Rk=l/Àx (2) This relationship is valid for different size people whose ratios of material properties for their brains, skull and flesh are equal to 1 . For infants and children, the material properties of their skulls are not identical to those of adults (Figure 2 and Table 5), and these differences must be considered when defining the forehead stiffness ratio for comparing children to adults. In the infant, the skull consists of small bone plates that are connected by wide bands of cartilage. This construction allows the head to statically deform during birth, without causing high stresses in the brain. With age, the bone plates become larger as the cartilage ossifies. In the adult, the bone plates are interconnected at joints called sutures. In addition to these changes in skull structure, the elastic bending modulus of skull bone also increases with age. The effect of the elastic bending modulus on forehead stiffness is analyzed in the Appendix. This analysis shows that the high bulk modulus of the brain is more dominant than the elastic bending modulus of the skull. As a result, there is less than a 4 percent reduction in forehead stiffness when comparing the stiffnesses of an adult head using its elastic bending modulus and using the modulus of a 3 year old child. Based on this result, it was concluded that the relationship given by Equation 2, which was derived for adults, could be applied to the 3 and 6 year old dummies. For the infant CRABI dummies, the forehead stiffness will be dependent on the membrane stiffness of the cartilage connecting the bone plates as well as the bulk modulus of the brain, the bending modulus of the skull bones and the stiffness of the forehead flesh. As discussed previously, for static loading, the infant head is easily 3555</page><page sequence="6">Table 4.

However, for forehead impacts to a rigid plate, the rate of loading will be quite high. Since cartilage is viscoelastic, its membrane stiffness will increase, increasing the "dynamic" stiffness of the head. No attempt was made to model this interaction since time -dependent material properties for the interconnecting cartilage are unknown. In absence of such an analysis, the relationship proposed by Melvin (17) that the acceleration response should scale in direct proportion to the skull bending modulus and inversely to the characteristic length of the head, K=XE/Xx (3) can be used for the CRABI heads for defining both forehead and back-of-head requirments. The values of Xx and A,E for the heads of the CRABI and Hybrid III child dummies given in Table 6 were used to calculate the acceleration ratios from Equations 3 and 2, respectively. The acceleration requirements for the Hybrid III mid-size adult male were multiplied by these acceleration ratios to obtain the acceleration requirements for each dummy. The acceleration requirements were rounded to the nearest 5 G and are given in Table 7. Note that the CRABI heads may be too soft when compared to heads of children of the same ages. However, if the child restraint system is designed so that the child does not experience a hard surface head impact under the design test condition, then the CRABI heads will give childlike responses. NECK BENDING RESPONSE - The biofidelity neck bending response tests for the Hybrid III mid-size adult male are conducted with the neck and head mounted to the bottom of a pendulum (13, 14). The deceleration pulse of the pendulum is controlled by a block of aluminum Hexcel. The Hybrid III requirements for neck flexion and extension are specified as corridors on the head angle versus moment plots shown in Figures 3 and 4. For the same pendulum test of different size necks, Mertz et al. (1 1) have shown that the ratio of neck bending moments, RM, is equal to the cube of the A* scale factor of the necks, or, RM = A,3 (4) and the ratio of head to torso angles, Re, is equal to Xz divided by A^ , or, R d = Xz/K (5) The neck scale factors, A^ and A*z, given in Table 6, were substituted into Equations 4 and 5 to calculate RM and Re. The coordinates of the neck bending response corridors for the children were obtained by multiplying the angles and moments of the Hybrid III mid-size adult male coordinates given in Table 8 by Re and RM, respectively. The resulting coordinates for the neck flexion and extension corridors, Figures 3 and 4, for the children are given in Table 8. CHEST IMPACT RESPONSE - Biofidelic chest response requirements are specified for two pendulum impact tests for the Hybrid III mid-size adult male (13,14). A 23.4 kg rigid pendulum is used for both tests. The impact velocities are 6.7 m/s and 4.3 m/s. The force-deflection response corridor is shown on Figure 5 and its coordinates are listed in Table 9. These pendulum impacts delivered to a 3 year old or a 6 year old child's chest would be too severe. Therefore, the pendulum mass was scaled to produce the same percent of chest deflection as in the Hybrid III. Mertz et al. (1 1) showed that to produce the same percent compression for a constant impact velocity, the pendulum mass, MPC, for the child test would have to equal, MPC = XE (MPa) (MTc) / [MTa + MPa (1 - *E )] (6) where, XE - Ratio of the elastic moduli of bone (Table 6) MPa - Mass of pendulum for adult test (23.4 kg) MTa - Mass of Hybrid III thorax (17.2 kg) MTC - Mass of child thorax (3.2 kg for 3 year old and 4.6 kg for 6 year old) 3557</page><page sequence="8">h TT § NECK FLEXION CORRIDOR / S O S 3 i-I I * / I O / U / ^ / ^ ^ N / / / / / N / / PU, / / / HH / / U HH / ^ w / o / HEAD TO TORSO ANGLE Figure 3.

For comparison of child ribs to adult ribs, XE will be less than one. Since the elastic bending moduli of the ribs of different ages are not available, the values of XE given in Table 6 for cranial bone were used, along with the values of A,x and Xz for the torso, to calculate the coordinates of the biofidelity corridors for 3 and 6 year old children (see Figure 5 and Table 9). The corresponding pendulum masses given in Table 9 were calculated using Equation 6 and the values that are given below the equation. KNEE IMPACT RESPONSE - The biofidelic knee impact response requirements for the Hybrid III mid-size adult male dummy are based on an analysis of rigid pendulum knee impacts to cadavers (13, 14). The biofidelity limits placed on the peak knee impact force when the mid-size adult male knee is impacted with a 5 kg rigid pendulum impactor at 2.1 m/s are given in Table 10. Since this pendulum impact would be too severe for a 6 year old, the pendulum mass was scaled to produce the same percent compression of the knee flesh as occurs in the mid-size male impact. Based on the method developed by Mertz et al. (1 1) for defining the biofidelic knee impact response requirements for the small female, the ratio of the pendulum masses, RP, is equal to the ratio of the thigh masses, Xm , given in Table 6, or, (9) and the ratio of knee impact forces, RF , is equal to the product of A^ and Xz for the thigh given in Table 6, or, Rf=^z (10) Using Equations 9 and 10 and the values for A.m, A^ and Xz given in Table 6 for the thigh, the pendulum impactor mass and the biofidelic range of peak knee forces were determined for a 6 year old child and are given in Table 10. KNEE JOINT DRAWER STIFFNESS - The biofidelic knee joint shearing stiffness between the femur and tibia (drawer stiffness) for the mid-size adult male (13, 14) was determined from static stiffness tests of cadaver knee joints (18, 19). The biofidelic stiffness range for the mid-size adult male is given in Table 1 1. Mertz et al. (1 1) showed that the ratio of drawer stiffnesses, RK, is equal to Xz where Xz is the average of the Xz for the thigh and the leg, or, Rk ~ 'Xz (11) Using Equation 1 1 and the average of the Xz values for the thigh and legs given in Table 6, the biofidelic drawer stiffness range for a 6 year old was determined and is given in Table 11.

Specifically, head impact response requirements and neck flexion and extension requirements were determined for 6 month, 12 month, 18 month, 3 year and 6 year old children. Chest impact response requirements were determined for 3 year and 6 year old children. Knee impact response and knee drawer stiffness requirements were determined for a 6 year old child. The scaling techniques of Mertz et al. (1 1, 12), Wolanin et al (5), and Melvin (17) were used to develop the requirements. The effects of differences in size, mass and tissue properties between adults and children were included in the analysis. The resulting biofidelity requirements provided the bases for the development of the CRABI 6, 12 and 18 month old infant dummies and the Hybrid III 3 and 6 year old child dummies. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to acknowledge the efforts of the members of the SAE Infant Dummy Task Group and the Hybrid III Dummy Family Task Group for their review and comments on the development of these biomechanical response guidelines. These guidelines are the consensus of the task groups and were use to develop the CRABI and Hybrid III child dummies. REFERENCES 1 .

The stiffness of the head to an externally applied load to the forehead is dependent on the interactions between the stiffnesses of the brain, kB, skull, ks, and flesh layer, kF, that covers the skull. Since the brain and skull experience the same amount of local deformation, they form a parallel stiffness element which is in series with the flesh stiffness. Consequently, the head stiffness, kH, can be expressed as, k e kH= f e (AD 1 + - - kB + ks The brain, which is a highly incompressible, viscoelastic material, provides substantial rigidity to the skull. Hodgson et al. (20) demonstrated this effect by statically compressing a cadaver's head in a universal testing machine and measuring its force-deflection with the brain cavity completely empty of brain material and completely filled with a silicone gel. In both cases, the force-deflection curves were linear which supports the simple head stiffness model given by Equation A 1 . The empty skull had a stiffness of 1595 N/mm. When it was completely filled with silicone gel, the stiffness increased to 7255 N/mm. The results of Hodgson et al. can be used to evaluate the effect that differences in the elastic bending modulus of the skull has on the head stiffness. Based on Hodgson's data, the skull stiffness of an adult is, ksi = 1595 N/mm and that of the brain is, kB1 = 7355 - 1595 = 5760 N/mm Consider now two skulls of equal dimensions, but with different bone bending moduli. Let the first skull have the elastic bending modulus of the adult given in Table 5, EB1 = 9.9 GPa and the second shall have the elastic bending modulus of the 3 year old, EB2 = 4.7 GPa which is a 53 percent reduction in skull bending modulus. Since the second skull was assumed to have the same dimensions as the first skull, its skull stiffness will be, k =^-k S2 _ KS1 B2 kS2 = 0.473(1595) = 754 N/mm kB] + kB2 = 5760 N/mm the combined stiffnesses of their skulls and brains are, ksi + kßi = 7355 N/mm (A2) ks2 + kB2 = 65 14 N/mm (A3) Assume that the flesh stiffnesses are equal and can be approximated as 1/2 of the combined stiffness of the first head given by Equation A2, or, kpi = kF2 = 3678 N/mm (A4) The stiffnesses of each head can be calculated using Equation Al and the stiffness values given in Equations A2, A3 and A4, or, kH1 = 2452 N/mm (A5) kH2 = 2358 N/mm (A6) Thus, a 53 percent reduction in skull bending modulus produces only a 4 percent reduction in head stiffness. Repeating the calculations with the elastic modulus of the cranial bone for the 6 year old child given in Table 5 gives reductions of head stiffness of 3 percent. Note that these reductions in head stiffness are upper bounds since the analysis did not take into account the increase in skull rigidity due to the reduction in head size for the children. 3562</page></plain_text>
