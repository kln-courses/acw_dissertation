JOSEPHINE McDONALD and ANNE ROSS Abstract In New South Wales the legal provisions for the protection of Aboriginal skeletal remains are clear. However, when human remains were discovered at the Aboriginal site of Angophora Reserve rocksheiter in Sydney, the situation became complex and confused as coronial investigations and legal procedures dominated archaeological methodology and principle. In this paper we discuss how normal archaeological techniques had to be modified, often beyond acceptable levels, because of the demands of the Coroner's Court. We also discuss the legal and moral ramifications of this case, and focus on the philosophical issue of identification and retention of archaeological Aboriginal skeletal remains when there is conflict between different groups of 'professionals'. We also provide some initial results from the excavation, and outline the methodological constraints which were introduced by external influences. The problems and political ramifications generated by this approach are discussed within the framework of archaeological research and cultural resource management. In March 1988 a schoolboy discovered human bones in a rocksheiter in Angophora Reserve. The find was reported to the police who, in the course of follow- up investigations, disturbed an Aboriginal site. In accordance with the provisions of the Coroner's Act 1980, the Coroner directed police to continue to delve into the deposits of the rocksheiter and surrounds for the purpose of revealing possible clues. Through the intervention of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (the Service) this hunt for clues became a systematic exercise, using convential archaeological techniques. Background Angophora Reserve is a small, densely vegetated recreation reserve on Bugola Plateau in the northern suburbs of Sydney (Fig. 1). It is administered by Warringah Shire Council. The reserve is on a steep slope, flanked by numerous sandstone outcrops. The site (coded ARI) is situated slightly to the western side of the Barranjoey Peninsula between Bugola Head (on the coast) and Taylors Point (on Pittwater). It is over 1.5km to the open seashore and less than 0.8km to the shoreline of Pittwater. The site is located more than half way up the Plateau and is some 80m above sea level. The site consists of a large overhang - 30m X 8m X 5m (at dripline).

Location of Angophora Reserve site. archaeological contents of the site include art (red and black drawings), burials and occupation deposit (midden, lithics, and faunal and floral remains). The archaeological deposit in the shelter extended over 17m X 7m, with a maximum excavated depth of 85cm (Fig. 2). The Service was not alerted to the fact that an Aboriginal site was being disturbed by police inves- tigations until a report was published in a local newspaper on 24 March 1988. By the time Service officers arrived at the site, police officers had already dug an area of 2m X 2m X 20cm deep. The police had found no further human bone although 2 small fragments of long bone were subsequently found on the police spoil heap by Service archaeologists. The human bones discovered by the schoolboy had been sent to the Coroner. The Government Medical Officer (GMO) and a dental anatomist had examined the bones and teeth and had concluded that the remains were those of a 5-year old non- Aboriginal child. The basis of this assessment was the absence of wear on the child's teeth, which the GMO and the dental anatomist concluded would not be expected in an Aboriginal child of this age. They further concluded that the absence of caries and the presence of what was believed to be epithelial tissue was evidence of death within the last two decades. The excellent dental health of the specimen was attributed to the fluoridation of Sydney's water supply.</page><page sequence="2">Intersection of back wall (base) and deposit ^^s^~' ^^^^^^^^^^^^j Ε^β ^ ' DenSe Stand °f PamPaS graSS °bSCUreS N ' ^&gt;^Hi9h ^^^^^^^ ^C i)··..

Site plan Most papers reported this interpretation as being the results of scientific analysis which had found that the teeth contained fluoride. No fluoride analysis had been done, however. Service archaeologists assisted police with their investigations for some time until it became evident that the Coroner wished a large part of the shelter to be investigated. It was realised that Service staff could not under- take excavations of the scale proposed by the Coroner. After a meeting with the Coroner and senior scientific squad detectives, it was agreed that a qualified archaeologist would be employed to excavate the site, and an Aboriginal consultant would be employed to liaise with the Aboriginal community. The Service made $22,000 available for this project, and the Police Department $8,000. The Coroner's office offered no financial or other assistance. McDonald was contracted by the Service to undertake this work. Archaeological excavation took place over a four week period in May and June 1988. Initially this salvage was envisaged as a two week excavation. The discovery within this period of a second child's remains necessitated an extension to the salvage project. The excavation When McDonald's team started at the site, an area of over 1 1 m2 had already been explored and it is estimated that approximately 2 m3 had been removed. All large bone was sent to the GMO during this time. The only other relics retained by Service personnel were the stone artefacts, even though these represent less than 5% of the cultural material at the site. This was due largely to the great haste of the investigation required by the Coroner. It also reflects an archaeological tradition in most excavated Sydney coastal sites (eg. Megaw 1974, Poiner 1974, Cox et al. 1968) where the stone artefacts are considered the most valuable indicators of culture and cultural change, while the shell and other associated material is either discarded or treated very superficially. As the major aim of the excavation was to assist the police with their investigations into a possible murder, the archaeological approach was tailored to suit their needs. Specifically, the police were interested in determining whether there were any signs of recent and suspicious disturbance and in locating any recent non-Aboriginal, human bone. For the police purposes of indicating disturbance, excavating the top 10-15 cm was considered sufficient. This depth of deposit was removed from an additional 19 m2. This and the earlier excavation resulted in over 40% of the floor area being investigated. To augment the shallow excavation required by the forensic approach, the Service also negotiated to have several squares systematically excavated to bedrock, in order to establish the site's nature and chronology. This was considered vital to ensure that the destruction of the site was not absolute and that the maximum information possible under the circumstances was obtained. Furthermore, it was considered that by establishing an archaeological context for the site, the conflict over the Aboriginality (or otherwise) of the human remains could be resolved. At the end of the first excavation period, the fragmentary presence of two prehistoric children was known. Both of these were between the ages of 3Vi and 5 years old. The Coroner felt that this evidence complicated the matter, and indeed there was no real evidence linking the original find with the two fragmented individuals. The excavation was therefore extended for another two weeks. McDonald's Brief again dictated that the surface be explored, particularly towards the front of the deposit where local residents had reported human bones being found in the early 1970s. However, on archaeological grounds it appeared that the only way to test whether or not the fragmentary bone on the surface was recent was to discover whether similar fragments occurred in situ at depth. Therefore, an area of the site which had been already tested on the surface (and found to be undisturbed) was further excavated to the base of the midden layer. This resulted in another three individuals being located at the site, two of these adult and the other a 6 month old baby. One of the adults, a female, was found fully articulated at the junction of the midden and the occupation layer. The remains of the baby were found in close proximity to the woman and it is 115</page><page sequence="3">considered that they were probably buried at the same time, and that they were mother and child. The conclusion regarding the temporal and social asso- ciation between these two burials is based on several ethnohistorical accounts from the Sydney area relating to the Aboriginal custom of burying a baby at the breast with its mother if the latter died. The most detailed account is that of Collins: When the [mother's] body was placed in the grave, the [British] bystanders were amazed to see the father himself place the living child in it with the mother. Having laid the child down, he threw upon it a large stone, and the grave was instantly filled in by the other natives. ... [The father], so far from thinking it inhuman, justified the extraordinary act by assuring us that as no woman could be found to nurse the child, it must die a much worse death than that to which he had put it. As a similar circumstance occurred a short time after, we have every reason to suppose the custom always prevails among them. (1798, 607- 608). Following the discovery of this obviously prehistoric material, and despite opposition from the GMO, excavation ceased. Results A total of one hundred and thirty three (133) person . days were spent at the site during the excavation - ninety-four (94) of these being archaeological person days (many of the assistants were police officers). Over 9 tonnes of deposit were removed from the site in the course of the investigation. This includes that material removed by Service staff. From almost 7 tonnes of deposit a total of 336 kg of cultural material has been retained for analysis. Only a small percentage of this material has been analysed (McDonald 1990) and full analysis and publication of the site will take considerable time. Consequently in this paper we summarise the results of analyses to date in so far as they pertain to the interaction between archaeological and political issues at the site. These data have been included here because of their relevance to the current issue, the importance of this site and the criticism regularly levelled at archaeological consultants regarding the lack of published CRM material. Stratigraphy. The deposit at the site overlies a sandstone ledge (bedrock), which is fully exposed at the front of the shelter due to dripline activity. Bedrock is at a maximum (excavated) depth of 85 cm below the existing surface level. The surface of the deposit is extremely uneven and when the archaeological fieldwork commenced was considerably compacted. This compaction is no doubt due to the extreme treadage the site has experienced since the police investigations commenced. Photographs of the site taken in 1978 (N.P.W.S. Head Office Site Register) indicate that the surface prior to the investigation was characterised by loose fine deposit, but still uneven. This condition of deposit was observed immediately adjacent to the back wall at the commencement of this work. There appear to be three stratigraphie layers present across the site; Layers I, II and III. Two of these, Layers I and III, are interpreted as indicating distinctive cultural phases, while Layer II is an interface zone indicating a mixing of the other two layers. The basal deposits of Layer III are also affected by soil formation processes, i.e. colour and textural differences of geological, non-cultural causes. Layer I is characterised by the presence of shell and bone, and for the purposes of discussion is named 'the midden layer'. The interface layer (so called) contains appreciably less shell and bone material. Layer III is called the brown sandy clay layer. Figure 3 is a stratigraphie drawing from the site. The midden layer (I) appears to represent a period of intensive occupation and comprises an organic rich, dark brown-black humic layer. Shell, bone and plant material are well preserved within this layer, and it is rich in charcoal. Present within this layer are complex areas, replete with archaeological features such as hearths and arranged hearth stones, and pits and/or areas of scuffage which transect older hearths Fig. 3. Stratigraphy: north/south cross section through part of the site 116</page><page sequence="4">but which have been subsequently overlain by later horizontal layers. In several areas of the site, areas of white clay mixed with burnt shell and/or ash are present. Both the in situ cranium in area 5B and the fully extended burial were 'protected' by these cappings, indicating that these individuals are indis- putably prehistoric in age. The direct association between the capping and the buried remains is only partially demonstrated, and an alternative explanation for the function of these features is heat treatment of stone artefacts. At the interface (II) between the midden and lower layer is deposit, of variable depth, which represents the disturbance of the earlier occupation layer by subsequent use of the shelter. This interpretation is preferred to that of a transitional (i.e. cultural) zone. It would appear likely that there was a hiatus of site use (either functional or temporal) rather than a gradual change from one on to the other (McDonald 1990). The colour of this layer is lighter than the midden (this varying between squares) and there are organic remains present. The brown sandy clay layer (III) contains small quantities only of shell or bone. Stone artefacts and charcoal, however, are found throughout this layer, to within a few centimetres of bedrock. At the base of this layer the stratum grades into yellow sandy clay. In direct contact with bedrock, this changes to a blue/grey to white clay (gleyed clay?), the consistency and colour of which appears to be controlled by the amount of local water retention. The thickness of the yellow clay layer varies across the shelter, being thicker towards the rear wall. Artefacts are found within the yellow clay, although in very low densities. Dates. The charcoal dates have been obtained from one of the control squares dug to bedrock (Table 1). The 10D/3/1 sample was taken from the macrozamia pit (see below); the 10D/11/1 sample from the base of the white clay cap adjacent to the extended burial; the 10D/18/1 sample from the basal clay, several cm above bedrock. The aparent inconsistency of the lower two dates has yet to be investigated. Within one standard deviation they are 'the same' and given the depth and nature of the lower deposit, it is felt that a spontaneous buildup would not have been likely. Modern groundwater seepage along the sandstone shelf may well have contaminated the lower sample. A charcoal sample from slightly higher in the sequence has been submitted in an attempt to resolve this problem.

Radiocarbon dates from Angophora Reserve rocksheiter Preservation. The preservation of archaeological material in the midden layer is excellent. This is due to the generally dry condition of this layer and the high pH (alkaline: commonly between 8 and 9.5). The excellent preservation conditions in the upper levels have resulted in the generally good conditions of the shells, bone and other organic matter. For instance, many of the hairy mussels retain their 'hair' and many other shells still have attached pieces of seaweed and other organic matter. On the whole the colour and general structure of the shells is preserved and the incidence of fully bleached and flaky shell is low. The condition of bone varies remarkably across the site, with human, animal and bird bone demon- strating the full range of preservation. This range includes: 'fresh': whitish/yellow unstained bone; light brown: slightly stained, some post- depositional erosion; brown: stained, usual bone colour in archae- ological context, extremely well preserved; red-brown: very lustrous surface, appears to be the result of staining - possibly from macrozamia?; burnt: blackened as a result of charring; calcined: blue/white as a result of extreme heat. It has been .thought that the upper levels of the midden must be of extremely recent age, due to this excellent preservation. The date of 1150 ± 100 BP for the upper levels, however, indicates that this is not so. The site was obviously a multi-purpose one which was revisited over a considerable time period. There is evidence for hunting, fishing, gathering and processing at the site as well as general site organi- sation, manufacturing, artistic behaviour and disposal of the dead. This deposit can reveal a wealth of information about the economy of the people living around Pittwater in prehistoric times. Given that this type of analysis has not been undertaken on the western seaboard of the Tasman Sea, the significance of the site and the potential of the material is increased. The burials and other human skeletal remains. In order to provide as much detail as possible of the human remains excavated at the site, field notes and bone identification were made during the excavation. These descriptions were hampered by the imperfect nature of field conditions, and by the fact that a trained biological anthropologist was only on site during the first 10 days of the excavation. A report by Colin Pardoe (1988) discussed the remains found in the first field session. Unfortunately, Pardoe was not present when the extended burial, baby and other adult individuals were discovered. Pardoe's report states clearly that he considers the human material, particularly the original finds, is 'to [his] eye, indisputably Aboriginal - both archae- ologically and anatomically. They are explicable from our excavations in their distribution and preservation. The tooth wear, ground erosion and consistency with the in situ fragments can only point to prehistoric Aboriginal' (1988: i-ii). This conclusion is based on the following peints: 1. The tooth wear on the original finds. The wear of the teeth is minimal but definitely present. Ground- water erosion has destroyed some of the jaw. 117</page><page sequence="5">bush rat and dingo. A minimum number of 37 individuals was counted. Sea mammals, reptiles, amphibia, birds and crustácea are poorly represented components of the vertebrate assemblage (0.5% of the bone present). These rare species include the Australian fur seal, diamond python, a tortoise, mutton bird and the Little Penguin. A minimum of 18 individual specimens was counted. Fish remains at the site include most skeletal parts (eg. vertebrae, spines, ribs, dentaries) as well as otoliths and scales. Seventeen species of fish were identified from the fish bone at the site. A total of 93 individual specimens was counted. Snapper is the dominant species (57% MNI; 70% by weight). Wrasse (7.5%) and Black Bream (10%) are the only two other species which are present in any significant number. Wood has commented (1989:80) that the majority of the fish material appears to derive from small individuals (i.e. &lt; 28cm). Wood has estimated the dietary contribution of each of these faunal classes (1989:76-83) and compared this to dietary estimates made for the molluscan assemblage (McDonald 1990:134-42). These calcu- lations indicate that while the molluscan remains dominate the cultural material (by weight), these would only have provided 1% of the calories repre- sented by the site's remains. Terrestrial mammals would have provided 91%; fish 7%; and the other combined classes 1%. The significance of these findings are discussed at length elsewhere (McDonald 1990: sections 6 and 7; Wood 1989: chapter 6). Plant material. Fragmentary and burnt plant remains were found throughout the midden layer. The most common of these were fragments of paper bark and burnt seeds (predominantly Banksia spp and Casuarina spp). The seed husks of the cycad Burrawang (Macrozamia communis) were found throughout the midden layer. In square 10D a pit/hearth with approximately 30 of the fleshy inner seed linings were found. It is thought that this may be evidence of the roasting of these seeds as part of the detoxification process. Stone, bone and shell artefacts. The stone artefact assemblage is largely amorphous with very few diagnostic pieces. Bipolar technology is much in evidence, as is the use of unspecialised flakes and flaked pieces as implements. Only a few fragments with evidence of grinding were observed during sorting. A total of 5,715 artefacts was recovered from the material so far analysed. The majority of these (78%) were located in the midden layer. Only two backed blades were found at the site, both in square 10D. One was located from the base of Layer III, the other in the interface layer. The absence of this artefact type in the midden layer is in keeping with the age determinations for the site, and distribution patterns for this artefact type else- where in the Sydney region (eg. Attenbrow 1987; McDonald 1989). One resin-mounted microlith was discovered at the site, but this has not yet been analysed. Also present in the midden layer are the products of bone-working technology. These take the form of both formalised tool types (bone points: the pointed as opposed to the spatulate form) and the more ad hoc use of shaped pieces of bone, several examples 2. The discovery of the (first) burial pit with parts of the skull in situ (undisturbed). Beside this was a second, fairly recent pit dug partly into the grave pit. The burial is clearly prehistoric. It is covered by other archaeological features and is dug into earlier layers in a fashion only interpretable in this way. In other words, it was not possible from someone 20 years ago (say) to dig a hole, bury a child and cover the hole with sediments that are consistent over much of the area we dug. 3. The in situ skull has been disturbed by the second pit, such that the left, front part of the head was in its original position, while the right side, back and teeth have been scattered by the digging. These latter pieces are those which were found close to the surface. 4. The preservation of all the bones discovered is similar. They were eroded - together in the ground - by the same processes. 5. The second skull fragment discovered is probably also Aboriginal on the basis of preservation: its relationship to the original mandible is unknown. Occupation deposit. A total of 118.4 kg of cultural material has been sorted and analysed (McDonald 1990, Wood 1989). This material comprises shell, bone (fish and terrestrial mammals), plant remains and stone, bone and shell artefacts. These will be briefly described. Shell. A total of 68 kg of shell was retrieved from the analysed squares at the site. By weight this component represent 58% of the cultural material. Thirty-three molluscan species have been identified across the site, twenty-three of these being considered of edible size and species. The species found indicate that shellfish collection took place on either side of the Barranjoey peninsula. There is a full range of estuarine, rock platform and open beach species represented. Both of these resource areas are roughly equidistant from the site - the elevation from both is over 80 m - and such a finding would not be unexpected. The dominant species suggest, however, that there may have been a preference for estuarine shellfish collection. The dominant species by weight are Crassostrea commercialis (Sydney rock oyster) 51%, Trichomya hirsuta (Hairy mussel) 21%, and Anadara trapezia (Cockle) 10%. By counting the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), Crassostrea and Trichomya still dominate, but there is a stronger showing by many of the smaller species (cf. Nerita (Black periwinkle), Chama fibula (Spiny oyster), and Velacumantis (small whelk)). No Mytilus edulis (edible mussel) occurs at the site. Faunal material. Slightly less than 5 kg of faunal material was located in the material so far analysed, this representing 4.1% (by weight) of the cultural material recovered. A detailed analysis of this material was completed by Wood (1989). Her results are summarised here. The majority of the bone was of terrestrial mam- malian species, twenty-three species of which were identifiable. Swamp wallabies, the Eastern Grey kangaroo and the red-necked wallaby dominate the assemblage. Also present are a variety of smaller macropods, possums and gliders, dasyuridae, echidna, 118</page><page sequence="6">of which appear to have been flaked in much the same manner as pieces of stone. Several of the bone points may be the snapped barbs of fishing spears, and one has use wear/polish that may indicate that it has been used in basket or net making (Kim Akerman per. comm.). No fishhooks or fishhook files were found at the site. The fact that a large amount of fish bone, scales and otoliths are present suggests that fish were procured by methods other than linefishing. The early date for the top of the midden layer supports other evidence from the south-east coast that hook technology occurs more recently than 800 BP (McDonald 1989). Anadara shells which have been utilised (probably as scrapers) were found throughout the midden layer. This implement type was also discovered on the western side of Pittwater, at the Great Mackerel Site in Ku-ring-gai Chase (McDonald 1989). The use of shells as implements is well documented by the first European settlers in the Sydney area (eg. Collins 1798, Tench 1793). Art. The art consists of faded charcoal and red ochre drawings at the western end of the site. The art panal is located quite high on the wall and is quite separate from the main floor area. The art has been traced on polythene, a process which revealed that the red drawings were of two kangaroos and a fish, while the charcoal drawings were of small anthropomorphic figures. An area of silica wash covers the latter. Identification prior to tracing was difficult due to the art's faded nature. Archaeological implications There are numerous research possibilities which result from the excavation of the site. The amount and variety of material, as well as the areal extent of its collection has produced a unique sample with enormous archaeological potential. There are, however, several disadvantages which arise from the method and speed of collection. 1. A total of 133 person days were spent excavating the site. Of these 94 were archaeological person days. The speed with which the excavation progressed has meant that many stratigraphie and contextual details have been lost. 2. There were a minimum of four and a maximum of 28 people on site every day. This had an obvious progressive impact on the condition of the site. 3. While only 40% of the floor area was investigated, more than 70% of the deposit with depth has been excavated either partially or fully. And the area dug was that considered to have the greatest potential, being in the centre and the driest and deepest area of the deposit. In other words, there is very little left for future archaeologists to excavate. The fact that such a large area of the site was opened up and because the majority of the archae- ological material was retained means that there is an enormous sample of a well preserved coastal-mixed economy site. Indeed, had the Coroner's authority to investigate the possibility of an indictable crime not had priority over the Director's responsibility for Aboriginal relics, nowhere near this sample would have been allowed to be excavated. That this sample was rapidly and imperfectly collected diminishes its worth somewhat. However, the conclusion which must be reached is that never before in New South Wales has such a large sample with such potential resulted from a salvage excavation. Political ramifications Aboriginal people were predictably concerned at the way in which the excavations at Angophora Reserve proceeded. A representative of the Metro- politan Local Aboriginal Land Council was employed to liaise between the archaeologists, police and the Aboriginal community. As expected, the Land Council was unhappy about the excavation of a large number of human skeletons from an Aboriginal site. Nevertheless, they agreed that, given the possibility that a child had been murdered, the police and Coroner needed to investigate the site as much as possible. They also supported the Service's stand, that a 'scientific' excavation be a component of the exercise, so that the full history of the site could be revealed. The community were saddened by the discovery of the burial of the mother and baby, and angered by the insensitive actions of the GMO towards these people. This anger resulted from the following incident: After the on-site meeting on 20 June 1988 - attended by the archaeologists, Service staff, police scientific officers, representatives of the Coroner and members of the Aboriginal community - it was agreed that no further excavation of the site was needed. It was agreed that the extended burial of the mother and child had no revelance to a coronial inquest and that the Coronor did not require the bones. It was agreed that the Service would back-fill the site on Friday 24 June, 1988. The Service, however, decided that the site would be backfilled a day earlier and archaeologists arrived at the site on Thursday around 12.00 noon. Soon after, the GMO arrived and began removing bone from the baby's skeleton. When challenged, he declared that the dental anatomist required these bones for his analysis. The GMO was advised that there had been an agreement that these bones were not required and that they should be returned to the site. The GMO complied. As a result of several similarly insensitive actions on the part of the Coroner's staff, the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council refused the request from the Coroner's expert to do detailed research on these skeletons, and strongly supported the Service's advice that the mother and baby should remain in the ground, and that the remainder of the bones, still held by the Coroner, should be returned. The Aboriginal community has remained re- markably tolerant of the current situation and has generally supported all the actions of the Service. Nevertheless, a letter from the State Land Council regarding the Coroner's continued retention of Aboriginal remains indicates that this tolerance has limits. Co-operation from the Coronial staff throughout this case has been poor. For instance: - • The Coroner originally opposed Service involve- ment in investigations. The Service only discovered 119</page><page sequence="7">by accident that the site was to be 'dug up': the police mistakenly believed the Service owned Angophora Reserve and rang the Director to advice him of police activities. • The Coroner has never offered any funds to cover the expenses of the operation. • The Coroner insisted that the excavation of the rock shelter should continue long after archaeologists reported that the site was an Aboriginal burial site and even after the police advised that there was no chance of any non- Aboriginal material being found by further site destruction. • The GMO and his 'expert' have refused to discuss their analyses or their findings with the Service, the archaeologists or the biological anthropologist. We understand that several analyses have been under- taken. We have heard that all bone has been x-rayed as well as being sent to Lucas Heights for fluoride analyses. We have not been able to discuss whether or not such analyses are appropriate to the issues at hand, nor have we been informed of the results or implications of these analyses. • The Coroner continued to retain bags of animal bone and human bone removed from the site, despite admitting that only one bone was suspected of being Caucasian, and despite repeated written requests from the Service for their return. When bones were finally returned in November 1989, a large number were found to be missing. Written requests for the missing bones to be located and returned have not been answered. The main issues raised by the Angophora Reserve case relate to the relationships between the various legislations which impinge on site protection and different levels of information needed under the various Acts as they affect Aboriginal sites. The legal position: a conclusion There are two pieces of legislation in New South Wales which are relevant to the investigation of human skeletal remains. These are the Coroner's Act 1980 and the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. In the 1989 amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 'boriginal skeletal remains are explicitly included in the definition of a 'relic'. The Act goes on to provide that all relics in New South Wales are protected (section 85) and cannot be damaged, defaced or destroyed (section 90) or excavated (section 86) without the consent of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. The Coroner's Act, on the other hand, provides for an inquest to be held into the death of any individual who has died and/or is buried in New South Wales, provided the death is believed to be exaninable by the Coroner (section 13 (1)). An examinable death includes: violent or unnatural death (13 (3) a); sudden death, the cause of which is unknown (13 (3) b); and cases in which a medical practitioner has not provided a certificate as to the cause of death (13 (3) d). The provisions of section 13 (3) d mean that theoretically, all prehistoric and early historic Aboriginal burials should be investigated by the Coroner. There is no provision at present for dis- pensing with an inquest into such ancient remains. Nevertheless, it is not a requirement of the Coroner's Act that the discovered remains be removed from the place where they were found, nor that the Coroner see the remains, at least in the first instance. Prior to 1986, the Service had become increasingly concerned at police action which resulted in the 'excavation' of Aboriginal skeletal remains, and their removal to the Coroner's Court for investigation by the GMO, without any reference to the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. In this, the police were acting in accordance with the Coroner's Act, but in contravention of the National Parks and Wildlife Act. In the early 1980's, police and Service staff began negotiations aimed at resolving this conflict. The result was the publication of The Skeleton Manual (Thorne and Ross 1986). This had a twofold aim: to assist police, National Parks officers and other relevant people to identify Aboriginal skeletal material from the prehistoric past or early historic period without unnecessarily disturbing or ex- cavating them ... [and] set out procedures for dealing with any Aboriginal skeletal material found. (Thorne and Ross 1986:1). With the production of this manual the Service believed that major problems with the inadvertant desecration of bones by police would be resolved. For the main part, the problems were greatly reduced until the Angophora Reserve incident. There are a number of differences between the Angophora Reserve case and other situations involving the location of burials. These are as follows: 1. At Angophora Reserve the Service was involved well after the initial find of the human remains had been made; 2. The bones had already been sent to the Coroner; and, 3. There was a dispute about the Aboriginality of the finds. The principal effect of these factors was that with Angophora Reserve, the Service was dealing with the Coroner's Court as well as the Police Department. Up until this time, the Service had believed that these two departments were one, or at least, closely related. It quickly became obvious that this was not the case. Not only is the Coroner's Court in a different ministerial portfolio (Attorney General) from the police, but the police clearly hold the Coroner in some awe. All Service negotiations with the police, and all the provisions spelt out in The Skeleton Manual were ignored if a dictum from the Coroner contradicted that arrangement. The problem was that the Service had no procedural arrangements with the Coroner's office. There have been attempts over the past 12 - 18 months by the Service to establish formal procedures with the Coroner regarding Aboriginal skeletal remains. There is agreement that in future, where the Aboriginality of remains is disputed, a committee of experts, involving physical anthropologists, will de- termine the situation. Determination will no longer be by the GMO and forensic pathologists alone. However, these procedures still require the human remains to be 'excavated' and sent to the morgue. All 120</page><page sequence="8">efforts by the Service to continue negotiation with the present Coroner have so far been unsuccessful. This has been due, in part, to the Coroner's extremely pressured workload: for instance, the investigations into the two worst road disasters in Australian history and the death of David Gundy. At a political level, resolution of conflict over some Old bones' is of very much less importance than public outcry over road conditions and police raids. The Service is, therefore, once again dealing primarily with the Police Department in an effort to prevent Aboriginal remains being sent to the Coroner at all. Some recent successes in this area, particularly regarding an input by the Service into police training programmes, gives us some cause for optimism. Conclusion At Angophora Reserve the archaeological investi- gation of an Aboriginal site was directly controlled by the Coroner. We note that the Coroner's Act does not override the National Parks and Wildlife Act as such. But the Coroner's Act makes it clear that the Coroner must fully investigate a possible indictable crime in sufficient detail to make a determination as to the cause of death, the identity of victim and the making of any criminal charge. The main problem in this case, however, was not the legislation, but the Coroner's refusal to believe that his experts were in fact not experts in this case. The Coroner's experts were not in a postion to understand the stratigraphie evidence which indicated excavation should have ceased at least two weeks earlier than it did; they only finally agreed to cease because of pressure from the police who had been involved in the excavation. But, more seriously, neither the GMO nor the other 'expert' involved on this project has experience in applied physical anthropology, or Aboriginal morphology. They have refused all offers of assistance from the Service in their analysis of the disputed bones, and have made several errors in analysis owing to their lack of expertise in this area. This has lead to the situation of the Coroner holding Aboriginal remains unnecessarily. Acknowledgements The fieldwork was undertaken by McDonald, variously assisted by Terry Bonhomme, Colin Pardoe, Dominic Steele and Paul Tacon as well as Sarah Colley, Helen Cooke, Ingereth MacFarlane and Vivienne Wood. Isabel McBryde visited the site and generously gave of her time and talents with latex. NPWS personnel to take part in the excavation during this time were Bronwyn Conyers, Sherri-Lee Evans, Carol Gartside, Luke Godwin and Ian Johnson. Police personnel on site during this time included Phil Floeghel and David Forbes (Chatswood Scientific Squad) and Neil Hill, Tony Keeling and Patsy Thomson (Mona Vale Detectives). Bob Perry from the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council visited the site on numerous occasions. Other members of the Aboriginal community, Cliff Foley, Harry Mumbulla, îpary Williams and Don Tomkins, also visited the site. Over 50% of the material collected from the site has now been sorted. Thanks for this are largely due to Wilfred Shawcross and his B-30 class at ANU, and Vivienne Wood. John Head and Lois Taylor (ANU Radiocarbon Lab) processed the dates from this site very quickly.
