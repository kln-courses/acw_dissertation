<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LANGUAGE OF THE PENTATEUCH IN ITS RELATION TO EGYPTIAN" ANY biblical study which is sincerely devoted to finding the truth is welcomed by scientific scholars. Dr. Yahuda has an interesting theme, but he was not the first one to notice the accurate knowledge of Egyptian conditions on the part of the author of the Joseph story and the Exodus narrative. Certain Egyptian derivatives or philological connections between Egyptian and Semitic languages had also been pointed out before. As is well known, the Graf-Wellhausen theory has during recent years received many hard and severe blows, but the attacks have been launched not only from the Egyptological quarter. In fact, even though we should accept Ya.huda's thesis of early authorship in por- tions of the Pentateuch, it would still be possible for a later author or redactor to incorporate an early Egypto-Hebrew source into one of the documents of the Pentateuch which are assumed by the school of Wellhausen. As a philologist, Yahuda is, however, not always fortunate. He says (xxxvi-xxxvii): "We shall examine in the first place the expressions and phrases which are to be encountered in no other Semitic language, but occur alike in the Pentateuch and in Egyptian, chiefly those words and phrases which are only to be found in the Pentateuch, very rarely also elsewhere in the Bible, and which are of Egyptian origin." A cursory examination of some of his citations shows that he has carried his point too far and that in some instances he forgot to consult the other Semitic languages or was not aware of certain idioms outside of Hebrew and Egyptian. On pp. 8-9, he discusses nltlD, "a thing borne"="a gift." This is such an obvious semantic development that there is no need of going to Egyptian for the source of this usage. Likewise (pp. 10-11), the significance of In] and D'l "set," "put," in the sense of appointment to office, is such an obvious idiom that we need not assume an Egyptian provenance. The infinitive absolute in Gen. 41.43 as a substitute for the finite verb is a construction well 1 The Language of the Pentateuch in Its Relation to Egyptian. With a Hieroglyphic Appendix. Volume I.

The conjunction 1 before p1ln furthermore is against Yahuda's strange interpretation, which he calls the "correct translation": "And they called out l1:3 before him and that he was to be set (by command of the king) over the whole land of Egypt." Moreover in Gen. 43.16, we have a series of imperatives and not an imperative followed by an infinitive, as Yahuda asserts. So his confident observation of Egyptian influence in these passages is not correct. On pp. 11-12, his explanation on "make to stand" ="let live" (Ex. 9.16) is extremely doubtful. Egyptian 'h' means "to stand," but all of Yahuda's examples involve only the nominal use of the root, in which the meaning is evident. He quotes one example of a verb, s'nb "keep alive," but here he cites a different root, which means "to live" and which therefore undergoes no semantic development. In treating (pp. 12-13) "recount," "praise" = "glorify," his examples from the Egyptian do not prove his point. In his discussion of "mouth" (pp. 42-44), Yahuda draws a com- parison from r' "mouth," the title of a high office at the court of Pharaoh, while ntr, D'nIk, is applied to Pharaoh, since he was deified. In Ex. 4.16, Aaron was to be a mouth to Moses, and Moses was to be to him as God. Just as r; was lower than ntr, so Aaron was inferior to Moses. At first sight, it may appear that the writer has made a good point, but he misses one thing: the religious conception of Hebrew prophecy. Just as the prophet was the spokesman of God, so Aaron was the spokesman of Moses. The Hebrew idea of prophecy would naturally in this connection place Moses in the place of God, in a relative sense. In Pharaoh, meaning "the great house" (p. 44), modern analogies could have been drawn from "the Holy See" and "the Sublime Porte." In Chapter III, he uses the title "Ordinary Expressions and Phrases Modelled on Egyptian." In this connection, he begins with "hear" for "understand." Now the transition from hear to understand is very evident. The same usage is found also in Arabic and Syriac. When Yahuda derives such an obvious semantic development within Hebrew from the Egyptian, it is apparent that he will grasp at anything to support his theory of the influence of Egyptian upon Hebrew. He does not seem to realize that people of all nations have ideas which are expressed in words and that in many cases various languages have the same psychology. If an idea occurs in Egyptian, it does not necessarily imply that a similar idea in Hebrew must have been borrowed from Egyptian. 254</page><page sequence="3">PENTATEUCH IN RELATION TO EGYPTIAN-GEHMAN 255 On p. 52, he discusses D'33 for "true, honest men." Egyptian m?" means "upright," "correct," "true"; m'.ty "correct," "upright," "virtuous" comes from this root. ]13 fundamentally signifies "to stand upright." It also connotes "to be set up, established," "to be firm." 1] "right," "veritable," "honest" is derived from this same root. Somehow Yahuda does not seem to understand that we have the same idea in both literatures and that both languages had words to express it. On p. 61, in connection with "lift up the head" (Gen. 40.13), he draws a parallel from Egyptian ritual speech, where to lift up or elevate the head "was quite usual for awakening the dead to new life." But what shall we say about Gen. 40.19, where in speaking to the baker, Joseph said: "Within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee"? On pp. 66-67, Yahuda considers hand and arm as symbols of strength and the finger of God. These idioms are perfectly clear, when we bear in mind the Hebrew anthropomorphic conception of God. It is not clear why (pp. 70-71) he derives the use of "bone," "limb" "self" from Egyptian. Aramaic garama and Syriac garmd are used in exactly the same sense. Arabic . "eye" has a similar usage. In connection with the rainbow (Gen. 9.13 ff.), the author maintains (p. 215) that while nIp, is a common Semitic word, only in Egyptian is the word used for both a shooting weapon and an arc in the sky; from this source he derives the Hebrew usage. The fact is that Ethiopic qast has the twofold meaning, but in Arabic and Syriac the noun is modified by a qualifying genitive to express the idea of "rainbow." Some of this work, however, has linguistic merit. Thus the name of Joseph n3yD Il!Dt is well interpreted (p. 33) as "food, sustenance of the land is the living" or "is this living one." The good features of the book, however, are vitiated, and confidence is shaken by numerous ab- surdities, as has been pointed out above. While Yahuda admits Babylonian elements, he thinks that certain stories and narratives had come to the Hebrews long before the Hebrew- Egyptian period; that they had been current for many generations in the Canaanite dialect, and that during the sojourn of Israel in Egypt they underwent numerous alterations under their new environment. In this way, came about the predominance of Egyptian influence in the Pentateuch. The heterogeneous alien elements in the Genesis stories and the patriarchal narratives, according to Yahuda, are a product of a milieu where Hebrews and Egyptians lived side by side. He concludes (p. 293): "Hence it becomes clear that also the literary</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW form in which they have come down to us could only have been attained at a time when Hebrew was at the end of the process of its independent development from the primitive Canaanite dialect under Egyptian influence, and had reached perfection as a literary language." After all, however, the Pentateuch is a Semitic book both in psychol- ogy and in language. One cannot help feeling that the early chapters of Genesis are Semitic in their background and not Egyptian. There is no doubt that Yahuda's work contains a great deal of excellent material. It would indeed be surprising if Hebrew contained no Egyptian influ- ence, especially in view of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt and the long and successful Egyptian penetration of Palestine. If the author had employed more exact philological methods and not carried his view so unreasonably far in various citations, his arguments might have been more convincing. If a student wishes to quote any of Yahuda's etymologies or parallels, it is very important that he first verify them most carefully in Erman-Grapow's Worterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache and in the lexicons of the various Semitic languages. The work has much interesting material, but it has to be used with extreme caution. HENRY SNYDER GEHMAN Princeton Theological Seminary and Princeton University 256</page></plain_text>
