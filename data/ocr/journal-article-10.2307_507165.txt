<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS ter. The views of numerous scholars are presented and there are useful ideas and insights. For example, the discussion of the forms and contexts of pottery bearing the figure-of-eight shield motif convincing demonstrates that the motif is not simply "decorative" but has a contex- tually meaningful symbolic dimension; similarly the prob- able relationship between bull games, sacrifice, and the finished shield is highlighted. As a whole, however, the discussion suffers from the lack of any consistent frame- work for "reading" iconography. The discussion comprises four categories: palladia, cult objects, shields in processional contexts, and symbolic use (in association with other symbols). Given the com- plexity of Aegean iconography, it is not at all clear that such categories are useful. Some images incorporate the shield with the head, arms, and sometimes feet of an anthropomorphic form, in other words, the palladion. The interesting suggestion is made that short, horizon- tal strokes either side of the shield's "waist" might be understood as arms and therefore belong with this group. The loops and rosettes at the top of the shield are tak- en to be stylized heads, whereas other scholars see them as a means of hanging the shield. The "palladion" imag- es are accepted as relating to a goddess of war, who is also considered to have protective qualities and to be related to the domain of fertility and the regeneration of nature. The wider symbolism of the shield is also interpreted as referring to this goddess; for example, a sacerdotal role in the service of a "goddess of war" is attributed to the female burial with gold rings bearing shields from Archanes. The larger problems of defining and thinking about female divinity in the Bronze Age are presumably con- sidered beyond the scope of the study but should not be ignored. The association of goddesses with the realm of warfare in Mycenaean iconography, and especially at Mycenae, seems largely unproblematic (see most re- cently P. Rehak, "The Mycenaean 'Warrior Goddess' Revisited," in Polemos, edited by R. Laffineur, 227-37 [Liege 1999]). The same cannot easily be argued for the much more ambiguous and complicated imagery from Crete. The concentration of shield imagery at Knossos is also striking and needs to be considered in relation to the special Knossian use of bull imagery. Marinatos's analyses of sets of symbols (shield, bucra- nium, garment impaled triangle) as symbols for hunt- ing and sacrifice deserved fuller discussion, as does consideration of the potential for images to be polyse- mic and metaphoric. This is a useful study of a distinctively Aegean artifact type, although the full significance of the figure-of- eight shield still remains in part enigmatic. The book will be primarily of relevance to Aegean prehistorians, and also of interest to Homerists and to specialists in martial matters.

Pp. xx + 378, figs. 148, color pls. 56. British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, London 1998. $54. ISBN 1-898249-11-3 (cloth). This is a wonderful book, rich with scientific informa- tion as well as reminiscences about the aims and results achieved by the British Institute of Archaeology at Anka- ra (BIAA) during its first 50 years. Inaugurated in 1948 in Ankara, the first of the foreign research institutes to open in the capital of the Turkish Republic instead of in Istanbul, the BIAA has taken advantage of its central location and pursued projects in all corners of the coun- try. The contributors comprise a distinguished list of re- searchers, including the editor, Roger Matthews, the current Director of the BIAA. Much regretted, however, is the self-imposed absence of David French, Director from 1968 to 1993, whose great knowledge of the topog- raphy, archaeology, and history of Turkey has been fun- damental to the achievements of the BIAA. The list of contributors reveals an additional absence: only one of the 27 authors is a woman, an indication of how much the BIAA has been a masculine preserve. Turkish women archaeologists, in contrast, have been directing field projects for decades. Research sponsored by the BIAA has taken on its own distinctive character. Its most influential work has been in the revealing of Neolithic settlements, in making clear the value of the surface survey and the multidisciplinary approach to archaeological field research, and in explor- ing Roman and Byzantine provincial art and archaeology. In contrast with other research institutions, both Turkish and foreign, the BIAA never settled down for long-term excavations at a large Bronze Age or Classical site. In- stead, with the one exception of Gatal H6yuik, the BIAA has preferred short-term explorations at a variety of sites and has long promoted the surface survey as a worthy scientific endeavor. Catal Ho6yik has been the most spectacular site exca- vated under the auspices of the BIAA. With Mellaart's excavations first at Hacilar, then at (atal H6yuk, the Neolithic past of Turkey came dramatically to light. Mel- laart writes here about his pioneering work at these two sites and at Beycesultan. I. Hodder and R. Matthews con- tinue the story from 1993, when excavations resumed after a hiatus of nearly 30 years. Other scholars have done research in the Palaeolithic and Neolithic: T. Wat- kins's excavations at Pinarbasi in the Konya Plain have documented a predecessor and neighbor of Catal H6yiuk; I. Todd's Central Anatolian Survey of 1964-1966 brought Asikli H6yik to scholarly attention (under excavation since 1989 by Istanbul University's Ufuk Esin); and A. Garrard's 1995-1996 survey between Maras and Gaziantep has located many early prehistoric sites. Although an aim of the BIAA's founder,John Garstang, was to promote research on the Hittites, the best-known British contributions to Hittitology have come not in archaeology but in philology and epigraphy, with the work of O. Gurney andJ. D. Hawkins. Yet archaeological re- 800 [AJA 104</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS search in the Bronze and Iron Ages has been fruitful, with results coming in from the west of Turkey (the Madra Gay Delta), the center (the Kerkenes Dag Project and the Paphlagonian Survey), the south (Kilise Tepe), the southeast (Sultantepe), and the far east (in Urartian ter- ritory). A significant vehicle has been BIAA participation in the rescue excavations along the Euphrates in areas eventually flooded after the construction of dams, first at Asvan near Elazig, later at Tille Hoyuk in Adiyaman prov- ince. The Asvan Project, conceived by D. French, was of paramount importance for the formulation of a multidis- ciplinary approach to understanding the environment, ancient and modern. One of the founding fathers of the BIAA, S. Lloyd, in a lecture assessing the BIAA's first 25 years (AnatSt 24 [1974] 197-220), called this an "unfa- miliar approach" and poked fun at it. Now, of course, we can see Asvan as a watershed; its research design has had many followers. Nonetheless, the project did not realize all its goals. As S. Mitchell observes in his riveting ac- count of the project, the vast amount of data generated has never been fully studied. A retrenchment was thus in order during the subsequent excavations at Tille, where recovery of first-millennium B.C. architecture was made a prime goal. In contrast, the current (atal H6oyuk project is following the lead of the Asvan pioneers in its huge ambitions for an interdisciplinary understanding of the environment, but now freed from time constraints and, it seems, from any budgetary worries. Finally, BIAA researchers have been active in explor- ing the lesser-known byways of Anatolia during the Ro- man and Byzantine periods. The record here is rich. In 1957 the BIAA published W.M. Calder and G. Bean's Clas- sical Atlas of Asia Minor (Ankara 1957), an outgrowth of a longstanding British interest in Classical epigraphy, and Byzantinist Michael Gough was already active in the south and southeast. D. French would later comb the country for traces of Roman roads. Several of these projects are presented in this volume, with references to additional work. In the southwest, clas- sical antiquity has been the focus in two major surveys, one at Oinoanda and Balboura, the other in Pisidia. The Ro- mans specifically have also been pursued at the other end of the country, on their eastern frontier. Byzantine and Medieval research reported here includes discussions of Gough's findings at Alahan and Dag Pazan in the Taurus Mountains and at Eski Gumui; of excavations at Amorium; and of surveys of castles in the Maeander region and at Kutahya and Nicomedia. Striking has been the British in- terest in Black Sea and Thracian Turkey. This volume gives us only a taste of the considerable BIAA research in these regions, with D. Winfield on the wall paintings at the Hagia Sophia, Trabzon, and S. Hill on his rescue excava- tions of a church at Ciftlik, near Sinop. This book, attractively printed and including a gener- ous selection of color photographs, whets our appetites for more. We look forward to an equally productive sec- ond half century for the BIAA. In the meantime, the book makes a major contribution to the history of archae- ology in Turkey, taking its place beside such recent retro- spectives asJ.-L.

Cook and R V Nicholls. (BSA Suppl. 30.) Pp. xxviii + 248, figs. 42, table 1, pls. 30, foldout pls. 4. The British School at Athens, Lon- don 1998. ?50. ISBN 0-904887-28-6 (cloth). Between 1948 and 1951, Anglo-Turkish excavations under the direction of J.M. Cook and Ekrem Akurgal brought to light the tantalizing remains of an important early sanctuary of Athena next to the North-East Gate of Old Smyrna (Bayrakll). Soon after the conclusion of these excavations, specialized studies on the city walls and the finds from the site were published by members of the British excavation team in articles in the BSA (1958- 1959, 1964, 1965, and 1974). At that time, too, articles were prepared byJ.M. Cook on the stratigraphy of the sanctuary and by R.V. Nicholls on the architectural phases of the temple of Athena and the other structures associated with it. For reasons that are not altogether clear, the publication of the latter two studies was deferred until the appearance of Akurgal's Alt-Smyrna I, Wohnschichten und Athenatempel (Ankara 1983). After further delays and the death ofJ.M. Cook, the two studies were finally published in 1998 in the volume under review. Reflecting its origin in two separate articles, the vol- ume is divided into two parts, each independently au- thored. This division is by far the most bothersome aspect of the publication. Because Cook's discussion of the ex- cavations and stratigraphy precedes Nicholls's presenta- tion of the architecture, Cook is compelled to anticipate many of Nicholls's architectural observations in order to clarify the significance of the stratigraphy. What is worse, the reader is required to follow the complex phases of the sanctuary twice. A far more economical approach would have been to integrate the stratigraphic evidence from part 1 into the detailed description of the architectural phases in part 2. The stratigraphic discussion of part 1, while it advances clear arguments for the relative and absolute chronology of the major features of the site, is, by current standards, 2000] 801</page></plain_text>
