<plain_text><page sequence="1">IsMEO ACTIVITIES Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici in Asia The archaeological excavations of the Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici in Asia of IsMEO, of which a brief survey is given below, were carried out thanks to the cooperation of and a grant from the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR). Archaeological Mission in Iran Isfahan Masgid-i Gunfa. The Italian Archaeological Mission organized by IsMEO at the invitation of the Service for the Restoration and Preser? vation of the Historical Monuments of Iran returned to Isfahan for the sixth time in the period 1st October-15th December 1975, to con? tinue archaeological research in the Masgid-i Gum'a at Isfahan in collaboration with the Italian Res? toration Mission led by the architect Eugenio Galdieri. The Mission takes great pleasure in thanking most warmly the Director of the Department of the Ministry of Art and Culture at Isfahan, Dr Habib Eshraghi, for his friendly and obliging assistance in facilitating our work. We should also like to thank Mr Besharat, Deputy Adminis? trative Director of the Department, and the architect Mr Bagher Shirazi, the technical super? visor, for their constant and friendly cooperation. The team, led by Prof. Umberto Scerrato of the University of Rome, was composed of the following members: the archaeologists Dr Maria Vittoria Fontana, Dr Bruno Genito and Dr Fran? cesco Noci (site supervisors), Dr Giovanna Ven trone Vassallo (finds assistant and epigraphist) and the architect Dr Ruggero Morichi (topographer). Also taking part in the Mission's work were the anthropologist Prof. Edoardo Pardini of the University of Florence, and the zoologist Dr Bruno Compagnoni; they undertook the study of the human and animal bones discovered. On account of the difficulty in finding work? men, given the boom in industry and building at Isfahan, the archaeological research work did not begin until 20th October. The limited number of workmen, as well as the inclement weather with neavy snowfalls at the beginning of Decem? ber, caused work to proceed at a slow pace, nevertheless with good results. Digging was continued in the north portico, in the courtyard with the opening of some new sectors, and in particular the systematic exploration was begun of the numerous wells with which the excavation area is riddled: up till now about thirty of them have been investigated. We also began investigation in the western half of the "sanctuary", area 190, carrying on the work begun in the eastern half in 1973. The East Iw?n, area 129, was also explored. In the "sanctuary", area 190, after having removed and strengthened the large pavement of alabaster slabs, we reached the Seljuq pavement of large bricks which is reasonably well preserved and which supports the base of a monumental minbar (fig. 3). The exploration of the courtyard gave us no useful evidence for the original mosque, but seems to confirm our impression that in correspondence with the courtyard, even before the construction of the mosque, there was an open space which, if not exactly empty, was certainly not densely built up, but had large areas free of permanent structures. The general archaeological evidence obtained beneath the East Iw?n, area 129, is most inter? esting, even at this early stage, although greatly disturbed (figs. 1, 4-6). In addition to there being exposed the stumps of pillars belonging to the hypostyle mosque, B15-B16, and the 10th-century extension C15-C16, which had already been brought to light by Galdieri (cf. E. Galdieri, Isfahan: Masgid-i Cum a, Pts I and II, Roma, 1972-73) and then covered up again, the remains of a col? lapsed circular pillar were also discovered. These are perhaps the remains of B15 which in antiquity had fallen into a pit, isolated in the centre of the room between the pillars B15-B16 and C15-C16. The pit had broken through the two subsequent floors of the hypostyle mosque. Together with the remains we found a great number of fragments of stucco decorations of the same type and style as those which come both from the north portico (area 404) and from area 190 (cf. ?IsMEO Activities ?, EW, XXIII, 1973, p. 418, figs. 6, 8). A foundation of baked-brick pieces was discovered E of the pillar B15, in part interrupted by the foundations of this pillar (fig. 6). It belongs to an earlier construction with quite a different orientation, and is perhaps connected with a pavement of small baked bricks which has been isolated between the pillars B16 and C16, broken to N by the aforementioned pit and to S interrup? ted by the stone foundations of the Iw?n. It seems to be easy to suppose the presence of a pillared building prior to the hypostyle mosque and it is tempting to hope that we are on the tracks of the original mosque, but we shall prudently await 538</page><page sequence="2">N )ML?H-1-,-j Q5 0 05 1 2m Fig. 1 - Isfahan, Masgid-i Gunra.

Morichi.) 539</page><page sequence="3">the possibility of widening the excavation area and leave the answer to future investigation. The emptying of the wells gave us a series of noteworthy indications (figs. 9-14). In particular, pottery of fine, fairly pure ware, yellowish-green in colour with a thick surface and tiny burnished striations. It belongs for the most part to small, pot-bellied jugs with a flat base or to ovoid jugs with an undecorated flat or disk base (figs. 9, 13), some clearly derived from metal prototypes (fig. 10). This pottery is completely lacking in the Period I levels, i.e. in the levels which we believe to be late Sassanian and of the very first years of the Hegira. This ware probably came into use at Isfahan between the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries, in which period the wells were all systematically filled in and closed. We must note that the pottery from the wells and from all the pre-mosque levels is made up almost exclusively of unglazed ware, with very few exceptions which come from a well containing the fragments of a plate and a bowl of Mesopotamian type white-glazed ware (fig. 12) and the fragments of a jug of green-glazed ware with barbotine decoration (fig. 11). The substantial lack of glazed pottery in all of the pre-mosque levels, not only in the earlier ones which we maintain to be late Sassanian, but also in the proto-Islamic levels, with the aforesaid exceptions, makes us think that the hypostyle mosque of Arab type which can still be appreciated must have reached its present extent no later than the mid 9th century. It is quite possible that it must be recognized as the mosque which, according to Ab? Nuc?ym and al-M?farr?hi, was rebuilt in 226 H./840-841 A.D., during the caliphate of al-Mu"tasim, in place of the old, probably smaller one founded by the Arabs of Tiran in 156 H./772-773 A.D. Upon the completion of our work, having performed the appropriate linking-up operations between the foundations of the pillars, it was decided that a part of the area already explored (fig. 7), i.e. that corresponding to the eastern part of the north portico, should be filled in with sand, in order to facilitate possible investigations in the future. Shahf-i Sokhta The seventh campaign of excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta was carried out under the leadership of Prof. Umberto Scerrato from September 2 to December 1, 1975. The primary aims of the cam? paign were the complete survey of the site with a first outline of its geological history, and the environmental set-up, the extensive stratigraphical testing of the earliest period at the Eastern Residential Area, and the continuation of the excavations at the graveyard. The members of the team were Dr Marcello Piperno, Dr Maurizio Tosi and Dr Sandro Salvatori, field directors; Mr M.A. BayanI and Mr S.M. SajjadI from the Iranian Centre for Archaeological Research; Prof. Giovanni De Marco, geobotanist and palaeoecol ogist; Prof. E. Pardini, physical anthropologist, as? sisted by Mr Ali Sururi Negahb?n from the Univer? sity of Tehran; Dr Bruno Compagnoni, zoologist, assisted by Misses Farideh Meschi and Zar? Asadi from the Department of Environmental Conser? vation. The settlement and its environment. The ground survey of Shahr-i Sokhta carried out by Dr Tosi and Mr Sajj?dl in December, 1974, was completed in the first two weeks of the campaign. It has been established that the site of Shahr-i Sokhta extends over a surface of approximately 151 hectares of which 21.30 should be ascribed to the graveyard, which extends across the total east-west length of the settlement. Both settle? ment and graveyard were sited on top of a Pliocene terrace. The task of the geographer has been to establish the position of this terrace within the general system of terracing established by German geographers five years ago in Afghanistan. As a result it appears that the town developed on top of the Ram R?d terrace, which represents the second stage of rejuvenation for the Hilmand delta and that farming activity was concentrated to the east of the site in an extensive area reached by the terminal branches of the proto-historic deltaic system. This area is characterized, nowadays, by a flat clay plain on which survive boat-shaped, wind-eroded hillocks technically termed yardangs. These represent the remains of the subsequent terracing after Ram R?d and are termed Nimruz. In other words, the settlement of Shahr-i Sokhta was established between the Ram R?d stage and the Nimruz one. In the 3rd millennium B.C. the delta was flowing at the level of the Nimruz yardangs, and to avoid flood erosion or occupation of arable land settlements were primarily estab? lished on top of the surviving Ram R?d flats, which must have risen approximately 7 m. above the flat plain of the time. The combined action of unidirectional winds and a surface per? colating water have eroded the Nimruz terraces, leaving the yardangs as the only remnants. Several very small sites, mostly contemporary with the 3rd-millennium phases at Shahr-i Sokhta have been recovered by sectioning the top of the yardangs. This emphasizes the importance of such a preliminary geological investigation for all future research on settlement pattern and distribution. 540</page><page sequence="4">Erosion was certainly very strong at the time at Shahr-i Sokhta too. Due to the uniformity and strength of the northwestern winds the whole terrace was shaped with a rising surface from west to east. A cross-section was therefore obtained with the help of manual drills, bulldozer trenches, side sections and previous excavations. The natural terrace underlying the anthropic deposits is made of approximately 2 cm. of compact gravel intermixed with sands or sandy clays. A remarkable achievement of the geological survey is the demon? stration that the compact salt crust found all over the site and often responsible for the excellent preservation already existed at the time of the city. Excavations at the graveyard in area HRY have shown that some graves, particularly 501, were excavated within the salt crust and made use of the compact deposit for vaulting the burial shafts. Wind action predominated in the erosion of the western part of the site, whereas water gulleys, mostly southeast oriented, predominated in the Eastern Residential Area. As a result the eastern part of the site rises approximately 8 m. above the rest. A second important reason is due to the nature of the anthropic deposits in this area. It is in fact only on the eastern edge over an area of approximately 15 hectares that we have remains, mostly dwellings of phase 7 (2750-2650 B.C.), which appear to have been destroyed in an extensive fire and left intact. The geobotanical survey has had the task of reconstructing, through the dynamical series of vegetation, the possible plant environment in the 3rd millennium B.C. This method has been previously tested in other parts of the Near East and is based on a strict combination of geological, climatic, and pedological data within the ecology of each plant population. It appears to be ex? tremely successful in arid land, where conditions of growth and population of each plant species fall within a very narrow spectrum. As a result Prof. De Marco has been able to confirm previous hypotheses which would have put Shahr-i Sokhta between a deltaic farming environment to the east and a lacustrine one highly favourable for bird hunting and cattle keeping to the west. This is particularly important to understand the reason for the localization of Shahr-i Sokhta which might have been an economical one, since the site primarily functioned as a coordination and redistri? bution centre of the extensive resources available in Sistan. The importance of cattle in Sistan history can hardly be emphasized too much since all available written records and present evidence refer to it as a major resource and something like a socio-economic land mark for the area. Zoo archaeological research has shown that cattle bones at Shahr-i Sokhta account for slightly over 20% of the total. This would mean that over 50% of the meat eaten by the ancient Shahr-i Sokhta rians came from cattle. The excavations this year in area XDV have shown that cattle bones in the earliest levels of the city are well over 50%, cattle meat representing most of the proteins consumed. All archaeological, geo-morphological, zoological and paleobotanical evidence shows that Shahr-i Sokhta was founded and expanded through most of the 3rd millennium B.C., as the centre for the exploitation of a very broad spectrum of available resources. The exploration of this economic system and its technological level remains the primary task of our research program, due both to the very unusual preservation of the site and to the conditions of isolation, productivity and instability so typical of all the Central Asian land-locked basins, Sistan among them. The explorations of the settlement were carried out in two different excavations. In area XDV XDW a deep test trench was dug into the levels of Period I, phases 8, 9, 10, which were exposed to ground level by surface erosion. A second extensive excavation was opened by Dr S. Salva tori 250 m. to the west of the Eastern Residential Area in a flat area where the analysis of aerial photographs had shown the existence of a very large architectural complex. The trench in XDV XDW measured at its beginning 250 sq. m. whereas at the bottom it was restricted to 40 sq. m. The following points were documented pri? marily (fig. 15): 1 - The settlement was founded in around 3200 B.C. in phase 10, of which we excavated a group of three rooms. The material culture is characterized by painted pottery with characteristic stereometric chessboard patterns of southern Turkmenian tradition, more restricted types of shallow stripe-painted bowls, and a few sherds of trumpet rims of black burnished ware known to be characteristic of Yahya IV C. Certainly the most impressive and noteworthy find within phase 10 was a proto-Elamite tablet found at the northeastern corner of room CCXCIII in the filling 10 cm. above the floor of the room, which represents the earliest structural level found so far at Shahr-i Sokhta. The tablet is plano-convex in section, rectangular in shape and has a line of script composed of two pictograms and a numeral. It is sealed with cylinders on both faces. The find is remarkable not only because it represents the easternmost tablet of any kind found, but also because the related cultural association is very different from what has been found in other known proto-Elamite settlements such as Tepe Yahya, Sialk IV, Maly?n or Godin Tepe. Apart from a few dozen sealings bearing 541</page><page sequence="5">impressions of pictographic cylinder seals the rest of the material culture, primarily the pottery, does not show any of the typical "proto-Elamite" traits such as bevel-rimmed bowls and solid-footed goblets. The pottery remains typically represen? tative of the Geoskjur horizon as known in southern Turkmenia, southwestern Afghanistan, the Quetta Valley and Waziristan as far east as the Indus. What is remarkable then is that the most characteristic feature of the proto-urban stage in the Iranian plateau, proto-Elamite script, comes within a Central Asian, proto-Indian cultural texture. To emphasize furthermore these connec? tions with the East in the earliest levels of Shahr-i Sokhta we must also point out the discovery of three sherds of distinctive polychrome jars identical in decoration, technique and shape to the materials from the Nal cemetery in Jhalawan, southern Pakistani Baluchistan (fig. 17). 2 - The area XDV became after the end of phase 10 an open space and a lane between two blocks of buildings and apparently maintained this function for over 500 years to the end of phase 6 (2500 B.C.). The southern section of the square has shown repetitive cuts in the micro stratified external deposits corresponding to phases 9, 8 and 7. A major building, probably a house, was positioned in the northern section of the square XDV and in most of XDW. This complex dates to both phases 8 and 9 with slight changes in plan. Part of it became an open courtyard where we have the facing of the narrow street no. 1, one of the east-west cardinal communication lines in the Eastern Residential Area. The material culture in phases 9 and 8 underwent some slight but important changes. In the whole of the sequence in fact, we face a steady development towards type articulation and functional special? ization of the pottery vessels. Internal analysis shows these changes were very slight but significant in the space of one or two centuries (fig. 18). 3 - Phase 7 is one of the best preserved in the Eastern Residential Area. Buildings were burned both to the north and to the south of street no. 1. The preservation is due to the fact that most of the destroyed buildings were not levelled to make way for new ones. The whole of the ceiling and the floor of the terrace had sunk into room XCIX, excavated this season. Five roof beams were still intact (fig. 16). The same happened in the northern part of the area where a whole architectural com? plex was burned and left intact. The phase 6 dwellings were set on a side of the destruction hillock, cutting only part of the buildings and leaving all the rest as open spaces. In phase 5 all these areas were covered with artificial pottery fills, which have increased preservation all through the area. Erosion later attacked the phase 4 structures, leaving in some cases just their foundations, which as a rule were built across the phase 5 rooms to increase basal stability of the buildings. 4 - The end of occupation in the Eastern Residential Area occurred much earlier than in the rest of the site. Meanwhile, human occupation in Sistan and at Shahr-i Sokhta seems to have reached its quantitative peak in phases 4 and 3 (2400-2100 B.C.). The Eastern Residential Area was simply used as a cattle corral, as shown this season by test trenches in the surviving top layers across squares XHJ and XHI. Thinly superimposed layers of cattle dung and clay layers occupy extensive areas between the buildings of phase 4. As a result we have evidence that most of our research in the previous campaigns had been chronologically more limited than we thought. In past reports we had emphasized the importance of the settlement in Period II, phases 7-5; mean? while the surface investigation with aerial photo? graphs and Salvatori's work this season point out that the most extensive settlement in the history of human occupation at Shahr-i Sokhta occurred in Period III. The exploration of extensive building localized in the central part of the site was conducted by Dr Salva tori by laying a 50x20 m. trench in the southeastern corner of the building, as delimited on the aerial photograph. Here appeared a regular network of walls. The excavations unfortunately had to be interrupted on October 30 because of a sudden illness of Dr Salva tori, who had to return to Italy. But we can state preliminarily that the regular network of walls corresponded to the foundation system of a square building extending for over 500 sq. m. built in phase 4 and used into phase 3 on top of structures datable to phase 5. Erosion had cut into these structures levelling them practically everywhere to underneath the floor level. Moreover, the system used to set the building was not much different from the one employed in the Eastern Residential Area in phase 6 on the burned structures of phase 7. Erosion had then already shaped the ruins of phase 5 into a mound form, and the new building was stabilized by setting it on the southern side of the erosion mound. As a result, the phase 5 sherds started sliding on top of the later buildings as soon as the erosion had graded them to the same level. We had, therefore, the earlier sherds on top of the more recent buildings. The problem was faced by setting long north-south sections across the buildings and following the distribution of levels and structures by descending just a few centimeters at a time over extensive areas. A second test trench 20 x 10 m. was set across the 542</page><page sequence="6">western wall of this large enclosure seen on the aerial photograph. The area is in square NXU and has shown that the enclosure should probably be dated to phase 5. Quite noteworthy for this trench was the excavation of a series of layers made of daily household waste very rich in perishable organic materials. The whole deposit was sieved and floated, providing a very large collection of wood, seeds and textiles. The graveyard. The third campaign of exca? vations at Shahr-i Sokhta graveyard was carried out between September 10 and November 6, 1975. The choice of the area to open for excavation was partly based on random numbers, established on a 10 x 10 m. grid laid over the presumed area of extension of the graveyard. Its extreme uniformity and size would have made impossible either the choice of preferential areas or the availability of a sizable percentage of the ancient population without sampling. This selection on a random number series has led us to the excavation of areas HRY and HNE respectively to the south and west of the trenches previously excavated. Outside these new areas the earlier excavations were also enlarged, both in squares IPW - INC and in IRX; out of the 66 graves discovered in the course of the campaign 64 have been exca? vated, 7 of which were empty shafts both of simple and bipartite types (fig. 19). The other 57 contained from 1 to a maximum of 8 skeletons. In two cases, HTW 410 and HNE 609 we had an intentional deposition of isolated skulls without directly related post-cranial parts, set according to a ritual still very little documented either in Iran or Central Asia. As previously stated the excavations of this year have clearly indicated that from a stratigraphic point of view some of the deepest graves were cut into the thick layer of salt which covers the total area of the graveyard in a variable thickness. The few graves in the gravel whose shafts are visible in the sections are shown to have been opened a very short distance below the present ground level by sharply cutting the layer of salt and gravel, which is often over 40 cm. thick. In sectors IP &amp; IN we have, properly speaking, two levels of deposition above and below the salt level, often independently of their chronological dating; graves of the earliest phases documented in the area (phases 9,8,7) are sometimes to be found at the same depth of later graves (phases 3,2). The result of the new distribution of the graves seems to indicate that the development of the graveyard took place in successive clusters. These clusters can be localized by some significant concentrations of graves in rather limited areas surrounded by empty spaces. Also, the recurrence of certain pottery types, particularly decorative patterns or specific objects are useful as common denominators for the localization of clusters. This is the case of the so-called group of N?l, a cluster of 6 graves in area IR and visibly isolated from the surrounding burials. They are categorized by the presence in two graves of the typical cylinder jars of N?l. We have a similar concentration in area IW where a new type of bichrome decorated small jars, so far undocumented at Shahr-i Sokhta, appears in three different furnishings, always in association with pottery of phases 5 and 6 (figs. 21, 22). Another recurrent element in the burial ritual at Shahr-i Sokhta seems to have been the sacrifice of a kid, which was generally placed beside the head of the dead (fig. 23). In the six cases of such sacrifices reported this season all are associated with graves of the early phases 7, 8 and 9, but the per? sistence of the ritual in later phases is documented by the excavations of the previous seasons. In the case of grave HTW 410, where the last deposition had been surrounded later by the skulls of the earlier inhumations, a small kid was placed inside a shallow bowl located, possibly as a post-burial ritual, to the south of the repartition wall. The same careful placing of sets of skulls was observed in the grave HNE 609 where 8 skulls were used to make a circle around the careless assemblage of other human bones. The grave had no pottery and cannot be dated. One of the richest graves, HYM 413, could be attributed to phase 10, probably contemporary with the tablet level. In it was an adult between 50 and 55 years of age buried in a catacomb grave with a furnishing of 12 vessels, 9 of pottery, 3 of calcite, 2 spindle whorls and a necklace of calcite beads near the neck (fig. 20). Of particular interest for the reconstruction of lithic technology in the 3rd millennium B.C., as well as for the analysis of the role played by certain categories of craftsmen in the social fabric of Shahr-i Sokhta is grave IWD 77, where a male of 25 years was buried with a whole kit of tools necessary for the working of chalcedony and the production of chlorite stamp seals. Beside a large rectangular smoother made of sandstone we found a convex scraper made out of the first flake of a pebble, several chert cores partially utilized and 8 blocks of chalcedony at different stages of working, the last one being represented by a large bead shaped by flaking over the entire surface but neither smoothed nor drilled. The kit was completed by 5 quartzite drill heads, of which one is totally unutilized, 2 are lacking the bottom for shafting, and 2 are intact but already levigated. If we compare this association with one recovered 543</page><page sequence="7">in grave G12 during the campaign of 1972, which was probably representative of a lapis lazuli cutter, we have direct evidence of the sharp differentiation existing even within the stone cutting of two production processes with totally different tech? nologies. During the month of October the osteological study of the human remains of Shahr-i Sokhta, initiated in the 1973 campaign, continued. A rather high number of skeletons has been brought to light (80) but the poor state of preservation of a great part of them has largely limited the recovery and study of osteological remains. Excluding children, which are not useful for a proper definition of an anthropological group, because of the instability of their somatic characters, the adults useful for metric and morphometrical studies were approxi? mately 20, equally divided between the two sexes. The average age of the adults is rather low; 25-30 years for the males, 20-25 for the females and extremely low for the children, 2-3 years. We observed as recurrent phenomena: 1) cases of exostasis, presumably of arthritic origin on vertebrae especially in the cervix-lumbar section; 2) extreme erosion on the crown of the molar teeth in the transverse oblique direction, the so-called shaboloid direction: this phenomenon can hardly be justified by the age of the subject but seems to indicate that the masticatory apparatus was used also for functions unrelated to the nutritional process; 3) deterioration of the alveolar process due to dental abcess; exostatis from traumatic origin as well as dental caries appear to have been extremely rare. Notwithstanding the restricted number of subjects examined and the variability of the characteristics found, we are giving here a very tentative and preliminary description of the average physical type. Craniotypically the type of indi? vidual can be defined: a) dolicho-meso cranial (long head); b) meso-acro cranial (medium-high head); c) broad or thin zygoma tic arches; d) medium-long face; e) medium-high orbits; /) quite long nose, often also broad (mesoleptinear); g) straight facial profile with cases of prognathism of the alveolar arch; h) the stature is decidedly great in males (above 170 cm.) and proportionately much smaller in the females (158 cm.). The corporal proportions follow preferably the lepto morphic canon with often long forearms and legs. The limited numbers of shapes and characteristics seen, but primarily the lack of statistical elaboration of the data gathered so far, does not allow at the moment any proper anthropological classification of the inhumed bodies of Shahr-i Sokhta within the morphological context of proto-historic populations in Iran and Central Asia. Archaeological Mission in Afghanistan The Italian Archaeological Mission in Afghan? istan carried out its research work in the Ghazni area in September - October 1975. It was composed of the archaeologists Prof. Maurizio Taddei (field director) and Dr Giovanni Verardi, by the exca? vation assistant Mr Manlio Valentini and by the draughtsman Nicola Labianca. The Ministry of Information and Culture of the Republic of Afghanistan sent Mr Fazlur Rahman Mujaddidi and Mr Habibullah Samani, both members of the Afghan Institute of Archaeology, as assistants. The post of foreman and supervisor was covered by Mr Ghulam Naqshband Rajabi. Mission activity consisted of resuming exca? vation work at Tapa Sard?r, which had been interrupted after the 1972 campaign, and of preparing a systematic reconnaissance of the region lying between the upper valley of the Argand?b, the N?wor swampland, the Gagat? of Ghazni and the Gagat? of Wardak. Excavation at Tapa Sard?r The main efforts during this campaign were directed towards clarifying the plan of the complex of structures lying behind the row of chapels lining the south side of the Great St?pa. This objective was not reached in a number of rooms, although the aspect of room 75 is already becoming quite clear: it was square in plan and had a clay image in each corner (fig. 24), as in room 36 (EW, XIX, 1969, p. 545, fig. 9) but was smaller than the latter. Two of the four images remain standing in the north and south corners. The one in the west corner has fallen face downwards and it is hoped that most of it can be recovered. The one in the east corner has yet to be reached by the excavation work. The centre of the complex was apparently the large room 49, with a cross-vaulted roof and surrounded by a corridor providing access to the other rooms, e.g. 36, 41 and 75. Communication between this complex and the row of chapels along the south side of the Great St?pa was ensured by relatively small vaulted passageways leading directly into chapel 74, the last of the row going eastwards. A few trials carried out in the masonry enabled a number of technical characteristics to be ascer? tained, the most significant of which is that very often the lower part of the wall is made of pahs? while bricks are used from the base plane of the vault upwards. 544</page><page sequence="8">The use of bricks of varying sizes, as discovered in the above trials, must be thoroughly investigated. For the time being, the most precise data have come from an examination of the block of masonry delimiting chapel 74 to the east (fig. 25). In it, a succession of three different types of masonry can be observed: 1) 42x42 cm. bricks with greenish-white plaster; 2) 47 x 47 (46 x 46) cm. bricks with ordinary-clay plaster; 3) 40 x 40 (38x38) cm. bricks with frequent half-bricks (40 x 19 cm.); in all cases the thickness was around 10 cm. The wall built using 40x40 cm. bricks, which incorporates the first two, is related to the construction of the row of chapels. In the course of the campaign a small dig made in 1961 in the south part of the tepe by Prof. S.M. Puglisi, was resumed and widened. Although it is still only the size of a trial trench, it has provided one important result already. It has made it possible to establish that the area itself in the more recent period extended as far as this southern spur of the hill. Architecturally speaking, the most significant monument in the area for the moment is st?pa 81. It was built using a similar technique to the one employed for building 65 (EW, XXII, 1972, pp. 382-83) and for the upper portion of the Great St?pa. It stands on a partially paved floor that is linked also to wall 88 running parallel to the st?pa on the east side, which was probably the base of a row of chapels. Immediately to the west of 81 and more recent, although only slightly, than it (the end walls are built on schist paving) two chapels (nos. 87 and 89) open. They are contiguous and rectangular in shape. They have not yet been completely excavated and are joined by a corridor (no. 96). Of particular interest is room 87 on the floor of which stands an altar built of unbaked clay. It is octagonal in shape, has concave sides and does not appear to have any typological precedents (fig. 27). With the resumption of construction work in the sanctuary in the 7th-8th centuries, the earlier and now destroyed sacred area was filled in with courses of bricks and pahs? in the form of a kind of terrace-work while a few of the ancient stone structures were used as foundations for the new buildings constructed on this terrace. Very little now remains of the latter phase. However, still partly preserved are area 95, probably an exterior, and a staircase (no. 90) leading from no. 95 to a room that has been lost. The staircase runs be? tween mud-brick walls typical of the final Tapa Sard?r phase (38x38x10 or 38x19x10 cm.) and is built of large schist slabs. In addition to the pottery, numerous fragments of bronze objects (in some cases definitely belonging to images) have also been found in this part of the excavation together with inscribed clay tablets. The latter had already been documented in the Ghazni area (at G?dul-i ?hangar?n: M. Taddei, in EW, XX, 1970, pp. 70-86) but have only now been found at Tapa Sard?r in a well-defined stratigraphic context. One of the minor objects worth mentioning is the multiple plaster mould (Inv. no. TS. 2000) from which were obtained the applied decorative elements so fully documented in the chapels and votive st?pas on the east and south sides of the Great St?pa (fig. 26). Reconnaissance Surveys In Autumn 1974 a short survey carried out by the Mission in the Woleswali of Qarab?g (Wilayat of Ghazni) led to the discovery of the monastery complex of Homay QaPa (EW, XXIV, 1974, p. 478). Further exploration in 1975 revealed that it was not just an isolated monument but only one example, and not even the most important, of a whole series of rock monuments spread over about 50 km. in the northern part of the Woleswalis of Qarab?g and Gaguri on the southern slopes of the Hindukush. Although it was not possible to visit all the sites that were progressively reported in the course of the journey, the number of monasteries actually seen already reaches a very respectable total. In the Woleswali of Qarab?g, stands the complex of Nai QaTa (fig. 28) together with that of Homay QaPa. The latter is the smaller and lies about 15 km. away to the east. The two monasteries are linked by smaller settlements along the northern side of Mt Debadai. The grottos are often quite large (the largest measures 13x9.50 m.) and are relatively well preserved. The most common type, both here and in the other sites we visited, has a rectangular plan and a parabolic vaulted roof. There is usually a niche in the side walls. An exceptional feature of the Nai Qal'a complex is the presence of a large room with a door in the end wall giving access to a smaller room where the throne of a lost image is still preserved. The plaster work, blackened but still preserved, shows faint traces of colour which suggest the existence of preserved paintings. In the L?man area, at the end of the road from Moqur-Anguri, already inside the Woleswali of Gaguri and right on the road itself, the complexes of Tapa Senaubar and S?h Hw?ga rise only a short distance apart. The first of these, in very poor condition and still inhabited, is one 545</page><page sequence="9">of the most interesting of those discovered so far because of the large grotto (12.80x9.20 m.) still containing four decorative niches supported by pilasters which were once occupied by images. Sah Hw?ga comprises a number of tepes, the largest of which still has a few partly filled-in grottos (fig. 29), and mud-brick structures, the upper part of which is distinguished by a passage? way built of pahs? and having a mud-brick vault giving access through two doors to rooms that are now buried. Continuing along the road to Gaguri, this time turning right at the Sang-e Masa bazaar junction one quickly arrives at a valley dominated at one end by the Koh-e H?d and opening towards Gaguri. The valley is almost completely covered with caves, the first of which, called Sangdara, displays, in addition to the more customary type of room described above, also a caityagrha which is unfortunately in bad condition, divided into three aisles by two rows of three columns each where the lateral aisles are one metre lower than the central one. The spectacular complexes of S?r and Bayak rise only a few kilometers away. The first of these, an isolated horst that had been exposed to particularly heavy erosion and cave-ins, so that the grottos can now be seen only in cross section, is traversed by a tunnel-stairway running down from the north wall to the south wall. The second still has inaccessible grottos. The last site in the valley is L?l?hil, which consists of a few grottos opening at the foot of a large sandstone horst that has been exploited to a very slight extent. The links suggested in earlier reports between the complex of Homay Qal'a and the grottos of Fil-hana near Jelalabad will. thus have to be reappraised in the light of the new groups discovered: it seems more likely that they are related, in Afghan territory, to the Haibak group and part of the grottos of B?miy?n. A number of objects from various periods have also been purchased from Ghazni antique dealers for display in the Archaeological Museum of Ghazni, now under construction. These include some very important fragments of large food-storage vessels bearing impressed medallions with inscrip? tions in Graeco-Bactrian (the so-called Ephthalite script). The information given by the antique dealer on the origins of these objects led the Mission to resume exploration of the Gagat? of Wardak and to identify the exact site of origin as probably being D?bah Sar, near the village of QaFa ?dina, already reported (under the name of Tabak-sar) by U. Scerrato as being a zone of great archaeological importance (EW, XVII, 1967, pp. 13-15). Archaeological Mission in Pakistan In October-November 1975, in collaboration with the University of Trieste, the Italian Archae? ological Mission of IsMEO resumed its excavations in the protohistoric settlement of Aligr?ma in the Sw?t Valley. The Mission was composed of the field director, Prof. Giorgio Stacul, Dr Sebastiano Tusa, archaeologist, and Mr Mauro Cucarzi, who carries out magnetic survey work on behalf of the Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics of the University of Trieste (Director, Prof. A. Marussi). Excavation was effected in two areas, trench E and trench F, thus enlarging the trenches of the previous year. At the completion of the work the excavation covered a total area of about 30 x 12 m. A number of superimposed building phases and floor layers were unearthed. The most recent, lying almost on the surface, date back to the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. and are mainly characterized by carinated bowls and dishes. The earliest, marked in particular by the presence of black-grey burnished ware and large vases with gritty surface, go back to about 1700 B.C. (See EW, XXIV, 1974, p. 479). Of particular interest in trench E is evidence of a perhaps uninterrupted occupation phase taking in Periods IV and V in the Sw?t Valley. After this the site was abandoned and again reoccupied around the 3rd-2nd century B.C. In trench F there is evidence of occupation in periods V and VI and, then, also here, the most recent occupation phase goes back to around the 3rd-2nd century B.C. On the basis of this evidence and the previous year's excavations, we can say that the protohistoric settlement area was not occupied in one and the same period in its entirety but the settlement was shifted, enlarged or restricted a number of times in the course of its history. In trench F bedrock was reached in a number of places. The bedrock was found to have a strong inclination to the east and several cuts had been made in it in various periods to provide space for the houses and also pits. The structures relating to Period VI are particularly well preserved in this trench. In a few cases, a large number of both small and large vases have been found on the floor (fig. 30). Also this year's excavations have shown that exceptionally large numbers of different types of miniature vases are present in the Period VI layers. In trench E, at least four well-defined building phases assignable to Period V have been recognized. On the basis of pottery typology, this period may be subdivided into three chronological phases. Anthropomorphic terracotta figurines have been 546</page><page sequence="10">found in layers assignable to the middle and late phases of Period V (fig. 32). In late-phase Period V layers also stone slabs with two holes in them have been found, again on the floors (figs. 31, 33, 34). They probably had some cultural-religious function. Some indication for dating the middle phase of Period V is given by the result of the dating analysis carried out by the Physical Research Laboratory of Ahmedabad, India, on a charcoal sample collected in 1974 in layer 5 of trench E. The dating is 1100 ? 230 B.C. or 1340-1370 B.C. with MASCA corrections (PRL ?186: kind communication of Prof. D.P. Agrawal). In Period V and VI layers, large numbers of animal bone fragments have been found which are presumably the remains of meals and are currently being identified. On the floor of a room in trench E from the middle phase of Period V the skeleton of a horse was found in full anatomical connection. * * -k In the course of the months of October and November, 1975, Dr D. Faccenna, Director of the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Orientale, Rome, and of the Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici in Asia of IsMEO, visited the sites of the excavation works carried out by the Italian Missions in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. This visit was made with the aim of examining, together with the members of each Mission, the scientific, technical and organizational problems connected with the works, and the coordination of their conduct. On the 12th December 1974, at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Trieste, at the invitation of the Centro di antichit? alto-adriatiche and other cultural institutions of Trieste, Prof. Maurizio Taddei, of the Istituto Universitario Orientale of Naples, field director of the Italian Archaeological Mission to Afghanistan, delivered a lecture on ? Gandharan art in the light of recent archaeological excavations in Afghanistan?. Members of the Italian Archaeological Missions in Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan attended the Third International Conference of the Association for the Promotion of South Asian Archaeology in Western Europe, held in the premises of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique at Ivry-sur-Seine, Paris, on July 1st to 3rd, 1975 (see EW, XXII, 1972, pp. 389 f.; XXIII, 1973, p. 426). Reports on recent research were read by Dr Maurizio Tosi (B. Compagnoni, C. Costantini, M. Tosi, ? Natural Environment and Economical Re? sources of the Hilmand Civilization in Southern Sistan ?; R. Biscione, ? The Pottery from Bronze Age Sistan and Its Connections with Prehistoric Baluchistan ?) and Dr Grazia M. Bulgarelli (? The Lithic Industry of Shahr-i Sokhta: Analysis of a Pro to-Urban Assemblage ?), who are members of the Mission to Iran. Other contributions concerning the excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta were read by Dr Enrica Fiandra (E. Fiandra, S. Tusa, ? Stamp seals and Functional Analysis of their Sealings at Shahr-i Sokhta II-III (2700-2200 B.C.)?) and P. Amiet (? Seals from Shahr-i Sokhta ?). Dr Gio? vanni Verardi read a report on ?The Buddhist Complex of Homay Qala, Afghanistan?; Prof. Giorgio Stacul lectured on ?The Sequence of Protohistoric Cultures in the Swat Valley, Pakistan ?. It was decided that the next Conference should be held in Italy, in July 1977. Prof. Maurizio Taddei took over the chairmanship of the Executive Committee from Mr J.M. Casal, while Prof. J.E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, Instituut van Zuid-Azia tische Archeologie, University of Amsterdam, agreed to act as the permanent Secretary of the Association. Centro Restauri Restoration Mission in Iran The Italian Restoration Mission of IsMEO continues its activity in Iran, under the director? ship of Prof. Giuseppe Tucci, President of IsMEO and of the Centro Restauri, within the framework of a fruitful and cordial collaboration between the Iranian Government (Ministry of Arts and Culture), the National Organisation for the Preser? vation of Ancient Remains of Iran, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and IsMEO. Prof. Guglielmo De Angelis d'Ossat, engineer and architect, and Prof. Giuseppe Zander, architect, work together in carrying out the Mission's projects. Dr Eugenio Galdieri, architect, is the superintendent responsible for all the work of the Restoration Mission in this country. Perse pot is While routine restoration work continued on the Terrace of Persepolis and on other Achaemenian sites in the Province of F?rs, Iran, under the direction of IsMEO, Dr Ann Britt Tilia and Giuseppe Tilia, director of the work at Persepolis since 1964, were given the opportunity of spending a period of study (September 1974 - June 1975) at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, where they were able to bring to completion a 547</page><page sequence="11">number of publications concerning the restoration work and connected archaeological studies. Studies were also made of material from Greece, Egypt, the Near and Middle East in the Museums of Princeton, Philadelphia, New York, Brooklyn, Baltimore and Washington. In the Metropolitan Museum of New York and in the Freer Gallery they were able to examine the bequeathed material in the Herzfeld Archives. Visits were also made to the Museums of Boston, Cambridge, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Chicago. The publications are: 1. Restoration Work at Persepolis and Other Sites in F?rs 1972-1975. (Restorations made earlier have been published in the IsmeoRepMem, VI, 1968, and XVI, 1972). 2. The Terrace Wall of Persepolis. A study of the ground-plan, elevation and masonry of the terrace wall of Persepolis with an attempt at describing the process of construction. The publication includes also an account of discoveries made recently of several changes in the original project and of later additions to the wall, which have not been observed by scholars earlier. A discussion of possible secondary entrances to the terrace. The publication closes with a discussion on the traditional background for the wall and its masonry with comparative studies of similar walls in Greece, Egypt and the Near East. 3. A Study of the Polychromy of the Bas-reliefs at Persepolis. An accurate recording of all traces of the original colours, which remain on the relief surface to-day, and of traces of design made by means of incised lines no doubt in order to guide the artists, who were in charge of the painting of the bas-reliefs. Attached metal ornaments and inlays with different material, now missing, are also discussed. Comparative studies of colour and design in sculpture, painting and textiles in Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia and southern Russia shed light on the interrelations between Achaemenian art and the arts of the various peoples of the Persian Empire. 4. The Building Activity on the Southwestern Corner of the Terrace of Persepolis in Achae? menian and Post-Achaemenian Times. A presentation of the results of an exploration, made in 1973 and 1974, of the site on the south? western corner of the terrace, the so-called Palace H, where remains of three successive buildings were discovered. A re-composition of a monumental stairway, now completely destroyed, belonging to the second Achaemenian building on the site, a palace begun by Xerxes and completed by Artaxerxes I, from some 250 blocks and fragments, found in various places on the terrace and below the wall. It has been possible to make a fairly accurate recon? struction in scale 1:10 of the stairway facade, 40 m. long, which was decorated with 30 tribute bearing delegations. On these drawings some 80 blocks and fragments have been placed in their exact original position in the relief decoration. The publication includes also a discussion on the identification of the various peoples of the Persian Empire represented on the facade as well as comparative studies of the other tribute-bearers at Persepolis, the throne-bearers and also the peoples listed by Herodotos and mentioned in the Achaemenian inscriptions. A discussion on a singular horn-crowned parapet, which we have been able to reconstruct along the Terrace edge on the southern and western sides of the site of Palace H, and its possible relation to the Achaemenian buildings on this site. Dr Francois Vallat of the French Delegation at Susa has re-examined the much discussed Daiva inscription of Xerxes, and in an Appendix to our publication he points to some epigraphical evidence, which, together with other observations, might prove the existence of a relationship between this text and the site we are discussing. Our exploration of the site of Palace H has also contributed to shed new light on the re-occu? pation of parts of the Terrace of Persepolis in post-Achaemenian times, probably by the so-called Fratad?ra rulers soon after 300 B.C. 5. A Re-examination of the So-called Fratad?ra Temple, North of the Terrace of Persepolis. An exploration of the Fratad?ra Temple, ex? cavated by Herzfeld in 1932, has proved beyond doubt that this building complex, earlier believed to be Seleucid or later, is of Achaemenian date although re-used in Seleucid times and later by the Fratad?ra rulers. This re-use is to be seen in connection with the re-occupation of Persepolis after the destruction by Alexander, noticed on the southwestern corner of the Terrace. 6. A Survey of Achaemenian Sites in the North? western Part of the Marv Dast Plain. Through investigations made in 1973 and 1974 it was possible to locate some thirty Achaemenian sites in this part of the plain. Six of them, situated near River Sivand in the plain to the north and west of Persepolis, seem to have been palatial buildings, and judging from their ground-plans, the material of black and white limestone, the stone-work and the decoration they recall closely the architecture of Pasargadae and can therefore 548</page><page sequence="12">be dated to the time of Cyrus II, or possibly Cambyses II, that is to say they are earlier than the monuments on the Terrace of Persepolis. Isfahan The Italian experts of the Restoration Mission of IsMEO continued to work in 1975 in their capacity of technical advisors. The form of collaboration which had already been experimented in the previous three years was continued, that is to say, with greater responsibility gradually being given to local technicians. As in past years, the activity of the Restoration Mission at Isfahan has been concerned with the following monuments: C?1I Q?p?, Cihil Sut?n, Hast Bihist, the Royal Square and Portal of the Qais?riya Bazaar, the Masgid-i 6um"a, the Mauso? leum of Pir-i Bakr?n at Ling?n, the Masgid-i Gumca at Bersi?n. In the last three monuments the Italian experts reserve full responsibility and autonomy, given the particular complexity of the operations and the necessity for thorough prepa? ratory studies. The Italian technical staff at Isfahan in 1975 was composed of the following persons: the architects Dr Eugenio Galdieri (co-ordinator of the whole restoration programme) and Dr Roberto Orazi (director of restoration work); Profs. Ernst J. Grube and Eleanor Sims, in charge of a historical, stylistic and iconographic study of the Safavid mural paintings; Prof. Raimondo Boenni (head restorer, at present responsible for the wall painting sector and advisor on the same kind of works at Shiraz and Nayin); Dr Rosario Paone, architect (in charge of preparatory studies and restoration works concerning the monuments at Ling?n and Bersi?n); Mr Orfeo Trezza, field assistant; Dr Giuseppe Berucci, Dr Franca Fedeli Bernardini, Dr Mario Lolli-Ghetti, architects, who spent from 4 to 6 months with the Restoration Mission of IsMEO, collaborating on a topographical and architectural survey of the Portal of the Qais?riya Bazaar and a little village near Ling?n. c?lt Q?p? (17th century). In the palace atrium of C?H Q?p?, 1975 was devoted to the continuation of the delicate task of strengthening the wooden columns of the t?l?r which faces on to the Royal Square. During the year, two columns ? nos. 6 and 10 ? were completely reinforced (fig. 35). The construction of the wooden gratings, similar in design to the original ones, was continued. Pictorial restoration continued, especially on the top and t?l?r floors, with special attention being paid to the muqarnas. The whole top floor ? partially closed until March 1975 as it was being used as a work-room ? is now open to visitors. Cihil Sut?n (17th century). In the architec? tural field, the repairs and reconstruction of the wooden balconies in the north and south t?l?r continued, as well as the work of checking and reinforcing the stone slabs of the socle all around the monument (fig. 36). The construction and replacement of the new wooden gratings, similar in design to the original ones according to early photographic records, continued in the Great Central Hall and in the south wing. For the new gratings special dark security glass is being used. In the field of pictorial restoration, work has been carried out on rooms P3 and SI and on the second-floor rooms. The unforeseen rise in the cost of materials and labour led to the depletion of available funds and work was consequently stopped in October 1975. Hah Bihih (17th century). During 1975 work was concentrated on reinforcing the vaulted structures on the second floor and on the architec? tural restoration of the S and SE rooms. Work continued on the reconstruction of the wooden cornice crowning the upper part of the building, as well as on the reconstruction of the wooden balustrades. The stone paving on the outside has been almost completely finished. In the pictorial field, the four octagonal rooms on the ground floor were completely restored and work was begun on restoring the rooms to the south. Also completed was the structural, architectural and pictorial restoration of the stairway to the SE which had been partially demolished over the past 50 years. The reconstruction of the wooden capitals has been suspended until it is possible to study the 80-year-old photographs recently pur? chased by the Ministry of Art and Culture. Also on this site work was stopped at the end of October (fig. 37). Mayd?n-i Sah and Qais?riya Bazaar (17th century). As has already been said, the task of proceeding with the restoration of this important complex has been wholly entrusted to the tech? nicians of the local staff of the National Organis? ation for the Preservation of Ancient Remains of Iran, in accordance with the restoration project presented by IsMEO and approved in 1969. The job of freeing and re-opening the internal passageway of the Bazaar around the Royal Square continued throughout 1975. Topographic surveys were carried out in the zone of the coppersmiths (b?z?r meskara) in accord? ance with the 1969 plan. 549</page><page sequence="13">Extensive evidence was found of an ancient arcade running perpendicular to the square. In June 1975 work was resumed on the pictorial restoration of the portal of the Bazaar under the direction of Prof. Boenni. The three reception rooms on the second floor and two of the side loggias opening onto the square were freed of the layer of white plaster previously covering them (fig. 38). Most of the original decoration, of excellent workmanship and in relatively good condition, was laid bare and restored. The entire complex consisting of the portal and the nearby Royal Caravanserai was subjected to a thorough survey and analysis of their original functions and interdependence by the three Italian architects, G. Berucci, F. Fedeli Bernardini and M. Lolli-Ghetti. Masgid-i Gum"a (9th-18th centuries). During 1975 a considerable amount of investigation and reinforcement work was done. Reinforcement of the vaults continued in the SE and SW sectors. A total of 18 vaults were reinforced in 1975. The static restoration of the south gallery of the East Iw?n was only completed in November (fig. 39). Work had been suspended from December 1974 until May 1975 owing to the climatic con? ditions. Important surveys were made of the East and West Iw?ns while restoration work was begun on the walls of the east side of the South Iw?n. Restoration work was also completed on the architectural volumes of the dome of Niz?m al-Mulk and of the three stone staircases discovered inside the perimeter walls of the building. Techni? cal assistance continued to be given to the archae? ological surveys still in progress. Pir-i Bakr?n at Ling?n (14th century). During 1975 work continued on cleaning and fixing the decorative stucco-work. The static and surface restoration of the oldest room, made of unfired mud-brick, was begun and virtually finished completely. Work was begun on reinforcing the muqarnas and stuccos of the barrel vault. In the access passageways, restoration work was begun on both the stucco niches belonging to the ancient fagade and on the original floor. During cleaning and checking operations on the tomb of the Pir, an ancient Moghul deco? ration, consisting of a monumental inscription carved in a special soft stone was discovered under a layer of re-used k?st (fig. 40). Investigation of the historical events concerning the monument con? tinued during 1975 under the direction of Dr R. Paone, for the purpose, among other things, of identifying part of the decorative ceramic material removed in the recent past and transferred to museums and private collections. Masgid-i Gum"a at Bersi?n (12th-17th centuries). Restoration work was resumed after some delay (June 1975). The following six months were devoted, at least as far as the architectural work was concerned, to isolating the remains of the Safavid additions and to their restoration and consolidation. In particular, reinforcement was carried out all round the areas where the brick revetment had been applied to a core of unfired brick. The ancient floor of the courtyard, consisting of large octagonal terracotta tiles, was protected with a layer of k?hgel and sand. As regards surface work, all the plaster and stucco decorative remains inside the domed building were fixed, particularly in the mihr?b area. Also on the outside, reinforcement work was carried out on the remains of several arched structures in bad static condition (fig. 41). Sistan In October 1975 the Italian Mission for the Restoration and Preservation of the Monuments of Sist?n began operations on the sacred building QN3 in the archaeological area at Dahan-i Ghulaman, thus putting into practice the project agreed upon together with the Iranian Organization for the Restoration of the Monuments of Sist?n for the four historic sites of Qafa-i Sam, Kuh-i Khwaga, Shahr-i Sokhta and Dahan-i Ghulaman. The Mission, led by the architect Dr Luca Mariani, was composed of the following persons: the architect Dr Eugenio Baldari, topographer and surveyor, Dr Bruno Genito, archaeologist, Dr Lo? renzo Costantini, microbiologist and palaeobotanist, Dr Bruno Compagnoni, palaeontologist, Mr Vin cenzo Regoli, restorer and Mr Gabriele Graziani, restoration assistant. The Mission also availed itself of the considerable help, both theoretical and practical, of Prof. Gianni de Marco, ecologist and geologist, and of the archaeological mission of IsMEO. Prof. Umberto Scerrato, who is in charge of the archaeological excavations in Iran, and Dr Domenico Faccenna, Director of the Centro Studi e Scavi of IsMEO, also gave their authoritative contribution when they visited the restoration works in November. The mission, which lasted three months, is conceived as the first part of the preservation project, i.e. in carrying out the restoration work of immediate necessity and in studying fully the techniques of protecting mud-brick structures. Consequently, on the basis of experience gained from trying out various mixtures of k?hgel plaster on recently built walls, constructed for that purpose, the trials were extended to twelve pillars and various wall structures in the NW area (the part not covered by a sand dune) of the sacred 550</page><page sequence="14">building QN3. The more ruined of the wall structures were first integrated using modern mud bricks (fig. 43) which, on account of their dimensions and quality, provide a solution in the following functions: 1) aggregative elasticity and consequent greater possibility of filling in the missing ancient parts; 2) clear distinction between the ancient structures and the modern restoration; 3) uniformity of ancient and modern build? ing materials both in their physical-chemical com? position and in construction technique. Subsequently twelve different types of k?hgel plaster were applied to the pillars only, the idea being to work on isolated elements which could be easily controlled and to obtain a uniform aspect inside the building where solutions of continuity were lacking. The k?hgel was prepared and applied according to local techniques, and the aim is to find out which type of operation gives the most complete, valid and lasting protection (fig. 44). In the period October-December 1975 we thought it appropriate to make some trial-trenches in the area immediately west of and adjoining QN3, an area which it was decided to include in the protective operations on the aforementioned building. These trials were shown to be necessary in order to try out some restoration techniques already used on QN3. This area, including the private dwelling QN4, where soundings had already been made previously, in 1962-66, will enable us to control the possible differences in holding capacity of the diverse materials on the structures brought to light in various periods. The preservation operations were chiefly directed towards covering the structures with simple k?hgel and, in places which are more exposed to the wind, with k?hgel mixed with luh, a fibre obtained Fig. 2 - Dahan-i Ghulaman (Sist?n, Iran). The private dwelling QN4. Scale 1:200 (drawing by E. Baldari). 551</page><page sequence="15">from the flowers of a typhacea. The solutions adopted can be controlled, however, only after a lapse of some time when the materials used have hardened and adhered perfectly to the structures underneath. Two rooms of QN4 had been brought to light, one of them, probably the more important, with a quadrangular pillar c. 0.90 m. square in the middle (fig. 45). This detail had already been recognized as the main typological feature of the private dwellings at the site, e.g. in QN6 and QN7. The whole area of the dwelling excavated is a rectangle 15.60 m. X 22.20 m. (fig. 2). During the mission the plotting of the general plan of the locality was completed, including the new structures distinguished by the saline outcrops on the sandy crust. The aim was a more complete understanding of the extent of the urban layout and its relationship with the environment. The exploration of the other historical sites of QaFa-i Sam, Kuh-i Khwaga and Shahr-i Sokhta has enabled us to document the state of deterio? ration of the structures in order to understand fully this process, to verify which are the more urgently required operations of protection and restoration and to investigate new outcrops and discoveries owing to the natural deterioration of the architecture. In this connection part of a fresco was detached by Mr V. Regoli from the wall of the entrance vestibule in the palace at Kuh-i Khwaga. The fresco was brought to light when last year's rains caused the collapse of a section of the wall which had been built up against it at a later date (fig. 46). An extensive survey was also carried out by palaeobotanists, ecologists and geologists in the historical sites under investigation in order to examine the possibilities of an environmental restoration of the surroundings of the monu? ment to 1) reconstitute the location of the monument and the complex in antiquity 2) contribute to the ecological improvement of part of the region 3) facilitate the understanding and the protec? tion of the monumental complex and make it easier to visit 4) to check, as far as possible, the process by which the sand dunes, under the force of the NW wind, are gradually covering the area, possibly by creating a natural barrier (by means of vegetation) to contain the dunes. A complete photographic, graphic and descrip? tive documentation of these operations has been compiled, giving the basic principles followed in the restoration, justifying the position taken at the moment of intervention, stating the problems which were faced and solved, and in particular devoting a great deal of space to the conclusions drawn from the experiments conducted so that whoever is to deal with these problems in the future may gain from the research carried out this year in the aforesaid localities. Restoration Mission in Afghanistan IsMEO is finalizing the agreements concerning the Archaeological Museum in Ghazni. Meanwhile the surveys and operational programmes for the restoration of the Ziy?rat of Muhammad Sarif Han (see EW, XXIV, 1974, p. 483) and of the two minarets of Sultan Masc?d and Bahram Sah in the same town are being completed. In October, Dr Roberto Orazi and Dr Eugenio Galdieri, architects, went to Kabul to meet the representatives of the Afghan Ministry of Infor? mation and Culture, the Director General of Archaeology and the Preservation of Monuments and the Director General of Museums, as well as to define the operational details in view of the construction of the Archaeological Museum at Ghazni. The first purchase of materials, especially iron bars for reinforced concrete structures have been sent to Ghazni. In accotdance with the operational programme approved on this occasion, the construction of the first six units of the new museum should be carried out in the next spring. Restoration Mission in Oman At the end of 1974 an agreement was signed between the Sultanate of Oman and IsMEO for a survey and the restoration of the Palace of Bilarab Sultan at Jabrin (17th century) (fig. 42).
