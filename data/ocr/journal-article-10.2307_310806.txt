<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD AND MAN IN PINDAR'S FIRST AND THIRD OLYMPIAN ODES BY CHARLES PAUL SEGAL P INDAR'S First and Third Olympian Odes were composed in honor of victories won by the two Sicilian dynasts, Hieron and Theron, probably in the same year, 476.1 The myths of both odes relate early events concerning the Olympian festival, the founding itself in 0.3, and the contest between Pelops and Oenomaus in O.1, the mythical prototype of the celebrated races in which the nobility of the Hellenic world so avidly participated. The two poems are explicitly linked, moreover, by a direct quotation at the end of Olympian 3 (42) from the famous begin- ning of Olympian I.2 Although the borrowing does indicate that Pindar had in his mind the but recently composed Olympian I when he wrote Olympian 3, it is hardly a necessary conclusion that he wished the two poems to be considered together. So taken, nevertheless, the two poems illuminate one another, reflecting two complementary attitudes toward the nature of heroic action and the basic problem which the odes con- tinually redefine and explore: the relationship between the human and the divine,3 between man's acceptance of his mortality and his aspira- tions for immortality, between his acquiescent receptiveness of the world and his active self-assertion in it. This essay will be devoted to elucidating the significance of the myths and the structure of both odes. The Third Olympian, though rather neglected, foreshadows certain themes and attitudes which become important in subsequent poems; and it is hoped that its significance will emerge more fully from com- parison with Olympian I. The expansive richness of the Third Olympian and the concentrated tension of the First reflect Pindar's whole and balanced sensitivity to the ambiguities of man's position in the world, between life and death, in an environment both fostering and destruc- tive.4 The Third Olympian can be seen as anticipating the free confi- dence in life and the enjoyment of an opening world which appear in brilliant, sensuous odes like 0.6 or P.4. In quieter, more somber works like N. Io, N.8, or 1.7, the other side, represented in part by 0.1, re- asserts itself in a deeper fusion, though perhaps never a full resolution, of joy and pain, life and death.</page><page sequence="2">212 Charles Paul Segal I Olympian I is a poem of superlatives. Beginning with the elemental substances of water, gold, fire, and the blinding sun in an empty sky (6), it ends with the insuperable good fortune of Hieron (Io4ff; 113-14: "The extreme achievement is raised to a peak for kings. Look no longer beyond.")5 and with Pindar's own wish to be "pre-eminent in poetic skill (sophia) everywhere among the Hellenes" (i i6). In this atmosphere of unmitigated superlatives the divine6 enters the human world sud- denly and violently, obeying its own impulses, as incomprehensible to men as the eternal essence of water or gold; as unyielding, overpower- ing, and oblivious to mortal weakness as the dazzling sun. Like the sun -and water and gold, too-however, it is not deliberately cruel or hostile to man, but is the radiant source of his highest happiness as well as a potential destroyer of his existence. This balance is reflected in the two verbally parallel formulations, one positive, one negative, about man and God in lines 54 and 64 respectively: "But if the watchers of Olympus honored any mortal man (Ed c' &amp;j rtv' vSpa Ovarcv 'OAXv`- lTrov aKOTOL  rtuaCav), this was Tantalus" and "But if any man hopes to escape the notice of God in doing anything, he is mistaken" (el 8 OE8v a&amp;vp 7TS K-A.). Tantalus, of course, is the perfect example of the man who cannot "digest" his exceptional good fortune and destroys himself through his folly (ate, 54ff), debasing the purity of the divine gift by his mean and banal use of it. The moral task of the hero, Pelops, sent back to the "swift-doomed race of men " (66) but still radiant with his youthful beauty and the re- collection of his past contact with the gods (67-78), is to accept the power (kratos, 78) and glory (tima, kleos) which the gods bestow, and without demeaning their divinity, to keep them within the limits of his mortality. He must be able to seek actively and to undertake the "danger" (kindynos, 81) of the heroic deed,7 but to recognize that the final achievement and fulfillment (praxis) rest with the god (rVb SErrpa9tv ~iAav 818ot, 85). He must know that his immortalizing deed stems from the very roots of his mortality (82-85). The hero's action and attainment thus do not flow spontaneously from his youthful bloom or divine lineage, indispensable though they may be to his ultimate success: they result also from his acceptance of and struggle with the fact of his death and from the inward power of soul that enables him to call up, out of hope and despair, "alone, in the dark, by the hoary sea" to the god who loved him once. It is from this tension between the awareness of mortality and the recognition of divine power that the heroic act arises.</page><page sequence="3">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 213 The significance of Pelops in the ode depends precisely on this inter- play of the intensity of his humanity, his full sense of death, and the almost desperate strength of his aspirations for a quasi-divine, lasting achievement. The greatness of the First Olympian thus lies (at least in part) in Pindar's refusal to mitigate either of the two forces in tension and yet, without mitigating the unyielding purity, the terrible force, of the divine, to allow it to reach and expand the world of humanity. Poseidon enters this world violently, the " god of the glittering trident " (Aglaotri- aina), "conquered in his wits by desire" (Sat'v-`cEa OpE"VaS ~~'pp), snatching up (&amp;p7r`oat) Pelops and carrying him on golden horses to Olympus (40-42). His appearance is a sudden invasion of the ordered banquet (7- v E lvott-w-arov pavov) set by Tantalus; yet far from being immoral or unjust, this deed of love is sanctioned by Ganymede's com- ing to Zeus for the same purpose (Wii-VIr' '' Xp sO, 45). This sudden and violent yielding to passion is the way the divine acts and comes to men; this very eros represents the possibility of an immediate connection with the divine - though a connection beyond the control of man - through the bloom of beauty with its stirring power, such as Pelops' (67-68).8 At the end of the Tenth Olympian, too, the only other passage in the Epinikia where Pindar alludes to Ganymede, his beauty, through its power to attract the gods, "warded off... shameless death with (the aid of) the Cyprian-born goddess" (O.Io.Io5). This erotic violence, therefore, is not simply negative; and it can later be called upon to radiate back into the established and lasting institu- tions of men the glory and light which it brought them so suddenly.9 Thus the early love of Poseidon for Pelops brings to the hero a more lasting fulfillment in his marriage (gamos, 69, 80) and the continuation of his name in six heroic sons (89). The disturbance of the purely human order of "the most lawful banquet" (37ff) is compensated for in a higher form by the establishment of Pelops at the center of a divinely sanc- tioned rite; and hence the ritual term haimakouriai (90o) emphasizes the divine nature of the institution of which he is made the center.10 The brilliance (aglaia) of the god's trident in snatching up Pelops to Olym- pus (40) is the source of the "brilliant (aglaai) sacrifices" in which he partakes forever in the established rite of the Olympic games (9o-9I).11 Even the golden horses with which Poseidon carried off Pelops (4i) lend their radiance to his victory when the god, in answer to his request, gives him "a golden chariot and horses tireless with wings" (87).12 This divine aglaia and gold, once embodied in the lasting order of the ritual contest and festival, can then even be bestowed by the poet on the</page><page sequence="4">2I4 Charles Paul Segal contemporary victor (&amp;yA(at'ETar R Ka(l LovcrLKaS EV &amp;J-7rp, of Hieron, 14). Pelops, the hero and the victor, has known how to express his aspirations toward the divine with reverence, respecting the sacredness and privacy of his bond with Poseidon and feeling in his request the unapproachable, almost sinister force of the god, "the heavy-rumbling god of the strong trident" (flap;KTrvrrov E3-platwav, 72-73).13 The som- ber isolation of the setting in which he seeks the divine gift is perhaps deliberately antithetical to Tantalus' profane distribution of the nectar and ambrosia to his drinking companions (6off). Tantalus has squan- dered what was given abundantly and voluntarily; Pelops has had to seek in solitude and despair, with a full and poignant sense of the worth of what he is seeking. The risk, the kindynos, of which Pelops speaks in his prayer to Posei- don (81) is twofold: it includes not only the possible suddenness of death at the hands of Oenomaus (76-81), but also the total emptiness and futility of life, nameless, in the dark, "shareless in all beautiful things" when death comes finally in old age (82-84). The young hero, in the aloneness of his prayer, confronts simultaneously "danger" and "necessity," the possibility of failure and the mortal certitude of death. His solitude and darkness are the more poignant for the contrast with the brightness of the gods pervading the poem and his own youthful beauty (67-69). The success, in turn, of his heroic struggle with death, the fame of his victory which "shines from afar" (94), gains greater radiance by contrast with the darkness from which it emerged.14 It has been suggested that Pelops' passage through this dark isolation is like an initiation ceremony, especially with the false death of the hero, his disappearance (see a/cavr0s, 46) in the evil tale of the envious (46-5 I) and the final marriage and quasi-immortality of fame and worship.15 Be this as it may, an important pattern of loss and recovery appears in the alternation in the ode between darkness and light, isolation and festiv- ity. There is a movement from the brightness of the sun and the gods to the darkness of Pelops' prayer (Ev 6p 5va, 71; Ev 'TKdTCp, 83) back to the tempered, humanly receivable brightness of the hero (91, 93-94). There is a corresponding alternation of isolation and crowded festivity: the remoteness of the dazzling sun, alone because of its unapproachable light (6); the banquet of Tantalus (38); Pelops snatched into the divine world, alone (40); the meaner festivities of Tantalus when he profanes the divine gifts among his drinking companions (sympotai, 61); the determined isolation of Pelops in prayer (71); the thronging crowds at the aroAvE'VjraTro3s flwds' at the festival of Olympia (93); and finally back to the isolation of superlative achievement (i I3-14)-</page><page sequence="5">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes z 5 The images of light and of solitude both carry a strong negative, sinister burden which the hero must face. Tantalus' misplaced festivity, his misuse of divine nectar and ambrosia for human feasting, in contrast to his previous "most lawful banquet" (37), results in his enforced separation, "wandering far from joyfulness of mind" (E13poorvvac &amp;AiraL, 58). The antithesis of the brightness of the sun is the lonely darkness of old age (83). Even the youthful beauty of Pelops is shadowed by a grim suggestion of mortality in the phrase "when the down dark- ened his black chin" (pdtAav y7E'ELov ipEov, 68). The communication with the gods at banquets has sinister connotations, too, in the cannibal- istic associations of the Pelops myth (46ff and the hint at the legend of Demeter devouring Pelops' shoulder, 26-27),16 in Pelops' being snatched from a banquet (40), in the use of the verb "digest" (KaTa- 7r4'acL, 55) for Tantalus' folly and the perhaps similar /io0 (83) for the futility of old age. This ambiguity in the imagery reflects the ambiguity of the hero's position between divinity and humanity. He lives in a world which he must grasp fully, knowing the risks involved and ready to endure the destructive implications of meeting the divine."7 The acceptance of this position is difficult and painful. It leads Pelops to hazard the delicacy of his newly blooming beauty (66-69) against the harsh bronze and ruthless terms of Oenomaus that have already killed thirteen men (76-81). The rite de passage from nubile youth to adult man, from mortal to hero, requires a test of courage, not only on the field of battle or racing course, but in the dark solitude of mortality facing divinity (7Iff), of old age staring at death (82ff). The thirteen dead suitors (79-80) represent a threat parallel to the futility of old age (82-84); theirs was a striving which, though active, resulted in a failure as empty as the passivity of age. They are a reminder of the grimness of failure through action, as Pelops' sudden vision of the old man is the image of failure through inaction. Pelops accepts both risks simultane- ously. The anagke of 82 is thus doubly pressing. In either case his rich youth would be consumed in oblivion, for even the suitors, though they strove, are unnamed, only a number (and an unlucky one at that),18 their lurking presence at Olympia dimly felt even in later antiquity in the high mound sacred to them nearby, at which Pelops is said to have sacrificed each year to their shades (Pausanias 6.21.9-I I).19 Yet Pelops' success is in part indicative of the essential benevolence and moral validity of the divine order. Pindar has recast the myth so as to transform the sinister elements, originally associated in part with the gods, into the darker aspects of human mortality itself; and in so doing he has also transfigured the gods. Pelops' "rebirth" from the darkness</page><page sequence="6">216 Charles Paul Segal and solitude of prayer (71) and from his contemplation of the empty darkness of old age (82-84) into the aglaia of his worship at Olympia (91) is the human equivalent and fulfillment of his earlier, mysterious rebirth from the "pure caldron" (26-27). In both cases, nevertheless, the "re- birth" is attended by the love of Poseidon (Epdcaaacro, 25; h01Ata opa Kvirrpies, 75). In the Clotho passage, however, it is a rebirth from the sinister divine forces lurking in the mythical background, the cannibal- istic legend which Pindar hastily refutes, though deliberately pointing back to it in the motif of the caldron.20 In this rebirth, the gods too are " reborn" as the fostering source of the grace which illuminates human life. And it is the possibility of their benevolence and "love" (eros) for man - anthropomorphic and physical though this latter is - which permits their transformation from destructive to restorative. In the second, figurative "rebirth" (71-100), man is struggling no longer against the dim mystery of hostile and cruel divinities, but against the opaque limitations of his own nature. The first "rebirth" is necessary for and makes possible the second, for in the first passage the gods are transfigured, as they must be, from malevolence to benevo- lence, and it is only through their radiant aid that man can overcome the darkness which surrounds and constrains his mortality. The "purity" (katharos) of the caldron in 27, therefore, points ahead not only to Pelops' attainment (and perhaps to its "moral" basis in his prayer and attitude), but also the "purity" of the gods (see P.3.15) which makes it possible. The first rebirth is of significance for the nature of God, the second for that of man. In the first rebirth, ministered by Clotho (26), and in the first part of the poem generally, man is almost entirely pass- ive; in the second, adult and alone, he acts fully and has learned to act not, as Tantalus did, independently of and in opposition to the intent of the gods, but in harmony with them, knowing the point at which he must call upon divine aid through the eros which once illuminated his life (25-27, 40-45). The relationship between divine and human in the central, mythical portion of the poem (25-99) progresses in three main stages, closely interwoven but still clearly discernible. The first (25-51) is the un- troubled favor of the gods for men. Here the gods are freed of the evil charges of cannibalism, though these still remain in the background. Here men receive the divine benefits out of pure beneficence and grace, without exertion; they are close to the gods without having had to win that closeness as Pelops is to do in the third stage. Yet the benefits they receive, lacking the moral foundation of choice and effort, are unstable, impermanent, and soon to be lost by mortal folly (ate). The second</page><page sequence="7">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 217 stage (52-64) comprises the sin of Tantalus who uses the divine gifts for limited human ends and thus turns divine favor to punishment. The third (66-99) is the attempt of Pelops, sent back to the world of mortal- ity, to regain the divine brilliance he knew once. In this stage the puri- fication of the gods is complete, for all the sinister elements of the first part of the poem are transferred to the limitations of man himself, made responsible for his loss of immortality by his misuse of the divine gifts. This transference is symbolically completed in sending Pelops "back to the swift-doomed race of men" (66). Throughout each of these stages runs a further alternation of darkness and light, of the "true" version of the Pelops myth (divine benevo- lence) and the cannibalistic story of his dismemberment. These con- trasting juxtapositions underlie the whole structure of the poem. Thus the story of the ivory shoulder (25-27) is followed by the warning against false mythoi (28-29), that again by the passage on charis (30-34), fol- lowed in its turn by the warning to speak good of the gods and the refer- ence to "guilt" or "responsibility" (aitia) 35. After this comes the bright narrative of Tantalus' closeness to the gods and Poseidon's love for Pelops (36-45); then the sinister myth of Pelops' "disappearance" (46-51), followed by the honor of the gods for Tantalus (54-55) and that in turn by his folly and punishment (55-65). These large contrasts in the central portion are succeeded once more by the story of Pelops (65ff) with its multiple interplay of both literal and figurative light and darkness, ending finally in the happiness and radiance. of immortal aglaia. All of the darker parts pertain to man's clouding and debasing of the divine, either through the misinterpretation of myths or through the misuse of divine gifts. Only in Pelops is the divine understood rightly and received properly-with full knowledge of the human position- and hence his success. This alternating structure, therefore, by relating human success and failure to the proper attitude to the gods, serves to clarify the transience and weakness (both moral and physical) of humanity vis h vis the divine. It also frees the divine of the evil attributed to it by the misunderstand- ings of men and indicates the human responsibility (see aitia, 35) for this evil. For the private man or poet to speak evil of the gods is the moral equivalent of Tantalus' demeaning of divine gifts: both bring remote- ness from the gods and even destruction. Man's speech about the gods must reflect what is " seemly" or "fitting" (eoikos, 35) for his nature and his relation with them, just as he "must seek from the gods with mortal thoughts that which is seemly (ta eoikota: what is within the realm of likelihood, and hence fitting, for the human condition), knowing that</page><page sequence="8">218 Charles Paul Segal which is nearest to hand (and) of what destiny (aisa) we are" (P.3.59f). This "purification" of the gods through the demarcation and separation of the human is, as pointed out above, essential for Pelops' attainment of his aglaia. Thus his success is, on one level, the positive proof of divine benevolence, refuting the evil imputations of the "false" Pelops myth, just as Tantalus' punishment is the negative proof of this benevo- lence, clearing the gods of ingratitude or wilful malice; and on another level Pelops' glory at Olympia is symbolic of man's potential to attain an element of divine radiance through meeting fully the truth of his mortality and striving in the face of it, with risk, for a lasting achieve- ment. To lessen the radiance, dangerous as it is, and the unattainable remoteness of the gods would also diminish the validity of what man can achieve by understanding and receiving the divine. The tripartite structure of the myth corresponds to a basic pattern of human action and suffering, indeed to the structure of life itself: the movement from the innocence and untroubled joy of childhood (the birth of Pelops, the amicable relation between Tantalus and the gods), to the loss of innocence, the misuse of this freely given bliss in folly and sin with its resultant punishment (Tantalus in Hades, the expulsion of Pelops), and finally to the attempt of man, having accepted the bitter- ness of his mortality to regain in some form the radiance and happiness he once knew. It is a pattern of birth, death, and rebirth which is per- haps adumbrated in the initiation-like story of Pelops' birth21 and in the alternation from light to dark to light in the poem. It is a pattern under- lying also the structure of tragedy, moving from acting to suffering to learning (poiema, pathema, mathema),22 and the Biblical story of Eden and the Fall of Man. Pindar has, in fact, carried the story of Pelops from his birth to his maturity and - through Pelops' own vision (82-84) - to old age, death, and his subsequent life in his descendants and fame. When Pelops is sent down from Olympus, he loses both his childhood and his immortality, unlike Ganymede, the youth who remains ever- young and ever-beautiful among the gods;23 and it is part of Pelops' mortal condition that this is a loss which cannot be repaired. In his prayer he acknowledges and accepts his loss, the impossibility of re- maining young or avoiding death, for although he achieves lasting fame and aglaia, these are not divine immortality, and his worship is the wor- ship of a hero, not a god (so haimakouriai, 90o, the blood-offerings proper to heroes or the dead).24 Though the whole course of Pelops' life is implicit in the poem, it is presented, as usual in Pindar, through a few intensely vivid moments. Yet it is typical of Pindar and this stage in Greek thought generally that</page><page sequence="9">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 219 there is little emphasis on the internal development, on the inward sense of "sin" and "learning" or remolding of character through suffering. Pindar is concerned rather with the basic facts of mortality, with man's position in the world defined externally and generically between the immutable essences of water, gold, and sun - the divine radiance - and the movement of human life to old age and death. The first part of the ode. (1-51) is filled with the divine light; the following portion (51-99) assumes the more somber tonality of the human. Pindar's large generic concern with the basic and profoundly simple facts of human mortality appears in such phrases as "the swift-doomed race of men," in Pelops' compressed and powerful utterance on the "neces- sity" of death and the darkness of old age (82-84), and perhaps in the gnomic sentence rounding off the Pelops' myth (99-1oo): "The glory (present) ever day by day comes as the highest (achievement) for each of mortal men," a statement ostensibly optimistic, yet perhaps reflecting something of the rich ambiguity, the deep sadness and radiant joy, of the whole myth and, indeed, of Pindar's presentation of the whole human situation.25 Thus it fitly marks the transition from the lasting glory and worship of the hero to the crowning of the contemporary victor, also radiant with the fame of his achievement (see 23, AIL[rE7 rd' ol KAEOc) but involved in time and change. Hence Pindar prefaces his statement of hope for Hieron's future victory with the phrase, "if he (Hieron's guardian divinity) fail not soon .. ." (io8); and in his conclud- ing prayer, he warns "Do not peer into the far beyond,"26 referring per- haps to the life after death and the finitude, therefore, of the joy of the present, however intense. It is typical also of Pindar's concern with the harshness and finality of death, unmitigated here by a spiritual rebirth through "learning" and "inner development" or by a redemption in an after-life, that the success which comes to Pelops comes only in part through his own effort, his acceptance of the risk (kindynos). It is truly realized (in the praxis of 85) through the spontaneous affinity between the divine brilliance and the beauty of Pelops, the violent and mysterious eros of the god (Poseidon, Zeus) for what is young, pure, and beautiful (Pelops, Ganymede). It may be that the glow of youthful beauty itself is felt as being in some way divine and hence attracting the divine to itself. The ivory shoulder perhaps itself symbolizes this insouciant flash and brilli- ance of youth, the firmness and radiance of young skin and flesh (cf. Solomon's Song, 7:4, " Thy neck is as a tower of ivory.. .")' Yet this same ivory shoulder is also an ambivalent symbol, for not only does it attract the eros of the gods but behind all its brightness (phaidimon, 27)</page><page sequence="10">220 Charles Paul Segal lurks the myth of its origin which Pindar seeks to refute, the accidental eating of the shoulder by Demeter, the goddess who herself gives to men for their nourishment the substance of their mortal lives in a cycle of fertility and barrenness, death and rebirth.27 The equivalent for mortals of this eros which emanates from the gods and snatches up its object violently is charis, the joy of attainment, "which devises all things sweet and gentle (-r&amp; c~ELLXa) for mortals" (30). This joy of success is associated with sweetness (as commonly in Pindar)28 and excites the poet to sing, almost spontaneously, of the victory of Hieron (i7ff), of which the victory of Pelops is the symbolic and mythical prototype.29 The poet calls for his lyre amid the "sweetest thoughts" (yAVKvU&amp;TaL&amp; qpovrlLuv, 19) that the charis of Hieron's victory suggests to his mind; and the sweetness of this moment en- riches, through the poet, the past superlatives and aglaia of Hieron (see I2ff). This sweetness recurs immediately after Pelops' victory too, but now in a generic formulation, the "honeyed calm" (pALEv'dauav Edtjav) which the Olympic victor enjoys for the rest of his life (97-98). Then, turning immediately back to Hieron (iooff), the poet hopes to find "a still sweeter (yAvKvrC'pav) path of words" for a future victory (0o9-1io). In all these passages charis and its sweetness at the moment of success are embodied in the poetic song that completes and perpetu- ates the victory. Because the entire ode, however, is concerned with the establishment of the moral rightness of the poetic mythoi and their puri- fication (e.g., 28-29, 52-53), the sweetness and charis of victory which excite the poet's song (I7ff) and which the song in turn bestows (lo9- i io) are given a moral foundation, and their meaning is expanded to include tacitly the victor's knowledge of the place of his achievement within the limitations and possibilities of human life. The myths of the poem are thus its moral substance, and against them emerges the mean- ing of the historical victory. This victory is thus placed in the range created between the honor given unsought by the gods to Tantalus and Pelops, the punishment of the former, and the ultimate success of the latter; between the vivid joy of the present (99-105) and the uncertain hope for the future (Io8ff, 114-15).3o The significance of charis throughout the poem, lying between the hope and joy of achievement and the risk of failure that are central elements in the story of Pelops (66-99), flows from the gnomic statement which powerfully opens the second strophe, "Charis who creates all things sweet and gentle for mortals, bringing (to them) honor (tima), devised even for the unbelievable to be believable many a time, but days to come are wisest witnesses" (30-34). This description of charis follows</page><page sequence="11">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 221 significantly the story of Poseidon's eros for Pelops, his removal from the "pure caldron," and his ivory shoulder (25-27) and the warning about the deception of false mythoi (28-29). It is followed, in its turn, not only by the ambivalent statement about "days to come," but also by another warning to speak well of the gods (35) and by the myth of Pelops' being snatched from the banquet (36ff). This fullest statement about charis thus comes at a point between the gods' offering of love (Poseidon), life, and beauty (Clotho) and man's distortion of the truth (27-28) and beauty of the gods (&amp;pl q8a&amp;cdvo0V KaAC, 35). In this con- text charis demarcates the area of what is possible for mortals (hence OvaroZt at the end of 30); it is the positive aspect of man's recognizing his mortal limitations, and has thus also a moral significance. In the story of Ixion in P.2, therefore, parallel in part to that of Tantalus in 0.1 (see esp. P.2.25ff), where these limits have been transgressed and the proper relation between God and man violated, the Charites are grimly absent, the offspring of Ixion's union with the deceptive cloud- image of Hera being awv XapiTwv (42). Charis does appear there, however, in Apollo's love for Cinyras (P.2.I7, also an erotic relation- ship as in O.I.75ff). Mortal man, though he may not enjoy the eros of Poseidon for Pelops nor be endowed with Pelops' beauty (25-26), may at least, by speaking well of the gods (27-28, 35), avoid the destruction which Tantalus' profanation brought upon him. The tima which charis brings (31), like the sweetness it brings to the Olympic victor, mediated through the poet (19, 98, io9), is thus the mortal analogue of the lasting aglaia or kleos of the hero (9off); and in its intensity of joy and its con- nection with an active achievement under the good will of the gods (see io8ff) it is the antithesis of the static, hopeless enduring of punishment by Tantalus who "yearning always to cast from his head the stone wanders far from delight of mind" (euphrosyne, 58). It is this charis, too, for which Pelops asks after his return to mortality (66). He can no longer expect the divine eros as it came to him in its full presence when he was taken "from the pure caldron" (25-26, 4off). Thus he begins his prayer: " If the kindly gifts of Cypris, O Poseidon, are a source of joy and favor (E' Xdpvy 7'AAEraL, 75-76), fetter the bronze spear of Oenomaus."3' Charis, as ta meilicha in 30 imply, con- notes a relation of gentleness wherein beauty, joy, and success become communicable to mortals in softer, milder ways than the sudden eros of Poseidon (so too Pelops' request for "a friendly fulfillment of action," praxin philan, 85; cf. philia, 75). Charis makes it possible for Pelops to call upon Poseidon in terms of a comprehensible human relationship and not in the absolute terms of man facing God, though Pelops must also</page><page sequence="12">222 Charles Paul Segal undergo the agony and isolation of this latter, absolute relationship in calling out for the god in the dark (71-73) before he can invoke the charis of his past love (75). Charis thus transfigures the divine brilliance into a beauty and joy which men can understand and receive, yet without destroying or debasing the nature of the divine, as did Tantalus, or ex- ploding and dazzling the limited receptive powers of humanity, like the sun in the bare sky (5-6). In this attempt to bring the divine into human life lies, in part, the risk, the kindynos, of Pelops (81). His daring and imagination stand in significant contrast to the grosser, unimaginative aspirations of Tantalus (60-64). Pindar is not explicit as to whether the purpose of Tantalus' theft was actually to make his mortal companions immortal; but if this was so, as later tradition suggests (e.g., Philostratus, Life of Apollonius 3.25.2), then his deed would be another, still more serious violation of charis, setting at naught the limits of mortal nature and the order of the universe. The gods do not take back their gift, but convert it into an immortality of suffering. Pelops is given a second chance at the relation between human and divine, but Tantalus enjoys neither the gods' eternal happiness nor man's final respite from pain in death. The right relation to the divine implied in charis thus involves a balance between being sought and seeking, between the passive accept- ance of what is given and active self-assertion. Pelops and Tantalus illustrate a true and false - or successful and unsuccessful - establish- ment of the balance. Pelops affirms it in his prayer to Poseidon (84-85): " But to me (twot' pttdv) this contest will lie proposed; but do you (7- 8E) give (S[lo0) friendly fulfillment of action." Tantalus, however, converts the voluntary favor of the gods into a deed of robbery. Hence Pindar's suggestion that Tantalus actually stole (klepsais, 6o), rather than received as a gift, "the nectar and ambrosia with which they (the gods) made him immortal" (63-64). He perverts the acceptance of a freely offered good - the source of charis - into a negative self-assertion for narrow ends, a misdirected "giving" (63) of his own. Thus by his theft he not only does not receive properly, but acts in violent contravention of the deli- cately balanced bond between God and man that constitutes charis.32 He is punished with eternally unsatisfied desires, and the stone above his head is itself the unremitting negation of the possibility of happiness. Pindar perhaps adumbrates more clearly the two ways of acting in his use of the verb 'AEv, "took (violently), seized," employed vividly and emphatically first of Tantalus' "taking" of "overweening disastrous folly (ate)" (56), and then of the successful outcome of Pelops' contest, when the hero "took the force (bia) of Oenomaus and the maiden (to be)</page><page sequence="13">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 223 the sharer of his bed" (88). In both passages the usage of the verb is striking: in the first (at the end of a verse) with the semi-abstract ate; in the second (at the beginning of a verse) with a daring zeugma. The parallel shows the first taking, with evil intent, leading to a short- lived pleasure and eternal punishment and infamy, and the second, in accordance with the will of the gods, bringing lasting happiness and honor. The first is an act of assertive violence, analogous to the "steal- ing"; the second is a sanctioned and rightful "taking" that is almost a receiving. This balance between "taking" and "receiving" is present for Hieron too who enjoys the sweetness of charis (18-19) because his horse won, "setting forth his body unpricked by spur in the race- course" (tE/ac &amp;KEVT~7TOV E V 8pdOpLoto rapXOwv, 20-21). The victory thus offers itself freely and spontaneously, through charis, to the victor, in the sense that his balanced capability to receive passively as well as to act makes it natural and almost inevitable that he should enjoy the victory. The victory is thus not simply a result of physical strength, but depends immediately upon the prayer, wherein the hero establishes the right relation with the god and accepts the weakness of the human situation. In Pindar's heroic world the valorous youth seeking the god need not ask what a man must do to compensate for the "necessity" (82) of death and the brevity of life; he knows with determination, but he must ask the god for the force to accomplish his resolution. Moral strength and truthfulness are required of the hero to approach the god properly, keeping open the sensitive potentiality of charis; imagination and insight to see the risks and implications of both error and success. The test of the hero is, in part, to meet and use the active forces of the divine that lead him to victory, but yet to remain in inward control of these forces, to check them in accordance with the limits of his human- ity. The Pindaric hero might be compared with the contemporary bronze Charioteer, at Delphi - dedicated in fact by Hieron's brother - who stands calm and self-contained after the tension and effort of the race, holding back with his slender but powerful arms the still violently excited, straining, and heated horses. The assertion of this moral strength to attain charis, and its whole moral foundation, are valid, moreover, not only for the mythical hero, but on other levels as well, as the central passage on charis (3off) makes clear. The context, as already pointed out above, places it in contact with the divine eros, the poetic logos, and gnomic truths of human life. This last, the aphoristic treatment of charis here and the aphorisms which follow (33-35), relate it most immediately to the broad generic</page><page sequence="14">224 Charles Paul Segal facts of human existence: mortal weakness and uncertainty before the future ("Days to come are wisest witnesses," 33-34), a subject to which Pindar returns obliquely at the end of the poem (io8, 114-15). The exhortation to men to speak well of the gods (35) connects the poet's task with the more general subject of the righteous life for the ordinary man. Both are to avoid blasphemous utterance. The charis of the poet, moreover, is related also to that of the hero and the victor in that he too, through the truthfulness of his mythoi, is seeking to establish the right relation with the divine. The poetic "deed" for Pindar is to approach the gods lyrically, bringing their brilliance to men without debasing their nature. The poet too is faced with a negative and a positive possibility, the false and true stories about Tantalus and Pelops. His task is to detach the truth, ennobling heroic beauty and excellence (Poseidon's eros for Pelops and Pelops' victory over Oenomaus) and placing blame where it is due (the sin of Tantalus). He too faces a risk in singing of things "opposite to what was previously said" (&amp;wv-ra ipo-rEdpcv, 36) and hopes for fame and success analogous to that of the victors (I I6).33 In another poem (N.7.zoff) the sense of risk involved in false mythoi is strong enough for Pindar to attribute the death of Ajax to the inability of the mob to "see the truth" (24-26). He often speaks, moreover, of the risks involved in his boldness of language and his fear that he is stepping beyond the due limits of his art (e.g., P.I.44, N.7-71- 73, 0-13-93-95, P.I1.38-40). In the First Olympian, however, the poet, like the hero, is concerned with communication with the divine, in- tegrating it into the limited framework of mortality. He must "stand away" from the stories of the gods' gluttony (52) and establish the moral purity and veracity of the mythoi he must use (27-28). In the ambiguity of the phrase, El 8E t/L- raVXb Alorrot (io8), furthermore, referred by the scholia both to the future uncertainty of the good for- tune of Hieron and to the poetic Muse of Pindar, the poet is perhaps associating his own risk in approaching the divine with that of the victor and the hero who attempt to reach beyond the limits of their mortality.34 The use of the words I3EAor and &amp;AKg (the latter recalling Pelops' aMAKLW, 8I) in Pindar's personal statement in i i i, "For me then the Muse is nourishing with strength of valor a most strong miss- ile," further suggests his association of poetry with heroic action, both requiring truthfulness and valor.35 His equation of his hoped-for poetic excellence (sophia) with the victory of the king in the last line of the ode, however, not only connects in a closer unity the quasi-heroic achieve- ment of the poet with the moral task and attainment of the victor, but also asserts that the poet, like Pelops, has met the risk and succeeded.</page><page sequence="15">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 225 Charis as the successful communication between God and man, man's propitious receiving of divine favor in accordance with his ability to act, is thus a strong unifying motif throughout the entire poem. Its multiva- lent moral significance is defined in the generic formulation of 30-32, in a context between mythic narration of gods and heroes (25-27) and gnomic truths about humanity (27-28, 33-35). Farnell is thus mistaken in regarding charis as "not wholly appropriate here,"36 for it is relevant not only to the success of Pelops within the framework of the poem, but also to Pindar's attitude toward poetry and, indeed, to his view of the human situation generally and the possibility of human happiness, the broad themes that expand outward from the poem. The significance of charis thus arises from man's position between dangerous opposites - a position shared also by hero and poet - confronting the empty barren- ness of old age and death (82-84), yet unable to endure divine brilliance when given (55ff). Charis, however, transmutes risk to fulfillment and falsehood to truth, bringing glory and attainment from the gods at the moment of kindynos when failure is as likely as success. In "devising the unbelievable to be believable many a time" (31-32) charis appears at the point of suspension when hope becomes reality and the future be- comes vivid present. It is with the uncertain future, however, that Pindar ends the ode (io8ff, 114-15), a reminder perhaps that the "un- believable" does not always become "believable," that what charis does "many a time" (7r ToAAd&amp;KLS, 32) it does not do always, for the presence of charis is contingent not only upon the unpredictable good will or eros of the god, but also upon the acceptance of risk and the exertion of moral strength by hero, poet, and mortal. Thus charis, like the story of Pelops itself and the significance of the Olympian victory wherein it is embodied, comes to reflect the intensity and poignancy of man's aspirations beyond his mortality. And, as Pelops moves from the gold and brillance of Poseidon's love (25ff) to the dark- ness of his mortal fate (65ff), so the flashing joy in Hieron's victory in the first antistrophe (12ff) becomes both sadder and more intense after the recognition of the transience of human achievement follGwing the Pelops myth ("the glory present ever day by day comes as highest to each of mortals," 99-00oo) and the overshadowings of the present "sweetness" (19, 1o9) by the uncertainty of the future (io8). Thus the story of Pelops at the beginning of the ode, introduced in part by the optimism about charis in 30ff, becomes the vehicle for conveying the grimness of mortality at the end. He calls for charis now (75) out of the fullest sense of mortality, when the divine eros from which charis derives lies in the past and must be summoned from the darkness. 8 + H.S.C.P.</page><page sequence="16">226 Charles Paul Segal This darkness (71) after Pelops' dismissal from Olympus (66) not only contrasts with the light in the opening strophe of the poem, as pointed out above, but represents also the symbolical darkness, both metaphysical and psychological, of Pelops' recognition of his mortality which becomes explicit in 82-84. His calling upon this past eros for charis is even more poignant, for it emphasizes the change and move- ment in human life, wherein a vivid present becomes a dim past, in con- trast with the permanence of the gods for whom the intense eros (25, 41) is an ever-present potential, always capable of realization with the same brilliant power. Pelops' loss is for himself irreparable, but Zeus in the next generation can summon another youth, Ganymede, "for the same task" (43-45).37 The "hoary seal" too represents a power outside of the cycle of human flux and suffering, outside of the suffering of Pelops himself at this moment, unchanging and unyielding while the youth, with the bloom of his cheeks fresh upon him, foreplans his involvement in manly contests and mortal dangers. The sea perhaps refers back to the divine element- ality of water in the first line of the poem with its remote, brilliant super- latives. Here, however, when the narrative has focused our interest on an individual person, its permanence, vastness, impenetrability, and in- difference only set off the weakness and uncertainty of the youth beside it. The tragic implications of the contrast are further deepened by the Homeric echoes of the phrase TroAtcL &amp;AdAO, associated in the Iliad (e.g., 1.349-350) with the solitude and grief of Achilles, calling to his goddess- mother:38 Weeping he sat apart from his companions, by the shore of the hoary sea, looking out to the limitless ocean (OW,' 4,a' 0A&amp; 7roAL c.~pcdw , &amp;, a7TELpOva o Tc-rov). The phrase and the situation recall also the lonely prayer of Telemachus in the Odyssey (2.26off) seeking from the god the courage to venture over " the misty ocean " whereon lie his father and the proof of his heroic paternity. The poignancy of Pelops' mortality set against the divine and ele- mental natural world, is enhanced too by the richness of the language of 67-69, the beginning of the narrative portion of Pelops' victory, just following his dismissal "back to the swift-doomed race of men" (65- 66). The juxtaposition of words like &amp;Oava-roL (65), 'aX Vr'Okov (66), and EV~&amp;vy6eov (67) is especially effective. The "well-flowering growth" (or "stature," euanthemon phyan), the down shadowing his cheeks</page><page sequence="17">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 227 (where the light-dark alternation in the imagery of the poem perhaps gives a slightly sinister connotation to the "black" chin and the verb VEpEiOV, "cover," 68), and the following gamos (69) all suggest Pelops' full entrance into the cycle of human life, the process of growth, beget- ting offspring, dying, so that his gamos contrasts with the freer, unbound, non-mortal eros or kypris (75) of Poseidon.39 This intensification of the sense of change and mortality in the introductory passage (65-69) makes all the more pressing Pelops' need for attainment, for life, marriage, deeds of heroic valor; hence the urgency and immediacy of his prayer. Because of his past contact with the divine, however, he is able to reach a permanent brilliance (aglaiai, 91) and fame (kleos, 93-94) embodied in the recurring ritual at Olympia. His marriage will be fruitful with sons who are "leaders of the people" (AayraL) and endowed with aretai (89). Two of his sons, however, will not leave a happy memory: Atreus and Thyestes. But Pindar is silent on this point and does not suggest any further alteration in Pelops' happiness.40 He does, however, move at once from the confident brightness of this symbolic-narrative style (Pelops' victory) back to the broad realities of mortal life in the gnomic passage 97-Ioo. Here the phrases AoLTurv &amp;l fllo-rov (suggesting that some part of the victor's life is already past and the remainder is limited and precious) and a5 38' alEl rrapaEpov E'acrv imply a qualification even of the "honeyed calm" of an Olympian victory; and the note is struck for the modulation back to the uncertainties of mortal life in Io6- Ix and 14-16. The polarity of God and man in the First Olympian thus reaches a poignancy, especially in the story of Pelops' contest (66-Ioo), which reflects the intensity of Pindar's grasp of the basic human confrontation with death. Youthful beauty, the eros of the gods, success, fame, all illuminate the dark futility which human life can also be or become (82- 84). This intensity of feeling remains with Pindar even in his latest odes: Creatures of a day; what is one, what is one not? A dream of a shadow is man, but when the radiance (aigla) Zeus-given, comes, there is upon men a bright light and a gentle time of life (P.8.95-97). The alternation of bright and dark, achievement and emptiness, truth and falsehood, love and violence, elemental eternity and changing humanity, is coincident and simultaneous with the alternation of God and man. Man is faced with the dazzling reality of the divine eros. To bring it into his life requires the heroic strength to accept first the deep- est negative implications of mortality, to stand alone and in darkness by the unchanging, unpitying sea, yet at the same time not to forget his past</page><page sequence="18">228 Charles Paul Segal contact with the divine and the potentialities it symbolizes. Yet the very act of accepting mortality and the willingness to undergo risk in Pelops' prayer are the implicit grounds of its fulfillment. Despite Pelops' victory and consequent fame, despite Hieron's wealth (io) and glory (23), still the elemental water, gold, and sun at the beginning of the poem remain unattainable. The hero can establish the lasting validity of his victory only by creating an intermediate ritual framework, the Olympian festival. Thus the poem moves from the absolute, divine force, the sun in the empty sky, to the hero-created ritual with its tempered brightness (aglaia) of lasting fame. This temp- ering of the divine is the theme of the Third Olympian too, but there the ritual is given more easily, without the agony of Pelops, from the willing- ness of a semi-divine hero to foster gently beauty for men. Human life there is thus presented as already partially enclosed in a benevolent, mitigating framework, whereas in the First Olympian the man-hero must himself create the ritual framework in an open and dangerous world. Hence though the First Olympian ends in triumph, it is a triumph gained only through the fullest acceptance of the negative implications of mortality. The joy and radiance of Pelops' fame do not cancel fully the darkness and suffering of his prayer. II It is possible to regard the Third Olympian too as containing a dual- ity of forces which, on a different level and with a lessening of tension, corresponds to the interplay of man and God, darkness and light, in the First Olympian. The Third Olympian presents an antinomy between the violence and gentleness of the hero, the harshness and benignity of nature and the gods; but here the two sides are not in such dangerous oscillation as in the First Olympian and are more easily and more fully resolved into a favorable balance. The negative side of the powerful natural forces in the Third Olympian never emerges fully from the back- ground. Instead, this potential violence - the sharpness of the rays of the sun (24), Artemis the "horse driving daughter of Leto" in the wild Arcadian valleys (26ff), the chase of the hind with the golden horns (29ff) - is tempered and turned to benevolence at the critical point. The myth itself has a relaxed "looseness" of movement: it begins with the wonder-filled journey to the magical Hyperborean land (14-16) and comes only at the end to the chase of the hind (28ff), the one explicit element of violence in the ode. The chase itself is interrupted by Heracles' astonishment at the Hyperborean trees and his "sweet</page><page sequence="19">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 229 desire" (33) to transplant them to Olympia. Thus, though the "neces- sity from his father" (i.e., Zeus, 28) to capture the hind in accordance with Eurystheus' commands remains darkly in the background, it does not fetter or oppress the hero absolutely - as does the ever-present, driving "necessity" of mortality behind Pelops' deed. It leaves him free to respond sympathetically to the beauties of the world. Similarly, though the effort for the victory is perhaps implicit in the "contests" (&amp;dEOAwv) of I5, the emphasis is not upon the isolated daring and spirit of challenge, as in the First Olympian (84-85). Rather it lies on the beauty of the olive crown, "the bluish-grey colored adornment of the olive tree" (yAavKdxpocZ KdO'LOV Aaalas, i3b), and on the fruitfulness of the growing tree, which then not only replaces the hunting of the hind as the object of Heracles' quest (28-34), but serves a protective, life- fostering purpose in sheltering the Olympian grove from the "sharp rays of the sun" (24). Both the First and Third Olympians, then, are pervaded by the sense that man lives his life amid powers that both give and destroy life. In O.I the destructive possibilities, and hence the danger, predominate intensifying man's need to act and act rightly. In 0.3, however, fertility and beneficence are more prominent, filling the human and heroic worlds with a softer, more easily attainable beauty. The violence, bloodshed, and persistent overcoming of obstacles and hostilities usually associated with the mythical Heracles, therefore, are subdued in favor of a gentleness which plants trees and promotes rather than destroys life. Even in obtaining the trees from the Hyperboreans he acts not through force, but by "persuading by word (TErlras . . Aody') a people.., .serving Apollo" (16). This fructifying gentleness is all the more striking when compared with his foundation of the Olymp- ian games amid battle and bloody strife in the Tenth Olympian, hinted at also in 0.2 (3-4), the ode written for the same victory as 0.3.41 Yet elsewhere too in Pindar Heracles is associated with life and fertility. Thus the First Nemean begins with the richness of the Sicilian earth, given by Zeus to Persephone (i4ff), mixes the birth of Heracles "when he came from the entrails of his mother into the wondrous glory of light, fleeing the birth pangs" with his infant prowess in strangling the snakes (35-47), and ends with his receiving of blooming (OaAEpcdv) Hebe, the embodiment of youth and fresh beauty, as his bride on Olympus. Even more strikingly, in the Sixth Isthmian he can sack Troy and slay "the tribes of the Meropes" (I.6.27ff); but also, wearing the lion skin as the symbol for his victorious contests (&amp;d'OAwv) and his first kill (I.6.48b) he can pray Zeus for a son for Telamon (I.6.42ff). In the Third Olympian,</page><page sequence="20">230 Charles Paul Segal Pindar goes even further and makes Heracles' aethlos primarily an act of creation, fertilization, and protection.42 Hence he inverts the order of events in the myth and indeed invents new elements in order to begin and end with the Hyperboreans and the olive trees. With this intent, also, he subordinates the violent action of the chase and modifies even that, through Artemis' gracious receiving of Heracles (26-27), to- ward the benevolent attitude set in the whole poem. The myth itself ends with the significant verb VTEutaL, "to plant" (34, cf. 18), con- taining also the root meaning of "growth." In this treatment of Heracles, Pindar may here be drawing upon a deep layer of myth in which Heracles had fertility functions: the legend of his founding of the Olympian festival may be associated with this promotion of fertility, though it is not entirely certain that originally the purpose of this foundation was "to inaugurate the fertility of the year."43 One foundation legend, however, records that it was the Idaean Heracles, in the service of the Great Mother of Crete (and hence associated with vegetation and growth) from whom the practice of crowning the victor has its origin (Pausanias 5.7.7).44 His benevolent life-promoting aspect became well developed in his role as "averter of evil" (alexikakos), which included agricultural functions, the warding off of the worm and the wolf.45 At Hyettos in Boeotia he was worshiped as a god of healing.46 From Homer onward, moreover, he has a double existence as both once-mortal hero (hence found in the lower world in Odyssey 11.601-3) and dweller in heaven, thus sharing both Olympian and "chthonian" elements.47 By Pindar's time the gentle, fertilizing aspect of his divinity coexists with his capacity for deeds of violence and well-intentioned killing of giants and monsters (e.g., see 1.4.56-63) and helps make more intelligible his role in the Third Olympian. An Attic coin with a representation going back to the early fifth century even shows the hero holding in one hand a club and in the other a cornu- copia, and a votive relief from Pindar's Thebes shows the hero " peace- fully receiving the horn of plenty from the hands of Hades-Plouton."48 This aspect of his divinity may reflect a basic attitude toward the vital elements in the natural and human world common in both primitive and more complex agricultural societies, wherein martial force and fertility are complementary and coexistent powers, united in a single divine figure. Here the fruitfulness of the fields is still associated with the virile power of the warrior.49 Thus the Roman Mars (Mavors) has closely fused functions as a god of fertility and of martial force. This pattern of the vital alternation of destructive violence with fructifying gentleness is deeply rooted in the entire Mediterranean world,50</page><page sequence="21">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 231 appearing, for example, in the myths of Persephone and Demeter as told in the Homeric Hymn (with the bestowing of immortal life upon Demophon through burning in the otherwise destructive fire, 239ff); appearing in Pindar's Zeus himself, who can support the sleeping eagle on his scepter as it is charmed by the golden lyre, but also blast piti- lessly down to Tartarus the hundred-headed Typho (P.I.I-2o); in Hora, "messenger of Aphrodite's endearments" who "raises one with gentle hands of necessity but another with other hands" (N.8.I-3); in the rhythmic movements of the black fields which can now give life to men, now withhold it (N.6.8-II, N.II.37-43)- The same complex of elements is perhaps present in Artemis (see below) and the Dioscuri in the ode. The Dioscuri (whose connection with the supervision of the Olympian festival may be a Pindaric innova- tion51) are helpful and useful divinities, the "saviors of mortal men" (Homeric Hymn 33.6ff) who bring "calm after storm" (P.5.9-I ). But the horse with which they are associated is also the companion of the warrior, the participant in his active, violent deeds; its taming in Homer confers a martial distinction on the warrior ("horse-taming Trojans" and see the simile in Iliad 6.5off, of Paris);52 and its heroic significance, as seen in O. I, continues in the races at Olympia. At the opening of the Third Olympian Pindar mollifies these forceful connotations of the horse in calling his hymn "the bloom of horses tireless of foot," thus canceling the active connotations of JKcaLVTc7vro8rov (a word used as an epithet of thunder in 0.4.1) with the quieter ~wrov which belongs in the same realm of imagery as the trees and the planting (18, 34). The shad- ing olive trees are in fact planted next to the racecourse (the hippodrome, 33-34).53 Artemis too is "horse-driving" (nrwrooda, 26, an epithet un- usual for her,54 though perhaps not entirely out of keeping with her wild and active pursuits as goddess of the hunt; but the epithet is signific- antly applied at the moment when she has "received" the wandering hero, 27). When the word "well-horsed" (euhippoi) recurs in 39 as the epithet of the Dioscuri it is with a benevolent sense, at the Theoxenia when they are to give (&amp;80dvyrwv) glory to Theron because of his rever- ence. The warlike possibilities of the horses too are thus set into a con- text of festivity and benevolence. Pindar's treatment of the mythical material of the ode pacifies the sinister, destructive elements through reconciliation and accord. This reconciliation is especially interesting in the figures of Artemis and Tay- geta. Artemis is the ambivalent goddess of the wild, associated with wild trees and wild animals, but here more clearly as the protector of animals, the rr'vLax Opp(pv, than as their huntress and destroyer.55 She</page><page sequence="22">232 Charles Paul Segal is the goddess who sends death, though often a gentle death, in Homer,56 who "makes the tops of the lofty mountains to tremble" and frightens the wild beasts, but can also join with the Muses and Graces in "the lovely dance" in the "rich land of Delphi" (Hom. Hymn 27.7-2zo),who can blight the land or bring it fertility (Callimachus, Hymn 3.122- I35).57 It is the fertilizing, fostering role in which she appears here, interceding with the hunter for the hunted animal. She is associated also with the savage Northland as the cruel Istrian Artemis especially honored by the Amazons, or the Taurian Artemis worshiped by the Scythians (scholion 46a). This aspect of her divinity retreats into the background, for the North - the Ister River (Danube) and the Hyper- boreans - is presented not as a frozen, hostile region (though the cold is mentioned, 31-32) but as the source of the wild olive for the games. Hence the epithet "shady" applied to the "springs" of the Ister suggests the mild, comforting function of the olive as the "shady plant" (14) which protects the grove from the sun (23-24). This aspect of the Ister and the North coincides, too, with the associations of Artemis with springs and watery places where vegetation abounds,58 so that the fertilizing sides of both the Northland and the goddess reinforce one another. The trees suggest too the life-giving powers of nature as embodied in Artemis as the goddess also of wild and uncultivated trees and, sig- nificantly as Artemis Orthia (see 30), worshiped as a tree- or fertility- goddess.59 The tree in general has deep-seated associations in the Mediterranean world with the life-giving goddess of nature, in part as the tree of life, "whose fruits are cast into the ground for the renewal of life."60 There is, in fact, a large body of evidence indicating that trees played an important part in ancient cults as symbols of fruitfulness; 61 and Pindar, with his interest in local cults and his upbringing in Boeotia, rich in diverse, often very ancient cults, would certainly be steeped in awareness of the religious-symbolic significance of trees.62 It is per- haps of further significance that Pindar calls the tree ,AZa (i3b), i.e., the tame, not the wild olive, the symbol of civilization and, in Athens at least, of the gods' life-giving beneficence63 (it is usually the wild olive, kotinos, which Heracles is said to bring back from the Hyperboreans - e.g., Pausanias 5.7.7)."4 In bringing back the olive trees from the North, Heracles is thus bringing a gentle fruitfulness to men, over- coming the risk of cold and frozen barrenness.65 This risk of death and sterility, never emerging fully from the mythi- cal background but still vaguely present in it, appears also in Heracles' hunting of "the golden horned doe (or hind) which once Taygeta, dedi-</page><page sequence="23">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 233 cating, inscribed as sacred to (Artemis) Orthia" (29-3o).46 The myth is one of the hunter pursuing the helpless animal, man intruding into the wild freedom of nature (thus Heracles is "coming from the ridges and many-bending hollows of Arcadia," 27). Such a pursuit can be danger- ous, for it is a potential violation of nature. The animal, moreover, is sacred to Artemis who, as goddess of the fertile woodland and moun- tains, is also laden with the destructive power of the wild. There are, indeed, myths of the violent deaths of hunters killed as they are led on in pursuit of an animal, a doe or a boar, which is sacred to the goddess, "or more correctly, the doe is the goddess, and there remains a trace of theriomorphism in these legends."67 Instead of the destruction of the hunter by the goddess, however, the theme of the hunt here fades and is replaced by the goddess' kindly reception of him (27); Heracles brings back the olive tree, not the body of the hunted prey.68 Implicit in the Taygeta-Artemis episode is also the contest between an active, assertive male power and a female element, associated with the vitality of the natural world, which is threatened with outrage. Not only is Heracles' pursuit of the hind a potential violation of nature which, through Artemis' intervention, is not realized, but the story of Taygeta reflects such a violation, for according to the scholiast (53c) "Artemis made her into a doe when Zeus wished to force her. Then when she became human again, she consecrated the doe to Artemis and dedicated it with golden horns. . ." The story is attested also on the throne at Amyclae, where Pausanias (3.18.0o) describes a scene, of "those not unknown," in which "Poseidon and Zeus carry off Taygeta, daughter of Atlas, and her sister Alcyone." The myth itself may go deeper, the pre-Hellenic name and personage of Taygeta, her animal form and association with Artemis suggesting the contest of the active male Hellenic god with the quiet but mysterious primordial forces of nature and the wild.69 The rape behind the Taygeta story, however, is again kept by Pindar in the background, behind the hero's benign meeting with Artemis: "The pre-Greek goddess turns into Artemis Orthia and establishes harmonious agreement with the Hellenes whom Heracles represents." o There is perhaps a parallel adumbration of another male-female con- test in the phrase avdyKa r7ra7pOEV, "the necessity from his father" (29) which compels Heracles to capture the hind. The phrase refers to the story, told in the Iliad (19.95-133), of the deception of Zeus by Hera at the time of Heracles' birth, her trick giving Eurystheus power to com- mand (&amp;yyEAhcaLs, 28) the Zeus-born hero. It serves as a reminder of the enmity of Hera toward Heracles (elaborated in Pindar's First 8*</page><page sequence="24">234 Charles Paul Segal Nemean) and the hostility generally lurking in the world. In the poem itself, however, this faint allusion to the hostility of Hera is canceled by the benevolence of the other female figure, Artemis; and the mistrust and deception between Hera and Zeus remain dim in the past before the benignity of the present. Thus Heracles in his relationship with the female power, Hera, Artemis, the doe, does not re-enact the violence of Zeus toward Tay- geta. Nature offers its fertility without harsh extortion, and Heracles is able to obtain the wild olives from the Hyperboreans by persuasion (I6). This "persuasion" of the people who "serve Apollo" (16) contains per- haps another adumbration of conflict ending in gentle resolution, for in an early legend Heracles appears as opposing Apollo for the hind.71 The possibility of resolution by persuasion and conciliatory reception re- flects perhaps a deeper fusion in Pindar's thought between the un- chained fertility of the wild and the benign order of the Olympian gods.72 Artemis, the Hyperborean trees, the hind, thus contribute their rich, but ambivalent vitality to an ordered human festival celebrating the ruler of Olympus and the guardian of universal harmony. The golden horns, too, apparently a fixed part of the Taygeta legend according to the scholiasts (53c-d) - horned does being rare, but possible in Greek mythology7" - are of significance as the symbolic conduits of vitality through which man touches and takes into himself the vital, electrical powers of nature that course through the swift hind and are definitively embodied in its horns. The grasping of horns from earliest times was the way of drawing the animal vitality of nature into oneself; they serve as a " fountain of energy" through which this fertilizing force is channeled.74 For Pindar, furthermore, the gold, as seen in the First Olympian, is the symbol for the blaze of glory which comes from the sublimity of the divine and enters human life suddenly (0.1.41) or is sought with danger (O.1.87)."5 This element of danger and unpre- dictable vitality is doubled here by the association of horns with the primordial energy of nature embodied in the animal consecrated to the goddess. Farnell has sought to give a ritual explanation of the golden horns: The story may have arisen from a certain ritual, namely, the con- secration and occasional sacrifice of stags to Artemis, the goddess of stags in Arcadia; the golden horns might be a reminiscence of the old sacrificial custom, handed down from Minoan-Mycenaean days, of wrapping gold leaf round the horns of the victim. The idea would arise that no one but a great hero like Heracles would dare to chase one of these sacrosanct animals: therefore he probably did.76</page><page sequence="25">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 235 But Pindar's hero, at the moment when he would grasp the horns and slay the doe, taking her free-flowing animal vitality into himself but also violating the untamed world of the virgin goddess, looks up and sees the olive trees: "Pursuing her he saw also that land beyond cold Boreas; then he stood in wonder at the trees" (31-32). He would seem to have forgotten the hind and brings back instead a gentler, less dangerous, less ambivalent form of the fertility of nature. The hero is not forced to the final confrontation with the unmitigated power of divine gold or with the brute might of the natural world. Instead, he is permitted as a valid achievement a deed which fosters life and shades the earth; and this deed is implicitly the prototype for the contests of men at Olympia. The act of crowning the victor with the olive branch brings him too into contact with that same vitality, over which Artemis, as goddess both of wild animals and wild trees, presides. The victor's wearing of the life-giving olive branch, itself cut from the sacred tree planted by Heracles (Paus. 5.15-3), would be the human equivalent of the hero's grasping of the golden horns. He is crowned with olive through "the behests of Heracles" (IIff), who has thus brought to the individual victor the primal vitality of the earth and the wild, just as he has sur- rounded the sacred place for all future participants in the festival with the fruitful symbols of life.77 And this transfer of vitality is accomplished gently, with the acquiescence of the divinity who most fully possesses these powers. Thus Pindar's fusion of the hunt of the goddess' sacred animal and the bringing back of the trees not only converts a more sav- age to a gentler form of vitality, but also intensifies the power and range of this vitality that the hero himself can confront and master: on his own level he can pursue (and attain) the golden-horned hind, but for men he brings back only the trees. Not only are the hero's deeds benevolent, but also his impulses are gentle and life-giving. His wish to plant the trees about the Olympian racecourse is "a sweet desire" (YAVKiS lEpoS), sweet not only because its intent is benevolent but because its fulfillment is made possible by the total gentleness of the divine order. This gentleness overrules the harshness and original intent of the hunt: the suddenness, the free and spontaneous character of his admiration for the trees, cancels the "necessity from his father," Zeus (29) that originally sent him forth. This severer, commanding aspect of Zeus, equivalent to the imperative anagke which drives Pelops to risk and action in the First Olympian (82), retreats behind the fostering presence of the god. The benevolent order of Zeus celebrated by the festival makes possible the "persuasion" (16) of the Hyperboreans, and his presence at various points throughout the</page><page sequence="26">236 Charles Paul Segal ode also provides a recurring assurance of this order and benevolence. It is for his grove (Aus- ... . AcrUE, 17-18) that Heracles makes his re- quest of the Hyperboreans; the altars are consecrated to him (frr-'rpt, 19); and it is "necessity" from him (-aTrpdOEv, 28) that has led Heracles to the Hyperboreans. From the conciliating effect of his presence flow also the friendliness of the Tyndarids at the beginning and end of the poem and the graciousness of Artemis. Thus, the purpose of the hero's request, his intent, and the connec- tion with Zeus sanction the fruitfulness of the journey and its outcome. 78 Heracles seeks the gift in the spirit of benefaction. His purpose itself includes the propitious linking of man and God at a ritual celebration which is itself a mark of the favor of the gods for men 79and is the sym- bolic analogue of Theron's present festival, the Theoxenia. The olive trees join men and gods under the symbol of growth and life, freeing the active strivings of men for excellence in the ritual contests under the good will of the gods, present in the "shady plant" (18) and the shade from the sun (24). Whereas in the First Olympian light is a major sym- bol of the divine, in the Third it is shade, the tempered mean between the blazing sun and Pelops' dark prayer in Olympian I. That the Hyperboreans should be devoted to the service of Apollo (16) is also significant, for Pindar thus combines in the Northland the ordered intelligence of the arts and civilization which Apollo sponsors (see P.5.63-69) and the august morality embodied in the god (see P.9-. 42-49) with the primitive vital forces of nature symbolized by Artemis and the hind of the golden horns. Even at the frozen limits of the world the hero can find "a people serving Apollo." The Apollonian connec- tions of the Hyperboreans reinforce the possibility of approaching them with persuasion (16) and thus releasing for the world of men the fertil- ity and beauty which lie locked in that remote and shadowy (14) land.8s The fertilizing power of the wild and the beneficent order of civiliza- tion are thus fused together, and their fusion makes possible the trans- ference to men at Olympia of the symbolic trees that protect from the searing force of nature (24). While the Hyperboreans reflect the communicability of the joy and vitality of nature to men, their land still contains an ambivalent duality like Artemis or the hind: it is cold (32), remote, mysterious, and hard to attain; yet it is also the region where the wild olive grows, where the magical hind takes refuge, and where Artemis receives the hero. Its significance lies between the objective duality of nature, now fruitful, now mysteriously barren, and the total enriching benevolence of the gods -- through the hero - to men. It is associated elsewhere in Pindar</page><page sequence="27">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 237 with the pure, untroubled joy which only those who are very close to gods can attain. In the Tenth Pythian (34-44) especially it is the land of ever-present music, dancing, and festive delight, free from disease, old age, toil, and Nemesis. Apollo rejoices there and "laughs seeing the up- right wantonness (ifptpv pOlcv) of beasts" (36). Nor would a mortal "with ships or going on foot find the wondrous road to the assembly of the Hyperboreans" (29-30); and Perseus attains it only through the special favor and guidance of Athena (45). Thus it is a world beyond mortality, unreachable, perfect, magical, opened only by the benevo- lence of a god. It is associated too with the primal fertility of the earth, for the two Hyperborean maidens on Delos are worshiped as promoters of fertility: they have sacred objects carried in a sheaf of wheat (Herodo- tus 4-33.1, 33-4-5); Delian maidens before marriage cut off a lock of hair, wind it on a spindle, and place it on their grave; and Delian child- ren make a similar offering, winding their hair "about some green shoot'" (rept' XhA-dv -tva, 4-34.2).81 Interesting for the connection with the Third Olympian, too, is that a wild olive tree grows on their grave which lies in a sanctuary of Artemis (Herodotus 4-34.2). They thus bring to the Delians the life-giving fertility from the magic land, as Heracles brings it to men at Olympia, carried in the olive trees. The Hyperboreans are also mythologically relevant because in some versions the hind pursued by Heracles finds refuge with the Hesperidae, who are sometimes localized among the Hyperboreans.82 (Taygeta, too, a daughter of Atlas, would be related to the Hesperidae.) The Hyper- borean land, as a refuge for the pursued hind, would mythologically pre- figure the spirit of reconciliation that takes place in the ode. The accessibility of a region otherwise remote and, even more, the fact that the hero can return from the magical land and persuade the inhabitants to give him the sheltering trees that grow there symbolize the perfect accord between God and man and the possibility of men's sharing, through the act of the hero, in the quasi-divine purity of joy and life possessed by the Hyperboreans. Heracles' journey does not repeat the familiar mythical pattern of the hero reaching a captivating enchanted realm, a potentially sinister land of suspended life from which return is difficult and in which his will, energy, sense of time and life are sapped83 (like the Lotus-eaters or Calypso's or Circe's island for Odysseus). And yet the inaccessibility of the Hyperborean land (P.io.27-30) serves also as a re- minder of the limits of mortality to which Pindar alludes explicitly at the end of the ode (44-45). It thus makes the more salient the act of divine benevolence by which man may enjoy the contact with the life-giving powers of that realm and the enrichment of his enclosed mortality.</page><page sequence="28">238 Charles Paul Segal The victory in the Third Olympian, therefore, opens man's spirit to the ambient beauty of his world. Hence Pindar's stress on growing and blooming (&amp;owrov, 4, q7TE'EVba, i8, qvrEiVcra, 34, 'OaAAEv, 23), his de- scription of the olive crown (13), his emphasis on the beauty of the full moon (i9ff). He thus links the gentle loveliness of nature with the festi- val and the joy of victory, as if such victory brought a richer sense of the natural beauty of the world, sharpening man's senses to the fullness of life around him and bringing him to closer connection with that life. This vitality, beauty, graciousness, are here present as part of the structure of the world, communicated from Zeus to the wandering hero and brought through the Dioscuri and their festival to the "common" (18) race of men; and this communication is more pervasive and com- plex, yet gentler - perhaps then ultimately simpler - than Pelops' direct confrontation of Poseidon in 0.1. At the same time this beauty is soft and tempered. It is the "golden- charioted, month-dividing" full moon with its "whole eye of evening" (19-20) and not the glaring rays of the sun (24) that lights the festival. And this gold is not the elemental metal of 0.1, shining like a blazing fire in the night, but the sensuous embodiment of the mellowed light of the summer moon, enriching the festive beauty of the sacred grove. The co-presence of full, golden moon and shaded sun marks another degree of accord between antithetical powers of nature, male and female, like that of Artemis and Heracles, green olive tree and cold Hyperborean springs. In the Eighth Isthmian, too, at the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the mid-month moon is the symbolical time of mysterious and fruitful contact with the divine beauty and graciousness that bring to men the joy of immortal loves: "And in the month-dividing evenings she would loose the lovely girdle of her maidenhood in submissiveness to the hero" (48-49). Here the sea-goddess, wooed amid strife on Olympus and prophesied the mother of a dangerous offspring (see I.8.36ff), becomes mild and favoring to human life, bringing into it pleasure and brightness under the softer light of the moon.84 The figure of "beautiful-haired Helen" in the opening line of 0.3 invokes this atmosphere of gentle beauty, flowing from the coherence and harmony between divine and human worlds.85 Half-mortal herself, she is called upon with her divine brothers, the Dioscuri, who maintain this harmonious connection both at Olympia and the Theoxenia (35ff). The poem thus begins with the woman who embodies the accessibility of divine beauty to men and the accord between divine and human through which man can receive it. This beauty continues in "the bloom of horses tireless of foot " (3) and all of the glowing language of the proem</page><page sequence="29">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 239 and in the richness of geographical description: the springs of the Ister (I4), the "most sacred banks of the Alpheus" (22), the dell of Cronian Pelops (23), "the ridges and many-bending recesses of Arcadia" (27), "that land beyond Boreas cold with blasts of wind" (31-32). In Pindar's narrative itself this geographical expansiveness is closely linked with the propitiousness of the gods, for it is when coming from those "many-bending recesses of Arcadia" in his remote wanderings that Heracles is received by Artemis (27). Gracious "receiving" by the gods throws open and enhances the beauty of the world, for the grove which is to be embellished with "the beautiful trees" (23) is also "the all-receiving (pandokos) grove of Zeus " (17-18). The theme of a benevo- lent receiving is present from the first line in the epithet "hospitable to strangers," "guest-loving" (philoxenoi) applied to the Dioscuri and is re-echoed in the allusion to Theron's Theoxenia (40) at which the ode was probably intended to be performed. The joyful Theoxenia thus fuses with the Olympian festival; Heracles joins the Dioscuri, "the godlike twin sons of deep-girdled Leda" (34-35, cf. "beautiful-haired Helen " in vs. i); and the mood of kindly reception pervades the poem from beginning to end. The Olympian festival, held amid the shade of trees carried from the remote Hyperborean land, thus celebrates the potential harmony between the wild, but life-charged, vitality of nature and the order of human civilization. In the horns of the hind, as in the "golden- charioted" full moon, the divine gold enters human life not as a dazzling, astral flash, but embodied in the familiar symbol of the life and fertility of the earth. Similarly, at the end of the ode the quotation about gold from the First Olympian is significantly modified. It is called "of possessions the most worthy of reverence" (alcSo&amp;E'oraT~, 42); and the adjective suggests a moral frame of reference comprehensible within the social framework of human life and involving perhaps a simpler, less dangerous "rightness of relation" to the gods than the erotically tinged charis of the First Olympian (75).86 There is still a charis involved in the communication to men of the harmony between divine order and the primal vitality of the wild, but this charis comes in gentler, more intelli- gible ways, slowly and softly, in shade, traveling the lovely landscape of Arcadia with its many hollows, and not descending brilliantly and suddenly from the heavens. In both poems the hero's task consists partly in knowing where to stop, knowing what are his limitations and where "the beyond" begins (0.1.114; 0.3.44). In the Third Olympian, however, the warning is not so sharp nor so direct, being a simple third-person statement, "The</page><page sequence="30">240 Charles Paul Segal beyond is impassable for wise and unwise" (0.3.44-45), and Pindar simply denies flatly any intent of going " beyond ": " I will not pursue it. I would be empty (of wit)" (0.3.45). In O.I, however, there is a sudden direct imperative: "Look no longer beyond" (114). In the Third Olympian too the risk in general is less, since fulfillment comes through the acceptance of what is given within the limits of mortality, whereas in the First Olympian to reach any significant or lasting attainment the man-hero must push beyond the mortal world, and its darkness, invol- ving himself in the consequent danger of pushing too far or being blinded by the newness and radiance of what he finds. In the Third Olympian it is the benevolence of the ritual which assures to men the fertilizing and revitalizing contact with the divine. Pindar emphasizes the sacredness and ritual purity attached to the Olympian festival in describing "the altars consecrated to his (Heracles') father," Zeus (19), in calling the contest "a sacred trial" (&amp;yvv&amp;v KptlaLv, 21)87 and naming the banks of the Alpheus "most holy" (aoE'oLt, 22). The Olympian festival is here not primarily a time for contests of strength, but a point when the fertile powers of nature are conveyed to men through the gods, and simultaneously a time when the harsher aspect of these powers - and, by extension, of the gods themselves - are "shaded." In emphasizing the sacredness of the festival, Pindar stresses also the importance of the point of transference, the juncture of divine and human worlds. The channeling of divine graciousness to men through a festal or ritual occasion also underlies, of course, the theme of the Theoxenia, which Pindar has closely intertwined with the Olympian festival,88ss in part by having Heracles give the supervision of the games to the Dios- curi, the gods who preside over the Theoxenia at Acragas (39-40).89 The occasion of the banquet (39-40) suggests again the time of fruitfulness and enjoyment of the abundance of nature, a theme analogous then to the planting of olive trees, but with a local significance (the renewal of the life and vitality of the community through a common meal)90 which complements the more general, "cosmopolitan" (see pandokos, 17) extensions of the Olympian festival and its myth. The banquet is con- ducted, moreover, with the proper moral disposition, the "reverent in- tent" (Ei3 YVCr0EE 4,?vL, 41) of the Emmenidae, in marked contrast with the sinister tensions of the banquet of gods and men in the First Olym- pian (36-58). The poet, too, in the Third Olympian, shares in this benign coherence of the world which leads him to celebrate both the victory and the festal banquet (38ff). It is the poem itself which makes present and visible,</page><page sequence="31">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 241 which embodies and preserves for the future, the coherence of the world and the good will of the gods. Thus the first four lines, wherein the poet in the first person calls upon the Dioscuri and Helen, link the Theo- xenia (vs. i) with the Olympic victory (3), suggest the benevolent connection between God and man in the epithet philoxenoi (I), glorify Acragas with an implicit prayer for the life of the community (I-2), sing of the heroic achievement of victory (" horses tireless of foot," 3-4), and express generally the joy in the beauty that flows from this harmony and is present partly in the figure of "lovely-haired Helen" in the first line and partly in adjectives describing the poem itself, like vEocTyaAov (4), ayAa0aKw[Lov (6), TroLKLAh apvv (8). The perception and communication of this coherence constitute an act of joy and beauty precisely because it is a source of immense vitality, as at the festival itself the fertile power of nature passes from the sacred olive trees to the victor's olive wreath (12-13).91 The Muse standing beside the poet at the beginning (4) is the initial sign, for him as poet, of the graciousness of the divine order and the openness of the beauty of the world, analogous on its own level to Artemis' receiving of Heracles and the presence of the Dioscuri and Heracles (34-35, 39-40) at the local Theoxenia. The perception of this order and participation in its festal expression make the songs themselves "destined by God" (OEdELopot, Io) and create in the poet a positive obligation to sing of them: "... Crowns yoked to the hair (of the victor) exact from me this God-made debt (of song)" (ToD70o OEdSLalov X 'os, 7). His "obligation" (chreos) derives from his closer connection with the gods and his greater sensitivity to the beauty of their manifestations and presences in the world. Hence this "obligation" is like the "necessity" of Heracles, emanating from a closeness of connection with the divine; but it is self-directing and free too, since it also derives from a greater receptivity to the beauty and vital energies of the world (like Heracles' wonder at the trees) and a greater will to convey them to men. The benevolent intent of the hero thus becomes analogous to that of the poet also, and Pindar reinforces this connection by using similar phrases to describe the impulse of Heracles to bring back the trees (OvyI8 c5ptLa, 25) and the poet's desire to honor the Emmenidae and Theron at the Theoxenia (Ovtks drpt'vIt, 38). Both by their activity fertilize and revitalize the specific community involved (Olympia and Acragas) and hence symbolically the whole world of men; and both in so doing realize in some part the divinely ordered coherence of the world. Because of their connection with this order, moreover, both hero and poet have the right to speak to men and advise them about their</page><page sequence="32">242 Charles Paul Segal relationship to it. Thus, just as the hero establishes the ritual norms for the festival, giving commands for the honoring of victors (11-13) and entrusting the supervision to the Dioscuri (36-38), so the poet helps in giving moral norms to men; and it is on the basis of his sense of the harmonious beauty of the world, of the positive as well as the negative aspects of man's position in it, that he can warn about "the beyond" and refuse to "pursue it" (44-45)- In his knowledge of the limitations of human achievement he is like the hero, who similarly knows the boundary between mortal and divine. Hence at the conclusion of the poem, in stating that Theron has reached the pillars of Heracles, he suggests that Heracles knew where to stop, knew his fullest limit of success, and so should Theron if he follows the poet's counsels.92 The continuation in the first person (45), however, suggests that Pindar is himself assuming the choice about proceeding further and the moral responsibility of the victor. As in the First Olympian, the poet associates himself with the risk of the victor; but here the risk is minimal, and the poet's concluding utterance is not entirely a negative warning, but a gentler attempt to turn man back into the positive life of the world. The poet does not encounter here the false mythoi of the First Olympian or face the danger of choosing and sustaining truth against falsehood. His task, rather, like that of the hero in the ode, is to communicate to men the beauty accessible to them in the world; and his advice at the end, though it has the moral function of restraining the victor within his proper limitations,93 serves also the more positive purpose of sheltering man from "the beyond," as Heracles shelters the Olympian grove from the sun. The poem expresses this coherent harmony, moreover, in its own structure, in the conscious linking of the mythical event and the institu- tion of the Olympian festival itself with Theron's present victory and the celebration in Acragas, a linking which makes the present joy derive from the hero's primal act of benevolence and from the benignity of the gods to him. The sanction for the order and beauty of the world moves back gradually from the present situation to the mythic and symbolical realm and fuses with it. Thus the presence of the Muse beside the poet on the single occasion (frcfp'or-a 4, aorist of single occurrence) is but one illustrative instance of the potential relationship of favor and beauty that can exist between God and man. This song for the present victory leads soon to the more general "God-destined songs which come to men" from Pisa (Io), just as the crowns on the head of Theron (6) lead soon to the act of crowning that has occurred and will continue to occur at the festival from its foundation (IIff, where 0 rtvt emphasizes the</page><page sequence="33">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 243 generic significance). This long tradition of crowning leads back, in turn, to the origin of the ritual in the past (cf. rpo-e'pas, II), the mytho- logical event which brought life and shade to Olympia. Gradually, too, as the narrative unfolds and the imagery develops, the elements in the mythological event begin to take on a symbolical significance: the "shade" of the Ister's springs and the beauty of the olive trees (13-14) assume a deeper meaning in the "shady plant" which protects the Olympian grove from sun (24); and at the same time the olive branch as "a common crown of excellences for men" (I8) extends this symbolic- ally life-giving significance of the tree to the present victory-crown of Theron (6) and to the ever-repeated crowning of the victor by the Olympian judges (I I-I3). Heracles' entrusting of the Olympian festival to the Dioscuri (36) becomes the symbolic transfer of this benign vitality from the mythical world to the human world, on both the individual and generic levels (the present celebration of Theron and the recurrent Olympian festivals respectively). Thus when the festal situation de- scribed at the beginning of the ode and especially before the myth (I9- 22) returns at Theron's Theoxenia, it is with a new and broader sense of the beauty of the world and the favor of the gods, made closer and more accessible to men through the symbolical significance of the hero's journey, reception, and planting of trees.94 Pindar makes this connection between myth and reality more explicit still at the junction of the myth and the concluding festive scene (34ff). Here he welds the two parts closely together, bringing the past up into the present with the vivid words " And now into this festival he (Heracles) comes propitiously" (34); he uses the same word for this "coming" of Heracles (vIoErat, 34) that he used earlier of the songs coming from Pisa (io); and, as noted above, he suggests an association between his own impulses in singing the ode (38) and those of the hero in transplant- ing the trees (25). The factual reality of the present is thus united with the mythological past. The single instance becomes permeated by and almost interchangeable with the timeless symbolical significance of the mythical deed to such an extent that the various strands cannot be separated without destroying the poem. The symbolical significance of the olive crown, the victory, the festal banquet, as they fuse with the en- framing myth-the transplanting of the trees, the pursuit of the golden- horned hind to the Hyperborean land, the reception by Artemis, the consecration of the altars to Zeus at the full moon-gives the poem its sensuous imagistic unity and states the possibility of making receivable and tangible what was hitherto remote and unformed. The communication of this beauty to men is the task of the poet as</page><page sequence="34">244 Charles Paul Segal well as of the hero. The deed of victory celebrated by the poet is not an isolated act, but set in a ritual context as a point of potential contact with the beauty and benignity of the divine order. It is for this reason that the poet feels his victory-song as a "God-made debt" (7). It has already been seen how at each point in the ode the active impli- cations of the victory are softened by juxtaposition with the ritual circumstance and through that with the broader vitalizing beauty of nature. This balancing appears, for example, in the victory-crown and the olive-branch (I1-13, 18-20); the beauty of the grove at full moon and the "pure trial of great contests" (19-24); the Dioscuri's double connection with the supervision of the games and the propitious cele- bration of the Theoxenia (37-4I).95 In the larger structure of the ode, too, there is an alternation of pure narrative with festive moments of ritual. The poem presents the following pattern: 9-I3b festival at Olympia - 14-18 narrative of Heracles' founding - 19-23 the first Olympic festival - 23-34 the central narrative (the myth of the hind and Hyperborean journey) - 34-4 i the festival ("opr cv, 34) of the Theoxenia - possibly further restless wandering and movement in the concluding allusion to the "pillars of Heracles" (43-45). This structural balance of tale and festival not only encloses each part of the action in a ritual cele- bration, but creates also an alternation of kinetic and static, movement and rest, that brings each part of the action to a gradual completeness at a point of fruitful and beneficent contact between man and God. 96 The gradual passage back from the present, festive moment to the heroic, mythical act only expands the fullness of success and enriches the favor- ing context of the victory, whereas in the First Olympian the movement backward in time and the association of the victor (or the poet) with the hero of the myth bring sinister overtones and suggestions of danger. The harmonious coherence of the world in the Third Olympian, the unity between the heroic-mythological, generic-ritual, and present- individual elements is reinforced by the circularity and lucidity of the form. The ode begins with the theme of philoxenia and the invocation to the Dioscuri (i), and ends with their presence at Theron's Theo- xenia (34-41). The planting of the Hyperborean trees surrounds the action of the myth (13-16, 31-34), enclosing it in a framework of verd- ant fertility and thus underlining the fusion of gentleness and force con- veyed in the imagery and the myth itself. The joy of victory and sense of the favoring connection between man and God pass from the moment of the present festival in the first strophic system to the mythical estab- lishment of that festival by Heracles in the second, and back to a present festival, the Theoxenia, in the third. This third festival, the</page><page sequence="35">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 245 sharing of a banquet with gods who in their philoxenia wish mortals well, thus subsumes with even greater confidence and tangible immedi- acy the joy of contact between man and God in the first two ritual instances. The poem is articulated, moreover, in terms of journeys: the songs coming from Pisa (Io), presumably to Theron at Acragas, Heracles traveling from Olympia to the Hyperboreans (25) and his wanderings through Arcadia (27), his coming with the Dioscuri to the Theoxenia at Acragas (34), the coming of the Dioscuri themselves on many occasions to the Theoxenia (40), and finally the concluding statement that Theron has reached the pillars of Heracles (43-45) beyond which is "impass- able." These journeys help clarify the movements back and forth between present reality, mythological past, and continuous ritual. The journey too is a significant means of unifying narration, for it implies an expansive contact with the world (especially in the journeys through Arcadia to the Ister and Hyperboreans, 14, 27, 31-32)97 and is also a mode of acting in the world without violating it, a form of contact with its beauty without disturbing any of its elements. As the major form of action here, the journey is typical of the greater quietness and gentleness of narrative, as compared with the First Olympian; and it permits the elimination of death from the hunt and hence from the whole poem. Pindar ends the ode also with the image of a wandering, but this time a dangerous one, no longer in the fixed limits of the world, but into the "beyond" which is "impassable (abaton) for wise and unwise." He introduces here another journey of Heracles, dangerous like that to the Hyperboreans, but also stopped within the limits of possibility. In thus halting at a supreme point of attainment, but still within the realm of what may be fittingly attained, he re-establishes in a more secure con- text the elemental superlatives, water and gold, which he has deliber- ately recalled here (42) from the recent First Olympian. At the same time, as noted above, he gives gold the morally qualifying and humaniz- ing modifier "most to be revered" (aidoiestatos, 42). Pindar suggests, therefore, that in the more open world presented in the Third Olympian the victor may go to the extreme of success (po &amp; ErX-mrL&amp;v, 43), but without the proximity of the potentially hostile forces of the First Olympian. In both odes, nevertheless, man's achievement and vitality spring from contact with mysterious, sometimes dangerous, divinities and powers; the sources of his most intense energies and his fullest grasping of the world lie in remote and inaccessible places, to be sought in darkness</page><page sequence="36">246 Charles Paul Segal and danger or by a difficult journey. Thus in the Third Olympian there are still potentially dangerous primal energies contained in the cold Hyperborean land, the northern Artemis, the golden-horned hind, the searing rays of the sun, the "necessity" from Zeus; but their des- tructive violence is tempered and incorporated into human civilization through the God-sanctioned, hero-established ritual. The imagery of the ode, too, fuses Pindar's conventional images - gold, the sun, the " bloom " of the richness of attainment - with deep primeval symbols of the life-charged energies of nature: horns, the hind, trees. Human life exists, then, in a place of shelter between the fruitfulness and the wildness of nature, between the valley of Olympia, no longer exposed and treeless, and the mysterious recesses and ridges of Arcadia; the Hyperborean land exists too, but beyond man's ordinary scope. Through the hero's intervention, however, men can touch and tap the life-giving current of nature's vitality without exposure to its destructive powers. The man-hero of the First Olympian lacks this intervention: he must face the divine in solitude and undergo the risk of annihilation. The desire which snatches him up is sudden and powerful, and it acts with violence (cpmr'ucraL, 40), with little of the " sweetness " of desire with which Heracles admires the northern trees (0.3-33). Tantalus' banquet is not a simple, joyous communication with divine vitality, like Theron's Theoxenia, but a time of tension, with evil myths of cannibalism in the background and perhaps, in the untold legend of the Pelopids Atreus and Thyestes, dimly in the future. The gods of the First Olympian are not actually hostile, but embody an objective moral order which maintains the boundary between mortal and divine. The gods' dismissal of Pelops is not necessarily an act of anger or cruelty, but simply a necessary expulsion from their realm of an imperfect, or of a less perfect, being; yet for the hero this resumption of mortality has tragic overtones. Both man and hero in the Third Olympian, however, by the acceptance of the world and by the absence of a self-assertion apart from the mortal rhythms of life, can invite the beneficent help of the gods without risk. Effort is still required, but it is an effort of expansiveness and receptivity to beauty, not the intense, agonized concentration of Pelops. The contests of 0.3 thus lose some of their crucial importance as a means to attaining the brightness of beauty and overcoming mortality. They are seen, rather, as the adornment of the already established and ritually celebrated beauty of the world. In this open, accepted world it is possible to make the journey to the Hy- perboreans and return, to touch the magical springs of life (now "shaded," 14) without disaster, to hunt the hind without violating the</page><page sequence="37">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 247 realm of the goddess. The hero can come to know the full beauty of the world without losing his "innocence," without involving himself in death by killing the hind. Thus, in one sense, the Third Olympian represents the stage of Pelops and Tantalus before their "fall," while they still enjoy the unmarred fullness of their olbos in easy contact with the gods and untroubled by mortality. In another sense, the Third Olympian begins at the point where the First ends, the enclosure of man's relation to the vitality of the world in a protective ritual which channels the divine brilliance into humanly receivable form. The gods do not actively seek to aid mortals, nor do they act out of any sense of selfless, overflowing love (Poseidon's eros in 0.1 is far from being that, though Pindar may have been no less serious about its sym- bolical significance than Plato about the final eros of the Symposium or Phaedrus). Pindar's gods in both the odes retain something of the mys- tery and ambiguity of elemental powers. Yet at the same time they are the moral governors of the universe and the givers of all fulfillment of action, praxis (0.1i.8) or telos, for men.98 They give this telos when it is in accordance with the moral order which they maintain. They foster and sustain whatever is in accordance with that order and chastize what is not. Hence the antithesis of the First Pythian: the beauty of the lyre and softness of the eagle on the side of order and beauty, Apollo and the Muses (1-2); the roaring explosions and blazing lava-streams of Aetna for "all that Zeus loves not" (I3ff). The First Olympian presents men in a universe where there is a con- tinual straining tension between these two aspects of reality, between the right receiving and understanding of the world's beauty, and false- hood about the gods, between charis and ate, Pelops and Tantalus. To speak ill of the gods is not only to invite punishment, but is a total mis- understanding of the potentials of the world, a blasphemy against its moral order, and a denial of the possibility of beauty, achievement, deep and lasting joy--of any of the goods of which the gods give the telos. Hence it is oKE'p8SEL (0.1.53), " profitlessness," a word Pindar uses only here, a foredooming of the ability of human life to reach and create beauty by contact with the charis from the gods. This charis is itself the sign of the gods' presence in the world and the source of its beauty. Thus blasphemy of the gods involves one of the most limiting of human weak- nesses, envy (phthonos, 0.1 .47). Yet the gods are initially well-disposed to mortals, or at least certain mortals of exceptional gifts, as is exemplified in their honoring (dr'AaGuv, 55) of Tantalus, a particular instance of the honor (tima, 31) which charis in general brings. Although the easier accessibility of beauty in 0.3 appears as part of a</page><page sequence="38">248 Charles Paul Segal greater divine benevolence, actually the quality of the divine remains constant, and it is the difficulty of men which is lessened. The resolu- tion of tensions in 0.3 merely makes more apparent the potential graciousness of the gods, present equally, nevertheless, in the honoring of Tantalus in the First Olympian. To be able to see the gods rightly is to know the fullness of this beauty, though it is also to know the limita- tions of human life, the remoteness of the Hyperborean land and all that lies beyond the pillars of Heracles. Both odes are then concerned with "the beyond" for men and with the balance between justified aspirations that may rightly expand human life and the presumptuous infringement of mortal limitation and the order of the cosmos. The Third Olympian develops the positive side: the "extreme" (43) may be reached without danger. Hence its tone and imagery are sensuous and rooted in the primal symbols of the vitality of the earth. The First Olympian develops the negative side of the human position in the world: the inaccessibility of the elemental and eternal powers of water, fire, sun, the divine. Its levels of subterranean imagery are not the primordial, life-filled powers of the natural world, but the perhaps equally primeval, yet more sinister themes of dismem- berment, cannibalism, dark and mysterious initiation ceremonies. When man is reborn it is from darkness and suffering into a dangerous world of brazen spears and swift chariots where death is the penalty of the loser. In the Third Olympian the symbol of the victory is unambiguously the symbol of life, the olive tree, whereas even the festivity of Pelops' marriage is darkened by the pressing knowledge of death. The First Olympian, with its strident immediacy of the need for achievement, its uncompromising disparity between God and man, is a darker picture, framing human life between the glaring sun in an empty sky and the in- different "hoary" sea, and presenting without mitigation the precipi- tous finitude of mortality and the intense reality of the danger of death and old age "shareless in all beautiful things." It is complemented by the vitality and expansive beauty of the world in the Third Olympian, where the hero's action, sanctioned in turn by the divine benevolence, opens for men a gentler receptiveness to this beauty. When the world is not always so open, however, man confronts, like Pelops, the necessity of his mortality and the task of undertaking the lonely, dangerous quest for meaning and beauty. The two odes thus reflect separate, but closely complementary sides of Pindar's genius: a deeply feeling awareness of human struggling and limitation in the face of death, and a rich sensitivity to the beauty of the</page><page sequence="39">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 249 world. The gentleness of the Third Olympian is, perhaps, explicable in part by the long and amicable relations of Pindar with the Emmenidae of Acragas, dating from his earliest poems, P.I2 and P.6.99 In the Sec- ond Olympian, written probably shortly after the Third and for the same victory, this gentleness deepens into a profound solace where sensuous beauty and the poignancy of death combine in the transcen- dental vision of the after-life (6I-8o). Pindar had also written a poem of solace for Hieron, the Third Pythian, perhaps a few years after 0.2 and 0.3,100 but it, too, like the First Olympian, is concerned with deception, ate (24), the dangerous purity of the god (see a7Trpta OEo00 KaOapov, 15) and lacks the gentleness and free, receptive openness to natural beauty of the Third, and the Second, Olympian. III The Third Olympian is, in addition to its own clear beauty, of import- ance also for what it adumbrates for the future in Pindar's work. In the great odes of the 460's - Olympians 6, 9, 13, 710 - he is to achieve a high poetic fusion of the sensuous expansiveness of the Third Olympian with the probing moral force of the First. The established harmonious moral order of the gods, so powerfully and vividly asserted in the great Pythian odes of the 47o's - P.1, 2, 3, 9 - makes possible, as it were, the confidence in the beauty and richness of the world in these poems and the broadening of geographical horizons, the enlarging of the whole narrative scale in the epic-proportioned Fourth Pythian (462 B.C.).102 In these odes, too, the gods foster whatever is beautiful and civilized in human life, and their presence illumines the world with color and beauty. So in the story of lamus in 0.6 - the son of "the golden-haired one," Apollo (41), grandson of Poseidon and "violet-haired " Euadna - born amid crimson, silver, and "the yellow and purple beams of vio- lets " (30-40, 55). Here too the link between man and God is, as in the First Olympian, an erotic connection, but with far less sinister implica- tions and a gentler, more beneficent interplay of light and dark through- out the ode. Iamus, too, prays in the night "in the middle of the Alpheus" to Poseidon and Apollo (57ff); but his prayer, following directly his rich-omened birth, is more confident of his future attain- ment and of his closeness to the gods.x03 It is short and answered directly by the god: "Rise up, my son, to go hither to the place common to all, behind my voice" (62-63). Pindar then dwells on the fulfillment of the prayer, not the tensions of the hero's danger and mortality, as in 0.1. Iamus invokes, moreover, not only the "heavy-rumbling god of the</page><page sequence="40">250 Charles Paul Segal strong trident" (0.1.72-73) to be met alone in the night, but simultane- ously (59) calls upon "the bow-bearing guardian of God-built Delos," his father, Apollo. The combination is perhaps significant, for Poseidon, though benevolent, often gives his aid after suffering, as in the "calm out of storm" of 1.7 (37ff) or, indeed, the two anchors that are "good to hang out in a stormy night" at the end of this ode, whereas Pindar's Apollo is usually closer and more unambiguously propitious.104 It is thus significantly "the paternal voice," Apollo's, which answers him (62). Iamus, like Pelops, also calls upon the gods "when he received the sweet-joyed fruit of golden-crowned Hebe" (57-58); but here the gold of success, not the shadowing down and uncertainty of Pelops, is already upon him; and the bloom of his youth only intensifies the sensuous richness and the polychromatic luxuriance of the rest of the ode. In these poems the gods become not only the source of the radiant beauty of the world, but the bestowers of a direct benevolence, the beings who protect and promote life. This concept is incipient in Heracles' blessing of Telamon's future son in 1.6 and, as shown above, is the central theme of the Third Olympian. The gods now, however, no longer designate such action to the hero, but take it upon themselves: Zeus saves Deucalion and Pyrrha, and thus the whole human race, by drawing off the flood in 0.9 ;10 Athena helps Bellerophon with the "mild drug" in 0.13; she bestows the gift of the arts upon the Rhodi- ans in 0.7 even though they forgot the fire for their sacrifice.106 This development is most fully foreshadowed in Heracles' fertilizing act in the Third Olympian. The theme of the fertility of nature and the am- bivalence of its power appears in the prayer to the sun after an eclipse in Paean 9 (frag. 44 Bowra);l10 and the rhythm of alternating fertility and barrenness becomes in two of the later poems (N.6.9, N.II.39) part of a deeper perception of the place of human life and suffering in the organic pattern of nature.108 The theme of the hero fostering and fertilizing human life has its deepened counterpart too, fused with the poignant recognition of the pain of mortality and separation, in the Tenth Nemean where the god-hero, Polydeuces, relinquishes a part of his immortality on behalf of his dying brother; the god (or demigod) now takes upon himself a share in human death.109 None of these themes can or should necessarily be traced back directly to the Third Olympian; but that ode, with its redefinition of the hero's act in terms of promoting life and tempering the harshness of the natural world for men, and with its freer openness to the beauty of the world, gives some indication of the organic growth of Pindar's sensitivity. His gods and heroes come to act</page><page sequence="41">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 251 less by violence and physical strength and more in accordance with a fuller and gentler knowledge of human suffering. Olympians I and 3 together combine in complementary fashion themes later to be fused and deepened but representing a basic recur- rent polarity in Pindar's perception of the world: the awareness of the fullness of life in the latter poem and of the dark reality and pressing immediacy of death in the former. Though Pindar's poetic expression undergoes a sensuous expansion in the 460's, he does not let his height- ened responsiveness to the sensuous beauty of the world blunt or obscure his knowledge of the pain involved in the human situation. Nor, on the other hand, in his latest poems, do the pain of disappointment and the acceptance of mortality destroy the sense of the beauty of life and the possibility of joy, ephemeral though it may be (1.7.40). The two sides, life and death, joy and suffering, are always present in Pindar, in varying proportions, from the contrast of the aglaia of the young victor with the "black-walled house of Persephone" where his dead father dwells in the early O.I4110 to the alternation of darkness and color in 0.6 or the juxtaposition of mortal ephemerality, man as "a shadow's dream," with "the Zeus-given radiance" in P.8 (95-97). As with the blooming youth of Pelops at the moment of his trial with death, the awareness of pain and mortality intensifies the sense of the richness and possibility of life, and vice versa. By the later N.8 this interaction of beauty and suffering is both more somber and more profound: that a poem gripped by the bitterness of strife, disappointment, betrayal, and death in the myth of Ajax (22-34) can be illuminated by the invocation to " Lady Hora, messenger of the ambrosial endearments of Aphrodite " and the lovely image of the dew-freshened vine reaching "toward the liquid air" (38-42) bespeaks a mastered sense of the tragedy and joy of life. In the late poems, generally, this balance is finer and the knowledge of the two sides is more complex, more deeply felt, and more closely centered upon basic human relationships and needs; "the simple roads of life,""111 the "uses of friends," the joy of trust, in the Eighth Nemean (35-36, 42-44), the ties of fraternal love in the Tenth: "Honor flees for a man bereft of friends; but there are few men of trust for mortals amid toil to take a share in suffering" (N. 10.78-79). The beauty which in the Third Olympian was found in the expanding world of nature and in the First in the dangerous but radiant contact with the divine is now found in trust and the sharing of suffering between man and man.112 Here the pain and mortality become an essential part of the "joy," the terpsis which is possible for man (see N.8.43), and this "joy," in turn, is not destroyed by the pain, the penthos of N. io (77) and 1.7 (37), but renders</page><page sequence="42">252 Charles Paul Segal the suffering and the loss themselves beautiful instead of harsh. The ability of man to hold within himself the balance between joy and loss brings a deeper, transfiguring beauty that stands above the transience of mortal pleasure and pain. It is a beauty of fullness rather than resigna- tion, of patiently won understanding and cherishing of all that human life can hold rather than a force and bitter dismissal of it. It is reflected well by the personal lines in the Seventh Isthmian, written when the poet had reached perhaps his sixty-fifth year. Pindar speaks here of a kinsman of the victor killed in war, "breathing out his well-flowering time of life," and then turns to himself: I suffered grief not to be told; but now the Earth-shaker granted to me calm weather out of storm. I shall sing, fitting my hair with crowns. But let not the envy of the immortals disturb whatever ephemeral joy pursuing I proceed into old age and the fated time of life. For we die all alike; but (only) the daimon (of our luck) is unequal ... (37-43) 113 The juxtaposition of victory and old age, of life and death, of God and man, is no longer so discordant and threatening as in the First Olympian, but is part of a tranquil and gentle fulfillment of man in his human situation, knowing the rootedness of his life in change, and accepting its passing away, "calm" as his life proceeds to its "fated time," and thus now beautiful himself in and through his mortality. NOTES I wish to acknowledge my gratitude and indebtedness to Professor John H. Finley of Harvard University, whose teaching and writing have shown me much in Pindar. I. On the dating of 0.I and 0.3 see L. R. Farnell, The Works of Pindar (London 1930-32) II 3-4, 12, 24 (to be cited henceforth simply as " Farnell"). Citations, line, and fragment numbers conform to the Oxford Text of C. M. Bowra, Pindari Carmina, ed. 2 (Oxford 1937). Scholia are cited according to A. B. Drachmann, Scholia Vetera in Pindari Carmina (Leipzig 1903-27). 2. Farnell ad loc. (II 29) cites two further examples of Pindar's quoting himself (0.8.66 and P.8.8I; N.6.9 and N.II.39) but in neither of these cases is the connection so clear and immediate as in the First and Third Olympians. The two odes have been coupled also in a work inaccessible to me: Hugo Jurenka, Pindars erste und dritte olympische Ode (Vienna 1894), but apparently primarily for textual criticism, so far as can be judged from the discussion by Bornemann in Bursian's Jahresbericht 92 (1897) 222-24. 3. See generally John H. Finley, Jr., Pindar and Aeschylus, Martin Classical</page><page sequence="43">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 253 Lectures XIV (Cambridge, Mass. 1955) 175: ". . . The common trait of the odes is the effort to grasp the bright chain that binds men to gods or, better, the radiance that descends from gods to men, touching events with the divine completeness." 4. Judgments as to the poetic worth of O.I have varied. Farnell, while qualifying Lucian's praise of it as " the most beautiful of all lyrics," still admitted it to the rank of "one of the masterpieces of ancient song" (I 9, see I 7). Wila- mowitz, on the other hand, declared "dass O.1, von dem unvergesslichen Eingang abgesehen, zwar fUr seine Sinnesart und die Auffassung seines Berufes ilberaus wichtig ist, aber als Poesie im Ganzen nicht in die erste Reihe seiner Lieder geh6rt "; Pindaros (Berlin 1922) 237. A recent critic has, unjustly, I think, put a low estimate generally on Pindar's poetic greatness, finding " a lack of com- plete communication": H. Musurillo, Symbol and Myth in Ancient Poetry (New York 1961) 57-58. 5. See the scholion ad loc. (181, Drachmann I 56 ): " The final achievement and fullness (- 6TEAEVTa1UOVK Ka 7d 7TwApES), which there is no exceeding for men to find, is raised on high (oioovraL) and exists for kings." See also F. Mezger, Pindars Siegeslieder (Leipzig i88o) 98: " Mit dem Preis des ariston hat es (O.1) begonnen, mit dem Lob des eschaton schliesst es." 6. To speak of "the divine" in Pindar is, of course, to introduce a concept which he did not have, for his poems live in a world of theoi rather than to theion: see G. F. Else, "God and Gods in Early Greek Thought," TAPA 80 (1949) 24-36. For his use of theos (more pantheistic than monotheistic) see Farnell's "Excursus on Pindar's Religion," II 464, 466. 7. For the acceptance of danger (kindynos) as necessary for the heroic achievement in Pindar see 0.6.9.-11: "Honorless are excellences without risk (akindynoi aretai) either among men (i.e., on land) or in hollow ships"; so also in P.4.185-86 Hera inspires in the heroes a longing for the Argo so that "none, left behind, might remain by his mother coddling his dangerless span of life." See also P.4.207, 0.5.I6-17. 8. The passage about Ganymede (0.1.44-5) provides clear evidence about Pindar's attitude to the love affair. As shocked commentators have noted, Pin- dar does not even question its morality, and in the framework of the poem this eros is of a strong positive value. See Farnell, I 8-9: " Nor does Pindar's attempt in this poem to reform the religious mythology of his people strike the modern reader as happy: in his eagerness to clear the Gods from the imputation of cannibalism, he invents a myth still more repulsive to our taste." In the same vein is Wilamowitz' comment (above, n.4) 236; after alluding to the Boeotian attitude toward homosexual love in Plato's Symposium (i82b) he continues: "Dass Pindar die G6tter mit einer solchen Erfindung entlasten will, beleuchtet wohl am grellsten die Wahrheit, dass die frommste Gesinnung und das strengste Gefiihl fUr die Reinheit des Gottesbegriffes und der Sittlichkeit mit einer Ansicht fiber das was sittlich und schicklich ist verbunden sein kann, die andere Denkart und Sitte schaudern macht." 9. Thus Finley (above, n.3) 35 speaks of the symbolic connection of the gods with any brilliant success; and it is especially at the moment of victory when man and god meet, "when the gods' timelessness touches time and change" (40). Io. According to the scholion ad loc. (Drachmann I 48) haimakouriai is a Boeotian word used of the rituals for the dead. i. For the importance of aglaia in Pindar see G. Norwood, Pindar, Sather</page><page sequence="44">254 Charles Paul Segal Classical Lectures XIX (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1945) 67, who describes it as "'radiance' - almost what we mean by 'halo'." 12. For Pindar's association of gold with the radiance cast on human life by the gods, see Finley (above, n.3) passim, esp. 53 with reference to 0.1: ". .. The glint of gold characteristically marks for Pindar those moments when the divine transcendence touches this world." I3. It has been maintained with great probability by J. T. Kakridis, "Des Pelops und lamos Gebet bei Pindar," Hermes 63 (1938) 415ff that, contrary to the view of Carl Robert, Pelops' prayer is Pindar's invention, and is a deliberate departure from the existing version of the betrayal of Oenomaus by Myrtilus (first found in Pherecydes, FGrHist 3F 37) and thus a part of Pindar's substi- tution of the love-motif for the earlier myth of the eating of Pelops (see esp. pp. 419-421). Less certain is Kakridis' further suggestion, however (424ff), that the prayer at night represents, perhaps as an unconscious recollection, the working of magic against Oenomaus, the binding of his chariot (see O. 1.76) by a defixio. He notes the parallel with the prayer in 0.6, and suggests that a hint of magic- working is present there too in the motif of the prayer in the middle of the river (0.6.58). 14. Norwood (above, n.II) 92-93 speaks of the recurrent " blend of austerity and loveliness," darkness and light, in Pindar, and remarks on O.I.8Iff: " Heroic action in prospect also, as in the past, gains splendour from the background of dark death" (p. 93). I5. For the comparison with the initiation ceremony, and other Pindaric parallels, see Jacqueline Duchemin, Pindare, poete et prophete (Paris 1955) 172, I88ff. Less happy perhaps is her interpretation of Pelops as a Pythagorean symbol (pp. 160-6I). I6. In the allusion to the myth of Demeter's eating of Pelops' shoulder (Themis in other versions: see the scholia ad loc., 4oa, 40c, 40d, Drachmann I 29-30). The mixture of destruction and restoration is perhaps the more sug- gestive because Demeter is the goddess of fertility, the source of that which is eaten healthfully and wholesomely (unlike Tantalus' feast) and also perhaps because she is connected with the alternating cycle of death and rebirth, grief and joy (as in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter) which is relevant to Pelops' " rebirth" with the ivory shoulder. See Farnell's interpretation (II 6) of lines 26-27 as " referring merely to the purification of the new-born babe in the bath, from which he was received by Klotho as one of the usual birth goddesses: the ivory shoulder is then intended by Pindar as a birth-mark"; but it is perhaps possible to speak also of a figurative "rebirth" from the darkness of his prayer (71) and of the old age which he contemplated (82-84) to the brightness of his fame (kleos) at Olympia (93; see A7TrEL . . . KAEO9, 23) and the aglaia with which his worship is surrounded (91). I7. Finley (above, n.3) 5I speaks of "the main truth of Pelops' life" as the knowledge "that we are ne;ther in a godless world nor can be gods, but occupy a middle ground in which, whatever the rancorous may say or however confusing the present may be, courage can receive that validation by the gods which is success and glory." i8. The number thirteen seems to have been as unlucky for the classical Greeks as for us, occurring with sinister overtones perhaps as early as Homer (e.g. Iliad 5.387, 10.495-6, 56o-61; in Od. 9.195, the fateful landing on the Cyclops' island, Odysseus makes the thirteenth of the party). The thirteenth</page><page sequence="45">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 255 of Gamelion was, according to Argive tradition, the date of Agamemnon's murder (see Jebb on Soph. El. 28off). See A. B. Keith, s.v. " Numbers (Aryan)" in Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (1917) IX 409, 413; H. J. Rose, s.v. "Numbers (Sacred)" in OCD (1949) 614, citing Otto Weinreich, Triskai- dekadische Studien (Giessen 1916). Thirteen seems to have had also a negative significance in the ritual calendar, deriving perhaps from the intercalated month of the lunar year; see A. Bouch6-Leclercq, L'Astrologie grecque (Paris 1899) 460, n.I: "Dans le calendrier ath6nien le 13 6tait un jour de mauvais augure: on n'y rencontre que des c6remonies appartenant aux cultes chthoniens ... La peur du nombre 13 viendrait plut6t du treizieme mois des calendriers lunisolaires, mois vide de fetes religieuses et comme dtlaiss6 par les dieux, abandonn6 par consdquent aux g6nies malfaisants." The choice of 13 suitors may therefore be of significance for Pindar here, for the number does not seem fixed in the tradition. Pausanias 6.2z I.o- 1, citing Hesiod's Megalai Eoiai (frag. 147 Rzach) gives 16 and adds two more from another source; two of the scholia (127b, 127d) give 13, but two other scholia (127c, I27e) give I5 and 6 respec- tively; and the names on the lists themselves are widely divergent (e.g., only eight of the thirteen recorded in schol. z27b appear in Pausanias' list). Pindar may thus deliberately have chosen the number thirteen from a fluid tradition, perhaps following the authority of Hesiod and Epimenides if the scholion (127b, followed by Farnell II 9) is correct, but perhaps influenced also by the sinister associations of the number. I9. For the mound of the suitors and Pelops' sacrifices, see also J. G. Frazer, The Golden Bough, part III, "The Dying God," ed. 3 (London 1911) 104. 20. J. T. Kakridis, "Die Pelopssage bei Pindar," Philologus 85 (1929-30) 475ff rightly sees the "pure caldron" as referring to the older, sinister myth, which Pindar replaces, but does not completely let slip from the audience's memory: "Dann will er diese Liebe des Gottes begriinden, wobei er aber Zilge aus der alten Sage bewahrt .. ." (477). He also construes the ITE1 Of 26 causally so that Poseidon does not fall in love with a new-born babe (see also Wilamo- witz, above, n.4, 234-235). For the double reference of the caldron see also Mezger (above, n.5) 90. 21. For Pelops' birth and false death as suggestive of an initiation ceremony, see Duchemin, above, n.I5. 22. For "doing, suffering, and learning" (" Purpose, Passion, Perception") in the structure of tragedy see Francis Fergusson, The Idea of a Theatre (Prince- ton 1949) passim. 23. Kakridis (above, n.2o) 463ff interestingly demonstrates the importance of the mythical parallel of Ganymede for Pelops in 0.1, showing that Pindar took many elements in the Pelops story from the account of Ganymede in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite 200oo-217. Especially relevant here, however, is the observation that such a removal to the gods usually means immortality (so for Cephalus, Clitus, Tithonus originally, even Odysseus with Calypso, 472); and hence his dismissal back to the mortal world is an irrevocable loss of immortality: "Dass er wieder sterblich werden soll, wird besonders hervorgehoben. Das ewige Himmelsleben ist ihm verschlossen" (473). He cites also the association between Ganymede and immortality in O.o.o104. 24. For the distinction between the worship of gods and that of heroes, see A. D. Nock, "The Cult of Heroes," HThR 37 (1944) 141-73, esp. 148: "When the sacrifice is a holocaust, the victims dark, not light, and the time</page><page sequence="46">256 Charles Paul Segal night rather than day, then the cult in question is usually directed to heroes or to deities of the earth or underworld, but we cannot make even this proposition universal." For the worship of Pelops as a hero see also p. 143, citing Pausanias 5.I3.2-3 ; also the scholion on haimahouriai (90) cited above, n. io, referring to the enagismoi proper to heroes and the dead, for which see Nock, 161-62. Frazer (above, n.19) 1o4 describes the sacrifice of black rams at the cult of Pelops and the young men flagellating themselves " till the blood dripped from their backs on the ground - a sight well-pleasing to the grim bloodthirsty ghost lurking unseen below" -a picture quite different from the aCltpKoUvpltCL &amp;yACaaa of Pelops in Pindar (90-91). 25. B. L. Gildersleeve, Pindar: The Olympian and Pythian Odes, ed. 2 (London 1908) 137, considers 99-Ioo "a bit of cheerful philosophy "; but alE'L rrapdtpEpov, like the &amp;tidpac iidTAomro in 33, has doubtless strong connotations of the changeability and transience of human good fortune, especially as Pindar so uses the closely related EdTd&amp;/XEpOS With great effect in contexts emphasizing human weakness: N.6.6, 1.7.40o, P.8.95 (all, to be sure, later odes); see generally H. Fraenkel, "Ephemeros als Kennwort foir die menschliche Natur," Wege und Formen friihgriechischen Denkens (Munich 1955) 23ff. M1ezger's translation (above, n.5) 95 misses this sense by neglecting the position of aldE and mistrans- lating EPXEraL: " das Glick, welches Tag fiir Tag immer dauert." Farnell (I 6) catches more of the ambiguity: "And the blessing that ever befalleth day by day,/ cometh as the highest bliss for each mortal man." 26. Farnell's translation; commenting on lines 114-115 (II 11) he refers the "Look no longer beyond" to "the world after death" and interprets the oroyov Xpdvov in 1'5 as capable of meaning only " the time of this mortal life," though it might perhaps more easily refer to the immediate joy of the time of the victory and the celebration for which the ode was composed. 27. For the story of Demeter eating the ivory shoulder, see the scholia, ad loc. (4oaff, Drachmann I 30). See also above, n.I6. 28. For the association of charis and the image of sweetness see, e.g., O. 10.93- 94, 97; 1.6-50; 0.14.5-7. This last passage is closely parallel to 0.1.30-31 in its gnomic formulation and the linking of charis with success in action: the Charites are "the stewards of all deeds in heaven" (0.I4.9-10); and further (5-7): "With you are accomplished the pleasant (ta terpna) and the sweet (ta glykea) for mortals, if a man is wise, beautiful, brilliant" (sophos, kalos, aglaos). See also 0.9.28 and 0.6.76 and Farnell ad loc. (II 46): "Here, as often,' charis' personifies for Pindar the joy and brightness of victory in the games." See also Finley (above, n.3) 78-79, 132. 29. There are undoubted verbal parallels in the ode linking Hieron and Pelops (aside from the general similarity of equestrian victories at Olympia), e.g., cf. KparEL 8E 7TpoadEtE E EaT7Odra0v of Hieron (22) with KpDTEL 8S 7rdAaOV and cyAhuatc tLELELKTatL (91) of Pelops; AcdX7TEL 8 ob KAEOS (23) of Hieron with rd ~A KCAOS 0 T-qAdEV 8S0opKe, K./.A. (93-4) of Pelops; yAet~erEat (14) of Hieron with dyAaaucr (91) of Pelops. See also Mezger (above, n.5) 96-97, who, however, somewhat exaggerates the connection. 30. The contingency of the future, in contrast with the vividness of the present (e.g., Iooff of the honoring of Hieron) is emphasized by the optative in xo8, El 84' /7 iraxL A17TOL. 31. There are different interpretations of E'r Xdptwv AAXETL. Farnell (I 5) trans- lates "inure to any gratitude," J. Rumpel, Lexicon Pindaricum (Leipzig 1883)</page><page sequence="47">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 257 s.v. Xad'p (2a) translates charis here by favor, "Gunst," "Gefiilligkeit" (pp. 482-483), and the whole phrase (s.v. r-AA, 2) by gaudio sunt (p. 437). A. Puech, Pindare (Soci&amp;t6 d'1dition "Les Belles Lettres," Paris I922) I 30, trans- lates rather weakly "ont quelque charme." Both interpretations "gratitude" and "joy" for charis are suggested by the scholia, and perhaps Pindar intended both meanings here. 32. For charis as the thrill of beneficent connection with the gods entering and expanding human life, see 1.6.50, ",E^a 8' v30ov vv EKVLEV XdtPS, said of Heracles at the moment when Zeus sends an eagle in confirmation of his prayer for Tela- mon's future son, Ajax. 33. Finley (above, n.3) 50 speaks of the aim of the poet in O.I as being chiefly "to uncover the hidden through inspired insight and to reveal truths which the future will confirm, though they are concealed by the uncertainties of any present as well as by common rancor." 34. See the scholia ad loc., 174a-I74f (Drachmann I 54-55). The first scholion (I74a) refers the expression to Pindar, but indicates its ambiguity in his defense of his interpretation "For it would not be fitting to say concerning the man being hymned, 'If good fortune fails you not,' but it is more tolerable to receive it if we construe it of Pindar." The alternative interpretation, how- ever, referring to the 'rt-po7rog Sattdcov of Hieron (xo6), is explicitly given in schol. 174f. 35. The image of an arrow for poetry occurs frequently in Pindar; see e.g. O.2.83f, 89f, and Mezger (above, n.5) 94, on O.I.112. 36. So Farnell II 6, who continues, ". . . for charis had not much to do with the story of the chopping-up of Pelops." 37. For the chronological relation between Pelops and Ganymede, see Kakridis (above, n.2o) 467ff, who also suggests that Pelops may have served as the gods' cup-bearer on Olympus (pp. 465-66) since Pindar seems to draw upon the Ganymede legend for Pelops too, and hence Pelops' dismissal is corre- lated directly with the mention of Ganymede's coming "for the same task." His hypothesis, though well argued, is not thoroughly convincing; and though the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite may have been in part Pindar's "source" for the account of Pelops on Olympus in 35-45, it does not follow that he intended his audience to think of wine-pouring as the "task" of Pelops and Ganymede. Modern critics (see above, n.8) have tended to deplore or explain away what Pindar explicitly intended (see 25, 41, 75) as an essential element in the poem. 38. The parallel with the Homeric phrase is also noted by Kakridis, Hermes 63.425 (above, n. I3), but he does not pursue the connection further. Pindar uses the phrase iroAta c&amp;Ao'g twice more, in P.2.68 and 1.4.62; see also 0.7.61-62. For sinister associations of rwoAtds- see also P.3.48, of wounds inflicted 7roACi XaAK . 39. Gildersleeve (above, n.25) 135 emphasizes the importance of gamos in 69ff: " Note that this triad is welded together, and moves very fast, with stress on gamon (v. 69, 8o)." 40. The alternation of fortune dominates the myths of the Tantalids, as it does the story of their progenitor. In the only other passage in the Epinikia where Pindar mentions Tantalus, it is also to indicate an alternation of suffering with happiness, of darkness with light. This passage comes in the Eighth Isthmian, written shortly after Plataea, when Pindar's feelings were indeed a mixture of joy and pain: " We shall make public something sweet even after toil, since some god has turned aside from us the stone above the head of Tantalus..." 9 + H.S.C.P.</page><page sequence="48">258 Charles Paul Segal (9-11). The parallel between O.1 and 1.8 has been noted by Josef Mesk, " Tan- talos bei Pindar," Charisteria A. Rzach (Reichenberg 1930) 146, who suggests that the image of 1.8 was in the poet's mind when he composed O.i. 41. For other founding legends of Olympia and associations of the founding with war and strife (including the wrestling of Zeus with Cronos, Pausanias 5.7.10, 8.2.2) see Pausanias 5.7-9, 5.8.3ff, and generally E. N. Gardiner, Olympia (Oxford 1925) 54ff; J. G. Frazer, Pausanias' Description of Greece (London 1898) III 484-485, on 5.-79- 42. Thus Finley (above, n.3) i 19 speaks of Heracles as protecting the human world from the " harsh light " of divinity, and remarks, " As an earthly institution the games are shielded from the glare of full divinity." 43. For Heracles as a divinity of fertility and his connection with the Olympic games, see Gertrude R. Levy, The Gate of Horn (London 1948) 280 with nn.I-2. For the connection of the foundation of the Olympian contests with fertility ritual see also Frazer (above, n.19) 103-105; F. M. Cornford in Jane Harrison, Themis (Cambridge 1912) ch. 7. Also G. R. Levy, "The Oriental Origin of Heracles," JHS 54 (1934) 41-43, who cites an interesting passage from lamblichus, Vit. Pythag. 155, naming "Zeus as the director of nurture, Herakles as the dynamic principle of growth and the Dioskouroi as the har- mony of all the ingredients" (p. 45). This passage not only connects Heracles with growth and fertility, but associates him with the Dioscuri, as, of course, does Pindar in 0.3. Duchemin also (above, n.15) 178 suggests this role of Her- acles in 0.3 as "l'antique genie de la nature" or (with less likelihood) as the Pythagorean symbol of the forces of nature. 44. In the next sentence Pausanias states that Heracles brought the wild olive from the Hyperboreans, but he may not be referring to the same Heracles. See in general L. Weniger, Altgriechischer Baumkultus (" Das Erbe der Alten," N. F. II, Leipzig 1919) 33-34. Farnell, Greek Hero Cults and Ideas of Immor- tality (Oxford 1921) 125ff, doubts that this association of Heracles with the Idaean Dactyls and the Great Mother goes back beyond Onomacritus, the con- temporary of Peisistratus, but these associations would still be present for Pindar in the early fifth century, by which time Heracles certainly had functions associated with fertility: see also pp. 102-103, and his note b, p. 102, qualifying the view of Heracles put forth by Jane Harrison, Themis (preceding note) ch. 9. 45. For Heracles as alexikakos see Farnell, Hero Cults (preceding note) 151; also M. P. Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion (" Handbuch der Alter- tumswissenschaft," ed. 2, Munich 1955) I 544 with n.4.

See Farnell, Hero Cults (above, n.44) 152.

For the association of force and fertility in the ancient Indo-Iranian world, see G. R. Levy, The Sword from the Rock (London 1953) 16, 93, and passim. The book begins from the dagger-god at Yasilikaya who combines the powers of storm god with god of fertility. 50. The alternation of force and fertility is traced in ancient Near Eastern myths by Theodor H. Gaster, Thespis (New York 1950). He points out in the Psalms, for instance, the juxtaposition of prayers to God as a violent storm-god with prayers to a gentle vegetation-god (cf. Ps. 65: 6-9, 10-14; 68: 8-11, and generally pp. 77-78, 90-91, and ch. 5, passim.). In Greek mythology compare, for example, the close succession of the monstrous, reptilian Phorkys and Keto in Hesiod's Theogony (333ff) with rivers of Tethys and Okeanos, who, with children like Peitho, "care for men with Lord Apollo" (347ff). 51. Although, as Farnell noted (II 29, on 0.3-36), the Dioscuri, and especially Castor as a "noted horseman," had an altar at Olympia (Paus. 5.15.5) and "won victories when Heracles instituted the games," "there is nothing to justify Pindar's statement that the Dioskouroi had the supervision of the Olympian festival." 52. For the association of the Dioscuri with horses, see generally Farnell, Hero Cults (above, n.44) 177, 184, 213ff. For the beneficent functions, see his ch. 8, passim. 53. See Mezger (above, n.5) 176 who notes the recurrence of rrnowv in the same place in the strophe in 4 and 34, thus recalling to memory the horses, "als deren herrlichste Frucht im Eingang das olympische Kranzlied bezeichnet worden war." 54. Farnell (II 28) and Gildersleeve (above n.25) 159, however, note some connection between Artemis and horses in P.2.9. Homer (II. 6. 205) calls her Xpvor~vLos (cited by Gildersleeve ad loc. and Mezger, above, n.5, 173). Farnell, however, remarks (II 28) " It is hard to explain why Pindar chooses this epithet ... Her association with horses is very slight"; and he cites his Cults of the Greek States (Oxford 1896) II 450. In a hymn to the Aeginetan Aphaea, how- ever, who has attributes similar to those of Artemis, Pindar sings of "deep- girdled Leto and the driver of swift she-horses'" (frag. 8o Bowra). 55. For Artemis as the protective goddess of wild animals, especially the boar and deer, see Farnell, Cults of the Greek States (above, n.54) II 43Iff, esp. 433. Also Levy, Gate of Horn (above, n.43) 274-75; Nilsson (above, n.45) I 483-86 and passim. For this aspect of Artemis in Pindar, see frag. 61 (Bowra) of the Dithyrambs, on which Duchemin (above, n.I15) 99 remarks, "Plus qu'h la traditionelle Artemis, fille de L6t6 et sceur d'Apollon, nous songerions ici a l'antique divinit6, a la potnia ther6n regnant sur les fauves, que les Cretois ont si souvent represent6e."

Levy, Gate of Horn (above, n.43) 120, and cf. figs. 59-91, p. 118 (and passim) for the tree as the body of the goddess, its fruits her life-giving breasts, like Artemis of Ephesus. According to Nilsson, however, (above, n.45) I 497, there seems to be no trace of the many-breasted Artemis at Ephesus until the fourth century B.c. For the association of Artemis with trees see Farnell, Cults (above, n.54) II 429; Nilsson I 483ff, 492ff. He notes also a tree-cult of Artemis Kedreatis at Caphyae (I 21o). 61. For tree cults in antiquity see ibid. 209-12, and esp. 211-12: "Jedenfalls hat es einen Baumkult in alten Griechenland gegeben; ich m6chte sogar ver- muten, dass es unter der Landbev6lkerung viel allgemeiner und stirker ver- breitet war, als die Zeugnisse uns vermuten lassen." See also generally Weniger (above, n.44). 62. For the association of the tree in Pindar with fertility and life, note his image of the Ev&amp;SpEov otvar in N.8.4off, an ode beginning with an invocation to Hora and full of images of plant growth and fertility (e.g., 7, 9, 17a), in power- ful contrast to the underlying sense of death in the myth (23ff) and the personal prayer (esp. 36, 38). 63. Nilsson (above, n.45) I 2io speaks of the Athenian olive in the Erech- theion as "ein sprechendes Beispiel des Lebensbaumes." It is associated with the life of the community as a sign of the primal gift of civilization by the gods to men: see I 442. For the religious significance of the olive tree generally, see A. S. Pease, "Olbaum," RE 34 (1937) 2020-22. 64. The kotinos (wild olive) and elaia are usually, though not always, dis- tinguished. Pausanias says it was the kotinos which Heracles brought back (5-.7.7), but elsewhere (5.15-3) says that the kotinos from which the crowns came was called the elaia kallistephanos (see also below, n.91). Herodotus (5.82.2) speaks of the jdpzIp-q Aat, as if elaia in itself could mean "wild olive." Still the distinc- tion is fairly well kept, and one would expect Pindar to be conscious of it in a poem where the tree is the central element in the myth. See also references below, n.91. Pease (preceding note) 2019 offers an attractively simple naturalistic explanation for the kallistephanos being sometimes the wild and not the domestic olive: "Wie kam es nun, dass Herakles oder die Eleer aus einem Ableger der elaia einen kotinos Baum heranwachsen sahen ? Sicherlich wegen des Riickschlags der Kulturform gegen die Wildform, sobald man Kerne in die Erde steckt . 65. The importance of the olive tree in the ode is emphasized by Mezger (above, n.5) 176. Gildersleeve (above, n.25) 156, hints at the beneficent associa- tions of the olive tree, but moralizes its meaning too tritely: "The olive was a free gift of God. So is this victory of Theron. It might be dangerous to press the details. Yet it is not unGreek to say that the beauty of life is found of those who walk in the path of duty." 66. It is perhaps noteworthy that Taygeta appears as Artemis' favorite mountain in Callimachus, Hymn 3.188. The Dioscuri are also said to have been born " under the peaks of Taygeta" (Hom. Hymns 17.3, 33.4). 67. Nilsson, Griechische Feste von religilser Bedeutung (90o6; reprint, Darm- stadt 1957) 226-27, referring to the myth of Saron, a hunter who meets such an end: see Pausanias 2.30.7; A. B. Cook, Zeus (Cambridge 1914-25) II., pp. 413- 14; Carl Robert, Die griechische Heldensage in L. Preller, Griechische Mythologie II.2 (Berlin I92I) 451, n.4. 68. On the reconciliation of the hunter in the ode, see Wilamowitz (above, n.4) 239: "Weil eine G6ttin gejagt wird, endet die Jagd in dem G6ttergarten,</page><page sequence="51">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 261 aber immer ist Vers6hnung das Ende: der Held, der es vermocht hat, so weit zu gelangen, findet Aufnahme bei den G6ttern." Hunted stags or hinds, often with emphasis on the horns which bear a cross, appear with a transformed significance in Christian legends of saints. See E. C. Brewer, A Dictionary of Miracles (Philadelphia 1893) s.v. "Stag, hind"; note esp. the stories of Sts. Sorus (p. I28), Felix de Valois (323), Giles (360), Godrich (360), Hubert (282) and Placidus or Eustace (283). Hunting is important in all but the first two of these; and the last two are especially interesting in this con- nection, for the hunted animal, which has led its pursuer apart from his com- panions, turns upon him and converts him, God speaking in and through the animal ("Placidus, why persecutest thou Me?"): a "receiving" of Christ through faith replaces Heracles' reception by the goddess of the wild. 69. On Taygeta see Farnell II 27: "We may at least suppose that Pindar gives us real folklore of Arcadia or Lacedaemon in his narrative about Taiigeta, she is no fictitious 'eponym' of the mountain, but a real personage in an old stratum of local myth . . . and her name is probably that of an old pre-Hellenic divinity, perhaps Artemis or one akin to her." He mentions, too, with reserva- tions, an earlier suggestion of his (see also Robert, above, n.67, 451) that "the mysterious hind might be an animal-form of the goddess herself." This, however, is regarded as dubious by Gruppe, s.v. " Herakles," RE Supplbd. 3 (1918) 1o38. Also in the background may be the transfer of Olympia itself, with its olive trees and oracles, from an aboriginal earth goddess to Zeus, as in the legend of Delphi (see the prologue of Aeschylus' Eumenides). Excavations have con- firmed the literary evidence for an early cult (probably) of Ge or Gaia: see W. DBrpfeld, Alt-Olympia (Berlin 1935) I 29ff, 75, and esp. 64. Weniger (above, n.44) 36ff suggests that Zeus then took over the wild olive previously sacred to Ge. 70. Wilamowitz (above, n.4) 239. 71. For the tradition of Heracles opposing Apollo for the Hind, see A. Furtwiingler s.v. " Herakles" in Roscher, Ausfiihrliches Lexikon der griechischen und r6mischen Mythologie 1.2 (1886-90) col. 2200. 72. This fusion of order and vitality is found too in the Dithyrambic frag- ments (e.g., frags. 61, 63 Bowra), where Pindar could present an orgiastic rite on Olympus (frag. 63). He could feel the full excitement of the ecstatic dithy- ramb (see Archilochus frag. 77D) without jeopardizing his reverence for the order and clarity of the Olympians. See especially Finley (above, n.3) 134ff; he remarks that "Pindar would not have grasped Nietzsche's sharp differentia- tion of Apolline order from Dionysiac excitement . . ." (I34) and that Pindar does not feel a dichotomy "between a purely intelligible order and a purely chaotic vitality," but for him "the world as profusion and vitality is in accord with the world as order" (135). See also Farnell I 328-30 (on frag. 61) and his "Excursus on Pindar's Religion," I 459. 73. The scholion 52a (Drachmann I 12o) discusses the problem of a doe with horns, citing Anacreon frag. 51. Further parallels are given by Aelian, Nat. Animal. 7.39, including Euripides frags. 857 and 740 (Nauck). Note also that in Soph. Electra (568ff) it is Agamemnon's slaying of a horned stag (KEpa~T17V RAakov) that incurs Artemis' anger; his fatal act is man's violation of the quiet powers of earth and nature and their goddess (even more so in Aesch. Ag. 135ff)which Pindar's half-divine Heracles is spared. See also Cook (above, n.67) II 465-66 and W. Ridgeway, The Early Age of Greece (Cambridge 19ol) I</page><page sequence="52">262 Charles Paul Segal 360-63, who discuss the connection of the doe with the Hyperborean land. On the hind generally, see Gruppe (above, n.69) Io37ff; Robert (above, n.67) 448ff. 74. For horns as a " fountain of energy," see Levy, Gate of Horn (above, n.43) 67; and 74 passim. Horns are well known as a symbol of fertility and strength, from palaeolithic times on: see also Cook, (above, n.67) I 5o6ff. For the grasp- ing of horns (as in the Minoan bull-leaping) to draw from a " reservoir of a yet more dynamic ebullition of energy " see Levy, 229; also Cook, I 499-500: the "fertilizing force" of the bull "is gathered up and culminates in its horns, bovine horns being sometimes a synonym of strength. Any one who grasps the bull's horns ipso facto obtains a share in its peculiar power." Artemis, the prominently horned stag (or hind), and possibly the Hyperborean land seem to be associated together on a crater from Melos of the mid seventh century B.C. (Athens, National Museum, number 9I1). Here is depicted a chariot with winged horses drawing Apollo and two maidens, plausibly conjectured to be the Hyperborean maidens. In front of the chariot, to the right, stands Artemis, wearing a quiver and holding an arrow in her left hand. With her right she grasps, by its horns, a stag (or hind). 75.

Wenn der gliickliche Preistriiger nach eben erlangtem Siege mit B1indern geschmiickt von den Zuschauern mit Bhittern beworfen wurde, so geschah das, weil das Laub eine Gotteskraft enthielt." If the wild olive tree at Olympia was first associated with the goddess Earth there and then transferred to Zeus, as Weniger suggests (pp. 36ff), this original transfer may underlie the role of Artemis in Pindar's myth of Heracles bringing the tree from the Hyperboreans. Heracles hunts her sacred animal and is received by her in the land from which he brings back the trees, also sacred to her. His transplanting the trees would be parallel to Zeus' taking over the wild olive from Ge at Olympia. In both cases the vital forces of nature and the earth, associated with aboriginal female powers, are enclosed in a Hellenic ritual where male gods predominate. The establish- ment of Zeus' primacy at Olympia would thus be the predecessor and prototype of Heracles' act, which itself derives from Zeus (17, 28). Pindar is usually emphatic about the domination of Zeus at Olympia: see O.2.12; 0.13.24-25; N.I.I3-I4. For the association between Zeus and Heracles at Olympia see the opening lines of 0.2 (3-4): " Pisa is of Zeus, but Heracles established the Olympian festival as the spoils of war." 78. Thus Mezger (above, n.5) 172-73 cites with approval Gurlitt's view that UKlpov ... aCpE7~aV (18) contains "die wirksamen Grfinde der Ueberredung." 79. For the gods' beneficent gifts to man in connection with the establishment of rites in Pindar see generally Duchemin (above, n.I5) 177-78: "Les cel~bra- tions crermonielles sont toujours, aux yeux des Grecs, un bienfait divin. Qu'il s'agisse en effet de faire don aux hommes a la fois du bl6 nourricier et des mysteres d'outre-tombe, ou d'instituer les Jeux sacres d'Olympie ou de Pyth6; il s'agit toujours pour les dieux de faire participer l'humanit " Il'un des bienfaits primordiaux dont ils sont les maitres: la vie sur la terre ou la survie aprZs la mort .. ." For Pindar's belief in the benevolence of the gods for the righteous</page><page sequence="53">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 263 see also Farnell's "Excursus on Pindar's Religion," II 471: in general, Erich Thummer, Die Religiositdt Pindars ("Commentationes Aenipontanae" XIII, Innsbruck 1957) 19, 40-41 (discussing frag. 130 Bowra) and 11-54 for a survey of previous literature. 8o. In 0.8.47, also, Apollo is perhaps connected with the Hyperborean land; after building the walls of Troy with Poseidon "he hurried driving to Xanthus and the well-horsed Amazons and to the Ister." See Farnell II 64, ad loc. In the Ninth Pythian it is also Apollo and persuasion (39) which "unlock" the potential richness and fruitfulness of the nymph Cyrene's beauty: "Hidden are wise Persuasions's keys to sacred love-delights." See Finley (above, n.3) I07ff, who would interpret the god's meeting with the woman (symbolizing "privacy, earth, stillness, potentiality") as the transformation of dim, unformed potenti- ality into the clarity of actualization, applicable to poetry also as " the transforma- tion of secret darkness into known and visible light" (p. io8). In discussing P. 9 he suggests three stages: "silent inwardness, change won through consent, and emergence into history"; it is in the second stage, "the crucial act of turning, . . that the god is most felt" (p. IIo). If this scheme were applied to 0.3 the Hyperborean land would be the equivalent of the women of 0.6 or P.9, full of potential, yet remote, still, and dark (the Hyperborean land is, in fact, associated with women, or the female element, through Artemis and the Hind and also in the worship of the Hyperborean women at Delos: see the following note). The journey of Heracles, bringing "change won through consent" (his reception by Artemis), would be the divine transforming element; and the "result" would be the planted and blooming trees at Olympia, where the once mysterious fertile power is realized as a beneficent and favoring source of life for men, embodied in the ordered norms of the ritual (the crowning) and placed within the well-defined, carefully marked-out limits of the sacred grove. 81. For the worship of the Hyperborean maidens on Delos (which may go back in some form to the Middle Cycladic period) see Nilsson (above, n.45) I 380-81; also 492ff. See also M. Mayer, s.v. "Hyperboreer" in Roscher's Lexicon (above, n.7I) 1.2, 2811-12; also Callimachus, Hymn 4, 278-99. 82. For the hind taking refuge with the Hesperidae in the Hyperborean land, see Furtwiingler in Roscher's Lexikon (above, n.7I) 2200oo; also Gruppe (above, n.69) 1038; Robert (above, n.67) 451, who suggests in fact that the pursuit of the hind is an older version of the search for the apples of the Hesperidae. 83. Robert (above, n.67) 451 with n.5, cites as a parallel to the story of the hind and the Hyperborean land a widespread fairy tale "in which a king's son hunting is led by a hind into a fairy land where he remains for a hundred years while he imagines that he spent only three days." 84. In 1.8, however, it is the goddess who will suffer pain as a result of her contact with mortality: see 39-41. For the evening moon as marking the pro- pitious time at the Olympian festival see also O.10o.73-75: EvS' 7orTEpovl bAESEv EtdvJ;TLOS oEAadvaS pa-rv d 0cos. See also the somewhat similar language in N.6.36-38, of the time of victory at the Pythian games. Finley (above, n.3) I 19 speaks of the celebration " in the summer moonlight" of 0.3 as expressing the " tempered legacy " of water and gold, " the gentle act of creating shade and crowns and the stern act of instituting games." 85. In Helen, too, might be present not only the associations of beauty, but also, perhaps, of fruitfulness; she is connected with trees and vegetation (she is associated, e.g., with a plane-tree at Sparta: see Theocritus I8.39ff). See</page><page sequence="54">264 Charles Paul Segal generally Nilsson (above, n.45) I 315: " In Helena lebt wahrscheinlich die mit dem Baumkult verbundene minoische Vegetationsg6ttin fort"; also I 211 with n.2, I 475-77. 86. Finley (above, n.3) 55 also notes the significant absence of the sun from the quotation in 0.3 of the proem of 0.I. 87. Farnell ad loc., II 26, emphasizes the religious significance of Jcyvds here, denying that it can mean simply "uncorrupt" or "unbribed": "there is no example of the word in a purely secular sense; it always has a religious nuance even in the sense of 'chaste'." His referring of it to "the sacrosanct character of the judges," however, is perhaps still too limiting. 88. Thus Mezger (above, n.5) 176 remarks that the ode seems to serve simultaneously as a "Siegeslied" for Olympia and a "Cultuslied" for the Theoxenia. So, too, Gildersleeve (above, n.25) 154: "The Third Olympian, then, combines the epinikian ode with the Theoxenian hymn." 89. Farnell II 24 remarks that the Theoxenia probably fuses the ideas of one god entertaining other gods or the gods entertaining the people or the people entertaining the gods; he notes, however, that " the epithet philoxenois suggests that the Tundaridai were regarded as hosts"; and this is the view taken in his note in the translation, I 19: it is the festival "at which the Twin-Brethren were supposed to entertain the other deities and the people of Akragas - at Theron's expense." See also the scholion to N.7.68a "There occurs in Delphi a banquet (xenia) for heroes to which the god invites the heroes." See also Farnell, Hero Cults (above, n.44) 228. 9o. For the Theoxenia as a communal meal to renew the life and vitality of the community and its natural surroundings (the "topocosm"), see Gaster (above, n.50) 30. See also Nilsson, Griechische Feste (above, n.67) 16off. The Olympian festival also may have had originally some significance as renewing an eight-year cycle of fertility (hence every ninth year), which would perhaps facilitate the connection with the Theoxenia and the myth of the planting of trees. See Frazer, Golden Bough (above, n.I9) 89ff, 103-10o5; but contra Gardiner (above, n.4I) 64ff, 73-76. 91. For this olive tree (the kallistephanos) see the scholion 0.3.6o (Drach- mann I 122), also ps.-Aristotle, Mirab. Auscult. 5I, and in general Frazer's Pausanias (above, n.41) III 573 (on 5.15.3). 92. For the pillars of Heracles as a symbol of the highest achievement see N.3.2o-2I, N.4.69, 1.4.11-12 (the language of this last perhaps a recollection of 0.3). Farnell II 256-57 notes that 0.3 may contain the first reference to them in European literature. 93. The moral function of the poet is perhaps also hinted at in the phrase Lvo ov pOJaacL at the beginning (3), which could refer not only to the nomos orthios (" loud-ringing strain") raising a monument (Farnell, ad loc. II 25), but also to making a song morally " right." Characteristically, however, it is probably the first two meanings, the sense of joy and vital energy, which predominate here. Gildersleeve (above, n.25) 156 would take the word in its narrowest sense as "simply 'raising', without any side-notion of column (0.7.86) or statue (I. 1.46)." 94. For the movement from present to past to present in the ode see Mezger (above, n.5) 176: "Mit grosser Kunst ist der Mythus Aihnlich wie P.3 und 0.7 so erziihlt, dass auf drei Stufen immer tiefer in die Vergangenheit zuriickge- gangen wird, um zulezt rasch wieder an den Ausgangspunct zuriickzukehren."</page><page sequence="55">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 265 95. Note, too, the grammatical coordination of "crown of excellence" and "shady plant" in 18 and the setting of the Dioscuri's part at the Olympian games (37-38) between the prayer for the propitiousness of Heracles (34) and the celebration of the Theoxenia (38-41). 96. This movement and oscillation in the ode well fit H. Fraenkel's descrip- tion of archaic poetry as "eher Geschehnis und Vorgang als ruhende Gestalt" (Gnomon 6 [1930] 19). 97. It is not altogether certain in Pindar's narrative whether one or two journeys to the Hyperboreans are intended. Most commentators say two, assuming that the first took place in the chase of the hind, and later Heracles, remembering the landscape and the trees, returned there when establishing the Olympian festival. So Farnell II 27, Mezger (above, n.5) 174, Gildersleeve (above, n.25) 159, Kakridis (above, n.2o) 475-76, and Puech (above, n.31) I 50-51. That only one journey is meant is maintained by Mayer (above, n.8i) 2816. Yet, with one journey, line 25 is difficult to explain: why should Heracles' " spirit" urge him forth to the land of the Ister just when he was in the midst of founding the Olympian festival - unless he had seen the trees there before (26ff). On the other hand Dissen's translation of the passage (cited by Kakridis, above) which supposed two journeys makes havoc of Pindar's tenses. The verbs governed by WvGa (84earo, 27) and Ei7E ('vrvE, 28b) would thus refer to a time prior to the action of the founding itself, which, however, is also told in the aorist tense (except possibly for alteL, 17, with the variant al'TE in some manuscripts; but the imperfect is supported by 4OaAAcv in 23). The interpreta- tion of 3&amp;4aTo as a pluperfect, "also Olbaum-Gewinnung und Hindin-Athlon zu trennen," is, in fact, accepted by Schwenn, s.v. "Pindaros," RE 40 (1950) 1643. The difference in time-levels is not very striking, and Pindar seems to have fused in some degree the two journeys, that for the hind and that for the trees, the milder, life-giving act replacing the violent and destructive one. The possibility of the two events being fused loosely into a single journey is perhaps supported by the parallel with Perseus' Hyperborean visit in the Tenth Pythian: the visit is described first (trap' otgs iore HEpOE3O ~iSCaoaoro, 31) and later is repeated with the addition of Athena's guidance (45), but a single visit is obviously meant and is also part of the same action as the slaying of the Gorgons and the revenge on Polydectes. See Farnell, II 218-i9 on P.Io.46: ". . . If Perseus had slain the Gorgon and settled with Poludektes, why does he go wandering to the Hyperboreans after his task was finished? Evidently he found them, as he found the Hesperides, when he was wandering round the compass to find the Gorgons." 98. For the gods as the directors of the telos see, inter alia, 0.13.104-10o5: v OBEo~ YE tL&amp;V TEo0; N.Io.29 (to Zeus): r&amp;v 8c 7"Ao~ &amp;v dv ' pywv; also P.Io.io-I i, 49-50; P.9-44; P.1.41; 0.8.13-14. See in general Farnell's " Excursus on Pindar's Religion," II 470; Thummer (above, n.79) Io9, who remarks on the benevolent role of the gods in human life as follows: "Wo Tyche, Daimon, Potmos, Moira, dort ist die helfende und filhrende Hand Gottes im Spiel. Wo Gott, dort sind auch die 'rettende Zeit' und das Telos." For the god's concern with maintaining the moral order and harmonious peace in the universe, see, e.g., the speech of Themis in L.8, esp. 47ff: "'Nor let the daughter of Nereus twice put into our hands the petals of strifes...' thus speaking the goddess addressed the children of Cronos; and 9*</page><page sequence="56">266 Charles Paul Segal they nodded with their immortal lids." Here they yield neither to eros nor eris (30, 32), though Norwood (above, n.ii) views the poem as presenting "a blend of the moral-government idea with a conception of deities no less absorbed than men in their personal concerns." Pindar's gods do not wantonly or cruelly destroy a mortal, though their punishment for his sin can often afflict the inno- cent like a forest fire (P.3.35-37, though even here Apollo rescues Asclepius to be a healer of mankind, 40ff). Pelops in 0.1 might be regarded as such an innocent bystander. Yet the gods even attempt sometimes to recall men from their own headlong folly, like Zeus' unheeded warnings to the Seven to " spare the path" (N.9.I9-22). The whole question of Pindar's religious feelings and their depth has been taken up again recently by Thummer who presents a thorough (but somewhat undigested) survey of relevant Pindaric passages as well as divergent modern views. It is clear that a systematic theology should hardly be expected of him, but Thummer exaggerates somewhat the implications of Nilsson's hesitation "ob Pindar eine tiefe religi6se Natur war" (above, n.45) 1 749, which Thummer takes as one pole of the modern attitude to Pindar's religious feeling. Yet Nilsson himself does admit Pindar's deep-rootedness in the traditional religion and the loftiness of his conception of the gods; see, e.g., I 748: "Pindar geh6rt zu den wirklich adeligen Miinnern, die nicht auf die angeborenen Vorrechte pochten, sondern einen edlen Sinn verlangten... Dies ist auch der Grund seiner bekannten Ummodelung der Mythen. Die Kritik des Xenophanes war ihm wohl kaum bekannt, dagegen verlangte die Adelsethik Anstand und Wiirde, und was man in dieser Beziehung von den Menschen forderte, musste man um so mehr von den erhabenen G6ttern fordern." For a balanced view see again Farnell's "Excursus," esp. II 468, 470ff. 99. On Pindar's relations with the Emmenidae see Gildersleeve (above, n.25) 125-27, Puech (above, n.3I) I 34, Farnell I 247-51 (on 1.2), Finley (above, n.3) 59-60. ioo. On the date of P.3 see Farnell II 135-36 who places it in 476, the same year as O.2 and 0.3; but see Finley (above, n.3) 90-91: "But not surely before P.I of 470." Schwenn (above, n.97) 1653 dates it in 474/73. For images of violence in connection with Hieron, see Finley 8iff. ioi. In dating these odes, I follow for the most part the chronology of Farnell. See also the chronological table and discussions by Schwenn (above, n.97) 1613-14, 1625ff; also Thummer (above, n.79) 55 with n.I. oz2. For the sensuous richness also of P.4, see, e.g., the description of the dolphins in 17, the simile of "the height of crimson-flowered spring" in 64, the description of Jason in 80-92, and his prayer at the setting out of the Argo in 93-98, the "crimson-purple wings" of Boreas' sons in 182-3. 1o3. For an interesting comparison between the prayers of O.i and 0.6 see Kakridis Hermes 63.429 (above, n. I3). The parallel between the two passages is noted also by Mesk (above, n.40) 146. 1o4. For the ambiguity of Poseidon as granting prayers for calm after suffering see also I.4.2Iff, after a passage on the losses in war of the family of the victor: " The mover of the earth who inhabits Onchestus and the sea-bridge before the walls of Corinth . . . raises from the bed the ancient glory of illustrious deeds" (Norwood, above, n.ii, 172ff, unconvincingly rejects 1.3/4 as spurious). See also 1.1.32-40. For the closeness of Apollo to men in Pindar see Finley (above, n.3) 32.</page><page sequence="57">Pindar's First and Third Olympian Odes 267 105. For the benevolence of Zeus' drawing off the flood (O.9-49ff) and Pin- dar's deliberate modification of the traditional story (in which Zeus sends the flood) see Duchemin (above, n. 5) 119-I20. So too in 0.9-57-66 Zeus lies with Protogeneia, daughter of Opus, not entirely for his own pleasure (see 4'KaAho, 58), but to save a noble line from dying out. io6. This divine favor despite the neglect of mortals in 0.7 is paralleled in P.4 by the eventual giving of Cyrene to the Battidae even though their early ancestor, Euphemus, and his companions, the Argonauts, neglected the god- given clod of earth (cf. Tcv 8' dAC8Ovro 4p74 E, P.4.4I, with the " cloud of forget- fulness" in 0.7-45 and the phrenes, 47). 107. The second part of Paean 9 (34ff) provides the life-giving balance to the destructive force of the sun in the first part: it tells of the local cult of the fountain-nymph Melia, with which a "sacred marriage" was connected (see 41-43): see Farnell, I 317-I9. The eclipse is dated to 463 B.c. io8. On the connection of human life with the alternation of fallow and fertile in N.6 and N.II, see Finley (above, n.3) 73ff, esp. 75: "The effect of the law [of vicissitude] is double. It binds man's life to the sleep and darkness of Earth, yet lifts it to periodic bloom and brilliance." I09. Norwood (above, n.ix) 71, with n.96, p. 231, argues that the choice of Polydeuces in N.io is the more moving because he believes he is a mortal until Zeus tells him "You are my son . . ." (8off). This fact, if true, would heighten the dramatic effect, but not change Polydeuces' position as a divine hero taking upon himself a portion of his brother's mortality. io. For an attempt to date 0.14 later, however (to 464 instead of the usually accepted 488), see W. Theiler, " Die Zwei Zeitstufen in Pindars Stil und Vers," Schriften der Kinigsberger Gelehrter Gesellschaft 17 (1941) 271-72. Iii. For the theme of simplicity in Pindar's later poetry see also Paean 4 (frag. 38 Bowra), esp. 46-48. 112. For the greater emphasis upon the basic relations between men, especially the relations of kinship, in Pindar's late poems see Theiler (above, n.iio) 267 with n.1. He remarks, "Gegentiber der Meinung, das Leben erfUlle sich in Sportsieg und Fest, tritt die Frage innerer Seelenordnung in den Vordergrund, Vorbote einer neuen Zeit, in der neue Mdichte das Athletenideal zuriickdriingen, das schon Pindar mehr wie einen huschenden Glanz denn als vollgewissen Besitz zu empfinden beginnt." On altruism and humane feelings in Pindar Norwood (above, n.ii) 230, n.89, cites P.3.47ff (Asclepius) and N.I.62-68 (Heracles); but this serving of humanity as a whole is quite different from the deep personal feelings of N. lo. Closer perhaps is the weeping of Aeson on seeing his son in P.4.I20-I23. 113. This translation of 1.7.39-40 follows Farnell ad loc. II 375, in omitting the period after 6Od'vo. in 39b and construing the &amp; T rLEPrId4 clause as object of Opaaalr. On such expressions of the personal experiencing of old age in Pindar's late poems, see Theiler (above, n.iio) 271-72.</page></plain_text>
