<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REVIEWS is here, or will come-all are true, each in its own sense. The New Testament knows that God's victory is sure and sometimes dates that victory in the cross, sometimes in a coming age. From the point of view of these writers, there is no contradiction. There are numerous tensions between the various ideas of the different au- thors, and these tensions exist even in the phrases of the same author, but there remains a striking unity in the main underlying ideas, and this unity is, after all, what has given the New Testament its unique worth. JOHN W. BEARDSLEE, JR. New Brunswick Thelogical Seminary Prayer in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha: A Study of the Jewish Concept of God. By NORMAN B. JOHNSON. Philadelphia: Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, I948. 77 pages. $i.oo. A man's prayers uncover his beliefs! Some such assumption forms the basis of this careful review of the prayers in the Old Testament Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. By this "in- direct approach to theology ... we catch a man off guard," and, without the distortion of con- scious consistency, his prayers reveal what char- acter he assigns to God. The author pursues three lines of inquiry: (i) What do the Jews pray for? (2) What inducements do they offer God to grant the petitions? (3) What response do they expect from God? The discussion of each section includes a citation of Old Testa- ment usage and a reference to New Testament or rabbinic prayers as abutments for the inter- testamental bridge. I. The aims and objects of Jewish prayer in this period are found to cover a wide range, from help in time of war through the supply of daily needs to righteousness and pure praise. Each goal reflects some aspects of the character of God. 2. Many readers will be startled to see listed among the "Means of Inducing God To Heed the Prayers" "The Appeal to God's Bargaining Instinct" and "An Appeal to God's Love of the Beautiful." And a greater question may be raised as to whether Jesus in Matt. 6:15 recom- mended forgiveness of men as a "reasonable way of gaining [?] forgiveness" from God. 3. Prayers in this period found response in voices, angelic visitation, dreams, or direct ful- filment. The audible voice response suggests an anthropomorphic idea of God, the angelic re- sponse a transcendent God, the dream response a God near at hand. A direct response exerts less control on the concept of God in relation to the world. In drawing his conclusions, the author recog- nizes the range and inconsistency in the Jewish thought about God, and he is content to outline the broader bases of belief. He is aware also of the fact that beyond the record the actual prac- tice of prayer was a living experience of the Jewish people. The deductive method of this monograph yields important results for the Jewish concept of God. The method has been put to very lim- ited use in discovering Jesus' vivid experience of God or the New Testament sense of God's act in the coming of the Kingdom. PAUL E. DAVIES McCormick Theological Seminary Sublimation. By J. TREVOR DAVIES. New York. Macmillan Co., I947. I48 pages. $1.75. Can thwarted persons be both ethical and healthy through sublimation? Dr. Davies surveys various views and con- cludes that neither free expression nor depres- sion is necessary. Inhibition-in other words, suppression or conscious control-is possible and harmless up to a certain point, depending upon the soundness of the individual. Deflec- tion of energy is possible too; deflection into activities that satisfy not only particular in- stincts but the whole self. People must inhibit some instincts at times, and they should deflect the energy into morally desirable, beneficial ac- tivities. In Davies' view, sublimation is such diver- sion of instinctive energy (not more libido) into higher and socially useful processes. It is effect- ed by objective values, through man's devotion to them. Moreover, sublimation may be con- sciously directed; and it may be applied not merely to man's surplus emotional energy but to all his instinctive energy. Thus sublimation is more than a safety valve for superfluous energy. It is also more than a "second-best way." Sub- limation is "as natural as the direct gratification of the instinct"; art, music, learning, and reli- 317</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION gion are as "natural" to men as sexual inter- course, physical combat, or running from dan- ger-and as satisfying. The moral self, the abid- ing self, is in control. "Best of all is it when the individual consciously and deliberately seeks to be moved by the Sum and Ground of all moral values, God, and makes 'the Will of God' his end and aim, as Jesus did." Sublimation pro- ceeds ideally through consecration to sanctifica- tion, a process "capable of continual increase and expression." Sublimation is "a means of satisfying the total needs of the individual." The limits of sublimation Davies finds in "what there is in a man to sublimate." Sublima- tion alone will not make a genius. It will, how- ever, make for the best life of which the indi- vidual is capable; and any failure to sublimate proves defect in the person and not in the prin- ciple. Davies rests his case upon opponents' incon- sistencies, his own idealistic assumptions, and his interpretation of creative work and the lives of great idealists. Nowhere does he distinguish clearly between emergency emotions, like anger and fear, that can be inhibited and their energies diverted by circumstances external or internal; acquired patterns like walking a tightrope, be- ing mayor, or loving Mary Jones, that can be changed; and physiological drives, like thirst, hunger, and sex-in the mature male, at least- that apparently cannot be inhibited or diverted except, within limits, for time and place of ex- pression (e.g., emissions during sleep). He seems to distinguish between inhibition, diversion, association, and development of in- terests; but he takes most, if not all, of these processes to mean transmutation of one quality of motivation into another. Indeed, he does not doubt that "the sex instinct is truly the creative instinct," "that its drive does lie behind all the artistic, creative, cultural activities of man." Moreover, he thinks Paul and many others have sublimated their sexual energy into love and service to humanity. To be sure, sexuality is for Davies only an essential element, and not the sole cause of man's higher activities; essential also is the apprehension of moral values. Never- theless, he cites no proof, no real observations, that transmutation occurs for any motivation, to say nothing of physiological drives. He disre- gards all the factual sudies of sex expression that were published prior to his book. When Davies (p. II9) speaks of "a fully inte- grated, harmonious personality" and says that "it is only when all the sides of our nature, in- stinctive, intellectual and moral are finding ade- quate expression that all is well with us," his language becomes to many of us psychologically and ethically intelligible. Such language encour- ages men to learn the facts of life, to practice self-denial when it is for the larger good, and to work for the best human life for all. W. S. TAYLOR Smith College Pastoral Counseling. By SEWARD HILTNER. New York and Nashville: Abingdon-Cokesbury, I949. 29I pages. $3.00. One of the most balanced and insightful thinkers in the field of clinical theology, from the point of view of Christian theology as a whole, is Seward Hiltner. His latest work com- bines theoretical with practical investigations in three main parts: "Principles of Pastoral Counseling"; "Preparation for Pastoral Coun- seling"; and "Resources for Pastoral Counsel- ing." The first part studies ministerial counsel- ing as an organic aspect of the pastor's total task, within the practical setting of the ministry and the theoretical setting of the Christian faith; the approach to this counseling in terms of a dynamic psychology that progressively cor- relates permanence of Christian prespective with constant discovery, interpretation, and re- construction of it in terms of the concrete under- standing of the need of the patient and of his own clarification of his situation and the con- solidation of his own co-operative insights. The second part analyzes the preparation for pas- toral counseling in terms of pastoral work in general, the pastor being the "leader of a seg- ment of the Christian community," and in terms of precounseling methods and understandings; the last part takes up religious resources and re- sources for learning pastoral counseling. In general, the book is written with great care in construction and not only is interesting for the general reader but has logical develop- ment and scholarly caution as well. It will add definitely to the literature on the subject which can be recommended as dependable, balanced, and well written. From the theological point of view there ap- pear to be some defects and some real strong points; the whole analysis is too far centered in growth at the expense of decision, and often self- understanding is treated as an obvious remedy, 3I8</page></plain_text>
