<plain_text><page sequence="1">Material Culture and the Magical Power of Dance Objects Richard Eves Australian National University ABSTRACT This paper takes up the call by scholars such as Alfred Gell to consider objects of material culture as objects, by examining them in the context of production, circulation and reception. Because they are unadorned and without visual interest, langarol, the hand-held artefacts used in some New Ireland dance performances, do not lend themselves to modes of analysis that see cultural objects as surrogate texts, the hidden meanings of which can be 'read'. This very 'lack' enables us more readily to discern their significance, which lies in their magical potency and in the performance of their creator, the shaman, in attracting, wielding and revealing his awesome power. The power sought is less power over others and more power to - the ability to realise projects that can elicit effects. If consciousness and body are one, such achievements are to be understood as embodiments of intentionality and agency. It is through the production and wielding of such objects that people make themselves. Key words: material culture, dance objects, magic, power, New Ireland, Melanesia The anthropologists of the nineteenth century, who were preoccupied with cultural and racial difference, saw the study of material culture as essential to classifying human cultures and explaining racial difference. This approach was limited by its narrow conceptual framework- an either/or choice between diffusionism and evolutionism. Though objects of material culture were often taken seriously, a focus on form being an instance of this, largely they served the comparative project of mapping difference. Over the last decade or so, with freedom from these restrictive paradigms and spurred by the work of Daniel Miller and others, there has been a burgeoning of studies which take material culture much more seriously in its own right. Commenting on this, Lissant Bolton has suggested that the increasing detachment of the study of objects from the museum environment has contributed to a broader definition of material culture. Today, beyond the kinds of objects which normally sit on museum storeroom shelves, different items such as architecture, landscape and food are included in the definition (Bolton 2001: 253). This has led some scholars to eschew such terms as 'material culture', 'material', 'art', 'artefact' and 'object' in favour of more inclusive terms such as 'things' (Bell and Geismar2009:6). Some of the renewed interest in material culture can be seen as a reaction to the ascendancy of the linguistic turn in anthropology, with its focus on language and meaning. Rather than subjecting material culture to hermeneutic and semiotic scrutiny in order to disclose the meanings embedded in it, an enlightening alternative is to consider objects as objects, focussing on their essential characteristics. This argument has been powerfully enunciated by Ann Stahl who argues that it is to its detriment that late-twentieth century anthropology has privileged language and linguistic signification as a site of culture making (Eves 2009; Stahl 2002: 827; see also Gell 1998: 6-7, 14; Layton 2003: 447; Miller 2005: 3). Much of the anthropology in this vein has been dominated by the conviction that cultural worlds, much as texts, are open to decoding or exegesis through 'reading' (Stahl 2002: 827). 250 Oceania 79, 2009</page><page sequence="2">Stahl argues that though anthropologists are increasingly interested in the active role that object worlds play, especially in the context of the historical processes of mixing or entanglement, and how cultural worlds are changed as a consequence, there is nevertheless a privileging of language, since there is a preoccupation with meaning which is linguistically conceptualised (2002: 828). The focus in this quest for meaning is 'a retrospective, reflective mode of understanding that obscures the practical domain of human action' (Stahl 2002: 830). One consequence of this is a tendency to side-step or explain away the significance that informants attach to objects (Henare et al. 2007: 1). Other anthropologists have argued along similar lines. For example, Jeremy Coote and Anthony Shelton maintain that the pursuit of the meaning of art objects has meant the neglect of 'their essential power as objects' (Coote and Shelton 1992: 4). Marilyn Strathern argues against approaches which understand objects as little more than illustrative of things external to them, and advocates engagement with what the object itself reveals and what effects it has (Strathern 1990: 38). Alfred Gell, too, suggests there is a need for anthropologists to focus on the object as object and to break away from aesthetics, particularly in relation to art objects. For him, an '"anthropology of art" focuses on the social context of art production, circulation, and reception, rather than the evaluation of particular works of art, which ... is the function of a critic' (Gell 1998: 3). Gell advocates 'methodological philistinism,' which consists in taking an attitude of resolute indifference towards the aesthetic value of works of art, an issue I return to later (Gell 1992: 42). Along these lines, Amiria Henare and colleagues have suggested that the approach to objects should be dominated by 'purposeful naivete,' the aim being 'to take "things" encountered in the field as they present themselves, rather than immediately assuming that they signify, represent, or stand for something else' (Henare et al. 2007: 2). Methodologically, they suggest that this means holding issues of interpretation at bay and attending to things as they emerge in context. They recommend, 'rather than providing data to which theory is applied, revealing the strengths and flaws of an existing theoretical model, [allowing] the things encountered in fieldwork ... to dictate the terms of their own analysis' (Henare et al. 2007: 4). Similarly, I do not seek to excavate the hidden or opaque meanings of the artefacts under consideration here (see Eves 2009). What emerges from my account, rather, is their role in indigenous conceptions of power and agency and their execution. Elsewhere, I have argued that, rather than being seen in a Cartesian and individualised way, agency should be seen in terms of practice, as centrally concerned with the realisation of projects through bodily action and movement which connect people in their intersubjective world (Eves 1998, 2000). In my view, intentional consciousness does not exist independently of the body and does not guide the body's practical engagement with the world (Eves 1998: 18). Rather, intentionality belongs to the body and endows it with its basic connection to the world. If intentionality and agency are seen in terms of a practical orientation to the world, then manufactured objects, such as langarol (M), the dance objects discussed here, should be seen as embodiments of intentionality and agency made visible in the intersubjective social field. They constitute the embodiment of a magician's potency, his power and ability to elicit effects in an audience. This is not power in the sense of power over others, but rather in the sense of the ability to realise projects that elicit profound effects, such as awe and wonder. This power to may be realised simply through bodily strength but it can also be realised through magic. Much social action for the Lelet involves making this kind of power manifest. LANGAROL AND THE MAGIC OF BUAI In the anthropology of art and material culture, New Ireland is known mainly for the elaborately carved and colourful malangan sculptures which are ceremoniously displayed at mortuary feasts before being burned or left to decompose in the forest. These sculptures have captured the imagination and interest of collectors and scholars for a considerable time, as Eves 251</page><page sequence="3">Material Culture and the Magical Power of Dance Objects evidenced by the extensive collections and literature about them (Kuechler 1988, 1992, 2002; Lincoln 1987). By contrast, langarol, the small dance objects discussed here, are aesthetically insignificant in appearance and, being held in the hand, their form is largely obscured from the audience's view. Correspondingly, they would seem to hold little of interest to anthropologists of art and material culture. Closer examination, however, promises to enrich our approaches to understanding material culture more generally, and it is in this spirit that I explore them here. The ethnography on which this paper is based comes from the Lelet Plateau, New Ireland, where, since 1990, 1 have carried out approximately twenty months' fieldwork. The Lelet population, about one thousand people, live in hamlets dispersed across the mountains at the centre of the island province. As is usual in rural Papua New Guinea, the Lelet rely on gardening for subsistence and to obtain cash to pay for school-fees, medical expenses and food to supplement their diet. Like many other Papua New Guineans, they have a long history of contact, and have shown a general inclination to appropriate the new and exogenous into their culture. This has included their ready embracement of Christianity, cash-cropping and also the kinds of material culture and dances I discuss here. Due consideration needs to be given to the imported nature of the langarol. Much of the discussion of material culture in the Pacific has been placed in the context of colonialism and has focussed on the local incorporation of colonial objects or the colonial culture's incorporation of local objects. Some of the impetus for this has come from the work of Nicholas Thomas, who coined the phrase 'colonial entanglements' to capture the complex interactions, exchanges and intermixtures that occur in the contexts of colonial encounters (Thomas 1991). Less attention has been paid to the movement and adoption of material culture from within a country, usually from different language and cultural groups (see Harrison 2000). When this has been discussed it has usually been assimilated into broader discussions of exchange. Though born of the social and exchange relations that evolved in the colonial encounter, the kinds of 'entanglement' that have introduced the langarol to the Lelet are of a different order from those Thomas discusses. The circulation of objects, rituals and forms of knowledge is not unique to the colonial period, for the extensive circulation of things beyond the boundaries of localised communities has been shown to have existed well prior to this in Papua New Guinea, for example. What the colonial and the post-colonial periods enabled was the exchange of things between cultural groups which had not previously had such linkages. Langarol are part of a much broader set of magical and shamanic practices imported from other parts of New Ireland and New Britain, which had no links with the Lelet in the past. These practices are named Buai (K), after the betel or areca nut, a widely-used stimulant, for just as there are many branches to the fruiting hand of the areca palm, so there are many branches of Buai. The practices were adopted by Lelet who worked in these other places in the period after the second world war (cf. Nachman 1981a: 67, 1981b: 46) .3 Buai is especially associated with these places, most notably the Duke of York Islands, the Gazelle Peninsula and southern New Ireland, although other places are said to possess it (see Eves 1995; Eves 2009; see also Albeit 1987; Enos 1977; Nachman 1978, 1981a, 1981b; Wagner 1986). Lihir Island, for example, is alleged to have forms of Buai, especially some of the more powerful forms of sorcery. Buai appears to have spread widely in the region and now forms an arena in which practitioners can compete with each other, as I have described elsewhere (Eves 2004). The main practitioners of Buai are shamans or magical experts called Tena Buai (K), although a considerable number of others may own some Buai magic, such as those used for seduction and theft, which may have been purchased or been given by a relative or friend conversant with Buai (Eves 1995, 2004, 2009). Though not always so in other places, among the Lelet the practice of Buai is restricted to men, and as such constitutes an assertion of masculine power (cf. Turan cited in Enos 1977; Nachman 1981b: 46-48, 55). To become a Tena Buai requires a process of initiation, usually involving the consumption of potent magical substances derived from the initiating Tena Buaïs body or prepared by him, and transferred 252</page><page sequence="4">by a familiar to the initiate, who thus incorporates the power (Eves 1995). Once a Tena Buai has been initiated into a branch of Buai, he is able to create new forms of the type of power he has attained. Thus, while the basic form is transferred to a Tena Buai in the initiation process, there remains scope for enhancement and development of that basic form of power. A specialist in this area would have considerable creative powers, enabling him to experience revelatory dreams in which he learns dances and songs from spirit beings. He would also have had transmitted to him the power to create the magic needed to enhance dance performances and to protect the dancers from sorcery attack. Similarly, the knowledge used to produce the langarol is gained when a man is first initiated into Buai, and should he wish to alter the basic form transferred to him, he can do so by initiating further revelatory dreams. This is consistent with a general process of cultural transmission in Melanesia where the transfer of artefacts is accompanied by rights to reproduce them. Thus, as Simon Harrison notes of this general phenomenon, 4it was not simply the artefacts, but also the practices of making and using the artefacts, that could be "owned" and transacted' (Harrison 2000: 668). The assimilation of the exogenous magical practices of Buai is greatly facilitated by the existing cultural world of the Lelet, which is deeply pervaded by a belief in the efficacy of magic and the existence of powerful spirit beings. Although they have no local precedent, like the magical cult to which they belong, the langarol meet with resonances in the Lelet culture and these allow their ready assimilation. Not only are the Lelet already familiar with magic and spirits, but their magical practices already include the use of materials with metaphorical properties, as do the langarol. The creation of Lelet langarol, which are magical objects which create powerful effects, involves the mixing of exogenous dance objects with local conceptions of spirit beings and magic to produce new hybrid objects. Further, these new objects permit the arena of dance to be used in an unprecedented way. Langarol cause violent uncontrollable shaking in the hands and bodies of those who hold them. A langarol that does not do this is considered inefficacious and the dance performance in which it is used will be considered a failure. Several named varieties of these objects cause different forms of bodily movement, usually a variation on uncontrolled shaking. Most langarol are very similar in appearance, being cylindrical with some form of decoration at the end that points away from the body when held in the hand. Commonly, they comprise bark that has been rolled into a tube, bound tightly with vine and possibly decorated with coloured ochre. Importantly, this tube contains various substances included for the properties they embody and the powerful spirit beings they invoke- things known for their properties of attraction, and things meant to impart movement. One type within the general category langarol is also called langarol, and causes particularly violent shaking of the hand, in an up and down manner. Another type is called labum (U), the holder of which is distinguished by a red cordyline leaf in his hair. Another type said to have considerable power to pull the holder is wanakakit (U), which means the holder will be dragged off into the forest. Another, reputedly from the Duke of York Islands, is called pampam (U) which causes a to-and-fro movement. Pampam also contains other named sub- categories, such as ledon (U), decorated by pig hairs and made from a particular type of epiphyte that hangs from trees. When bespelled prior to a dance, this type is said to jump out of the magician's hand and hop around on the ground before jumping back to his hand again. Another type of langarol is called kwaba (U), or wild pig, and moves in a circular motion. This looks different from most langarol, being a parcel with a flat base and a neck in which a pig's tail is often placed as decoration. Sometimes the type being used can be ascertained by observing the identifying insignia a Tena Buai wears. This may comprise a leaf, in his hair or simply held in his hand, or he may have a particular vine twined around some part of his body. As langarol may be targets of the magic of other magicians, they sometimes contain things of a protective nature. A Tena Buai might try through magical means to knock the langarol out of the hands of the dancers or to break them in half. Not only are these dance objects an important aspect of visible power, they are also considered to enhance the aesthetic Eves 253</page><page sequence="5">Material Culture and the Magical Power of Dance Objects appeal of the dance and so to attract people to watch the dance performance. To facilitate this, many langarol contain things renowned for their properties of attraction, such as bark from a tree that, because of its prodigious fruiting habit, attracts numerous birds. Many people will likewise be attracted to the dance. Since violent shaking movement is a measure of success, other things known for their power, and particularly for their properties of movement, will also be used. This may be bark from a tree struck by lightning in a cyclone, or the legs of a grasshopper renowned for its ability to jump.4 Some use a particular type of spider which has a web that vibrates violently when touched.5 A major constituent of these hand held dance objects, and perhaps the most powerful, are fragments of various types of bone or pieces of flesh. Particularly important are fragments of bone associated with strength or movement. For example, bone from the leg is used because it is associated with the strength which enables people to walk. One langarol described to me included some bone from a person who had been murdered and whose life-force upon death had become a rather capricious roaming spirit (lau [M]) which is best avoided because it can attack those who go close to it. These spirit beings are also associated with the waterspouts that occur out to sea, an obvious sign of movement and power. This langarol also included some bone from a type of bush spirit, a lagas, and some human bone. While all the types of bone or flesh used in the construction of a langarol are considered to have a great deal of power, a fragment of lagas bone is a common ingredient because it is particularly powerful. Lagas are largely monstrous derivations from a basic anthropomorphic body, varying in appearance, size, and their effects on humans (Eves 1998: 155-157, 160- 163). Many narratives of past encounters describe them as cannibals, sorcerers and tricksters, renowned and reviled for their attacks upon humans. Because of their ability to cause illness and bodily harm to those who come close to them, they are feared and generally avoided. The power of the lagas is manifest in a kind of 'fight' that inheres in its skin. The effects of this 'fight' range from merely feeling the presence of the lagas to total disorientation, loss of consciousness and faculties, and even death. Lagas are rarely seen but often experienced, and mainly inhabit the heavily forested remote areas of the Lelet plateau and surrounding mountains. Indeed, it is said that prior to the coming of the Christian church, the area inhabited by these beings was much greater than it is today and encompassed the area of human settlement, from which they occasionally kidnapped inhabitants. Though not all lagas are dangerous, the arrival of Christianity has seen them recast as 'evil spirits', and it is said that they were driven to remote and peripheral spaces by the power of the Church.8 ASSEMBLING THE DANCE OBJECT A considerable amount of what I describe about langarol was gathered from interviews and discussions with Tena Buai, and other men who had participated in dance performances. This included detailed interviews with three of the six Lelet Tena Buai, all considered to be experts in the Buai associated with dance and to have the magical powers enabling them to create new dances, songs and paraphernalia through revelatory dreams. The information gained from these interviews and other discussions about Buai was supplemented by my observations of the construction of some langarol and the accompanying preparations made by a Lelet dance troupe which travelled to the coastal village of Kunago to perform at a mortuary feast. The Kunago performance was organised cooperatively by two experts in Buai (a senior and a junior Tena Buai) and involved the participation of about a dozen young men from three of the four Lelet villages. The preliminary preparations took place in the week leading up to the dance performance while the Tena Buai and dancers were secluded in a men's house (cf. Nachman 1981a: 67). The dance objects were constructed in a makeshift shelter erected in the men's house cemetery, and involved the re-use of some constituents from a langarol made by a man who had died several years before. Like other langarol described to me, this one included pieces of bone, in this case three pieces, including one from a lagas, one from a man 254</page><page sequence="6">Eves who was killed in a knife attack and one from a man who had died a normal death. Once the bones were removed from the old langarol, they were laid out with all the other necessary materials. In addition to some of the botanical matter from the old dance object, these included some thorn studded vines and scrapings from a pandanus leaf that has thorns along its edge. These were eventually mixed together in a container fashioned from the skin of a banana palm. A piece of pandanus leaf was also used to form the tube that would eventually enclose all the ingredients. When the botanical ingredients were ready, the junior Tena Buai chewed ginger and sprayed it over the material and his hands. The senior Tena Buai also chewed ginger, but sprayed it around where the dance objects were being constructed. Then the ingredients were laid out on a rectangular piece of the pandanus leaf. The initial step in the construction of the langarol by the senior Tena Buai commenced with the placement of a large piece of thorn- studded vine on the pandanus leaf. This was followed by two small pieces of vine and then some of the scraped and shredded botanical matter, including some bark of a coconut palm that had been struck by lightning. It also included an insect called lasepbo (M) and a scorpion. The former insect is so named because it can kill pigs (sep - to kill, fight; bo - pig). This and the scorpion were said to bite the spirit beings and so arouse them and make them present. The pieces of bone were then placed on these ingredients, as was a piece of human earlobe which had belonged to the senior Tena Buaïs in-law, who had been attacked and killed with an axe the previous year. The earlobe was kept in a small bottle and was carefully removed with sticks. Once this was placed on the bones, it was covered with some red ochre and then the leaf was rolled into a tube enclosing the ingredients. To ensure that the ingredients stayed in the tube, it was bound up tightly with vine. For decoration, the langarol was smeared with red ochre power moistened by the spraying of masticated ginger. Some of the dancers were involved in the construction of the langarol but only in the more minor preparations, such as assembling the ingredients and scraping the barks. Importantly, the placement of the bones and the earlobe were undertaken by the senior Tena Buai, who only touched them with sticks, indicating that these substances were considered dangerous. During the whole process of assembly there was very little talking and then only in low voices. Also during this time those involved neither smoked nor chewed areca nut. EMPOWERING THE DANCE OBJECT When the dance objects were completed, they were stood upright in the container in which the ingredients had been mixed and which still contained any remainder (see Figure 1). The langarol made by the senior Tena Buai was, however, separated from the others, being placed in another container, which also contained the bottle with the earlobe, which had been buried under the remaining ingredients. All the dance objects were orientated in one way- in the direction of the sun rise. Following their placement in the container, the magician sprayed masticated ginger over the dance objects and the junior Tena Buai also bespelled them. This entailed the junior Tena Buai holding up the container and whispering the magical spells, to the accompaniment of the dance troupe singing a song to the beat of an hour-glass drum. Meanwhile, the senior Tena Buai was also incanting spells, which in this case were clearly audible to everyone present. The spells used invoke the presence of the various spirits, as well as evoking movement and dynamism through the use of various metaphors. One spell called on the waterspouts mentioned previously and another used the image of an earthquake, because of the enormous power of these natural occurrences, a power, it is said, that is able to move the ground in a way that a human or even a machine cannot. The physical completion of the langarol does not mean it is ready for use in a dance, for it must be bespelled a number of times prior to the actual performance, to empower the objects, and at the same time the efficacy of the magic is tested (loktong laxalangarol [M]). For the bespelling, the magician holds the langarol and utters the spell, while the dance troupe sings songs to the beat of a hour-glass drum. The songs, called warabat (K), are said to give 'power' 255</page><page sequence="7">Material Culture and the Magical Power of Dance Objects Figure 1 . Tena Buai and langarol 256</page><page sequence="8">Eves to the occasion and are also sung while the dance troupe is en route to the place of performance. These songs are dreamed by the Tena Buai and narrate tales of encounters with powerful spirit beings, such as the lagas whose presence is invoked in the langarol. For the langarol whose construction I witnessed, the first bespelling took place at twilight on the same afternoon they were made. They were bespelled again the next day in the morning and afternoon and yet again on the following morning, before the dance troupe departed for the performance. At the first bespelling, the junior Tena Buai held one langarol in each hand horizontally in front of himself while he whispered the magic. After a short time, he began shaking violently and had to be held up by others. He bespelled two more langarol, this time holding them in front of his body at stomach level. Prior to beginning to shake, he thrust the objects straight out in front. A further pair was also bespelled, and this time when he was shaking the senior Tena Buai sprayed ginger at his feet and around him. A similar bespelling was done when the troupe was encamped at the coast, again at dawn and dusk (see Figure 2). This time, when incanting the spells, the junior Tena Buai progressively turned a full circle, so that all the points of the compass were faced. If a dance object feels heavy in the magician's hand when bespelled at this time, he knows it will have a strong effect when the dance takes place. Figure 2. Tena Buai bespelling langarol prior to dance Because langarol use dangerous and powerful substances and invoke dangerous and powerful spirit beings, extreme caution must be practised during their construction and use, and those involved must engage in measures to protect themselves. Such measures were evident when the magicians sprayed masticated ginger, a substance with powerful protective properties, and when the Tena Buai avoided touching the bones and earlobe. Another example was the great care taken to wash hands after handling the barks and other ingredients. A further way in which the caution manifests itself, and by far the most important, is the following of a regime of fasting and sexual abstinence. Depending on the type of dance, the regime extends from one or two days to two weeks. The magicians producing the dance, the dancers and the musicians will all abide by strictures on the consumption of certain foods and contact with women. These regimes, referred to as welwen (M), aim to achieve several things 257</page><page sequence="9">Material Culture and the Magical Power of Dance Objects Figure 3. Dancer holding langarol towards making the dance a success. Not only do they make the magic employed efficacious, they also make the dancers lightweight and able to withstand the power of the langarol and the spirit beings invoked as well as sorcery directed at the dancers by other Tena Buai (cf. Clay 1987: 66; Nachman 1981a: 67). Contact with women is avoided because women are believed to embody a form of power that is antithetical to magical power (Eves 1998: 47-50, 2004: 345, 2009). As this power is considered heavy, it can make the dancers unable to dance in a buoyant and vibrant manner, as well as dissipating or weakening the magic employed in the dance. Furthermore, should a dancer who is to hold a langarol have sexual contact prior to the dance, it is said that the langarol will not shake, meaning that the magic will not be able to summon the spirits. Contact with women also affects the magic that is employed to protect the dance troupe from sorcery attack by other Tena Buai. A dancer must avoid not only sexual contact but also close spatial proximity to women and also to things that have been in contact with women. To minimise contact with women, the dance troupe lives in a men's house prior to the performance, though such regimes seem to be less rigorously enforced today than in the past, when the seclusion meant that the magicians and dancers spent all their time in the men's house. Nowadays, the participants often have other commitments and leave the men's house, returning only for practice sessions and other rituals associated with the dance. In such circumstances, if the participants come too close to women, they are given astringent-tasting substances that eliminate any contamination from their bodies. When in seclusion, or semi-seclusion, the dancers cook their own food to ensure it is not contaminated by women, and that only the most appropriate foods are consumed. Certain foods are assiduously avoided, particularly those considered 'heavy', including greens, peeled taro and certain meat, such as pork. Water is also considered heavy and must be avoided. The foods that I saw consumed while observing the dance troupe included rice, tinned fish, sweet potato, wild possum, young coconut flesh and fluid, oranges, sugar cane and taro roasted on the fire. All foods, however, should be consumed in very small quantities. The participants also consumed, with boiled bananas, an oily substance called ku (U), made from coconut milk that 258</page><page sequence="10">Eves has been boiled down (cf. Nachman 1981a: 68). The coconut oil is a particularly important component of the diet because it often has other magical substances added to it which enhance the dancers by making them suitably lightweight, buoyant and agile, and thus able to dance skilfully and successfully (see Figure 3.). Sometimes this property of lightness and agility will be achieved by adding substances to the coconut oil to cause vomiting and diarrhoea to make the dancers lose weight quickly. The coconut oil can also have additions that make the dancers attractive to women watching the performance. CONCLUSION The process of creating and displaying the langarol is governed by the logic of revelation, in which things previously concealed come to be dramatically disclosed. Thus, the production of the langarol is a process in which magical powers are made manifest with the aim of inspiring awe in the audience. This same logic of awe-inspiring revelation also characterises the dance performance. In the case of the dance at Kunago, the dancers, splendid in their regalia and escorted by musicians, magicians and other supporters, moved in procession from a cave in the forest into the public space of the dance arena to the accompaniment of drums and songs. Then a very dramatic drumming of bamboo tubes announced the start of the performance. Further, in a test of the 'pulling' power of a Tena Buaïs magic, dances are often begun while others are being performed. If few spectators are drawn away from others to his dance, the efficacy of his magic is cast into doubt, but if many are drawn, his power is realised. Steven Nachman correctly writes of this in terms of the power of the performers to 'seduce' the audience, and the most successful seducers become the winners of the competition (1981a: 69). Melanesian dance is generally considered to display the characteristics of either martial prowess or sociality. On the one hand, massed lines of warriors moving as one coordinated body aim to evoke fear in the enemy. O'Hanlon, for example, suggests that the massing of clan members in dances is extremely important, as it conveys the potency of the group, bringing rival groups to negotiate and solve conflicts (O'Hanlon 1983: 324, 331). On the other hand, dances are seen as displaying commensality, sociality and goodwill. Knauf t, for example, describes the dance as having a social purpose, promoting healing, conflict resolution, and friendly camaraderie (Knauft 1999: 78; see also Munn 1986: 181). For the Lelet, there is no such polarisation, and the character of dances is not so clear-cut. More accurately, they are a complex cultural form with many purposes and significances. This is particularly so with the new imported dances, which may form an arena in which men display their skill, athleticism and attractiveness and seek to attract sexual partners, through the use of love magic, but they may also be an arena in which men competitively seek to shame, humiliate and injure rivals in sorcery battles and magical contests (cf. Nachman 1981a: 67, 69; 1981b: 50-51). In their use of malign magic, these dances bear some similarity to warfare, for not only is the language used replete with military metaphor but the magic itself was previously used in warfare. Dances provide an arena for the proclamation of identity and power and for challenges between individuals exhibiting their extraordinary powers (see also Feeley-Harnik 1988;Hardin 1993: 141;O'Hanlon 1983, 1992). Through their use of numerous forms of the dark and malign forces of sorcery and other magic, the practitioners aim to reveal their ability to withstand powerful and dangerous forces, both of a human and 'supernatural' kind (see Nachman 1981b). It is in the context of such battles and displays of power that the langarol play their part. As I mentioned earlier, these powerfully charged dance objects aim to produce violent shaking in the holder. In the context of the dance, shaking indicates asserti veness and self-mastery, demonstrating the dancer's ability to withstand the powerful forces that have been invoked. There is a strong emphasis on risk here - of the dancers putting themselves at risk by confronting beings and substances that have the power to cause illness and death. Given that langarol are not used in women's dances and that the production and display of them involves 259</page><page sequence="11">Material Culture and the Magical Power of Dance Objects the assiduous avoidance of women, their use is a masculine assertion of power, allowing men to reveal their skills and invulnerability, and so be seen as powerful agents (cf. Clay 1987: 71). In defining the importance and value of objects, the privileged factor tends to be exchange, and this includes both the active circulation and its inverse, the non-circulation of objects. Those objects that are kept out of circulation have enhanced value, Annette Weiner argues (Weiner 1994: 394). Some objects, she says, 'become symbolically dense - so dense with cultural meaning and value that others have difficulty prying these treasures away from their owners' (1994: 394, see also 1992). Density, she contends, accrues through the object's association with its 'owner's fame, ancestral histories, secrecy, sacredness, and aesthetic and economic values' and objects that are particularly dense circulate much more slowly than others, which can be exchanged, sold or traded with impunity (Weiner 1994: 394). Density is applied mainly to exchangeable items in Weiner 's usage, but it could usefully be extended to include other objects of material culture which are not items of exchange, such as langarol. In Weiner's terms, langarol would almost certainly be considered less dense, since its life-span is not great and it does not have an enduring presence, being assembled in the lead up to the dance performance and disassembled afterwards. Neither is a langarol individually named nor have they the same kind of history as the objects Weiner discusses, such as Kula valuables, which have extensive life- and exchange histories. However, while a langarol has little density in terms of exchange- value, it could be considered very dense in other ways. Here I have in mind the dimensions of power it embodies, since it is saturated with magical and spiritual power in a way that valuables may not be. Langarol possess a magical density much like the canoe-boards discussed by Gell (1992) in his paper, 'The technology of enchantment and the enchantment of technology.' Just as canoe- boards are intended to draw an audience of Kula traders who will be dazzled and bewildered by the sight, the langarol is meant to draw a large audience who will be impressed by the dance performance. Both langarol and canoe-boards are meant to elicit effects in observers through their magical power. For Gell, the visual effects of the canoe-boards are not directly significant, but rather the appearance of the boards is interpreted as evidence of magical power emanating from them. The efficacy of these objects is achieved through what Gell calls 'the enchantment of technology, the fact that technical processes, such as carving canoe-boards, are construed magically so that, by enchanting us, they make the products of these technical processes seem enchanted vessels of magical power' (1992: 46). Importantly, in the contexts of Kula expeditions and exchanges, it is the magical efficacy of the canoe-boards as the canoes arrive at their destination that is understood to facilitate the exchange process, as the Kula exchange partners observing from the beach lose their ability to bargain adequately, and consequently, are overly generous when they engage in exchange. In short, the boards induce the Kula partners to give up their best valuables, without holding any back (Gell 1992: 55). Gell develops this essay theoretically in his posthumously published work, Art and Agency. Avoiding approaches which privilege symbolic communication, he places the emphasis on 'agency, intention, causation, result, and transformation' (Gell 1998: 6). For Gell, agency is 'attributable to those persons (and things . . .) who/which are seen as initiating causal sequences of a particular type, that is, events caused by acts of mind or will or intention, rather than the mere concatenation of physical events. An agent is one who "causes events to happen" in their vicinity' (Gell 1998: 16). This position has been taken up by other scholars of material culture, Bolton suggesting, for example, that it is essential to 'analyse things on the basis of agency, in terms of what things do, rather than what they are, or what is done to or with them' (Bolton 2001 : 266, 2003: 129). While my analysis here is sympathetic to this line of reasoning, I would argue that what things do is often not so inseparable from what things are or what is done to or with them. This is certainly the case with my particular subjects of discussion, dance objects, for the materials used in making these, the bespelling of them by magicians and the wielding of them by the dancers, are essential to what they are, to what they do and to the effects they have. Indeed, 260</page><page sequence="12">Eves as I have explained, these objects do not have an identity outside of the context of the dances in which they are used. However, they have great power and efficacy that belie the short temporal duration of their lives and this sets them apart from the kinds of objects that are often the subjects of material culture studies. The "action'-centred approach' of Gell takes art to be a system of action, intended to change the world rather than to encode symbolic propositions (1998: 6). Action is decidedly social in Gell's view (Gell 1998: 17). Reflecting his intellectual genealogy, Gell's theory focuses on art objects as part of social relations, a typical concern of British social anthropology. As he sees it, 'in so far as anthropology has a specific subject-matter at all, that subject-matter is "social relationships"- relationships between participants in social systems of various kinds' (Gell 1998: 4). This approach is evident, as I noted above, in his critique of aesthetic theories of art and in his suggestion that an anthropology of art should focus on the social context of art production, circulation and reception (Gell 1998: 3). As he further remarks, 'art objects . . . are produced and circulated in the external physical and social world. This production and circulation has to be sustained by certain social processes of an objective kind, which are connected to other social processes (exchange, politics, religion, kinship, etc)' (Gell 1998: 3). However, confining art objects and material culture to this framework tends to subsume any theory of material culture to the realm of exchange. As Gell himself notes, his approach is decidedly Maussian, emphasising gift exchange (Gell 1998: 9). What needs to be a recognised is the broader intersubjective world in which material objects are produced, and while this may include the exchange of items of value via social relationships, it is not necessarily so (see also Eves 2009). The importance of the langarol, for example, does not lie in circulation, but in their potent effects in the intersubjective space of a dance watched by an large audience who, like the Trobriand Kula-traders, are awestruck. Despite this point of difference with Gell, like him I see it as important to examine the production of objects such as langarol in terms of agency and intentionality. Much as Daniel Miller has suggested for material culture, the dance objects langarol quintessential^ illustrate 'how the things that people make, make people' (Miller 2005: 38). NOTES 1 . All non-English words are italicised. I use: K - Kauna; M - Mandak and U - Unknown to delineate their origins. As the dance objects and the associated ritual practices associated with them are imported from other places, the origins of many of the terms are unclear. 2. This is illustrated in Thomas' Entangled Objects, which has chapters on 'The Indigenous Appropriation of European Things' and 'The European Appropriation of Indigenous Things,' but no exploration of the appropriations that occur between groups in a country. 3 . Buai, the cult, is capitalised to distinguish it from the betel nut. 4. Cyclones have great power and are also thought to deposit bones from the dead under certain trees, l nese can be found and used in langarol. 5. Ideally, this should be collected from a protected place, such as irom behind a house, since those in the open do not shake so much. 6. Lesep (M) is the usual term tor 'tight but this is not applied to me lagas because it describes ngnt entailing action. To kill something or someone is referred to as i sepamet (he/she strikes something dead). An alternative word lamamau (M), or lamama, is employed to describe the 'fight' that lagas have in their skin - thus the lagas are said to have lamamau at lagas. Sometimes people say it inheres in their bones as well. This is an embodied form of power, inherent in an object or being - for example some trees are said to have this kind of power. 7. It is for this reason that they are invoked m lighting and protective magic, some oi wnicn is sun m use toaay. One of the magicians accompanying one of the dances I witnessed told me afterwards that the dance was protected by invoking lagas. 8. This designation of lagas as evil spirits and the use of their bones in dance objects and other dance-related magic has caused some church leaders to oppose dance performances at important church events. 9. In case my recourse to an examination of the metaphors used suggests a resurrection of the linguistic interpretations of material culture I criticise, it should be noted that there is a great difference between using a single linguistic lens to explain material culture and examining the spells that invoke specific effects for the material culture. 10. Should the langarol not start to shake, the magician may also try to initiate this by throwing it to the ground or by hitting it. Sometimes the langarol may not respond during this initial phase but may only start to shake part way through the dance. 261</page><page sequence="13">Material Culture and the Magical Power of Dance Objects REFERENCES ALBERT, S. 1987 'The Work of Marriage and of Death: Ritual and Political Process among the Lak, Southern New Ireland, Papua New Guinea', Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Chicago.
