<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evagrius Ponticus' Sententiae ad Virginem SUSANNA ELM INTRODUCTION The fourth century A.D. witnessed the emer- gence of an institution, monasticism, that was to become one of the most important formative elements within Christianity for centuries to come. The "shadowed places" created in the wake of this emerging institution proved to be as formidable as monasticism itself. One area still largely, if not en- tirely, obscure is a set of institutions that developed at the same time and in close connection with it: the institutions of female monasticism. While monasticism, true to Mary Douglas' words, "show[s] finely discriminated detail, which is closely scrutinized and ordered," and thus has been much studied and discussed, very little re- search has been done regarding the institutions of female monasticism, despite the light that has in recent years been shed on a number of aspects concerning female ascetics. What is perhaps even more telling is that what little has been done on the topic of the institutionalization of female ascetic life has been based on the premises provided by its male counterpart. Interpreted in this fashion, rather than as a process that occurred on its own terms and with its own merits, albeit in close con- nection and interdependence with that of male monasticism, the organization of female asceticism is more often than not found wanting. The fourth century A.D. witnessed the emer- gence of female ascetic life with its own organiza- tional structures and normative texts. Both the or- ganizational structures and, consequently, the nature of the normative texts regulating them dif- fer profoundly and increasingly from their male counterparts. This difference is most pronounced in the methods prescribed by the Fathers on how to achieve the essential aim of ascetic life. For a "Institutions create shadowed places in which nothing can be seen and no questions asked."' woman, the summit of ascetic life is the mystical wedding of her soul with her bridegroom, Christ, in the kingdom of heaven. A man, on the other hand, must seek his summum bonum through mys- tical knowledge of the divine, Y,vLotg rTO OEOO. The method of achieving the summum bonum and the organizational structures created to realize an ascetic life, and in consequence the normative texts regulating the process, differ. However, this differ- ence by no means implies that the Fathers of the Church considered the ascetic life of women to be of a lesser order. For the Fathers, the essence of ascetic life remains the same for men and for women: both strive in a constant progression to- ward the mystical union of their soul with the di- vine. In other words, the shadowy existence to which female ascetic life and its institutions have been condemned is less a result of the fourth- century Fathers and their writings than of subse- quent historical and historiographical develop- ments. Evagrius Ponticus' Sententiae ad Virginem, a text that has so far received very little scholarly atten- tion,2 are a prime example to illustrate the process described above.3 The Sententiae not only denote IM.

Tamburini, Quadernos Monasticos 36 (1976), 108-10; I have been unable to see either of these. 3The Sententiae ad Virginem (SV) and their parallel text, the Sententiae ad Monachos (SM), are referred to by Socrates: OTXlQ 1600.

Thus the Sententiae fulfill a function usually ascribed to a "rule."4 In this capacity, the Sententiae serve to demonstrate why this and similar texts addressed to women have been neglected, as have the organizational structures they regulated. In the case of the Sententiae, the reasons for their neglect lie partly in the biography of their author and his precarious position between orthodoxy and heresy, which did not allow his work to achieve its full impact on later generations. The more pro- found reasons for neglect, however, have to be sought in the specific character of fourth-century female asceticism and its relationship to the quite differently organized male monasticism, which created its own traditions and which has, as such, formed the central interest of scholarship.5 Evagrius Ponticus was born around 345, the son of Evagrius the Elder, chorepiskopos of the small town of Ibora in Pontus.6 His formative years were spent under the influence of the "great Cappado- cian Fathers," Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus, and their particular interpretation of the Nicaean doctrines, often called Neo-Nicaean.7 The teachings of Origen had in turn exercised a profound influence on Basil and Gregory. Indeed, during their first ascetic experiments at Annesi, they had compiled a collection of excerpts from Origen's writings, entitled the Philocalia.s Their as- cetic doctrine, however, had been strongly influ- enced by Eustathius of Sebasteia.9 Both Ibora's proximity to Annesi and his father's position led to Evagrius' early acquaintance with Basil of Caesarea and his monastic circle. Shortly before his death in 379, in fact, Basil himself or- dained Evagrius as a lector (&amp;vayv6orrlg).10 lum competentem religioni et sexui."

Our main source, chapter 38 of Palladius' Historia Lau- siaca, omits the period prior to and following Evagrius' ordina- tion and continues its report only after Basil's death in 379. The Coptic redaction of Palladius' chapter 38, ed. E. Amelineau, De Historia Lausiaca, quaenam sit hujus ad monachorum Aegyptiorum historiam scribendam utilitas (Paris, 1887), 104-24, contains a more fully developed biography than the Greek, based on a source equally known to Socrates, originating in all probability from someone acquainted with Evagrius at Cellia. The complex relationship between these two versions is discussed by A. Guil- laumont, Les "Kephalaia Gnostica" d'Evagre le Pontique et l'histoire de l'Originisme chez les Grecs et chez les Syriens, Patristica Sorbonen- sia 3 (Paris, 1962), 76 note 118. A letter written by Evagrius to the Caesareans, preserved as Ep. 8 of the correspondence of Basil of Caesarea (ed. Y. Courtonne, Saint Basile. Lettres I-III, Paris, 1957-66, here 1.22 [Basil's letter 8 corresponds to letter 22 in W Frankenberg, Euagrius Ponticus, AbhG6tt, N.F. 13, 2, Berlin, 1912, 581]), led W. Bousset, Apophthegmata. Studien zur Geschichte des iltesten Monchtums (Tibingen, 1923), 335-41, to conclude that Basil not only ordained Evagrius as a lector, but enrolled him as a member of his monastic community at An- nesi. In this letter (in some mss. that attribute it to Nilus [PG 79, cols. 1315-16] it bears the subtitle "to some monks"), Evagrius speaks of his sudden flight to Constantinople, prima facie caused by an unexpected event that left him disturbed, presum- ably Basil's death, but also by a great yearning to learn the doc- trine of God and his philosophy. He asks the addressees to grant him some time, not because he is attracted by life in the city, but because he has found a teacher whose eager pupil he became, "acquiring the doctrine of God." In addition to letter 8, Bousset reaches his conclusion based on a quote by Mar Babai from Evagrius' letter, referring to the &amp;ytov aX Lta, and Mar Babai's reference to Tdiv jtovaXCov &amp;LDt0Cp in his commentary on the Kephalaia Gnostika 20-21 (Frankenberg, Euagrius, 822). Ac- cording to Bousset, Evagrius would have left this community for Constantinople shortly after Basil's death in A.D. 379, an em- barrassing move Palladius would have preferred to omit in his eulogy on Evagrius. Though plausible, considering Evagrius' close ties to Basil-"the column of truth"-this hypothesis has not been unanimously accepted, and we have to resign our- selves to the fact that our knowledge of this period of Evagrius' life remains incomplete; see also Soc. HE IV.23, PG 67, col. 520. Most modern scholars reject Bousset's hypothesis; see G.</page><page sequence="3">EVAGRIUS PONTICUS' SENTENTIAE AD VIRGINEM 99 In 380, now ordained as a deacon by Gregory of Nazianzus, Evagrius left his native Pontus to ac- company Gregory to Constantinople. Gregory had been more to Evagrius than just a superior. In- deed, Evagrius repeatedly refers to "the just Greg- ory who planted me," affirming the profound in- fluence that the great Cappadocian had on the young Evagrius' intellectual formation." The at- traction was mutual, for Gregory on his part ad- dressed Evagrius in letter 228 as his "beloved brother, ... who only recently has embraced the philosophical life," and mentioned him very favor- ably in his testament of 21 May 381.12 Evagrius had developed into a highly sophisti- cated member of the clergy. Not surprisingly, Gregory specifically recommended him to his suc- cessor Nectarius as an assistant in negotiating the highly charged doctrinal disputes of the synod in 381, since Evagrius was "most well trained in fight- ing (86taEXTLX6cTaog) all heretical doctrines" and a brilliant rhetorician.'3 In short, Evagrius' time in Constantinople began auspiciously. Yet only a year later his rapid rise came to a sud- den halt. The young deacon, then about thirty-five years old, had fallen in love with the wife of a high court official, who reciprocated his feelings. Before the scandal broke, causing irreparable damage, Evagrius was induced by a dream to leave the fol- lowing day for Jerusalem.'4 His sudden departure from Constantinople marked "la premiere phase d'une conversion a la vie asc6tique: rupture avec le monde et renoncement a la brillante carriere."'5 Upon his arrival in Jerusalem in 382 or 383, Eva- grius was received with great hospitality by Me- lania the Elder and Rufinus of Aquileia in their monasteries on the Mount of Olives.16 After a short period in which he reverted to his former "worldly" life-style, Evagrius succumbed to a grave and elusive fever that lingered for several months. Melania declared the illness to be yet another sign from heaven and persuaded Evagrius to renounce his former life entirely. Late in 383 Evagrius left Jerusalem for Egypt and the deserts of Nitria. In 385 he moved into the even harsher desert of Cellia, where he remained until his death in 399/400.17 Thus the former in- tellectual with a well-known inclination for luxuri- ous living,18 died at the age of fifty-four like a true Father of the Desert, in search of perfection and after a life of asceticism that was strict even by the standards of his day.19 Yet Evagrius' retreat into the desert did not re- sult in a complete annihilation of his former self. He soon became the focal point of a group of De- sert Fathers known as the "Tall Brothers," ItEYdhOL &amp;6VQEg,20 who were drawn together by their com- Bunge, Evagrios Pontikos.

Mar Babai further assumes that Ep. 46, 1 (Frankenberg, 597) was addressed to Gregory, in which case their correspondence did not cease even after Evagrius' subse- quent move to Egypt. Indeed, O'Laughlin, Origenism in the De- sert, 11-14, has most recently suggested that the 14- or 15-year- old Evagrius was one of Gregory's pupils upon the latter's re- turn from Athens.

The intellectual pursuits of these "for- eigners," combined with an increasing antagonism against Origen and his teachings in general, led to the exile of the entire group in 399-400. Evagrius was spared this fate only by his death, which oc- curred in the same year.21 Trained in the school of the great Cappadocians, Evagrius certainly differed from the majority of his fellow desert dwellers, most of whom were simple, illiterate peasants from the nearby villages of the Nile valley. As far as we know, moreover, Evagrius was the only one of the "Tall Brothers" group to express his ascetic principles in his own writings.22 The titles of his major works, the trilogy Praktikos, Gnostikos, Kephalaia Gnostika, and the treatises entitled Antirrhetikos, Of the Eight Evil Thoughts, and On Prayer, indicate that the subject of his literary work was the quintessence of his own life: the quest for the spiritual perfection, for knowledge of the divine.23 According to Genna- dius of Marseilles, Evagrius was the first to unite the practical and spiritual approach to ascetic per- fection and to incorporate both into an extensive and highly complex philosophical system. It is pre- cisely this system which led Bousset to characterize Evagrius as the "Anfainger der M6nchsmystik." 24 Although Evagrius' ascetic system exercised an immense influence on his contemporaries and fol- lowers,25 it has reached us only "dans des condi- tions particulieres."26 In fact, until the beginning of this century, Evagrius' work was virtually un- known. The reasons for this relative obscurity are only too familiar to those interested in the history of the Early Church. Evagrius' doctrine was pro- foundly influenced by the teachings of Origen. It was precisely during Evagrius' lifetime, the second part of the fourth century, that Origen and his teachings came increasingly under attack as being at the root of the "Arian heresy," to be formally declared as heretical in 553 at the fifth ecumenical council.27 Evagrius and his circle, which included Rufinus of Aquileia and Melania the Elder, were placed progressively on the defensive, until the last word was spoken: the anathema pronounced on them by the council in 553.28 esp.

Until recently, the Sententiae were known only in Rufinus' Latin translation, preserved in the appen- dix to Holstenius' Codex Regularum.33 In 1911 Dom A. Wilmart published an independent Latin ver- sion, entitled "Epistola Evacri ad virginem (di- recta),"34 and in the following year the first com- plete Syriac version was edited by Frankenberg under the title "Epistula ad virginem."35 In 1913 G. Gressmann published the first edition of the sole surviving manuscript in Greek, the original language of the Sententiae, under the title HQaCalveOLg TQ6g ]naQOVOv.36 This short overview of the Sententiae's textual tradition has already sug- gested one of the fundamental questions: exactly what kind of text are they? Are they a letter, as implied by Jerome, who uses the phrase "scripsit ad";37 a collection of sentences, of "stichera" or verses, a description used by Socrates;38 a collec- 29Guillaumont, Traitg Pratique (SC 170), 29-37. 30Evagrius' rehabilitation began in 1893 with O. Z6ckler's monograph, Evagrius Ponticus: Seine Stellung in der altchristlichen Literatur- und Dogmengeschichte, Biblische und kirchenhistorische Studien 4 (Munich, 1893). This work has not lost its fundamen- tal value, although most of Z6ckler's conclusions were drawn from the small selection of works contained in Migne's PG 40, cols. 1219C-1286A, which contains the following works: Capita Practica ad Anatolium, 1219C-1252C; Rerum Monachalium Ra- tiones, 1252D-1264C; Capitula XXXIII, Spirituales Sententiae, De Octo Vitiosis Cogitationibus, 1240A-1244B; Sententiae ad Fratres, Sententiae ad Virgines. Z6ckler's initiative was soon followed by a comprehensive Armenian study published in 1907 by H. B. V. Sarghisian, Vie et oeuvres du saint Pere Evagre le Pontique traduites du grec en arminien au Ve sikcle (Venice, 1907) (not seen by me), and in 1912 by Frankenberg's Euagrius Ponticus, an edition of a number of Syriac manuscripts, containing parts of all major works, the Kephalaia Gnostika, the Praktikos and Gnostikos, the An- tirrhetikos, and a collection of Evagrius' correspondence, includ- ing a long letter to Melania. As a result of these publications, Evagrius' opus received increasing attention. Attempts to re- construct his doctrine began in 1923 with Bousset, Apophtheg- mata, and R. Melcher, Der 8. Brief des hl. Basilius, and were fol- lowed in the 1930s by H. U. v.

Gressmann's edition, used herein, is based on the sole 13th-century Greek ms. thus far discovered, Barb. gr. 515. For the catalogue de- scription of this ms., see S. de Ricci, "Manuscrits grecs de la Biblioteca Barberina," Revue des BibliothUques 17 (1907), 81-125, here p. 118, no. V, III. The codex is characterized as "antholo- gia ex Veteri et Novo Testamento S. Basilii Magni homilia V ... Euagrii monachi capita varia, eiusdem parainesis ad monachos ..."; the SV are on fols. 65-68. Gressmann used Rufinus' Latin translation and Frankenberg's Syriac versions as a basis for his edition. The Greek text is shorter than the Latin and the Syriac versions, both of which contain a doctrinal passage in SV 54 that is missing in the Greek ms. Gressmann, 144, remarks with re- spect to this passage: "In pr. 54 ist ein ldngeres Glaubensbe- kenntnis eingeschoben, daB die kirchlichen Dogmen gegen Ketzereien schutzen soll. Es ist ungefahr gleichlautend im La- teiner und Syrer zu lesen, fehlt aber noch im griechischen MS. Sein fremder Ursprung wird zweitens dadurch bestiitigt, daB es den Zusammenhang sprengt, und drittens dadurch, daB ihm die eigentumliche Form des Parallelismus membrorum fehlt ... ." However, as J. Muyldermans, "Evagriana. Le Vat. Barb. Graec. 515," Le Musion 51 (1938), 208-14, concludes, this dogmatic passage was original and was later deleted by the translators, though the existence of an identical passage handed down in both Latin and Syriac, without a common Greek source, is difficult to explain, especially since the Greek codex is much younger than the Latin or the Syriac ones. Muylderman argues that the dogmatic aspects conform with Evagrius' sys- tem, an argument adopted by G. Bunge, "Origenismus-Gnos- tizismus.

The Sententiae begin with a quasi- liturgical evocation (SV 1-3): Love your Lord and he will love you, serve him and he will enlighten your heart. Honor your mother [in the same way] as the mother of Christ and do not ir- ritate the one, now white-haired, who has borne you. Love your sisters as the daughters of your mother, and do not stray from the path of peace. Taken literally, "do not irritate the one, now white- haired, who has borne you (SV 2)" could imply that the parthenos' community was her natural family.41 However, addressing the sisters as naQOtvoL, or virgins, and exhorting them to love one another as if they were related, Evagrius leaves little doubt as to the Sententiae's intended audience: they are ad- dressed to an ascetic community. The mother is a mother in the spiritual sense; her daughters are born in a spiritual rebirth. This ascetic community lived within a village or town, and the sisters, although they observed the strictest possible seclusion, did occasionally come into contact with the outside world. Virgins visited the local church (SV 33); the virgin addressed is repeatedly exhorted to avoid all contact with men (SV 6, 7, 46); she "must not see the feasts of drunk- ards nor visit the weddings of strangers" (SV 14), since "the chants of demons and of flutes weaken the soul and diminish its strength" (SV 48); and she must not "mingle with women [xoo?tLxal] who are still in the world" (SV 24). Three kinds of women are particularly reprehensible: those who mock others and make jests (SV 49);42 a virgin "who touches a man" (SV 44),43 perhaps a syneis- akte; and, finally, yQaCv xvxhEvovoCov, old women who wander around (SV 13). Considering the warning (SV 26) against "the desire to walk about and the longing to visit the houses of strangers," Evagrius seems to recommend strongly what could be described as stabilitas loci.44 In contrasting the virgin to xoaotxa( (SV 24), lit- erally "those in the world," Evagrius leaves little doubt that the virgin, by virtue of her status as naQ0tvog, falls into an entirely different social cat- egory. "This" world with all its commitments such as marriage and the rearing of children-the world xoo~tLx6g is frequently used in the narrower sense of "married"-is no longer hers. She already inhabits a world of another kind, ruled by differ- ent norms of behavior.45 The virgin's community was guided by the "mother," who had to be honored as the "mother of Christ." "Mother," or Coptic amma, was at that time a title frequently used in reference to the leader of a community of naeQOvoL.46 Here, how- ever, Evagrius adds another nuance. The "mother" should be honored like the "mother of 39J.

Unfortunately, this indirect al- lusion to Mary is Evagrius' only one; it is thus not feasible to draw further conclusions, beyond per- haps that Mary is evoked as a symbol of perpetual virginity.47 In any case, all members had to obey the "mother" at all times without murmuring (SV 20, 21, 45). Equality, not only with regard to obedi- ence, was essential for the life in community. All property was owned in common-"do not say: this is mine and that is yours, because in Jesus Christ everything is in common" (SV 30). Furthermore, to slander or despise a weaker sister, to occupy one- self overly with another's life, or to "exalt yourself on account of your noble birth" was strictly to be avoided (SV 29, 31, 32). Theoretically, the past, the "world" with its social distinctions, had to be, if not forgotten, at least consciously obliterated. To enter the community meant to adopt a new identity and presumed a definite, lifelong decision to abide by the obligations connected with this new identity. Though no vow is mentioned, the whole tenor of the Sententiae indicates that to "become" a nact0vog, a member of this community, implied a lifelong commitment.4s In spite of the community's striving after equal- ity, the full spectrum of social classes was repre- sented. The best efforts could not erase a lingering consciousness of former social distinctions. The sisters had hand- or waiting-maids:49 "Do not say: the maidservant annoyed me and I am going to punish her, because there is no slavery among the daughters of God" (SV 12). Clearly, the community included servants, and it appears that these maids were not considered to be "fully" equal members of the community, a situation Evagrius may have intended to rectify. Consisting of a mother, daughters or sisters, and serving maids, the community was structured ac- cording to a precise hierarchy modeled after the oixog or the familia.50 Just as in a household, mem- bers of the community obeyed the mother, lived with their servants, and fulfilled their specific function, all benefiting from the household's com- mon property. Although individual poverty was a fundamental requirement for the status of cnaq0vog, the community as a whole owned prop- erty. The virgins, as a community, financed their housing as well as generous acts of charity by their own work, at least partially (SV 4, 17, 32, 36,43). Once she became a member of this "family," the virgin had to adhere to certain basic requirements regarding food, work, prayer, and external ap- pearance. Abstinence, work, and prayer were the practical foundations of a life directed toward peace, mutual charity, equality, and obedience. Peace or equanimity was perhaps the most funda- mental prerequisite for life in common: "The Lord loves the gentle virgin, the quarrelsome will be hateful to him" (SV 19). And further: "She who secretly slanders a sister will remain outside the bridal chamber and no one will hear her crying at the door" (SV 42). Indeed: "A gentle wife is better than an angry and enraged virgin" (SV 45). Anger and rage, 6oQyf and Ovti6g, together with avarice, envy, jealousy, and gloating (SV 11, 28, 31, 36), are the most difficult obstacles a virgin must overcome to achieve the much-desired tranquil soul: "Anger and rage ought to be far from you, and rancor (tlyovxaxa) must not rest in your heart" (SV 8). "Envy (4)06vog) lays waste to the soul, and jealousy (flk?og) devours it" (SV 28). Ev- agrius, however, also provides the virgin with pos- itive advice to overcome all of these vices: "Love banishes anger and rage, gifts avert rancor" (SV 41); and only "the foolish virgin loves money, whereas the wise one gives even her own bread away" (SV 36, and 17, 43). Because "hunger and thirst diminish evil de- sires" (SV 40), 3yxQdtcta, abstinence, together with love and generosity, becomes an essential ally in overcoming all adverse emotions, especially those that might endanger chastity. There are many warnings to avoid all conceivable situations that might lead to contacts with the opposite sex (SV 6, 7, 44, 46). Beyond doubt: "Abstinence (iyxgQdtLa) 47 See Athanasius, Lettre aux Vierges, in L.-Th. Lefort, S. Athan- ase.

Food was restricted. Evagrius did not specify the exact diet to be followed except that normally it was vegetarian: "to eat meat is not good (xaX6v) and to drink wine not the best (&amp;yaO6v); you must give all of these to the weak amongst your sisters" (SV 10).51 While the times of the meals are not stated, nor do we know whether meals were held in common, Evagrius recommends regular meals: "Do not say: today I shall eat, tomorrow I shall not eat, because you will not do so in wisdom. It will harm your body and hurt your stomach" (SV 9). Continuous exhortations to fast, emphasized by many laudable exempla, abound in the ascetic liter- ature. At the same time, it is worth noting that vir- tually all writings addressed to virgins stress the need to do so in moderation or, to use Basil of Cae- sarea's words, to preserve T6 v yxQaTrECa E rovov. Excesses are never condoned, because they distort the God-given harmony and divert the focus of the virginal life toward merely bodily concerns.52 Thus abstinence from food, despite its merits, must never be overdone: "Do not despise your sis- ter when she eats and do not boast with your own abstinence, because you do not know the Lord's wishes and who will behold the Lord" (SV 50). On the whole, the sisters' day was characterized by a certain routine: "Let the rising sun see the Scrip- ture in your hands, and, come the second hour, your work" (SV 4). While again the precise nature of the work is not mentioned, it clearly holds an important position within the ascetic routine. Its fruits, as has already been noted, were owned by the community.53 The most important aspect of the daily routine, however, was prayer: "Pray incessantly and con- stantly remember (iXptvrloo) Christ who created you" (SV 5). The essence of prayer is in its constant nature. It is an uninterrupted remembrance, vir- tually a "meditation" on Christ, day and night, transcending yet underlying all other activities (SV 15, 35).54 However, despite the continuous nature of prayer, a specific "time of prayer" and a time for vigils were set aside (SV 6, 25, 40).55 During these times, the sisters sang psalms and visited the church of the Lord (SV 33, 35). The most effective form of prayer, however, took place at night, in sol- itude and with tears (SV 25), performed in all sin- cerity with a "pure heart," from which all evil thoughts and "false images" had been removed (SV 6, 38, 40).56 Merely moving the lips was not sufficient (SV 35). Abstinence, work, and uninterrupted, pure prayer-this harsh life could easily lead to sadness (X,6xl) or, even worse, &amp;xr6ia. 'AxjrlCa, "indiffer- ence," an affliction peculiar to the life of an ascetic, is difficult to translate.57 The most vivid and psy- chologically astute description of this particular state of mind and its symptoms is given by Eva- grius himself in chapter 12 of his Praktikos:58 The demon of &amp;xrlxla, also called the noonday de- mon, is the most oppressive of them all ....

In short, it uses ... every device it has to make the monk abandon his cell and give up the race. "Sadness is oppressive and indifference unbear- able," but, again, Evagrius prescribes the appro- priate remedy: "to cry before God is better than both" (SV 39). Tears had a special significance, if shed not out of sadness, but while praying "before God" (SV 39 and 25).59 Laughter was not permit- ted (SV 22, 46, 49). It was shameful, foolish, and an entirely superfluous expression of sentiment. Moreover, it created a noise quite unbecoming to constant prayer as, for that matter, did talking.60 A virgin ought to remain silent, except for uttering a "word of God" (SV 15, 33). In short, the virgin had to maintain a thor- oughly controlled countenance and avoid every possible source of distraction. Her eyes should not wander, especially when she left the house, (SV 33), which she was supposed to do as rarely as pos- sible, and ideally only to visit the church of the Lord. Apart from facilitating the complete immer- sion into prayer, seclusion also helped to avoid van- ity. "She who adorns her dress is bereft of pru- dence" (SV 23). Any vestige of vanity might cause the virgin to regret the ideal virginal beauty for which she had to strive: silent without a smile, eyes cast down, dressed poorly, and subjected to con- stant work, with a face marked by frequent tears, careworn and thin because of lack of sleep and fasting.61 Only those who were truly determined could find the lifelong motivation to sustain this kind of beauty: "She who is sad about her blood- shot eyes and the wasting of her flesh will not de- light in her pure, passionless soul" (SV 51). "A pure, passionless soul" is the true aim of a virgin's life. The practical prescriptions regarding the control of a virgin's body were solely means to the end of the perfection of her soul. Without that, all other attempts at salvation remained futile, be- cause they were undertaken for entirely the wrong reasons-glory among men: "Do everything for the sake of the Lord, and do not strive for glory among men, for the glory of men is like a withered flower, the glory of the Lord is everlasting" (SV 18). Everything had to be done for the glory of God, since only the Lord truly "knows a virgin's heart and observes all her thoughts" (SV 33). A virgin's soul, therefore, had to be pure, devoid of all evil thoughts and desires, resounding with uninter- rupted prayer without any infringement or hin- drance: "As the fire's blast is hard to control, so is the wounded soul of the virgin hard to heal" (SV 37). Free from hunger and thirst, no longer troubled by avarice, fornication, sadness, anger and rage, indifference or akidia, jealousy and envy, never boasting or gloating,62 a virgin will always be continent, charitable, free from any attachments to this world, merciful and gentle, loving, obedient, and humble. She will achieve the aim and quintess- ence of virginal perfection: total liberation from passion, &amp;06dOta (SV 31), the precondition of pu- rity: "The kingdom of heaven is &amp;hd6eta of the soul" (Pr. 2). Without a doubt, purity of the soul, more essen- tial to ultimate perfection than bodily purity, is harder to achieve and much easier to lose. Even at the very last stages of perfection, dangers lurk and vigilance should not be slackened: "I have seen men who corrupt virgins with their teachings, thus rendering their entire virginity worthless. You, daughter, listen to the teachings of the Church of the Lord and allow no stranger to divert you" (SV 54).63 Only "the just will inherit the light, the im- pious will inhabit the darkness" (SV 54). In at- the Praktikos (Oxford, 1987), translates Xujl5 as "depression" and xxl6Ca as "listlessness." I do not always follow their sugges- tions for translating the specifically Evagrian terms. 59B.

First, the creation: God created everything and de- lights in the fruits of his labor; second, the nature of evil: noth- ing, not even the demon, is evil by nature, but God created evil out of his own free will. The third subject, christology, is thus summarized: Christ was born as a human being, but without sin, and he was not just an apparition in the eyes of men; and finally, eschatology: there will be a resurrection of the dead, the world will come to an end, and we will be clad in a spiritual body.

In fact, the virgin's decision to join the commu- nity equals the betrothal of the "daughter of God" to her heavenly bridegroom, whom she awaits, clad in virtue like a pearl in a golden setting (SV 47). Her entire life is but a preparation for the heavenly wedding (2 Cor. 11:2). This summit of virginal life will, however, be reached only after the virgin's death. Only then will she find fulfill- ment in the union of her bridegroom, Christ, an occasion for which Evagrius composed a vivid epi- thalamium, modeled after the Song of Songs:65 The virgin's eyes shall behold the Lord, her virginal ears shall hear his words. The virgin's mouth shall kiss the bridegroom, her senses shall be drawn to the sweet smell of his perfume. Virginal hands shall touch the Lord, and he shall delight in the chastity of their flesh. The virgin's soul shall receive the crown, and she will live with her bridegroom for ever after. She shall be clad in a spiritual garment, and she will feast among the angels of heaven. Her lamp shall be shin- ing forever, the oil in her vessel will never be ex- hausted. She will be showered with everlasting riches, and she will inherit the kingdom of heaven. (SV 55) My words to you, daughter, are said; your heart may keep my utterances. Remember Christ who guards you, and do not forget the worship of the Trinity. (SV 56) To summarize, the Sententiae regulate the com- munity's internal life and its contacts with the out- side world. They allow us to discern the principal model according to which the community orga- nized itself: the family, reflected both in the ter- minology used to address the community's mem- bers-mother, daughter, sister-and in its hierarchical structure. None of the Sententiae's pre- cepts differ from those contained in other writings aimed at regulating the life of a virgin. Rather, Ev- agrius simply brings many of the same issues con- cerning the life of a virgin in community into sharper focus. The community addressed by the Sententiae in- cluded at least one woman of "noble birth," EuyEvlg, the addressee, as well as members from other social strata, including servants. Indeed, members of the community remained quite con- scious of their "worldly" social differences, a fact Evagrius does not explicitly criticize either. He simply exhorts the "noble" members not to use the privileges of their rank. The virgins enjoyed a large degree of financial autonomy, and lived within a village or an urban center. This last fact, despite the virgins' almost complete seclusion, led to contacts with the outside world, with all the accompanying dangers of chat- tering old women, weddings, and even regular vis- its to church.66 The external circumstances re- Le Museon 103 [1990], 27-41), combined with the tenor of the doctrinal passage, led Muyldermans and Bunge to accept the passages as Evagrian. Bunge, "Origenismus-Gnosticismus," 31- 35, further attempts to identify a distinctly gnostic opponent because of the emphasis on the divinity of all creation; this is in line with Bunge's attempts to characterize Evagrius not so much as an Origenist but an anti-Gnostic, otherwise soundly based on Nicaean teachings. 64For the "mother of Christ," see note 45; for the wise and the foolish virgins in Origen, see A. Feuillet, Le Cantique des Can- tiques, Lectio Divina 10 (Paris, 1953), 64. 65 Ever since Meth. Symp. 7, 4, 158-59 (ed. H. Musurillo, Mith- ode d'Olympe. Banquet, SC 95, 18) the motif of the virgin's es- pousal with Christ, based on Isa. 62:5, has become a common- place in the literature "on virginity"; Orig. Comm. In Canticum Prol. and 2, 15 (W. A. Baehrens, Origenes Werke, GCS 33 (Berlin, 1925), 61-88 (= PG 13, col. 193); 0. Rousseau, Origtne. Home- lies sur le Cantique des Cantiques (SC 37), 7-55. Athanasius, Lettre aux Vierges, 77-80, also uses the Cant. as the model for his de- scription of the ideal virgin; see esp. H. Crouzel, Mariage et vir- giniti selon Origene (Paris, 1962), 25-39, 66-73; L. Abramowski, "Sprache und Abfassungszeit der Oden Salomos," OC 68 (1984), 80-90, esp. 86 f; E. A.

W. Drijvers, "The Odes of Solomon and Psalms of Mani," in Studies in Gnosticism and Hellenistic Religion Presented to G. Quispel (Leiden, 1981), 117-30; J. Flemming and A.

Lattke, Die Oden Salomos in ihrer Bedeutungfisr Neues Testament und Gnosis, Ia (Freiburg-Gottingen, 1980). 66There are only allusions to the economic life of the com- munity. Evagrius' SV corroborate an observation gained from virtually all sources referring to ascetics who lived a settled life in a community: the most fundamental ascetic requirement, namely, to renounce the world, was not carried to its extreme except by the most radical ascetic movements. To renounce one's property did not necessarily lead to absolute poverty, and while the individual member had to forgo personal luxuries, the community as such could at times own substantial proper- ties, often received as donations, as implied by the existence of a virgin of "noble birth." Most of the leaders of female commu- nities known to us belonged to an elevated social class, for ex- ample, Macrina and Emmelia, Vetiana, Olympias, or Ammoun's wife. On the opposite end of the social spectrum, most ascetics mentioned had maids, servants or indeed slaves, in clear defi- ance of Gal. 3:28 or SV 12 itself. Basil of Ancyra referred to maids in chap. 29 of his De Virg.; Macrina, Emmelia, and Am- moun's wife lived with servants; the "foolish virgin" in Pach- omius' female community performed slave work; and even Al- exandra, enclosed in her tomb, had her servant, although</page><page sequence="11">EVAGRIUS PONTICUS' SENTENTIAE AD VIRGINEM 107 ferred to in the Sententiae thus also strongly resemble those of other female communities as de- scribed by Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil of Caesa- rea, in Athanasius' letters to virgins, in Palladius' Historia Lausiaca, and in the canonical literature.67 Finally, the fact that Evagrius addressed his Senten- tiae to that community attests its close ties to a fig- ure of authority, Evagrius himself. III The Sententiae ad Virginem are not a continuous treatise or a cohesive discourse. Their only dis- cernible structural elements appear to be the intro- duction, which has an exhortation to love and honor the Lord, the mother, and the sisters, and the conclusion, which has three parts: the re- minder to adhere to the correct doctrine, the epi- thalamium, and a final sentence exhorting the worship of the Trinity. Other than that, Evagrius assembled a series of sentences or paraineseis with- out any apparent sequence, order, or connection between them. The sentences are characterized by parallelismus membrorum, with the customary con- junction xaC, at times accentuated by an explana- tion introduced with yd6. Their advisory nature is enhanced by the frequent use of the imperative: "do this," "do not do or say that."68 Thus, from a stylistic point of view, the Sententiae are most remi- niscent of a literary genre known as x&amp;Eidkatov or "chapter." 69 Evagrius was probably the first Christian author to employ this literary genre.70 Yet the use of sen- tences or x&amp;EIXcat in gnomic literature is no Eva- grian innovation. Developed by the Stoics, the form of the x&amp;Eidhaov, or collection of short, au- tonomous sentences, was considered the most ap- propriate way to facilitate meditation, because its concise, almost terse style prohibits fluid, discur- sive reading. Instead, it offers "chaque jour, au ha- sard du rouleau ouvert, une pensee se suffisant a* elle-meme et de nature a* nourrir leur meditation ... Vous devez renoncer, deis le premier numero, a y trouver un ordre logique."71 Is the same true for the Sententiae ad Virginem, or is it possible to discern some structure, some underlying principle of composition? This ques- tion is difficult to answer.72 Interestingly, despite the apparent absence of any immediately recogniz- able order, the individual sentences and their sub- division into 56 sections of two lines each have re- tained the same sequence in all surviving manuscripts.73 Indeed, it is Evagrius' doctrine which reveals a much clearer picture of the Senten- tiae's composition. Evagrius' thought reflects a long philosophical tradition, comprising Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic elements,74 particularly as they had been ex- slavery continued to be a controversial issue, as SV 12 and dis- crepancies in the opinions of Basil and the two Gregorys indi- cate; HL 5 and 34 (11.21 and 98); HM 22 (Festugieire), 128; VSM 7:6-8 (164); see Elm, Organization and Institutions, passim. 67 For details see Elm, Organization and Institutions, passim. 68K.

Other works employing the same technique are, e.g., Marcus Aurelius, Meditations; Ep- ictetus, Manual; Porphyry, Letter to Marcella; Hadot, "Exercices spirituels," 67 .f. 72Numbers, which according to Evagrius' own testimony in the prologue to his De Orat., PG 79, col. 1165; trans. Bamberger, Praktikos, 53-55, played an important part in his doctrine, do not seem to provide an insight into a potential structure of the SV If the last three sentences were to be considered as some form of an appendix, the core part of the SV would form the number 53, "and fifty-three is a combination of triangular and spherical, because twenty-eight is triangular and twenty-five is spherical ... [So you have] the wise knowledge of this world, which resembles the number twenty-five, because of the spher- ical nature of time, which rolls on from year to year...

The case is different with the SM, where J. Driscoll, in his as yet unfinished dissertation in theol- ogy (Gregoriana, Rome), has discovered the numerical prin- ciple of their composition; equally unsatisfying, however, are assessments such as Lackner's, Profane Bildung, 23 note 39: "Die literarische Form der Sentenzen des Monchs- und Nonnenspie- gels braucht hier, weil nicht von der Rhetorik bestimmt, nicht behandelt zu werden."

Hadot, "Les divisions des parties de la philoso-</page><page sequence="12">108 SUSANNA ELM pounded earlier by Clement of Alexandria and, above all, Origen. According to Evagrius, Chris- tian doctrine consisted of three essential parts, each constituting a successively greater advance- ment toward spiritual perfection: "Christianity is the teaching (86yta) of Christ our Savior, consist- ing of practical science (nGQaxt?x4), natural science (4vomx4), and theological science (0EoXoymxff)" (Pr. 1). The last two components, "natural science" (?v- oaLxi) and "theological science" (0EoXoyx4), are the essentials of a single concept, the "science of the divine," which Evagrius also defies as yvwoLxrj. In essence, therefore, Evagrius' tripartite division of Christian doctrine consists of two parts only, tQsax- rLx4 and yvwoauxrl. These two notions, EQaxTulx and yvwouxil, or in their more detailed form, EQpaxTuxrl, 4voLx, and EookoyL?x, are the foundation of Evagrius' en- tire system and, as such, possess a specific, techni- cal meaning. To identify the specifically Evagrian understanding of these terms, it is most useful to begin with a familiar aspect: their tripartite nature. According to Seneca, "philosophiae tres partes esse dixerunt et maximi et plurimi auctores: mor- alem, naturalem, rationalem"-in Greek, voaL- x6v, TIOLx6v, XoyLx6v.75 From the first century A.D. onward, these "classical" disciplines acquired a new meaning. Rather than denoting a simple di- vision, physics, ethics, and logic began to signify progressive levels of knowledge that are equivalent to a spiritual progress leading to the ultimate con- templation.76 It is this sense of spiritual progress that leads to reevaluation of the divisions 4voLx6v, 1tOLx6v, and, instead of logic, ntotnE(ea-the tech- nical term used to describe initiation into the high- est mysterion in Eleusis.77 Thus the highest possible degree of knowledge now assumes distinctly mys- tical characteristics.78 It was Origen who explicitly equated these three stages-4 oLx, 1Ox1, and ntontte(a-with the three levels of a Christian's spiritual progress: "L'6- thique, selon lui, assure la purification pr6alable de l'ame, la physique, en r6v61ant la vanit6 du monde sensible, nous invite a nous en d6tacher, l'6pop- tique enfin ouvre a l'ame purifi6e la contemplation des r6alit6s divines."79 Origen further established a direct link between these three parts of philo- sophical knowledge and the three Books of Solo- mon. According to him, Proverbs aided in achiev- ing ethical purification, Ecclesiastes revealed the vanities of the physical world, and the Song of Songs introduced the soul to the contemplation of the divine through spiritual love.80 Evagrius' intellectual debt to Origen is evident in his adoption of the tripartite nature of spiritual progress. Evagrius developed the concept further by substituting praktiki for ethics, and thus attrib- uting the mystical propensities of epopteia to 0Eo- XoyLx' or yv oLg rzou 8Eo03, the science of the di- vine. To begin with the first step, what precisely did Evagrius understand by tQpaxuLxl? "Practical sci- ence (ncgaxtLxl) is a spiritual method ([t0Oobog flve1tauLx?) which purifies the passionate part (ntaOprlx6vv ttog) of the soul" (Pr. 78). By the fourth century, the term tQaxTLx?, or QaxTtLx6g I(og, had assumed a specific, Christian meaning.8' phie dans 1'Antiquit'," Museum Helveticum 36 (1979), 201-23; I.

He now considers nQ?axLxrl to be an essential part of mon- astic life: nQaxTLxrl signifies the ascetic's exercise of five precise virtues, listed, for example, in the Sen- tentiae ad Monachos 3-5 and in the Prologue to the Praktikos: The fear of God (6(30og) strengthens faith (T(omLg), children, and is in turn strengthened by abstinence ('yxQdrteLa). Abstinence is made unshakable by per- severance (itnoitovA) and hope (,kthg), and from these is born passionlessness (hadOELa), whose offspring is charity (,ydnl); and charity is the doorway to natural knowledge (yvoEcog UvotLxTg), which is followed by theology and supreme beatitude ([axagLt6Tlg). (Prol. 8) The practice of these virtues-faith, fear of God, abstinence, perseverance, hope-is nothing but the ascetic's fight against unwanted thoughts, Xoy- LOaiol, because "... demons prefer to fight men of the world (xooItxol) by means of things, but monks they attack for the most part by means of thoughts (XoyLtool)" (Pr. 48). The essence of nQeaxtLx4, therefore, is the dis- covery of these thoughts, an analysis of their char- acteristics, and the employment of appropriate remedies to ensure their final conquest. These evil thoughts, XoyLOwo( and 8LaXoyLopo(, as well as their propensities, are engendered by demons. In fact, the link between the thought and the demon who causes it is such that they are virtually synon- ymous: the thought is the demon personified.83 While, again, not the originator of these con- cepts, Evagrius first distilled the theory of evil thoughts into a fixed system of eight generic thoughts, thoughts that in turn comprised all other evil sentiments: There are eight generic [evil] thoughts, in which every thought is contained. First, that of gluttony (yaotQL- [a~Qy(a), then, fornication (noQvEla), third, avarice (thaQyuQ(a), fourth, sadness (kOnr), fifth, anger (6QQyi), sixth, indifference (hx6ba), seventh, vain- glory (xEvo6o?(a), eighth, pride (14r'Eggav(a). (Pr. 6) These eight generic thoughts have to be counter- acted with the appropriate remedies. Fasting and abstinence (iyxxdtELa)84 counter gluttony and for- nication, love overcomes avarice and depression. Angry thoughts, however, whether those within the monk's soul or thoughts directed against oth- ers, require three remedies: gentleness, compas- sion, and charity (Pr. 20-26). Likewise, the monk has to employ three remedies against that most difficult vice, a'xrj6(a or indifference: tears (Pr. 27), perseverance, that is, stabilitas loci (Pr. 28), and a constant vigilance over his soul, "as if he were to die tomorrow" (Pr. 29). The last in the hierarchy of demons are those of vainglory and pride, which attack the monk after all the others have been overcome, but humility and the remembrance of past failures guard against these two (Pr. 33). This system of eight vices and their remedies reappears in the same sequence in virtually all of Evagrius' writings dealing with monastic life, the Sententiae ad Monachos, the Antirrhetikos, Against the Eight Evil Spirits, and others.85 In short, the system occupies a central position in Evagrius' ascetic doc- trine and had a tremendous impact on following generations in the form of the "seven deadly sins." 86 The monk may achieve the "flower of practical life," the absence of passions or hndOELa (Pr. 81), solely through constant watchfulness over the three parts of the soul in which evil thoughts act, namely, the part of instinctive desires or icnLOevrL- cifically religious meaning to cXTLX?, when he described the ascetic life led by Jacob as a gaxTLX6g 3log; Philo, De praemiis et poenis 51, ed.

As such, "&amp;d6Osa is what we shall call the soul's health" (Pr. 56), a state in which the soul has achieved "harmony and mutual ad- aptation" (Pr. 89).88 Once the soul has achieved this state of perfect harmony, it is able to love with truly pure love, &amp;ydrl, which in turn opens the "door- way to yvwxong," or the science of the divine (Pr., Prol. 8). Passionlessness, &amp;ndOsta, is the precondition for love, yydmrlj, which in turn leads on to the ultimate goal of monastic life, yvwortaxl, or a spiritual sci- ence.89 It, therefore, did not mean "to become like God or like a stone," as insinuated by Jerome, nor was it an end in itself.90 The true aim of practical life was not solely the absence of all passion, but pure love, aydrl, with- out which yvjotg o00 6Eo00 remains impossible.91 Love alone guarantees &amp;dOEsta and hence the achievement of the summum bonum, the mystical connection with the divine through yvaLotg.92 This brief summary has sought to emphasize the three essential steps comprising Evagrius' ascetic teachings: (1) nrQaxTxlx, the conquest of the eight evil thoughts through their remedies, culminating in freedom from passion and true love; followed by (2) knowledge of the physical world; leading ul- timately to (3) knowledge of the divine. How are these essential steps, with their equally essential components of the five virtues and the eight evil thoughts, represented in the writings discussed here, the Sententiae ad Virginem and the Sententiae ad Monachos? Evagrius composed the Sententiae ad Monachos as the male equivalent to the Sententiae ad Virginem. Their parallel nature, which is attested to by simi- larities in style and content as well as by verbatim quotations, was well known to Evagrius' contem- poraries, who always mention the two Sententiae as forming a unit. Jerome, for instance, wrote to Cte- siphon: "Euagrius Ponticus Hiberita, qui scribit ad virgines, scribit ad monachos," and Rufinus trans- lated both writings into Latin.93 Evagrius opens his Sententiae ad Monachos with a brief address to the heirs of God, the monks, ex- horting them to listen to his words, so that they may pass on his wisdom to their "sons," or dis- ciples, an opening similar to that of the Sententiae ad Virginem. This exhortation is immediately fol- lowed by the description of the five virtues, listed in the same order as in the Prologue to the Prakti- kos: "faith,"' "fear of God," "abstinence,"' "persever- ance;' and "hope" (SM 3-5). After this brief theo- retical definition of the most important virtues, Evagrius sketches a rough outline of his concept of nEQaxtxLX: a description of the eight vices-glut- tony and fornication, avarice and anger, sadness and indifference, and finally vainglory and pride-together with their remedies, arranged ac- cording to the tripartite division of the soul.94 He then proceeds to describe more concretely the monk's daily life, furnishing a doctrinal outline that includes a warning against heretics, and con- cluding with an expose on the "science of nature" as the precondition for the final steps in the ascent toward the "science of the divine," yvwoixj. 87For a detailed study of Evagrius' anthropology, see O'Laughlin, Origenism in the Desert, 127-37; for the complex de- lineation of soul (voIg-XoyotX6v), see esp. 153-86. 88Aristotle, Phys.

As in the Praktikos, Evagrius incorporates the eight generic vices or evil thoughts in their set sequence, combined with their appropriate reme- dies essential for attaining a~nd68E.95 Here the congruence between the Praktikos and the Sententiae ad Monachos ceases. While the Prakti- kos is concerned with the first preparatory steps, leading toward a6ndOELa, the Sententiae ad Monachos intend to guide the monk along the entire, long path to spiritual perfection: Evagrius proceeds by advising the monk on the two subsequent steps, yv6wotg )voLTx and yvtalg Tzo0 0Eo0. Thus the most substantial portion of the Sententiae ad Mona- chos is devoted to yv6oLg Tzo 0Eo0.96 Indeed, as a detailed analysis of its structure reveals, the entire Sententiae ad Monachos is composed around a center of six sentences discussing yv6oLg and aydxtry, the fundaments of Evagrius' entire system.97 In short, the Sententiae ad Monachos contain Eva- grius' entire ascetic system in a concise form: from the first step of ntQaxtuLxi, via the recognition of God's wisdom in nature, to the final aim, the cli- max of ascetic perfection found in the mystical union of the monk with God.98 However, the pro- cess was a slow one; the mystic depths of true yvaotg were revealed only to the very advanced monk after many trials and much striving.99 In- deed, the most profound depths of mystical knowledge could only be achieved after a monk's death. In contrast to the Praktikos, the Sententiae ad Mon- achos, and indeed all other relevant writings, the Sententiae ad Virginem do not include the system of eight evil thoughts and their appropriate reme- dies. This is not to say that the generic vices with their corresponding virtues are completely absent. As demonstrated above, Evagrius in effect alludes to all of the vices and their remedies. SV 39-41 refer to sadness and indifference and their appro- priate remedy, tears, and warn against fornication and anger which could be overcome by love, gen- erosity, and compassion. SV 36 condemns avarice, and once, in SV 38, Evagrius exhorts the virgin to prevent 6takoylowot; tovroL from entering her soul. Further, the highest aims of the praktiki, apatheia and pure love, form a definite part of the Sententiae ad Virginem. However, on closer analysis, the only vices men- tioned explicitly are those affecting the Ent0LOieJITlt- x6v and the OIt?Lx6v, the two lower parts of the soul: gluttony, fornication, avarice, anger, rage, sadness, and indifference. Vainglory and pride, the last vices preventing perfection, are missing. Further, in sharp contrast to the Sententiae ad Mon- achos, where the word occurs over thirty times, the term yv owg does not appear once, nor do any of the notions connected with yv 6otg play any role whatsoever in the Sententiae ad Virginem. 95To repeat the remedies once more, yXQddTE a against for- nication, tydncrl, love and charity, as remedy against Cdoog or anger. SM 12-15 deal with rage and its appropriate remedies; 16-18 with avarice; 19-20 discuss humility as a remedy against arrogance; 24-29 stress the incompatibility of wealth and the above-mentioned virtues; 30-37 expound the aspects of 0u[t6g and suggest gentleness and compassion as remedies; 38-45 contain a description of negative consequences of yaorQtQtaQ- y(t. SM 55-60 give a brief description of &amp;x61(a, its nature, relation to depression, and the delight of the monk who suc- ceeded in overcoming it; 61-62 warn again against vainglory and pride by giving a brief description of them; and 63-73 con- tain a series of advice on how to avoid them. 96The following figures give a merely numerical impression of the importance given to yv6o;g in SM: the word occurs 30 times altogether, 4 times as yvCOL;g To 08eoO, 3 as yv6outg hlk9OEcag. Xol(a and q?6vqOtg each occur 8 times, but &amp;OELta, which was so important in Pr., only 4 times. 97SM 63-68; Ev. Pr. 1 (SC 171), 499; idem, In Ps. 24, 16 PG 12, col. 1272; J. Driscoll, unpub. diss., Gregoriana. 98The Praktikos forms one part of a trilogy completed by the Gnostikos and the Kephalaia Gnostika, as pointed out by Evagrius in his Letter to Anatolios, which forms the prologue to the Prak- tikos: "we shall now expose, concerning the bios praktikos and the bios gnostikos, not all that we have seen and heard, but only that which we have been instructed by them [the masters] to divulge to others; we have condensed and rephrased ta praktika into 100 chapters, and ta gnostika into 50 and then further into 600," Guillaumont, Traite Pratique, Prol. 9 (SC 171), 492-93. The sec- ond part, the Gnostikos (Guillaumont, Le Gnostique [SC 356], 17- 23), is a form of transition between the Praktikos and the Kepha- laia Gnostika (ed. A. Guillaumont, Les six Centuries des Kgphalaia gnostica d'Evagre le Pontique, PO 28 [Paris, 1958]), which inci- dently have only 540 chapters (6 x 90); Guillaumont, Les "Ke- phalaia Gnostica," 18-22. What consequences result from this conspicuous absence of yv6otg and all its related notions in the Sententiae ad Virginem? Did Evagrius abandon the concept of spiritual progress so fundamental to as- cetic life when addressing himself to women? Origen provides important clues in answering these crucial questions. It will be recollected that he was the first to equate the pure soul and its pro- gress toward the mystical contemplation of the di- vine with the three Books of Solomon.

In the Sententiae ad Virginem, Evagrius preserves the concept of the mystical ascent. What is more, the substance of ascetic life, its ultimate aim, also remains the same: mystical union with the divine. However, in the case of women, the nature of this summit is entirely different, presented with en- tirely different topoi, and achieved by an entirely different method: mystical union with the divine is achieved not through gnasis, but through a heav- enly wedding with Christ. For women, the summit of ascetic life is conceived in sexual terms, as the everlasting wedding of the virgin's soul with her heavenly bridegroom in the bridal chamber of the kingdom of heaven. Thus, even though the aim of ascetic life, namely, mystical union with the divine, is ulti- mately the same for men and women, there can be no doubt that the nature of this union and the means of achieving it are understood and repre- sented as different. A monk strives for an intellec- tual abstraction, namely, mystical knowledge. On the other hand, the fulfillment of a virgin's ascetic life is far more personal and concrete: it is union with the heavenly bridegroom, Christ. Conse- quently, in the Sententiae ad Virginem, the XoyLoTL- x6v, or rational part of a virgin's soul, is not an issue. For women, the highest aim of ascetic life results directly from their status: as a virgin and only by virtue of her being a virgin, in the spiritual sense of the word, will she become bride of Christ. For a virgin, the sole "effort" necessary to achieve her aim is to preserve her condition. By definition, her ascetic efforts culminate in her attainment of absolute purity. According to Eva- grius' system, purity is the freedom from passion in both body and soul. In other words, a virgin's ascetic progress, at least while she is alive, ends with 6TndOELa and atydal: the aims of praktiki. FvworTxLX and its notions are of no concern to her. As a result of her capacity to achieve the highest aim of ascetic life, through a mystical wedding, she does not have to pursue the difficult path toward knowledge. Fv 6oLg tof OEof, the highest goal of a man's as- cetic life, is, according to Evagrius, virtually unat- tainable in its strictest sense during an ascetic's life- time. However, knowledge of the divine offers at least the theoretical possibility of achievement through an ascetic's own efforts, though these are always aided by divine grace. Therefore, a male ascetic can, theoretically, aim to strive for perfec- tion while he is still alive. But a woman's unio mys- tica, her supreme realm of perfection, can, by def- inition, be achieved only after her death. This differing conception of the aim of male and female asceticism runs through both Sententiae like a leitmotif. Whenever Evagrius portrays the re- wards of the monk's ascetic life (or its punishments in case of a lapse), he phrases those events in terms of the gain or loss of knowledge. The same circum- stances, in the case of the virgin, are portrayed as the gain or loss of intimacy with the bridegroom.'04 The difference is most striking in the eulogion pas- sage in both Sententiae, which in the case of the Sen- tentiae ad Virginem is composed as an epithalam- ium, a bridal chant, glorifying the final union with Christ, while in the Sententiae ad Monachos, it is a glorification of the merits of gnasis.s5 What is the significance of this remarkable dif- ference in the nature of ascetic perfection?

E. Marotta, "La base biblica della 'Vita S. Macrinae' di Gregorio di Nissa," Vetera Christianorum 5 (1968), 73-88, here 84-86, attempted to prove that the VSM followed the same tri- partite subdivision, but Maraval, Vie de Sainte Macrine, 93 f, de- nied such a close affinity. 10sSignificantly, elsewhere Evagrius used the Song of Songs only rarely, and did not write a commentary on it; G6hin, Les Scholies, 20. 104 See, for instance, SV 36, SM 18, SV 14, SM 43. 105 See also Bernards, Speculum Virginum, 185-95.</page><page sequence="17">EVAGRIUS PONTICUS' SENTENTIAE AD VIRGINEM 113 Sententiae ad Virginem could have been written prior to Evagrius' full development of his system of progressive perfection via praktiki to gn5sis, and thus prior to his molding of the eight evil thoughts into a fixed form.106 Yet this is unlikely, for the two Sententiae are evidently parallel, and both concur with the relevant aspects of the Praktikos and the Treatise on Prayer. 1'07 Further, Evagrius' approach to ascetic life was the same, whether one lived in an anachoretic way or in community. This is demon- strated by the Sententiae ad Monachos.s 08The Senten- tiae ad Virginem thus represent the only ascetic work where Evagrius alters the nature of the ascet- ic's summit, though its substance, mystical union with the divine, remains the same. The reason for the Sententiae's different concept of the fulfillment of ascetic life is the obvious one: they were ad- dressed to women. In substituting the mystical union with Christ, the bridegroom, for yv6oL g toU OEoo0, Evagrius aligns himself with an already existing tradition, though he adds his own specific "ingredients." The concept of the virgin as bride of Christ, and the corresponding notion of her life as a betrothal or even anticipated marriage, had by the end of the fourth century become the most widespread defi- nition of a woman's ascetic life.'09 In contrast, most of the earlier fourth-century writings that stress the notion of the virginal soul as Christ's future bride are addressed to tnaQtOvoL: male as well as female ascetics. The bridal notion was evoked re- gardless of gender in a substantial number of texts, whether canons, letters, or treatises. Indeed, one of the most common similes compares the Church to Christ's virginal bride."01 During the fourth century, however, ascetic life as an engagement to Christ progressively became attached to females exclusively."' The reasons for this change are complex, as are its implications."2 There appears to have existed a direct link to an increase in the institutionalization of female ascetic practices as a whole. To become a bride reflects the normal course of a woman's life, and the transfer of this concept to a spiritual level serves a dual purpose. Christ as the prospective bridegroom is a powerful incentive for the choice of ascetic life. In contrast to other, more radical interpretations of asceticism, this view does not conflict in the least with traditional norms of a woman's position in society. Thus, as the bride of Christ, a woman may find ascetic fulfillment while remaining an integral part of society: though she already inhabits a different world, she remains part of "this world." Second, the fulfillment of a woman's ascetic life was perceived as an event a posteriori, occurring only after her death. By this definition, she could never attain perfection in this life, an achievement that might have substantiated her claims to an un- duly important position within the congregation and thus within society. To give an example: while, as attested for Macrina, it was acceptable for an outstanding female ascetic to teach her fellow vir- gins, women's attempts to teach matters of doc- trine to men or, even worse, to the congregation, had always been one of the most feared aspects of female ascetic excellence, since it could lead di- rectly to the "usurpation" of clerical functions.11"3 Now, according to Evagrius, one of the essential aspects or tasks of the Gnostikos was being a teacher. Accordingly, yv6otg, or to become a yvwoaLx6g, was not a woman's goal.11"4 106This could be supported by Evagrius' use of the more elab- orate koyt[toot novqlol, rather than simply XoytotoC, when referring to a thought to be avoided; see note 83 above.

The absence of any notion of intellect in the prescriptions for virgins as com- pared to its respective abundance in those for monks implies that, according to Evagrius, intel- lectual pursuits were not considered appropriate for women. Women were to strive for a more per- sonal aim, that of a bridal union with Christ, rather than an abstract gn6sis. The latter was reserved for men, although, to underline the notion of essential equality, exceptions were possible for exceptional women. Thus the only occasion where Evagrius presents his doctrine of gn6sis without obscuring it "mystically" is in his Letter to Melania.115 The Sententiae are an interesting example of a larger development: as the topos of the virginal soul as bride became increasingly inappropriate for male ascetics, it acquired an increasingly exclu- sive female connotation. At the same time, new aims of a man's ascetic life were developed, intro- ducing different (and in this case additional) steps toward the ascetic ideal of perfection and union with the divine. IV Evagrius addressed one virgin throughout. Who was she? Why did Evagrius address one virgin only, but imply a community? The Sententiae ad Vir- ginem are a letter, yet they consist of a collection of sentences prescribing how a future bride of Christ ought to perfect her soul and body in community with other virgins. What was the function of these prescriptions, and what value did both author and recipient(s) attribute to them?16 Were they ob- served, and was the text repeatedly consulted? Ul- timately, the question arises whether the Sententiae are: "[un] crit... destined un groupe de moines ou de moniales et presentant un certain caractbre l6gislatif."117 The latter requires that the Sententiae should have had a certain impact beyond their im- mediate addressee, that they were consulted by later generations, and that they were general enough to apply to several communities.'gs According to our sparse knowledge of Evagrius' life, one virgin in particular had a decisive influ- ence on his ultimate destiny, a virgin with whom he maintained an extensive correspondence and remained in regular contact throughout the re- mainder of his life: Melania the Elder.119 A large number of his extant letters are addressed to Me- lania-among them the famous Letter to Melania- and his close relationship with her was common knowledge."12 Known to us mainly through the writings of Pal- ladius, Paulinus of Nola, and Rufinus, Melania the Elder certainly occupies an important position in the history of early monasticism.121 Born around the middle of the fourth century into one of the richest and noblest Roman families of Spanish ori- gin, Melania married young and was already wid- owed at the age of twenty-two. Only one of her three children, her son Publicola, reached adult- hood.'22 These personal tragedies might have in- duced Melania to renounce the kind of life to which she was accustomed and to lead the life of an ascetic, despite strong opposition from her fam- ily.123 Probably in November 372, Melania left Rome with a small party of companions en route to Alexandria. By 373 she had visited the famous desert ascetics in Nitria and Cellia together with Rufinus, her "spiritali in via comitem."124 In Egypt they both became involved with a group of Fathers who were shortly thereafter forced into exile to "5Guillaumont, Les "Kephalaia Gnostica," 51; see above, note 97.

Melania followed them and offered her financial support. These monks, disciples of Abba Pambo, were the so-called "hoi Makroi,"' the "Tall Broth- ers," precisely the group of Origenistic monks that was to become "those around Evagrius." '25 Prob- ably in 377-378, "after they [the exiled monks] were recalled, [Melania] founded a monastery in Jerusalem and spent twenty-seven years there in charge of a convent of fifty virgins." '26 Rufinus re- mained in Egypt until around 380, when he joined Melania in Jerusalem and became himself the guide of a male monastery.'27 Little is known of the organization of the mon- asteries of Melania and Rufinus.128s Most likely both monasteries were situated on the Mount of Olives, probably between the sanctuary of St. Helena and that of the Ascension.'29 Melania and Rufinus re- ceived numerous pilgrims as guests, treating the sick among them, and Melania gave financial sup- port to both foundations.'30 It is well documented that Rufinus and Melania frequently exchanged manuscripts, and it was Rufinus who translated most of Evagrius' works into Latin, the Sententiae ad Virginem among them.'1' Since Rufinus also translated Basil's rules into Latin, it has frequently been presumed "that this was at least the basis of the regular life followed by the monastic settle- ments of Rufinus and Melania."132 As G. Bunge has pointed out, at least four of Evagrius' letters, namely, 7, 8, 19, and 20, deal ex- plicitly with concerns of Melania's community. 133' In Letter 7, probably addressed to Rufinus, Evagrius states: "As regards the chaste deaconess Severa, I praise her intentions, but I do not approve of her undertaking. For I cannot imagine what she will gain from such a long journey, along such a labo- rious route." The "chaste deaconess Severa" was a member of Melania's community who wanted to undertake the strenuous pilgrimage into the Egyp- tian desert, apparently to visit Evagrius. Conse- quently, being opposed to such an undertaking, Evagrius exhorts Melania in Letter 8 to teach her "sisters and daughters" to refrain from such long journeys, because these are "alien to every soul that has retired from this world." In Letter 19, again addressed to Rufinus, Eva- grius writes: I would have wished to give something to the chaste virgin, which is useful for her life, but the impatience of the messenger did not allow me to do so. However, those things, which we have already composed earlier on through our Lord, we willingly handed to her, so that she may pray in her mind without interruption, may control her desires through abstinence, and mit- igate her anger through gentleness. In Letter 20 Evagrius addressed Severa herself: I was greatly pleased by your intentions, and I have admired your zeal for learning and delight in your progress....

As to the type of monastic observance ... we have very little infor- mation." O'Laughlin, Origenism in the Desert, 35, presumes that these monasteries were "co-educational." 129Pall.

See, the writing that we sent you will teach you the nature (T3tog) of these things, and it will let you recognize the "straight and narrow path" (Matt. 7:14). For it [the path] will lead whoever obeys through his deeds to the heavenly kingdom. The "writing" in question is undoubtedly the Sen- tentiae. '34 By the time Evagrius wrote Letters 19 and 20, and probably even Letters 7 and 8, he had already composed the Sententiae. Someone other than, but closely connected to, the original recipient specifi- cally requested Evagrius' practical and spiritual ad- vice-Severa. Originally, Severa had intended to seek out this advice from the "master" in person, but Evagrius objected. Instead, he sent a copy of the Sententiae. Severa was a deaconess, which im- plies a fairly prominent position within Melania's community in Jerusalem.135 The reasons for her request are unknown, but there can be little doubt that she regarded the Sententiae as a full substitute for the master's words.'36 The Sententiae ad Virginem were thus intended for Melania's community, and as Bunge has pointed out, the Sententiae ad Monachos for those around Rufinus.'37 These texts thus form the basis of ascetic life in both communities. That the lady "of noble birth," the original addressee, was Me- lania herself seems most likely, but this has ulti- mately to remain a matter of speculation. The Sententiae were consulted by more than one party, their precepts were considered binding, and they were intended for more than one person. Their precepts were of sufficient precision to allow a community to regulate its dealings with the out- side world and to organize its life within; they could provide guidance and thus ensure the con- tinuity of ascetic practice and spiritual develop- ment, independent of the presence of the original founder and guide of the community. 138 In fact, even in its details the content of the Sen- tentiae concurs with many of the prescriptions laid down in the slightly earlier or contemporary writ- ings that are usually characterized as rules.'39 These writings are, primarily, Basil of Caesarea's Letter 22, his Regula Moralia, and the Regula Mon- astica, translated into Latin by Rufinus in 397; Pachomius' rules, translated shortly thereafter into Latin by the latter's then opponent Jerome;140 and Augustine's prescripts for male and female ascet- ics, composed around 395/7.141 Basil's Letter 22, the Regulae Brevius Tractatae or shorter recension of his rules, and Augustine's Letter 211, 5-16, the Regularis Informatio or his rule addressed to 1'4A fact already noted by I.

In fact, the com- piler of the epistles' Syriac ms., Mingana 68 (fols. 61a-88a, A.D. 1902, a modern copy of an old ms. of unknown age from the monastery Deir Za'faran, Bunge, Briefe, 168), inserted the SV immediately after Ep. 19; Bunge, "Origenismus-Gnostizismus," 36. 135A.

S' The SV's advice does not contradict the little that we know of the practices in Melania's community. The Scriptures stood in high regard, with prayer and strict, but not overly severe, abstinence being of paramount importance. Work was pre- scribed, and the lack of information concerning the economic situation of the convent in the Sententiae ad Virginem may well be explained by Melania's financial position. Seclusion was not ab- solute; according to Egeria, in Jerusalem visits to the local church were customary, Pall. HL 54 (11.146, 158); Per. Aeth. 28, 38, 41 (SC 21), 214, 238, 244; Gordini, "Il monachesimo," 89. Both Melania's community and that depicted in the SV empha- sized generosity, hospitality, and caring for the sick (cf. SV 9, 10). The description of Melania's outer appearance agrees with that recommended to the addressee of the SV. Melania's spiri- tual beliefs are not known to us, apart from her intellectual pur- suits, which she based firmly on the writings of Origen and the Cappadocian Fathers, and her belief in the primacy of poverty and service. 139De Vogde1, "Les regles monastiques anciennes," 12-17, and bibliography, pp. 8-10. 140Translated in 404; Bas.

All three writ- ings are letters, originally addressed to one specific community, containing short precepts based on scriptural counterparts, often without any appar- ent order, and apparently written to answer direct requests from the ascetics concerned.142 Their pre- cepts reinforce a hierarchical structure, regulating the behavior of individual ascetics toward each other and their superiors. They specify the times of prayer, work, the consumption of meals, and comportment with regard to the opposite sex. Vir- tually all the texts mentioned begin with an exhor- tation to live "harmoniously" together with the other members of the community, to obey, and to share all possessions. All texts are, of course, shaped by the author's fundamental concepts re- garding the aims of ascetic life, the correct method for their achievement, and list retributions or pun- ishments in case of default."43 The profound difference between these writings and the Sententiae, however, is the nature of their distribution. There is no evidence to demonstrate that the Sententiae were consulted by a sequence of later generations or that the Sententiae were widely distributed to other communities. These aspects are directly linked to the fate of Evagrius and the communities of Melania and Rufinus. During the 380s Melania, Rufinus, Evagrius, and Jerome were among the most influential ascet- ics of their time. Melania especially was the "nobi- lissima mulierum Romanarum," comparable only to the famous Thecla, who, according to Jerome, possessed "inter Christianos nostri temporis vera nobilitas."'44 Evagrius, who arrived in Jerusalem only in 383, became famous for his superior con- cepts of ascetic practice soon after he settled in Ni- tria and then Cellia, attracting fellow ascetics as well as visitors from afar, "so that his cell was filled daily with five or six strangers ... Many sent him donations so that he had more than 200 pieces of silver deposited with his oixov6[og, who served him constantly in his abode."145 Evagrius, together with Rufinus, was Melania's spiritual companion, and he was known as such beyond Egypt and Pal- estine.146 Only about thirty years later, in 417, another as- cetic called Melania arrived in Jerusalem. She was Melania the Younger, Melania the Elder's grand- daughter.'47 Neither upon her arrival nor during her fourteen-year sojourn in Palestine did she ever stay in her grandmother's convent. In fact, her biographer Gerontius never once refers to Melania the Elder and her foundation, although Palladius assures us that only seven years earlier, on the oc- casion of Melania's death in 409 or 410, "having disposed of her possessions, she fell asleep within forty days, in good old age ... leaving behind both a monastery in Jerusalem, and the endowment for it." "s Gerontius' general silence on the subject of Melania the Elder is more than mere chance.'49 Far from simply suggesting a discontinuity in Melania the Elder's monastic foundation, Gerontius bears testimony to the fate of Melania and her circle, which included Evagrius-a veritable damnatio me- moriae. As has already been indicated, the history of Evagrius and Melania the Elder's circle is intrin- sically tied to the so-called Origenistic crisis, which ended in 553 with the anathema of Origen and his followers, explicitly including Evagrius.'50 This crisis lasted roughly from 393 to 403, orig- inated in Palestine, and progressed from there to Egypt.

One centered around Epiphanius and included Jerome, Bishop Theophilus of Alexan- dria, and eventually those Egyptian monks called "anthropomorphic"; they opposed Origen and his teachings. On the other side were Evagrius, Rufi- nus, Melania, Bishop John of Jerusalem, Isidoros of Egypt, the "Tall Brothers," and other Origenis- tic monks. In 393 Epiphanius had forced the issue by demanding an open condemnation of Origen's teachings, which supposedly lay at the root of Ari- anism. Jerome, an old acquaintance of Epiphanius, accepted the latter's condemnation, whereas Rufi- nus dismissed it. Matters soon escalated to a com- plete rupture between Jerome and Rufinus. They were not reconciled until 397, when Rufinus de- parted for Rome.' 51 The crisis intensified in 399 in Egypt. At that point, Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria, a staunch supporter of the Origenistic monks, gave in to the threats of their opponents, the "anthropo- morphic" Coptic monks, and switched sides.'52 He called a synod in Nitria, which, allegedly "pro- tected" by armed forces, condemned Origen and his teachings and forced the "Tall Brothers," to- gether with approximately three hundred monks, into exile in Palestine and Constantinople.153 Je- rome and the anti-Origenistic faction, thanks to Theophilus, had remained victorious. Evagrius died on New Year's Eve 399/400. Me- lania was about to return to Rome.1'54 Jerome, how- ever-perhaps because of his own, at one time quite fervent Origenism-had a long memory.'55 In 414, writing against yet another "Origenist de- viation," Pelagianism, he fervently attacked Eva- grius and Rufinus, and erased all passages in his Chronici Canones where he had once praised Me- lania: now he referred to her as one "cuius nomen nigredinis testatur perfidiae tenebras." In short, his former close friends and allies had become his worst enemies. As Gerontius attests, this was a con- demnation only very few dared to withstand.156 Considering these circumstances, Evagrius' Sen- tentiae could hardly have had an impact much be- yond the community to which they were originally addressed. Though Melania's community contin- ued after her death in 410, and the Sententiae's pre- cepts were observed after Melania's return to Rome around 399-400, thus ensuring continuity in the sense of the now absent founder and leader, whoever dared to use or mention them after 399 would have been branded an Origenist and here- tic. Who could admit to being influenced by the Sententiae in the face of Jerome's verdict, not so much against Evagrius, but against Melania her- self? Neither Melania's nor Rufinus' community could have expanded, and all traces of their conti- nuity were erased. This examination of the Sententiae's actual func- tion has been based on the criteria proposed by Dom A. de Vogdie as fundamental in defining a writing as a monastic rule: namely, a text's norma- tive value; its capacity to regulate the internal or- ganization of a community and its relations to the outside world; the possibility of identifying an underlying social model, such as a corporation or a family; and a text's authority as demonstrated by 151 In Easter of 393 Epiphanius himself came to Jerusalem to cure the bishop, John, from his "Origenistic" errors. A public 6clat ensued with Epiphanius preaching against John and John against the "anthropomorphists" in each other's presence. After his return to Eleutheropolis in 394, Epiphanius ordained Je- rome's younger brother, Paulinian, as priest with the intention of having him officiate in Bethlehem, at Jerome's monastery. Bethlehem was, however, in John's diocese, and John had not even been informed, much less given his consent. When he re- fused to accept Paulinian's ordination and the accompanying Origenist accusations, Epiphanius retaliated by asking the Pal- estinian monks to break with John. In a countermove, John ex- cluded the Bethlehem community from his Church, a de facto excommunication. As a result of this strife, John's lifelong friendship with Jerome came to an end; John even attempted to have Jerome deported from Jerusalem. Thanks to the media- tion of Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria and Abba Isidoros, things never went quite that far, and in 397 reconciliation was achieved; according to Soz. HE VIII.15 (GCS 50), 1553, Epi- phanius knew none of the Origenists personally; he received all his information from hearsay. 152Theophilus had apparently incurred financial difficulties and was about to be exposed by his close advisors, the Origenist desert fathers Isidoros, Ammonios, Eusebios, and Euthymios; now, motivated as much by his need to placate the anthropo- morphist desert fathers as by his wish to curb Isidoros' increas- ing influence, he changed political and doctrinal sides, a volte- face neither Jerome's nor Epiphanius' purely doctrinal entrea- ties had been able to bring about.

De Voguii excludes them because they are addressed to one virgin only, and others consider that the literary classification of the Sen- tentiae as a letter containing sentences or paraine- seis, or at best as a Speculum Virginum,159 is in itself sufficient to exclude them from being a rule.'60 As de Vogii pointed out, literary genre alone is an insufficient criterion for inclusion into or exclusion from another literary genre like that of the rule, which itself is still in the process of formulation during our period.'16 Further, to quote Berger, "eine Gattung kann auch lediglich durch ihr Ver- hialtnis zum Kontext und durch ihre Funktion darin bestimmt sein." 162 Now it has been demonstrated, based on their content, the authority of their author, and the re- peated consultations by their recipients,'63 that the Sententiae did exercise all the functions commonly associated with a rule. However, the issue is not to include the Sententiae at all costs into this category (though one might easily conclude that this is where they belong). It is rather to ask what reasons led to their exclusion. These reasons are difficult to identify because of the overwhelming impact of one factor: the dam- natio memoriae of a group and its monastic foun- dations declared heretical. However, other factors also played a part. As has been said, the Sententiae fulfilled virtually all criteria associated with a rule with the exception of their distribution among other communities and documented acceptance by more than one generation. The latter criterion, continuity in time, however, has been prevented not by a shortcoming of the text itself but by external circumstances. This leaves the criterion of distribution.1"4 This cri- terion, apparently so decisive in classifying the Sen- tentiae, is of particular relevance in highlighting a problem inherent in the entire discussion of texts regulating the organization of female ascetic life, and thus in our understanding of these organiza- tions as a whole.

The issue is further complicated by the distinc- tively "prescriptive," gnomic nature of the genre of "sentences," and the catchall function of the genre of "letter." None of the authors of the other rules mentioned regarded their precepts as rules. Augustine thought of his precepts as a "libellus"; only Eugippius explicitly called them a "rule" (in contrast to Eva- grius, whose contemporaries were well aware of the fact that he had written to monks and virgins), and Basil never thought of his Ascetica other than in terms of "advice." It was Gregory of Nazianzus who characterized them as 6QoLg yQcrol-og xat xa- v6otv, written "rules" and canons; Aug. Ep. 211, 16, 2 (CSEL 57), 370 = Praeceptum 8; Eugippii Regula (ed. F.

J. C. Guy, Jean Cassien, Institutions cdnobitiques, SC 109, Paris, 1965, 64-70, 92-94). See De Vogfie, "'Sub regula vel abbate,"' 212-20, for the "surprisingly perso- nal character of many early rules"; also idem, "Les regles mo- nastiques anciennes," 20-22. 164Despite Rufinus' Latin translation and the independent tradition edited by Wilmart, they were not circulated widely in the West, although the Syriac and Armenian translations indi- cate a certain popularity in the East.</page><page sequence="24">120 SUSANNA ELM and others, presupposes a very specific organiza- tional model, that of a male monastery-a monas- tery consisting of a "main" complex, such as An- nesi for Basil, Tabennesi for Pachomius, the White Monastery for Shenoute, and subsequent filial foundations.' 65 The writings considered rules for these communities developed their now extant form precisely to cater to such an organizational development: to ensure equal practices in all filial foundations, regulate contacts with the central monastery and its superior, establish a set hier- archy among the various superiors, and so on. Regulations regarding women always occur in the context of these larger organizational structures. Basil's, Pachomius', and Shenoute's foundations all had a "female" branch, regulated either by a fe- male transcript of the rule or by additions address- ing issues arising directly from the presence of "sisters." None of these rules address a female foundation in its own right.166 Here the Sententiae differ. They are specifically addressed to a community of women and reflect at the very least the author's concept of how a female community ought to be organized. Now, as far as I am aware, none of the fourth-century female as- cetic communities had filial foundations. As I am showing elsewhere, female asceticism at the end of the fourth century was organized in a multitude of different ways, although most often in small, loosely structured communities surrounding a specific founding figure, with members often being relatives or close friends.'67 It is to such in- dividual communities and their leaders that the Fathers address their writings regulating ascetic life, most often in the form of letters and treatises On Virginity. In other words, the third criterion proposed by de Vogfie and others cannot be applied to female communities, because it is a reflection of an under- lying organizational model that is predominantly male. Women organized their ascetic life differ- ently, and this is reflected in the normative writings regulating it. However, this by no means implies that these writings were not considered to be of the same normative character as the "rules," or that these specifically female forms of ascetic organiza- tion were considered to be of lesser value. Again, Evagrius' Sententiae are an important ex- ample. Quite clearly, for him and in his way of understanding, the ultimate aim of an ascetic life was the same for men and for women: mystical union with the divine. However, the nature of this mystical union and the ways to achieve it differed according to one's sex: one was a more abstract no- tion, the other a more concrete one; one was gn5sis, the other a heavenly marriage. Nowhere does Ev- agrius imply that a mystical wedding with the di- vine bridegroom represents a mystical union of a lesser order than that achieved via gnrsis. Male and female ascetics may achieve their common goal in a different fashion, both as far as practical organi- zation and spiritual progress are concerned, but ultimately their standing was the same, since "in Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female." '68 University of California, Berkeley 165 Some rules included in the corpus were addressed to one community only: the second Rule of the Fathers, the Rule of Paul, and, significantly, the female rules of Caesarius and Do- natus; de Vogtii, "Les regles monstiques anciennes," 20. The vast majority is addressed to communities as here described; for Shenoute see Elm, Organization and Institutions, 173-81; for the fundamental difficulties the "real in den Orden vorfindlichen Wertorientierungen und Zwecksetzungen zu erkennen," see, e.g., G. Schmelzer, Religiise Gruppen und sozialwissenschaftliche Ty- pologie. M6glichkeiten der soziologischen Analyse religibser Orden, So- zialwissenschaftl. Abhandlungen der G6rres-Gesellschaft 3 (Berlin, 1980), quote on p. 191. 166Basil's and Pachomius' prescriptions for women form part of their overall opus addressed mainly to men, and Augustine's rule for nuns is a later female adaptation of the Praeceptum, the male version; see Verheijen, La RNgle, II, 186-206; Lawless, Au- gustine of Hippo, 135-48 and 152-54, for the date of the female version, perhaps before 423. 167 If they are connected with male organizations, it is often in the form of double monasteries, founded by a brother and a sister or by two friends, and if this original structure then ex- pands, it is on the male side only; see also Elm, Organization and Institutions. 16 I deal with the methodological implications of the above in greater detail elsewhere; see also Elm, Virgins of God, forthcom- ing; and C.
