The Evolutionary Problem as it is To-day. By Sir Bertram C. A. W in d l e, F.R.S. (Herder. 1927. 4s. ']'HiS article has been suggested by the books cited above ; but its purpose is not to determine and criticise what science teaches concerning evolution that may be done in a second article. Neither is its purpose to anticipate the judgment of the Church on any current theory of evolution. Its purpose is simply to explain those doctrines of Catholic theology, already defined and therefore unchangeable, which have to be safeguarded before any theory of evolution can be embraced by a Catholic. The first point to be noticed is that the Church has nowhere condemned the general principle or theory of evolution. There are, as far as I am aware, no words of Pope or Council which involve the Church in any formal and direct opposition to this theory. Hence she retains the fullest liberty to embrace any conclusions of science that are clearly established that are not mere hypotheses or ingenious guesses. The idea that theologians are in a sort of panic-stricken conspiracy to close their eyes and the eyes of others to truths of the natural order, or that they hold scientists to the obligation of suppressing or distorting facts, is extremely silly. Is it not obvious</page><page sequence="2">272 Studies [JU141M that they could not, even if they would, prevent the discovery of such truths Is it not also obvious that they cannot fear the discovery of such truths unless their own faith in the truths they preach is really " sicklied o'er with the pale cast of doubt " But though the attitude of theology towards evolution is none other than that of patient expectancy, it would be insincere to deny that many forms of the hypothesis or theory, are in open conflict with certain definitions of faith. These definitions concern God and nature. They assert about God and His creatures certain things that simply cannot be reconciled with, let us say, the materialistic 600ism of Haeckel. Nay, they cannot be reconciled with the teaching of many scientists far more moderate and reputable than Haeckel. All these teach some form of pantheism, and pantheism means that there is no personal God, no survival of the soul after death, no freedom of the will in this life, and consequently no morality or human responsibility. The Church has at various times clearly defined what kind of God it proposes for our worship; but nowhere more clearly than in the last Ecumenical Council, which was held in the Vatican 186 9-18 70. I cannot do better than cite its words :--- The Holy, Catholic, Apostolic, Roman Church believes and confesses that there is one true living God, Creator and Lord of heaven and earth, omnipotent, eternal, immense, incomprehen sible, infinite in intellect, in will, and in every perfection, who, being one, singular, entirely simple and unchangeable spiritual substance, is to be proclaimed distinct from the world in reality and essence, supremely happy in Himself and of Himself, ineffably exalted above all things. This unequivocal teaching is reinforced by four canons, which anathematize (1 " any one who denies that there is one true God, Creator of all things visible and invisible " ; (2 " any one who dares to assert that there is nothing but matter " ; (3 " any one who asserts that</page><page sequence="3">1928 Evolution and Catholic Doctrine 273 the substance and essence of God and of all things are one and the same " ; (4 " any one who says that finite things . . . . have emanated from the divine substance, or that the divine essence becomes all things by self manifestation or evolution, or that God is being universal and undefined, which, by determining itself, constitutes the sum of things divided ' into genera, species, and individuals." The Vatican definitions not only repudiate all existing errors such as those of Hobbes, Hume, Spinoza, Hegel but all conceivable enunciations of the materialistic or pantheistic hypothesis. All these theories run counter to the whole current of Catholic theology and not less to any sound philosophy. Atheism is the bankruptcy of reason, and pantheism is atheism veiled. The ac300tance of either leads logically to a denial of the validity of our reasoning processes, and ultimately to a denial of any absolute truth. With this denied, we find ourselves like athletes wrestling in quicksand; for the very terms we use have lost their significance.They have become the empty chatter of evolving apes. Hence, ironically enough, those who pretend to prove that we are merely evolving apes, prove by this very fact that their proofs are valueless. In other words, if one ac300ts the hypothesis that thought is nothing more than molecular movement in the grey matter of the brain, then it becomes impossible to establish any system of epistemology which will give us episteme or knowledge. It matters little that the learned authors of these theories do not see this ; for the quarrel of the philosophers and theologians with them is just that they are not keeping within the bounds of their science, but are wandering into fields of speculation where they have no authority and no competence. It has often been said, and must be repeated, that no biologist or zoologist or palaeontologist, while keeping within the sphere of his science, can pronounce on first origins or final ends. In doing so he becomes immediately a</page><page sequence="4">274 Studies [JUNE metaphysician usually while deriding metaphysics as a fossil science of the Dark Ages. But the Vatican Council tells us something more about God :---- This only true God, in His goodness and omnipotent power, not to increase His own happiness or to acquire new perfection but to manifest His own perfection by the good things He bestows on creatures, did freely create from nothingness, in the beginning of time, both forms of creature spiritual and material namely the angels, the world, and finally man. . And this teaching is confirmed in the following canon : If any one doers not confess that the world and all things contained in it, both spiritual and material, have been produced, in their entire substance, from nothingness by God ; or if anyone maintains that God did not create by an act of will free from all constraint, but on the contrary was under the same necessity to create that He is to love ; or shall deny that the world was created for the glory of God, let him be anathema. Hence we see that, if any evolutionary hypothesis denies explicitly or implicitly the dogma of the creation of all things by God, it is irreconcilable with the Catholic faith. This point is perhaps the one which needs most consideration from us at present; for it is one about which most misunderstandings are abroad. It pleases anti-religious writers to deride as naive and absurd the Church's teaching on creation. They speak of it as entirely based on the early chapters of Genesis. For them the com600 teaching of Catholic theologians is that God assumed unto Himself hands, took the slime of the earth into these hands, and then proceeded to knead the bodies of our first parents as a child might knead figures out of plastocene. To show that I am not exaggerating, I shall cite a passage from the second of the books placed at the head of this article. The writer is the Rev. James M. Wilson, D.D., F.G.S., Canon of Worcester. Think of the orthodoxy of creation a century ago. There is in the Worcester Cathedral Library, a600g our early printed books, a copy of the Nuremberg Chronicle, a Histor of the world</page><page sequence="5">1928 Evolution and Catholic Doctrine 275 from creation downwards. The primaeval void is represented by concentric black circles, with a Hand stretched over them. In the next page the Creator is shown as an old man modelling Adam out of clay, with animals standing round. Adam is finished down to his waist, and alive ; the rest of his body is a formless lump of clay. I show this book sometimes to visitors, as Boswell tells us it was shown to Dr. Johnson, and they smile. But let us remember that this represented both the orthodoxy of the whole Church and the science of naturalists till the lifetime of some of us (italics mine).' These would be strange words from any reputable writer; but coming from a doctor of divinity and a canon of Worcester they are just bewildering. , I presume Canon Wilson would admit that St. Augustine pertains to the tradition of orthodoxy of the whole Church, and that he died in 430. Yet St. Augustine mentions this con300tion of creation only to set it aside as too puerile for discussion. So did the Fathers in general, and so did St. Thomas Aquinas and the Scholastics. After all, if an artist ventures to paint God in the act of creating man, he must represent Him in corporeal form and with human lineaments as Michelangelo has done in the Sistine Chapel. I have no doubt that the author of Genesis was quite conscious of the anthropomorphism of his descrip tion. But could he have written otherwise for a primitive people There is plenty of anthropomorphism in the first lessons of religion given by a mother to her child. Indeed a certain amount of anthropomorphism is inevitable in all descriptions of God's relations with man. The Vatican Council teaches that God created all things from nothing and in time. Hence primordial matter is not eternal. Theologians have discussed the question whether the world could have been created from eternity; but they have never reached unanimity on this subtle point. The view of St. Thomas is that reason cannot prove the repugnance of the idea. St. Bona venture, on the other hand, held the idea to be repugnant. Evolution in the Light of Modern Knowledge, p. 488.</page><page sequence="6">276 Studies [JUNE But this question need not detain us. The Church teaches that, as a matter of fact, creation took place in time or rather creation inaugurated time, which is the pries et posterius of created things. But how. did God create All things and in all their varieties at once by a single act . of .His omnipotent will Or primordial matter first, and then later the different divisions of matter stars, planets, earth, seas, plants, animals, man with all their various genera and species fixed for ever Or did He endow primordial matter with inherent power to evolve into the vast and ordered universe of animate and inanimate things That is a problem which has long exercised the ingenuity of philosophers and theologians. If we exclude the soul of man and the question of miracles, it is safe to say that the Church has made no definite pronouncement on the problem. But there are implications in her doctrine, and we must be careful not to draw wrong deductions. To whatever solution we incline in our speculations, we must safeguard the transcendence of God, the absolute depen dence of all creatures on Him, the spirituality, freedom and immortality of the human soul. But whether the passage from inorganic to organic, from vegetable to animal, from animal to human body requires each a direct intervention of God all these are questions for the philosopher, working on the data of science, to explore. On such questions the Church rarely pronounces, and then only when an opinion is proposed which jeopardizes some theological truth. Hence there is a large liberty left for theistic theories of evolution. If the evolutionist presupposes the creation of primor dial matter, the speculative theologian is not concerned with his theories until man becomes involved. For the theologian man is altogether sue generis-immeasurably transcending the nearest approach to him in the animal kingdom. And yet he is in part an animal. In meta physical terminology he is defined as "a rational animal."</page><page sequence="7">1928 Evolution and Catholic Doctrine 277 Theology has never denied the animality of man or his bodily kinship with the beasts. Indeed it has often been charged with over-insistence on this side of our nature. But it has never failed to balance this concession by equal insistence on the transcendence which reason and soul give to man. The human soul is spiritual and immortal. The theory of evolution which does not safeguard this doctrine can find no toleration in the schools of Catholic theology. But can theology tolerate the hypothesis that God did not immediately fashion the bodies of the first man and woman, but rather prepared an animal body through some evolutionary process and then infused into this body a spiritual soul I am not asking if this is scientifically proved (for it is not), or if this is ever likely to be proved. I am only seeking to clear up a tangled problem by a series of theoretical questions. Once more I cannot see that such an hypothesis imperils any dogma of Catholic doctrine. We have now reached the crucial point of the problem. The preachers of the evolutionary gospel would regard all hitherto said as the reluctant concessions of theology to modern science, ' and they would regard it as insufficient and illogical. For them man in his totality, body and mind (they abstain in general from the word " soul "), is only the most advanced of the primates. He has more mind than the 600keys, because he has a larger brain pan. But that there is a specific difference between human and animal intelligence, and above all that this difference imports a spiritual and unique principle in man this they hardly deign to examine. The superiority of man's intelligence they do not question; but for them this superiority implies nothing more than a difference of degree, not of quality. The difference, however, is so great that it creates an embarrassing problem, and this problem they try to solve by postulating millions of years for the evolution of the human . brain. We might</page><page sequence="8">278 Studies [JUNE object that this solution can hardly be called scientific ; it puts too great a, tax on our credulity. But the real objection is that the spiritual cannot naturally evolve from the material, whatever be the number of years you allow for the process. A reader may ask: What about St. Augustine and his rationes seminales What exactly St. Augustine understood by his rationes seminales is disputed; but it is not disputed that he postulated, for the human soul, the direct intervention of God. A full discussion of the question and of its bearing on evolution will be found in . Father Michael J. McKeough's The Meaning of f the Rationes Se finales in St. Augustine (Washington, 1926). A few sentences may be quoted :-- Summing up the results briefly, we may say that Augustine held firmly to the theory of the creation of all things. The act of creation did not extend over a period of time, but occurred in a mathematical moment. At that moment all things came into existence : some in their proper forms, others only potentially. Included in the former were the four elements : earth, air, fire and water; and in the latter were all living things that were to appear in the course of time. . . . Augustine does not tell us in what order things appeared; but he does imply that they passed from their rations seminales directly to their own proper forms and that those forms are the same as those that existed in his own day. Thus he excludes transformism. Man's body was created potentially, like other things, at the beginning; but the power to bring it to actuality may have been retained in God. The great Doctor thus allows the possibility of direct divine intervention in the formation of the first man. That man was the last of all the creatures to appear on the earth is implied ; but there is no room for the theory that the body was prepared by a series of transformations through intermediate stages (p.94). That God created man is a dogma of faith. That the soul is not material is equally so. That the soul cannot, therefore, proceed from matter or spring from natural forces latent in matter seems so obvious that theology simply assumes its immediate creation not merely in the case of Adam and Eve but in the case of all their</page><page sequence="9">1928 Evolution and Catholic Doctrine 279 descendants. If any one wishes to offer another explana tion within the bounds of orthodoxy, it will be for him, to show how by natural law an immaterial, spiritual, immortal substance emerges from something possessing none of these attributes. Reason, as well as theology, demands that the effect shall be contained in the cause. It suffices, of course, that it should lie within the totality of the cause. A framer of the hypothesis under con sideration might therefore say that, as he always assumes the divine concursus, it is, natural law plus divine con currence which produces the soul of man. Yes, but this attributes to the diviine, concursus something more than is rightly understood by the word ; it involves the elevation of a secondary cause to a potentiality above its nature. This elevation must be the work of God, and hence the hypothesis either really asserts what theologians mean by the direct intervention of God or else it fails to satisfy our reason. There are, no doubt, other dogmas of faith which are popularly represented . (or misrepresented as incompatible with the evolutionary hypothesis, such as the Elevation of Adam and Eve to a state of felicity in Paradise, their perfection of body and soul before the Fall, their abase ment in consequence of it. All this is supposed to stand in direct opposition to the idea of progressive ameliora tion. But the most that would follow in strict logic is that there was an evolution per saltum, such as many scientists defend on purely scientific grounds. Indeed not even this is necessarily postulated by Catholic teaching if properly understood. Yet I cannot dwell on that point here. It must suffice to assert that when once we quit the question of creation, we pass out of the zone where natural science has any claim to speak. The elevation of man to a supernatural state, the graces of the state, loss of it, and the conse quences of that loss are not the subject-matter of research in any form whatever. The Church proclaims</page><page sequence="10">280 Studies [JUNE them as dogmas vouched for by revelation. She admits that they are not the discovery of reason or of human industry. She does not ask us to believe in them because she can prove them biologically, geologically or zoologi cally. A scientist may believe or disbelieve these dogmas just as any other man ; but both will ac300t or deny them for reasons quite distinct from science, for reasons that have hardly been even indirectly influenced by all our scientific discoveries. In conclusion, then, I may sum up thus: speculative theology has no quarrel with any theistic theory of evolution which can marshal real proofs for its assertions. The defined dogmas of the Church do not either favour or reject such theories. They stand above them, and treat of truths which, in the abstract, are quite reconcilable with them. All that they do reject are certain meta physical abortions, such as atheism and pantheism, which outrage reason and revelation alike, and which make an end not only of Catholic theology but of every religious con300t we possess. As regards the origin of man, science has so far created no real problem for theology, because it has not as yet arrived at any certain con clusion. But least anyone should question my right to make this statement, I shall let an unquestionable authority confirm it. Sir Bertram Windle writes: " Of only one thing can we feel absolutely sure, and that is that down to the present moment science has arrived at no conclusive proof of the com600 origin (of man and ape). `The only statement, consistent with her dignity, that science can make is that she knows nothing about the origin of man.' So wrote Reinke in 1902, and so must any honest biologist write to-day; for no dis covery has since been made which affords unquestionable evidence for the opposite statement." 1 Genuine difficulty, however, does arise from one source and from one source only which it would be 1 The Church and Science (London. 3rd ed. 1926. p. 390).</page><page sequence="11">1928 Evolution and Catholic Doctrine 281 dishonest to ignore or minimise. The dogma of creation causes no embarrassment whatever for any intelligent disputant; but the manner in which that dogma is revealed in the opening chapters of Genesis does un doubtedly raise some delicate issues. The facts set forth in these chapters are revealed of God, and therefore the theologian cannot admit any hypothesis in opposition to them. But the precise interpretation of details is still a matter of controversy. Nor is this due to the discoveries of modern science. It has existed since the beginning of Christianity. . The Church has not yet definitely settled the controversy. But in the encyclical of Leo XIII, Providentissimus Deus (Nov. 18, 1893), and in certain responses of the Biblical Commission (June 30, 1909 it has laid down the general principles which must guide Catholics in all their speculations. These afford a much larger liberty than the enemies of the Church imagine; but they cannot be expounded here. A Catholic is bound to show that any theory he proposes falls within the limits thus determined. That this constitutes a check on the extravagances of scientific fancy may be admitted. That it forces anyone to deny or question any ascertained truth of science is an utterly unjustified assertion. The documents referred to are marked by the prudent caution characteristic of the Church. If all scientists would imitate this truly scientific caution, we should hear less of the conflict between science and the Church. We might indeed find rapid and surprising har600isation; for genuine science could help enormously. It is really only from pseudo-science that the trouble springs. P. J. GANNON.</page></plain_text>
