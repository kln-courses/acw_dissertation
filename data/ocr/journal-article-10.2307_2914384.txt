And then, as he looked, per entro il cielo scese un, a facella, formata in cerchio a guisa di corona, e cinsela e girossi intorno ad ella. And, as it whiffed, the radiant ring sang; and earth's sweetest melody, Dante says, compared to the music of that lyre would be harsh as the thunderclap that rips a cloud; and the first words of the song were these: "Io sono amore angelico." Part of the older commentators understood this singer to repre- sent in the abstract, as the words should mean in their literal sense, or to be an individual representative of, the loving homage 5 Ia The S~turday Review o[ Igterature, III, p. 518 (January 15, 1927), Lady Adams states that twenty-four years ago she observed the reference in Browning's letter, and called it to the attention of Dr. l~ichard Garnett, who made vain attempts to identify the mysterious book in the British Museum; and that "other searchers" have since sought clues to its iden- tity with equally little success. Lady Adams also says that she men- tioned these facts in an article on Garnett in the English Boo,kmax. Although these revelations modify my claim to be the first to publish the mystery, they make it the more surprising that I should be the first to suggest a solution.</page><page sequence="2">306 M.

The chief reason for this identification is not contained in the remainder of this song, which might be said by any angel or choir of angels,2 but because of an alleged parallel in Paxrcdiso, XXXII, 94fi. There, Dante was shown "the face which most resembles Christ" (vv. 85-6), Mary's, and hosts of happy angels were "rain- ing" down above her: E quello amor che primo 1i discese, cantando "Ave A!aria, gratia plena," dinanzi a lei le sue ali distese. (vv. 94-6) There is no doubt that this is indeed Gabriel; for upon Dante's questioning him as to this point Saint Bernard tells him that . elli c quelli che portO la palma giuso a Maria, quando '1 Figliuol di Dio carcar si volse de la nostra salma. (vv. 112-4) It is not only highly debatable that the words "quello amor che primo li discese" refer to the whirling halo of Canto XXIII, rather than to the original occasion of the Annunciation in Naza- reth, but when the evidence is carefully considered it will prove to be a well-nigh indefensible contention. For, first of all, the word "primo," which is the reading given by apparently all the printed texts, and for which none of them suggests that any variant reading is found in the manuscripts, should normally mean not "before" (the adverb, which would be "prima"), as the prevalent interpretation would require, but "first" (really an adjective, the Latin "primus," in apposition 1 An occasional one, e. g., Casini, has the grace to follow the natural sense of Dante's wording and to understand that the angelic halo was already in the form of a circle when it descended; the rest would have us visualize a speed so great as to give a single point of light the appear- ance of a ring. 2 The complete song is: "lo sono amore angelico che giro / l'alta letizia. che spira del ventre / che fu albergo del nostro disiro; / e gireromxni, donna del ciel, mentre / che seguirai tuo figlio, e farai dia / piii la spera suprema perche gli entre."</page><page sequence="3">DANTE NOTES, IX 307 with the noun " amor "); and this would be the logical and natural way of stating the fact that this angel, Gabriel, who is now one of many angels that "rain" down above Mary, was the first one of them in the course of her earthly and her heavenly existence who ever descended to her. An examination of the sixty-eight other passages in the Divine Comedy in which "primo" occurs shows that in every case it unmistakably means "first," as it does in modern Italian; while the adverb " before " is rendered by " primal" in some thirty cases and by "pria" in some forty.3 The fact that Dante asks Saint Bernard "who that angel is who so jocund looks into the eyes of our Queen," in the second pas- sage (XXXII, 103-4), cannot be cited with profit on either side of the argument; for if he did not know that it was the angel of the Annunciation he could not identify it with the whirling ring of the former vision, even granting that he had understood that revolving halo to represent Gabriel. A definite and telling point is scored against the currently ac- cepted identification of the radiant; ring with Gabriel when investi- gation shows that Dante never represents individual angels as points or spheres, or other merely geometrical figures, of light, as he so often does the Blessed in the revolving heavens outside of Mercury; the envoy from Heaven who opens the gates of Dis for Dante and Vergil in Inf., IX, has hands and feet and face at least, though no wings are mentioned, and he may not be intended as a "regular" angel; the angels who guard the entrances and passageways of Purgatory are dazzling indeed, but glimpses of faces or at least wings or sensations of wing-strokes removing the sin-brands from Dante's brow regularly picture to us the angels in the standard forms of pictorial art; and the angel pilot of Purg., II, and the angel guardians of Purg., VIII, are in the same general class; as are also apparently the " hundred . . . ministers and messengers of life eternal " who in Purg., XXX, scatter flowers over Beatrice with "hands" which are called "angelic" (v. 29), though no wings are mentioned here, and they may be- long to a special category closely related to the heavenly envoy in 8 These latter figures do not include the many instances in which by the addition of " che " the adverbs " pria " and " prima " function as parts of subordinating conjunctions.</page><page sequence="4">308 M. L. N., XLII, 5 (MAY, 1927) Hell. That is, in general, individual angels are pictured to us as Dante specifically states in Par., IV, 46-8, where he is speaking of the necessity of appealing to human comprehension by the use of anthropomorphic representations of God and the angels-and here, too, it happens that he cites Gabriel as an example among others: Per questo la Scrittura condeseende a vostra facultate, e piedi e mano attribuisce a Dio, ed altro intende; e Santa Chiesa con aspetto umano Gabriel e Michel vi rappresenta, e l'altro che Tobia rifece sano. (vv. 43-48) Besides the scene of Par., XXXII, Dante pictures Gabriel to us in the lovely sculptured relief of Purg., X, 34-45, where he evi- dently wishes us to recall the familiar group of the Annunciation as canonized by Italian art; and in Par., IX, 138, a reference to Nazareth evokes the same picture, with the words: " 1a dove Gabriello aperse l'ali." Even in the case of the many lights which represent souls of the Blessed there is no instance where revolution of a point about a center is described of such speed as would make upon the beholder the impression of a continuous ring of light. In Par., XXIV, 22, the light which represented Saint Peter revolved three times about Beatrice, in sign of happy greeting when he approached her from the host of lights in the Triumph of Christ with which this paper commences; and at the end of the same Canto (vv. 151-3) he did likewise about Dante, to express his satisfaction at the latter's answers to his examination in faith; but three times only in each case, and without suggestion of speed. Taking up now the constructive side of the present argument, we find that revolving rings of light are used to represent the angelic host as a whole; and most notably in the very next, the Ninth, Heaven, after that in which appears the halo which circles about Mary's head, are seen those nine concentric rings of the Heavenly Motors, whose rotation about the Divine Point of Light symbolizes, in inverse order, to Dante's stili un-spiritualized vision,4 4See MLN, xxxiI, 146-47. During the few moments while his power of vision was in process of refashioning, Dante saw the angelic host as a whole, in the guise of ruby-like and lively sparks (Par., XXX, 64 and</page><page sequence="5">DANTE NOTES, IX 309 their loving urge Godward as ceaselessly they serve Him in the Universal Order. Why, then, should not the whirling halo of Par., XXIII, present the unanimous homage of all the angelic host to Mary, in a magnif- icent and dignified apotheosis comparable to that which the painters tried to depict with their choirs of cherubs orbing in gold about her sacred head? The words of the song are: "I am Love Angelic," not "Loving Angel," and I think that a few parallels, which are not far to seek in Dante's poem, will remove the last hesitancy to acceptance of this literal rendering. They are as follows: I. The use of the first personal singular pronoun by the collec- tive speakers is exactly paralleled in the heavens of Jupiter where Dante sees the spirits as bright lights assembled in the form of a great eagle and hears them speak their unanimous sentiments in this way; in Par., XIX, 10-12, he says of them: . io vidi e anche udi' parlar lo rostro, e sonar ne la voce e "io " e "mio," quand'era nel coneetto " noi " e " nostro." II. In the passage introducing our topic, the angelic song is com-mented upon as follows: Qualunque melodia piui dolee sona qua gift, e pitL a st I'anima tira, parrebbe nube che squarciata tona, comparata al sonar di quella lira onde si coronava il bel zaffiro del quale il ciel pit chiaro s'inzaffira. (Par., XXIII, 97-102) Now, the word "lira" occurs only once elsewhere in all Dante's works; and that is in Par., XV, 4, referring to the hymn sung by all the souls which he saw forming with their lights the great Cross 66); but this appearance was only a transitional "adumbration of the truth," as Beatrice admonished him, in v. 78; and when he became at last able to see things in their true and spiritual aspect, in the Empyrean, the traditional figures of anthropomorphic angels again reappear as they are depicted in medieval art: "Le facce tutte avean di fiamma viva, / e l'ali d'oro, e l'altro tanto bianco, / che nulla neve a quel termine arriva" (Par., XXXI, 13-15).</page><page sequence="6">310 M. L. N., XLII, 5 (MAY, 1927) in the heaven of Mars; and there the song is called a "melody" (Par., XIV, 122), as it is here (XXIII, 97; also 109), but the metaphor of the lyre appears to have been purposely chosen to suggest the harmonious blending of many notes. For the cessa- tion of that martial hymn is referred to thus: Benigna voluntade in che si liqua sempre l'amor che drittamente spira, come cupidita fa ne la iniqua, silenzio puose a quella dolce lira, e fece quietar le sante corde che la destra del cielo allenta e tira. (Par., XV, 1-6) A confirmation of the suspicion that the lyre was chosen expressly to denote the blending of many notes in one, is found in the fact that the first mention of the hymn in the heaven of Mars is intro- duced by the words: E come giga e arpa, in tempra tesa di molte corde, fa dolce tintinno a tal da cui la nota non a intesa, cosl da' lumi che 11 m'apparinno 5'accogliea per la croce una melode che mi rapiva, sanza intender l'inno. (Par., XIV, 118-23) To conclude, therefore, the direct verbal evidence strongly indi- cates, and the collateral evidence satisfactorily confirms, an under- standing of the passage in question which has an a priori claim to recognition upon aesthetic grounds: the "circulata melodia" (v. 109) is no single archangel in dizzy orbit; but is the glorious symbol of the unanimous homage of all the angelic host to Mary, brightest light of all the Human Galaxy-in a prevision which pairs with that vouchsafed to Dante, in the next and last revolving sphere, where whirling in nine concentric circles about the Divine Point of Light they show forth their ceaseless service to God.
