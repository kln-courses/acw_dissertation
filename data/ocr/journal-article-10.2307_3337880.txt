<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTS OF AFRICA, ASIA, OCEANIA, AND THE AMERICAS Musee du Louvre, Pavilion des Sessions Paris, France Opened April 2000 Reviewed by Constantine Petridis Almost twenty years after the inauguration of the Rockefeller Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Europe's most important art museum finally cleared a space for the arts of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. The opening of the Pavilion des Sessions by the President of the French Re- public, Jacques Chirac, is the result of a long ideological and intellectual debate over the introduction of "arts premiers" ("first arts"), as they have been referred to in France, into the sanctum sanctorum of Western art. In his fore- word to the exhibition catalogue, the President expresses the hope that the masterpieces shown 74 in this new wing of the Musee du Louvre "will attest that no hierarchy exists among the arts." The admission of non-European arts to the country's most prestigious museum institution thus constitutes both a symbolically laden event and an important political act.1 In this text I will not discuss the museum for non-European arts scheduled to open in 2004, which will be built by Jean Nouvel on the Quai Branly along the Seine, opposite the Eiffel Tower, although in conception it is closely related to the present exhibition at the Louvre. Those concerned, however, have pointed out that the Pavilion des Sessions, named after the parliamentary sessions for which the building was originally constructed, cannot be seen as a prefiguration or synthesis of the Musee du Quai Branly (Viatte 2000:41; Pomian 2000:80). Rather, the selection on view, which is the work of the art expert, collector, and former art dealer Jacques Kerchache, the French president's main counselor, should be considered as a complement to the future Branly museum. The Pavilion des Sessions will be permanently reserved for the arts of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, even after the opening of the Branly museum in 2004, but the many loans will necessitate a rotation system. In many respects a division remains be- tween the newly established non-European arts wing and the other collections at the Louvre. The Pavilion des Sessions occupies only a small comer of the museum and is quite remote from the main entrance under Pei's glass pyramid. Moreover, the exhibition of these non-European arts has not been accom- panied by the establishment of a curatorial department within the Louvre's walls: the administrative offices and scientific staff re- sponsible for the new wing will actually be housed in the Musee du Quai Branly. Although the other sections of the Pavilion des Sessions also contain stunning artworks, I will here limit myself to its African section. Of the 117 pieces on exhibit, 46 are from Africa. As was the case at the celebrated exhibition "Africa: The Art of a Continent" at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 1995 (Phillips 1995), visitors are welcomed by a predynastic Amratian statuette in schist, which according to the exhibition curators should link the new wing to the other departments of the Louvre. Along with some recently acquired archaeo- logical finds from Nigeria, this Egyptian statuette testifies to the antiquity of Africa's civilizations.2 Since Kerchache's selection is meant first and foremost for the layperson barely familiar with non-European arts, his choice holds few surprises for the average African-art amateur. Given the limited number of objects included, Kerchache did not attempt to present an ency- clopedic survey. He emphasized that his selec- tion was driven by subjective and even "autobiographical" motives (Geoffroy-Schneiter 2000b:6). As can be inferred from the title of the associated catalogue, Sculptures: Afrique, Asie, Oceanie, Amriques, only sculptural works are shown. In order to avoid the anecdotal and to negate stereotypical ideas about African art, Kerchache deliberately limited the number of materials other than wood, and included sur- prisingly few masks and just one "power fig- ure" (Varenne 2000:27). As a result of these limitations, the layperson is likely to leave the Louvre with a simplified and distorted view of the arts of the African continent. The objects on view have mainly been lent by national museums and a few other French and overseas institutions. Taking the colonial history of the national collections into account, it should not come as a surprise that the former French African regions are well represented. The strong presence of Nigeria is mainly the result of the French state's acquisition in 1997 of 276 Nigerian art objects from the Musee Barbier-Mueller, Geneva (Willett &amp; Eyo 1997). The installation also includes some new acqui- sitions for the future Musee du Quai Branly, the result of donations as well as purchases. The gifts raise important ethical questions, since some of the donors have also sold ob- alrican arts autumn 2001</page><page sequence="2">Opposite page: Drum finial.

The Musee Barbier-Mueller is a case in point: France paid about FF 40 million to acquire the 276 Nigerian pieces mentioned above. As suggest- ed by the code of ethics of the International Council of Museums (ICOM), the risk of a conflict of interest arising from the simultane- ous donation and sale of artworks is real. The gifts Anne and Jacques Kerchache made to the Quai Branly have also aroused suspicion, because it is thought that they will increase the value of what remains in their private possession (Noce 2000a:3). In order to prevent any misunderstanding on these sensitive points, it is imperative that the government issue a clearly articulated and well-consid- ered policy. Then there is the allegation that by buying Nok terracottas from one or more Belgian deal- ers, the French state disregarded the UNESCO treaties for the protection of Nigeria's archaeo- logical heritage. According to one journalist, the agreement signed with the Nigerian gov- ernment in which France promises funds for and assistance with protecting Nigeria's artis- tic heritage actually looks like an attempt to buy its impunity (Noce 2000b:5; see also Mark 2000:93). However, the problem seems to reside in the fact that Belgium ratified neither the 1970 UNESCO Convention nor the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention. Therefore, instead of accusing a number of individual art dealers, what is urgently needed is the ratification and implementation of these treaties and resolu- tions by all European countries involved. It is obvious that prestigious institutions like the Louvre should set the standard by adopting a rigorous acquisition and exhibition policy, especially since the Musee du Quai Branly is under UNESCO's patronage. By devoting our attention almost exclusive- ly to the ethics of the acquisition of archaeolog- ical objects from west Africa, we sometimes forget that the export of nonarchaeological objects from Africa did not always occur peace- fully or smoothly either. Despite Jean-Louis Paudrat's fascinating historical introduction to the African part of the Louvre catalogue (pp. 44-57), and many interesting historical facts in some of the catalogue entries, one finds very little information about the colonial context of most of the works on exhibit and even less about the "collection history" of the most recent acquisitions. Laudably, however, the Louvre has clearly distanced itself from the postmodernist self-critique which has threat- ened to paralyze a number of ethnographic museums in Europe.3 In some cases the post- autumn 2001 ? atrican arts 75</page><page sequence="3">colonial identity crisis entailed by this moral introspection has led to a total neglect of the artistic value of the objects contained in their ethnography collections. The Louvre, however, has deliberately cho- sen what the French press terms an "aesthetic approach," stressing the "excellence of form" (Roux 2000:28). This approach, befitting an art museum, is greatly served by the sober and "cool" presentation of designer Jean-Michel Wilmotte, in which the objects themselves are the focus of attention. Most of them are indi- vidually shown in large glass cases on elegant bronze mounts or freely exhibited on flat bronze bases. The size of the cases gives the impression that the sculptures are floating. The two large African rooms are suffused with a soft natural light filtered through a sophisticat- ed system of metal shades, but almost every object is also lit by four spotlights fixed against the seven-meter-high ceilings. The pale, sandy- colored stone of the walls and floors adds to the serene atmosphere which greatly enhances the appreciation of the artworks. Moreover, the fact that the 117 objects are dispersed over an area of 1,400 square meters makes it possible to view all the exhibits from all four sides. The actual object labels in the exhibition, in French, English, and Spanish, are very concise and offer only minimal information. As noted earlier by Frank Willett (1991:189-90), using ver- nacular terms like nimba or eyima bieri without explanation does not teach the visitor anything. Many of the labels mention very early dates, but the scientific criteria on which they are based are not always dear. The attributions of some works could also cause confusion among the lay pub- lic in that they give the impression that names such as Nok, Sapi, Baga Buluiiits, or Bidjogo all have the same bearing. Furthermore, contrary to the dear-cut identifications offered at the Louvre, it is generally known among Africanist 76 art historians that many styles cannot be neatly equated with ethnic groups. In spite of this so-called aesthetic or decon- textualized presentation, visitors can gain in- sight into the cultural background of the objects in different ways. Handouts in French and English contain quite elaborate sum- maries of the catalogue entries. This cata- logue, edited by Jacques Kerchache, is an impressive collective work which draws not only on the collaboration of forty-eight spe- cialists, among them such eminent experts as Ezio Bassani, Leon Siroto, and Robert Farris Thompson, but also a number of upcoming scholars like Marlene Biton, Vincent Boulore (who also assisted Kerchache with the gener- al editing of the volume), Marie-Yvonne Curtis, and Helene Joubert. Those who want to delve even deeper into the objects' cultural context can consult the well-made CD-ROM in the specifically designed "espace d'inter- pretation." In this separate comer, where dark colors dominate, about twelve computers are available to visitors who want to lear more about the exhibited pieces through both image and sound. The Louvre installation also offers more than a mere aesthetic approach, as the objects are exhibited according to geographical and, to a lesser extent, historical criteria. Although it could easily go unnoticed by the less informed visitor, Kerchache opted for this kind of arrangement with the aim of shedding light on the multiple formal relationships between the different cultures represented (Geoffroy- Schneiter 2000b:5-6). Unfortunately, practical constraints of space have affected the internal logic of this scheme in a number of instances. Perhaps the most effective juxtaposition is the grave marker of the Sakalava people of Madagascar, which is placed in the small gate- way leading to the Asian art section, near two Left: Figure.

There is little doubt that amateurs of Afri- can art will recognize the high artistic quality of Kerchache's subjective selection. One may assume that it reflects the consensus that seems to exist in the West among experts, curators, art dealers, and collectors about such vague notions as "aesthetic perfection" and "artistic value." However, it should be stressed that we are mostly dealing here with the opinions of outsiders, not of the makers and users of the artworks. Research into local aesthetics shows not only that the spokespersons for these cul- tures have their own aesthetic preferences and distinguish good from bad art, but that our preferences do not necessarily coincide with theirs. An art museum which claims to cele- brate respect for arts from all places and all times has the moral obligation to acknowledge these insights. The same is true for a museum whose ultimate goal is to transcend the artifi- cial opposition between so-called aesthetic and ethnological approaches.

Except for two catalogues and a CD-ROM published in conjunction with the opening of the Louvre wing, articles about the event have appeared in both the specialized and the general art press. The French magazines Arts d'Afrique Noire, Beaux Arts, Connaissance des Arts, and Telerama each devoted a special issue to it. Two general books bearing the unhappy term "arts premiers" in their title, were published on the occasion of the opening as well (Degli &amp; Mauze 2000; Geoffroy-Schneiter 2000a). The debate surrounding the Louvre wing and the future Musee du Quai Branly also led to the publication of thematic issues of the Africanist journals Cahiers d'Etudes Africaines (Dupuis 1999) and Le Journal des Africanistes (Coquet 1999). 2. In fact, this particular statuette was already included in the reference book L'art africain by Kerchache, Paudrat, and Stephan (1988). 3.

At the time of writing, "One + One = Many" has taken on another meaning. Due to a current restructuring program at Wits, the internally managed cleaning service has been dis- continued, their services outsourced. As South African unem- ployment is high, this created a very difficult labor issue that required careful management. After June 2000, people in uni- forms such as that displayed were no longer seen on campus, thus adding a new dimension to the display. 2.

A similar but not iden- tical practice in the United States is known as Spiritualism, and the New Orleans institution under discussion is followed by members of the Spiritual Churches in that city. 2. The Frenchman Allan Kardec (1804-1869) was born Hyppolyte Leon Denizard Rivail, and his book of orations, Le livre des esprits (The book of spirits), published in 1857, has been translated, and reprinted endlessly. He published The Book of Mediums in 1859 and The Gospel According to Spiritism in 1864. By 1868 he had published six books related to Spiritist studies. Kardec's ideas initially attracted European and Latin American intellectuals and urban elites but quickly filtered through into other sectors of society. By the 1860s his work was available in Cuba and Puerto Rico, and throughout the 1880s it became the topic of various publications concern- ing psychological and theological studies in both countries. 3.

In The Spirit of Black Hawk (University Press of Mississippi, Jackson, 1995), Jason Berry, relying on information obtained during interviews conducted by the Federal Writers Project after her death, notes that Mother Anderson wore a "mantle" bearing the image of Black Hawk, and that Black Hawk had first come to her in a vision while she was working in Chicago (p. 58). Yet the only specific Black Hawk Spiritual Churches are in New Orleans. I wonder if this "mantle," as described by her disciples in the Church, resembled the "cos- tume" worn by the Mardi Gras Indians of New Orleans, which is often adorned with a beaded image of a generic Indian (see photograph, circa 1929, of her disciple, Mother Catherine Seals, wearing such a mantle in Berry, p. 74).

On the importance of Joram Mariga, Thomas Mukarobgwa, their relations with Frank McEwen, and the genesis of Zimbabwean stone sculpture as a unique synthesis of tradi- tional Shona beliefs and European modernism, as well as for contrasting views on the germinal role of patron-clients, see Kasfir 1999:68-77 and Zilberg 2001:31-47. For further detail on the connections between "Shona" sculpture and European artistic traditions, namely with the School of Paris and the British Arts and Crafts Movement, among others, see Zilberg 1996, 1997. For an excellent account of Shona material culture, religion, and aesthetics, see Dewey 1993. 3. For a detailed and contentiously received consideration of the issues raised by Chigwedere, see Zilberg 1993. This semi- nar paper argues that American country music, notably the songs and persons of Dolly Parton and Don Williams, have a greater relevance to ordinary daily life in Zimbabwe than the much vaunted Shona sculpture. For a somewhat less critical view, see Zilberg 2001a. Combined bibliography Cousins, Jane. 1991. "The Making of Zimbabwean Stone Sculp- ture," Third Text 1, 3:31-42.
