A shamanic initiatory engraving from the Burrup Peninsula, northwest Western Australia KIM SALES Abstract A 'neuropsychological model' has been proposed which links jock art production with shamanistic experiences whilst in altered states of consciousness. The model claims universality, and hence this paper seeks to apply it to a rock art panel from the Pilbara region, Western Australia, in an assessment of its utility. Evidence of shamanism as practiced in Australia is gleaned from the ethnographic literature, entoptic motifs are identified in Australian rock art and an interpretation of the particular panel is advanced in the light of this. The potential of the model to amplify our understanding of Australian rock art is indicated. Recently there has been an upsurge of interest in the entoptic and hallucinatory derivation of rock art motifs, and the shamanic context of rock art systems (Bednarik 1984, 1986; Hedges 1982, 1983; Lewis-Williams 1986; Maggs and Sealy, 1983; Thackeray et al. 1981). This trend has received a major boost from the publication of Lewis- Williams and Dowson's paper 'Signs of All Times' (1988). This moves beyond merely noting formal parallels between entoptic phenomena or phosphenes and certain graphic depictions, to develop a more complex 'neuropsychological model' of the ways in which people who experience certain altered states of consciousness (ASC) apprehend mental imagery, or the mammals), it should identify 'signs for many places' as well. It could be applicable to Australian Aboriginal rock art studies, if indeed aspects of this art derive from ASC. The model is discussed in more detail later. Reaction to the model has ranged from outright rejection (Bednarik 1990; Consens 1988; Mirimanov 1988; Marshack 1989 - but see Lewis-Williams and Dowson's replies) to cautious acceptance (Bradley 1989; Clegg 1988; Faulstich 1988). Faced with the logical impossibility of conclusively proving or disproving any hypothesis (Chalmers 1978), evaluation of the model must include some sort of assessment of its utility. Does it have explanatory potential when applied to rock art from different time periods, and different continents, enabling more to be said about them than was hitherto possible? Here, I take only a small step towards such evaluation, by applying the model and indicating that it has great potential as a source of insights into prehistoric pictures. First, I will review the Australian ethnographic literature to show that the concept 'shamanism' applies on this continent, and to identify the general structure of Aboriginal beliefs concerning this phenomenon. Figure 2 should be viewed in conjunction with this, establishing the existence of entoptics and hallucinations perceived when, specifically , they are in a trance state.

All depictions in this paper are copied from published sources, though some have been reorientated to facilitate their display in table form. Despite this reliance on other people's recording, examples of entoptics are not difficult to find. Narratives recorded in the Pilbara region, Western Australia (see Fig.l) will then be presented to show that concepts of shamanic experience held locally tally well with the wider, cross-continental, corpus of beliefs (see Table 1). Figure 3 illustrates regional, Pilbara rock art entoptic forms, indicating that the neuro- psychological models' categories can be as easily applied locally as they can across the continent Next, I will apply the neuropsychological model to a single rock engraving panel from the art-rich Burrup Peninsula,in the Pilbara, to identify entoptic and hallucinatory components suggestive ENTOPTIC Coastal Inland Vl ^JV "^^P^ Figure 3.

Finally, in order to avoid the reductionism implicit in application of a universalistic model, concepts about shamanic initiation gleaned from the literature will be used in an interpretation of a possible 'deeper* meaning of the motifs in the panel. Australian Shamanism A fragmentary, yet useful, body of ethnographic literature exists dealing with Australian Aboriginal "men of high degree", sorcerers, magicians, medicine men, native doctors and clever men. The most detailed information comes from the south-east, centre and north-west of the Australian continent, but some reports from other regions are available (Berndt 1946,1987; Coates 1966; Eliade 1964, 1973; Elkin 1977, 1984; Gould 1969; Howitt 1904; Kolig 1981; Lommel 1952; Mathews 1904; Petri 1952, 1954; Rose 1956; Tonkinson 1970, 1978). From these references it is possible to identify practices and initiation rituals characteristic of the Australian shaman. I have tabulated these to avoid endless repetition of ethnographic examples (see Table 1). Eliade's (1964, 1973) comparative approach is most useful here, as he incorporates much of the early ethnographic evidence in his synthesis. Lewis-Williams and Dowson define shamans as '...persons in hunter-gatherer societies who enter altered states of consciousness to perform various curing and supernatural functions' (1988:233). In his tome on shamanism Eliade gives a similar definition, the shaman is '...the great master of ecstasy' (1964:4) or more particularly the shaman '...specialises in a trance during which his soul is believed to leave his body and ascend to the sky or descend to the underworld' (p.5). Elkin, speaking of an Ungarinyin doctor, notes his ability to '...put himself in a trance and to send his ya-yari ( his dream familiar) from his body to gather information' (1984:286). This ability to induce an ASC and utilise it for out-of-body travel is characteristic of Australian 'men of high degree', and as a simplification I shall subsume the many terms used to describe such people under the one word 'shaman'. Eliade points out that the Tungusic word 'saman' was originally applied in a restricted sense to Siberian and Central Asian magicoreligious practitioners, but as research in the Americas, Indonesia and Oceania recorded similar phenomena '...there is every reason to study them together with Siberian shamanism' (1944:5). He opined that the Australian Shamanic experience was comparable to that found elswhere. Indeed, the word is not foreign to Australian ethnological literature. Kolig (1981: 316) used it in reference to men with the ability to 'dive' into waterholes in the Kimberley in order to contact the Rainbow Serpent, and Mathews (1904:62) used it to describe the occultists of the Roebourne and Pilbara area, who performed various increase rituals. The Australian shaman is attributed with special capabilities which enable him or her to perform various functions.This sets them apart from other members of society, but they in no way constitute an institutional religious elite. They are believed to have special skills, esoteric knowledge and psychic powers which allow them to 25</page><page sequence="5">re-establish contact with the spiritual realm, the Dreamtime powers (Tonkinson 1978:107). This contact is effected via ecstatic experience, when asleep or in a trance, by going on extracorporeal journeys. Amongst the Aranda the shaman apparently transforms into an eaglehawk to go on out-of-body travel (Elkin 1977: 121), in the Kimberleys they are believed to use a magical string (p. 138), whilst the Mardudjara are said to sit on a raft of magic boards, or ride on '...the back of a magical hair string that becomes a snake in flight' (Tonkinson 1978: 108). On these travels the shamans can summon clouds and make rain, see spirits and thus defend against black magic, utilise their 'third eye' (Coate 1966) or X-ray vision to diagnose illness, and monitor distant events. Shamans can reputedly both heal and hurt. They use magical objects to eliminate foreign bodies held responsible for illness in patients, but are the most effective sorcerers, believed to be able to place a curse, 'point a bone', or 'sing' an illness better than other members of society with lesser spiritual ability (Eliade 1964). Aboriginal shamans are widely associated with a collection of paraphernalia (both actual and fantastical) primary amongst which are the magical objects bestowed on a novice shaman during his/her initiation by the responsible beings. These power concentrates include quartz crystal, iridescent pieces of pearl shell and occasionally, small serpents or other familiars described by Elkin (1984) as individual assistant totems. Berndt (1987) gives a fascinating description of the yarida magic stick as used by Ngadjuri shamans to afflict or to cure. Another chimerical item commonly possessed by shamans is the magical or aerial rope/cord, implicated in the shaman's ability to fly, to gravitate to the tops of trees, to ascend to the sky realm in certain shamanic initiatory rituals, and used in power demonstrations. Thus Wuradjeri shamans were said to use their magic cords to ascend to the sky '...as a spider used his web' (Eliade 1973: 135), whilst the Mara shaman reputedly climbed '...at night time by means of a rope ... into the sky, where he can converse with the sky people' (Spencer and Gillen 1904:488). Shamanic Initiation The shamanic specialist, Eliade's 'master of ecstasy', could become such by vocation, personal quest, or inheritance. Tonkinson (1978) remarks that the 10-15% of the male population of Jigalong Mission who become mabarn, inherit their powers patrilineally , without lengthy or elaborate initiation. However, their magical objects are given to them by others, implying peer approval and acknowledgment. In most other groups studied, however, special shamanic initiation rituals are necessary, with a mystical experience being the central component. These have been described for south-east Australia (Berndt 1946; Eliade 1972, 1973; Elkin 1977), the north-west (Coate 1966; Lommel 1952; Petri 1954), Queensland and the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory (Radcliffe-Brown 1926) and Central Australia (Spencer and Gillen 1899). Most candidates were male, but women could be initiated: '...a candidate ... meditates, talks with the spirits, goes into a trance and sees visions ... women can be initiated in the same way, with power equal to men's' (Berndt and Berndt 1988: 309). The act of entering a profound ASC and having consequent visions and hallucinatory experiences (often monitored by an established shaman) is crucial in separating the potential shaman from other initiated adults: 'Not anyone who wants to can become a medicine man; vocation is indispensable. And this vocation is manifested above all by an unusual capacity for ecstatic experience' (Eliade 1964: 65-66). Rose (1956) likewise suggests that while mild hypnotic states may be induced in all initiates, for those who aspire to become doctors '...more profound trance states are expected' (p.52). Thus the ability to enter deep trance states with attendant hallucinatory visions is important to the shaman not only in later performance of public duties, but also in the initiatory quest, where the shaman-to-be acquires theurgical power bestowed by spiritual beings. Shamanic initiations are broadly similar across the continent (Berndt and Berndt 1988; Elkin 1977). The entranced postulant is deemed to be 'dead' and in this state is transformed. Visions involved include bodily trans- formation or the dismemberment of the novice's body, and the removal of internal organs. These are later replaced, together with the all important magical substances. Older shamans, or spiritual beings, are said to be responsible for these operations, and they occur together with a descent to underworld (or underwater) realms or an ascent to the sky, or both. The novice is then revived, and rejoins society as a substantially altered person - a person of enhanced spiritual power and awesome capabilities. Eliade (1964) describes a range of variations on these basic themes. I will present three illustrative examples, indicating the importance of ascent in initiation scenarios and its association with the magical rope, used thereafter for extracorporeal journeys. Amongst the Wuradjeri, SE Australia, the leaning towards shamanism was inherited patrilineally (Berndt 1946; Howitt 1904). During a probationary period the postulant's father or paternal grandfather would instruct him and assign a totem to become the future shaman's familiar. When aged between twenty and thirty, aspirants would gather at a special site, sacred and associated with Baiarne, the 'AH Father' or 'Sky God', and see him in a vision. Baiarne was said to spew sacred water, liquefied quartz crystal, over the postulants, whereupon they sprouted feathers and grew wings. Several days later Baiarne would reappear, teaching the aspirants to fly and inserting crystals into their foreheads which gave them X-ray vision. Finally he gave them the magical sinew cord. Alternatively the postulants would visit the sky realm by being drawn through the air on a string trailed by a bird (Eliade 1973:132), or they would grasp a cord which led to a rock through which the postulants would pass to collect crystals. Finally, there is a description of extracorporeal travel where the novice and his shaman father mount threads to ascend to the sky, having first followed the shaman's familiar (a tiger snake) by means of a string attaching them 26</page><page sequence="6">to its tail: 'It was one of the strings which the medicine men drew out of themselves...' (Eliade 1973:132). According to Elkin (1977:43, 93-107) almost every- where in south-east and north-west Australia (the regions from which he had data) the quartz crystals and pearl shell objects which transmute a shaman's body and mediate his powers are associated with the sky world and the rainbow. Coate (1966) provides an account of "medicine men" and their making recorded on tape by an Aboriginal and published with interlineal and free translations. The speaker was an Ungarinyin man, married to a Bard woman and speaking about Bard shamans from the south-west Kimberley. Coate describes this account as the established belief of many dialect groups in this area, extending down south to Port Hedland (23S Ian east of the Burrup Peninsula). Shamans here are said to be closely associated with the rai, spirit beings who are either spirits of the dead or pre-existent spirit children. The rai are invisible to all except 'medicine men', and they give these men their shamanic powers (p.96). The shamanic novice apparently enters an ASC for his initiation: 'This one is simply lying down dead and his soul remains over there' (p.98) and 'His spirit was many. He is still lying down. He is going in a dream. They put him to sleep there. In his bed place he is sleeping. At that time he is travelling in his mind'(p.99). In this state he apprehends the rai and is taken by them to their home, or 'chasm*. They remove his intestines and organs, hang them up and instruct him to stare at them until he recognises them. The postulant's body is then apparently placed over a hot earth oven with magical cooking stones in it, and is covered with paperbark until perspiration streams down. The rai then replace the organs and close up the flesh, whereafter the aspirant can go '...into the air like a bird (and) can travel underneath. Below the earth he rumbles along...' (p.99). The rai take him and teach him many things, and insert magic stones into him, including one in the eye region: 'Then flickering they are, inside, right in his eye' (p.5). This gives him X-ray vision, or the 'third eye'. The rai are also said to follow the 'aerial rope', which the new shaman can now see and also follow. Indeed, the rai may take the shaman about on a magical rope, helping to mend it if it breaks: '...they join his "aerial rope" again for him' (p. 103). Only initiated shamans can see this magic rope: 'They are the spirits of the dead, they don't walk on the ground. The world is big. They travel in the air following the "aerial rope" . They are invisible. I can't see it like the magicians. It stays in the air. I'm ignorant of these things ... only magicians can see it. He is a magician who follows the "aerial rope" all the time' (p. 104). Evidence of shamanism amongst Pilhara Aborigines The use of ethnographic analogy for interpretation of archaeological data is often justified by demonstrating some spatiohistorical link between the source of the analogy (ethnological literature) and the subject (here art produced by the former inhabitants of the Burrup Peninsula). In addition, one can use ethnography to identify general similarities between various human phenomena, which may then be applied in new contexts. In the tabulation of shamanic characteristics and initiations given above, it can be seen that certain themes (trance and mystical experiences while ritually dead, bodily transformations in the presence of spirits, rebirth substantially altered) are pan- Australian, or at least '...broadly similar for the whole Continent' (Berndtand Berndt 1988:308). Even more specific concepts such as ascent to the sky and travel via shamanic control of a magical cord are widely represented. Of the examples cited, those relating to the Port Hedland area (approximately 235 km east of the Burrup Peninsula engravings), the Karadjeri of La Grange (approximately S90 km northeast), the Mardudjara of the Lake Disappointment region (approximately 6S0 km southeast) and the various dialect groups in the Kimberleys (approximately 650 to 1360 km northeast) are most closely spatially linked to the Pilbara region. A trade route existed in the past linking the Pilbara to coastal groups to the north-east and to the Kimberley cultural bloc (McCarthy 1939:191). Nevertheless these links are somewhat tenuous, and the Pilbara and Kimberley regions are known to have had cultural differences: the Pilbara had four-section social organisation, as opposed to the patrilineal moieties of the Kimberley. Prior to European contact times the Kariera and Ngaluma of the Pilbara apparently neither circumcised nor subincised their male novices, whereas in the Kimberley both rites were practiced. The Pan-Australian shamanic characteristics described above supercede these differences, yet more directly relevant ethnological evidence dealing with Pilbara shamanism should be presented convincingly to place it alongside the wider Australian structure of beliefs. The Yaburara people originally inhabited the islands of the Dampier Archipelago, of which the Burrup Peninsula was one. They were closely linked socially and economically to the mainland Ngaluma (Gara n.d.), and their language was a dialect of Ngaluma, or 'seaside Ngaluma' (Von Brandenstein 1970: VII). Following the decimations of smallpox, pearlers' impressment, and the infamous 'Flying Foam Massacre' (Gara 1983), by the 1870's no Yaburara- speakers survived. However, the Ngaluma did, and their ethnology provides us with our most direct, spatiohistorically linked, source of information on traditional custom which may aid in interpretation of Burrup art. Ethnographic literature on the Ngaluma is scarce, and no research has been done specifically into Pilbara shamanism, although Mathews (1904:62) did remark that local shamans performed increase rituals. However, between 1964 and 1968 C. G. Von Brandenstein, a linguist, collected a series of narratives on traditional and contemporary Ngaluma life from a Ngaluma-speaking informant, and published them together with some Indjibandji stories (Von Brandenstein 1970). Ngaluma and Indjibandji-speakers were neighbours before a general trend to urbanise and settle in Roebourne mingled the two groups. Von Brandenstein had a high opinion of the amount of traditional knowledge retained by his informants, noting that the people had not endured the disruptive effects of massive urbanisation or excessive missionary zeal. European pastoralism may have fostered a 27</page><page sequence="7">form of "cowboy culture', yet it also allowed traditional pursuits to be followed to a degree. Of interest to us is the fact that his major storyteller was acknowledged as a powerful and trusted/feared mobankarra^ or magician (p.xv). He was 76 when interviewed by Von Brandenstein, so although he is unlikely to have met any Yaburara (being born in the late 1800 's, some 30 years after their demise), he must have heard of them from members of the previous generation. Seven of the stories recorded deal with shamanic activities. Narratives 38 and 57 collected by Von Brandenstein (pp. 15-158, 272-273) are quite explicit regarding the supernatural activities of shamans while in an ASC and the use of magic crystals. Narrative 38 tells of the informant's own supernatural efforts to destroy a cough - talu spirit (sic), one liable to bring disease. The ghost was seen sitting in a tree, so the mobankarra donned 'magic wings' and gave chase, using his magic crystal to reveal the ghost's tracks. The spirit escaped, leaving a balloon-shaped cough - talu filled with its own blood, which the shaman destroyed. The following night he again encountered the spirit, while in an ASC: 'The next night I went again in a trance, this being a Kurdu trance' (p. 158), and in this state he could perform certain supernatural functions: Ί stomped on the ground and made it close, buried his two tracks, all, and I came right up (to him)' (p.158). Unable to escape into the tightened earth, and hemmed in by a lowered sky, the spirit attempted to flee to the sea, but the shaman contrived to travel there and block off its path, and then killed it by scoring a direct hit with the magic crystal, boasting the while of his superior cleverness (i.e. manipulation of supernatural power). This narrative establishes that the Ngaluma mobankarra utilised trance to perform supernatural functions, and can hence be called a shaman. Apparently different kinds, levels or stages of trance could be induced (we get no clue as to the method of induction), as here the special kurdu trance is needed to control the earth and sky and finally despatch the spirit. As elsewhere in Australia, a magic crystal is the shaman's instrument of power (see also narrative 11, Von Brandenstein 1970:33-34), where a shaman 'cuts off a threatening serpent, in the form of a whirlwind, by hitting it with his crystal). In narrative 38 the phrase Ί go' or Ί went' (waga-na) indicates entering an ASC. In narrative 57 the mobankarra describes the activities of a visiting shaman, a renowned rainmaker, at work in the 1940's. Having purified himself by painting black mud onto his chest, he fell into a trance to effect the important June rainfall: 'He changed his personality by putting on his headgear and went. The magic torch he whirled around and rubbed birdsdown on himself. He stomped the ground quivering so that the down would be blown off him by the dance movements. Gone off in his trance, he was carried away and put down where he should stay' (p.272, my emphasis). In narrative 57 the mobankarra describes the activities of a visiting shaman, a renowned rainmaker, at work in the 1940's. Having purified himself by painting black mud onto his chest, he fell into a trance to effect the important June rainfall: 'He changed his personality by putting on his headgear and went. The magic torch he whirled around and rubbed birdsdown on himself. He stomped the ground quivering so that the down would be blown off him by the dance movements. Gone off in his trance, he was carried away and put down where he should stay* (p.272, my emphasis). Unfortunately we have no description of the visions the shaman might have seen whilst in his deep state of trance, or how he performed supernaturally. Nevertheless, again an ASC is used to perform a positive social function. The idiom indicating trance inducement is specifically explained by Von Brandenstein: ' "to go" here ... means "to fall in trance, be in ecstasy" ' (p.272, note 5). Again stages of trance are indicated - at first the entranced rainmaker remains upright, then, having danced, he falls comatose (implying some link between physical exertion and trance inducement). The importance of magical substances can be seen - the magical torch is said to be a quartz crystal or glass attached to human hairstring (a magic cord?). The most intriguing of the narratives dealing with the supernatural acts of shamans is number 37 (p. 147-1 50), the Tjuna mission for the identification of murderers. The inquisitors first meet to make specific ceremonial head- dresses which they don (thus 'changing personality' and entering an ASC in a manner analogous to the activities of the rainmaker?). Then they set out on a journey in single file '...behind one another' (p.147). This narrative is presented twice, as it was told, first in English and then in Ngaluma. In the English version it is unclear whether at this stage the inquisitors have gone off into trance, and whether the subsequent journey and experiences are extracorporeal. The nature of the actions which follow suggest this may be the case. However the Ngaluma version includes the idiom 'we go' repeatedly before magic from a crystal is 'thrown' and spirits are communicated with. Thus: 'nganana waga-na-ba waga-na nganana ... maparn-wai padargu, mur naba warruga kalu-gu translated by Von Brandenstein as 'we go, go we ... magic - with throw it, close ghost call' (p. 152). The inquisitors thus enter trance in order to project their magic and call up a ghost-familiar to contact the dead man's spirit. The familiar is repeatedly sent forth to bring back the 'dead man angel' (p. 147), controlled by the magic emitted by a magic crystal. Eventually the murdered man's spirit approaches the gathered shamans, and they can follow him. This they do in formation, connected to each other by a thread or line, similar to the thread of a spider's web. Should the leader be 'hit' he falls back in line, and the second shaman takes the lead: 'We needn't this one, you know, that spider web on the tree, when you roll up the other day a scrub-wood spider (Von Brandenstein's note: 'a few days ago I had shown him an exceptionally strong thread from such a spider's web'). If the top leader hit that don't break 'em! He'd go to back. The behind feller takes the lead way round there, the other'd follow. He go right up' (p. 148). In this manner the shamans approach the dead man and his murderer's spirits, whom they surround. The dead man is allowed to escape, but the murderers are detained until 28</page><page sequence="8">recognised. Eventually they are released by loosening the earth: 'land loose put it' (p. 155), which had presumably been 'stomped' or danced tight whilst in a kurdu trance as described in narrative 38. Having successfully identified the murderers the shamans return to camp (come out of trance?) to discuss punitive action. We have typical shamanic themes in this narrative: trance and travel whilst in an ASC, use of magical crystals, control of a spirit familiar, communication with spirits which can be seen and heard, and supernatural abilities. Additionally, there is the image of shamans in an ASC moving in single file, connected at one stage by a cord likened to the thread of a spider's web. Thus in the Pilbara, as elsewhere in Australia, the notion of a magical cord associated with shamanic travel is evident. Eliade (1973: 128-129) listed as the functions of shamans defence against black magic, discovery of murderers, performance of important duties during 'tribal' initiations and the curing of illness. One Ngaluma narrative does hint that the Pilbara shaman played a role in normal initiation rituals, describing how the shaman released the novice from his meat taboo (Von Brandenstein 1970:82). None of the narratives describe healing. However, Von Brandenstein and Thomas (1974) have published a collection of tabi (personal) song-poems from the Pilbara. One of these was written by the husband of a sick woman, describing an extracorporeal journey undertaken by our shaman (the narrator in the Ngaluma stories referred to above) in order to heal the woman: Out of the crowd, I have seen you travelling south of Pardoo High up and out of human sight In full regalia. Your outstretched arms bear the magic torch, Which is rope of twisted hair, Beaming, sparkling far ahead, Called the Murdinara with the gleaming point. Clearly I see you there aloft, Your halo burning around your crown. So you travel, [shaman's name] (p.33) The poem emphasises the magical flight undertaken by a shaman, on a mercy mission, and his 'magic torch' of crystal and cord. This indicates that the Pilbara shamans also functioned to cure illness. The other duties of shamans are amply attested in the narratives. They also clearly illustrate what Eliade (1964) sees as being the shaman's central characteristic: the ability to enter trance states and thus encounter and communicate with supernatural beings. Consequently these narratives serve to slot Pilbara shamanism into the wider corpus of pan- Australian beliefs, whilst providing us with valuable specific accounts of this phenomenon, as opposed to the generalised accounts so often encountered in the ethnographic literature. Aboriginal shamans and art production There are some hints in the ethnography that shamans are associated with art production. Isaacs (1984) remarks that an old Aboriginal woman, when asked early this century about the Sydney-Hawkesbury engravings (south-east Australia) attributed them to the 'clever men' of magic. Berndt (1987) has provided a comprehensive explanation of a South Australian engraving (see entopic 1, Fig.l) by noting its similarity to a yarida magic stick, an object only safely manipulated by a mindaba (or doctor), who can be termed a shaman as his primary skill was the ability to control his spirit and '...make it leave his body during a trance' (p.20). Elkin (1977) describes shamanic initiation in the Warburton Ranges, Western Australia, which takes place in a cave with rock engravings: 'This head doctor has ... marbain (magical substances) as his cult totem. The totemic site is a stone cave in which a man, snakes and marbain can be seen cut in the stone. The postulant goes to this cave, and after having given a present to the owner, is made to lie down and in due time comes out a medicine man' (p. 106, my emphasis). Elkin (1984) also refers to tree carving done by south-east Australian shamans: 'On the trunk and limbs of the tree two doctor-men, supported by their "clever ropes" , had engraved designs of animals, weapons and symbols' (p.284). In the Northern Territory, Chaloupka (1984) notes that ' . ..stories about the numi continue to be told, whilst a number of Aboriginal clever men still associated with these spirits. It is said that it was the mimi ... who first painted the images on the rock walls of their shelters and thus "taught" the people this skill' (p. 13). This illustrates the intimate connection between spirit-beings and shamans, and provides a link to art production. Observations made by Gould (1969) in the Western Desert of Western Australia provide clear evidence of shamans producing art in various media. Thus a Nyantun- yatjara (Pitjantjatjara dialect) man who had '...a reputation as a powerful sorcerer' (p.21), was observed carving entoptic motifs onto a yirilmari sacred board, a ceremonial object which could also be wielded by a shaman to project illness into victims. The board was decorated with concentric circles and catenary curves on one surface, and a grid and parallel line pattern on the obverse (ibid: 23). Moreover, this same man was also observed producing rock art: '...I have also seen designs painted by [the shaman] inside a small cave ... which he says shows the tracks he has seen left behind by a mamu' (p. 132). Mamu are nocturnal spirits of the dead and 'Only sorcerers can see them or their tracks...' (p. 129). Knowing what we do about the pan- Australian notions of shamanic practices, it is reasonable to assume that mamu and their tracks are apprehended whilst the shaman is in trance. Hence we have a direct correlation between shamanic visions and rock art motifs. A Western Australian Museum video shows the painting of a red ochre serpent on a tree trunk as part of a Pilbara 29</page><page sequence="9">region rainmaking ceremony, but there is no direct ethnohistorical evidence from the Pilbara that shamans produced rock art. This is where Lewis- Williams' and Dowson's (1988) neuropsychological model becomes useful. The Neuropsychological Model The model is based on psychological research into the images seen by subjects in an ASC. Shown to be applicable to known shamanic art (Southern San and Coso), it can be utilised to indicate, via a relational analogy, that other art bodies are probably associated with trance-related imagery. Briefly, the model identifies six entoptic forms or 'luminous percepts independent of light from an external source' (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988:202) commonly perceived by people in an ASC. These percepts are generated by the nervous system, and are therefore 'culture free' and common to all human beings in certain ASC regardless of their cultural background. Neuropsychological research undertaken since the 1920's has identified certain recurrent form elements, or entoptics, seen by subjects as incandescent, shimmering, moving and grading into one another. The six entoptics which feature in the neuro- psychological model are those most commonly described by neurologists and psychologists (see Fig.2). They are the grid, sets of parallel lines, dots and flecks, zigzags, nested catenary curves which may elaborate into a boat- shape, and filigrees or thin meandering lines. The model then describes seven general 'principles of perception', or ways in which entoptics and more iconic, culturally informed, hallucinations are seen. These are: replication, where the entoptic is seen in its fundamental form; fragmentation, where it is broken down into minimal components, for example the grid fragmented into a ladder- like form; integration, where forms blend to build up complex patterns; superimposition, the projection of one entoptic against another; juxtapositioning, where images appear side by side; reduplication, the duplication of a single image into a series; and rotation of the images in the field of vision (p.203). Iconic hallucinations are subject to the same principles of perception. Finally, there are three broad stages in the 'progression of mental imagery during altered states of consciousness* (p.203). In Stage 1 , entoptics are seen alone, in Stage 2 they may be construed as iconic forms as the subject attempts to make sense of them, and in Stage 3 a vortex or rotating tunnel is described, followed by the perception of true iconic hallucinations. Images perceived in Stage 3 are very vivid and are often associated with powerful emotional experiences. Entoptics may persist into this latter stage, perhaps as a background to the iconic imagery. The stages are '...cumulative rather than sequential' (p.204), and the latter two stages are culturally informed. Of interest is the phenomenon of synesthesia, or a confusion of the senses when in an ASC. During Stage 3, when subjects may believe themselves to actually be part of their hallucinations (participation), inhabiting a '...bizarre hallucinatory world' (p.211), they may confuse somatic sensations with mental imagery. Typically at this peak hallucinatory period subjects feel dissociated from their bodies, and may identify their own body parts and somatic sensations as visual percepts. For example, San shamans draw themselves with zigzag and spiral limbs, representing the trembling and pain experienced when in trance (pp.209, 211). The forms, principles and stages proposed in the neuro- psychological model are not the final word on this topic. For example, there are suggestions that as many as thirty entoptic f ι 1f 3 Q$) ^-^ V ^V ig ^-^ V 'I 500 mm t Figure 4. 'Climbing Men', upper panel. After Green (1982). 30</page><page sequence="10">forms can be described. However the model provides a very useful startíng point on which to hang analysis. The ethnographic evidence presented above establishes that Australian 'men of high degree' did utilise trance to perform supernatural functions. Due to the postulated 'hardwiring' of neurophysiology this means that they may have 'seen' entoptic phenomena. Indeed Coates' (1966) reference to magical crystals being inserted into shaman's eyes, where they can apparently be seen 'flickering ... inside, right in his eyes' (p. 115) recalls Lewis-Williams' and Dowson's (1988:202) definition of entoptic phenomena as 'visual sensations derived from the structure of the optic system anywhere from the eyeball to the cortex' which shimmer, rotate and move. This supports the notion that the percepts 'seen' are common to all shamans. The Pilbara narratives in particular describe hallucinatory visions while in a special (stage 3?) hurdu trance, and indicate that different levels of trance were entered to perform super-natural functions. Consequently it is possible to suggest that the Pilbara shamans would have seen entoptic phenomena, and that if these forms can be identified in the art, it arguably derived from shamanic experience. I will now analyse an art panel in terms of the neuro- psychological model to show how the model's potential may be realized. My aim here is to apply in order to evaluate. Future research may question the model's assumptions, or identify negative cases, where entoptic-like graphic images are found to be unrelated to shamanic experiences, but in the interim utility is potentially the model's most positive feature. The 'climbing men' panel The panel is located in a small valley on the Burrup Peninsula, Pilbara Region, Western Australia. The site is not associated with occupation debris and is isolated from other engraving concentrations on the Peninsula. It is inland, away from the resource-rich coastal areas where the Yaburara concentrated their exploitation activities, implying use by a few sequestered individuals. Motifs similar to the 'dot-headed figures' seen in this panel are found elsewhere on the Peninsula. There are no published data on these, but future analysis of their locations and associated motifs could establish further similarities with the panel in question. Burrup Peninsula art has received some attention from Dix (1977), Virili (1977), Turner (1981), Green (1982), Lorblanchet (1983), and Vinnicombe (1987, 1988). Of these Dix, Green and Vinnicombe illustrate the 'Climbing Men' panel, while Walsh (1988) has published an excellent photograph of it. Engravings on the Peninsula have not been directly dated, although the area does exhibit 'desert varnish', meaning that the cation-ratio method may be applicable (Dorn et al. 1988). However Lorblanchet (1983) has established that some of the art predates 3800 bp, by dating shells from a midden in Skew Valley which covered four engraved rocks. The oldest C14 date obtained from an archaeological survey on the Peninsula is 6750 ± 130 BP (Vinnicombe 1987:42). Figure 4 is taken from Green's (1982) reproduction of a photogrammetric recording. Areas depicted here in black are those portions of the granophyre rock which have been I III IV V VI I Ì* lit φϋ+ Λ*Ν íW· Figure 5.

I have numbered motif groups to facilitate discussion. Entoptic forms and principles of perception I here identify the various entopic forms which can be identified in the panel. Figures 4 and S illustrate examples. 1. Two variations on the 'climbing men' motifs, la and lb, indicate their possible entoptic derivation, la belongs to the first category of entoptic phenomena, the grid, under the principle of fragmentation into ladder-like form. It is integrated with entoptic category III, dots, lb illustrates this grid-dot integration more clearly. The remainder of the 'climbing men' motifs (lc - g) are interpreted as variations on this grid-dot entoptic theme. Id incorporates two anthropomorphs whose navicular bodies are examples of the fifth entoptic category, catenary curves, elaborated into boat- like shapes. Similarly, If incorporates reduplicated curves, entoptic V. 2. This motif can clearly be categorised as entoptic III, replicated dots. They are juxtaposed to an irregular shape not subsumed under the model. 3. The upper portion of this motif consists of catenary curves elaborated into navicular form (entoptic V), within which replicated curves are depicted, as are a few dots (entoptic III). Integration with more dots and other irregular shapes results in a more complex motif. 4. This motif is a simple replication of entoptic V, a single catenary curve. 5. The elongated anthropomorphic figure integrates and juxtaposes at least three, and arguably four, entoptic categories. The head is bracketed by a curve (entoptic V), the body is fringed with dots (entoptic III) and the legs consist of thin, meandering lines (entoptic VI). The upper body, chest, head and arms area can be seen as an undulating zigzag (entoptic IV). 6. This can be interpreted as a replicated undulating zigzag (entoptic IV). 7. This small 'circle plus line' motif is the only one not of itself entoptic, or arguably a variation on an entoptic derived motif. It is closely juxtaposed to a catenary curve. The presence of five of the six entoptic categories (grid, dots, zigzags, catenary curves, meandering line), under five of the seven principles of perception (replication, reduplication, fragmentation, integration, juxtaposition) suggests that this panel derives from an ASC experience. This is bolstered by the fact that the panel also indicates the various stages in the progression of ASC mental imagery. Stages in the progression of imagery Figure 6 demonstrates that all three stages in the progression of mental imagery when in trance are present in the 'Climbing Men' panel. Stage 1: Entoptics alone: Four of the entoptic motifs identified above occur replicated or reduplicated and depicted alone, without any iconic content: dots (motif 2), ENTOPTICl PRINCIPLES OF TYPE PERCEPTION III REPLICATION ·£ I r ω REPLICATION / J Λ Ö REDUPLICATION J CO I FRAGMENTATION ft^ FRAGMENTATION # [· &lt; ' FRAGMENTATION li # [· &lt; 3 III 111 E INTEGRATION OJ O REDUPLICATION HÖMft) INTEGRATION *^Z/ F INTEGRATION J*i JUXTAPOSITION £$' U LU CO Figure 6.

The only iconic images apparent in this panel are anthropomorphic. This presents the problem of distinguishing between a Stage 2 construal of entoptic forms as anthropomorphs, and a Stage 3 participation of the subject in his own hallucination, perhaps with background entoptics persisting. The occurrence of synesthesia provides the solution. If an anthropomorphic icon displays features suggesting confusion of trance-related somatic sensations (limb elongation, stomach pain) and visual imagery (entoptics) it refers to participation; if not, it can be more conservatively interpreted as a construal. Stage 2: Construal as Icon. Motifs la - g are construais of the fragmented grid or navicular curves,integrated with dots, as a formation of humanoid figures whose heads are disconnected from their bodies, ascending a line. Similarly, motif 3 can be seen as a construal of curves integrated with irregular shapes as a head, or face. Stage 3: Icons proper. Motif S depicts true hallucinations and participation, with a background of entoptics persisting (the fringing dots). The trance related illusion of limb elongation is depicted using the undulating zigzag (for the upper body) and thin meandering lines (for the legs), in a manner analogous to the San medicine man depicting his limbs as zigzags (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988:209). Omissions The irregular shapes associated with motifs 2, 3 and 7, cannot be classified according to the neuropsychological model, or be seen as variations on an entoptic-derived theme. However, they are neither numerous nor prominent, and do not detract from the strikingly entoptic nature of this panel. Interpretation The above analysis has shown that most of the features of this panel bear a formal resemblance to entoptic phenomena in the various transformations described by the neuropsychological model. Entoptics are claimed to be universalistic products of the human nervous system when in an ASC. Their prominence in this panel suggests it derives from trance experience. The ethnological literature indicates that utilisation of ASC was the forte of Australian medicine men, so it is reasonable to suggest that the panel was prompted by Australian shamanic practices. Trance was used by the Australian shaman to perform supernatural duties, and is especially implicated in their quest to attain power, distinguishing 'tribal' initiation from shamanic initiation proper: 'The great difference observable between these two types of initiation is the fundamental importance of the inner, ecstatic experience in the case of aspirants to the profession of medicinemen...' (Eliade 1964:65). Moreover, in this panel, few of the entoptics occur alone which would indicate an early stage of trance. Most are elaborated into iconic form, and the central anthropomorph arguably indicates the peak hallucinatory experience of participation. This implies that 'masters of ecstasy9 could indeed have been involved. Rose (1956:52) believed that the initiation of Aboriginal medicine men required profound (stage 3?), as opposed to milder, trance states. If this is so, the possibility that the panel depicts shamanic initiation becomes apparent. Although entoptics are universalistic, their apprehension during stages 2 and 3 in the progression of ASC mental imagery entails cultural screening and interpretation. So, in order to avoid reduction to neurophysiology, we must turn to the ethnology in an attempt to provide a more in-depth interpretation of one level of meaning of the panel. Certain concepts about Australian shamanism seem to be widespread across the continent, amongst different Aboriginal social and linguistic groups, in widely separated geographical regions. Narratives taken from a Ngaluma shaman indicate that many of these concepts were shared in the Pilbara region too, although specific reference to Ngaluma shamanic initiation is lacking. Nevertheless, the image of shamans utilising a magical cord for out-of-body travel does occur. In other regions the concept of the cord is intimately associated with ascent to the sky during shamanic initiation. This usage of the 'aerial rope' is attributed by Coate (1966) to Kariera-speaking shamans of Port Hedland in the Pilbara region. Nowhere in the ethnography are cords associated with a descent to the underworld. Shamanic initiations which include such images describe descent by being thrown, being swallowed, or diving (Eliade 1964; Elkin 1977). Wuradjeri shamans may issue the cord from their navel or testicles and gravitate, or climb upwards, as a show of ability, but this appears to be an individual performance (Eliade 1973). Mardudjara shamans may head a group of men on 'dream- spirit travels' astride a magical hairstring (Tonkinson 1978), but this image does not involve ascension. One of the prominent iconic features of the panel discussed here is the anthropomorphs attached to vertical lines, apparently ascending such cords. The portrayal of this image, together with the evidence for profound hallucinatory visions, suggests that this panel may, at one level, be interpreted as a depiction of a shamanic initiation scenario. The 'climbing men' motifs can be interpreted as shamanic novices, perhaps accompanied (even carried 'piggyback') by master shamans or spirit beings analogous to the rai, on an extracorporeal journey up a connecting magical thread to the sky realm. I propose that the decapitation of these figures is a deliberate artistic convention, perhaps a metaphor of out-of-body travel (a dissociation between mind and body). Motif 3 has been analysed in terms of its component entoptic features, and I suggested it was a construal of a face. Dix (1977) analysed facial representations in Pilbara art, including that of the Burrup, and concluded that depiction of two eyes was enough to identify an anthropomorphic face. Animal engravings occur in profile, often only showing one eye. Anthropomorphic faces only rarely showed noses and mouths. He opined that '...disembodied faces ... represented mythical spirit figures' (Dix 1977: 280). Motif 3 is such a 33</page><page sequence="13">disembodied face, with two eyes and a catenary curve as some sort of headdress, but with nose and mouth less well defined. Interestingly, the Ngaluma respect- language word for 'god' is translated by Von Brandenstein (1970:249) as 'face' . I therefore interpret motif 3 as a rendition of the super- natural being the novice encounters who is responsible for giving him shamanic powers and magical substances. This need not be some primal deity as Eliade (1973) proposes, but is probably some spirit closely associated with shamans, visible only to them, analogous to the Rainbow Serpent or rai of the Kimberley . I have already suggested that motif S illustrates synesthesia, a confusion of bodily sensations of elongation and pain with entoptic imagery. A sensation of somatic transformation is common amongst Australian shamanic postulants, and is necessary for their rebirth as a substantially altered, spiritually enhanced, person. It is accompanied by the insertion of magical substances, the power concentrate of the shaman and the basis of his extraordinary abilities. The dots fringing this motif could symbolise these spiritual substances, the quartz crystal and pearlshell which focuses the shaman's forces, as could the dots of motif 2. This interpretation is supported by an observation by Palmer (1977) who obtained information from contemporary Pilbara Aborigines on coastal Pilbara engravings. One of these engravings (see Fig.3, coastal entoptic III) depicts dots interpreted as 'magic stones to kill enemies' (Palmer 1977: 46). A similar object is also, arguably, depicted inserted in the stomach of the anthropomorph (see Fig.2 for other examples of dots inserted in or around an anthropomorph's body). Overall, motif 5 may illustrate that moment when, deep in the final stage of trance {kurdu trance?) the bodily transmuted and participatory novice, unable to divorce himself and what he is feeling from the visions he perceives, receives shamanic power. The drama and climactic nature of this moment is emphasised by the composition of the panel, which reflects a sequence of events. The ascensional motifs and depiction of the supernatural being flank the central, stage 3 focus of the panel, attainment of shamanic status. This engraving is spatially rather isolated from other engravings, and its situation away from occupation debris suggests it was a special function site. In keeping with the above interpretation I suggest that the site had a dual function - both as a venue for shamanic initiation, and as a preparation for the novices, leading them to expect certain visions and hallucinatory experiences. Elkin (1977:25) states that this occurred: '...he goes into a trance and sees all the correct, the suggested and the expected happenings', and 'Obviously the ... candidate is conditioned in body and mind for the traditional visionary experience' (p. 109). Lewis- Williams and Dowson (1988:210) note that in the culturally influenced stages of an ASC identification of what is being seen is '...constrained by the shaman's tradition and by what he is expected or desires to see'. The climbing men panel may well have functioned as such a prompt. Palmer (1975, 1977) has done ethnographic work in the Pilbara which establishes an intimate connection between rock engravings and the contemporary Aboriginal belief system. Engravings are said to represent the spiritual essence of their subjects (Palmer 1975), were seen as illustrative of Dreamtime events (Palmer 1977) and could invoke in informants connotations of specific rituals and song cycles. This serves as a timely reminder of the multivalency of engraved motifs, a semiotic characteristic evident in Morphy 's (1977) work on Northern Territory bark paintings. Aboriginal belief is hierarchical, and attainment of sacred knowledge depends on movement through a series of ceremonial and ritual processes. Similarly, Aboriginal art may encode a variety of levels of 'meaning', with the same motifs given different significances by different members of society, depending on their degree of esoteric knowledge (see Munn 1973). Pilbara ethnography is too sparse for all such connotations to be elucidated for the 'climbing men' panel. The 'trance' interpretation given in this paper should be seen as only one possible interpretation, an added dimension of meaning never considered before. Indeed, as shamanic initiation scenario and prompt the panel could represent a 'highest order' or level of meaning, commensurate with the shamanic specialists' attainment of the 'highest order' of initiation. At another level, the panel could hold connotations of more general male initiation. One of the rites of Bard and Ungarinyin male initiation, from which women are excluded, involves a post or tree ceremony (Elkin 1935). Newly circumcised men sit with bowed heads at the base of a pole while younger men shin up it and older men sing sacred songs. This image has obvious parallels with the 'climbing men' motifs of the panel discussed here. Circumcision was not practiced by the Yaburara, but it is possible that the panel has wider implications of 'changing status', or 'attainment of higher status' in the context of the overall cosmological system. Implications Using the neuropsychological model as a general theoretical framework (based as it is on a relational analogy), together with more formal analogy with relevant ethnographic information, I suggest a more in-depth interpretation for this panel than has been hitherto attempted. This same two- pronged approach should be possible in other regions of the continent, especially in those areas where the formal analogy can be substantiated by more historically direct ethnology, where less reliance need be placed on establishing widespread concepts and where more attention can be paid to unveiling the polyvalent symbolic connotations of specific graphic images. It would be interesting, for example, to look more closely at the role of 'pituri' use in areas where this psychoactive drug, capable of inducing trance-like states, was traded (Watson 1983), and tie this into a multivalent analysis of local art bodies. In conclusion, the neuropsychological model claims to explain more, and more varied, data than competing 34</page><page sequence="14">hypotheses, and to have predictive and heuristic potential. At the modest level of hypothesis application, that claim is supported here. A previously intractable panel from a fourth continent can be subsumed under its tenets, enabling more to be said about it than was possible before. A host of new questions arise from this exercise. The complexity of Aboriginal metaphysics is demonstrated yet again, and a previously unacknowledged level is added to Australian rock art interpretation, amplifying our understanding of this phenomenon. As a working model the hypothesis seems useful. It is open to expansion and refinements, enabling further assessment of the claim that entoptic phenomena are the 'signs of all times' (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988). References Bednarik,R.G. 1984.
