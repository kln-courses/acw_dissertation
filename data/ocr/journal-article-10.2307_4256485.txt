THE MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN OF MAIZE. Economic Botany 55(4):492-514, 2001. Domesticated maize emerged from human selection, exploitation, and cultivation of natural recombinants between two wild grasses that had novel characteristics desired by humans for food. Crossing experi- ments reconstructing prototypes of ancient archaeological specimens demonstrate how the sim- ple flowering spike of the wild relatives of maize was transformed into the prolific grain-bearing ear within a few generations of intergenomic recombination between teosinte and Tripsacum. The high degree of morphological similarities of segregating intercross progeny to archaeo- logical specimens from Tehuacdn, Oaxaca, and Tamaulipas provides strong support for this evolutionary scenario. Comparative genomic analysis of maize, teosinte, and Tripsacum con- firms that maize has inherited unique polymorphisms from a Tripsacum ancestor and other unique polymorphisms from a teosinte progenitor. This supports the hypothesis that Tripsacum introgression provided the mutagenic action for the transformation of the teosinte spike into the maize ear. This model for the origin of maize explains its sudden appearance, rapid evo- lutionary trajectory, and genesis of its spectacular biodiversity. Key Words: evolution of maize; Tripsacum; teosinte; archaeological maize. "In the future, as population pressure and our understanding of maize both increase, this crop's role as our symbiotic partner in survival will also increase. As the most intelligent species on the only planet known to contain life, it behooves us to use our intelligence not only to harmonize our symbiotic relationships with plants but with each other. . . (Galinat 1992:11) Maize (Zea mays L.), or corn as it is called in the United States, is one of three cereal grains upon which world civilizations were founded. It has been described as "having a passport without a birth certificate" (Wilkes and Goodman 1996) because, although it is one of the most widely grown food crops around the globe today, its precise parentage has been controversial. With over 200 land races indig- enous to Latin America (Brieger et al. 1958; Brown 1960; Grant et al. 1963; Grobman, Sal- huana, and Sevilla 1961; Hatheway 1957; Ra- mirez et al. 1960; Roberts et al. 1957; Timothy et al. 1961; Timothy et al. 1963; Wellhausen, Fuentes, and Hernandez C. 1957; Wellhausen et al. 1952), maize is phenomenally rich in ge- netic biodiversity. A study of botanical facsim- iles depicted on pre-Columbian pottery (Eu- banks 1999a) demonstrated that six of the 14 categories into which the land races have been grouped (Bird and Goodman 1977) have deep roots in antiquity. It has been estimated that over 90% of maize found archaeologically is cobs or cob fragments without kernels in place or in direct association with cobs (Lenz 1948). Therefore, most of what we know about prehistoric maize has been in- ferred from observable characteristics of cob macrofossils. Classification of maize is based on features of the ear with kernels in situ. Although some of the ear characters can be inferred from well-preserved cobs, there is still considerable ambiguity in identifications based on cob mor- phology alone (Bird 1970; Mangelsdorf, MacNeish, and Galinat 1967a). This limitation is overcome by ceramic models of maize that provide a unique window into maize evolution (Eubanks 1999a). Ancient potters made molds by pressing real maize ears into clay, then firing the negative impression (Fig. 1). They then fash- ioned positive casts by pressing damp clay into Economic Botany 55(4) pp. 492-514. 2001 C) 2001 by The New York Botanical Garden Press, Bronx, NY 10458-5126 U.S.A.</page><page sequence="2">2001] EUBANKS: MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN OF MAIZE 493 Fig. 1.

These botanical facsimiles of the natural ear provide the morphometric data that is essential for identifying the race of maize de- picted. This particular technique of using molds to produce maize replicas true to nature was em- ployed by two contemporaneous cultures, the Zapotec of the Valley of Oaxaca in Mexico and the Moche on the north coast of Peru (Fig. 2) during the Classic period (-200-900 A.D.). Both cultures regarded maize as the sacred source and sustenance of life. The Zapotec displayed maize on ceremonial urns representing revered ancestral figures bear- ing attributes of different deities in the Zapotec pantheon associated with growing maize. The figure was usually depicted in front of a cylin- drical container. These urns, often referred to as funerary urns, were placed in tombs or in niches on the outside of tombs. Figure 3 illustrates a Zapotec urn depicting an anthropomorphic fig- ure with attributes of the maize god, the God of Glyph "L," with maize ears in the headdress. The Moche depicted maize in association with their anthropomorphic creator god Ai-apaec (Fig. 4). Other Moche jars depict maize alone or Pue tfic Oceea Fig. 2.

These groups displayed naturalistic mold made maize on their ceremonial vessels. associated with a variety of animals including birds, frogs, fish, and rodents. Aided by numerical taxonomy in a study of 129 vessels with depictions of moldmade maize in museum collections in Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Europe, Eubanks (1999a) identified twenty land races in ten countries from the maize replicas (see cover illustration). In ac- cordance with the classification scheme of Bird and Goodman (1977), seven races identified on the pre-Columbian jars belong to two categories of pop corn; six types of flint/popcorns; one is in the Cuzco group; one is a Caribbean dent; one is a lowland flour maize, and four were not clas- sified by Bird and Goodman. This broad spec- trum of maize biodiversity that had developed as early as the Classic period can be traced as far back as preceramic times. Evidence for this was preserved iconographically by ancient Za- potec potters who frequently added stylized male flowers (staminate tips) to the naturalisti- cally depicted maize ears (Fig. 5). The signifi- cance of this as a clue for solving the mystery of the origin of maize becomes apparent as this story unfolds. The oldest maize cobs are over 6000 years old</page><page sequence="3">494 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 Fig. 3. Zapotec urn of anthropomorphic figure as- sociated with attributes of the maize god.

These tiny cobs (Fig. 6) have the basic characteristics that distinguish domes- ticated maize from its wild relatives. The hard fruitcases have converted to open cupules (cup- like structures) that expose the kernels; the glumes (basal bract of a grass spikelet) have be- come herbaceous like the male glumes as op- posed to indurated by lignification for protection of the grain; each cupule bears a pair of kernels instead of one, and the cupulate segments of the female flowering spike have fused to form a rig- id rachis, the cob. Most scientists agree that maize evolved from teosinte, a closely related wild grass also in the genus Zea that is endemic to Mexico where maize is believed to have originated. The great botanical mystery is how was the simple spike of teosinte with five to seven hard seeds (Fig. 7) so radically transformed into a struc- ture that is unparalleled anywhere else in the botanical kingdom, the highly prolific ear that produces hundreds of kernels (Fig. 8).

Although the hypothesis that teosinte was transformed into maize by gradual accu- mulation of mutations over thousands of years is currently the most widely accepted paradigm (Bennetzen et al. 2001; Smith 2001), a growing body of evidence indicates that the staple food</page><page sequence="4">2001] EUBANKS: MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN OF MAIZE 495 Fig. 5. Drawing of a maize ear with staminate tip as seen on Zapotec urns. This unusual feature that was preserved iconographically by ancient potters was an important clue to solving the mystery of the origin of maize. and sacred grain of prehistoric America is an introgressive polyploid that combines the germ- plasm of teosinte (Zea sp.) and gamagrass (Tripsacum sp.) (Eubanks 1995, 1997, 2001a, b; MacNeish and Eubanks 2000). If the latter interpretation is accurate, maize could have evolved by punctuated equilibrium (Gould 1984) within a few generations of human ex- ploitation and artificial selection. This paper is an interdisciplinary synthesis of the latest evi- dence from biosystematics, experimental cross- es, archaeology, and comparative genomics that points to a subtle, but dramatic, genetic leap forward that set the course for a rapid, com- plex, reticulate evolutionary trajectory inti- mately linked to human intervention, manipu- lation, cultivation, and dispersal. TAXONOMY AND CROSSABILITY Maize belongs to the Tripsacinae (syn. May- deae), a sub-tribe of the Andropogoneae (Steb- bins and Crampton 1961), a large tribe of trop- ical grasses that includes the other important economic plants sorghum and sugar cane. Like most grasses, the Tripsacinae are wind-pollinat- ed. A distinguishing characteristic for the Amer- ican members and Coix in the Orient is they are monoecious, i.e., the male and female flowers (spikelets) are borne separately on the same plant. In teosinte (Zea sp.) and gamagrass (Trip- --w Fig. 6. Primitive maize cob from Coxcatlan Cave in the Valley of Tehuacan. sacum sp.), the grain is borne inside a boney fruitcase composed of two indurated outer glumes. Generally, there are five to nine seeds on a spike that shatters upon maturity for natural dispersal. A distinct difference between Zea and Tripsacum is that in Zea the male (staminate) flowers are produced in their own inflorescence (the tassel) that appears at the tips of the stalks and sometimes at the tips of ears, and the female (pistillate) flowers usually develop separately terminating the lateral branches. On the other hand, in Tripsacum the male flowers are usually only borne directly above the female flowers on the same spike (Fig. 9). The flowering spikes with unisex divisions are produced on numerous tall canes all originating at ground level from the basal rosette of leaves. In contrast to the teosinte plant habit of multiple branches that produce tiny ears in the leaf axils, Tripsacum's flowering shoot provides a genetic preview of the single stalk of domesticated maize. Teosinte.-According to Iltis and Doebley (1980), the teosintes include three subspecies of Zea mays: Z. m. ssp. mexicana, Z. m. ssp. par- viglumis, and Z. m. huehuetenangensis; and three separate species: Z. luxurians, Z. diploper- ennis, and Z. perennis. Iltis and Benz (2000) re- cently reported teosinte from the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, and they have assigned it a new spe- cies name, Z. nicaraguensis. The teosintes are endemic to Mexico and Central America. Except for two rhizome forming perennials: the tetra- ploid Z. perennis and Z. diploperennis, the teo- sintes are annuals that must reproduce every year from seed. With the exception of the tet-</page><page sequence="5">496 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 Fig. 7. A flowering spike and mature seeds of te- osinte (Zea diploperennis). raploid Z. perennis, all have the same diploid chromosome number (n = 10) and readily re- combine with maize. Gamagrass.-Gamagrass, Tripsacum spp., is a rhizomatous perennial that ranges from eastern North America to South America. Cut- ler and Anderson (1941) recognized seven spe- cies, and two more were added a few years later (Randolph 1950; Randolph and Hernandez-X. 1950). Subsequent surveys of Tripsacum throughout Latin America expanded the genus to include as many as 16 species (Berthaud et al. 1997; Brink and de Wet 1983; de Wet et al. 1976, 1983; Gray 1974; Randolph 1976), each with a gametic chromosome number of n = 18. Most species have 36 or 72 chromosomes, but plants with up to 108 chromosomes have been reported. There are two sections of the genus: Tripsacum and Fasciculata. Section Tripsacum is distinguished by erect flowers and both mem- bers of the pair of male flowers are sessile (at- tached directly to the rachis). In section Fasci- culata, the inflorescences are pendulous, and like Zea, one member of the pair of male flow- ers is sessile, but the other one is pedicellate .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~....

The first successful crosses between Tripsacum and Zea were made by applying Tripsacum pollen to maize silks. Special pollination and embryo rescue techniques were required to recover hy- brid progeny (Mangelsdorf and Reeves 1939). (Maize X Tripsacum) hybrids have a high de- gree of sterility. Although the chromosome number most often reported in the literature for (maize X Tripsacum) progeny is 28 or 46, hy- brids with 20 chromosomes are also produced (James 1969). Numerous attempts were made to cross Tripsacum and teosinte (Mangelsdorf 1974; Tantravahi 1968), but none yielded via- ble progeny until the diploid perennial teosinte was discovered on the verge of extinction in the mountains of Jalisco, Mexico in the late 1970s (Iltis et al. 1979). Wilkes (1982) had the fore- sight to recognize that this new teosinte could possibly break the crossability barrier between Tripsacum and teosinte.</page><page sequence="6">2001] EUBANKS: MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN OF MAIZE 497 Fig. 9. Inflorescence of gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides) showing the male flowers above the fe- male flowers on same spike. EXPERIMENTAL CROSSES Although the chromosome number of this new perennial teosinte (Zea diploperennis Iltis, Doebley and Guzman) is the same as maize and the annual teosintes (2n = 20), its chromosomes resemble Tripsacum chromosomes in size and structure more closely than any of the Zeas. Eu- banks hypothesized that this similarity in chro- mosome architecture would enhance crossability between the two species, and conducted cross- ability tests between this unusual teosinte and its Eastern gamagrass cousin (Tripsacum dactyloi- des L.). Fully fertile recombinant progeny were recovered from replicated experimental crosses (Eubanks 1989, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996). The success of these crosses is significant for four reasons: (1) these are the first viable recombi- nants recovered from crossing teosinte and gam- agrass; (2) recombinant derivatives are fully fer- tile; (3) they are cross-fertile with maize and Reconstructed Prototype of Wild Maize Fig. 10.

Plants in a population of segregat- ing intercross progeny whose maternal lineage traced through Tripsacum produced ears (Fig. 11) with all the features of ancient maize (Benz 2001; Eubanks 2001 a, b; MacNeish and Eu- banks 2000; Mangelsdorf, MacNeish, and Gali- nat 1964, 1967a). They are small with four to eight rows of paired kernels in shallow cupules borne on a slender cob, and the kernels are en- closed individually by long, soft glumes. These plants are perennial, have 20 chromosomes, and</page><page sequence="7">498 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 Fig. 11.

Be- cause prototypes that closely match ancient specimens can be reconstructed experimentally by crossing diploperennis teosinte and gama- grass, it is hypothesized that domesticated maize emerged from human selection and cultivation of natural hybrids between teosinte and Tripsa- cum. ANCIENT MAIZE The question of the origin of maize involves biology and archaeology. In order to be mean- ingful, the findings of experimental research must be consistent with the archaeological rec- ord documenting maize evolution. Therefore, viewing the biological picture through the ar- chaeological lens is critical to bringing the mechanism of how teosinte was transformed into maize into sharper focus and alignment with the concomitant cultural developments intimate- ly connected with the biological evolutionary trajectory of maize. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD There is no evidence in the archaeological rec- ord for a long, gradual evolution during which the mutations that transformed teosinte into maize might have accumulated (Benz 1999). Segregating experimental (teosinte X gama- grass) crosses reveal that the transition from te- osinte to maize could have happened rapidly and may have required only a few generations of in- tercrossing. Therefore, the archaeological record is re-examined in light of the new biological ev- idence from experimental crosses. Ears pro- duced by some segregating F1 (teosinte X gam- agrass) progeny (Fig. 10) simulate a missing link in the evolutionary history of maize (Eubanks 1995, 1997, 2001a, b; MacNeish and Eubanks 2000). They have a pair of kernels in a single cupule like maize, and the cupulate segments do not break apart easily as they do in teosinte and Tripsacum. On the other hand, these first gen- eration recombinants lack other distinguishing features of maize: (1) the kernels are not fully exposed; (2) the glumes are not soft; and (3) they are not multi-ranked. Although the kernels are slightly exposed, they are still partially en- cased by hard outer glumes. Like maize, there is a pair of kernels in each cupule, but the rachis is two-ranked like teosinte and gamagrass. When I grew an F2 population of intercross re- combinants in which gamagrass was the mater- nal parent (Fig. 11), however, I recovered prog- eny with the features of early maize: paired ker- nels in open cupules; long, soft glumes; a multi- rowed cob; staminate tips on many of the ears. Different segregants from that population pro- duced ears that match macrofossils from Tehua- can, Oaxaca, and Tamaulipas. Tehuacan.-Cobs excavated from dry caves in the Valley of Tehuacain, originally radiocar- bon dated to -5000 B.C. (Johnson and MacNeish 1972), along with cobs from Guila Naquftz cave in the Valley of Oaxaca in southern Mexico that date to around 4200 B.C. (Piperno and Flannery 2001), are the earliest macrofossils of maize yet uncovered. The original Tehuacain '4C dates have been challenged by subsequent accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating of cobs in the col- lection at the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Historia Laboratorio PaleobotAnico Laboratory in Mexico City (Long et al. 1989). The AMS</page><page sequence="8">2001] EUBANKS: MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN OF MAIZE 499 Fig. 12.

Peabody Museum, Phillips Academy, Andover, MA. dates indicated the early cobs might be 1500 years younger than first reported, but concerns were raised about the AMS dates for a number of reasons (Flannery and MacNeish 1997; MacNeish 2001; MacNeish and Eubanks 2000). Since subsequent AMS dates on maize macro- fossils from Oaxaca (Piperno and Flannery 2001) and Zea pollen from Tabasco (Pope et al. 2001) securely place early maize in the range of 4000-5000 calendar years B.C., which aligns well with the original 14C dates, it is probable that the original date for the first appearance of maize in the Tehuacain Valley of around 7000 years ago is closer than more recently believed (Fritz 1994; Long et al. 1989; Long and Fritz 2001). The Tehuacain Valley macrofossils rep- resent the full spectrum of maize evolution (Fig. 12). They chart the transformation of the first cobs beginning around 5000 B.C. through the in- termediate stages of early cultivated maize, fol- lowed by early tripsacoid maize, and the devel- opment of the Nal Tel-Chapalote complex, late tripsacoid and slender popcorns that were pre- sent by 1500 A.D. when the Spanish arrived in the New World (Mangelsdorf, MacNeish, and Galinat 1964, 1967a). The earliest cobs from the Tehuacafn caves were remarkably uniform in size, ranged from 19 mm to 25 mm long, had four to eight rows of kernels surrounded by long, soft glumes on thin cobs with shallow cupules (Mangelsdorf, MacNeish, and Galinat 1964, 1967a). Note how</page><page sequence="9">500 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 Fig. 13.

Like many of the early Tehuacan specimens, it had a staminate tip (male flowers) on the same rachis above the kernels, a characteristic feature of gamagrass. Oaxaca.-Four primitive maize specimens were found just above Zone B 1 in Guila Naquitz rockshelter in the Valley of Oaxaca (Benz 2001; Flannery 1986). The Oaxaca specimens were examined by Richard I. Ford and George Bea- dle, both of whom agreed they were either (1) "maize-teosinte hybrids," or (2) "primitive maize" showing strong teosinte influence in its genetic background (Flannery 1986:8). One of these (Fig. 14e) may be the only known archae- ological ear with four ranks of single spikelets resulting from a pathway of decussate yokes producing four rows of spikelets. This pathway also appeared in ears of an F2 Tripsacum-teosin- te derivative in which Tripsacum was the ma- Fig. 14.

Both specimens have single spikelets in tri- angular fruitcases that are borne in yokes. Yok- ing is a precursor feature in the transition from the two-ranked, shattering fruitcases of the wild relatives to the many-ranked, fused rachis that forms the maize cob (Galinat 1970). Another Oaxaca specimen is of a two-rowed cob (Benz 2001). Similar two-rowed cobs were produced by segregants of the (teosinte X gamagrass) de- rivatives. AMS dating has determined these an- cient maize remains from Oaxaca are 6200 years old (Piperno and Flannery 2001). Since pollen with the morphological attributes of modem ex- amples of Tripsacum and Zea was found in the stratigraphic layers below these macrofossils (Schoenwetter and Smith 1986), it can be in-</page><page sequence="10">2001] EUBANKS: MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN OF MAIZE 501 Fig. 15. An archaeological specimen of Tripsacum from Tamaulipas (on right) compared to an extant inflo- rescence of Tripsacum dactyloides (on left). Archaeobotanical specimen, Harvard University Herbaria, Cam- bridge, MA. ferred that these specimens represent a segre- gating population of Tripsacum-teosinte recom- binants which were either being gathered in the wild, or were in the initial stages of domestic transformation into maize. This correlates with Beadle and Ford's interpretation of the speci- mens as "primitive maize that shows strong te- osinte influence in its ancestry." Tamaulipas.-The only site where Tripsa- cum (Fig. 15) and teosinte (Fig. 16) macrofossils have been found together is from dry caves in Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico (Mangels- dorf, MacNeish, and Galinat 1967b). This is sig- nificant because it is outside the biogeographic range of extant teosinte which is only found west of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range today. Along with the Tripsacum and te- osinte remains is a specimen that was originally described as a "maize-teosinte" hybrid because it had thicker stalks than teosinte and the rachis did not break apart like the shattering fruitcases of teosinte. However, Mangelsdorf and Galinat were not confident about this designation and the label accompanying the specimen reads "maize-teosinte hybrid?" These specimens do not resemble ears produced by crosses between maize and teosinte. Confounding features of these specimens are they have a single kernel per cupule like teosinte and gamagrass, but they have long, soft papery glumes like early maize, and they have non-shattering rachises. This was why Mangelsdorf and Galinat had doubts about whether the putative "maize-teosinte" hybrids were F, hybrids or segregates appearing in sub- sequent generations. The specimen they sug- gested might represent the ancestral form of maize is a perfect match for an inflorescence phenotype produced by a Tripsacum-teosinte segregant (Fig. 17). Based on stratigraphy, this hybrid evidently postdates maize and Tripsa- cum. Therefore, it apparently represents a seg- regant of the Tripsacum-teosinte ancestral maize prototype. North America.-Other archaeobotanical ev- idence for human use of gamagrass in prehistory is provided by large quantities of Tripsacum seeds recovered from rockshelters in eastern North America (Gilmore 1931). If they are con- temporaneous with associated AMS dated Che- nopodium seeds from Newt Kash Hollow, Ken- tucky (Smith 1992), gamagrass was being ex- ploited by North American hunter-gatherers by or before 1400 B.c. At the time of their discov- ery, paleoethnobotanist Melvin R. Gilmore won-</page><page sequence="11">502 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 _2S. Fig. 16. An archaeological example of teosinte from Tamaulipas (on right) compared to an extant inflores- cence of perennial teosinte (on left). Archaeobotanical specimen, Harvard University Herbaria, Cambridge, MA. dered why they were being gathered because he thought it would be too difficult to extract them from the hard seedcoat (1931). However, there is ethnohistorical documentation of Tripsacum for food. Indigenous inhabitants of the Florida Everglades frequently carry "a pocket full of fruit cases to chew when out on hunting trips" (Galinat and Craighead 1964). It is true the Trip- sacum grain is contained inside a hard cupulate fruitcase, but the edge of the outer glume does not overlap the inner glume as it does in teosin- te. Consequently, it is easy to extract the Trip- sacum kernel from the fruitcase with a simple tool or long fingernail (Fig. 18). Since gama- grass has three times the protein content of maize and teosinte (Bargman et al. 1988; Jack- son 1980), is delicious, and the kernels are as large as popcorn kernels, it is plausible that pre- historic hunters and foragers were exploiting the grain for food, as well as the plant for other uses. The leaves and fibers can be used to make mats, bags, baskets, sandals, cordage, nets, etc. Feasibility for introgression between teosinte, Tripsacum, and hybrids between them contrib- uting to the explosive evolution and wide radi- ation of maize biodiversity is underscored by human dispersals of plants beyond their natural ranges (Darwin 1845; Dunn 1983; Gilmore 1930; Yarnell 1965; Zeiner 1946). If, as indi- cated by experimental crosses and the archaeo- logical record, Tripsacum introgression initiated the mutagenic action leading to the transforma- tion of teosinte into maize, there should be ev- idence for this in the molecular signature of maize. Unique fragments of DNA that represent alleles (alternate forms of a gene, also referred to as polymorphisms) should be found in Trip- sacum and maize that are not present in teosinte. Now we explore the molecular archaeology of maize to search for new genetic evidence to shed light on this mystery. MOLECULAR ARCHAEOLOGY EARLY MOLECULAR STUDIES When molecular tools began to be employed for elucidating the evolutionary histories of plants in the 1980s, the early evidence was from isozyme (an enzyme with different forms but similar chemical properties) studies (Doebley et</page><page sequence="12">2001] EUBANKS: MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN OF MAIZE 503 Fig. 17.

Analysis of 13 isozymes in maize and teosinte indicated that maize was most closely related to an annual teosinte endemic to the Balsas River drainage of Guerrero in southwestern Mexico (Z. m. ssp. parviglumis). Although a valid explanation of these data is they signal recent introgression be- tween maize and extant teosinte, Doebley (1990) interpreted this early molecular evidence as proof that maize descended directly from par- viglumis teosinte. Subsequent DNA studies have confirmed: (1) a close relationship between te- osinte and maize (Buckler and Holtsford 1996; Zimmer, Jupe, and Walbot 1988); (2) a close re- lationship between teosinte and Tripsacum (Lar- son and Doebley 1994); (3) a Tripsacum endem- ic to Central America is a hybrid between Trip- sacum and Zea (Talbert et al. 1990); (4) exten- sive introgression between maize and teosinte (Gaut and Clegg 1993); (5) the genetic diversity of prehistoric maize is comparable to modern maize (Goloubinoff, Paabo, and Wilson 1993); and (6) specific molecular markers are linked to four or five genes that distinguish maize from teosinte (Doebley 1992; Doebley et al. 1990; Doebley and Stec 1991; Doebley, Stec, and Gus- tus 1995; Dorweiler et al. 1993).

It can also be used to analyze phylogenetic relationships, ge- netic diversity, and evolution of genome struc- ture (Doebley and Wendel 1989; Jansen, Wee, and Millie 1998; Kellogg and Birchler 1993). To address the question of Tripsacum introgression into Zea, RFLP genotyping was employed for comparative genomic analysis of the teosintes, several Tripsacum species, as well as ancient in- digenous land races and modern maize inbreds. If maize derived from recombination between two or more progenitors, the maize fingerprint should contain fragments of DNA that are found exclusively in the molecular signatures of each ancestral taxa as well as fragments that are shared among the taxa. If maize and Tripsacum share a substantial number of unique polymor- phisms at many genetic loci dispersed through- out the genome (all of the genetic material car- ried by a cell or individual) that are not present in teosinte, it will provide robust evidence in support of the hypothesis that maize arose as a result of intergenomic recombination between teosinte and Tripsacum. On the other hand, if maize is descended directly from teosinte, most of the polymorphisms found in maize should be present in teosinte and few if any will be shared with Tripsacum. The important distinction of RFLP genotyping is the bands visualize patterns of DNA (deoxy- ribonucleic acid, the hereditary material) rather than proteins as in isozyme analysis. The pro- cedures in RFLP genotyping are as follows: (1) extraction of genomic DNA from plant tissue (usually leaves); (2) incubation of the genomic DNA with restriction enzymes (molecular scis- sors) that cut the nucleotides (the basic building blocks of DNA) only where there is a precise sequence in the DNA code; (3) transfer of di- gested DNA into wells in an agarose gel matrix; (4) separation of the DNA fragments by size (molecular weight) as they migrate through the gel when an electric current is applied (electro- phoresis); (5) transfer of the DNA fragments to a membrane called a Southern blot; (6) hybrid- ization of radioactively labeled RFLP probes to the Southern blot; (7) visualization of the pattern of bands that light up wherever a genomic DNA fragment carries the same DNA sequence as the RFLP marker on an x-ray film (autoradiograph). The bands, referred to as polymorphisms, reveal an individual's genotype at any given locus.

The 140 probes (Fig. 19) used in this study pro- vide a thorough screen of the Zea genome. For more information visit the Maize Genome Da- tabase web site (http://www.agron.missouri.edu/ probes.html). The high stringency of the hybrid- ization conditions restricts RFLP probes to pair- ing only with those fragments of genomic DNA that contain a homologous DNA sequence. Be- cause of the precision and accuracy of RFLP genotyping (Helentjaris, Weber, and Wright 1988; Melchinger et al. 1991; Smith and Smith 1991), it is routinely used by industry and gov- ernment for quality control, parentage verifica- tion, and to monitor pedigree purity. The advan- tage of RFLP genotyping over DNA sequencing in population and phylogenetic studies is that in contrast to comparison of DNA sequences at a single genetic locus, it allows a large number of sites scattered throughout the genome to be screened (Jansen, Wee, and Millie 1998). In an experiment investigating efficacy of RFLP anal- ysis compared to DNA sequences for four genes, the RFLP data produced the correct phylogeny; the DNA sequence data did not (Hillis, Huelsen- beck, and Cunningham 1994). COMPARATIVE GENOMICS Five to 13 individuals of each taxon listed in Table 1 were sampled for analysis. The teosin- tes, Tripsacum species, and races of maize were genotyped using 140 RFLP probes mapped to the ten linkage groups of maize (Fig. 19). The genomic DNA was isolated using a standard protocol (Helentjaris, Weber, and Wright 1988), digested with one of four restriction enzymes (EcoRI, EcoRV, BamHI or HindIII), separated by gel electrophoresis, and transferred to South- ern blots that were hybridized with 140 radio- actively labeled probes (Fig. 19). The autoradio- graphs were digitized and scored using the ProRFLP software program and the digitized data were converted into an Excel file. The au- toradiographs were then checked visually to ver- ify accuracy of digitized results. Each locus pro- duced a number of bands of varying molecular weights. RFLP genotyping of the same acces- sions with the same probes was conducted by two different commercial laboratories (Bioge- netics Inc., Brookings, SD, and Linkage Genet- ics Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) to independently cross check results. The restriction fragment data were tabulated by molecular marker/restriction enzyme combi- nation for every taxa and examined to determine how many polymorphisms are shared between Tripsacum and Zea (see Table 2). Bands are shared between Tripsacum and Zea at 129 of the 140 molecular marker loci. Thus, 92% of the loci tested yield evidence of Tripsacum intro- gression in Zea. Out of all 140 loci, maize has a total of 456 polymorphisms that are present in teosinte and/or Tripsacum. Of those 456 poly- morphisms, 92 (20.2%) are unique to maize and Tripsacum; 166 (36.4%) are unique to maize and teosinte, and 198 (43.4%) are present in both Tripsacum and teosinte. It can be inferred that polymorphisms uniquely shared between Trip- sacum and maize were likely derived from a Tripsacum ancestor, and polymorphisms unique- ly shared between teosinte and maize were ap-</page><page sequence="17">508 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 TABLE 3. GENETIC LOCI OF KEY TRAITS DISTINGUISHING MAIZE AND TEOSINTE. Trait Designation Chromosome RFLP Markers Teosinte branched I tbl IL UMC107, UMC140 Two-ranked ear trl 2S UMC6, UMC61 Terminal ear 1 tel 3L UMC102, BNL6.06 Teosinte glume architecture 1 tgal 4S UMC42, BNL5.46 Multiple controlling effects 5S TDA66, UMC27 parently inherited from a teosinte progenitor. Polymorphisms shared among all three taxa could have derived from either a teosinte or a Tripsacum ancestor. PRIMORDIAL GENES OF MAIZE Genes involved in the morphological trans- formation of the teosinte spike into the maize ear are believed to map to five regions of the maize genome. It has been postulated that these regions of major effects contain tightly linked genes that affect a single trait (Mangelsdorf 1974), or they represent individual loci with pleiotropic (a single gene controlling the ex- pression of several, seemingly unrelated observ- able characteristics) effects on more than one trait (Beadle 1939). Through genetic analyses using molecular markers Doebley (1992) and his collaborators (Doebely et al. 1990; Doebley and Stec 1991; Doebley, Stec, and Gustus 1995; Dorweiler et al. 1993) have identified specific RFLP probes linked to these putative loci (see Table 3). If maize descended directly from teo- sinte, maize and teosinte should have a high fre- quency of the same polymorphisms for these particular loci. A segment of the long arm of chromosome 1 has a trait referred to as teosinte branched 1 (tbl) that was involved in the reduction of the many-branches of teosinte to the single stalk of maize (Burnham 1961; Doebley and Stec 1995). At the UMC107 marker for this locus, maize shares a unique polymorphism with teosinte and none with Tripsacum; whereas at the UMC140 marker for tbl, maize and Tripsacum share a unique polymorphism and maize and teosinte do not (refer to Table 2 and Fig. 19). A second lo- cus on the short arm of chromosome 2, two- ranked ear (trl) is involved in the switch from the two-ranked (distichous) arrangement of the teosinte and Tripsacum spikes to the many- ranked, yoked (decussate) arrangement of the maize ear (Langham 1940). At the loci linked to trl, maize and teosinte share a unique polymor- phism at UMC6 that is not present in Tripsacum, but at UMC 61, maize and Tripsacum share a unique polymorphism not in teosinte (refer to Table 2 and Fig. 19). A third locus on the long arm of chromosome 3, terminal ear 1 (tel) is involved in reduction of branch intemodes that produces an axillary ear rather than a long, tas- sel-tipped branch (Doebley, Stec, and Gustus 1995; Matthews, Grogan, and Manchester 1974). For tel, maize and teosinte share two unique polymorphisms at the UMC102 locus, and maize and Tripsacum share a unique poly- morphism at BNL6.06 (refer to Table 2 and Fig. 19). A fourth gene referred to as teosinte glume architecture I (tgal) is responsible for the change in the hard fruitcase encasing the teosin- te grain to the open cup-like structure holding a pair kernels of maize subtended by thin, papery glumes (Doebley, Dorweiler, and Kermicle 1992). The UMC42 marker for tgal reveals maize and teosinte share a unique polymorphism at this locus, and at its neighboring locus NP1386 maize and Tripsacum share a unique polymorphism (refer to Table 2 and Fig. 19). The fifth region of major effect is on the short arm of chromosome 5 which affects traits for inflorescence architecture (Doebley and Stec 1991). Molecular marker TDA66 which maps to this region of chromosome 5 has three poly- morphisms unique to maize and Tripsacum and none unique to maize and teosinte. For marker UMC27 maize shares one unique polymorphism with Tripsacum and one with teosinte (refer to Table 2 and Fig. 19). These molecular findings clearly show that the major traits distinguishing maize from teosinte are a composite of alleles from teosinte and Tripsacum, indicating domes- ticated maize is a product of intergenomic re- combination. Comparative analysis of the DNA fingerprints thus provides support for the hypothesis that do- mesticated maize arose from recombination be-</page><page sequence="18">2001] EUBANKS: MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN OF MAIZE 509 tween one or more ancient populations of teo- sinte and Tripsacum. A close examination com- paring the fingergprints for RFLP markers mapped to the five regions associated with the major effects in the transition from teosinte to maize reveals that in each of those five chro- mosome segments maize has at least one DNA fragment inherited from teosinte and one from Tripsacum. Domesticated maize is clearly a composite of the genomes of teosinte and Trip- sacum. These findings are congruent with results of experimental crosses between Tripsacum and diploid perennial teosinte and the archaeological record documenting maize evolution. CONCLUSIONS Crossing experiments reconstructing proto- types of ancient archaeological specimens dem- onstrate how the teosinte spike could have been transformed into the maize ear in a few gener- ations of intergenomic recombination between teosinte and Tripsacum directed by human se- lection. The morphological similarities of inter- cross recombinants to macrofossils from Tehua- can, Oaxaca, and Tamaulipas support this inter- pretation. Comparative genomic analysis of maize, teosinte, and Tripsacum indicates maize has unique polymorphisms most likely inherited from a Tripsacum ancestor, and other unique polymorphisms apparently derived by descent from a teosinte progenitor. This supports the hy- pothesis that maize originated from natural re- combination between the genomes of teosinte and Tripsacum, and resolves discrepancies be- tween the biological evidence and the archaeo- logical record. In her profound insight of a phenomenon she described as genomic shock, Nobel laureate Bar- bara McClintock observed: "new species can arise quite suddenly as the aftermath of acciden- tal hybridizations between two species belong- ing to different genera" (McClintock 1984). The sudden appearance of maize and its rapid bio- diversity radiation within a few millennia as wit- nessed in the archaeological record (Eubanks 1999a) can thus be explained by human selec- tion for mutations resulting from genomic reor- ganization in response to the shock induced by intrusion of alien DNA into the Zea genome. The chromosomal rearrangements that permit formation of fertile progeny in crosses between perennial teosinte and Eastern gamagrass are precise and recur (Eubanks 2001 a). Viable plants are produced as a result of precise geno- mic reorganization involving chromosome trans- locations and fusions that yield the same chro- mosome number as Zea. Eubanks (1999b) has demonstrated the mutations that give rise to nov- el phenotypes seen in early archaeological maize are rapidly fixed and stably inherited in subse- quent generations. Therefore, human selection and cultivation of plants with the recombinant genomes of ancestral populations of these wild grasses could have led to the quantum speciation of domesticated maize within a few generations as proposed by Gould (1984). This synthesis of the biological evidence is consistent with the ar- chaeological picture in which the oldest remains have all the characteristics that distinguish maize from its wild relatives. It is supported by mac- rofossil evidence from Tehuacain, Oaxaca, and Tamaulipas. The variability in archaeological cob morphology is consistent with intergenomic recombination and introgression during the early stages of maize domestication. Natural hybrids bearing the primordial genes of the grain that would revolutionize human subsistence strate- gies in American prehistory first appeared in Mexico over 6000 years ago. By integrating to- tal evidence from molecular systematics, exper- imental breeding, morphology, and archaeology in future research, it should be possible to more accurately predict: (1) where and when maize first emerged; (2) who the original cultural and biological players were; (3) if there were poly- phyletic origins involving more than one species of teosinte and/or Tripsacum; and (4) how and in what directions maize agriculture spread. Humanity's symbiotic partnership with nature that led to the domestication of maize thousands of years ago has ultimately transformed the American biocultural and physical landscape. The closer we come to solving its myterious or- igin, the greater our ability to sustain and reap rewards from our interdependent relationship with America's golden grain will be.
