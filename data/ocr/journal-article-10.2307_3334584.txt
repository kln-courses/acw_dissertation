<plain_text><page sequence="1">Many of our long-term readers will recall that in Volume I, Number 2, we published a description of the Shona Sculptors' Workshop directed by Frank McEwen. Recently, representative sculpture from this group was displayed in the prestigious surroundings of the Musee Rodin in Paris. Claire Polakoff reported on this significant exhibition in Volume V, Number 3 of African Arts. This exhibition acted as a reminder to the editor. Recognizing the bitter international discussion that surrounds the political circumstances of present-day Rhodesia, we wrote to Frank McEwen, renewing old contacts and asking whether the current situa- tion was eroding the opportunities for the work of the Sculpture School. We received the following report, accompanied by fine photographs of new carving from the most able of this group. SHONA ART TODAY FRANK McEWEN Since Ulli Beier described our striving Workshop enthusiastically in his Contemporary Art in Africa, and since my last article in African Arts (Vol. I, No. 2), powerful progress has been crowned with success. Sculptures in harder and harder stone are produced; some weigh several tons. A show of 100 carvings ter- minated in Paris' Musee Rodin in November, 1971. It may seem mercenary to dwell upon the material suc- cess of this exhibition, yet that is double evidence of support, both financial and aesthetic. All except two sculptures were bought by known collectors, among whom was the distinguished connoisseur Charles Ratton. This type of breakthrough keeps our self- supporting Workshop physically alive. This is a new art. Apart from the stone carvings of Zimbabwe (ca. 1500 A.D.), there seems to have been almost no carving in this region. Artistic spirit of the area had been displayed only in its superb music. But in the last fifteen years true sculptors have arisen. With increasingly meaningful purpose and a sense of the mysterious powers of stone, they have transmuted life-force into crystal rock. The Shonas, five million strong, are traditionally deeply reflective, gentle, mystically inclined, and armed protectively with enduring patience. The older people live on the land retaining mystical belief: a deep involvement in the magical world of ancestor and tribal spirits. Here is a full-time commitment, one incapable of adaptation to Western concepts of mea- sured time, of constant motion, of the brain-washed, compartmentalized mind. Western man tends towards impoverished concepts of the two-dimensional; origi- nal man lives in a realm of the third- and fourth- dimensions. A Shona artist may not thrive as a dis- placed person. In foreign environments, because of his belief, he loses vital contact with his spirit world. Revered spirits of the renowned dead inhabit Muhacha trees, hills, kopjes or sanctuaries among local tribal regions. Honor is paid to the dead to comfort them and keep them benign. Their advice and protection are sought, for they intercede with Mwari the one God. Today, the Shona artist awakening to a need of self- expression marks his presence in a new domain by drawing from his rich inheritance of vision. From the myths, religion and symbolism of the ancients come his subjects, the results of meditation, of dream or day- dream. For him, each motif exists three-dimensionally, in visual thought. Individual styles range from bleak, archaic forms to evolved aesthetic sophistication. Carved with rapid, unhesitating execution, visual thought is transfused into the complete blocked-out sculpture, a form that is complete because the thought is now incarnate in the stone. The varied themes and subjects of contemporary Shona sculpture are deeply embedded in myth and memory. Tsuro is a benign, imaginary spirit-creature who offers sympathetic company and protection to the believer. He is envisaged as a composite being and may incorporate attributes of man, hare, baboon, buck, bird, or ant-bear. The Zuzu and the Haka, unlike the benign Tsuro, are vehicles of evil acting against man and his beneficial communications with spirits. The revered Baboon Man, or faith in a baboon spirit pos- sessed of certain knowledge, goes back to ancient Egypt to the baboon emanation of the God Toth. Baboons appear in song, dance, and art, in most parts of animist sub-Saharan Africa. They are found far back in history; if not yet traced in Nok culture, they do appear in Ife art. The Skeletal Myth asserts that the skeleton of a once important being may be tempo- rarily possessed by partial incarnation for communica- tion with the living. The Eye Concept derives from a belief once found widely among so-called "primitive" peoples, that man's life, his acts and thoughts, are con- stantly observed by unseen powers. If the eye of the ancestor is upon him, he will not escape detection. The Tree Image of the ancestral Muhacha tree has many variations in Shona sculpture.

BLACK SERPENTINE. 44". how similar forms occur in art of a very different and ancient origin: the tree images found in rock paintings, the petroglyphs of this region. There exist innumerable other elements that make the basis of Shona sculpture. These may derive from simple mythical or complex anthropomorphic and zoo- morphic themes. Subjects such as the popular winged figure or angel, bird spirits, bird men, bats, owls, chameleons, totemic protection figures, orjanus heads, seem associated with antique symbolism that reaches back to similar concepts in Mediterranean antiquity. It is clear that symbolism, although deriving from an individual culture, is rarely solely localized in its suggestiveness. If Shona art uses the symbolism de- rived from its tradition, it also incorporates elements that have far wider and more common association. Universal symbolism is present in the "spiral of evolu- tion," the "interlace" with aquatic waves or lines pro- jecting force, the "hand" of creativity projecting psychic power, the "solar disc" source of energy, symbols of growth and life-force, the magic power sign of the horn on the head, akin to our medieval unicorn. In this sculpture, as in other African art, the head is habitually enlarged, for that indicates the significant location where the Spirit resides. General to sub-Saharan Africa is the chevron symbol, while the sign of circles appears to be of local origin. 10</page><page sequence="4">For the most part, Shona artists sculpturally re- count their visions, their waking or sleeping dreams, but there are certain cases where subjects of tra- ditional belief are replaced by art-for-art's-sake con- cepts. The most notable creator in this domain is Nicolas Mukonberanwa. His work, often of an archi- tectural nature, utilizes his own personal, rather than traditional, symbolism. He carves round eyes for innocence, or makes the fusion of bodies denote the unity of souls through love. John Takawira is the most powerful master of mythical and magical themes. He recreates a whole range of skeletal beings infused with life. Sylvester Mubayi, recipient of the Ernest Oppenheimer Trust Award for Sculpture in 1969, is an artist of many parts. He carves with consummate skill, knowledge and an innate feeling for stone. His concepts range from the tender rendering of children enveloped in slumber, to expressionistic depictions of animal life and the mythical, skeletal beings. This essay deals with artists who have been attached to the Workshop for more than ten years, together with younger men recently joined who have already made their impact on the work of the group. The constant aim for these artists is quality. Many of our original team have dropped away into silence, or worse, joined the ranks of commercial imitators. Such imitators in- undate the field with an even more dishonest type of "airport art" which is vulgarly promoted by non- African exploiters. Fake production is already borrow- ing the most patent devices developed at the Work- shop in the expectation that the distinction earned by successful artists will somehow sustain the common- place work of the meretricious hack. But the material of the region requires a special artistic dedication. The discovery of harder and more beautiful dark stone with red and yellow and green colorations, commits the carver to a stronger and more permanent image than one produced from soft soap- stone. The technical challenge of carving in the hardest media has the value of uniqueness. It cannot be copied economically by the fabricants of curios. From a rich inherited potential, and through the con- stant protection of the National Gallery of Rhodesia, great Shona sculpture will progress as long as dedi- cated artists, and perhaps enlightened collectors and promoters, recognize the purity of its aesthetic inten- tion. The universal history of art records in other circumstances precisely that relationship, of higher or lower understanding between creators and con- sumers. Provided that the artists' vision is main- tained, true and untrammelled, the triumph of the Rodin exhibition will be repeated. O NICHOLAS MUKONBERANWA, SLEEPING FAMILY.
