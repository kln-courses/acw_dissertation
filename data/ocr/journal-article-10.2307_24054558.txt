Blackwell Science, Oxford, U.K. 717 pp. Paper: ISBN 0-632-03639-7, Â£29.50 As indicated in the blurb on its cover, the second edition of this multi-authored text on plant ecology has been restructured and completely revised, indeed almost to the point of losing its identity with the first (1986) edition. With six more chapters (now nineteen) and also six more contributors (also now nineteen) than in the first edition the changes may seem more apparent than real, but such is not the case; in fact only eight authors have contributed to both editions and there are eleven new contributors and seven from the original group who do not appear in this greatly enlarged second edition (717 vs 496 pages). Although extremely well written and documented - there are some 2,300 references, almost twice the number in the first edition - this book is not an integrated text on plant ecology. Rather it is a series of essays of quite varying detail and length ( 12-74 pages: with all four that exceed 50 pages being contributions from its editor) that are also of varying relevance to the broad field of plant ecology. In fact the book gives an initial impression of being more of a treatise on plant physiology now that its first three chapters have been rearranged to deal with photosynthesis, plant water relations, and nutrient acquisition. There are also others dealing with plant secondary metabolism, pollination and seed dispersal, seed dormancy, and sex that are somewhat more peripheral perhaps than some other issues of plant ecology that are not covered in any detail in this text, e.g. biomes, soils, and primary productivity. However, there are also excellent chapters on life history and environment, mechanisms of plant competition, the structure of plant populations, plant-herbivore dynamics, plant population dynamics, the dynamics of plant communities and plants in trophic webs. Three of the eleven new chapters, as the blurb highlights, address topical applied issues in plant ecology: pollution, climate change and biodiversity. Many of the authors, but particularly the main contributor-editor, have made a real effort to encourage the readers by some extremely clever and witty, if often highly anthropomorphic, introductory sections to their chapters. Those on sex and biodiversity are among the most notable but unfortunately limitations of space preclude adequate quotations.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 109 One cannot fail to be impressed with the wealth of information packed into most chapters which has added to the difficulty of achieving a comprehensive general index free of errors. It is gratifying to see New Zealand included here if only for one item since ecological research in New Zealand is often overlooked in texts obviously tailored to the very much larger northern hemisphere market. Closer perusal, however, revealed references to New Zealand in three other sections. One dealing with "problem plants" actually lists only Pinus radiata as a problem tree in this country, a claim some but surely not all readers would agree with. Unfortunately, as with much other information in the book, its source is not cited. Elsewhere, Pilosella officinarum (i.e. Hieracium pilosella) is given as a problem perennial herb of "pastures in New Zealand overgrazed by rabbits and sheep". We are also told (p. 627) that "in New Zealand, about 70% [of our threatened plant species] are in permanent protected areas managed to benefit the biota, while 11 % of threatened species have no effective protection in the wild." Again the information is not sourced, but the figure of 70% is unreasonably high and is given without qualification; nor is the remaining 19% accounted for. New Zealand also receives a mention, not surprisingly, in a typically concise, but comprehensive section dealing with mast fruiting and predator satiation in the chapter on "plant-herbivore dynamics". While clearly not an introductory text, this book is being correctly promoted as a benchmark text purporting to show how pattern and structure at different levels of plant organisation from ecophysiology through population dynamics to community structure and ecosystem function are influenced by a range of factors including competition and herbivory. Although the content and arrangement of the book is unlikely to suit most courses in plant or general ecology, as a prescribed text, I am aware it is being recommended for at least one course in plant ecology and it will certainly provide valuable supplementary information for many others. As such, this new edition can be justified for inclusion in any comprehensive ecological library collection, public or private. Alan F. Mark Department of Botany University of Otago P.O.
