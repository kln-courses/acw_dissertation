<plain_text><page sequence="1">U.S. Efforts to Protect Cultural Property Implementation of the 1970 UNESCO Convention MARIA PAPAGEORGE KOUROUPAS On October 12-14, 1994, in Bamako, Mali, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) held a Regional Workshop on the Illicit Traffic of Cultural Property. The following remarks by the Executive Director of the USIA's Cultural Property Advisory Committee offered participants insight into the U.S. experience within the framework of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. his Bamako workshop has been called to examine a problem that is epi- demic in scope, seemingly immune to any remedy, and on a scale that many agree is second to the trade in drugs: the illicit movement of cultural prop- erty across international borders. Perhaps, however, we should cast the problem differently. Our primary aim is not to curtail illicit trade but rather to protect the integrity of the object by finding ways to prevent its illicit and unscientific removal from its original context. Where an object of cultural significance ultimately resides may be important, but vastly more important is documentation of the archaeological or ethnographic record upon removal from context. Restricting illicit trade in cultural property within a treaty framework is a legal means toward achieving this end. As anyone who sees the exhibition "Valles du Niger" at the Musee National du Mali real- izes, objects without provenance do not speak, and without meaning they stand in flawed beauty. Background The 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property establishes a framework for international cooperation to reduce the incentive for pillage by restricting the illicit movement of archaeological and ethnographic material across international bound- aries. We believe that United States' implementation of the Convention has rendered it operational; for now, art-rich nations, such as Mali, that have suffered vast losses to their national cultural patrimony through looting and unauthorized trade, have access to some relief. The U.S. implements the 1970 UNESCO Convention by working with other State Parties to the Convention to minimize the problems of pillage and illicit export. The 32 african arts * autumn 1995</page><page sequence="2">underpinning of this readiness is in a statement issued at the time of ratification of the Convention. In part, it reads: There has been an expanding trade in archaeological and [ethnographic] artifacts deriving from clandestine activities and excavations that result in the mutilation of ancient centers of civilization.....The appearance in the U.S. of important art objects of suspicious origin has often given rise to outcries and urgent requests for return. The U.S. considers that on grounds of good foreign relations it should render assistance. In following this pol- icy, we are motivated also by ethical and moral principles.... The United States is the only major art-importing country to ratify the Convention. Our enabling legislation, the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, authorizes the President to receive requests from other State Parties seeking U.S. import controls on certain archaeological or ethnographic material. These requests include documentation that the national cultural patrimony is in jeopardy from pil- lage; that the requesting country has put in place internal protective measures; that the U.S. is a market for the material in question; and, if applicable, that certain emergency conditions obtain. In other words, the requesting country puts forth as compelling a case for import restrictions as possible; and in so doing, a cooperative relationship evolves between the U.S. and the art-source country. U.S. protection under the Act is prospective. While our implementing legislation pro- vides for interdiction, it is more an instrument of prevention. Its emphasis is not the recovery of past losses but rather the protection of cultural property that remains in situ in the country of origin-the undocumented material that, when stripped of its provenience, feeds a large clandestine trade that brings high yield with little risk to its participants. Most vulnerable are those countries where there is a large universe of unexcavated sites; where the cultural patrimony is provided little in the way of finan- cial resources and skilled personnel to preserve it; and where protective measures may be inadequate, not enforced, or unenforceable. Each request is evaluated through an advisory and decision-making process on a country-by-country basis. Except in instances of the theft of articles of cultural proper- ty that are accounted for in museum inventories or other records, the U.S. enabling leg- islation offers no automatic protection to other countries. It is, therefore, incumbent on an individual State Party to the Convention to submit a request seeking the protection of U.S. import restrictions on archaeological material that may yet be unearthed or ethnographic material that remains in its societal context. Enforcement of such controls by the United States is significant, for it essentially removes a major art-consuming nation from the marketplace. This has the effect of legitimizing the export controls of the requesting country, since the United States does not otherwise enforce the export controls of another country. U.S. Action under the Cultural Property Implementation Act The United States Information Agency (USIA) is the foreign affairs agency largely responsible for implementing U.S. participation in the 1970 UNESCO Convention. It not only administers the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, but also carries out most of the President's executive responsibilities under the Cultural Property Implementation Act. The Director of the Agency, on behalf of the President, has received requests for Department of the Treasury Customs Service 19CFR Part 12 (T.D. 93-74) Import Restrictions Imposed on Significant Archaeological Artifacts From Mali AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury ACTION: Final Rule SUMMARY: This document amends the Cus- toms Regulations by imposing emergency import restrictions on culturally significant archaeolog- ical artifacts from the region of the Niger River Valley of Mali and the Bandiagara Escarpment (Cliff), Mali. These restrictions are being im- posed pursuant to a Determination of the United States Information Agency issued under author- ity of the Convention on Cultural Property Imple- mentation Act in accordance with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Or- ganization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Im- port, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cul- tural Property.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The value of cultural property, whether archae- ological or ethnological in nature, is immea- surable. Such items often constitute the very essence of a society and convey important information concerning a people's origin, his- tory, and traditional setting. The importance and popularity of such items regrettably makes them targets of theft, encourages clandestine looting of archaeological sites, and results in their illegal export and import. The U.S. shares in the international concern for the need to protect endangered cultural property. The appearance in the U.S. of stolen or illegally exported artifacts from other coun- tries where there has been pillage has, on occa- sion, strained our foreign and cultural relations. This situation, combined with the concerns of museum, archaeological, and scholarly com- munities, was recognized by the President and Congress. It became apparent that it was in the national interest for the U.S. to join with other countries to control illegal trafficking of such arti- cles in international commerce. The U.S. joined international efforts and ac- tively participated in deliberations resulting in the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Ex- port and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Prop- erty [823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)]. U.S. acceptance of the 1970 UNESCO Convention was codified into U.S. law as the "Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act" (Pub. L. 97-446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). The spirit of the Con- vention was enacted into law to promote U.S. leadership in achieving greater international cooperation towards preserving cultural trea- sures that are of importance not only to the nations whence they originate, but also to greater international understanding of mankind's common heritage. The U.S. is, to date, the only major art importing country to implement the 1970 Convention. african arts * autumn 1995 33</page><page sequence="3">It was with these goals in mind that Customs issued interim regulations to carry out the provi- sions of the Act. The interim regulations, which were set forth in ?12.104, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 12.104), were published in the Federal Register as T.D. 85-107 on June 25, 1985 (50 FR 26193). and took effect immediately. After con- sideration of comments received on the interim regulations, final regulations were issued as T.D. 86-52, published in the Federal Register on February 27. 1986 (51 FR 6905), and took effect effect on March 31, 1986. Those regulations were again amended on January 19, 1990 (55 FR 1809), by T.D. 90-3 which provided members of the public a listing of all T.D.s which had been issued imposing import restrictions under the Act. Both the country where the article origi- nates and a highlight of the type of article cov- ered appear next to the T.D. number. This document amends the regulations again by adding additional cultural property to the list of articles for which import restrictions exist. Mali Under sections 303(a)(3) of the Cultural Property Implementation Act [19 U.S.C. 2602 (a)(3)]. the Government of Mali, a State Party to the 1970 UNESCO Convention, asked the U.S. Govern- ment to impose emergency import restrictions on certain archaeological materials from the region of the Niger River Valley in Mali and the Bandiagara Escarpment (Cliff) in Mali. Notice of receipt of this request was pub- lished by the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) in the Federal Register on September 21. 1992. On September 14, 1992. the request had been referred to the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, which conducted a review and in- vestigation, and submitted its report in accor- dance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 2605(f) to the Deputy Director, USIA, in December 1992. The Committee found the situation in Mali to be an emergency, in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 2603(a)(2) and (3). and recommended that emergency import restric- tions be imposed on archaeological material from the above mentioned regions in Mali. The Deputy Director, pursuant to the authority vest- ed in him under Executive Order 12555 and USIA Delegation Order 86-3, considered the Committees recommendations and made the determination that emergency import restric- tions be applied. (See USIA notice elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.) The Commissioner of Customs, in consulta- tion with the Deputy Director of the USIA, has drawn up a list of types of covered archaeo- logical material from the region of the Niger River Valley and the Bandiagara Escarpment in Mali. The materials on the list are subject to ? 12.104a(b), Customs Regulations. As provid- ed in 19 U.S.C. 2601 etseq., and ?12.104a(b). Customs Regulations, listed material from this area may not be imported into the U.S. unless accompanied by documentation certifying that the material left Mali legally and not in violation of the laws of Mali. In the event an importer cannot produce the certificate, documentation, or evidence required by ?12.104c. Customs Regulations, at the time of making entry, ?12.104d provides that the district director shall take custody of the mate- rial until the certificate, documentation. or evi- dence is presented. Section 12.104e provides that if the importer states in writing that he will not attempt to secure the required certificate. import controls from Canada, El Salvador, Bolivia, Peru, Guatemala, and Mali. Mali has the distinction of being the first African country, and the first country outside the Western Hemisphere, to submit a cultural property request under the Convention. All of these requests have been reviewed by the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, whose eleven members include archaeologists, anthropologists, and eth- nologists; experts in the international sale of art; and representatives of museums and the general public. The Committee's recommendations on these requests have been submitted to the Director of USIA, who, in turn, has rendered decisions consistent with these recommendations. Most of these requests have been treated under the emergency provision of the Cultural Property Implementation Act, which enables our response to clearly circum- scribed situations of pillage. El Salvador, for example, needed protection of pre- Hispanic material originating in a well-defined archaeological zone where an estimated 5,000 looters pits had already been dug, posing a serious threat to any sci- entific archaeology. Earlier this year El Salvador submitted a new request for U.S. pro- tection of all its pre-Hispanic archaeological heritage. After reviewing the Cultural Property Advisory Committee's recommendation, USIA made an independent deci- sion which resulted in the first bilateral cultural property agreement within the UNESCO Convention framework. Like actions taken under the emergency provision, such an agreement is effective for five years; however, unlike the former, which may be extended for only three years, a cultural property agreement may be renewed indef- initely in five-year increments, and only upon a review by the Cultural Property Advisory Committee. Bolivia needed U.S. import protection of antique textiles whose unique stylistic characteristics made them a desirable commodity on the art market. They belong to Coroma, a small Andean community visited by art dealers and middlemen who, it is alleged, arranged for the systematic removal of the textiles from their ceremonial bun- dles. Subsequently, they began to appear on the U.S. commercial market, and some were mounted in a popular traveling exhibition that likely enhanced their value as commodities. For Coromans, however, they are not commodities but items integral to their political, social, and religious practices. Handed down through generations, the textiles are the single most vital link between their past, present, and future. Peru sought protection of Moche material-mostly gold, silver, and copper ob- jects-newly discovered on its northern coast at Sipin. It is claimed that this site has yielded the richest intact tomb yet found in the Western Hemisphere. The site had already been partially looted before armed guards were brought in to protect it, and some of the looted material had quickly made its way to California, to England, and supposedly to Europe as well. Guatemala, too, petitioned the U.S. for an emergency import ban on all Maya arti- facts originating in the Peten region. Guatemala's petition explained how "this mag- nificent cultural legacy, in which all Guatemalans take pride, and which foreigners admire, has been greatly damaged and diminished by pillage and theft." All of the material described above is prohibited from entry into the U.S. unless accom- panied by an export certificate issued by the country of origin. Even if the restricted mate- rial passes the port of entry without inspection, it may be seized subsequently by the Customs Service if a violation of the import restrictions is found to have occurred. With our first action on the African continent, effective in September 1993, Mali now has the benefit of emergency U.S. import restrictions on archaeological material origi- 34 african arts * autumn 1995</page><page sequence="4">nating in the region of the Niger River Valley. This action followed a determination that the level of pillage from archaeological sites in this region is of crisis proportions and that Mali's cultural heritage is in jeopardy. The action includes protection of Bandiagara and sites at Djenn6, Guimbala, and Bougouni. While such protection may not achieve a dramatic end to pillage and illicit trade, it will bring us measurably closer to long-term protection of the world's in situ heritage. Already the U.S. action with respect to Sipin has stabilized the situation. Systematic archaeology is taking place there, uncovering more tombs and adding to our knowl- edge of the Moche culture; modern museum exhibition space is being created for the excavated objects; access to the material by the general public has been made possible by an international traveling exhibition; and the resident archaeologist has provided the local population-including the original looters-the opportunity to develop an appreciation for the ancestral importance of the site. In addition, Peru's National Congress passed special legislation declaring the conservation, protection, and pro- motion of the archaeological patrimony of Sipin to be of national importance. In El Salvador, the imposition of U.S. import restrictions has stimulated authorities to strengthen their cultural patrimony legislation, which now mandates a national inventory of cultural resources. USIA has supported this undertaking by sponsoring, with the cooperation of the Getty Art History Information Program, an expert assess- ment of what El Salvador needs to accomplish this daunting task. Guatemala has undertaken preventive conservation training workshops, some under the auspices of USIA's Fulbright exchange program. It is completely overhaul- ing its ministry of culture to develop an infrastructure more suitable for protecting its fragile cultural heritage, and is planning to create regional museums as repositories for the excavated archaeological record. In Bolivia, the people of Coroma have been motivated to inventory their textiles and look to ways of preserving them in a museum-like setting while allowing access for ceremonial purposes. And Mali reports that it has initiated a policy of photo documentation as part of its export authorization program. It promulgated a national decree that brings the activi- ties of antiquarians under control. Public education initiatives have begun by the Musee National, and Malian archaeologists are experimenting with cultural missions to Djenne, Timbuktu, and Bandiagara to teach the local population how to manage their own cultural heritage. Bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and several countries in the Western Hemisphere has stimulated interest in regional collaboration in Mesoamerica, recog- nizing the fact that cultural heritage does not necessarily respect modern political boundaries. At the 1994 Summit of the Americas, the protection of cultural heritage was adopted as a major action item: "work with hemispheric governments to enhance appreciation of indigenous cultures and cultural artifacts through the implementation of cultural property protection agreements." The African Region Of the eighty-one countries that have become State Parties to the 1970 UNESCO Convention, nineteen are on the African continent: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cete d'Ivoire, Egypt, Guinea, Libya, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Tanzania, Zaire, Zambia. documentation, or evidence, or the importer does not present the required certificate, doc- umentation, or evidence to Customs within the time provided, the material shall be seized and summarily forfeited to the U.S. in accordance with the provisions of part 162, Customs Reg- ulations (19 CFR Part 162). List of Archaeological Artifacts From the Niger River Valley Region, Mali, and the Bandiagara Escarpment (Cliff), Mali Archaeological material made prior to 1742 from the Region of the Niger River Valley, Mali, and the Bandiagara Escarpment (Cliff), Mali, includes, but is not limited to, the categories listed below.

Flutes, with end blown, bi-toned. 2. Harps. 3. Drums. The extent to which the cultural resources are being exploited to satisfy market demands outside the continent is well known. In view of this, it is stunning that so few countries in West Africa are represented on this list and that only one, Mali, has submitted an official request to the United States Government for protection of its cultural patrimony. Perhaps others will choose the course of Mali. For example, Ghana, which is not a signatory to the Convention, would find it advantageous to ratify it, thus becoming eli- gible to request U.S. import controls on the gold regalia of the Akan peoples. Like the Coroma textiles, these regalia, used for ceremonial purposes and passed on to future generations, are held in common trust, but observers report that these pieces are nev- ertheless finding their way to the international art market. In his article "Lost Heritage: The Destruction of African Art," which appeared in the September 1990 issue of ARTnews, Andrew Decker writes about the extent of cultural depredation suffered by some African nations. According to Decker, "The magnitude of the destruction is immense" and is due to the catastrophic effects of the environ- ment, the general lack of basic conservation skills and equipment, and an ineffectual law enforcement apparatus-all problems that are by no means unique to the African continent. A further complicating factor is an inherent African view that places the functional importance of such objects above other considerations. Reconciling this view with the need for effective national cultural policies and museums specific to the needs of Africans is no small task for the few but dedicated professionals within the African cultural community. Ameliorative Trends There are promising signs. One of them involves ICCROM, the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of Cultural Property, based in Rome. ICCROM has launched a long-term training program for African museum personnel in which basic principles of preventive conservation are taught and enriched with on-site training seminars in Africa. The ongoing West African Muse- ums Project based in Dakar continues to offer grants and professional assistance to museums in West Africa. And ICOM is leading the way for a systematic program of inventory in Africa. In addition, many anthropologists and archaeologists are searching for ways to support African colleagues and cultural officials who are making steady gains in implementing the policies that will sustain institutions that are necessary to protect and manage what remains of Africa's cultural resources. A few years ago, members of the Society of Africanist Archaeologists adopted a resolution condemning the illicit market in African antiquities and pledging the Society's efforts to undermine this trade through ethical practices and by searching for reasonable alternatives to the trade. ICOM adopted a Code of Professional Ethics in 1987, urging museums to "recog- nize the relationship between the marketplace and the initial and often destructive taking of an object for the commercial market, and recognize that it is highly unethi- cal for a museum to support in any way, whether directly or indirectly, that illicit mar- ket." Numerous American museums have adopted stricter acquisitions policies in harmony with the spirit of the 1970 UNESCO Convention and the U.S. enabling leg- islation. And, in recent years, curator and conservator groups in the U.S. have taken 36 african arts * autumn 1995</page><page sequence="6">steps to modify their own codes of ethics to offer guiding principles in handling objects without provenience, objects that may have been acquired outside prevailing legal and ethical parameters. Yet another interesting development is an apparent evolution in the paradigm of basic museum functions. Perhaps it is no accident that in an atmosphere of growing sensitivity to cultural property issues and to the relationship of museums to those issues, the function "to collect" (the pillar of a museum's raison d'etre) is being sub- sumed by the function "to preserve." This emphasis on preservation strengthens the museum's role as steward of humankind's artistic and cultural heritage and encour- ages more prudent collecting practices consistent with international standards and regulations affecting the movement of cultural property. All this may suggest a developing dynamic that could stimulate the pursuit of new avenues of access to protected material, as the Cultural Property Implemen- tation Act challenges us to do. It is explicit in providing "that the application of import restrictions...is consistent with the general interest of the international com- munity in the interchange of cultural property among nations for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes." Increasingly, we realize that laws are not the ultimate answer to the problem of pillage and illicit trade. Rather, they are an essential stimulus for change in the way we per- ceive the importance of our cultural resources and how we care for them. While the local populace may frequently be the first to plunder in order to satisfy basic needs, often those in authority have been willing participants in the illicit trade that perpetu- ates the steady loss of national patrimony. While we attempt to educate local citizens to cherish the national heritage, those of us in positions of greater responsibility and trust should not exempt ourselves from the legal and moral responsibility to protect that heritage. Laws can also nurture an environment for cooperative initiatives leading to other ways of protecting our nonrenewable, irreplaceable cultural heritage. Toward that end, USIA, with the support of private organizations such as the Getty Conser- vation Institute and the U.S. National Committee for the International Council on Monuments and Sites (US/ICOMOS), has sponsored two regional symposiums-- one for Asia in 1991 and the other for the Middle East and North Africa in 1993. Their focus was on policy development and implementation with respect to the pro- tection of cultural heritage. The symposiums examined how land use, tourist devel- opment, economic development, the environment, and other factors such as looting combine to threaten both the movable and immovable cultural heritage; and how the relevant ministries can coordinate their policies in ways that maximize the pro- tection of the cultural heritage. These and related program opportunities, combined with the statutory responsibili- ties of USIA under the Cultural Property Implementation Act, give the Agency a piv- otal role in international legal efforts to curb illicit trade, and define the Agency as an important catalyst in advancing worldwide efforts to mitigate the irreplaceable loss of humankind's cultural heritage. Together, signatories to the 1970 UNESCO Convention must actively encourage the participation of other art-importing nations in these efforts. This is essential, otherwise our looted heritage will simply continue its flow along the paths of least resistance. E Inapplicability of Delayed Effective Date and Public Notice Procedures While this amendment is being made without notice or public procedure, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), because the action being taken is of an emergency nature and such notice or public procedure would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest, it should be noted that the USIA did provide public notice in the Federal Register that it had received a request from the Malian Government that these restrictions be imposed. Because of the emergency nature of the action, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), a delayed effective date is not required. Executive Order 12291 Because this document concerns a foreign af- fairs function of the United States, it is not subject to E.O. 12291 therefore, a regulatory impact analy- sis is not required. Regulatory Flexibility Act Because a notice of proposed rulemaking is not required to promulgate this regulation, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do not apply.
