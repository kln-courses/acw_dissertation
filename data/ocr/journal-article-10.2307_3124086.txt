<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SYMPOSIUM ON FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER was with the issue of the public lands. His inquiries were preliminary, almost fragmentary, broad brush summaries with sweeping generali- zations that fitted his overall themes of frontier and section. Two years after Turner's death in 1932, Paul Wallace Gates pub- lished his first book, a study of the Illinois Central Railroad's coloni- zation efforts. Its appearance signaled a new level of interest and analysis in the examination of the public domain.29 Gates would go on to analyze the varying influences of the public lands on our na- tional life over two centuries and across most of the continent, doing work over fifty years that Turner never eagerly pursued. Were he alive, Turner surely would have read Gates and approved, but his attention would have been only brief, for he would already be think- ing about something new. The Dark and Bloody but Endlessly Inventive Middle Ground of Indian Frontier Historiography Mary E. Young Frederick Jackson Turner, a native of Portage, Wisconsin, wrote his Johns Hopkins dissertation on a subject close to home: "The Charac- ter and Influence of the Indian Trade in Wisconsin."' His adviser, Herbert Baxter Adams, a Eurocentric white male if there ever was one, doubted the importance of so lowly a topic, so Turner naturally freighted his subject with all the significance it could carry, especially evolutionary significance. As a general rule, Turner explained, a trading post "[e]stablished in the midst of an undeveloped society by 29 Paul Wallace Gates, The Illinois Central Railroad and Its Colonization Work (Cambridge, Mass. 1934).

Not all trading frontiers were identical; the gulf between Roman and barbarian (or Phoenician and Greek) was smaller than that between European and Indian, partly on account of "race differences." Still, Turner argued, both the "destructive" and the "elevating influences" of such trade should be worthy of histori- cal exploration.3 So far as Indian society was concerned, destructive influences pre- dominate in Turner's analysis. Tribesmen welcomed the trader, whom they saw as a "quasi-supernatural" bringer of useful and at- tractive novelties, but they rapidly became dependent on the trade because of the overwhelming military advantage conferred by fire- arms. "The stage of civilization that could make a gun and gun-pow- der was too far above the bow and arrow stage to be reached by the Indians."4 No longer a subsistence hunter, the Indian became "a hunter for furs with which to procure the goods of civilization." This "tended to perpetuate the hunter stage," while simultaneously (Turner nonetheless notes) developing a mercantile class of interme- diary traders among the native people.5 Such commerce was not wholly alien to the Indians; in fact preexisting intertribal trade, "commerce in the popular sense of the term," had formed the origi- nal basis on which trade between Indians and Europeans developed. Europeans even adopted the Indians' "fictive" definition of trade as "an exchange of presents." Intermarriage gave French traders an ad- vantage, but Turner noticed as a result, "the purity of the stock was destroyed and a mixed race produced."6 Appointing chiefs without regard to native social organization, the traders broke down the old totemic divisions and left the tribe "without a recognized head." As the "extinction" of game made lands less valuable, tribesmen ex- changed lands for annuities. Traders collected annuities rather than furs in payment of debts, which led to a decline in the Indian's "busi- ness honesty" and an increase in his consumption of whiskey.7 The 2 Ibid., 82. 3Ibid., 90. 4 Ibid., 167. 5Ibid., 166. 6 Ibid., 167. 7Ibid. 194</page><page sequence="3">A SYMPOSIUM ON FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER careful reader is at a loss to discover any "elevating" influences in this process of disintegration. On the Euro-American side, however, elevating influences prolif- erated, and these influences constitute the major focus of Turner's analysis. Together with the leading philanthropic imperialists of his generation, Turner found the Indian past significant principally as a path (rather literally) to the Anglo-American future. Since Indians supplied food to the early settlements, they assisted both the English and the French in gaining a foothold in America. The trade invited European exploration and the opening up of interior water systems. Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to find opportunities for private trad- ers displaced by the government's factory systems and John Jacob Astor established a brief "foothold" for American claims to Oregon with his post at Astoria. Pathfinder John C. Fremont and the earliest emigrants to California followed trader publicists and guides. Trading posts provided strategic points of rivalry in the conflicts for empire between France and Britain. In either case, fur traders briefly re- tarded the "agricultural stage" for both Indians and prospective set- tlers; but in the end the trader became the "farmer's pathfinder.'"8 Trading posts were pioneers of settlement, Turner grandly con- cluded; the Wisconsin lead trade and every major city in the state owed its origin to traders' activities, while Indian trails established the routes of future highways. Two years after the publication of his dissertation, Turner pub- lished his better-known essay on the "Significance of the Frontier." Always a thrifty historian, he recycled many of the themes of his dis- sertation, but in the essay the evolutionary theme prevailed more in- sistently. Standing at the Cumberland Gap, and a century later at South Pass, the historian witnessed the inevitable procession: buffalo, Indian, fur trader and hunter, cattle-raiser, pioneer farmer. The In- dian trade, Turner argued, had paved the way for civilization not just in Milwaukee and Green Bay, but also in Albany, Pittsburgh, Chi- cago, Detroit, and Kansas City. The Indian frontier served national history as a consolidating agent, fostering intercolonial cooperation and united national action, and providing a military training school for a nascent empire. Authors of the 1990s, drawing on the work of a generation of eth- nohistorians, informed by the disciplines of demography, archae- ology, ecology, anthropology, and the "new" social history, and by 8 Ibid., 174. 195</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF THE EARLY REPUBLIC the intellectual exchanges facilitated at the D'Arcy McNickle Center for Indian History at the Newberry Library, tend to reverse Turner's priorities. Their political agenda is less imperial than multicultural. They privilege the native experience, explore the complexities of in- tercultural exchange, often emphasize the egalitarian character of re- lations on the "middle ground" between ethnocultural groups of the colonial period, and tend to treat the gradual disappearance of this middle ground as decline rather than progress. But these critical new historians share Turner's commitment to the significance of the In- dian frontier. Richard White in The Middle Ground begins, like Turner, with the gathering of peoples in the region between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi, centered at Green Bay.9 Disease and depopulation, as well as Iroquois guns, bore responsibility for the peoples' movements, and microclimates favorable to corn-growing and fishing dictated population centers. French missions and forts followed the refugees into the region. White traces the social and ceremonial innovations these tribes employed to create a framework for peace, alliance, and exchange: intermarriage, adoption, gifts exchanges, the midewiwin society, the calumet ceremony, and the Eagle Dance. Like Turner, White concludes that the French drew the Great Lakes tribes into the fur trade as a way of winning victories over the Iroquois and Sioux; he also hypothesizes that some natives converted Christ into a Mani- tou. By the 1680s, the tribesmen and women had learned that the French were more greedy than omnipotent, and surely not Manitous. Like Turner, White attributes French influence during the period of alliance with the Algonquians to their services as mediators and peacemakers. Peace with the Iroquois permitted a diaspora from refu- gee centers to still more fertile and temperate lands. Their need to find ways to secure foreigners' cooperation without the use of force drove the French and the native peoples to craft a cultural Middle Ground, justifying their own actions according to their partner's cultural premises (which they sometimes misper- ceived). Christian Indian women, attracted by the powerful figure of Mary, responded to Jesuits' strictures against polygamy by marrying Frenchmen who profited from both the women's services and their powerful social connections. Through a series of pragmatic fictions, the French came to accept a version of the Algonquian way of dealing 9 White, The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815 (New York 1991). 196</page><page sequence="5">A SYMPOSIUM ON FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER with murder. Between French greed and native robbery and murder, the Middle Ground could be dark and bloody, but it held. European goods enabled Algonquian gift-givers to transform enemies into friends, and in time both ceremonial life and diplomacy came to re- quire such imported materials. The French tried, but failed to tie payments to services rendered. Guns apart, perhaps, the natives were not materially dependent on French goods, though they appealed to the French, as to their Manitous, in terms of need truly piteous. "Medal" chiefs, chosen by the people and simply recognized by the French, strengthened their positions as Indian leaders by serving as conduits for European presents. In "republican" Ohio, last settled of the intertribal village clus- ters, rebels against the French rebelled as well against their own vil- lage hierarchies and created a new political order in Logstown and Pickawillany. By 1753, Ohio's Indian republicans, including the Iro- quois, regarded both British and French as a single, Christian threat. Neolin's separatist prophecies became part of a larger movement of religious syncretism as the tribes struck at the stingy British succes- sors of the French peres. Unsuccessful at leading rebellion, Neolin proved eager to use Christian doctrine to supplement his original vi- sion. His teaching reflected a shift-from ritual concern to moral con- cern in native religious thinking.10 Following their defeat, rebel Algonquians allied with the English, but their new Middle Ground centered on diplomacy, not daily life, for British settlers hated, feared, and despised the Indians and did not marry or live among them. British parsimony deprived chiefs of the means of controlling discontented warriors, and the rising liquor trade undermined village peace. The British middle ground proved firmest on the Ohio River and eastern shores of Lake Erie, where traders and captives preserved earlier French traditions of intermar- riage. Elsewhere the peace was unstable. With 50,000 whites of heterogeneous ethnicity living west of the Appalachians by 1774, unruly young men on both sides drank, stole horses, and fought one another. On neither side could authorities control delinquents. The similarities between the mixed agricultural, grazing, and hunting economies of Indians and Europeans produced 10 A recent study of the reconstitution of Shawnee and Delaware communities in Ohio is Michael N.

The French had been friends and relatives; the English were enemies and thieves. Frontier Indian haters in the 1770s and 1780s wiped out many Indian friends of the whites. As the British lost control of their Anglo-Ameri- can settlements, the post-revolutionary struggle between confederated tribes and newly liberated Americans over control of the Ohio coun- try completed the process of defining the Indians as "Other." Indian conciliators such as Hendrick Aupaumut lost their own struggle to promote the Americans as "Washingtons," rather than "Big Knives." Miami leaders recreated the image of the British as fathers who would assist in the fight against the American Other. Nativist leaders Tenskwatawa (the Prophet) and Tecumseh re- sponded to the peculiar American combination of imperial benevo- lence (Jefferson's "civilization" programs) and back-country Indian- hating with a separatism both militant and syncretic. "Paradoxical nativists," they were comprehensible only on the middle ground.11 Rejecting the traditional work of women as cultural intermediaries, Tecumseh and the Prophet sought, American-style, to subordinate the sex. They found their most enthusiastic supporters among west- ern tribes who had not yet witnessed the power and numbers of the encroaching Americans. Their intertribal villages and the league of villages that was their confederation represented a culmination of the politics of the Middle Ground; with Tecumseh's death in 1813, White concludes, the attempt to reconstitute the middle ground finally failed: "Once there had been a complicated world that could be both dreamscape and landscape, that contained both masters of the game and fur traders, prophets and missionaries, villages like Detroit and villages like Tippecanoe. This world, pulled forward by Europeans and Indians in tandem, vanished from most of what had been the pays den haut. The middle ground itself withered and died. The Americans arrived and dictated."'2 1 White, Middle Ground, 502. 12 Ibid., 523.

Richard White has been an able spokesman for the position that the enclavement of Indian communities, the exploitation of Indian re- sources, the encouragement of dependency, and the social, cultural, and political de- velopment of tribal life do not end with the frontier. See White, The Roots of 198</page><page sequence="7">A SYMPOSIUM ON FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER Daniel Usner pursues similar themes in a different regional set- ting and a social milieu complicated by the presence of involuntary immigrants from Africa.13 Usner finds the French at Mobile in 1702 making temporary peace between Choctaws and Chickasaws, exploit- ing other tribal rivalries to obtain Indian slaves, and establishing so- ciable ties with native communities through feasts, calumet-smoking, and gift-giving. Fearing the potential for Indian/African-American al- liances, the French ceased enslaving tribespeople for local use; when in 1729 they crushed a revolt against the Natchez, they shipped cap- tives to the Indies in exchange for imported Africans. Unable to supply goods to both Choctaws and Chickasaws, the French instead maintained a balance of power by fostering intertribal warfare. Colonial ties led the Choctaws to establish more centralized and stratified government, while Franco-British trade competition fostered tribal factions. Closer to French settlement, the petites nations created by depopulation and tribal fragmentation supplied French customers with venison, corn, herbs, baskets, hens, and horses. Fur trading posts in the interior became centers of food exchange among French, Indians, and African Americans who pioneered the creole cuisine. The small size of the French colonial population made it neces- sary to admit African Americans to careers of talent, such as crafts- men, traders, soldiers, herders, hunters, petty cultivators, and boatmen. In 1740, fifty free blacks in New Orleans formed their own militia company. During the French period, the marginality of Louis- iana to the Atlantic economy and the sparse colonial population re- tarded the development of commercial agriculture on slave plantations. Louisiana became Spanish in 1762, and West Florida, after a sea- son under British control, followed suit in 1783. Both the British and the Spanish proved more energetic colonizers than the French, and plantation agriculture and the commercialized deerskin trade ex- Dependency.

Restriction of slave assemblies, concubinage, marketing, and freedom of movement followed suit. With the gradual disappearance of middle-ground society, slaves' former means of sub- sistence-access to isolated terrain, firearms, theft, and petty trad- ing-became forms of resistance and rebellion. As both white and black populations escalated, the middle ground turned underground. Well supplied with rum by resident traders, but less well supplied with presents, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Creeks resorted to social banditry. After 1783, plantation agriculture, racial stratification, and mo- nopolization of the fur trade by Americans undermined the "flexibil- ity and fluidity" of "older systems of livelihood." Still, "economic customs and intercultural relations fostered over the previous century would endure for many Indians, settlers, and slaves as vital strategies of resistance for a long time to come."14 In the large interior Indian nations, among the Choctaws and Chickasaws, the flood of resident traders after 1762 and their marriages to tribal women accelerated the tribes' efforts to adopt the crops, animals, agricultural and commer- cial techniques of their neighbors. By 1800 the sons and grandsons of French and English traders had established themselves as tribal lead- ers. In another part of the South, the Cherokee Piedmont and Appala- chia, Marvin Thomas Hatley has discovered that even the English proved briefly amenable to trade and diplomacy characterized by mu- tual dependency and accommodation. As frontier storekeepers paved the way for agricultural settlement and aspired to become patriarchal planters, they found psychosocial dependency on the Cherokees in- creasingly distasteful. Cherokee egalitarianism threatened hierarchical relations both within the family and between masters and slaves. Cherokee militancy and land retention thwarted white men's expan- sionist ambitions. Hatley focuses on processes of estrangement, exac- erbated by the Cherokee War of 1759-1761, the bitter frontier warfare of the revolutionary period, and the continued guerilla en- gagements with the Chicamaugas, which led both north British mig- rants and Cherokees to separatist visions of their cultures and destinies. Still, until this final removal in the 1830s, many Cherokees tried to craft frameworks for continued, if controlled mutual ex- 14 Ibid., 148. 200</page><page sequence="9">A SYMPOSIUM ON FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER change. Their famous metis-led pursuit of "civilization" was the lat- est of many efforts to cultivate a middle ground.15 Joel Martin identifies the Sequoyan syllabary as a distinctive product of the middle ground among the Cherokees. The principal focus of his work, however, is the violent demise of that ground in the 1813-1814 Muskogee civil war. It was a creative destruction, in which nativist Muskogee forged a rebirth of their religious and social identi- ties at enormous cost both to themselves and to their intrusive white neighbors.16 While similar intercultural trade, diplomacy, and intermarriage occurred on the Spanish colonial frontier of the Southwest, religious identity and organization played a larger role than on frontiers to the east and north. In When Jesus Came, The Corn Mothers Went Away, Ram6n A. Gutierrez begins with the stories-the creation narrative of the Pueblo peoples.17 The stories express the Pueblos' equation of sexuality, fertility, and regeneration with the holy. January and Sep- tember ceremonials celebrating female fecundity featured sexual in- tercourse believed to foster cosmic harmony. When warriors brought scalps in from the wild, women sat on the scalps; thus domesticated, the scalps became potent rainmakers. When celibate Spanish Francis- cans arrived in 1598, they did not respond favorably to Pueblo wom- en's efforts to domesticate them through intercourse, or to the ceremonial fellatio male rain-makers employed. Nor did Juan de On- ate, leader of their expedition, rely upon persuasion. After reenacting the conquest of the Aztecs, he informed the chiefs of thirty-one Pueb- los that they must obey the priests or their cities would be destroyed. Reciprocal gift-giving lay at the heart of Pueblo theology and social practice, but what they gave as gifts the Spanish received as tribute 15 Marvin Thomas Hatley, "The Dividing Paths: The Encounters of the Cher- okees and the South Carolinians in the Southern Mountains, 1670-1785" (Ph.D. diss., Duke University 1989).

When Acoma war- riors responded violently, the Spanish slaughtered eight hundred and condemned the remaining adults to slavery, severing the feet of men over twenty-five years of age. The Spanish could practice deception and accommodation as well as cruelty. They took pains to arrive in the rainy season, and friars represented themselves as supermen who controlled the forces of na- ture.18 Pueblo people, in turn, understood Spanish practices accord- ing to their own cultural norms. They viewed Spanish governors and soldiers as "Outside Chiefs" comparable to their own officials for ex- ternal affairs, and the friars as "Inside Chiefs," comparable to their theocracy in controlling the sacred, conjuring rain, healing the sick, and (through domestic animals) providing meat. As the religious equipment of the Kivas enabled the Pueblos to recreate the time of their emergence from earth and call the Katsina spirits from the mountains, the reredos behind the altars of the Spanish churches brought saints to witness Christ's sacrifice. To obtain the friars' ritual blessing, the Pueblos gave them food, labor, and respect, as they did to their own chiefs. The Pueblos' precontact wars had familiarized them with con- quest and the imposition of alien deities. When circumstances permit- ted, however, medicine men killed and scalped friars and invited women to domesticate the scalps. Padres in turn profaned the Kivas and erected crosses over them. The Spanish deliberately disrupted hunting and gift exchanges between Pueblo elders and younger per- sons and changed the sexual division of labor by inducing men to build and women to weave. They imposed patriarchal authority over both land and children which women had controlled, and suppressed women's fertility societies. For the cyclic ritual calendar they substi- tuted daily routines of work and prayer. They exploited similarities between prayer sticks and the cross, between Pueblo ritual self-flagel- lation and their own. This was "an evangelization strategy of eradi- cating native rites and substituting Christian ones that mimicked indigenous gestures and paraphernalia, no matter how divergent their respective meanings." This strategy worked so well, on the surface, that it "led the friars to misinterpret the apparent piety with which the Indians worshipped God."19 18 Compare the accommodationist tactics of French Jesuits described in James Axtell, The Invasion Within: The Contest of Cultures in Colonial North America (New York 1985), 23-127. 19 Gutierrez, When Jesus Came, 100. 202</page><page sequence="11">A SYMPOSIUM ON FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER During the seventeenth century, the Spanish provoked Apache raids and failed to cure smallpox or prevent drought. The Pueblos resorted to ancient rites and begged the corn mothers to return. Med- icine men stigmatized friars as witches, and 49 of 100 Franciscans who served New Mexico in the seventeenth century achieved the martyrdom many of them coveted. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 drove the Spanish to El Paso; natives shattered bells, icons, and crosses and burned the Spaniards' seeds. After the reconquest of the 1690s, the Franciscans returned, but Pueblo "Outside Chiefs" with Spanish titles, chosen by their own theocracy, took over the role of intermediaries between themselves and the Spanish. The repartimiento, or compulsory labor draft, drew men and women periodically from the villages. Though women ser- vants often had pregnancy forced upon them, Indian villagers shunned them, and their children joined Spanish communities or the gen'zaro towns of detribalized Navajos and Utes who had been cap- tured and enslaved in "just wars" with the Spanish. Genetic mixture drew new boundaries but produced nothing like the French middle ground. Having forged their nation in centuries of holy war against the Moors, the Spanish were not eager to make kinsmen of the "other." For the Spanish, "purity of blood" constituted a claim to honor. Regardless of actual ancestry, everyone who could get away with it claimed "limpieza de sangre." Men who did not hesitate to rape servants put a premium on virginity and marital fidelity among their "own" women. Formal as well as informal intermarriage per- sisted as a practice, far more prevalent among those of mixed ancestry than among Pueblo or Spanish spouses, but as elsewhere in Spanish America "precise" measures of genetic admixture provided almost obsessive markers of social rank. Regardless of the Pueblos' intense concern for boundaries, Span- ish became the lingua franca of native communication, and iron tools, cattle, pigs, chickens, and horses became fixtures in the villages, along with a patrilineal kinship system and male control of land and households.20 To avoid contention and divisions, they made ritual roles and town leadership hereditary. The patrilineal Jesus replaced the matrilineal corn mother. Spanish campaigns against idolatry drove religious rites underground, though even above-ground saints were always depicted in the company of powerful animals. 20 The Zuni, Hopi, Laguna, and Acoma retained the matrilineage. 203</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF THE EARLY REPUBLIC Though Pueblo villages maintained an active trade with Spanish settlements and Pueblo soldiers fought under Spanish command, Bourbon reformers of the latter eighteenth century reduced direct Spanish control of Pueblo communities. They abolished the repartri- miento and deprived the Franciscans of Indian service. By 1792 there were only 16 Franciscan missionaries in New Mexico. The successful Bourbon effort to encourage immigration, agricultural improve- ments, and mercantile acvitity upset the ecological balance between population and arable land, increasing both concentration of land- holding and debt peonage among the Spanish and mestizo popula- tions. Market penetration, powered by United States entrepreneurs during the Mexican period, transformed the economy and society of Euro-Americans, but the Pueblos more successfully maintained their painfully constructed boundaries.21 In contrast to Frederick Jackson Turner, recent ethnohistorians have found on the Indian frontier not so much a point of collision between savagery and civilization as a complex encounter among peo- ples of significantly various ethnic background. On the resulting mid- dle ground, cultural and political conflicts coexisted with mutual efforts to discover and exploit the often intricate parallelisms in politi- cal organization, social control, material culture, and religious belief and practice between native and newcomer societies.22 This rich new literature renders naive Turner's breezy speculations about the na- ture of cultural exchange on the true impact of each culture on the other. And yet, to be fair one must add that today's ethnohistorians, when pressed to justify the significance of their subject in the canon of American history, resort to claims for the impact of Indians on Euro- American civilization at least as far-reaching as those of Turner. Al- though they give their findings a distinctly negative charge, new eth- nohistorians have found (as Turner first insisted) that the frontier was 21 For an examination of cultural change as a function of the "incorporation" of the southwestern area into the metropolitan economy, based on a sociological anal- ysis of the secondary literature, see Thomas D.
