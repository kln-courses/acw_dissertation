<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Museum in Taiwan (p. 21), Chinese National Collection (p. 35), and the Chinese government collection mentioned on p. 24? Even the more cursory reader deserves something better. The Book of Poetry, though essential, is given inflated attention in the poetry section which is rigidly divided into two parts. Confucians read these poems allegorically from didactic angles. Like many modern readers, Wells read them as folk literature. Certainly many of his readings are highly creative, such as taking the first poem as "a sly comment on the unsuccessful attempts of a lord to seduce a peasant girl" (p. 52)! He was surely entitled to his views, but did not do his readers justice by leaving his daring theses unexplained as if they were truisms. The second part, claiming to cover 300 B.C. to 1200 (next 700 years ignored) and capitalizing on half a dozen household names, is at best sketchy. Save the mention of Su Tung-p'o, the account actually stops in the early tenth-century. Citations are again messy and inaccu- rate. In the same space, a thematical, vis-a-vis historical, treatment may warrant better results. The drama section begins with a lengthy treatment of the 14th-century play, The West Chamber, with emphasis on character study. Several other plays are also treated with varying detail. The discussion of one play usually passes on smoothly to that of another through a transition of meaningful comparison. The narrative section discusses two novels and one story collection at length, focusing on fantasy and social refinement as two strains of humor. Prose stories in the Liao-chai collection are misleadingly paraphrased and printed as if they were narrative poems. One vernacular story is also slightly touched upon. All in all, these two sections are much better written than the first two. The art section is marred by jerkiness and superficiality; this book will fare better without it. The real trouble of this book is not so much what it says as what it does not. Sources are confined to book translations in English. In a field with so little rendered into English (much less satisfactorily), this self-imposed limitation, to the extent of excluding translations available in periodicals (only one such translation cited), has devastating effects. One example is the inexcusable omission of the Shih-shuo hsin-yuii, which any informed reader will readily associate with, inter alia, humor in China from the first through the fourth centuries. For those unable to read the original, there are passages translated in journal articles, such as the studies by Professor Richard B. Mather. Many readers are surely disappointed in failing to see the name of Tung-fang Shuo or any example of the voluminous joke literature. To elaborate on works in which humor is but a subordinate quality and ignore those with humor as among the major themes is a result of half-learning. For a writer ethnocentric enough to bypass original sources in the very language concerned and unacquainted even with Western periodical literature, we may be too idealistic to expect him to consult modern Chinese and Japanese studies, indispensable as they are. Very little has been done in Western languages on humor in China, but modern studies on this and other related topics are by no means rare in Chinese and Japanese. Where, in all these pages, are Yang Yin-shen, Chao Ching-shen, Shoji Kakuichi, Shimizu Eikichi, Tanaka Kenji, and Matsueda Shigeo? Alas! Where are the convenient and rather exhaus- tive source anthologies by Wang Ku-lu, Hu Shan-yiian, and Wang Hsiao-i? One can only be so self-restricted at one's own peril. To serve the general readers is no excuse for such a poor and arbitrary modus operandi; they can do without a book based on feeble scholarship. After all, we expect scholarly works from respectable university presses. This work will be more rewarding if Mr. Wells is much better informed and his way of citation more responsible. The one single page for notes is nothing but a perfunctory ritual. This book represents an amateur approach to a potentially rich topic. Y. W. Ma University of Hawaii Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages Review Editor: J. Donald Bowen, University of California, Los Angeles Levenston, E.A. English fbor Israelis, A Guide for Teachers. Jerusalem: Israel Universities Press, 1970. Pp. v + 243. $7.95. The corps of professional English language teachers in Israel is sure to find Professor E. A. Levenston's book, English for Israelis, A Guide For Teachers, a valuable contribution to their field. Moreover, since the ranks of these veterans have swollen in recent years with the influx of large numbers of native speakers of English-many of them Americans-who have taken up language pedagogy with comparatively little preparation, Professor Levenston has supplied a needed boost to teacher training in the country. The level of the book is intended for the teacher who approaches the subject of linguistic analysis with a minimum of background. Nor does Professor Levenston assume that his readers are native speakers of Hebrew. Like himself, they are likely to be bilinguals who are capable of native-speaker insights into both languages. However, the book can still be utilized by teachers whose knowledge of Hebrew is minimal. It is Professor Levenston's stated aim to elucidate the problems, not to solve them. He carries out this objective with a high degree of readability, flavoring the book with many engaging comments which are the result of years of experience as a practicing English language teacher. The problems are set forth under three traditional groupings: phonology, grammar and vocabulary. Phonology and vocab- ulary problems together constitute one-quarter of the book. The remaining three-quarters are taken up with issues of grammar, a division which recognizes a well-accepted appraisal of the problems in second-language teaching. However-and Professor Levenston himself is aware of the dangers-the theoretical base upon which to compare or contrast two languages is certainly more difficult to work with at the grammatical level. Only once in the chapters comparing English and Hebrew grammatical structures does it occur to the author that perhaps the model of grammatical description which he has chosen to work with has imposed limitations of its own. (In the Introduction, he states that he has chosen the "scale and category" grammatical model developed by Halliday, McIn- tosh and Strevens.) Dealing with the problem of verbs + prepositions vs. prepositional phrases in English, he points out that while it is true that both languages have verbs and 306</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS prepositions, in Hebrew prepositions are inflected like nouns. Then, he comments that "to some extent, the difference between the languages ... is simply a feature of the description" (p. 62). It is not clear why Professor Levenston did not consider utilizing a grammatical model which, rather than beginning with a breakdown of the sentence and working up to the whole sentence, instead starts from the sentence level and procedes to an analysis of its components. It would have been interesting and relevant to look at "base to surface" generative analyses of both English and Hebrew in order to find some of the striking similarities and differences between the two languages. Such an approach, along with helping to locate the important "trees" first, might better meet the author's claims for contrastive linguistics. Professor Levenston has put his major thrust into the sections on grammar. Although the sections on vocabulary represent a much smaller part of the whole work, his comments on contrastive semantic ranges between the two languages contribute much worthwhile material. Teachers should benefit from his diagrams in the chapter on Vocabulary which graphically show how two languages categorize experience differently. By the final chapter, the author has amply guided Israeli teachers into being able to realize for themselves why students frequently make the error in English of saying "hello" when they leave their classrooms. The equivilent Hebrew word, shalom, is used for both greeting and leave-taking. Fraida Dubin University of Southern California Thurber, James. The Unicorn in the Garden and Other Fables for Our Time (TC1348) and The Grizzly and the Gadgets and Further Fables for Our Time (TC1412). Read by Peter Usti- nov. New York: Caedmon Records, Inc., 1972. Two discs. $6.98, each. Thurber's fables endow animals with anthropomorphic characteristics in the best Aesopian tradition. They first appeared in the New Yorker magazine in the late 1930's and were published in book form in two volumes by Harper and Row in 1940 and by Simon and Schuster in 1956. They follow the format "title, text, moral" and have no musical bridges or sound effects other than vocal modulations in imitation of the different characters in some of the dia- logues, including regional and ethnic dialects and foreign accents. The fables are humorous in a very sophisticated way. They abound in puns and near puns (the parrot said "I'm the real macaw," an old wolves' tale), twisted aphorisms (all men kill the thing they hate), parodies (yesterday and yesterday and yesterday, creeps in this carapace from day to day to the first syllable of recorded time), mixed proverbs (finders are not their brothers' keepers), paralleled plays on words (the happy-go-lucky and the gloomy-go-sorry), alliterations (moved in the moist and muddy margins, with monstrous mocking metaphors), antitheses (lives of noisy desperation), witticisms (candy is dandy but liquor is quicker), and assorted moralizations (the hell-bent get where they are going, you might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backwards, it is better to have loafed and lost than never to have loafed at all). The two records contain a total of 77 minutes of spoken text divided into 28 segments that range from 1:04 to 4:33 minutes. They are in the rotund and mellifluous voice of Ustinov and are technically excellent. The style is perfor- mance-oriented-careful (the middle syllable of "emerald" is clearly present), formal ("vases" comes out /vaziz/), and typically British ("eat" is pronounced /Et/). These records could possibly be used for teaching English as a second language, but the level of sophistication and the quantity of allusions suggests that an elementary-level application is not recommended. They could be very effective in an advanced class as a comprehension exercise (they would surely command the interest and stretch the ability of students) and as a stimulus for a wide-ranging discussion of American culture in the first half of the twentieth-century.
