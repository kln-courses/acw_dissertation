<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetry and Scepticism in the Wake of the Austrian Enlightenment: Blumauer, Grillparzer, Lenau RITCHIE ROBERTSON St John's College, Oxford I The Austrian Enlightenment did not intend to promote religious scepticism. Its ill-fated leader, Joseph II, convincingly professed himself as loyal to the Church as was his mother Maria Theresia.1 The measures which brought him into conflict with the Church, and induced Pope Pius VI to take the unprecedented step of visiting Vienna in person to remonstrate with him, were economic and political rather than doctrinal. They included the dissolution of the contemplative monastic orders, the attempt to subject ecclesiastical appointments to state control and, most famously, the series of Edicts of Toleration which removed the restrictions on religious worship, occupations and education that had previously affected Lutherans, Calvinists, Greek Orthodox and Jews. But toleration did not mean pluralism. Joseph had no intention of weakening the dominance of the Catholic Church in his Empire. He did, however, seek to weaken the Baroque piety that found expression in elaborate ceremonies, Mariolatry, Corpus Christi processions, pilgrimages and barnstorming sermons, and to promote instead the simple, orderly and rational devotion advocated especially by the Jansenists. Most of the intellectuals who supported Josephinism were broadly sympa thetic to this Reform Catholicism. The Professor of Jurisprudence at Vienna, Johann Valentin Eybel, whose pamphlet Was ist der Pabst? [What is the Pope?] aroused great attention in the year of the Pope's visit, describes himself as 'der vern?nftige und wohl unterwiesene Christ' [the rational and well instructed Christian], equally distant from the enthusiast or 'Schw?rmer', superstitiously awestruck by the Pope, and from the freethinker or 'Freygeist' who subjects the Pope's mitre and saints' legends to shallow mockery.2 The 1 See Maria Theresia und Joseph II.

The freethinking denounced by Eybel ('dieses Unkraut schie?t auch bey uns auf [these weeds flourish here too])3 is also rebuked by Johann Baptist Alxinger in 'Der Freygeist', a poem recommending virtue and religion as antidotes to scepticism. The poetry of Alxinger and his fellows alternates between quiet cheerfulness ('Heiterkeit') and quiet melancholy, accepting the world in either mood as providentially ordered for the best.4 It becomes forceful, however, in the polemical anti clericalism that was an essential part of Josephinism. Alxinger's religion is Josephinist in its praise of toleration and its hostility towards the papacy's pretensions to political and intellectual authority, as well as to monasticism; the latter institution is said to withdraw able-bodied men and women from work and motherhood, encouraging pederasty and reserving unfortunate young women 'f?rs Serail von Gottes Sohn' [for the seraglio of God's son].5 In 'Der Priester Gottes' [God's Priest], Alxinger warns that, though priests no longer burn heretics or instigate wars, they still exercise covert influence and denounce the truth from the pulpit ? but that is because they know their days are numbered: Recht so! denn hat bey einer Nation Aufkl?rung ihre Fakel aufgesteckt, Da st?rzt sein G?tzentempel krachend ein.6 [Quite right! for once Enlightenment has lit her torch in any nation, its idolatrous temple will come crashing down.] There is much more violent polemic, and little serenity, in the work of Aloys Blumauer, a leading Josephinist poet. Educated by Jesuits, and briefly a member of the Society of Jesus before its suspension in 1773, in the early 1780s he became a Mason and was employed as official censor. He was also a journalist, who edited the Wienerischer Musenalmanach together with Johann Franz Ratschky from 1781 to 1792, and single-handed in 1793-94; from 1782 to 1784 he also edited the Wiener Realzeitung, a major organ of liberalism; and from 1784 to 1787 he edited the Journal fiir Freymaurer issued by the lodge 'Zur wahren Eintracht' [True Harmony], to which he was secretary. Blumauer was long famous for his mock epic, Virgils Aeneis travestir^ which appeared in instalments from 1782 to 1788. This ferocious, sometimes scatological satire seeks to support Joseph's stand against the Church by ridiculing Aeneas, the founder of Rome who, in Blumauer's version, is supposed thereby to have founded the papacy. Aeneas not only descends to Hell, finding it full of 3 Ibid., p. 5. 4 See Herbert Zeman, 'Die ?sterreichische Lyrik des ausgehenden 18. und des fr?hen 19.

Such satirical aggression had its counterpart in the depression with which Blumauer was often afflicted. In one of his verse epistles to Johann Pezzi he calls himself a 'Gr?mler' and 'Gr?bler', a melancholy brooder (B 11, 165, 169).7 Blumauer's life was summed up in an alphabetical obituary: Aloys Blumauer Censor, Dichter Epikur?er, Freigeist, Genie, Hagestolz, Jesuit Kenner Latiums Maurer Naso ?sterreichs Pfaffenfeind Qu?lte Rom Sp?ttelte Travestirte Unsterblich Virgils Werk Xenophthalmisch, Ybischartig Zollte der Natur den Tribut.

The poem -Tahiti', dedicated to the explorer Georg Forster, questions whether the Tahitians are as happy as Enlightenment primitivists claimed, suggesting that they too suffer from irrational restrictions such as political oppression, subjection to fashion, superstition and government by priests. He addresses his doubts to the Tahitian people: Hat deine Seele keine Abentheuer Des tollen Aberglaubens ausgeheckt? Hast du nicht Pfaffen, deren Hand den Schleier Der heil'gen L?ge dir um's Auge legt? (B 11, 133) [Has your soul contrived no adventures of mad superstition? Have you no priests whose hand covers your eyes with the veil of pious mendacity?] More personal reasons for his gloomy temperament are suggested by the poems 'An den Magen' [To the Stomach] and 'Ode an den Leibstuhl' 7 The edition quoted is Aloys Blumauer's gesammelte Schriflen, 3 parts (Stuttgart, 1839), cited as with part and page number.

But his main philosophical poem is the long 'Glaubensbekenntni? eines nach Wahrheit Ringenden' [Confession of Faith by a Seeker after Truth]. It has attracted remarkably little attention from modern readers. One of the few who even mention it complains that it is too 'poorly conceived and executed' to count as poetry, and merely 'perpetuate [s] the abstract and barren "Gedankenlyrik" of his rationalistic century'.9 We shall soon find that there is at least a little more to the poem than that. Blumauer's 'Glaubensbekenntni?' is built on antitheses. The main anti thesis is between the intellect ('Verstand'), which enables man to think cor rectly, and the heart, which impels him to action on the basis of belief. The two are at odds because the heart desires so much and yet the intellect can know so little. Accordingly, the greater part of the poem consists of antitheti cal quatrains in which the first two lines formulate a belief and the latter two express knowledge that runs counter to it: Ich glaube, da? du uns in allen Zeiten Durch Wunder kund getan, wie stark du bist: Allein ich seh's, da? dieser Bau der weiten Und sch?nen Welt dein gr??tes Wunder ist. ( , 10) [I believe that in all ages Thou hast shown us by miracles how strong Thou art; yet I see that Thy greatest miracle is the construction of this vast and beautiful world.] As this example shows, Blumauer is not even-handed in thus juxtaposing faith and knowledge. This stanza actually contrasts revelation with natural religion, implying that the latter is self-evident. Similarly, the poem through out sets the official doctrine of the Church against a series of sceptical doubts. Blumauer professes to believe obediently that faith sustains man's feeble intellect; that Europeans are closer to God than the rest of humanity; that certain ceremonies are more pleasing to God than others; that God has given us the Bible for our guidance; that His nature is mysterious; that humanity is sinful and needed to be redeemed by Christ; and so forth. But these propositions are undermined by two methods. One method is by opposing to them the doctrines of natural religion: that man's intellect is there to save him from sole reliance on faith; that Europeans can claim no merit from the accident of their birth; that pious Brahmins are as pleasing to God as pious Christians; that the book of Nature reveals God's purposes as well as the Bible; that an individual's sins are too trivial to annoy God; and so forth. The other, less obvious method consists in subverting official doctrine by a dryly ironic formulation that makes it appear unfamiliar. The claim that Europeans have superior access to religious truth is exposed as absurd by Blumauer's wording: 9 Barbara Becker-Cantarino, Aloys Blumauer and the Literature of Austr?an Enlightenment (Bern and Frankfurt a. M., 1973), p. 85.</page><page sequence="5">RITCHIE ROBERTSON 21 Ich glaube, da? der Mensch in einer Zone Dem Licht sich mehr als in der andern naht, Allein ich wei?, er hat kein Recht zum Lohne, Weil Rom, nicht Japan, ihn erzeuget hat. (B n, 9) [I believe that humanity in one zone approaches the light more closely than in another, yet I know that he deserves no reward for having been engendered in Rome instead of Japan.] The doctrine to which Blumauer feigns assent is here expressed with a bald literalness that calls it into question. This technique of defamiliarization has a long history which has recendy been surveyed by Carlo Ginzburg.10 The criticism of institutions by describing them in bare, alienating language can be found in La Bruy?re's famous description of French peasants as unfamil iar animals, and it was especially used in the Enlightenment in order to criticize European institutions by adopting the perplexed outlook of a visitor from overseas, whether from Persia (Montesquieu's ^tres persanes) or North America (Voltaire's L'Ing?nu). Hence the dryness to which exception has been taken turns out to be an essential part of Blumauer's rhetorical purpose. Blumauer's implicit standpoint is an enlightened theism which attaches more value to revelation through Nature than through scripture. Its main target is the authority arrogated by the Church. In addressing God, Blumauer asserts that God alone, and not the merely human Pope ('der Mensch in Rom', , 7), is able to judge him. The irony at the expense of official doctrine is sustained throughout the poem and reinforced in the final quatrain: Und hast du denn von dieser meiner Bitte Dein g?tig Ohr auf immer weggewandt, So nimm ? ich fleh's, o Herr! zu deiner G?te ? Nimm mir den Glauben oder den Verstand. (B 11, 14) [And if Thou hast forever turned Thy kindly ear away from this my plea, then take ? Lord, I beseech this of Thy kindness ? take my faith or my intellect from me.] The conclusion is clear: intellect without faith is perfectly viable; faith without intellect amounts to insanity. II There are close links between Blumauer and Franz Grillparzer. Not only was Grillparzer, as he tells us in his autobiography, brought up in the Josephinist 10 See 'Making it strange: the prehistory of a literary device', in Carlo Ginzburg, Wooden Eyes. Nine Reflections on Distance, trans, by Martin Ryle and Kate Soper (London and New York, 2002), pp. 1-23.</page><page sequence="6">22 Poetry and Scepticism: Blumauer, Grillparzer, ^au spirit by his father, who had a low opinion of devotional practices; indeed Grillparzer senior had written a dissertation on canon law which the Church had placed on the Index of Prohibited Books. Grillparzer also shared Blumauer's morose temperament and solitary lifestyle. He read Blumauer's satires as a boy, paying tribute to Blumauer's Aeneis in his poem 'Mein Traum' [My Dream, c. 1806], and, in an essay on the nature of parody (1808), maintaining: 'dieses Mannes Werk ist vielleicht das Beste was je in dem Gebiete der Parodie emporgebl?ht ist' [this man's work may well be the best thing that has ever flowered in the realm of parody].11 Among Grillparzer's poems, a large body of work that has been surpris ingly litde studied, the major works tend to be reflective and melancholy.12 Often the melancholy can be explained from his personal life, as with the 'Tristia ex Ponto' cycle (1833), which explores feelings of sadness and bitter ness with fortitude and without false heroics. Some poems, however, work on a more abstract level. For example, 'Abschied von Gastein' [Taking leave of Gastein, 1818] dwells on the sufferings of the poet, comparing them to a suc cession of natural phenomena. The poet's work resembles the blaze from a tree that has been struck by lightning; the pearl produced by the sick oyster; and the glittering of the waterfall which (as Grillparzer too anthropomorphi cally supposes) feels constant pain as its water is dashed on the rocks. All these events occur in an indifferent universe to which the poet addresses his futile laments: Was ihr f?r Lieder haltet; es sind Klagen, Gesprochen in ein freudeloses All. (G 1, 98) [What you take for songs are really laments, spoken into a joyless universe.] Alongside the image of the poet as martyr, familiar from Goethe's Torquato Tasso and from Grillparzer's own Sappho, we have a picture of the universe, no longer guided even by an inscrutable providence, but condemned to blind suffering. As Grillparzer wrote the poem, Schopenhauer was at work on the first part of Die Welt ab Wille und Vorstellung [The World as Will and Ided\, which elaborates a broadly similar picture of life as doomed to perpetual suffering by its subjection to the blind force of the Will. Although such poems go far beyond Blumauer's emotional range, Grillparzer returns to anti-clerical themes reminiscent of Blumauer in 'Campo vaccino', a poem first drafted during his visit to Rome at Easter 1819. The campo vaccino or field for catde is the ruins of the Roman Forum, which Grillparzer, as his diary indicates, explored systematically. Rome made a mixed impression on him. Approaching it along the Via Flaminia, 11 Franz Grillparzer, S?mtliche Werke, ed. by Peter Frank and Karl P?rnbacher, 4 vols (Munich, 1960-65), , 12-18; , 298.

Unfruchtbare, d?rre Heiden, ohne Kultur, ohne Wohnungen, ohne Menschen sagen vernehmlich: hier ist ein Wahlreich, und der Gew?hlte ist ein Priester und dieser Priester ist gew?hnlich ein Greis. (G rv, 299) [As soon as you leave Viterbo the priestly city announces its proximity in a dismal manner. Barren, infertile heaths, without cultivation, without dwellings, without people, say audibly: here is an electoral realm, and the elected one is a priest, and this priest is usually an old man.] He noticed gallows along the road with the dried corpses of murderers and thieves hanging from them. The road itself, the Via Flaminia, reminded him 'wie reich und gl?cklich einst Gegenden waren, wo man derlei Stra?en bauen konnte' [how rich and happy regions once were, where such highways could be built] (ibid.), and he imagined Roman armies marching along the highway. Examining the Forum, however, he was struck by how small its buildings must originally have been, and by the higgledy-piggledy way in which they seemed to be arranged. Christian Rome could offer more mag nificence. Although the exterior of St Peter's disappointed him, because it is impossible to get a clear view of the fa?ade, the interior made up for it. He saw Pope Pius VII blessing the city and the world from the balcony of St Peter's, and wrote: 'er allein, ein Gott, thronend hoch ?ber allen ? ich werde den Augenblick nie vergessen' [he alone, a god, enthroned high above everyone ? I shall never forget that moment] (G iv, 293). This passage should remind us that, despite his Josephinist upbringing, Gr?lparzer did not entirely lose his attachment to Catholicism, though it was an emotional tie which accompanied an abstention from devotional practice and a consis tendy critical attitude towards the institutional Church.13 The only ancient counterpart to St Peter's was the Colosseum, on which some restoration work had recendy been done on the Pope's orders: Ein lebhaftes Bild der r?mischen Gr??e, so, da? die Phantasie dadurch wirklich erweitert wird, gibt unter allen hiesigen Denkm?ler [n] alter Zeit, beinahe allein das Kolosseum. Dieses wird besonders in Rom klar, wo man so viele vorz?gliche Geb?ude sieht und doch verschwinden alle in nichts vor diesem Kolo?. (G iv, 296) [Of all the monuments of antiquity here, the Colosseum is almost the only one that conveys a vivid image of Roman greatness, so that the imagination is truly enlarged by it. This is especially clear in Rome, where so many admirable buildings can be seen, yet all disappear into nothing beside this colossus.] These experiences are recorded in 'Campo vaccino' (G , 114-18), of which part was actually written in the Colosseum.14 It belongs to an already 13 See Eda Sagarra, 'Grillparzer the Catholic?', Modern Language Review, 97 (2002), 108-22. 14 The fullest study of this poem remains August Sauer, 'Proben eines Commentars zu Grillparzer's Gedichten', Jahrbuch der Grillparzer-Geselbchafi, 7 (1897), 1-170.</page><page sequence="8">24 Poetry and Scepticism: Blumauer, Grillparzer, L?nau familiar genre of poetic tourism which included Wilhelm von Humboldt's great elegy 'Rom5, and whose best-known exemplar was Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. In his autobiography, Grillparzer is modest about the poem's claim to originality. It surveys the monuments in turn, commenting on the disparity between classical and Christian Rome. There are two major or structural antitheses: between the Emperors Titus (ad 39-81) and Constantine (ad 272-337), and between the Colosseum and the Cross. The Arch of Titus, built to commemorate his pacification of the eastern provinces after the conquest of Jerusalem, is contrasted with the claims of Constantine, the first Christian Emperor, to bring peace to the Empire. There is a Josephinian subtext here, for Joseph's admirers were fond of calling him a second Titus.15 Although the Arch of Titus may be close to collapse, Titus does not need a physical building to ensure that he is remembered. His frag ile monument is contrasted with the 'Siegesdom', the cathedral of victory, attained by Constantine; the image may suggest St Peter's, but, since that was built twelve centuries after Constantine's conversion, it implies more generally the whole edifice of the Catholic Church, and in particular the papal throne: ?ber Romas Heldentr?mmern Hobst du deiner Kirche Thron, In der Kirche magst du schimmern, Die Geschichte spricht dir Hohn. (11. 85-88) [Over Rome's heroic ruins you raised your Church's throne; you may shine in the Church, but history derides you.] The other antithesis, between the Colosseum and the Cross, continues, yet more extravagandy, the theme of the defeat of ancient Rome by Catholic Rome. Since a cross has been planted on the summit of the Colosseum in memory of the Christian martyrs, the huge building is depicted as itself a martyr, dying at the hands of its persecutor: Kolosseum, Riesenschatten Von der Vorwelt Machtkolo?, Liegst du da in Todsermatten, Selber noch im Sterben gro?? Und damit, verh?hnt, zerschlagen, Du den Martertod erwarbst, Mu?test du das Kreuz noch tragen, An dem, Herrlicher, du starbst! (11. 97-103; italics in original) [Colosseum, giant shadow of the ancient world's mighty colossus, are you lying in your death-throes, great even in dying? And in order that, mocked and shattered, 15 See Johann Pezzi, Faustin oder das philosophuche Jahrhundert [1783], ed. by Wolfgang Griep (Hildesheim, 1982): 'Es lebe, der deutsche Titus, die Lust des Menschengeschlechts, unser theure Joseph!'

The image amounts to a rather over-complicated conceit, elaborated further by (involuntarily?) recalling Byron's stanzas on the dying Gladiator.16 But the immediately following line, 'Nehmt es weg, dies heiige Zeichen!' [Take it away, this sacred sign!], shows, as Heinz Politzer points out, that the poem is not anti-Christian, or at least that Grillparzer was not wholehearted in his opposition to Christianity: 'Er glaubte seinem eigenen Unglauben nicht ganz' [He did not quite believe his own unbelief].17 While the poem's genre may be easy to recognize, its mode is less so. Instead of the dignified style of Humboldt, or the elegiac mode of Schiller's 'Die G?tter Griechenlands' [The Gods of Greece], which clearly helped to inspire the poem, we find a surprising number of puns. The monument to Septimius Severus should not be placed at the entrance ('Eingang') to the Forum, because Severus marked the end ('Ausgang') of Rome's military greatness (11. 25-28). Tourist guides have displaced orators: 'Rom hat nur noch Ciceron?n, | Aber keinen Cicero' [Rome has only cicerones, but no Cicero] (11. 55-56). The culminating stanza about the martyred Colosseum turns on the pun whereby the building, bearing a cross, is likened to Christ carrying the Cross. These puns would be out of place in a Schillerian elegy, or in a poem expressing personal feelings such as Politzer would like 'Campo vaccino' to be. They indicate that the mode of the poem is not so much elegiac as satirical and polemical, and thus in the tradition of Blumauer. If that is the right way to read the poem, it is less surprising that this polemic got Grillparzer into so much trouble. It was accepted for publication in the poetic yearbook ('Almanach') Aglqja, edited by his friend and mentor Joseph Schreyvogel. Since Schreyvogel, like Blumauer before him, held the office of censor, he should have been able to judge what was or was not acceptable. But the poem was denounced to the authorities, who insisted that it must be withdrawn from Aglaja, and Grillparzer had to explain it away in a letter to Count Sedlnitzky, the chief of police. For many years afterwards Grillparzer was haunted by what people called 'die Geschichte mit dem Papst' [the business with the Pope] (G rv, 109). Who denounced the poem is not known, but Grillparzer thought it was Zacharias Werner, and his twentieth-century editor Reinhold Backmann is 16 Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Book rv, stanzas cxl-cxli, in Byron, Poetical Worh, ed. by Frederick Page, 3rd edn (Oxford, 1970), pp. 245-46. 17 Heinz Politzer, Gr?llparzer oder Das abgr?ndige Biedermeier (Vienna, Munich and Zurich, 1972), p. 105.</page><page sequence="10">26 Poetry and Scepticism: Blumauer, Grillparzer, ^au inclined to agree.18 Zacharias Werner (1768-1823) was a prominent figure in the Romantic Catholic setting of post-Enlightenment Vienna. His fate tra gedy Der 24. Februar (written 1809, published 1815) inspired a whole genre, including Grillparzer's own Die Ahrifrau; his mythical dramas were widely read; and as a convert who entered the priesthood in 1814, he attained a high reputation as a preacher. Moreover, in the previous number of Aglaja he had published a poem, 'Italia', celebrating the triumph of Christianity in Italy, to which Grillparzer's poem may well be a deliberate rejoinder. Grillparzer's anti-clericalism finds ample expression in his occasional poems and epigrams. The dominant tone is set by his great commemoration of Joseph II, 'Des Kaisers Bilds?ule' [The Emperor's Statue, 1837], a poem supposed to be spoken by the Emperor's statue outside the National Library. Among other betrayals of his legacy, Joseph here condemns the tendency of quarrelsome priests ('streits?chtge Pfaffen', G , 254) to place factional alle giance above national loyalty. As early as 1826 Grillparzer equates the clergy with such vermin as gnats and bats ('M?ck und Fledermaus'), the latter, by their blindness, implying obscurantism ('Klerisei', G , 393). And as late as 1871, irritated by the proclamation of papal infallibility, he remarks that Christ undertook to found his Church on Peter but said nothing about Peter's successors ('P?pste', G , 591). In the intervening period Grillparzer was provoked especially by three events. The first was the expulsion in 1837 of four hundred Protestants from the Tyrol, which recalled to his mind the mass expulsion of heretics con ducted in the early seventeenth century by the Archduke Ferdinand, later the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, whose intolerance Grillparzer later castigated in Ein Bruderzwist in Habsburg.19 In his epigram Grillparzer warns the present Austrian Emperor, Ferdinand I, not to confuse himself with his over-zealous namesake ('Die Tiroler Religionsgeschichte', G , 423). Still more provocative was the affair of the Holy Coat of Trier. According to a tradition dating back to the twelfth century, this is said to be Christ's seamless garment (John 19. 23). Between 18 August and 6 October 1844 at least half a million pilgrims, organized by the Church and conducted by their local priests, visited Trier to see the Coat displayed in the Cathedral. This was no spontaneous outburst, but a carefully orchestrated demonstra tion of popular piety and of the Church's organization. Every parish in the diocese was assigned a day when its members were to venerate the Coat, and they went to the Cathedral in strict order, led by their priests.20 The Coat was said to have brought about a miraculous cure of the illness of Johanna 18 See Grillparzer, S?mtliche Werke, Historisch-kritische Gesamtausgabe, ed. by August Sauer and Reinhold Backmann, 43 vols (Vienna, 1909-48), i/x: Gedichte, Erster Teil (i932)&gt; 277"79 19 See Regina P?rtner, The Counter-Reformation in Central Europe.

In protest, the Catholic priest Johannes Ronge denounced in print the spiritual darkness ('Geisternacht') in which the Church left its adherents and the financial contributions it demanded even from bitterly poor manual workers who visited the shrine. Excommunicated, Ronge founded the German Catholic movement which sought a free national Church independent of Rome. It held its first Council in Leipzig in 1845 and attracted many middle class liberal Catholics, but after the failure of the 1848 Revolutions it was dissolved, and Ronge went into exile in England.21 In the pithiest of several epigrams on this affair, Grillparzer, in an ironically enlightened spirit, recommended the Vatican to adopt a rational oudook and thus make the German Catholics superfluous: Urn Ronges Spaltung zu erdr?cken, Braucht ihr kein weitres Mittel k?nftig, Wer fragt noch viel nach Deutsch-Katholiken, Sind erst die r?mischen vern?nftig. (G 1, 482) [To crush Ronge's schism, you won't need anything extra: nobody will care about German Catholics once the Roman ones are rational.] Grillparzer also shared the dismay of liberals at the Concordat concluded between the Austrian state and the Catholic Church in 1855. The Concordat restored and indeed extended the power of the Church over education, over all questions relating to the faith, including marriage law, over clerical appointments and discipline, and over the censorship of books that the Church judged objectionable.22 For liberals in education, such as Adalbert Stifter, Inspector of Schools in Upper Austria, these provisions were a deeply demoralizing blow.23 Grillparzer, more detached from their practical impli cations, responded with several scurrilous epigrams. One derides the Church's power of excommunication or cursing, contrasting it with the blessings that the restoration of ecclesiastical power is alleged to promise: Ob die fr?here Macht der Kirche frommt, Will man von neuem versuchen; Bis nun der erwartete Segen kommt, Treibt vorderhand sie das Fluchen.

A longer poem, 'Zeloten' [Zealots], mocks an 'Eifrer' or bigot who not only kneels before the image of the Virgin at Mariazell but also declares it an aesthetic masterpiece; this extravagant claim shakes the other believers out of their blind devotion, prompting them to discover that the image is a mere daub: Die Gl?ubigen sehen genauer hin Und jetzt erst belehrt sie der eigene Sinn, Als kritische Note zum gl?ubigen Text, Das Wunderbild sei nur eben geklext. (G 1, 357) [The faithful take a closer look, and now their own senses inform them, as a critical comment on a faithful text, that the miraculous image is merely a daub.] Empirical observation and aesthetic judgement, Grillparzer suggests, are a surer guide to truth than religious devotion. Ill Grillparzer's slender reputation as a lyric poet was easily eclipsed by Nikolaus Lenau, some ten years his junior. Each man was critical of the other's work. Lenau thought Grillparzer's poetry too dryly intellectual ('Bei ihm ist der Verstand alles'); Grillparzer thought Lenau too much the victim of an emotional pessimism which he failed to master intellectually.24 This was a clash of generations rather than of temperaments. Unlike the Josephinist Grillparzer, Lenau leaned towards a Romantic emotionality. But the pessimism they express is similar. We find the hints of cosmic pessimism present in such poems as 'Abschied von Gastein' developed by Lenau into a full-blown expression of Weltschmerz, while the anti-clericalism of Blumauer and Grillparzer appears fitfully in Lenau's work alongside a pessimism that is sometimes varied by an apparent return to theism. Lenau has a reputation as the key poet of Weltschmerz. The cosmic pessimism found in Schopenhauer, Heine, B?chner, Grabbe, and further afield in Byron, Vigny and Musset, is generally thought to be the very basis of Lenau's large body of lyrical and semi-dramatic poetry. But a closer look will show that matters are more complicated. Critics disagree about the extent to which Lenau's pessimism is predominandy personal, philosophical or rhetorical. His life was notoriously 24 See Michael Ritter, ?eit des Herbstes. Nikolaus Lenau.

But although he complains repeatedly of depression (variously called 'Melancholie', 'Schwermuth' or 'Hypochondrie'),25 he was clearly a quite different type of personality from the confirmed bachelors Blumauer and Grillparzer, with their notorious moroseness. While his lyric poetry may be Byronic in its dismissal of the world, his part-narrative, part-dramatic Faust is brisk and pointed, even recalling the satirical Byron of Donju?n. Although he read energetically in philosophy ? Spinoza, Herbart, Hegel and possibly Schelling ? the pessimism of his poetry hardly needed a philosophical foundation and is unlikely to be the expression of previously acquired philo sophical convictions. Weltschmerz^ the public profession of cosmic despair, was by the time Lenau began writing in the late 1820s a readily available literary attitude. To understand what Lenau did with it, we should bear in mind his rhetorical training. Richard Dove, in an indispensable but too little noticed article, has reminded us that Lenau was a craftsman who, rather than aiming to express certain feelings, set out to produce certain effects in his readers.26 His consciousness of his craftsmanship emerges clearly from such self-praising utterances as the following: Das, worin ich neu bin, worin ich Epoche mache in der deutschen Literatur, und worin mir keiner, wie viele Nachahmer auch schon aufgetreten sind, gleichkommt, ist meine Naturpoesie, meine poetische Durchdringung und Abspiegelung der Natur und ihres Verh?ltnisses zur Menschheit, ihres Ringens nach dem Geiste, meine Illustration der Natur. Meine effektvollsten Stellen sind jene, wo ich die Natur belauscht habe, die organische wie die menschliche. Diese meine Eigenschaft ist schon anerkannt und wird es noch mehr werden.27 [My originality, by which I mark an epoch in German literature, and in which nobody equals me, no matter how many imitators have appeared, is my nature poetry, my poetic grasp and depiction of Nature and her relation to humanity, her search for the spirit, my portrayal of Nature. My most effective passages are those where I have eavesdropped on Nature, both organic and human. This quality of mine has already received recognition, and will receive yet more.] However, although Dove is certainly right to query simplistic accounts of Lenau's sincerity, it remains the case that he found images of death and 25 Ritter, ?eit des Herbstes, pp. 92-93, 107, 152. 26 Richard Dove, 'The rhetoric of lament: a reassessment of Nikolaus Lenau', Orbis Litterarum, 39 (!984)&gt; 230-65. 27 Lenau und die Familie L?wenthal, ed. by Castle, pp. 104-05.</page><page sequence="14">30 Poetry and Scepticism: Blumauer, Grillparzer, L?nau destruction congenial, and that, while he was doubtless following a contem porary fashion for Byronic world-rejection, his success in doing so implies a more than merely opportunistic adoption of the theme. In Lenau's life and work we find, differently weighted, the conflict between religious faith and scepticism, between the desire to believe and the need to obey the authority of reason, that we have seen in Blumauer and Grillparzer. Both an attraction to Christianity, and a destructive Voltairean scepticism, can be found in Lenau's childhood. According to the biography by his brother-in-law Anton Schurz, the young Lenau was extremely devout. He loved to say his morning and evening prayers, to read Mass from a chair that served as an altar, and to preach so fervently that his mother and his nurse were reduced to tears. In adult life he recalled this devotion vividly: 'Auch noch als Mann sprach Lenau mit Entz?cken von der wahrhaft himmlischen Seligkeit, die ihn durchstr?mte, als er das erstemal, rein wie ein Engel, von der Beichte gegangen war' [Even as an adult Lenau would speak with delight about the truly heavenly bliss that filled him the first time he left confession, pure as an angel].28 This suggests not the rational religion of the Catholic Enlightenment but a more intense, emotional and above all theatrical form of religion, characteristic of the Romantic generation. But Schurz also tells us that in his late teens Lenau came under the influence of his uncle Sebastian Mihits (or Mihitsch), a lieutenant of hussars, with whom he stayed in Alt-Ofen (Buda). This uncle would read to him from Voltaire's correspondence with Frederick the Great and would tell him there was no God.29 The conflict between faith and reason is dramatized in Lenau's Faust. At least one contemporary, Anastasius Gr?n, recognized Faust as a portrait of the author: 'Lenau's Faust [ist] nur eine Individualit?t, allerdings eine gro?e und bedeutende, Niembsch-Lenau selbst' [Lenau's Faust is only an indi vidual, albeit a great and significant one, Niembsch-Lenau himself].30 But if Faust represents one aspect of Lenau, his antagonist Mephistopheles repre sents another. Faust is an egotist who recalls that during his pious youth, when he served as an altar-boy, he really wished to be God: Da? ich dem Gottesbild zu F??en Hab' knien und opferrauchen m?ssen, Mir schien's an meinem Werthe Spott: Da? ich nicht lieber selbst ein Gott.31 [That I had to kneel before the image of God and offer it incense seemed to mock my own merit: that I was not myself a God.] 28 Anton X.

At last he finds himself trapped in the confines of the self, from which he can escape only by the idealist suppo sition that he was always one with God and that his experiences were mere dreams. Mephistopheles, however, undermines all Faust's philosophical posi tions. Not only do his closing words deride Faust's desperate idealism, but earlier he has cogently pointed out that both Faust's attachment to Nature, and his alienation from it, are mere anthropomorphism: [. . .] ob die Natur Dir freundlich scheint und wohlgewogen, Ob feindlich grollend, beides nur Hast du in sie hineingelogen. (L in, 196) [Whether Nature was friendly and well disposed to you, or hostile and angry, both were lies that you projected onto it.] He even undermines Faust's theatrical defiance of God by remarking that blasphemy is a sign of belief in God: Seht meinen Freund hier, Doctor Faust, Wie hat er doch im Schiffe neulich, Als da der tolle Sturm gehaust, Auf seinen Gott gezankt so gr?ulich! Das war, verla?t euch drauf, mein Lieber, Noch immer was vom Glaubensfieber. (L in, 229) [Look at my friend here, Dr Faust! A short time ago, aboard ship, when the wild gale was raging, how dreadfully he denounced his God! Take my word for it, my dear fellow, that was a lingering touch of the fever of faith.] Lenau, however, could admit Mephistophelean irony only as a counterpoint to Faust's search for belief. Ironic and negative writing, such as he found in Heine and the Young Germans, was uncongenial to him.32 While Lenau rejected irony, however, it is not clear that he ever found refuge in a secure religious faith. He was not closely attached to the Catholicism in which he was brought up, being quite prepared, in 1844, to convert to Protestantism in order to marry Marie Behrends. Claims that he, at least temporarily, adopted definite Christian convictions are usually based on his epic poem Savonarola (1837).33 This poem in 995 quatrains places the Dominican preacher Girolamo Savonarola (1452-1498) in opposition to the 32 Ritter, ** des Herbstes, p. 148. 33 See Boshidora Deliiwanowa, 'Religion und Religionskritik in den Epen von Nikolaus Lenau', in Vergleichende Literaturforschung.

It was written under the influence of the Catholic mystic Franz von Baader (1765-1841), an opponent of papal absolutism, and of the Danish Protestant theologian Hans Lassen Martensen (1808-1884), a student of Hegel, Baader and the mystics.34 But the theistic interpretation probably owes much to the study of Lenau's Faust published by Martensen, who, according to Hugo Schmidt, used Lenau's work as a pretext for presenting his own view that rationalism must now give way either to unconditional faith or to despair.35 Lenau himself was not so sure that his work affirmed Christianity. He said of Savonarola: 'Die Zweifel meiner eigenen Seele klingen in den Versen' [My own soul's doubts resound in the lines].36 The poem, moreover, has a strong political element. Much is made of Savonarola's attempt to persuade the dying Lorenzo dei Medici to grant freedom to the city of Florence. The poem is an intervention in politics rather than in theo logy. It was intended as the second of three epics, the first dealing with Jan Hus and the third with Ulrich von Hutten. The only other epic that Lenau completed, Die Albigenser (1842), which recounts the Church's brutal extermi nation of the Cathar heretics of Provence in the early thirteenth century, is still more political, seeing the Albigensian heretics as unwitting actors in a long struggle for freedom and unexpectedly interpreting them as precursors not only of Hus and the Protestant reformers but also of the revolutionaries who stormed the Bastille in 1789. These epic poems need to be understood as protests against the ultramontanism of the reactionary Popes Gregory XVI and Pius IX.37 Attempts have also been made to relate Lenau's work to the pantheism which Goethe and his contemporaries constructed in opposition to what seemed the arid theism of late-Enlightenment theology. Herder wrote to the theist Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi: 'Gott ist freilich au?er Dir und wirkt zu, in und durch alle Gesch?pfe (den extramundanen Gott kenne ich nicht); aber was soll Dir der Gott, wenn er nicht in Dir ist und Du sein Dasein auf unendlich innige Art f?hlest' [God is of course outside you, working on, in and through all creatures (I know no God outside the world); but what can God mean to you unless He is within you and you feel His existence with infinite emotion].38 Goethe rejected the idea of an external God, operating mechanically on a lifeless Nature, in the famous lines: 'Was w?r ein Gott, der 34 See Ritter, Zeit des Herbstes, pp. 169, 179. 35 Hugo Schmidt, N?wfaus Lenau (New York, 1970), p. 120. 36 Letter to Emilie von Gleichen-Russwurm, 6 June 1838, in L vi/i, 22-23. 37 See Norbert Altenhofer, 'Ketzerhistorie und revolution?re Geschichtsphilosophie im Werk Lenaus', Vergleichende Literaturforschung, pp. 312-28, and Carl Gibson, Lenau. t?en ?

However, closer examination of some of his shorter poems will show that disillusioned pantheism is not the sole key to them, and that many passages that have often been considered pantheistic are not so. God is always represented by the symbol of the Cross, betokening the Incarnation, a concept difficult for pantheism to accommodate. Lenau does not seem definable as either a pantheist or a theist, disappointed or otherwise. His poetry gives the impression of seeking restlessly for something to believe in. It should be seen not as expressing convictions but as exploring beliefs that are only held provisionally. These explorations employ not so much theological ideas but rather Christian symbols which retain their emotional power even after the reality they point to has ceased to carry conviction. The early poem 'Glauben. Wissen. Handeln' [Faith, Knowledge, Action; originally 'Fantasie', 1830] presents the basic situation of the poetry in an allegorical narrative that moves from belief in God to disillusionment. The speaker recalls his youthful wandering through 'des Glaubens Paradiese' [the paradises of faith], accompanied by the figure of Life in the form of a veiled bride. Testimony to God's presence came both from the whispering of the breezes and from the howling of the gale. This lost paradise was not a pan theistic one. Natural forces spoke of God; they did not convey the direct presence of God. The ultimate message of Paradise refers to the Crucifixion, and is reported only as the speaker recalls his departure from Paradise: Doch zogen fort wir aus dem Paradiese, Wo jedes L?ftchen uns von Gott erz?hlt, Wo uns von ihm jed' Bl?mchen auf der Wiese Ein Liebeszeichen froh entgegenh?lt; Wo eine Blum' aus allen Blumen ragend, Prangt, hold umstrahlt vom rothen Morgenlicht, Die sch?nste Liebesbl?the Gottes tragend, Des todten Heilands l?chelnd Angesicht. (L 1, 8) [Yet we departed from Paradise, where every breeze tells us about God, where every flower in the meadow is glad to offer us a sign of His love; where one magni ficent flower, in the dawn's red beams, stands forth from all the rest, bearing the fairest blossom of God's love, the smiling face of the dead Saviour.] 39 Johann Wolfgang Goethe, S?mtliche Werke.

The speaker leaves Paradise ? voluntarily, it would seem ? for 'der Forschung W?lder5 [the forests of inquiry]. Instead of the cultivated flower garden, he finds himself in the thickets of a labyrinthine forest through which light can hardly penetrate. Eventually, however, a confused path leads him to the Tree of Knowledge, but a whisper from its foliage warns him that the fruit he seeks is inaccessible, because it hangs from slender boughs that will not bear his weight. Disappointed, he turns back to his bride, and finds that she has lost her veil and with it all her charms, like a rose withered by the frost. In the allegorical bride we recognize an image of Nature, recalling the veiled statue in Schiller's poem 'Das verschleierte Bild zu Sais' [The Veiled Statue at Sais, 1795] and its adaptation by Novalis in Die L?hrlinge zu Sais [The Apprentices at Sais, 1802]. Thus the speaker's attempt to understand the world by rational inquiry leads only to disillusionment, and when he and his bride turn back in the hope of regaining the 'Wunderblume' [miraculous flower] which may restore the bride to her former beauty, they are lost in a labyrinth with no prospect of finding the way back. The poem then introduces worshippers of a majestic lady called Germania, but on closer inspection she proves to be dead. Patriotism is no substitute for lost religious emotion. The speaker's companion assumes a second veil of grief ('Gram') which will remain with her until they both die: Erst wenn wir uns zu seligem Vergessen Hinlegen in das traute, liebe Grab, L?st er von Deinem Angesicht sich ab Und h?ngt sich an die s?uselnden Cypressen. (L 1, 11) [Only when we lie down in the beloved grave to enjoy blissful oblivion will it fall from your face and hang upon the murmuring cypresses.] The vivid specificity of the final phrase stands out against the extreme generality with which the poem hitherto has been formulated. After the alle gorical flowers and trees, the only scene imagined precisely is one which the speaker has not experienced and will not experience, since it will exist only after his death. This poem contains many motifs familiar from Lenau's subsequent lyrics. Yearning for a lost paradise is developed in 'Doppelheimweh' (1837), where our homesickness goes in two directions: we mourn for the earth, knowing that we must die; and we long for heaven, though the poem expresses no confidence that our yearning will be fulfilled: Das Erdenheimweh l??t uns trauern, bangen, Da? Lust und Leid der Erde mu? vergehn; Das Himmelsheimweh f?hlt's her?berwehn Wie Morgenluft, da? wir uns fortverlangen. (L 11, 101)</page><page sequence="19">RITCHIE ROBERTSON 35 [Earthly homesickness makes us tremble and lament that earth's joy and grief must pass away; it feels heavenly homesickness blowing past like morning air, so that we long to be gone.] The image of 'Morgenluft5 combines two suggestions. One is that we long to abandon our earthly lives and breathe the richer air of heaven. But the morning air also warns ghosts that they must cease wandering and return to their graves (as in Hamlet, i. 4. 58, whence 'Ich wittere Morgenluft5 has become a common German expression). It implies that our earthly life is that of a ghost. The poem then introduces the image of the song allegedly uttered by swans before they die: 'Dies Doppelheimweh t?nt im Lied der Schw?ne5 [This double homesickness is heard in the song of the swans], implying that the exceptional beauty of this song comes from the moment of death at which both yearnings are felt most acutely. Part of this idea is present also in 'Heimathklang5 [Sound of Home, 1835], where poetry is said to express yearning for the paradise from which every soul has been expelled; the myth of the Fall has now been combined with a Platonic myth of pre-existence (L , 112). That the search for scientific truth is futile is another favourite theme. In 'An die Biologen5 (1835; L n? I09) Lenau rebukes natural scientists for trying to discover the secret of life, which they can never hope to find, and similarly he represents Faust as an anatomist, indicating, as Friedrich Sengle says, 'da? die Wahrheit immer nur zur zersetzenden Analyse, zum toten Stoff und zum Anblick des Nichts f?hren kann5 [that truth can only lead to reductive analysis, to dead matter and the sight of nothingness].41 Even for non-scientists, Nature is presented as alien without God. The famous double sonnet 'Einsamkeit5 [Solitude, 1838] represents the desolation of Nature by a heath, where the wanderer vainly seeks emotional solace from the impalpable wind and the indifferent rocks, and even among his fellow humans, who are described by the alienating term 'Gesch?pfe5 [creatures] (L , 214). Worse than that, Nature may be hostile. 'Der Urwald5 (1835?) describes the American primeval forest as a scene where life grapples with death in a struggle in which death will always win. It has been pointed out that someone used to the relatively well-managed European woodlands would be taken aback by an American forest, where fallen and dead trees were only removed by natural decay.42 In 'Der Schiffsjunge5 [The Cabin Boy, 1834] a boy who falls overboard is swallowed up by the murderous but indifferent ocean: 'Klar blickt der alte M?rder Ocean | Dem Himmel zu, als h?tt5 er nichts gethan5 [Ocean, the old murderer, gazes serenely at the sky as though he had done nothing] (L 11, 24). Lenau5s landscapes are populated by vultures and crows, which eye defeated and wounded soldiers, deciding which ones each will devour ('Die Drei5 [The Three, 1842], L 11, 278). In 'Auf 41 Friedrich Sengle, Biedermeierzeit, 3 vols (Stuttgart, 1971-80), , 670. 42 See Mary C. Crichton, "'And no birds sing".

In the second part of the poem, the scene shifts to India, where we are invited to imagine that large numbers of Hindus and Muslims (incongruously called 'Gentlemen') have died of cholera, and that their unburied corpses are being devoured by ravens, vultures, wild dogs, jackals and storks. (If only there were a crocodile, we would have a neat anticipation of Kipling's story 'The Undertakers'.)43 This gruesome description is presented as an affirmation of Nature's maternal love ('Mutterliebe'), but critics have generally found it unconvincing. 'Wer kann in dieser ?ber alles Ma? gewaltsamen, ja grotesken Umdeutung den falschen Ton ?berh?ren?' [Who can miss the false note in this monstrously violent, indeed grotesque reinterpretation?] asks Walter Weiss indignandy.44 The grotesquerie of the scene, however, is not a false note but an intrinsic part of its presentation. Lenau is forcing upon us the ironic and grotesque paradox that bountiful Mother Nature feeds some of her children with the corpses of others. It is a change of perspective similar to the one Hamlet brings about when he describes the 'convocation of politic worms' feasting on Polonius {Hamlet, w. 3. 20). The antithetical language of the conclusion underlines the paradox and introduces a series of puns: Fort wird das Bild des Tods vom Lebenssturm getragen, Der Siegesruf verschlingt mir alle Todesklagen. Und mit den Geiern dort, die um die Leichen schwanken, Lass' fliegen ich am Strom Unsterblichkeitsgedanken. (L 11, 26) [The image of death is borne away by life's gale, the cry of victory swallows up all death-laments. And with the vultures there, that hover round the corpse, I let thoughts of immortality fly along the river.] The word 'verschlingt' not only recalls what the vultures are doing to the corpses' flesh, but picks up an earlier couplet: Die Schlange Cholera mit m?rderischer T?cke Verschlang sie rasch und spie sie schwarz und kalt zur?cke. (L 11, 25) [The serpent cholera, with murderous spite, quickly swallowed them and spewed them up again, black and cold.] And the speaker indicates that he is discarding ideas of immortality by saying that he lets them fly away, along with the vultures. Given the undignified language, the puns, the jarring Fremdwort 'Gentlemen', we should take this 43 See Rudyard Kipling, The Second Jungle Book (London, 1895). 44 Weiss, Entt?uschter Pantheismus, p. 101.</page><page sequence="21">RITCHIE ROBERTSON 37 not as first and foremost an affirmation of pantheism (as Weiss does), but as an exercise in the mixed poetic style. None of these poems can be taken as expressions of pantheism. Rather, they depict the play of natural forces in a manner familiar from Goethe's Die Leiden des jungen Werther [The Sufferings of Young Werther], especially from the famous passage that ends: 'Ich sehe nichts als ein ewig verschlingendes, ewig wiederk?uendes Ungeheuer' [I see nothing but a monster, eternally devouring and eternally chewing].45 Lenau is preoccupied with transience and death. Nature is not just empty; it has been abandoned by God. In the late 'Waldlieder' [Forest Songs, 1843?], m which a strong sense of pantheism at times comes to the fore, life and death coexist, though less drastically than in 'Auf meinen ausgeb?lgten Geier' and more lyrically: 'Es bl?ht die Welt in Todesbanden' [The world blooms in bonds of death]. A cemetery is overlooked by a crucifix, on which, in turn, sits a bird: Dort l?chelt auf die Gr?ber nieder Mit himmlisch duldender Geb?rde Vom Kreuz das h?chste Bild der Erde; Ein Vogel drauf, sang seine Lieder. (L 11, 309) [There, with a gesture of heavenly forbearance, the earth's supreme image smiles down from the Cross upon the graves; a bird upon it was singing its songs.] It is not the Cross, but the figure of Christ, that is 'das h?chste Bild der Erde'. But the word 'Bild' does not necessarily imply that the sign has any referent. It may be merely an image devised by the human imagination. That is suggested by the bird, a symbol of life, perched on the Cross, and by the speaker's turning to Nature for 'Heilung' ('healing', incorporating and thus relativizing the religious word 'Heil', salvation). Elsewhere Lenau imagines the Cross as damaged or broken. In 'Der tr?be Wanderer' [The Gloomy Wanderer; also entided 'Tr?ber Gang' (Gloomy Walk), 1830-31], the speaker sees the Cross, planted on the shore, broken by the waves in a high tide: Das Christuskreuz, vor dem in sch?nen Tagen Ein Kind ich, selig weinend, oft gekniet, Es h?ngt hinab vom Strande nun, zerschlagen, Dar?ber hin die Todeswelle zieht. (L 1, 113) [The Cross of Christ, before which, as a boy, I would often kneel in happy times, weeping with bliss, now hangs down from the shore, shattered, as the wave of death passes over it.] The Cross itself, without the figure of Christ, is the subject of the famous poem 'Das Kreuz' (1840 or 1841): 45 Goethe, S?mtliche Werke, i/viii: Die Leiden des jungen Werther, Die Wahlverwandtschaften, Kleine Prosa, Epen, ed. by Waltraud Wieth?lter (1994), p. 109.</page><page sequence="22">38 Poetry and Scepticism: Blumauer, Grillparzer, Lenau Ich seh ein Kreuz dort ohne Heiland ragen, Als h?tte dieses kalte Herbsteswetter, Das st?rmend von den B?umen weht die Bl?tter, Das Gottesbild vom Stamme fortgetragen. Soll ich daf?r den Gram, in tausend Z?gen Rings ausgebreitet, in ein Bildnis kleiden? Soll die Natur ich, und ihr Todesleiden Dort an des Kreuzes leere St?tte f?gen? (L n, 250) [I see a Cross there rise without a Saviour, as though this cold autumn storm that blows the leaves from the trees had borne the divine image away from the trunk. Shall I instead clothe in a metaphor the sorrow that is displayed in a thousand places? Shall I set Nature and her deadly sorrow in the empty place on the Cross?] Nature, once again, is pervaded by death. Its destructive forces are typified by the autumn wind, which sweeps away not only the leaves but apparendy also the image of Christ, and hence mankind's attempts to imagine a religious consolation. But Nature is here both the destroyer and the victim, showing the grief caused by its own ravages. Lenau imagines Nature suffering on the Cross instead of Christ. The idea of Nature's suffering occurs in other poems, such as 'Meeresstille' [Calm Seas; previously 'Adantica', 1833]: Tr?gt Natur auf allen Wegen Einen gro?en, ew'gen Schmerz, Den sie mir als Muttersegen Heimlich str?met in das Herz? (L 1, 269) [Does Nature bear on all her journeys a great, eternal pain, which she secredy infuses into my heart as her maternal blessing?] This idea is also embodied in the legendary tale, 'Der traurige M?nch' [The Sorrowful Monk, 1836?], where a knight takes refuge, one stormy evening, in a ruined tower in Sweden which is supposed to be haunted by a sorrowful monk. Although the knight does not take the legend seriously, the monk appears to him, and undeterred by the sign of the cross, turns on him a look of unutterable woe: Der gro?e und geheime Schmerz, Der die Natur durchzittert, Den ahnen mag ein blutend Herz, Den die Verzweiflung wittert, Doch nicht erreicht ? der Schmerz erscheint Im Aug' des M?nchs, der Reiter weint. (L 11, 35) [The great and secret pain that quivers through all Nature, that a bleeding heart may sense, that despair apprehends but does not attain ? that is the pain that appears in the monk's eye; the knight weeps.] The sorrow conveyed by the monk soon drives the knight to drown himself, together with his horse.</page><page sequence="23">RITCHIE ROBERTSON 39 How are we to understand this topos of Nature's suffering? Commentators have tried to fit it into Lenau's supposed pantheism. Walter Weiss draws attention to a remarkable passage in Schelling about the sadness of Nature: Die? ist die allem endlichen Leben anklebende Traurigkeit, und wenn auch in Gott eine wenigstens beziehungsweise unabh?ngige Bedingung ist, so ist in ihm selber ein Quell der Traurigkeit, die aber nie zur Wirklichkeit kommt, sondern nur zur ewigen Freude der Ueberwindung dient. Daher der Schleier der Schwermuth, der ?ber die ganze Natur ausgebreitet ist, die tiefe unzerst?rliche Melancholie alles Lebens. Freude mu? Leid haben, Leid in Freude verkl?rt werden.46 [This is the sadness that adheres to adi finite life, and even if God is at least relatively independent, yet He himself contains a source of sadness which is never realized but only serves the eternal joy of overcoming. Hence the veil of despondency which is spread over the whole of Nature, the deep, indestructible melancholy of all life. Joy needs sorrow, sorrow must be transfigured in joy.] However, this passage is very different from Lenau, both in its argumentative context and in its immediate emotional content. Schelling is explaining how human freedom is not only possible but necessary within a pantheistic uni verse, in which man is not identical with God (as claimed by Spinozism) but dependent on Him. The acceptance of our finitude as natural beings arouses sorrow, but its compensatory opposite is the joy that comes from approach ing God through activity. This latter notion is foreign to Lenau. The tone of the passage is also much milder than the language of 'Der traurige M?nch', which speaks not just of sorrow but of intense pain pervading all of Nature. For this concept there is a biblical reference point that was formerly fami liar to Catholics and Protestants alike, namely Chapter 8 of St Paul's Letter to the Romans, where the suffering of creation is acknowledged: Tor we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth together in pain until now' (Romans 8. 22); 'Dann wir wissen, da? alle Creatur seufftzen, und sich ?ngstigen noch immerdar.'47 They took comfort from St Paul's suggestion that such suffering resembled the pains of childbirth and would help ultimately to bring about the deliverance of Creation 'from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the kingdom of God' (Romans 8. 46 'Philosophische Untersuchungen ?ber das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit und die damit zusammenh?ngenden Gegenst?nde' (1809), in Schellings Werke, ed. by Manfred Schr?ter (Munich, 1927), Vierter Hauptband: Schriften zur Philosophie der Freiheit 1804-1815, p. 291. Weiss, Entt?uschter Pantheismus, pp. 74-75, quotes part of this passage (noting the dialectic that is absent from Lenau), misattributing it to a different work by Schelling. 47 Das Neue Testament unsers HERRN und Hey lands JEsu Christi, Nach der uralten gemeinen Lateinischen und von der Heil. Katholischen Kirch bew?hrten, und in derselbigen bishero allzeit gebrauchten ?bersetzung (Nuremberg, 1763). Luther's translation is significantly different: 'Denn wir wissen, da? alle Kreatur sehnet sich mit uns, und ?ngstet sich noch immerdar.'</page><page sequence="24">40 Poetry and Scepticism: Blumauer, Grillparzer, ^au 21), and that the conflict in Nature was a side-effect of Adam's fall.48 Tieck audaciously borrows St Paul's language in order to place cdie Seufzer und Klagen, die allenthalben in der ganzen Natur vernehmbar sind' [the groans and laments that are audible throughout Nature] within a narrative derived from Naturphilosophie, in which the organic world is explained as the inferior and moribund residue of past inorganic splendours.49 Often, however, they placed the greatest emphasis on the destructive energies of Nature. Thus M?rike's poem 'Die Elemente' [The Elements, 1824], which has Romans 8. 19 as its epigraph, evokes the turmoil of the elements in the person of an unruly giant, though it anticipates a future when the elements will be reconciled with God and at peace with one another.50 IV The author who develops this topos most fully is another Catholic, Annette von Droste-H?lshoff. An extended comparison between Lenau and Droste H?lshoff would be rewarding. Both were troubled souls who expressed much religious uncertainty, Droste from the side of faith, Lenau from that of scepticism. The topos of suffering Nature finds expression in a late poem by Droste, 'Die ?chzende Kreatur' [The Groans of Creation]. She was pressed to write it by her friend Christoph Bernhard Schl?ter, a lecturer in philoso phy at the Catholic Academy in M?nster; but Schl?ter, who was strictly orthodox in his views and thought she should write nothing but devotional poetry, was taken aback by the poem's uncompromising statement of the suffering present in Creation, culminating in the last two stanzas: Und dennoch giebt es eine Last Die Keiner f?hlt und Jeder tr?gt So dunkel wie die S?nde fast Und auch im gleichen Scho? gehegt Er tr?gt sie wie den Druck der Luft Gef?hlt vom kranken Leibe nur Bewu?tlos wie den Fels die Kluft Tr?gt er die Mord an der Natur 48 See .

That is the guilt of murdering the charm and grace of earth; it is the deep, heavy guilt of the torpid spell cast upon the animal kingdom, and of the fury that animates it, and of the cunning that pollutes it, and of the pain that tortures it, and of the putrefaction that covers it.] Droste moves onto something harder to envisage, the guilt for the suffering of Creation, which we do not feel consciously except in unusual states like that evoked early in the poem ('Gef?hlt vom kranken Leibe nur5), yet which weighs on us like the pressure of the atmosphere. The verb 'tragen' moves between an abstract sense (as in 'die Schuld tragen') and a direcdy physical sense of bearing a burden, as in a variant, 'Tr?gt er der Sch?pfung Todeswunden' [He bears Creation's deadly wounds].52 This implies that we are ourselves wounded, as a result of the injury which we have ourselves inflicted on Creation. We are unwittingly injured by our guilt in bringing about the fall of the natural world, in placing animals under their 'dumpfem Bann', and infusing them with the emotions ? fury, cunning and pain ? that presumably dominate their consciousness. The last stanza hammers home this message, beginning with a strikingly clumsy enjambement ('Das ist die Schuld des Mordes an | Der Erde Lieblichkeit und Huld', my emphasis) which nevertheless works poetically by conveying a sense of urgency. By comparison, Lenau's poetry seems more casual, playing with theologi cal ideas rather than imaging an existential commitment to them and their consequences. There is, nevertheless, a wide overlap between his and Droste's poetic subject-matter. Both are sufliciendy rooted in Catholicism to draw back before the fantasies of a godless universe that preoccupied poets of the Weltschmerz generation such as Heine, B?chner and Grabbe. Karl S. Guthke notes that on the few occasions when Lenau evokes ideas of an absent or evil God, he places them in the mouth of Mephistopheles, who in Faust refers to God as 'der ewige Despot' and 'der alte Zwingherr' [the 51 Annette von Droste-H?lshoff, Werke und Briefwechsel, Historisch-kritische Ausgabe, ed. by Winfried Woesler (T?bingen, 1978- ), iv/i, 207-09. 52 Ibid., p. 666.</page><page sequence="26">42 Poetry and Scepticism: Blumauer, Grillparzer, L?nau everlasting despot, the old autocrat; L in, 129, 139].53 The commonality between Lenau and Droste extends even to the way they imagine the end of the world. Droste, a keen amateur geologist, drew on the latest scientific speculations to envisage the earth, in the remote future, as a burnt-out desert ('Die Mergelgrube' [The Marl Pit, 1842]).54 In Lenau's 'Die Zweifler' [The Doubters, 1831?] one of the speakers imagines God ultimately destroying the world by freezing it, with as much satisfaction as He originally took in creating it: Dann br?tet auf dem Ocean die Nacht, Dann ist des Todes gro?es Werk vollbracht; Dann stockt und starrt zu Eis die grause Flut, Worin der Wunsch des finstern Gottes ruht; Er wandelt auf der Fl?che und ermi?t, Wie alles nun so still, so dunkel ist; Er l?chelt dann voll selbstzufriedner Freude In seine Welt, in seine Nacht hinein, Und es ergl?nzt des Eises stille Haide Nur noch von seines L?chelns Wiederschein. (L 1, 19) [Then night will brood upon the ocean; then death's great work will be accom plished; then the hideous flood, in which the desire of the dark God rests, will freeze into solid ice; He walks upon the surface and beholds how all is now so silent and dark; then He smiles, full of joyous self-satisfaction, into His world, into His night, and the silent wasteland of ice is lit only by the reflection of His smile.] Hugo Schmidt wrongly identifies the dark God here with Death, overlooking the fact that Lenau's fantasy still operates within a Christian conception of the Creation which is here reversed.55 The destruction of the world is the counterpart of its creation. By extinguishing the stars, God has undone the original act of creating light. He is now a dark god, whose spirit again rests upon the waters, enjoying the absence of anything that might threaten the divine egotism and pleased to find His own face reflected in the ice that covers the globe. In conclusion, Blumauer, Grillparzer and Lenau show the profound influ ence of the Austrian Enlightenment. To understand and appreciate poems that are not immediately accessible to the modern reader, we need to read them with some awareness of their authors' rhetorical training. If we do, we find a range of satirical and elegiac devices which express two aspects in particular of the Josephinist heritage. One is a confirmed opposition to the 53 Karl S.

The other is an attachment to Christian assumptions and images which proved more durable for these writers than for their Protestant counterparts.</page></plain_text>
