SHAFER The author agrees with Malcolm, although for different reasons, that dreams do not entail such psychological states as judging, deciding, experiencing emotions, having sensations, or wanting something. But the author disagrees with him and agrees with Descartes that one can intelligibly raise the question, Am I now asleep or awake?, in either sleep or waking life. In particular, the thought, I am now asleep, can occur during sleep, even concurrently with a dream. The author argues that such a thought would not be a case of knowing, realizing, or being aware that I am asleep because it would not be justified. But the author argues that it is always reasonable to assume I am awake, for even when the assumption is false it is harmless. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 21, No. 3, July 1984 Duty and Divine Goodness, THOMAS V. MORRIS Many theists hold (1) a broadly libertarian conception of moral freedom, (2) a view that divine goodness can be understood in moral terms, and (3) the conviction that God is necessarily good. The author details the problem which arises from these three commitments, considers various ways of avoiding the logical inconsistency which threatens, and suggests a view according to which God's goodness is interestingly * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of The Review.

Do Our Intentions Cause Our Intentional Actions?, IRVING THALBERG Suppose I desire Y and believe that if I do XI will get Y? or that I simply intend to do X. Most causal theorists of intentional or purposive action hold that whenever appropriate behavior on my part results, I do X intentionally?or for the purpose of securing Y But over the past two decades, eminent thinkers have produced seemingly knockdown counter-instances to such a causal analysis. The author asks whether the best known among these challenging examples are bonafide cases of action of the intended sort genuinely resulting from an agent's intention to do X Whether or not they are, the author assumes we can learn much about the central phenomena they involve?action, intention, desire, belief, causality?if we test out the examples and the assumptions underlying them. The Empirical Bases of Moral Scepticism, FRANCIS SNARE Certain empirically grounded claims about, and explanations of, moral beliefs, moral experience, and the diversity of moral beliefs can give support to "moral scepticism," i.e., the view that there are no moral facts or properties. This is not a meta-ethical thesis (i.e., purely a matter of a priori conceptual analysis of concepts we presently employ). Rather, moral scepticism is a certain sort of claim about what notions are required, or not required, in an account of the world most adequate for describing, explaining, predicting what there is. Privacy: Philosophical Dimensions, FERDINAND SCHOEMAN Mental Images and Cognitive Theory, J. CHRISTOPHER MALONEY On Some Vices of Virtue Ethics, ROBERT B. LOUDEN In recent years the revival of an ethics of virtue has been proclaimed by both philosophical and theological ethicists. However, in the course of the campaigning for virtue, theorists have failed to take note of certain shortcomings of virtue ethics?shortcomings which reveal a strong structural similarity to the very faults they have accused their rule-oriented competitors of making. In this essay, the author sketches some vices of virtue ethics, draws an inference about the philosophical source of the vices, and concludes with a recommendation concerning</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 157 future efforts in moral theory construction. The source of the vices, the author argues, lies in a mononomic or single-principle strategy within normative theory construction, a reductionist conceptual scheme which distorts certain integral aspects of our moral experience. The author's recommendation is that this strategy be abandoned, for the moral field is not unitary?mononomic methods are not the best tools for theorists. Blame, Punishment, and the Role of Result, RICHARD PARKER It is irrational and morally unjustifiable to blame and punish a person for a harm the causes of which lie outside that person's control. While most of us agree with this principle when it is put abstractly, we also presume moral blameworthiness and countenance criminal penalties that violate this same principle. In this article the author argues that when fortune, as well as an author's conduct, is responsible for a harm, the actor is blameworthy?and punishable?only for the conduct and not for the harm. Conduct is punishable for its risk-creating aspect, not for its actual harmful results. This thesis runs directly counter to the accepted view of criminal attempt, a variety of crimes of negligence and recklessness (e.g., involuntary manslaughter), and to the very notion of a crime. AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 62, No. 2, June 1984 Epistemic Importance and Minimal Changes of Belief, PETER G?RDENFORS The paper deals with the problem of describing contractions and revisions of states of belief. It is argued that the relative epistemic importance of the propositions accepted in a state of belief can be determined. When a state of belief is contracted or revised, some of the earlier accepted propositions must be derogated. The construction pre sented is based on the idea that the propositions that are retained are those with the greatest epistemic importance. The cognitive origin of the ordering of epistemic importance is discussed. The construction is then applied to some problems concerning counterfactuals and laws, and to a deontological problem about permission. Is There a Case for "Ad Hominem" Arguments?, G. JAMES JASON In a recent article, Lawrence Hinman has contended that in certain cases, ad hominem arguments are not fallacious. (See Hinman, "The Case for Ad Hominem Arguments," Australasian Journal of Philosophy, December, 1982). He cites several classes of cases: (1) cases in which a</page><page sequence="4">158 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS person offers premisses for which you have no corroborating evidence; (2) cases in which you suspect the other person has set the standards for inductive evidence too high or low; (3) cases in which a social group has beliefs about the origins of their practices; (4) cases in which you argue that the very fact that the other person has asserted something allows you to conclude that his assertion is false (transcendental argu ments). In these cases, Hinman argues that considering the background of the other person is logically acceptable. This article analyzes each alleged counterexample to the claim that ad hominem reasoning is always fallacious, and attempts to show that in each case, to the extent that inquiring into the background of the arguer is logical, it is only because some kind of testimony is being given. And examining the credibility of a witness does not amount to arguing ad hominem. Conditional Blindspots and the Knowledge Squeeze: A Solution to the Prediction Paradox, ROY A. SORENSON In "Recalcitrant Variations of the Prediction Paradox," the author criticized those who attempt to solve the paradox by rejecting either the KK principle or the temporal retention principle. In this follow-up article, the author first goes on to criticize attempts to reduce the prediction paradox to the liar. Second, the author offers a solution in the Quinean tradition (affirming that a last day exam will be unforseen). The task for those in this tradition is to provide a plausible explanation of how even an ideal thinker could be informed by the announcement of a surprise exam and yet not know the exam will take place on the only remaining day should a last day exam be given. The author argues that this strange epistemic behavior can be explained in terms of the "epistemic blindspots" involved. Begging the Question in Dialogue, J. D. MACKENZIE Many arguments which commit the fallacy of begging the question are formally valid. In the author's "Question-begging in non-cumulative systems" (Journal of Philosophical Logic 8 [1979]: 117-133), it is argued that a dialogical (two-person) account explains the fallacy. J. Woods and D. Walton in "Question-begging and cumulativeness in dialectical games" (Nous 16 [1982] 585-605), objected that that account wrongly prohibited dialogue in which the subject was changed. In the present paper, an analysis of the concept of argument provides an amendment to the original dialogical account. The account thus amended both escapes Woods's and Walton's objection and explains why begging the question is fallacious. An Argument against David Lewis' Theory of Possible Worlds, PETER FORREST and D. M. ARMSTRONG David Lewis' theory of possible worlds requires the notions of the class and the aggregate of all possible worlds. It is argued, however,</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 159 that these notions involve a contradiction. Given this putative class or aggregate, it is possible to construct a world having disjoint parts, each of which is an exact duplicate of just one world in the class (aggregate). Furthermore, it can be shown that this world is not a member of the class (part of the aggregate), thus producing a contradiction. Moral Realism and the Skeptical Arguments from Disagreement and Queerness, DAVID 0. BRINK In his book Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong, J. L. Mackie claims that there is a special problem with realism in ethics. He argues that the falsity of moral realism is the best explanation of moral disagreement and that the moral realist's metaphysical and epistemological claims are queer when compared with those of the physical or scientific realist. But neither argument is compelling. The moral realist has a plausible account of moral disputes; he can reasonably maintain that most genuine moral disputes are in principle resolvable on the basis of coherentist reasoning about both moral and nonmoral issues. Moreover, the moral realist's metaphysical and epistemological commitments are no stranger than those of the physical realist. Moral properties, like other natural properties, supervene ultimately upon physical properties, and our knowl edge of which physical properties moral properties supervene upon, like our scientific knowledge, is not foundational but highly theory-dependent. On Origins and Identities, JEFFREY TLUMAK Recently in the Australasian Journal of Philosophy Husain Sarker argued that origin is not a necessary condition either for identity of an individual or for being an instance of a biological natural kind, and that the identities of individuals and instances of all natural kinds can be explained in terms of structure or composition. The author agrees with the thrust of Sarkar's arguments, but thinks that some of what he says is inadequate. In this paper the author aims to advance the discussion by diagnosing some of these inadequacies and extending some of his points. INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 24, No. 1, March 1984 The Meaning of Body in Classical Chinese Philosophy, ROGER T. AMES The author attempts to reinstate the notion of body in our under standing of the early Chinese philosophical literature as a corrective against what the author perceives to be an inappropriate "psychologiz</page><page sequence="6">160 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS ation" of the materials. The author uses David L. Hall's (Eros and Irony) categories of polarity and duality to distinguish the classical Chinese presuppositions from Western philosophy, and to argue that for the ancient Chinese thinkers, mind and body are correlatives, under standable only by reference to each other. Given the process ontology that polarity entails, mind and body are one order of being differing in degree rather than kind. "Person," in this tradition, is properly regarded as a "psychosomatic process." INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 24, No. 2, June 1984 Legal Positivism and the African Legal Tradition, F. U. OKAFOR The legal systems and institutions we inherited from our colonial masters are not altogether alien to the African legal tradition. But some of the principles and concepts on which some specific legal practices are based are entirely alien to the traditional African legal experience. One such principle or concept which is widely held in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence is legal positivism. Legal positivism recognises as valid laws such enforceable norms as are enacted or established by the instrument of the state regardless of moral and teleological considerations. But in African legal experience there are two main sources of laws: human and divine sources. "Divine" here is used in contradistinction to "human" and therefore includes spirits and ancestors in the African religion. Both are authentic sources of valid laws in the traditional African legal context. Because of their moral and religious import, African positive laws bind the individuals in foro interno. Legal positivism in all its ramifications is in conflict with African ontology and its entire legal tradition as has been shown in the article. Foucault's Ground of History, JOHN W. MURPHY Although Foucault is presently viewed by many to be the premier historian of the social sciences, he is not thought to have advanced a philosophy of history. In this paper it is argued that he has proffered a philosophy of history, yet one that does not rely on the traditional theories of social development. Foucault's rendition of history is based on the writings of Nietzsche and thus change emerges from the "present," as opposed to teleological or evolutionary principles. Yet it is this "present" that is overlooked when Foucault's work is reviewed. The nature of this ground of history is discussed, along with its pertinent social implications. While using Bergson's imagery, it is suggested that Foucault's version of history is open because it is sustained by human discourse and not abstract forces.</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 161 Bar-Daisan: On Nature, Fate, and Freedom, BARRIE A. WILSON Bar-Daisan's The Book of the Laws of the Countries (referred to in antiquity as his dialogue On Fate) examines the complex interrelationships between nature, fate, and human freedom. This paper first of all provides some background on Bar-Daisan, his treatise, and Syriac culture in general. Secondly it examines his treatise philosophically, focusing on the structure of the dialogue and showing the systematic development of Bar-Daisan's position. Critical comments are made along the way on Bar-Daisan's argument. Attention is also placed on Bar-Daisan's basic philosophical terminology, especially his epistemological, metaphysical, and anthropological expressions. In this way a critical picture of Bar Daisan's position on human freedom is portrayed. Intuition and Argument in Philosophy: A Critique of Chisholm and Rorty, CHRISTOPHER W. GOWANS The author's purpose in this essay is to discuss the role of intuition and argument in philosophy through a critical examination of the approaches of Chisholm and Rorty (as exemplified particularly in their recent collections of essays). Chisholm is as good an example as any of the kind of analytic philosophy that is commonly practiced today, and Rorty is important because he rejects, from an informed position, precisely that kind of analytic philosophy. Moreover, both Chisholm and Rorty offer accounts of the role of intuition and argument in philosophy. In the author's view, however, both their accounts are inadequate. In the first place, both suggest that philosophy begins dogmatically with the arbitrary assumption of intuitions, and in the second place, they fail to give an approach to philosophy that is simultaneously rigorous and relevant to human concerns (Chisholm tending to opt for the former at the expense of the latter, Rorty the opposite). By reflecting on these inadequacies the author suggests an account of the method and purpose of philosophy that makes a place for both intuition and argument. Appropriation and Differentiation: Jaspers, Heidegger, and the Struggle of Existenz-Philosophy for the Existence of Philosophy, RICHARD WISSER This paper distinguishes the respective aims of Karl Jaspers's and Martin Heidegger's philosophical enterprises with reference to their radically divergent uses of the key terms "appropriation" and "differen tiation." The paper is developed with respect to Heidegger's thesis of "the end of philosophy and the task of thinking;" its point of departure is Jaspers's admonition that "philosophy must not abdicate, least of all today," which may be understood as the motto of his life and work. It has always been the essence of Jaspers's concept of philosophy that it</page><page sequence="8">162 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS "appropriate" tradition and validate its own possibilities in "differentia tion" from tradition. Starting with Being and Time Heidegger's "think ing," on the other hand, is concerned with the hermeneutics of the history of thought, whose "appropriation" transforms what has been transmitted so as to be liberated from it and to attain "full possession of one's own authentic possibilities of questioning." Accordingly Hei degger is not concerned, as is Jaspers, over the "gold" of the "perennial philosophy" but, against the background of the "question of Being," over the "destruction" of Western philosophy as such. Jaspers's "philosophy" is thus meant to be seen as the decisive attempt to save philosophy in the Twentieth century in the face of Heidegger's destruction of the ontological heritage. Rorty cm Objectivity, Truth, and Social Consensus, KENNETH T. GALLAGHER The Idea of a Personal History, JONATHAN JACOBS JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 81, No. 4, April 1984 Morality and Self-Other Asymmetry, MICHAEL SLOTE The paper explores a previously-neglected difference between com monsense morality and act-consequentialism (or act-utilitarianism). Commonsense morality treats it as permissible to sacrifice one's own (greater) good (for the lesser good of another) and is thereby committed to an asymmetry regarding what an agent may do to herself or to others in the conferring of benefits. This asymmetry turns out to be very difficult to justify either from an impersonal utilitarian/consequentialist standpoint or via the resources of ordinary moral thinking, and the asymmetry also infects commonsense deontological restrictions: one may not inflict harm on another person in order to prevent some even worse train of events, but may be morally permitted to inflict a similar harm on oneself in order to prevent such a worse outcome from occurring. The self-other asymmetry of common deontological restrictions is shown to raise some new and seemingly intractable problems for the justification of such restrictions. Gentle Murder, or the Adverbial Samaritan, JAMES W. FORRESTER After a brief look at some earlier and unconvincing versions of the good Samaritan paradox, the author presents his own variant. The</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 163 paradox of gentle murder uses principles of deontic logic, an adverbial detachment, and some apparently consistent legislation to derive a self contradiction. From an examination of the premises of the paradox of gentle murder, and by a process of elimination, the author concludes that a well-known principle of standard deontic logic needs to be corrected. The Alleged Repugnance of Acting from Duty, MARCIA BARON Drawing on discussions by Michael Stocker, Bernard Williams, and Susan Wolf, the author tries to pinpoint just what it is about acting from duty that makes it seem morally repugnant. The author does so with the aim of vindicating acting from duty, but only by isolating certain forms of acting from duty which are less than ideal modes of conduct. The author argues that there is some truth to the charge of moral repugnance but that the repugnance attaches not to acting from duty as such, but to certain ways of acting from duty and certain character flaws which are in no way constitutive of or endemic to acting from duty. At the same time the author offers a sketch of how acting from duty should be understood, suggesting that it involves a commitment to doing whatever one morally ought to do, a commitment which governs all of one's conduct, not just isolated actions. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 81, No. 5, May 1984 Belief and the Will, BAS VAN FRAASSEN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 81, No. 6, June 1984 Evaluating the Emotions, STEVEN ROSS The essay takes up and critically explores traditional conceptions of the emotions and the conceptions of evaluation that follow from them. In doing so, the essay also raises certain questions regarding the alleged structure an evaluation or justification must exhibit if it is to be termed "genuine" or "in order." The essay argues that not only do the traditional conceptions invariably distort certain crucial features of the emotions and of our evaluations of them; it is also the case that these conceptions are offered against a mistaken idea of what evaluations must be like if they are to be philosophically respectable. Drawing on an analogy with</page><page sequence="10">164 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS the use of aesthetic terms before critical contexts, the essay argues traditional conceptions make a "category mistake" in seeming to assume that either our evaluations name some descriptive referent or they name nothing at all. Consistency in Rationalist Moral Systems, ALAN DONAGAN An investigation whether rationalist moral systems (such as Aqui nas's theory of natural law and Kant's "metaphysics of morals") cannot be consistent because they do not exclude moral dilemmas (possible situations to which they apply in which they require two kinds of action that cannot both be performed). A defense of rationalist rejections of different arguments by van Fraassen, Marcus, and Williams that systems allowing moral dilemmas can be consistent. It is concluded that, corrigible blemishes apart, various rationalist moral systems (including Aquinas's and Kant's) have not been shown to allow moral dilemmas simpliciter, and that the prevalent impression that they have been has three sources: confusion of practical conflict generally with moral conflict, confusion of dilemmas simpliciter with dilemmas secundum quid, and neglect of those systems' casuistical resources. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 81, No. 7, July 1984 Teleology, Error and the Human Immune System, MOHAN MATTHEN and EDWIN LEVY The authors attempt to show that certain forms of behavior of the human immune system are illuminatingly regarded as errors in that system's operation. Since error-ascription can occur only within the context of an intentional/teleological characterization of the system, it follows that such a characterization is illuminating. It is argued that error-ascription is objective, non-anthropomorphic and irreducible to any purely causal form of explanation of the same behaviour. It is further argued that it would not be right to regard all errors of the immune system as due to malfunction or maladaptation. Parallels with the theory of human action are stressed. Causal Models with Frequency Dependence, RONALD N. GIERE In a recent note ("Frequency-Dependent Causation," The Journal of Philosophy 79 [1982]: 247-253), Elliott Sober has presented several ex amples from evolutionary biology which he claims to be "counterinstances" to the author's account of causal hypotheses (as developed in "Causal Systems and Statistical Hypotheses," in L. J. Cohen and M. B. Hesse, eds., Applications of Inductive Logic [Oxford: Oxford University Press,</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 165 1980], pp. 251-270; and in Understanding Scientific Reasoning 2nd ed. [New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1979, 1984]). Sober assumes the authors account to be a reductive analysis of causality based on counterfactuals. The author's aim, however, has been to develop models of causal contexts useful in understanding a variety of causal hypotheses and methodological strategies. Nevertheless, Sober's examples provide a convenient means for exploring the strengths and weaknesses of the author's approach. In this paper the author briefly describes those aspects of the author's account to which Sober's examples are directly relevant, and then examines the lessons to be learned. JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 22, No. 2, April 1984 Marin Mersenne and the Probabilistic Roots of "Mitigated Scepticism, " PETER DEAR Richard Popkin's view of Mersenne's epistemological position as anti-Pyrrhonian "mitigated scepticism" is elucidated with reference to the humanistic nature of Mersenne's Jesuit dialectic training. It is argued that "mitigated scepticism" was a direct outgrowth of the mild form of academic scepticism associated with Cicero which infused hu manist dialectic. Mersenne's choice of mathematics, syllogistic logic, and immediate sense perception as the basis of his approach to natural philosophy was provided by those sources of certainty admitted by humanist dialectic; Mersenne countered Pyrrhonism by stressing these at the expense of merely probable subject-matters which formed the focus of the dialectic taught by the Jesuits. Thomas Brown's Theory of Causation, JOHN A. MILLS The article is a critical review of the theory of causation of Thomas Brown (1778-1820), the Scots philosopher. The author pays some attention to all three versions of Brown's theory but deals most extensively with the third (Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect). Having expounded the general features of the theory, the author summarizes Brown's criticism of Reid and of the principle of sufficient reason. The author deals at length with Brown's criticisms of Hume's theory of causation. He concludes that the major difference between Brown and Hume resides in Brown's espousal of an intuitive principle that, he claimed, allowed us to be certain that, given the antecedent, we could infallibly predict the consequent. The author claims that Brown confused the defining characteristics of causation with actual causal operations, so that, despite the historical interest of Brown's theory, it is ultimately inferior to Hume's.</page><page sequence="12">166 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Aristotle's Wish, ALFRED R. MELE The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the role of wish (boul?sis) in Aristotle's theory of action and to clarify thereby his conception of ethical action and of the parts played by thought and desire in the generation of action of this sort. It is argued that boul?seis are reflective of general action-policies constituted in part by lived conceptions of the good; that the thinking-to-be-good which Aristotle closely associates with wish is dependent upon, and indicative of, such a conception; that wish's dependence upon a conception of the good is what places it in the rational part of the soul; and that certain problems concerning the relationship of wish to choice are not symptomatic of an irreparable flaw in Aristotle's account of ethical action. It is suggested, finally, that Aristotle's notion of boul?sis has interesting implications for an account of human autonomy. The Esse/Essentia Argument in Aquinas's "De ente et essentia," SCOTT MACDONALD The argument in chapter 4 of Aquinas's De ente et essentia has received a great deal of attention from commentators primarily because of its relevance to understanding Aquinas's views on the distinction between essence and existence. This paper sets out a detailed reconstruc tion of Aquinas's argument, which the author argues best represents the text, and offers an interpretation of Aquinas's position in De ente 4 based on the reconstructed argument. The author argues on the basis of the reconstructed argument that Aquinas establishes a real distinction between essence and existence before he establishes that God exists and that the view, defended by Joseph Owens, that Aquinas cannot have established a real distinction at such an early stage of the argument rests on a mistaken understanding of the nature and structure of the argument. JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 22, No. 3, July 1984 The Energeia-Kinesis Distinction and Aristotle's Conception of Praxis, CHARLES T. HAGEN In a well-known passage in Metaphysics IX, 6, Aristotle classifies actions as either energeiai or kineseis. Recently Daniel Graham has argued that a correct understanding of the perfect-tensed verb forms as they appear in the so-called tense test in that passage shows that Aristotle's energeiai are states rather than activities. According to Graham, and he has been joined in this view by Michael White, Aristotle is thus pointing to states as the highest form of praxis. The author argues that Graham's conclusions do not follow from Aristotle's use of</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 167 the perfect tense in the Metaphysics passage and that there is ample evidence elsewhere in the corpus to show that energeiai are not states. Developing Terry Penner's analysis of the energeia-kinesis distinction, the author locates the basis of energeiahood in Aristotle's teleology and discusses the connection between that teleology and the Aristotelian conception of praxis. Descartes' First Meditation: Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, LEO GROARKE Where it is often argued that the highest good is an important concept in Kant's interpretation of morality, in this paper the author seeks to argue that it is indeed an important concept. Its importance, however, does not lie, as some have argued, in providing a content to complement the formal character of the moral law. Rather the author believes that the highest good functions in Kant's analysis as a necessary condition of the possibility of the moral law. Unless the natural order is understood to be under the hegemony of the moral order the moral law cannot claim objective status. The highest good secures the possibility of the law by establishing its priority over nature. Without this priority the moral law would be understood to legislate only within the conscience of the individual, losing its connection to the world outside of conscience and thereby exposing the law to the charge of subjectivism. The highest good insures the objectivity of the moral law. Spinoza's Ethical Doctrine and the Unity of Human Nature, DIANE STEINBERG In this paper the author is concerned with the question of how to reconcile Spinoza's apparent ethical egoism with his views that (1) there would be no conflicts between men if all acted according to reason (E IV, 35), and (2) the free man would never act deceitfully, even to save his own life (E IV, 72). The author argues that the usual rationale for his view that the true interests of all men will always coincide (viz., that the highest good is non-competitive and that nothing is more valuable to a man than another man who lives according to reason) is inadequate, and that E IV, 35 rests on an entirely different line of thought, viz., that all men share a common human nature. The author then examines what it means in Spinoza's metaphysical system to attribute a common human nature to all human beings, and suggest that Spinoza viewed mankind as a complex mode of which each individual human being is a part. Finally, the author examines the demonstration of E IV, 72 and show how this conception of the unity of mankind enables us to make sense of both the proposition and its demonstration. Was Nietzsche a Cognitivist?, KENNETH WESTPHAL Does Nietzsche claim to know anything? Does he need to make such claims in order to fulfill his broader philosophical aims? Do his</page><page sequence="14">168 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS own epistemological views entitle him to make such claims? The author argues for affirmative answers to the first two of these questions and formulates several issues pertinent to resolving the third. It is hoped that posing these issues will help focus controversies among divergent groups of Nietzsche interpreters. The Importance and Function of Kant's Highest Good, R. Z. FRIEDMAN MIND Vol. 93, No. 370, April 1984 Seeing the Present, J. BUTTERFIELD The author believes the present, like the here, is an epistemic notion reflecting our limited access to a temporally and spatially extended reality. But this analogy between the present and the here is threatened by some strong intuitions; e.g., we think of ourselves as sharing a common present, while we each have a different here. He explains away this and two other intuitions, one about existence and one about truth. The explanation uses a general but contingent fact that defenders of the present-here analogy have hitherto ignored: that in observation and communication time-lags are usually short enough to be ignored. On the Nature of Rights, J. RAZ A person has a right if his interest is sufficient to hold another to be subject to a duty. A person is capable of having rights if his well being is intrinsically valuable. The analysis is applied to distinguish between core and derivative rights, to explain conflicts of rights, and to explain the failure of universal instantiation in rights statements. Rights to promise and under a promise are explained in terms of an interest in being able to forge special relations with people. Rights are grounds of duties, which are themselves based on interests. They generate new duties as circumstances change. Most theses about the correlativity of rights and duties disregard this dynamic character of rights. Rigidity and Scope, A. D. SMITH Events and Explicative Definitions, G. N. SCHLESINGER One of the most important rules governing adequate definitions is that the definiens must be conceptually prior to the definiendum. Some</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 169 of the famous attempts to offer a rigorous definition of the identity conditions for events are shown to have violated this fundamental rule. The paper concludes with a definition of the identity of these conditions in terms of physical systems remaining identical from one moment to the next. An Evidentiary Theory of Promues, J. P. W. CARTWRIGHT While philosophers disagree about why promises obligate, few deny that they do. One who does is P. S. Atiyah in Promises, Morals and Law (Oxford, 1981). He argues that promises do not themselves yield obligations, but are to be construed as admissions of, as evidence for, obligations that either already exist or may come to exist and that derive from some source other than the promise. The two principal sources of such obligations, he says, are the conferment of a benefit upon the promiser by the promisee or the infliction of harm upon the promisee by the promiser. Against Atiyah it is argued here that the obligation to keep promises cannot be regarded as an application of the wider obliga tions to make return for benefits conferred and not to harm others, nor can promises be regarded as admissions of obligations grounded elsewhere than in the promise. The Principle of Equality: A Reply to Nathan, T. HONDERICH Lowe on Modalities "De Re, " T. BALDWIN The article deals with the issue of de re modalities and focuses on the use of a predicate modal operator to express them, as proposed by Wiggins some years ago. It is argued that although the details of Wiggins's proposal are unsatisfactory, one can take from it an attractive view which enables one to make better sense of ascriptions of de re modalities than is otherwise possible. This view is then contrasted with those proposed by Lowe (in a recent article in MIND) and Stalnaker and Thomason (in a famous article in Theoria [1968]), and shown to be superior to them. Frege on Thoughts, G. CURRIE Why Nozick is a Sceptic, A. L. BRUECKNER Why Time is Extensive, G. PLUMER The word 'now'. Schlesinger raises it, Barrett capitalizes it, and Capek puts quotation marks around it when he isn't mentioning it. The</page><page sequence="16">170 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS author thinks it is crucial for advocates of the commonsense transient view of time to get clear about the reason for employing such a device. Using Schlesinger's "NOW"-device as a case in point, the author shows that a seemingly watertight argument for the opposing static view of time can be constructed by questioning the device's raison d'?tre. This argument centers on the idea that the only ordinary use for the word 'now' is to refer to a moment virtually simultaneous with its utterance. As just one moment among the extensive series ordered by the earlier than relation, in no sense does such a moment move. He then attempts to turn this argument around by showing that the transient view can explain why time is extensive, and the static view can't. The reversal hinges on the point that duration is generated by continuance of the present?such that 'the present' here is used in a nontechnical, nonin dexical, and nonreflexive sense, which in fact Schlesinger gives to 'now' (by "NOW"). Consciousness and the Exclusivity of Function, E. R. KRAEMER The argument has recently been made that if functionalism were a correct account of mental phenomena, then consciousness could have no function. This argument is based on the claim that function attributions are exclusive. In this discussion the author argues that the exclusivity of function attributions does not follow, as has been claimed, from evolutionary considerations. He further demonstrates (i) that such a stricture on the attribution of functions would have improbable conse quences for biological science, and (ii) that this stricture is, furthermore, compatible with consciousness (as construed by the functionalist) having a function. MIND Vol. 93, No. 371, July 1984 The Incorrigibility of the Cogito, J. HARRISON Though the propositions that I exist, that I believe something, or that I am mentally modified must be true if I believe them, this does not show that the way in which I cannot be mistaken about them entails that I know them. For the proposition that, if I believe I exist, what I believe must be true, is true in virtue of the principles (i) that whatever is modified in some way must exist to be so modified, and (ii) that if I believe that something is so, and it is so, what I believe must be true. It is not true because of my reliability on such matters. The belief that, if I think I think or think I am mentally modified, I must think or be mentally modified, rests on the principle that such beliefs are self verifying, which there is room to doubt, and also has nothing to do with my inerrancy.</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 171 Sceptical Confusions about Rule-Following, S. G. SHANKER The author challenges the "sceptical" interpretation of Wittgenstein's discussion of rule-following in Philosophical Investigations, as set forth by Saul Kripke in Wittgenstein: On Rules and Private Language. Kripke believes that "Wittgenstein has invented a new form of scepticism . . . the most radical and original sceptical problem that philosophy has been to date." The author argues that Kripke has misinterpreted what was intended to be read as a sustained reductio ad absurdum. The purpose of this argument is to demonstrate the incoherence of these so-called "sceptical" considerations by showing how they lead into the "paradox" stated at ?201 that there can be no such thing as following a rule, and hence the very notion of speaking a language collapses. Such a patently absurd conclusion is intended to force us to reconsider the misguided conceptions of meaning and understanding which have landed us in such a dilemma. Fragmentary Sense, P. CARRUTHERS For a Fregean, sense is unitary: it is that a knowledge of which will constitute a speaker's grasp of what is represented by the content of any complete linguistic utterance which he understands, no matter whether that utterance is made by himself or by some other speaker, and no matter what form the utterance takes (e.g., statement, question, com mand). Against this, the author argues for the fragmentation of the notion of sense along two different fault-lines: first, he argues that the notion needed to explain the representative function of language is not the notion needed to explain (factual) communication; and secondly, he argues that the notion needed to explain factual communication is not the notion needed to explain communication in other regions of linguistic intercourse, such as the imperative. An Alleged Difficulty Concerning Moral Properties, J. C. KLAGGE The author argues against Blackburn, that the moral realist can offer an acceptable account of supervenience even in the absence of analytic entailments from naturalistic descriptions to moral judgements. The necessity involved in the supervenience relation must be interpreted as metaphysical rather than logical necessity. The author distinguishes between weak supervenience, which governs objects in the same possible world, and strong supervenience, which governs objects in the same or in different possible worlds. The realist should endorse strong superve nience. The author offers logical formalizations of the various conditions one might wish to place on the truth of moral judgments. Finally, the author raises the question of whether there might be special reasons why metaphysical necessity is not applicable to morality.</page><page sequence="18">172 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Double Effect and Moral Character, N. RICHARDS Does it matter, morally, whether a particular outcome is intended or merely foreseen? Less so than the absolutist insists, the author argues, but more so than the consequentialist allows. Its significance is in its revelation of the agent's character. Roughly speaking, to intend a certain unfortunate outcome enacts worse character than only to act with the realization that it will occur. To intend the outcome is, thus far, a worse thing to do. This is only "roughly speaking," however, which is why (for example) it would not be worse for the trapped spelunkers to intend to kill the fat man when they blast him out of the cave-mouth. Following the necessary discussions of what it is to intend an outcome and to enact a trait of character, applications to other standard examples are provided. The Asymmetry of the By-relation, D. H. SANFORD Sam signaled a turn by extending his arm out the window. Diffi culties in explaining the asymmetry of the by-relation in examples such as this by reference to acceptable and unacceptable counterfactual conditionals are explored by Hugh J. McCann in "The Trouble with Level-Generation" (Mind, October 1982). I refine and defend the following alternative account of one-way dependence of Y on X: not only is X necessary for Y, but something else, independent from X, is also necessary for Y, but there is nothing independent from Y such that it and Y are each necessary for X. Explaining the asymmetry of the by-relation in this example is independent from deciding whether or not Sam's extending his arm is identical with his signaling. Death and Bodily Transfiguration, W. R. CARTER Do people perish at the time of their biological death? Many philosophers argue that they do. The author believes that this is a mistake. If, as the author believes, a person is identical with his or her body, then people generally continue to exist for some time after they die. The corpse that lies in the morgue is (diachronically identical with) the person who only hours ago was the victim of a fatal accident. Bodies, Corpses, and Chunks of Matter?a Reply to Carter, J. F.

RYCKMAN</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 173 Davies on Recent Theories of Metaphor, D. E. COOPER THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. 58, No. 3, Summer 1984 Can Virtue be in the Service of Bad Acts?: A Response to Philippa Foot, JANET E. SMITH In her essay, "Virtue and Vices," Philippa Foot argues against Aristotle and Aquinas that virtue can be in service of bad acts; that is, for instance, she argues that a murderer may display the virtue of courage as he commits the villainous deed of murder. She also argues that some characteristics called virtue, such as prudence, are not in all cases virtues. In this essay, the author attempts to show through a close analysis of Foot's arguments, that she makes this claim on the basis of a definition of virtue quite radically different from that of the ancients. Specifically, whereas the classical philosophers understood virtue to refer to a certain configuration of the powers of the soul, Foot identifies the products of virtue with the virtue. Furthermore, the very analogies she uses to argue her point, in themselves, indicate an erroneous understanding of the common and proper usage of terms. This confusion over the meaning of terms and consequently of the nature of the subject under consideration, namely virtue, should be avoided for it can only muddle investigation into the usefulness of the concept of virtue for ethical analysis. Structures, GERALD F. KREYCHE This paper is an attempt to portray in various cultural activities of man, the structuring and constitutive work of the mind. It brings together examples from the areas of religion, literature, language, philosophy of science, etc. Its conclusion is that our knowledge of things is not objectivistic, in any absolute sense, nor purely subjective. Rather, our knowledge is relative, but by no means on that account, arbitrary. In short the paper is a critique of knowledge and the human condition. Quine and Aristotelian Essentialism, DOUGLAS B. RASMUSSEN Due to the prominance Quine's facile criticism of Aristotelian essentialism has attained in the philosophical community, careful and repeated consideration of his criticism seems necessary. By showing (1) that Quine has a confused view of Aristotle's distinction between essential and accidental predicates, (2) that Quine unnecessarily assumes that the essence of X is determined in an analytic or linguistic fashion, and (3) that Quine needlessly makes a Kantian turn, though in highly modified form, when he argues against our ability to know what X really is, this</page><page sequence="20">174 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS essay seeks to show that Quine has not proven Aristotelian essentialism to be absurd or cognitive realism to be impossible. In a more constructive vein, this essay suggests what the criteria are for determining X's nature and what cognitive role real definitions play in determining that nature. The Divine Immutability: Some Recent Challenges, THEODORE J. KONDOLEON In this paper the author attempts to defend the traditional philo sophical view that God is immutable both by arguing the conceivability and propriety of such a divine attribute and by showing how some recent challenges of the divine immutability, notably those by Hill and Clarke, also entail a denial of divine omniscience and divine providence. The author also addresses the problem of whether God's eternal knowledge would have been otherwise if He had not created and thus whether creation involves change in God. Finally, the author addresses the charge that God as an object of religious worship and His rational creature's love cannot be upheld if He is not in some way understood to be really related to His creatures so that their existence does make a difference to Him. Maritain and Science, STANLEY L. JAKI Maritain's precocious wrestling with philosophical questions was followed by parallel studies of philosophy and of the biological sciences at the Sorbonne. A review, based on his school records, of his scientific studies and of his passing infatuation with scientism serves as a background for a portrayal of Maritain's analysis of science. Special attention is paid to his major work, The Degrees of Knowledge (1932), where that analysis appears in its most systematic form. It is found that although not trained in the exact sciences, Maritain achieved an accurate and penetrating grasp of the new physics (relativity and quantum mechanics), as they developed in the 1920s, and of the true nature of problems presented by them for time and causality. Maritain should be given special credit not only for his having coined the word scientism but also for his courageous denunciation of scientism as a principal cultural evil of our times and as a major threat to philosophical sensitivity. Curiously, Maritain failed to appreciate the cosmology issuing from general relativity. NOUS Vol. 18, No. 2, May 1984 Identity, Fuzziness and Noncontradiction, LORENZO PENA That identity is self-contradictory may stop being a ground for waiving it, thanks to paraconsistent logics. Furthermore, well established</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 175 logical principles together with the acceptance of fuzzy sets and facts lead to admitting that self identity is a true contradiction. Instead of enjoining rejection of the principles of noncontradiction and excluded middle, fuzziness entails those principles' truth even though it also entails negations of some instances thereof. Fuzzy logic is shown to be worth working not because of its greater ontological neutrality, but in virtue of cogent arguments shoring up a fuzzy ontology. The paper gives a proof-theoretic characterization of well-behaved fuzzy logics and shows that they are paraconsistent, since they have the endorsement-rule (whatever is more or less true is true). The paper then sketches an infinite-valued paraconsistent logical system?transitive logic?which is a conservative extension of classical logic and avoids fixes afflicting several nonclassical logics, such as omega-overinconsistency. Forms and Participants in Plato's Phaedo, MOHAN MATTHEN At Phaedo 74 B7-C6, Plato gives an argument in support of the conclusion that "those equals are not identical with the equal-itself." It is usually supposed (a) that the "those equals" in the conclusion refers to the equal sticks of a few lines earlier and (b) that the conclusion so interpreted advances Plato's purposes by demonstrating the non-identity of forms and participants, (b) is misguided. What Plato is trying to demonstrate is that the form is not sensibly knowable; and non-identity will not secure this. It is therefore proposed that the conclusion above asserts the non-identity of forms with the sensible relations present in equal sticks. Some of the consequences of this for our understanding of Plato are explored. Causal Priority, DANIEL HAUSMAN "Causal Priority" presents and defends a truth condition (strongly influenced by recent work of Douglas Ehring's) for "X causes, or is a causal condition of Y," where X and Y are individual events. The paper asserts that X causes Y if and only if (i) X and Y are causally connected, (ii) everything causally connected to X is causally connected to Y, and (iii) something is causally connected to Y, but not to X. Three arguments are made in defense of this truth condition: (1) it follows from weaker and more evident assertions; (2) it enables one to explain the plausibility of previous accounts of causal priority; and (3) it makes causal asymmetry objective, real, and testable.

BRUECKNER</page><page sequence="22">176 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 34, No. 134, January 1984 Conjectural Realism, RICHARD C. JENNINGS This discussion is a reply to John Worrall's attempt to save realism (according to which scientific theories are true through their correspon dence to "hidden" reality) from the argument from revolutions (that scientific theories of the past have undergone radical changes and so ours are likely to as well). The discussion argues that Worrall's notion of 'conjectural realism', according to which our theories are "true-or false attempted descriptions of reality" (which are likely to give way to future true-or-false attempts) supports little more than a general scep ticism about the truth of scientific theories, and that instrumentalism (against which Worrall is defending realism) is probably the best solution to this problem of scepticism. The discussion concludes by arguing that we should allow ourselves grounds for asserting the truth or likelihood of scientific theories, and that we should give up the metaphysical realist's commitment to an inaccessible "hidden" reality. Mill and the Utility of Liberty, MARK STRASSER Reply to Puccetti, JAMES ROBERT BROWN Brown in Defense of Scientific Realism, ROLAND PUCCETTI Nozick on Scepticism, GRAEME FORBES Dummett and Temporal Operators, J. BUTTERFIELD Vico and Makers Knowledge, PEREZ ZAGORIN Emotion and Imagination, JOHN CASEY THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. 93, No. 2, April 1984 'Ought' Conversationally Implies 'Can', WALTER SINNOTT-ARMSTRONG The author argues against the common assumption that 'ought' entails or (semantically) presupposes 'can' by criticizing three common</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 177 reasons for such claims, presenting a counterexample to such claims, and discounting several responses, including temporal indexing. The author then argues for the weaker, pragmatic claim that 'ought' conver sationally implies 'can' when 'ought' is used for the purpose of advising but not when 'ought' is used for blaming or deliberating. Finally, the author shows how this conclusion undermines common arguments that determinism excludes judgments with 'ought', that moral dilemmas are impossible, and that cultural indoctrination supports moral relativism. Will Power and the Virtues, ROBERT C. ROBERTS The author distinguishes two senses of "will" corresponding to two kinds of virtues, the substantive and motivational virtues (e.g. honesty, compassion, justice), and those of will power (e.g. self-control, courage, patience). The author argues against a number of theorists who assim ilate these kinds of virtues. The virtues of will power have two functions: to correct for counter-moral and counter-prudential inclinations, and to establish the autonomy of the moral agent. These virtues are, for most people in this life, for the most part skill-like capacities. The author addresses a priori arguments in denial of the author's thesis, and sketches a positive account of these virtues as skills. The Adverbial Approach to Visual Experience, MICHAEL TYE According to the adverbial theory, having a visual experience is a matter of sensing in a certain manner rather than sensing a peculiar immaterial object or sense-datum. Although this theory is widely accepted, in the author's view, it has never been satisfactorily worked out. The versions of the adverbial theory which are to be found in the literature are either superficial or open to serious objections. The author's aim in this paper is to investigate the semantic and metaphysical foundations of the adverbial approach. To this end, he distinguishes three different analyses, each of which has some right to be classified as adverbial, and he discusses various problems which they confront. The conclusion the author draws is that there is at least one version of the adverbial theory which is generally defensible. Aristotle's Doctrine of the Material Substrate, SHELDON COHEN Some of Aristotle's interpreters have held that Aristotle is committed to an indeterminate substratum?prime matter?for elemental transfor mation, while others have held that there is no matter in Aristotle more basic than the elements. The author argues for a third position: Aristotle does posit a common material substratum for the four elements, but this common matter of the elements is not the traditionally construed prime mater?i.e., it is not completely indeterminate, but a distinct type of stuff. Second, it has generally been thought that if Aristotle posited a common material substrate for the four elements he did so because he</page><page sequence="24">178 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS held that every change involves a persisting substratum. But, the author argues, Aristotle posited a common matter for the four elements not because his general doctrine of change required it, but because of a specific characteristic he thought he found in elemental transformation. Finally the author sketches out an interpretation of Aristotle that, following a lead in Metaphysics VII, allows us to claim that some changes involve a persisting matter that does not manage to be a persisting substratum for those changes. THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. 93, No. 3, July 1984 The Pseudo-Mates Arguments, TAKASHI YAGISAWA The author argues that Tyler Burge's resurrection of an argument, indicated in Benson Mates's famous passage in "Synonymity," against semantic transparency (salva veritate substitutivity of synonyms) of belief contexts fails to meet Alonzo Church's original challenge to Mates's version. B?rge begs the question in a roundabout fashion. The author suggests a reason why any attempt against semantic transparency of belief contexts is ill-motivated. 1953 And All That. A Tale of Two Sciences, PHILIP KITCHER The author attempts to understand the relationship between classical and molecular genetics, to show that this relationship cannot be under stood in terms of the classical notion of reduction, and to develop a framework within which the significance of molecular studies can be appreciated. The author begins by showing that there are systematic reasons for supposing that classical genetics is not reducible to molecular genetics. The author then offers an analysis of the structure of classical genetic theory, using this to cast light on the most prominent achievements of the tradition initiated in 1953 by the work of Watson and Crick. The author shows how the spirit of the reductionist thesis can be captured within the author's framework, but argues that even "born again" reductionism is doomed to fall short of salvation. Thus the author concludes that the kind of anti-reductionism espoused by many contem porary biologists should not be dismissed as an unintelligible position. Two Faces of Intention, MICHAEL BRATMAN We do things intentionally and we intend to do things. Our com monsense psychology uses the notion of intention to characterize both our actions and our mental states. The author tries to say how these two phenomena are related. On the author's view, intentions are</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 179 distinctive states of mind, reducible neither to desires and beliefs nor to volitions. When I intentionally A I intend to do something (at least in a wide range of cases). But I need not intend to A. The author's explanation of this potential divergence between what is intended and what is done intentionally uncovers two importantly different aspects of intention. Intention is Janus-faced, tied both to coordinating plans and intentional action. This sheds light on the distinction between intended means and merely foreseen upshots. It also clarifies the different ways in which our interest in responsibility, on the one hand, and explanation and prediction, on the other hand, shape our conceptions of intention and intentional action. Hard and Soft Facts, JOSHUA HOFFMAN and GARY ROSENKRANTZ The Ockhamist reply to the alleged incompatibility between divine foreknowledge and human freedom involves a distinction between "hard" and "soft" facts about the past. According to this distinction, hard facts about the past are fixed in a certain sense, but this is not always true of soft facts, and is not true in particular of God's foreknowings (or forebelievings) of present and future human actions. In this paper the authors develop an analysis of the hard fact/soft fact distinction which is correct and which therefore avoids all of the difficulties raised for the distinction in the recent literature. The authors' analysis is based on certain modal and temporal properties of states of affairs, including the technical feature of unrestricted repeatability, present tenseness or tenselessness, and complexity or simplicity. The analysis provided here has further application to the problem of logical determinism posed by the existence of foretruths, and to the problem of explicating the important notion of the sameness of two possible worlds up to a given time. PHILOSOPHY Vol. 59, No. 228, April 1984 The Moral Patient, THOMAS McPHERSON Those moral philosophers who write from the point of view of the moral agent can overlook the significance of the patient; the nature of an action can often not be understood unless the state of mind, etc., of the patient is taken into account. Further, the adoption of the point of view of the patient rather than that of the agent can lead to a change in beliefs about what topics are central in moral philosophy, to different ways of dealing with traditional problems, and to the emergence into a position of importance of new, or at least hitherto relatively neglected, moral problems.</page><page sequence="26">180 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS PHILOSOPHY Vol. 59, No. 229, July 1984 Philosophy as Farce, or Farce as Philosophy, ROY W. PERRETT Tom Stoppard's Jumpers is a play rich in philosophical material. And yet at least two philosophers have denied that it is a work of philosophical significance (Jonathan Bennett, Philosophy 1975; and Hen ning Jensen, Philosophy 1977). The author argues that Jumpers is indeed a philosophically significant play. To this end the author first argues that the appearance-reality theme and its cognate the credibility theme are fundamental to Jumpers by citing relevant speeches and commenting briefly on some of the dramatic situations that reinforce this central theme. Secondly, the author discusses the way in which the farcical quality of much of the action in the play bears upon this central theme. The author maintains that the philosophical content of the play lies in the theatrical dialectic that operates between the "philosophical" speeches and the farcical action. The Ontological Disproof of the Vacuum, C. J. F. WILLIAMS An ancient Eleatic argument concludes that there is no void from the premise that void is nothing and nothing cannot be. Perhaps it involves "the cancelling-out fallacy": since "There is nothing in this flask" and "There is a vacuum in this flask" are equivalent, "nothing" must mean the same as "a vacuum." But "There is a vacuum . . ." cannot, as this would require, be divided into two logically significant parts. Like "There is fog . . . ," which introduces a feature-placing statement and is equivalent to "It is foggy . . . ," "There is a vacuum . . ." could be replaced by an impersonal verb. We could invent a verb "to noth" for this purpose, and with its help express our belief in a vacuum by saying "Somewhere it is nothing." This does not even appear to involve the concept of existence, and thus provides no purchase for an ontological disproof of the vacuum. Systems and Theory in Philosophy, PAUL GILBERT A common comparison between the systematic character of philo sophical views and that of scientific theories is challenged. System in science derives from the use of a model, or systematic metaphor, whose application is justified by its enabling us to look at phenomena in a technically manipulable way. Philosophical metaphors, like literary ones, lead us to see things differently and require imagination to be understood. Two ways of taking the claim that philosophers offer systems are distinguished and criticized: philosophers do not systematise a body of knowledge nor give axiomatic structure to collections of views. It is argued that philosophy is not a systematic study like science which deals with its problems methodically. But, a way in which philosophical</page><page sequence="27">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 181 views may be seen as systematic, though not theoretical, is briefly sketched. Freedom and Capacity to Win, J. T. J. SRZEDNICKI With hindsight we know that Doe had to win the race. Was another free to win it? Accepting determinism we say "free" means not pointless to try, if Doe did not try another would win. Distinguish freedom and capacity. Re the race relevant items were not designed to favour Doe so others should try. To talk about the mechanism of conditions and capacities differs from talk of individuals freedom for that assumes both the state of the world and person, and necessarily. Capacities are neither free nor unfree but great or small. Persons are not free if prevented from exercising capacities. Such restraints are external to them and by other persons. Persons are free if, given conditions and capacities, it is not pointless for them to try. Are those conditions and capacities fairly distributed? Since it makes no sense to ask is the world fair to us? This is no issue. Encounters with Aristotle, MALCOLM SCHOFIELD Eight recent books on Aristotle are critically reviewed: three volumes in the Clarendon Aristotle Series?De Generatione et Corruptione (C. J. F. Williams), Eudemian Ethics (M. J. Woods), and Physics III and IV (E. L. Hussey); three general works?Jonathan Barnes' sparkling short introduction to Aristotle in the Oxford Past Masters Series, Abraham Edel's fat survey Aristotle and his Philosophy, and the final (but perhaps also the freshest) volume of W. K. C. Guthrie's History of Greek Philosophy; and two important studies by Sarah Waterlow?a monograph on Aristotle's modal concepts entitled Passage and Possibility, and a major book on the Physics called Nature, Change and Agency. This latter is a highly original work, full of philosophy and packed with suggestions about Aristotelian interpretation. It probes beneath the text of Aristotle's loosely organised treatise to exhibit?controversially, as the review attempts to show?a deep unitary structure. Mimesis and Abstract Art, GARRY L. HAGBERG Non-representational art initially seems to itself constitute a refu tation of any theory of art based upon mimesis or representation; the very notion of abstract imitative art appears self-contradictory. However, through a reconsideration of Aristotle's meaning in the Poetics of mimesis it becomes evident that these are not strictly incompatible; Aristotle is referring to the representation of the details of circumstances, situations, and movements of the inner life which a simple photographic conception mimesis cannot capture. The resultant more complex notion of artistic imitation is developed through a discussion of works of Chardin, Watteau, and Vlaminck; this complex mimesis can be critically illuminating even in the works of Pollock and Christo.</page><page sequence="28">182 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Suicide and Self-starvation, TERENCE M. O'KEEFFE The article sets out to examine whether death by hunger-strike is properly described as suicide. An account is given of the background of the religious tradition in which suicide is always gravely immoral. The most coherent definition of suicide within this tradition is self-killing where no further objective is intended than ending one's life. Self killings which are instrumental in that the death is used to bring about some other objective are not suicides. Death by hunger-striking thus counts as an instrumental self-killing rather than a suicide. It is suggested that the principle of double effect, invoked by some theologians to establish this by reference to the intention of the hunger-striker, is wrongly interpreted as being about double intentions rather than double effects of actions. Morality and Luck, HENNING JENSEN In this paper the author seeks to provide a solution for the problems which led Thomas Nagel to frame his conception of moral luck and which concern whether our moral assessments may be determined, not just by the tendencies of actions and characters, but by their actual outcome. In doing so, the author shall argue that Nagel's conception of moral luck is based on a mistaken analysis of the relevant issues and should be discarded. The author's account maintains that although actual results beyond the agent's control may determine our blaming expressions, this is to be attributed, not to luck, but to considerations relating to the integrity of persons and their functioning as moral agents. Moral Judgment, Action and Emotion, BERNARD HARRISON Why does morality engage both judgment and feeling? Why do we give moral judgment weight in practical reasoning? The paper argues that appeals to social conditioning or natural sympathy offer inadequate answers to these questions and proposes a solution according to which moral judgment and moral emotion are connected, both conceptually and psychologically, through moral relationship. It is argued that the notion of moral relationship depends logically on that of trust, and that the latter depends logically on the existence of interest-equalizing practices, such as promising or turn-taking, which give content to the notion of wronging someone. Our feelings become involved with morality because of the manner in which the meaning of life becomes dependent upon participation in moral relationship. Judgment enters into morality because relationship and trust are linked conceptually to social practices which give rise to a vocabulary of straightforwardly descriptive concepts.

PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 44, No. 3, March 1984 The Relation of Form and Stuff in Husserl's Grammar of Pure Logic, ROBERT HANNA An essential aspect of Husserl's treatment of formal logic is his endeavor to show both the necessity and complexity of the relation of form and "stuff" (or content) in propositions considered at the most elementary level of pure logic. This Husserl does in appendix 1 of Formal and Transcendental Logic, entitled, "Syntactical Forms and Syntactical Stuffs; Core-Forms and Core-Stuffs." A close analysis of this appendix reveals important contrasts between Husserl's conception of logical syntax and that of the mainstream of modern formal logic since Carnap. Sellars on Kantian Intuitions, MICHAEL WOODS The paper is a discussion of W. Sellars's claim that what Kant speaks of as "intuitions" might well be conceptual in the broader sense so that they turn out to be representations of 'thises'. Whilst there is ambiguity in Kant's use of the term "intuition," the argument that "in certain contexts" intuitions could be said to be conceptual cannot be used to justify the assumption that intuitions can be linguistically specified. The attempt to linguistically specify intuitions rests on the mistaken interpretation that they enjoy a recognizably separate form, or in a form which is "sui generis." PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 44, No. 4, June 1984 Functionalism, Qualia, and the Inverted Spectrum, TERENCE HORGAN Many philosophers believe that functionalism cannot accommodate the qualitative, or phenomenal, aspects of mentality. In support of this claim, they point out that it seems easy to imagine two creatures who are in functionally indistinguishable states but who experience "inverted"</page><page sequence="30">184 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS qualia. The author examines a recent attempt by David Lewis to accommodate inverted qualia within a functionalist conception of men tality and argues that he does not succeed in disarming the inverted spectrum objection to functionalism. The author then proposes a hybrid theory of mind, which combines functionalism regarding nonphenomenal mental states with a type-type psychophysical identity theory regarding phenomenal mental states. Natural Sciences as Textual Interpretation: The Hermeneutics of the Natural Sign, JAMES FRANKLIN The author discusses the parallels between perception, the "inter pretation of sensory experience as representing physical objects," and hermeneutics, the "interpretation of signs as having meaning" (and asserts the two are "radically identical," but this need not be taken literally). Thus perceptual illusions are compared to ambiguities in a text; naive realism about perception to fundamentalism (e.g., about the Bible); phenomenalism to extreme metaphorical interpretation. Good scientific and hermeneutical strategies are also compared: the child's use of repetitions in perception (? la Piaget) to the analysis of unknown languages using repetitions; the scientist's reinterpretation of the "man ifest image" of the world to the global/local interplay in the exegesis of any large and difficult text. The style is somewhat continental, but does not sacrifice readability in English. The ability of English to sustain such abstract discourse at all is treated in a related article (Et cetera 40 (1983): 177-91). Religious Concepts of Punishment and Reward, SHLOMO BIDERMAN and ASA KASHER A framework is established in the introductory part of the paper of conceptual analysis of punishment and reward in religions. The similarity to legal analyses of punishment is stressed but the differences are also indicated. Particular attention is paid to analyses of the concepts of punishment and reward in religion which are minimalistic in the sense of being free of assumptions of a theological nature. A new, minimalistic analysis of religious punishment and reward is proposed. Functionalism and Moral Personhood: One View Considered, DAVID C. WILSON Daniel Dennett has offered a set of necessary and (more or less) sufficient conditions for something's being the proper object of our moral commitment, that is, for something's being a person. Strict application of these largely pragmatic conditions, however, would result in a moral community with quite a surprising membership roster, because of both who is on it and who isn't. The problem isn't really that moral commitment is made dependent on decisions that are nonmoral in nature (Rawls, for one, makes a similar move with a large measure of success); the problem, rather, is that this is implemented in a way such that my</page><page sequence="31">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 185 decision that you are or are not a person tells us much about me (for example, about my goals and my cleverness) and little about you. New Proof for the Physical World, WALTER HORN William James followed Spinoza in claiming that any object of thought that is uncontradicted by some other idea will be believed to be reflective of the world. Bertrand Russell and Peter Geach have also defended this theory that affirmation is logically simpler than doubt or suspension of belief. If this psychological principle is necessarily true, it follows that, necessarily, there are physical objects. For, if there were no physical objects in some possible world w, since the property physicality in w would be represented by anyone who believed that proposition, that person would also have to believe something that entails that there are physical objects in w?something false. But since it is possible that there is someone who believes all and only true physical object proposi tions, there can be no such world as w. Morality, Self-interest, and Reasons for Being Moral, MARK CARL OVERVOLD What should a rational person do when the demands of morality conflict with self-interest? It may be the case that ultimately the rational person must simply choose what he most wants to do, all things considered. The rationality of such a decision consists in the person having a clear and accurate conception of what the alternatives are like. The author argues that the rational choice in this sense is distinguishable from both morality and prudence. The decisive reasons are simply accurate descriptions of what the moral and prudential lives will be like. Such considerations can justify being moral even in cases when doing so is costly for the agent. The paper closes with a consideration of how often and in what circumstances this is likely to be the case. Aristotle's Genealogy of Morals, EUGENE G AR VER PHRONESIS Vol. 29, No. 1 Virtue or Scientific Knowledge: Aspects of "Phronesis" in the "Topics" and "Nichomachean Ethics" of Aristotle, CARLO NATALI In the Topics of Aristotle there is a definite uncertainty about the meaning and nature of phronesis, which appears to be both virtue and</page><page sequence="32">186 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS scientific knowledge. But this presents a problem, since in the Topics virtue and scientific knowledge are two distinct things, in such a way that neither one is contained in the other. This problem finds its solution in the Ethics, where phronesis is not scientific knowledge but another kind of knowledge, while at the same time it remains a virtue, a dianoetic virtue to be more precise: a concept, this latter, that is not found in the Topics. The meaning and nature of phronesis in Nicomachean Ethics VI, 2 must be understood against the background of the aporias of the Topics. Aristotle shows that phronesis is a true form of knowledge directed toward action and is therefore composed of an intellectual element that leads to the discovery of the good, and of an affective element that makes the good desirable. Finally the view is being held that Nichomachean Ethics VI is a unified treatment of various issues and not merely a conglomeration of incoherent texts. Human Imagination and Animal Imagination According to Aristotle, JEAN-LOUIS LARRI?RE This article attempts to give an account of the difference between phantasia aisth?tik?, which belongs to animals, and phantasia logistik?? bouleutik?, which belongs to men, endowed with hypol?psis, doxa, logos. This difference is understood in regard to the difference existing between logos and ph?n?, interpreted itself by the distinction between symbolon and s?meion. Emphasis is laid on the function of phantasia, as the way to research of the practical good. Nature of phantasia seems to give the key of the political supremacy of man. The aim of the paper consists in offering a hierarchy which starts from animals endowed with aisth?sis to animals endowed with phantasia, ako? and ph?n?, through the ones endowed with mn?m?. The top of this hierarchy gives the threshold from where the taking off of man can be appreciated. For man is endowed with phantasia logistik??bouleutik? and hypol?psis, from which derive belief, practical understanding, and knowledge. Who is Aristotle's Citizen?, CURTIS JOHNSON Finding an adequate definition of citizen in the Politics presented Aristotle with several difficulties. Most important among these were, first, the variety of practices of the Greek city-states, and second, the diversity of Greek usage of the term. For a definition must aim at identifying the universal unchanging essence, and it must discover this essence within the actual and existent. What, then, if the actual and existent display nothing but variety and diversity? The definition must be so cast, moreover, as to identify not only who the citizen is, but also who he should be; that is, it must, by virtue of Aristotle's teleology, include a normative dimension. The essay explores Aristotle's attempt to find a definition of citizen which was capable of meeting these difficulties. To solve the problems associated with diversity of usage and practice, Aristotle resorted to a functional definition; certain political</page><page sequence="33">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 187 functions are universal, common to all states, and citizenship is defined in terms of sharing in these. To accomodate the normative requirement, Aristotle invoked the distinction between "the complete citizen," one who deserved to share in offices, and the "incomplete citizen," one who is a citizen in some sense other than the complete sense. Aristotle's Rationalist Account of Qualitative Interaction, ALEXANDER MOURELATOS "If we reason a priori," said Hume, "anything may appear able to produce anything." In De generations et corruptione 1.7 and 1.10 Aristotle, by contrast, argues that effects of qualitative interaction are intelligible a priori Interaction involves (in modern terms) determinates that fall under the same determinable; and the out-come conforms to the principle that F-effects come from F-causes. Effects of mixis, "blending," conform to a certain conceptual calculus. The Harmonia of Bow and Lyre in Heraclitus Fr. 51 (DK), JANE M. SNYDER In Fr. 51 Heraclitus argues that "people do not understand how what is borne in different directions comes to be in agreement with itself; [for] a framework [harmonia] like that of the bow and the lyre turns back on itself [reading palintropos].'9 This is one of the most vexed fragments pertaining to Heraclitus' theory of opposites, for there is much disagreement as to the exact sense of harmonia as well as dispute over which reading?palintropos or palintonos?should be accepted. On the basis of visual evidence from Athenian vase painting, this paper argues that the harmonia of bow or lyre is not an abstract quality, but refers literally to the "fitting together" or "framework" of each object; when viewed from the side, each "turns back on itself" in the sense that its curved structure describes an arc of a circle. Zeno on Knowledge or on Geometry? The Evidence of anon. "In Theaetetum," HAROLD TARRANT RATIO Vol. 26, No. 1, June 1984 On a New Methodological Individualism, J. E. TILES In the third chapter of Semantics and Social Science by Graham Macdonald and Philip Pettit (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1981) Philip</page><page sequence="34">188 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Pettit advances a version of methodological individualism in the social sciences which avoids problems encountered by previous versions of this doctrine. It does so by claiming that we can explain the behavior of members of society (even if we cannot describe that behavior) without referring to institutions. It is argued that either Pettit's position collapses into a form of methodological individualism which he acknowl edges to be unsatisfactory or into a form of methodological collectivism which he claims is distinct from his position. Showing and Telling: Can the difference between right and left be explained in words?, MARTIN CURD Jonathan Bennett ("The Difference between Right and Left," Amer ican Philosophical Quarterly 7 [1970]: 175-191) finds in Kant's writings the thesis that we cannot explain the meanings of "right" and "left" in words alone but must resort to showing. Bennett suggests that this thesis is refuted by messages based on the failure of parity conservation in weak interactions such as beta decay. Curd argues that Kant's thesis is not refuted by such messages since explaining the right/left difference still requires an essential element of showing. The Truth of Statements about Knowledge, and the Propriety of Making Them, JONATHAN HARRISON Sometimes I have to decide whether someone knows something when I already know what he claims to know; at other times I am dependent upon his authority. In the former case I will say that he knows if I am satisfied that he believes for fairly good reasons. In the latter case I will not say he knows unless I am satisfied that his reasons are conclusive. This is because, though what I assert when I say that someone (who may be myself) knows is that he believes upon good evidence, I contextually imply that / myself have conclusive reasons for what I say he knows. Hence I cannot say that someone knows something which I do not already know unless I think his reasons are conclusive, for, since mine will not be if his are not, I will, though asserting what is true, be contextually implying what is false. In Defence of "A New Methodological Individualism": Reply to J. E. Tiles, PHILIP PETTIT This is a defence, in reply to J. E. Tiles, of the individualism for which the author had argued in Graham Macdonald and Philip Pettit Semantics and Social Science, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1981. The individualist claim in question is that nonoblique reference to social entities does not enable us to explain any type or token events which we cannot explain just by reference to people's attitudes and actions. Tiles's objection, adumbrated in Semantics and Social Science, is that we will refer to such entities in giving the contents of people's attitudes or in</page><page sequence="35">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 189 explaining those attitudes. The reply is that such reference will be oblique. This paper argues for this reply and also tries to motivate the nonobliqueness requirement.
