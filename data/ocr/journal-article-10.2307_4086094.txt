<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON SOCIO-ORNITHOLOGY JERRAM L. BROWN' Avian sociobiology has a long and distinguished history, including classic works by Darwin, Altum, Whitman, and Howard, the memorable works of Lorenz, Tin- bergen, and Lack, and more recent studies by Marler, Orians, Crook, Wolf, Pulliam, and many others. Sociobiology is, of course, no more or less than what the name implies; all these authors have participated in it.

If generalizations are to be made about socio- ornithology, they must be judged against the works of these persons as well as against those of persons who identify themselves as sociobiologists. Socio-ornithology is, fortunately, little afflicted with nature-nurture pseudodebates that the science journalists favor. On the other hand, we do have some serious problems. In the study of any animal's social behavior anthropomorphism is a con- stant danger. Anthropomorphism took a drubbing from ethologists in the 1930-50s, who emphasized the "objective study of behavior," but I fear that it is returning under the guise of "selfish genery." Too often the emphasis is on "selfish" and too infrequently on "gene." For example, in 1979 a paper read at the International Ethological Conference seemed to argue for individual selection because the bird "wanted" to be a sentinel. A more difficult problem for socio-ornithologists is their preoccupation with "nat- ural experiments. " Such phenomena are extremely valuable in the exploratory phase of a problem, but they provide no more than correlations. When strong-inference tests (Platt 1964) are needed to separate rival alternative hypotheses, socio-orni- thologists too often are expert at avoiding the necessary controlled experiments. For example, I have met widespread resistance to the idea of controlled experiments in the study of helping behavior in birds (Brown and Brown in press). Some workers in this field seem to be so comfortable with the ambiguities of correlations that the idea of controlled experimentation is quite unsettling. Only in avian sociobiology, it seems, is there such opposition to controlled field experiments. Fortunately, the considerable inertia of status-quo thinking has not prevented some successful applications of the experimental method in avian socio-ecology. Among the success stories are studies on flocking (Caraco et al. 1980), mating systems (Pleszczynskya 1978), and resource defense (Ewald in prep.). A third obstacle for socio-ornithologists is the difficulty of field genetic studies. Despite the reluctance of ornithologists to enter this field, some workers have over- come the status quo and have successfully applied genetic methods to social groups of birds (Baker and Fox 1978, Johnson and Brown 1980). Sociobiology has its problems, but it is a flourishing and exciting branch of biology, as evidenced by the 1980 Dahlem Konferenz on Sociobiology (Markl 1980). Students of avian sociality who remove their blinders and look beyond the confines of avian taxonomic boundaries will undoubtedly make further contributions to sociobiology.
