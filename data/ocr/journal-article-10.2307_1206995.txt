<plain_text><page sequence="1">Isaak August Dorner on Divine Immutability: A Missing Link between Schleiermacher and Barth Robert Sherman / Bangor Theological Seminary Conventional wisdom asserts that Schleiermacher and Barth represent antithetical approaches to theology. From our late twentieth-century van- tage point, however, we recognize that continuity as well as disjunction exists between them. With the translation of Isaak August Dorner's essay, Divine Immutability-a Critical Reconsideration,' Robert R. Williams and Claude Welch enable us to investigate one instance of an evolutionary link between the "Father of Liberal Protestantism" and his most famous critic. Barth stated openly that his treatment of immutability owed much "to Dorner's inspiration."2 Since Dorner had previously acknowledged his own indebtedness to Schleiermacher, it appears that Barth's treatment of divine immutability may be linked to the work of Schleiermacher. In this article, I show that significant continuity does connect all three theolo- gians. However, I also argue that Dorner and Barth develop and modify Schleiermacher's treatment in ways going beyond the latter. To be more specific, Robert Williams has briefly described the relation- ship between Schleiermacher and Dorner and has suggested their cumu- lative influence on Barth. The nature of that influence centers in Dorner's description of divine immutability in ethical rather than metaphysical terms. Williams uses this distinction to indicate that Dorner shifted the focus from God's unchanging being to God's unchanging will. He also uses it to indicate that Dorner did not construe this will as arbitrary, as the mere assertion of a generic omnipotence. Rather, Dorner modified the classical view (in which ethics derives from ontology) to the view that I Isaak August Dorner, Divine Immutability-a Critical Reconsideration, trans. Robert R.

It was assumed that God must be unchangeable in all respects, for any change could only be a change for the worse, calling into question the certainty of salvation. Williams argues that Dorner recognized such an absolute immutability makes implausible any claim of God's real historical relation with creation--especially the personal, loving relation implied in redemption. God must be viewed as constant, as trustworthy and reliable-but not as "unmovable" or static. The key is to stress God's unchanging ethical self-identity, not merely a simple changelessness. Only such a reconceived doctrine of immutability would allow a proper theological description of God's vital, personal rela- tion with creation and the Christian's living relation with God. According to Williams, Dorner therefore revised the traditional doctrine of God in two particular ways.5 First, he redefined divine "simplicity" to allow for necessary immanent distinctions in God and asserted explicitly the pri- macy of love among the divine attributes. Dorner still conceived God's being as a unity, but no longer as an undifferentiated simplicity: love de- termines the metaphysical attributes of being and power. Yet Dorner failed to recognize how much Schleiermacher's work already contained this shift. Williams correctly asserts that Dorner's revision of divine immu- tability depended largely on Schleiermacher's position. Furthermore, as Williams suggests but does not explore, this concept of divine love be- came the common thread running from Schleiermacher to Dorner to Barth.6 One task of this article will be to illustrate and confirm these claims. These distinctions are taken from Williams' introduction, in Williams and Welch, trans., pp. 2-4. 4 Dorner recognized that his reconception of divine immutability was not wholly original but built on insights of the Reformation. Specifically, he acknowledged that the Reformers' new understanding of faith had profound implications for the personhood and relations of God and humans. Dorner contended, however, that the Reformers left these implications undeveloped systematically-and that they were actually hindered in doing so by the Prot- estant emphasis on absolute predistination. As he observed: "It is certain that the Reforma- tion principle contains the seed of a new doctrine of God, but it is equally clear that this seed has not yet yielded its fruit." (See Williams and Welch, trans., pp. 99-100.) One could debate his conclusion on this matter, e.g., with reference to Luther, but such a discussion is beyond the scope of the current examination. 5 Ibid., p. 18. 6 Ibid., p. 19. Williams notes that during his life Dorner was well known inside and out- side Germany, and many of his books were translated into English. Yet this essay has never received much attention from either German- or English-speaking scholars. He cites several 381</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion Second, however, Dorner went beyond Schleiermacher on the other necessary revision of the traditional doctrine of God, that is, "the corol- lary principle that change is essentially mundane and has no basis in God's being or essence."' Williams leaves this issue unaddressed. I con- tend that Dorner-and Barth-present quite different understandings of God's providential/redemptive relation to creation and history than their predecessor. For Schleiermacher, the moment of creation and the structures of the natural order establish the divine-creaturely rela- tion once and for all. Seemingly new things (preeminently redemption through Christ) are not novel or immediate divine interventions but the fruition of seeds planted in the natural order by God at creation. In other words, a certain fatedness exists, originally determined by the divine love but actually precluding God's directly doing any new thing. This stance led Schleiermacher to discard certain traditional notions-for instance, those regarding miracles and God's responsiveness to prayer. For Dorner and Barth, however, freedom characterizes the relation of God and cre- ation. God can act in, and respond to, the course of creaturely affairs. Conversely, God also allows the creaturely realm at times to "set the divine agenda." In sum, the divine course may be construed as alterable even while the divine will remains immutable. Illustrating and confirming this contrast between Schleiermacher, on the one hand, and Dorner and Barth, on the other, will be my second task. THE MOTIVATION FOR DORNER'S ESSAY If we place ourselves in Dorner's context, we note that the immedi- ate occasion for his essay is the kenotic christological debate of the mid- nineteenth century. But he is motivated by more than just the desire to have his say in a dispute among theologians. A broader pastoral concern prompts him as well. Dorner believes his age suffers a spirit of "dis-ease" similar to the one felt by the ancient Greeks. "Even in its heyday," Dorner observes, Greek culture "had the uneasy consciousness that it had at- German histories of Protestant theology (including Barth's) that do not even acknowledge its existence and the most recent German study of Dorner that mentions but does not ana- lyze it. On this side of the Atlantic, Claude Welch was the first-and until the current trans- lation, the only-scholar to follow up Barth's glowing appraisal of the essay in Church Dog- matics II/1. Welch translated the essay's third part (originally included in his God and Incarnation [New York: Oxford University Press, 1965], pp. 115-80) and discussed it briefly (in his Protestant Thought in the 19th Century [New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1972], 1:273-82. See Welch and Williams, trans., pp. 1-2). My own work in this present article arises from conversations with Robert Williams. He made me aware of the probability of a historical-theological connection running from Schleiermacher to Dorner to Barth and indicated that no one had examined and explained it in detail (see Welch and Williams, trans., pp. 4-5). 7 Williams and Welch, trans., p. 18. 382</page><page sequence="4">Dorner on Divine Immutability tained its possessions and riches illegitimately, namely, through a theft from the Gods, or, at least at their expense. This is the meaning of the Prometheus legend." In his day, too, a sense of human self-assertion and accomplishment is accompanied by a feeling of "unfreedom," "disquiet" and "alienation from the divine." To be sure, Dorner assumes the cul- tured do long for a faith as sure and solid as that of their Christian fore- bears. Unfortunately, the theological options available appear either un- inspiring or inadequate. Deism does not offend the assumptions of the age, but it is spiritually banal; a more naive Christian faith is vital but affronts the educated as childish. The sophisticated are left with only a "modern translation of the Prometheus legend into German," namely, the Faustian option. They gain mastery over the material world at the price of their souls.8 Yet Dorner will not surrender the cultured to the reigning ethos. He has no pretensions he can solve the problem single- handedly, but he intends to help in one area that needs it: the doctrine of God. Specifically, he will seek to rejuvenate and relate two types of traditional affirmation about God. One type describes God as infinite, eternal, transcendent-in a word, immutable. Another type speaks of God as personal, immanent, interacting with creation-in a word, living. Each type has deep roots in Christian tradition, yet academic and lay theology both view them as mutually exclusive. It appears that one must either emphasize the immutability of God to the exclusion of the divine vitality (e.g., the tradition as it had developed), or stress the vitality of God to the exclusion of divine immutability (e.g., the Kenoticists and much popular piety). Dorner's doctrine will seek to conceive God as both suprahistorically distinct from creation and historically involved with it. Dorner also insists Christian belief actually requires these two dialec- tical elements be combined. He bases this claim in part on the description of God found in Exod. 3:14, which passage represents a great step for- ward in the progress of piety: God appears as a living person, but also as the unconditional self-identical being that is free from contradictions. "I am who I am" signifies that this absolute being is who he is and always has been, without beginning. But it also implies that he will remain what he is, and therefore will never change or cease to be what and 8 Ibid., pp. 39-41. Consider Dorner's comments: "There is something titanic in our age: something titanically audacious, but also titanically unhappy and restless. The traditional belief in God is severely shaken, the concept of the living God has become vapor and smoke, or terrifying like a ghost. Since the human being cannot live without a god, there arise diverse forms of deification of the world: pseudo-religions that seek to fill the void left by a dying faith with superstitious projections such as deifications of matter, human nature, or works of human culture-statesmanship, art and science" (Williams and Welch, trans., p. 41). The cultural analysis and rhetorical tone evident in this passage suggest one of the attractions Barth found in Dorner. 383</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Religion who he is.... He is the being that is absolutely steadfast, and personal.... And this 'in itselfness,' i.e., having self and asserting self in eternal self-identity and immutability is the immediate presupposition of conceiving God as truly and genuinely ethical or holy. Divine righteousness or justice is nothing other than immutability of God elevated to ethical significance.9 Dorner uses this biblical image of divine immutability to evaluate the doctrine's progress from the close of the canon to his own day. He claims the church came to assume the immutability of God as "an unassailable dogma," and gave it "a privileged, one-sided development." True, certain early theologians "desired to leave open the possibility of a process or even change in God" because they believed the proper delineation of the doctrines of the Trinity, creation and/or incarnation required it. But such views were eventually suppressed as "a pagan corruption." Dorner re- sponds by asking "whether the tradition did not go too far, whether it did not come too close to the Jewish conception of God for which the incarna- tion of God is an offense, and thereby emptied the basic Christian fact of all significance." He argues that the concept of God in classical christology has reached the point--particularly in the Scholasticism of Peter Lom- bard and Thomas Aquinas-of "asserting that all change in the person of Christ falls on its human side, but that the incarnation involves no change in God (Nihilianism). This has the consequence of making the basic Christian fact into something merely subjective."'1 Dorner rejects such a result. Before offering his revision, however, he outlines the histor- ical development of the traditional doctrine. DORNER'S ANALYSIS OF SCHLEIERMACHER Dorner presents a lengthy chronological survey and discussion of relevant passages from a host of theologians. He starts with Augustine and con- cludes with Schleiermacher, who, to his mind, epitomizes all the problems of the traditional view. He finds it ironic that, given the current opposi- tion to Schleiermacher's doctrine of God, critics do not recognize that Schleiermacher has simply translated the stance of Augustine, Dionysius, Anselm, and Quenstedt into contemporary language. Yet such opposition should indicate just how unsatisfactory the traditional view is. Schleier- macher so clearly delineates the shortcomings of the traditional doctrine that Dorner considers him at length, to serve as the negative resource for a reconstructed doctrine." Dorner begins his study of Schleiermacher's understanding of God and 9 Ibid., pp. 85-86. 10 Ibid., pp. 89-90. " Ibid., p. 120. 384</page><page sequence="6">Dorner on Divine Immutability divine immutability by examining the method of The Christian Faith. He summarizes that method as "forming a dogmatics out of a phenomen- ological description of Christian religious consciousness." He then notes the extent to which, given piety's tendency to anthropomorphism, Schleiermacher "seeks to safeguard against the anthropopathic and an- thropomorphic representations of God that contribute impurities to rel- igious consciousness as a result of pagan or pantheistic influences."'2 Dorner concludes that, in seeking to avoid any suggestion of anthropo- morphism, Schleiermacher has gone to the other extreme of construing God as a nonpersonal entity or power. Dorner continues his critique by examining a number of selections from the Glaubenslehre. He summarizes Schleiermacher's general claim that "the consciousness of absolute dependence can be directed at no particular form [Gestalt] in space and time." Such particulars will always involve the give-and-take of finite existence and thus cannot be the proper object of religious feeling. If they are so viewed, then one has fallen into fetishism, confusing God with the world. Neither should one view God as the unity of all the world's particulars. The world is, of course, one. But its unity is not a simple one; rather, it displays diversity, distinction, and even opposition. "In contrast, God is the unity that ex- cludes all contrasts, for to God everything is equally related and in the same sense, namely, as absolutely dependent upon his single creative cau- sality." Moreover, God is "dependent upon" or "conditioned by" nothing, utterly beyond time and space, eternal in "his simple self-sameness and self-identity." Dorner observes that "Schleiermacher conceives God as the self-conceiving concept that is eternally and absolutely transparent to itself." Still, Dorner notes, "he shies away from calling God per- sonal"13-a hesitation Dorner strongly critiques later. Given these initial assertions, Dorner contends, it comes as no surprise that Schleiermacher then treats the divine attributes as he does. There can be no objective distinction or plurality among them. Dorner summa- rizes his predecessor by stating: Schleiermacher conceives God to be simple self-sameness and self-identical, with- out opposition. In this simplicity no real distinction between attributes, no dis- tinction between knowledge and will, nor between will and ability are supposed to remain. There is nothing potential in God that does not become eternally actual. Consequently, there cannot be a plurality of different divine decrees or functions and actions, whether or not one wants to construct divine attributes. There can- not first be something, then something other-be it thought, will, or creative causality. God rather comprehends everything eternally and indivisibly with one 12 Ibid., pp. 120-21. 's Ibid., pp. 121-22. 385</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion and the same immutable thought. And this thought is not a moment without the will, or a will without efficaciousness.'4 Those familiar with secs. 50-56 of the Glaubenlehre will recognize that this summary fairly represents Schleiermacher's understanding of the divine attributes there presented. Dorner's question then becomes: what does this imply about God's relation to the world and history? Schleiermacher's position can only be that "the world exhausts the actual." True, certain natural causes may be latent and not produce their effects immediately. "But God adds nothing new to the actualization of the origin. On God's side everything is willed and effected in an eternal manner. Differences in appearance are due solely to the fact that their conditions are not yet present in the vital causal nexus of the world."'5 Yet if this is the case, then historical existence must be illusory. There can be no real openness to action or change in the cosmos. "The world no longer consists of a serious, important history of becoming and cre- ation, an actualization of the ideal enriched by opposition and struggle, ... [it] is merely a dogmatic repetition and rehearsal of something al- ready eternally accomplished."'16 By extension, any spatial or objective distinctions must also be considered illusory. In sum, Dorner concludes, Schleiermacher's claim that God excludes all distinctions inevitably re- sults in acosmism.'7 Yet Dorner knows Schleiermacher did not intend this outcome. He ac- cepts Schleiermacher's insistence that Christ's appearance in history is a new thing. He also accepts Schleiermacher's insistence that the Christian's new life not be construed in Pelagian terms, but in terms of grace: we understand it '"not as our own act, but ascribe it to a special divine com- munication' (G1. ?80)."18 Why is this distinction so important? Because Dorner asserts that a Pelagian construal of redemption leads necessarily to a particular construal of divine causality. According to that view, salva- tion becomes an essentially human accomplishment, grounded in God- given capacities inherent, if previously dormant, in human nature. Christ is not distinct from humanity; he simply exemplifies its full potential. Thus, God does not effect redemption by a new act, nor is there any distinction in God's causal relation to humanity and creation prior to and following the appearance of Christ. Rather, divine causality undergirds 14 Ibid., p. 124. 15 Ibid., pp. 124-25. 16 Ibid., p. 125. 17 Williams defines this term as follows: "Acosmism denies independent reality to the world or to certain cosmological features, e.g., plurality. Since the world has no reality inde- pendent of God, the reality of the world is identified with God, thus resulting in pantheism rather than panentheism." See Williams and Welch, trans. (n. 1 above), p. 95, n.30. 18 Ibid., p. 128. 386</page><page sequence="8">Dorner on Divine Immutability the emerging God-consciousness in precisely the same way, and in seam- less continuity with, the original God-consciousness. In other words, ac- cording to Dorner, conceiving salvation along Pelagian lines inevitably results in the traditional doctrine of divine immutability. More critically, the reverse holds as well: if one starts with the traditional understanding of divine immutability, one inevitably ends with a Pelagian position on redemption. To avoid this outcome, one must posit a differentiation in God's activity in Christ and, ultimately, in God's very being-which Schleiermacher finally does. As Dorner observes: "We find that when Schleiermacher allows the Christian consciousness to express itself freely, he himself comes back to a distinction in the divine causality, without which there could be no distinction between the redeemer and the re- deemed." 9 To Dorner, Schleiermacher's Glaubenslehre concludes where it should- but not where one would have expected, based on his treatment of the divine attributes in the First Part. Schleiermacher falls short, not because he was wrong, but because he failed to use the perspectives in the Second Part to correct the traditional view of immutability in the First Part. In that First Part, Schleiermacher describes divine causality as a generic om- nipotence, which allows "nothing specific of God's being to be known from its effects."20 In the Second Part, however, "this entire position is reversed when Schleiermacher speaks of the realm of grace. For here we have not merely an act that allows no secure inference to the essence of its author, rather we have an 'action of God' motivated by love."21 Clearly, the divine attributes do not share equal rank in the being of God, nor are they essentially neutral. Rather, divine love holds primacy, and it alone can be equated with God's essence. That is, divine love determines and directs all that God is and all that God does. Yet if this is so, then what should we make of Schleiermacher's initial descriptions of the divine attri- butes which portray them as an undifferentiated, simple unity? Dorner's answer: Schleiermacher simply failed to work through his own best in- sight. Is Dorner's analysis accurate? Yes and no, on two different counts. On the first count, he correctly recognizes that in Schleiermacher's view, di- vine love has priority among the other attributes and thus determines and orients them. But Dorner then makes the mistake made by other Schleiermacher interpreters: he fails to recognize the organic connection between the First and Second Parts of the Glaubenslehre. He suggests that Schleiermacher intended the description of divine attributes in the First L9 Ibid., p. 129. 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid.; emphasis mine. 387</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion Part to stand on its own, as complete in both form and content. It should not be so viewed. As described in the First Part, the divine attributes dis- play an abstracted and neutral form, only actually completed when com- bined with the propositions in the Second Part. Schleiermacher's por- trayal of the divine attributes and their relative relations are therefore not inconsistent, merely unspecified. Had Schleiermacher actually reversed the order of the First and Second Parts in his second edition of the Glaub- enslehre-as he said in his letters to Dr. LUicke22 he could have done-then the way God's love determines and specifies the other divine attributes would have become apparent. Even without such a reversal, Schleier- macher still put the point plainly in The Christian Faith, sec. 164.1: "The world of nature is not to be considered as going its own way on the strength of the divine preservation, the divine government only exerting influence on it through special isolated acts, so as to bring it into harmony with the kingdom of grace. To us, rather, the two things are absolutely one, and we have the certainty that from the beginning the whole disposition of nature would have been different had it not been that, after sin, redemption through Christ was determined on for the human race."23 Clearly this does not reflect a de- tached or neutral conception of divine immutability. It presents a picture of a loving God creating and directing the world and its course in a very particular way to a very particular end. On the second count, as Dorner points out, Schleiermacher does in- deed characterize Christ as a new thing in human history and rejects any Pelagian construals of redemption. Nevertheless, the incarnation and redemption are not a new act on the part of God. They do not represent a response to, or historical interaction with, the created order. Rather, Schleiermacher still conceives them as "implanted" in creation from the beginning. But they are not therefore simply a part of the natural order, arising as the result of mundane cause-and-effect. Instead, they appear according to the predetermination of the eternal decree, as directly de- pendent on God as the first creation. Indeed, they consummate that cre- ation, insofar as human being is concerned. Thus, Christ does not merely exemplify a capacity inherent in human nature (the Pelagian view). In- stead, Christ is the "new Adam," the first human being for whom redemp- tion is even a possibility. As such, he becomes the unique source of re- demption for all who follow. 22 Friedrich Schleiermacher, On the "Glaubenslehre": Two Letters to Dr. Licke, trans.

To begin with, the latter clearly inherits Schleiermacher's understanding of divine love directing the other attributes. God's simplicity can no longer be understood as an undifferentiated unity; instead, it must be viewed as a unity involving distinctions. This shift is crucial for Dorner. He certainly presupposes the primacy of the ethical over the metaphysical. But he also takes this shift to imply something about God's "relationality." How he develops this notion is what moves him distinctly beyond Schleier- macher. Dorner understands his tasks as being critical and constructive. He be- gins by asking "at what points, in the interests of vitality [Lebendigkeit] in the concept of God, a change in the doctrine of the old ecclesiastical dogmatics is required by scientific thought [Wissenschaft] and religion." Once this critical task is accomplished, Dorner will then present "in a positive dogmatic way" that "higher principle" by which God's immutabil- ity and vitality can be united, so that one can correctly determine "the relation of... God's transcendence to his immanence in the world."24 To perform the critical task, Dorner takes a wide-open approach to topics and sources, and his method reflects this. For example, he uses the above-mentioned "relationality of God" to address the "interests of vital- ity" regarding, among other things: God's intra-Trinitarian nature; God's relation to creation as such; God's relation to the world's changeability; God's omnipotence, especially in relation to free creatures; divine omni- science in relation to creaturely knowledge; divine eternity and divine omnipresence. Matters become even more complex when he suggests that doctrinal changes may be necessitated by either "science" or "religion." By "science," he means that the doctrine must show rational, disciplined consistency and a compatibility with the general intellectual assumptions of his time. By "religion," he means the doctrine will be shaped by appeals to traditional orthodoxies, warnings to avoid certain heretical paths, and (in a manner more like Barth than Schleiermacher) appeals to Scripture. As a result, his meandering exposition often obscures what he has to say. Whatever source or norm he cites in a given instance-and frequently it is more than one-his method seems rather ad hoc. Despite this methodological mixture, Dorner's reconception of God's vitality is quite intriguing. To illustrate, I will consider in particular his understanding of God's omnipotence in relation to free creatures. The influence of "science" can be seen in his appeal to a general sensibility 24 Williams and Welch, trans., pp. 130-31. 389</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion about the historicity of human existence and the advent of the new. The influence of "religion" shows in his citations from various Scriptural pas- sages and his appeal to avoid Pelagianism. Dorner posits two possible op- tions: Either the effective action of God for the production of novelty in the world must be denied, and the actual emergence of this novelty be traced simply to the pro- ductive natural order which God has created once and for all complete and self- sufficient: or else, if one acknowledges that God has also immediate and not merely deistic relation to the actual emergence of the new, then it must be recog- nized that the efficacious, i.e. properly creative, activity of God (to be sure, in unity with the order of the divine decree) proceeds temporally and conditions itself in its action by what is spatially and temporally already given.25 Dorner clearly understands Schleiermacher to have followed the first op- tion; he, by contrast, chooses the second. Yet Dorner does not construe the divine activity simplistically as super- natural interruptions into the natural order. Rather, he cites the scrip- tural passages of Acts 17:28, "In him we live and move and have our being," and 2 Cor. 6:16, "I will live in them and move among them," and interprets these to mean that God participates in the human and that human beings, in their free and various actions, may "act for God." To those who would object that this view must either diminish God's power and sovereignty or restrict human freedom, Dorner replies that the oppo- site holds true in both cases. If the highest created causes are those that are free, "destined to posit themselves ethically and to act freely," then the highest, most beneficient power must be that which chooses to create and interact with these beings on such an interpersonal basis. God does not relate to human beings in the manner of an irresistable force or law. God of course grounds all human being-and demonstrates a magnani- mous power in doing so. But unless individuals consciously embrace this fact, they cannot attain the full potential for which they were created, they cannot will and know themselves "to be what they are recognized [erkannt] by God to be, i.e. what is God's eternal idea of them." (Notice how this position seems to stand half way between Schleiermacher's no- tion of "God-consciousness" and Barth's ontic/noetic, de jure/de facto dis- tinction between non-Christians and Christians.) Conversely, without this consciousness, God's causality cannot reach its fullest possibilities, either. In sum, "without participation in God, man cannot attain the concept which God formed of him, and without the developed, actualized recep- tivity of men for God, God cannot dwell and move in men."26 25 Ibid., p. 143. 26 Ibid., pp. 144-45. 390</page><page sequence="12">Dorner on Divine Immutability This stance has clear implications for the traditional view of divine im- mutability. Dorner not only accepts but encourages them: Thus it is undeniable that God, so far as he dwells in man, also leads an historical life in the world, enters into contact with time; and his life achieves an ever greater extension, not from itself in the manner of a natural process but by continuing deeds, which are always proportioned and conditioned according to receptivity. The act of God is not to be conceived as something absolutely simple, remaining eternally self-identical, working as it were as constant pressure, to which the di- verse results accrue only through the diverse conditions of the world-for that would lead back to the Pelagian thesis. Rather God changes the world, since he works upon it diversely, though to be sure incessantly corresponding to the recep- tivity present. But in his giving of participation in himself he enters into temporal- ity and the distinctions of the world.27 What Dorner describes is a transfer of divine power to human freedom and agency. As he later phrases it, "on the foundation of nature God wills a second world to exist, the free world of love in a family of God."28 With this description, Dorner understands God as participating in the world in ways traditional views could not conceive. However, does Dorner's claim actually maintain the dialectical balance between divine immutability and vitality? What "higher principle"29 could hold the two poles together? This matter goes to the heart of his constructive project. Now he makes the questions, and his response, ex- plicit. On the one hand, what is the nature or center of the immutability ascribed to God, which serves as the norm and source of the alterations reflected back into God from the world? On the other hand, what is the center and essence of the divine vitality?30 Can these "centers" be one and the same? Yes, but only if they are construed not in his being [Sein] and life as such-for these categories, which in themselves are still physical, lead us forever to deism or pantheism in restless interplay-but in his ethical being [Wesen = "essence"]. By this there is given in God himself the true copula of eternal rest and movement, of immutable self-identity and most intensive vitality. In this we have both the supreme and immovable norm for the eternally steadfast and constant, and the principle for that sort of change which can be reflected into God's spiritual life; no less therefore do we have the principle generally for the relation between God's super-historical and historical life.3' Here is the distinction Robert Williams discerned when he describes Dorner's position as shifting from a metaphysical to an ethical immutabil- 27 Ibid.; emphasis mine. 28 Ibid., p. 148. 29 Ibid., p. 131. 30 Ibid., p. 165. 31 Ibid. 391</page><page sequence="13">The Journal of Religion ity. It focuses not on a changeless being and act, generically understood, but on an ethical and personal orientation that remains eternally self- identical even as its historical forms may alter to accommodate mutable human existence. But what might this mean, in more specifically Christian terms? Dor- ner recognizes that here prevailing sentiment would likely appeal to the "axiom that God is love."32 He concurs with the move but insists that it does not derive merely from subjective feeling. Rather, it is grounded in a fundamental and objective reality in God, which requires "closer scien- tific treatment." This he does by using as his starting point Plato's familiar question, whether the good is good because God wills it, or whether God wills it because it is good. Dorner finds these alternatives inadequate. On the one hand, the mere act of the divine willing cannot be what makes the good good; this makes God's omnipotence primary and goodness sec- ondary, a creation rather than an innate attribute of God. On the other hand, the good does not exist as some sort of law above God; this, too, would make it external, not intrinsic to God. So the good must be in some manner innate to God. But it cannot be construed simply as God's "natural" goodness, a property of the divine being. In this case, it would not be ethical goodness, the product of a willed and free action. Dorner therefore offers a third answer to the question, bringing the two alterna- tives together in a dialectical and Trinitarian manner. The ethical exists in the Godhead not as an immediate absolute actuality, but only as "an eternal self-actualization of God as good through his will." In other words, divine goodness cannot be a homogeneous unity or a static hierar- chy, but must exist in "a multiple and yet inwardly coherent mode." In this multiple mode Dorner recognizes the Trinity. "God is to be conceived first as the ethically necessary being or as the holy, second as the ethically free; [third] through both of these, God actualizes himself eternally as self- conscious, holy and free love." The first of these modes Dorner identifies with God the Father, the second with the Son, and the unifying third with the Holy Spirit.33 Thus, Dorner does finally affirm the axiom that "God is love" because it defines the proper position and purpose of all other aspects of God's being. "In a word, all the divine powers and attributes do not in the last analysis exist for themselves, as if they were for themselves absolutely val- uable and necessary; they exist for absolute love."34 In this way, Dorner arrives at the same conclusion Schleiermacher had reached earlier: love grounds and motivates God's causality, it enacts God's redemptive work 32 Ibid., p. 166. 33 Ibid., pp. 161, 169-73. 34 Ibid., pp. 175-76. 392</page><page sequence="14">Dorner on Divine Immutability in Christ. Indeed, this redemptive work is not one example of divine cau- sality among others in the world; rather, it determines that causality throughout. Dorner did not fully recognize his similarity to Schleier- macher here, but his rethinking of divine immutability certainly repeats Schleiermacher's fundamental claim of the primacy of divine love. Still, the way Dorner construes this love as informing the divine vitality goes creatively beyond Schleiermacher's "deistic" understanding. Dorn- er's position appears to stem from a shift in pious, even aesthetic sensibil- ity. Clearly, the image of God as undiluted simplicity, divine causality as undifferentiated, and divine immutability as a detached transcendence hold no appeal for him. Rather, he fosters a view of God as motivated by love, of divine causality as something not only copious but diverse, and of divine immutability as dealing primarily with God's original and final purposes for, and in relation with, humanity. Dorner's God is not averse to bestowing power to the creative agency of humans; to the contrary, their divinely ordained development as free and ethical beings requires it. Even more, such a conferral itself illustrates the self-giving purity of the divine love. BARTH'S DISCOVERY AND USE OF DORNER As we now turn to a consideration of the influence of Dorner's essay on Barth, the initial question arises: where and when did Barth first encoun- ter it? Dorner wrote the essay in G6ttingen, between 1856 and 1858, and its three parts became some of the first articles contained in hisJfahrbiicher. Did Barth become familiar with the essay during his own time at G6t- tingen (October 1921 through July 1925)? Evidently not: his dogmatics during this period show no influence of Dorner. Another possible date for Barth's "discovery" of Dorner's essay might be sometime in 1927, when he published the first and only volume of his Christian Dogmatics. According to Eberhard Busch's biographical book on Barth, "these Dogmatics shared with Romans a 'protest against modern Protestantism,"' a protest "given outward form by the frequent quotation of theologians who had 'not walked on the main road of more recent theology,"' among them Dor- ner.35 However, Barth included Dorner for reasons other than his views on immutability, as indicated by the fact that he had still made no com- ments on this aspect of Dorner's thought in his 1932-33 lectures at Bonn on Protestant theology in the nineteenth century.36 Thus, based on the 35 Eberhard Busch, Karl Barth-His Life from Letters and Autobiographical Texts, trans. John Bowden (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1976), p. 173. 36 These lectures became his book of the same name. See Karl Barth, Protestant Theology in the Nineteenth Century [no translator given] (n.p.: SCM Press, 1959, 1972; reprint, Valley Forge, Pa.: Judson Press, 1973), pp. 577-87. 393</page><page sequence="15">The Journal of Religion evidence available to me, I conclude that Barth finally came across the essay no later than 1939, as he prepared Church Dogmatics II/1, published in the summer of that year. Given Barth's discovery of the essay and his acknowledgment of its "in- spiration," the next question becomes: how much did he rely on Dorner, and how much, if any, did he move beyond him? The answer is that, in places, Barth used Dorner directly and extensively. In other places, however, Barth's obvious similarities to Dorner represent a convergence rather than dependence. Indeed, in some instances, Barth clearly went creatively beyond the stance staked out by Dorner. To exemplify Barth's most direct use, consider how closely he echoed Dorner in these two sets of parallel excerpts summarizing their respective understandings of immutability defined in "ethical" terms, that is, in terms of the Scriptural assertion that "God is love." I have put Dorner's excerpt first and Barth's second, and marked in italics the terms, phrases, and constructions displaying the most similarity. The first set reads: So 13t der ethische Gottesbegriff Raum fiir die Lebendigkeit und Bewegung in Gott, ja er gestattet wohl, daB auch Wandel und Anderung sich in Gott hinein reflectire (was freilich immer wieder erst ethisch motivirt sein muB), wenn nur Eines bewahrt bleibt, die ethische Sichselbstgleichheit und Unverdnderlichkeit Gottes. Diese muB unverletzt bleiben; sie mufi auch nach dem Obigen ewige Actualitat in Gott sein, kann in Gott selbst nicht irgendwann blopfe oder auch nur theilweise Potenziali- tilt sein; die innere pers6nliche Wirklichkeit des Ethischen, die Gott selbst ist, kann kein intermittirendes, sondern nur ein stetiges, sich selbst gleiches Dasein haben. Gott kann in sich nie blofie Potenz der Liebe sein. [Dorner]37 Aber dem ist eben nicht so, daB das Unveranderliche als solches Gott wire. Sondern-und das ist etwas anderes-Gott ist &lt;unverdnderlich&amp;: er der Lebendige, er in seiner Freiheit und Liebe, er selbst. Er ist in ewiger Aktualitdit, nie blopf potentiell (nie 37 Isaak August Dorner, "Ueber die richtige Fassung des dogmatischen Begriffs der Un- vertindlichkeit Gottes," Gesammelte Schriften aus der Gebiet der systematischen Theologie (Berlin: Verlag von Wilhelm Herz, 1883), p. 352. Hereafter referred to as Dorner. Compare the English translation from Welch and Williams, trans. (n. 1 above), p. 176 (I have made minor revisions to reflect the German more literally): Thus the ethical concept of God leaves room for "livingness" and movement in God-yes, it may well permit even change and alteration to be reflected into God (to be sure, this must always be ethically motivated), if only one thing continues to be preserved, the ethical self- identity and immutability of God. This must remain inviolate; according to the argument above, it must also be eternal actuality in God, it cannot in God himself be at any time merely or even partial potentiality; the inner personal reality of the ethical, which is God himself can have no intermittent existence, but only one which is constant and self-identical. God in himself can never be mere potence of love. 394</page><page sequence="16">Dorner on Divine Immutability auch nur teilweise blof potentiell!) nie und nirgends intermittierend, immer und iiberall stetig und sich selbst gleich, was er ist. [Barth]38 Consider next the second set of passages, excerpted just a little further on in their respective treatments: Statt dessen ist der Gott des Alten und des Neuen Testamentes nicht ohne ewige Selbstbehauptung seines ethischen Wesens, nicht ohne Gerectigkeit, die das absolut Wert- volle als solches behandelt und behtitet. Selbstbehauptung oder selbstliebe ist nicht Ego- ismus, sondern sie muB auch der Selbsthingabe oder Selbstmittheilung immanent sein und bleiben, und dieses Negative ist fuir den ethischen Character der Letz- tern entscheidend. Diese gerechte Selbstbehauptung in ihrer unbedingten Nothwendigkeit gehiirt zur Ehre Gottes. [Dorner]39 Was er Kraft seiner Freiheit um seiner Liebe willen tut, das wird nie die Preis- gabe, sondern als solches immer und iiberall die neue Selbstbehauptung seiner Freiheit und seiner Liebe, ein neuer Erweis seines Lebens sein. Und es wird dieses seine Selbstbehauptung nie und nirgends der Akt eines heiligen Egoismus, sondern immer und fiberall der Akt seiner Gerectigkeit sein, in der er seine Ehre iiber Alles setzt und schon als Akt seiner Gerechtigkeit mufi seine Selbstbehauptung als notwendig, als keinem Zweifel und keiner Anfechtung unterliegend verstanden werden. [Barth]40 Dorner followed the above affirmations with descriptions of the pri- macy of the relation of love within the interpersonal life of the Trinity, and the subsequent impartation of love to "a world of personal beings."41 He then supported his position with a consideration of relevant Scripture passages.42 Barth makes virtually the same moves. True, he does start by considering creation rather than the Trinity. But in fact, just like Dorner, 38 Karl Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, II/1: Die Lehre von Gott (Ziirich: Theologischer Verlag, 1940), p. 556. Hereafter, Barth, KD II/1. Compare with the English translation from CD II/1 (n. 2 above), p. 495 (with revisions to reflect the German more literally): "But it is not true that the immutable as such is God. The real truth is-and it is very different-that God is "immutable," and this is the living God in His freedom and love, God Himself. He is in eternal actuality-never mere potential (never even to some extent mere potential!), never and nowhere intermit- tent-always and everywhere constantly and self-identically what He is." 39 Dorner, p. 353. Compare with the English translation in Welch and Williams, trans., p. 177: "The God of the Old and New Testament is not without eternal self-affirmation of his ethical essence, not withoutjustice, which is concerned with and guards the absolutely valuable as such. Self-affirmation or self-love is not egoism, but it must be and remain immanently self- giving and self-impartation, and this negative is decisive for the ethical character of the latter. This righteous self-affirmation belongs in its unconditional necessity to the honor of God." 40 Barth, KD II/1, p. 556. Compare with the English translation from CD II/1, p. 495: "What He does in virtue of His freedom for the sake of His love will never be the surrender but always at every point the self-affirmation of His freedom and His love, a fresh demonstration of His life. This self-affirmation is never anywhere an act of holy egotism, but always everywhere an act of the righteousness in which He establishes His glory over all things. And as an act of His righteousness, His self-affirmation must be understood as necessary, not subject to any doubt or temptation." 41 Williams and Welch, trans., pp. 177-78. 42 Ibid., pp. 178 ff. 395</page><page sequence="17">The Journal of Religion he understands the relationality within the Trinity as having priority over the relation of God to the world. Indeed, Barth explicitly asserts that the diversity in God's own Trinitarian being could have sufficed as a realm of self-impartation. Hence, creation is in no way necessary to God's self- fulfillment. He states this more boldly than Dorner, who occasionally leaves the impression that God needs creation for divine self-fulfillment. For example, Dorner's statement that creaturely causality does not limit but actually extends God's omnipotence implies that divine power re- quires creation for its full realization. Barth also inserts an excursus on supporting biblical passages more extensive than anything in Dorner. Yet Barth cites many of the same pas- sages found in his predecessor and interprets them in similar fashion. For example, they both make virtually the same point about God's vital connection with humanity and history from the divine name,43 they both cite the phrase "king of the ages" from 1 Tim. 1:17 and explain it to mean that God is active not just above, but within the stream of time,44 and they both cite Ps. 18:25 ff. to support the view that God's immutability also exhibits a kind of "pliability" (Biegsamkeit, Dorner's term) or "elasticity" (Elastizitdt, Barth's word).45 And finally, Barth also stakes out much the same position as Dorner in regard to prayer. Both repudiate the sense of almost stoic resignation evident in Schleiermacher's views, but neither wants to imply that prayer can manipulate God. In stressing this latter point, Barth echoes Dorner's words almost exactly.46 What should we make of these numerous similarities? With regard to the Scripture citations, one can never fully refute the supposition that anyone with a concordance and a Bible would likely choose many of the same ones. But it also seems reasonable to suppose that Barth adopts several thanks to Dorner's lead. We can also reasonably conclude that Barth adopts the overall logical development, if not its discrete parts and phrases, quite straightforwardly from Dorner.47 43 Compare Williams and Welch, trans., p. 179, with Barth, CD II/1, p. 495. 44 Compare Williams and Welch, trans., p. 179, with Barth, CD II/1, p. 496. 45 Compare Williams and Welch, trans., p. 179, with Barth, CD II/1, p. 496. Other mutu- ally cited passages include Gen. 6:6; Amos 7:3 and 6; Gen. 18; Exod. 32:10 ff.; Joel 2:13; Jon. 4:2; and Jer. 18:8, 10, 26:2, 19, 36:3, and 42:10. 46 Dorner comments, "Zwar nicht die Ziigel des Regimentes iibergibt Gott den Gliubi- gen" (Dorner, p. 373; English translation: "To be sure, God does not hand over the reins of government to the faithful"; Williams and Welch, trans., p. 194), while Barth writes, "Das bedeutet nicht, daB Gott die Ziigel des Weltregiments in die Hinde der Glaubenden legt" (Barth, p 575; English translation: "This does not mean that God puts the reins of world government in the hands of believers" CD II/1, p. 511). 47 It is particularly instructive to compare Barth's very brief treatment of divine immuta- bility in his G6ttingen dogmatics with his far lengthier exposition in the Church Dogmatics. In the former, one can sense that he knew what he wanted to exclude but not what to in- 396</page><page sequence="18">Dorner on Divine Immutability BARTH'S ADDITIONS Of course, this does not mean everything in Barth's doctrine of immuta- bility comes from Dorner. "Motifs"48 and moves characteristic of Barth's work elsewhere appear here as well, and their place in this treatment of divine immutability can be highlighted. His dialectical method appears early and often in his repeated pairings of "opposites." To give one key example, consider the way he connects constancy and freedom49 and states more particularly that God's redemptive act in Christ is certainly a "free decision" while also being "a necessary decree of God."50 His "partic- ularism" appears in his insistence that God's immutability not be defined according to some general concept subsequently applied to God; rather, God's constancy itself defines "immutability."5" (If nothing else, this word change helps highlight the intentional shift from more static metaphysical to ethical, personal categories.) And his "actualism" allows Barth to de- scribe redemption as a new work, while also giving him an alternate lan- guage to that of Deism and "subjectivism."52 Indeed, I see Barth's reference to the freedom and "special act" of God as that point where he builds on, and moves beyond, Dorner's position regarding God's relation to creation. Like Dorner, Barth considers the notion of a divine-human partnership. Dorner understood this as hu- mans "dwelling and moving" in God and-more crucially to his particu- lar position-God dwelling and moving in humans "willing and knowing themselves to be what they are recognized [erkannt] by God to be."53 That is, they become the means whereby God has a vital and historical exis- tence. Dorner believes this move overcomes the "deistic" tendency of Schleiermacher: it portrays God as integrally involved in the novel events of history. Yet it still couches God's ability to do new things in terms of the religious consciousness and ethical freedom and activity of the human subject. Barth, too, describes a partnership and echoes Dorner's argu- ment that this actually speaks for, and not against, God's greater majesty.54 clude. Dorner's work gave him the material for a fuller, more positive exposition of the doctrine. See Karl Barth, The Gittingen Dogmatics-Instruction in the Christian Religion, ed. Hannelotte Reifen, trans. Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerd- mans Publishing Co., 1991), 1:439. 48 I am borrowing the particular names for these motifs from George Hunsinger's book, How to Read Karl Barth (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991). 49 "Because our present task is to view and understand God's freedom, we begin with the fact that He is constant." Barth, CD II/1 (n. 2 above), p. 491. 50 Ibid., p. 518. 51 Ibid., p. 495. 52 Ibid., pp. 506 ff 53 Williams and Welch, trans. (n. 1 above), p. 145. 54 Barth, CD II/1, pp. 507-8. 397</page><page sequence="19">The Journal of Religion However, Barth does not restrict God's historical activity to the human acts effected by religious self-consciousness, as if God could be at most only the motivating member of the divine-human partnership. Recall that Barth's overall formula for this chapter of Church Dogmatics is "the being of God as one who loves in freedom." His doctrine of immutability stands in the immediate context of the divine freedom, which itself stands in the broader context of the divine love-both of which are defined by the particularity of God's Trinitarian and christological character and act. This subordination and interconnection enables Barth to construe God's acts as more than the effects of either the natural causal nexus or self- conscious human "mediation." As he asserts, "God is free to be and oper- ate in the created world either as conditioned or as unconditioned. God is free to perform His work either within the framework of what we call the laws of nature or outside it in the shape of miracle. .... He is free to maintain as God His distance from the creature and equally free to enter into partnership with it."55 Later, in a passage that tells us more about both the natural order and how we should understand human partner- ship with God, Barth observes: When God speaks and acts and is heard and obeyed by men, it is always in the sphere of creation, at some point in the context of life established and preserved by creation. Yet in this very sphere and context it is on each occasion something completely new. Although it follows some other event and many other events, it does not follow from this other event or the sequence of all others. On the con- trary, at the heart of these other events it has the character of a termination of all the rest and at the same time of the beginning of something quite different. God's words and acts, and the faith and obedience with which man meets these (and the unbelief and disobedience with which he withstands them) do take place within the course and development of created things, and have the character of these things. At the same time, however, they have decisively the character of an interruption and annulment of all that precedes in favour of a new order.56 In other words, the typical distinction between ordinary, "natural" and extraordinary "miraculous" occurrences simply disappears. Both types are miraculous, and depend equally on the free and immediate act of the omnipotent God. The usual course of events, and the natural powers driving them, must be viewed in a new way. "In the light of the divine miracle, we can no longer ascribe to the powers an independence and value and truth and validity of their own. In the miracle it is made clear to us that all the kingdoms of this world will be those of God and His Christ, and in fact are this already. Thus there are no autonomous rules 55 Ibid., pp. 314-15. 56 Ibid., p. 509. 398</page><page sequence="20">Dorner on Divine Immutability or laws of a so-called 'regular' course of events."57 None of this means, of course, that God is arbitrary or the natural order unreliable. Yet the lat- ter's stability comes not of its own accord nor by any inherent general law or principle, but only by means of the former's own constant providential reenacting of it. Nature's reliability obtains derivatively from God's living constancy. It exists because in each moment God wills it to exist. Furthermore, God reveals divine power and constancy not first and foremost in the general acts of creation or preservation but in the special, new work of salvation. Barth makes this interpretative schema fundamen- tal by starting with God's freedom and gracious agency and only then speaking of natural freedom and agency, by starting with the specific his- tory of Christ in order to define the possibilities of general history. "It is in and by the knowledge of this second act that we come to know the first. It is in and by the special that we recognise the general, and not vice versa. We have to do with a special act of God to us, corresponding to the special nature of our apostasy, and in this special act we have to do with the really immutable."58 In other words, this seemingly second salvation history be- comes our noetic standpoint for interpreting "natural" history, the special act becomes our hermeneutical basis for understanding each and every other sustaining act of "general" existence. This means, particularly in light of the Fall, one simply cannot take for granted the givenness of the natural causal nexus. It is radically and completely contingent. No inde- pendent, essentialist metaphysical matrix undergirds it. Rather, each mo- ment of existence requires a new, gracious act of God-an act which, while in no way predetermined by any general principle or law, is never- theless reliable. It has this reliability because it is determined by the free and omnipotent constancy of the living God, whose divine will is deter- mined by the divine love, enacted and revealed concretely in the new, special act of God in Christ. CONCLUDING REMARKS Let me now consider the arguments presented above, summarizing what each theologian has done and describing their continuity and develop- ment. In the First Part of his Glaubenslehre, Schleiermacher echoes the voice of tradition in asserting the simplicity of God. Yet he does so in order to maintain the uninterruptedness of God's creative and preserving causality, not the traditional doctrine of God as such. That is, "immutabil- ity" serves to exclude any alteration of divine activity and rest, any sense that the divine governance of the world might be divided or lapse or 57 Ibid., p. 540. 58 Ibid., p. 507. 399</page><page sequence="21">The Journal of Religion allow an alien causality to intervene counter to its ground and purpose. (In Dorner's terms, Schleiermacher so fears the problems of polytheism that he goes to the other extreme of Deism.) Yet Schleiermacher's change from the classic view becomes obvious in the Second Part in the way he treats and develops the traditional assertion of the primacy of love among the divine attributes. As the only attribute equivalent to the divine es- sence, a distinction is recognized in the divine simplicity: love becomes the ground and purpose for all God's causality, and that love enacts God's redemptive work in Christ. Indeed, God's redemptive work stands not as one particular example among others of the general divine causality in the world. Rather, it predetermines that casuality throughout.59 In sum, Schleiermacher does not describe divine immutability as detached or neutral; rather, he portrays a loving God ordaining and governing the world's course on the basis of the one divine decree, toward its consum- mation in Christ. Dorner's innovation is to take Schleiermacher's emphasis and make it the explicit center of his doctrine of immutability, while presenting the whole notion as an ethical, rather than metaphysical concept. Dorner also raises the issue of freedom: if everything is as predetermined as Schleier- macher's schema suggests, no room remains for either human freedom and real ethical responsibility or novelty in the course of history. The upshot would be a diminished understanding of humanity and God. Dorner seeks to correct these implications, primarily through his por- trayal of a transference of divine power and purposes to human agency. His treatment also seeks to be more faithful to Scripture and tradition, as evidenced by its closer correspondence to biblical images of a living, historically active God and by its grounding in an expressly Trinitarian framework. It should come as no surprise, then, that Barth's exposition of divine immutability incorporates so much of Dorner's treatment. Not only does it help fill a rather significant and long-standing gap in Barth's doctrine of God, it also displays a marked compatibility with his theology overall, both in content and tone. In some instances, it appears Barth simply fits what he received from Dorner into his own framework, without much alteration. But in other instances, he tailors and expands parts to corre- spond more closely to his own recurring motifs and concerns and to the structures of Church Dogmatics II/1 particularly. Most interesting, Barth completes and makes explicit the shift from a metaphysical to an ethical construal of God's relation to the world by means of his characteristic "particularism." 5 See p. 388 above. 400</page><page sequence="22">Dorner on Divine Immutability In conclusion, Schleiermacher does hold to a notion of the metaphysi- cal unchangeability of God, insofar as there could be no interaction, no "give and take" between the divine and the created realm. Nevertheless, the supreme divine attribute of love determines the fundamental relation of God to the created order. So while God's interaction with the natural, historical order is "closed" at creation, that order is predisposed in a par- ticular way to God's redemptive purposes. Dorner, in turn, takes this in- sight regarding the divine nature and incorporates it explicitly into his doctrine of God. He then suggests that divine interaction with the world occurs not just in the initial establishment of the order of creation, but in an ongoing reciprocity with free creatures acting within that order to ex- tend the love and reign of God. Thus, God's relation to creatures within the evolving natural, historical order can indeed change-as can the di- vine being itself-precisely because an ethical immutability requires it in dealing with personal, mutable human beings.60 Still, Dorner seems to imply the existence of a "two-tier relationality" of God to the world. The higher tier consists of open interaction with conscious, free agents, and the lower tier is similar to Schleiermacher's understanding of God's un- changing preservation of the natural causal nexus.61 Barth agrees fully with the former position but rejects any view that would suggest an au- tonomous existence for, or an "automatic" divine undergirding of, the natural, historical order. In effect, any independent natural law or "meta- physics" is done away with; only the personal/ethical, that is, the divine being/will, remains. But because one can rely on God's self-constancy (after all, that constancy itself defines the very notion of reliability), the world's derivative constancy continues through God's ever-new act. Thus, the development of the doctrine of immutability from Schleiermacher to Dorner to Barth shows clear signs of both dependence and innovation. It is therefore fitting to describe Dorner-on this topic at least!-as the missing link between the "Father of Liberal Christianity" and his most famous critic. 60 Williams and Welch, trans., pp. 180, 184. 61 Consider the following claim, and the implication of its concluding phrase: "For the perfection of man must be mediated through his freedom, and the highest receiving can only come to a receptivity that is perfected throughout a rich historical reciprocal relation of divine imparting and human willing to receive. In this process, God does in no way always give just the same, as in the physical realm the sun shines alike on the just and unjust" (ibid., p. 185, my emphasis). 401</page></plain_text>
