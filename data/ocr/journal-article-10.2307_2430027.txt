<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Principles of Pollination Ecology. By K. FAEGRI and L. VAN DER PIJL. 9 x 6 in. Pp. ix +248 with 5 text-figures. Pergamon Press: Oxford. 1966. Price 63s. The scope of this book is roughly that indicated by such phrases as 'Flower Pollination', 'Floral Mechanism' and 'Floral Biology' in the titles of certain well-known botanical texts. Its coverage is, however, greater, partly because it takes into account relatively recent work on incompati- bility and on animal (especially insect) behaviour, but chiefly because of the wide interests and critical approach of its authors. Above all it is concerned with the living plant in its natural habitat. Apart from a brief (too brief) historical survey and some short introductory chapters on techniques and spore dispersal, the bulk of the book is taken up by a long chapter on 'Pollination' and by the 'Case Histories' of forty-five selected species. Other topics dealt with include 'Retrograde Developments', 'Pollination Ecology and Speciation' and 'Applied Pollination Ecology'. Although the valuable list of references runs to twelve pages there are still some notable omissions. For nearly three hundred years, since Camerarius first proved by experiment the sexuality of plants, the subject of Pollination Ecology has undergone great changes in popularity, chiefly because its leading investigators, however brilliant their own researches, failed to unravel the full complexity of the principles involved and commonly made unwarranted assumptions and generalizations which proved unacceptable to other biologists. Failure to understand the funda- mental difference between pollen transference from one flower to another on the same plant (geitonogamy) and on a different plant (xenogamy) was commonplace until the genetical basis and advantages of cross-fertilization were fully understood. Such confusion persists in otherwise excellent works which are still widely used. In classical pollination ecology, especially in its post-Darwinian heyday, floral mechanism was often deduced from floral structure, sometimes correctly, sometimes not. Observations were often made on exotics in gardens far from their natural habitats and pollen-vectors. In Church's book on 'Types of Floral Mechanism' most of the examples are exotics, for which observations in their native lands were wholly lacking when he wrote. Some workers, obsessed by the belief that all species must be cross-pollinated, detected adaptations which do not and cannot exist. More recently, emphasis has shifted to direct observation, often photographic, of the plant and its pollen vectors in their natural habitat. Work in the tropics has shown that pollination by bats and birds is much more important and varied than had been previously supposed. Experi- ments with pollen vectors, particularly with insects, has enabled the colour and structure and</page><page sequence="2">232 Reviews movement of flowers to be explained in terms of the vectors' physiology and behaviour. Much of the important recent literature is widely scattered and not generally available so that Professors Faegri and van Der Pijl have performed a useful service in producing this critical synthesis of their own and other people's work. It is chiefly concerned with principles and is not intended to be a comprehensive, factually complete manual. It should stimulate a wide range of people and lead them on to the many problems that remain unsolved, serving as a signpost and not, as in the case of Knuth's massive work, . . . a tombstone. The book is meant primarily for University teachers and their students and contains so many and varied original observations and stimulating ideas that it could be used as the basis for courses in any part of the world. It badly needs to be, especially in the tropics. Phyto- graphers are busy in many countries, tropical and temperate, writing about tropical plants, too often as museum specimens, not as living organisms. Their works would be more useful and inspiring if they told us how the flowers they so painstakingly describe actually work. Too often they don't know and probably don't care. Yet in some groups, e.g. Asclepiadaceae, structure is meaningless unless the function is known. Hundreds of people who are currently collecting plant (and animal) specimens in the tropics are wholly ignorant of pollination ecology. They should read this book. Among the many topics included, two are dealt with at length-the nature and production of attractants (pollen, nectar, brood-place, sexual attraction, food bodies, odour, visual attraction, motion) and animals as pollinators (beetles, small flies, carrion flies, wasps, ants, bees, butter- flies, moths, birds and bats). The accounts of ornithophily and chiropterophily, the latter incorporating much original research by van der Pijl, should be particularly interesting to those w7ho haven't been to the tropics or subtropics and may not know that such familiar plants as Aloe, Kniphofia, Fuchsia, Epiphyllum and Poinsettia are pollinated by birds and Cobaea and Musa by bats. The case histories have been chosen to illustrate the principles dealt with elsewhere in the book. In some cases references are given to important accounts (e.g. Calycanthus) but elsewhere the authors don't indicate what is original or has been checked by them. Most species are clearly and succintly described, but better accounts of Ficus have been published elsewhere and the description of Nymphaea citrina based on observations made by Schmucker in a glasshouse is not very convincing and should not have been included. The figures would have been better with less shading. Although writing in a language not their own, the authors have nearly always made their meaning clear; only occasionally do they misuse a word or use a clumsy phrase. Sometimes their expressions are anthropomorphic but their imagery can be both vivid and apt as when they say that 'bees are ill at ease in a Magnoli.a flower which has no "leading structures" (like a small child in a big bed).' A glossary and a better subject index would have been useful. F. WHITE</page></plain_text>
