THE aborigines of Japan have frequently been called a simple and stupid race. For wellnigh sixteen years the author of this paper has made the Ainu people his special study, but he must confess that he fails to see wherein this simplicity and stupidity consists. Doubtless to a cynical and superficial observer, or to a mere pass- ing stranger, there can be nothing to learn from the Ainu, but the thoughtful and careful student of human nature and natural religions will surely find a whole fund of wisdom and knowledge hidden in the dross and accumulated matter which goes to make up the sum total of their folk-lore. The following notes should be looked upon as a mere fragment. The ground touched upon must be considered as simply scratched, and that very lightly. The present time is occupied in observation and collecting tools: the real work of definition, classification, and explanation must follow later on.</page><page sequence="2">x6 yournal of American Folk-Lore. The Ainu and all things appertaining to them are fast passing away. They have been, and still are, greatly overreached by the Japanese who reside among them. And, though we had some faint hopes that Government would do something to preserve the race, we have now been obliged to give them up, and we can do nothing but gaze and wonder and pity while they are compelled to go to the wall and others allowed to appropriate their land without any attempt at restitution. But such is often the way of man in his dealing with a brother. But I am not now writing a moral essay; I will, therefore, go at once to the subject immediately in hand and speak of the folk-lore, not the folk. A large proportion of the following material is entirely new mat- ter. A little of it has seen the daylight in the form of notes to a newspaper, and yet a smaller proportion has already appeared in other connections in my book, "The Ainu of Japan." For the sake of convenience and order I have divided my paper so as to touch upon four points especially. These are, namely: I. SPIRIT. II. THE HOME OF SPIRITS. III. THE MANIFESTATION OF SPIRIT IN THE ORIGIN OF THINGS. IV. SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL MATTERS. I. SPIRIT. (a) Spirit Life. It seems to be a firmly fixed belief among the Ainu that no exist- ing life can ever cease to be. By life they mean living spirit, for life and spirit are never separated in their mind, nor indeed can be. Life is to them the most intensely energetic and natural subject that exists, and, in its higher form, they speak as though they look upon it as both substance and attribute, attribute and substance at the same time; and they suppose that there can be no energy, whether latent or expressed, without life, nor life without energy. This prin- ciple kept steadily in view will explain many most puzzling and otherwise inexplicable assertions and allusions current among them, by which they speak of inanimate powers as living gods and fearful demons, of gods and men and demons as dead yet alive, as slain in one battle yet appearing and fighting in another. With this people, spirit appears to be looked upon as the principle of life behind life- the very indestructible quintessence of being or existence. This life, or living spirit, having once been brought into existence, always is and ever shall be. In its abstract form, i. e., in its essence, it can- not be seen, though it may be heard, as in the roar of the thunder and in the rushing of the mighty winds. But in substance, i. e., in its concrete form, its energy may be seen and experienced as in ourselves</page><page sequence="3">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. and other phenomena in nature. Hence, therefore, to speak of a dead spirit- a life without spirit - would be modes of expression alto- gether foreign to the Ainu language and incomprehensible to the people. Hence, again, extinction, which many of our own race appear to associate with the idea of death, is found to be quite alien to the Ainu idea thereof. The spirit never dies and is never lost, though the body in which it resides for the time being may indeed cease to exist. And this principle is applicable to all living organisms. A man, though dead, still exists elsewhere in a semi-material, semi- ethereal body, and as a manj a cat as a cat, and a dog as a dog. All have their use and calling in another world. The mode by which the Ainu express the idea of dying exactly coincides with all this. Thus: "To pierce the skies ;" "to make a clearance;" "to have a space for thought;" "to go away;" "to leave behind;" " to leave this world behind;" "to be wound up in sleep;" "to sleep the other sleep;" "to lose bodily strength;" "to go to the other world;" "to rest;" "to abdicate one's vil- lage." These expressions and many others like them all find their explanation in the principle I have just enunciated. It is very curi- ous to remark in passing that the Ainu consider the back-bone to be the seat of life. Hence we find warriors could never be slain, i. e., disembodied, unless the back-bone was cut! (b) Spirit in Connection with Matter. Although according to Western ideas living spirits of any kind have no visible or extended parts, yet the Ainu always appear to connect them with some form and kind of matter. Thus we fre- quently hear of them as existing in trees, animating the storms, rid- ing upon the wind, roaring in the thunder, dwelling in animal form, going to and resting in the sun. Both gods and devils go to war, ride in chariots, look out of human eyes, speak with human language, fight with swords and spears. Even the Creator himself is con- ceived of as possessing a body like that of a man. Yet this body, though spoken of as if it were matter which could be mutilated, de- stroyed, and dissolved, is, on the other hand, also thought to consist of some indestructible ethereal substance. And this bodily substance being of such a nature, both gods and demons have the power of now appearing visibly to us and now making themselves invisible at will. Hence, too, when a god is slain in war the form of his living spirit ascends to the skies with a mighty sound. But here again we must be careful to mark that the Ainu seem to distinguish, as indeed such thorough sons of nature as the Ainu must, between the various kinds of matter animated by the deities. Thus a god may appear localized and stationary, as in a tree or loco- VOL.

But the destruction of the inner body, i. e., the god or spirit itself, is not in the least implied. The destruction of a body, whatever its form may be, whether it be that of a tree, brute beast, or a man, is merely like stripping off one coat to discover another beneath it. The spirit still retains its inner form, whatever may become of its outer garment by which and in which it is manifested. Hence it will be seen that matter is not animated in such a way as to have life in itself and apart from the spirit which animates it. This enshrining of superhuman living spirits in some bodily form is to my mind perfectly natural to all unenlightened reason, or reason enlightened only with natural religion. Man's imagination has no- thing to work upon in its thought-creations but a very limited experi- ence. When the finite mind desires to picture the infinite Being, which it is surely unreasonable to suppose it can fully comprehend, there is no alternative left but to clothe it with limitations of form; and all form, since it cannot but be extended and thus exist in space, must necessarily be limited in degree. The same law in human nature which has led the poet and the artist to express and image for us a Satan and an Abdiel, the Imp and the Cherub, has led the Ainu to picture God as a man, and to give claws to the Devil. And just as with us all pictures of the spiritual agencies must ever fall far short of our conceptions of those things, so it is with the Ainu in their thought-pictures of these beings: they are always far below their ideals and ever must be. Moreover, just as in a landscape or picture one person sees a very great deal and another scarcely any- thing at all, just as one may be struck with the beautiful lines of perspective and another can hardly tell the background from the foreground, so these mental pictures of spiritual agencies may mean one thing to one man and something quite different to another; this man may see one thing which the other did not, and the other may perceive something this man did not. In this way, therefore, may we account, in very great measure, for the many apparently unrecon- cilable contradictions to be found in Ainu folk-lore. (c) God. The Ainu are firm in their belief that the phenomena of this ma- terial universe are the expressions of a mighty spirit exercising mind and will, and that man, in his higher nature, is the finite rep- resentative of Him. In this belief must be sought the reason why the Ainu are often very anthropomorphic in their expressions when speaking of God. The Ainu word for God is Kamui, which word, I8</page><page sequence="5">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. taken just as it stands means, "the over-shadower," or "he who covers." The Japanese word Kami probably owes its origin to the Ainu word, as do very many of the place names all over Japan. In its actual use kamui is applied very much as the Greeks used the word daimon (3a/tov). The oldest Japanese word for God was Kamu, and, like the Ainu word, was also anciently used in the same way as daimon and kamui; and just as with the Greek daimones (8auovegs) were spirits good and bad, so the Ainu kamui are also good and bad spirits. Hence, therefore, it must not be thought that because in Ainu mythology gods and demons are spoken of as though they were men and women, that they are in fact so thought to be. (d) Plurality of Gods. The Ainu are very polytheistic in their conception of deity. They worship spirits innumerable and live in a whirl of godly fear. But higher and more important than all gods, there is one who is looked upon as chief and King over all the rest, and he is the Creator. Be- neath him there are supposed to be multitudes of spirits all engaged in executing his will. He is King, they are his officers. And all these lower deities are actually called gods, but the very best terms we can know them by are mediators and angels; for in the fullest sense of these words they are so. They are continually passing to and fro to mediate between God the Creator and men, between gods and the universe, and between those angels of higher and lower authority. Each spirit has his special sphere in which to act, and his own peculiar rank and degree of importance, and each has his own work to do which none but he has authority to perform. (e) Demons. As there are supposed to be gods innumerable, so are there multi- tudes of demons. Demons, too, like the gods, have their chief or king, and they are also called by the term Kamui. In fact, one can only tell whether an Ainu is speaking of a god or demon by the context, or by adjectives prefixed to or nouns following that term. The government of the world of devils is conducted in the same way as that of the gods. As the Creator has his angels, so the chief of the devils has his fiends. In his sphere God is supreme and his will must be carried out; likewise the devil is supreme in his sphere, and he, too, must be obeyed by his angels. Why the devil is allowed to exist and where he came from are questions to which I have as yet received no reply from the Ainu. He is, and that is all about it, and enough too. 19</page><page sequence="6">20 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. (f) Dualism. There being two such antagonistic principles in the world as gods naturally good and demons naturally evil, it necessarily follows that there must be the idea of dualism current among the people. With- out going further with this question, I will quote a passage I have published elsewhere which well illustrates this fact. Rep un Kamui. These are the gods of the sea. They are two in num- ber. One is thought to be good and the other to be evil. Their names are Shi acha and Mo acha, and they are brothers. Shi acha, who is the elder, is ever restless, and is continually pursuing and persecuting his brother. He is the originator of all storms and bad weather, and is the direct cause of all shipwrecks and deaths from drowning in the sea. He is much feared, but never worshipped. Shi means "rough," "wild," " strong," and Acha " uncle." The corresponding river evil deity is called Sarak Kamui,l and she is the cause of all river accidents, and is bitterly hated. Mo acha, which means "the uncle of peace," is said to be the god of fine weather. He it is who is worshipped at all the seaside fishing-stations, and it is to him that the clusters of inao (called nusa) one may often see upon the seashore are generally offered. 1 Sarak is a word meaning accidental death, and Sarak Kamui appears to be a god or demon who presides over accidents. Its evil deeds are not confined ex- clusively to the fresh waters, but it is also thought to be the cause of all land acci- dents. When an accidental death has taken place on shore, either from drowning or otherwise, the Ainu, as soon as they find it out, proceed to perform a certain cere- mony frequently called Sarak Kamui. The ceremony is as follows: The inevit- able sake is of course first procured by the relatives of the victim of Sarak Kamui. Then messengers are sent round to the different villages to invite the men and women to join in the ceremony. The men bring their swords or long knives with them and the women their head-gear. On arriving at the appointed hut, the chiefs of the people assembled proceed to chant their dirges and worship the fire-god. Then, after eating some cakes made of pounded millet, and drinking a good pro- portion of sake, they all go out of doors in single file, the men leading. The men draw their swords or knives and hold them point upwards in the right hand close to the shoulder, and then all together they take a step with the left foot, at the same time stretching forward to the full extent the right hand with the sword, and call- ing, as if with one voice, wooi; then the right foot is moved forward, the sword at the same time being drawn back and the wooi repeated. This is continued till the place of accident is reached. The women follow the men; and with dishevelled hair, and their head-gear hanging over the shoulders, they continue to weep and howl during the whole ceremony. Arrived at the place of accident, a continual howling is kept up for some time, and the men strike hither and thither with their swords, thus supposing to drive away the evil Sarak Kamui. This finished, the people return to the house of the deceased in the same order as they came forth, and, sad to say, feast, drink sake, and get intoxicated. The ceremony attending Sarak Kamui is properly called Niwen-horobi.</page><page sequence="7">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. (g) The Devil and the Sun. This fight between the good and evil principles is also very clearly illustrated by the following legend of the devil attempting to swal- low the sun. The tale runs as follows:- When God created the world, the evil one did all he could to frustrate his designs, especially with regard to human beings. Now, after all things were made, the evil one perceived that men could not possibly live without the light-giving and warmth-giving sun. He, therefore, made up his mind to destroy that beautiful and useful work of creation, and thereby injure men. So he got up early one morning, long before the sun had risen, with the intention of swallowing it. But God knew of his designs, and made a crow to circumvent them. When the sun was rising, the evil one came, and opened his mouth to swallow it; but the crow, who was lying in wait, flew down his throat, and so saved the sun. Hence the crows, remember- ing the benefits they once conferred upon the human race, have an idea that they may do just as they like with men, and live upon the food they provide for themselves and families. Thus we find that they have good cause for being bold and saucy, and it is not for men to say that crows are useless creatures. II. THE HOME OF SPIRITS. (a) Tartarus. So far as I can understand, there appears to be but one place where superhuman spirits do not dwell, and that is Tartarus. That Tartarus figures in Ainu mythology cannot be denied. It is not pretended, however, that the Tartarus of the Ainu is quite the same as the Tartaros (Taprapo') of Homer. Tartarus, as described in the Iliad, is a deep and sunless abyss, as far below Hades as heaven is above the earth. It is closed in by iron gates, and into this place Zeus hurled those who rebelled against his authority, Later writers undoubtedly considered it to be the place of punishment for the spirits of the wicked, and the poets of yet later date consider the name to be synonymous with Hades. But it seems to me, so far as I am able to judge by ancient Ainu traditions and the interpreta- tion as given by those living to-day, that the Ainu do not mean Sheol or Hades, where all men go at death, when they speak of that place. In the Ainu tongue Hades is called Pokna-moshiri, "the under-world." Nor do they mean Gehenna, where the wicked are punished, for that is called Nitne Kamui moshiri, " the world of the devils," and Teine-pokna-moshiri, "the wet underground world." Tartarus, in their idea, is not the abode of men in any condition. They consider it to be the bounds of this material creation. The word Tartario (Taprapdo), "to hurl into Tartarus," occurs once and but once in the Christian Scriptures, and that only in the place 21</page><page sequence="8">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. where we are told that the angels, when they sinned, were not spared, but cast down to Tartarus and committed to pits of dark- ness. Hence, the Scripture meaning of Tartarus, being very closely allied to the idea of that place as gathered from the Iliad, also dif- fers from the Ainu idea thereof. Yet, though their conception of Tartarus seems to differ from both Greek and Christian representations in some respects, it is found to agree with each in other respects. As regards place, it is thought by the Ainu to be situated at the very confines of all created worlds. There are supposed to be six worlds beneath this upon which we dwell. The very lowest of these is called Chirama moshiri, "the lowest world." I can find no word better suited to designate this place than Homer's Tartaros (Taprapos). But as regards the nature of this land, it is not supposed by the Ainu to be a place of darkness. It is said to be a very beautiful country, and as full of light as this world; and it seems not to be the prison-house or abode of fallen angels or of any other living beings, whether they be gods, men, or demons. The thunder god, or more properly the thunder demon, after once waging war upon this earth, is said to have pro- ceeded to do so in heaven because this world was unable to stand such a grievous conflict. The Creator, who resides in heaven above, was very much distressed at this, and sent the demon to fight in Chirama moshiri, " Tartarus." Here the thunder demon was slain, and, as no god or demon can actually die, his spirit again ascended to its original home, namely, the lower heavens or clouds. Such, then, is the Ainu tradition -vague, indeed, it may be thought, but still it is a tradition - concerning Tartarus. (b) The Confines of Heaven. Just as the Ainu consider Tartarus to be situated on the lower confines of the earth, so there is supposed to be a corresponding lower region to the heavens. I have just stated that the thunder demon, when defeated in Chirama moshiri, ascended to his original home in the lower skies. That home is thought to lie at the very confines of the air. Though some Ainu say that there are six skies above us, yet I have been able to get the names of but three. The lower heavens are called Range kando, " the let down " or "hanging skies;" also Urara kando, "the fog skies." The next in order are called Nochiu-o kando, "the star-bearing skies;" and the highest heavens are named Shzinish kando, "the high skies of the clouds." The highest heavens are supposed to be inclosed and guarded by a mighty metal wall or fence, and the entrance to them has a large iron gate. I have frequently heard the Ainu speaking of the opening and shutting of this iron gate of heaven. The highest heaven is said to 22</page><page sequence="9">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. be the special home of the Creator and the more important orders of angels. The second or "star-bearing-skies " comprise the dwelling- place of the second orders of gods and their angels. Demons are supposed to reside in the clouds and air immediately surrounding our earth. (c) Materialistic Expressions applied to Heaven. Just as we find that the Ainu very frequently apply materialistic expressions to immaterial spirit, so, it is very interesting to remark, they often import most materialistic ideas into their conception of heaven; and yet, all things considered, it is so intensely natural that they should do so that we cannot possibly wonder at them or call them unreasonable for so doing. The Ainu have had no Chris- tian revelation to inform them as to the nature of heaven, and that they or any one else should have any connate and intuitive knowledge thereof is, I suppose, altogether out of the question. As heaven, according to their ideas, is surrounded by a metal wall and has an iron gate, so the Creator is supposed to reside in an iron house. The idea the Ainu intend to convey by this is undoubtedly durability, security, richness, and beauty. Even multitudes of Christians of every age and country are found to convey materialistic ideas in their thoughts of a spiritual place and state called heaven. It seems to be impossible, as things are now constituted and conceived of, not to do so. The " portals," " shining gates," "pearly gates " of heaven, like Jerusalem the Golden, are all Christian expressions. They are poetical and beautiful modes of expressing thought, indeed, and though we may say that they are not exact, certainly are they not wrong or unreasonable modes of expression. They are highly figu- rative of the beauty and richness of heaven. I have called your attention to the Ainu expression, "iron gates of heaven," because it is one which goes to prove the universality of the fact that all human ideas of the spiritual must be imaged by expressions drawn from the material; and that however much man may endeavor to express his ideas of the beauties of heaven, the attributes of God, and the infinitudes of number, space, and time, he must ever fall far short of his ideals. To understand many of the peculiarities of Ainu belief, it will be found necessary to keep this principle contin- ually in view. (d) Powers of the Air. The words "Prince of the dominion of the air" are familiar to us all. It was quite a current doctrine of old times that Satan and his angels have their dominion in the lower air. St. Jerome says: "It is the opinion of all the doctors of the Church that the inter- vening air between heaven and earth is full of adverse powers." 23</page><page sequence="10">yournal of American Folk-Lore. This is exactly the opinion of the doctors of Ainu mythology also. Dobell, the Siberian traveller, tells us that the Kamtchatdales be- lieve the evil spirits ride on the winds and direct the tempests.1 So do the Ainu of Yezo. In everything adverse to what the Ainu con- ceive to be the well-being of man they think they discover a demon. It should not be overlooked, however, that the air around us is peo- pled with good as well as evil spirits. (e) Rain-making. That the powers of the air can be influenced by the actions of men is apparent from the following incident. On the occasion of some very dry weather, when the land was parched and the gardens suffering from want of water, I heard the Ainu talking about " Rain- making," during the discussion of which subject several new words and phrases struck upon my ear. One phrase was Shirimen hokki marapto, " Ceremony for producing wet weather;" another was Shirimen hokkigutu, "The person who produces wet weather;" and another was Apto ashte guru, " The person who causes it to rain." When the Ainu desire to perform the ceremony of "rain-making," the people are collected together, and prayers said to the goddesses of fire, rivers, and springs by the appointed "rain-maker." Abun- dant libations of wine are of course offered and drunk. The master of the ceremonies then appoints certain men to head small compa- nies, and commands them to proceed to execute particular functions. One man is told to take his company to the river's brink, and there to see that each one washes his tobacco-box and pipe in the running water. Another is ordered to catch a small fish, called eshokka, light a pipe, and place the stem in its mouth; the fish thereupon closes its mouth, and, in the act, draws in a little of the smoke, which is seen to escape from the gills. After this the fish is allowed to escape. Another party is commanded to take a porringer, fit it up with sails, and place oars in it as though it was a boat. Next, some are told to push and others to draw it about the village and gardens. Another party is told to take sieves and scatter water about with them. Both men and women are allowed to take part in these pro- ceedings. The Ainu say that if this ceremony is properly conducted rain is sure to follow. A short time ago I saw some Ainu, who were longing for rain, dress up a dog in a most fantastic fashion, and, amid much noise and laughter, lead it about the garden: this was to make rain. As we had a heavy downfall that very night, the cere- mony was proved successful, and consequently the Ainu have stronger faith than ever in their ability to produce rain, and the powers of the air were proved to take notice of the actions of men. 1 See Dobell's Travels in Siberia, vol. i. p. 43. 24</page><page sequence="11">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. (f) The Goddess of the Sun. The sun and moon are looked upon by the Ainu as dwelling-places of gods. Concerning these luminaries I have written elsewhere as follows: - Chup kamui. The word chup signifies "luminary." These are two in number, called, respectively, Tokap chup kamui and Kunne chup kamui, i. e., "day luminary" and "night luminary," a "sun" and "moon." . . . By some the sun is considered to be the female principle, and the moon the male, but by others vice versa. The sun and moon are not supposed to be gods, but each a vehicle of some special ruler. They are not generally worshipped. They are called kamui on account of their usefulness in the system of nature, particularly out of regard to their usefulness in provid- ing light and warmth for human beings. For it should be remarked that a thing is thought to be good only in so far as it benefits men. A few years ago I was among the Ainu when an eclipse of the sun took place. I took that opportunity of writing and sending to a newspaper what I saw on that occasion. As what I then wrote is most closely connected with the matter in hand, I now take the lib- erty of producing it as an illustration of Ainu ideas concerning the nature of the sun. On the morning of the Igth August, I887, we proceeded to blacken some glass so as to enable the Ainu to see the eclipse when it took place. At the proper time we produced the glass, and bade the Ainu to look at the sun. The result was worth seeing, for immediately the exclamation rang out, Chup rai, chup rai, " the luminary is dying," " the sun is dying." Another person called out, Chup chikai anu, " the sun is fainting away," or "the luminary is suddenly dying." This is all that was said; silence ensued, and only now and then an exclamation of surprise or fear was to be heard. But it was plainly evident that the people were in fear lest the eclipse should be total. The Ainu greatly fear a total eclipse of the sun, lest that luminary, having once quite died away, should not come to life again, and so all living beings perish. One would expect the Ainu people would worship the sun at this par- ticular time, but such is not the case. The Ainu are here consistent, and treat the sun as they do a dying or fainting person. When a person is dying (on one occasion I myself was present), one of the company will either fill his mouth with fresh water and squirt it into the sufferer's face and bosom, or will bring water in a vessel of some kind and sprinkle him with his hand, thereby attempting to revive him. So we find that, when there is an eclipse (particularly a total eclipse) of the sun, the people will bring water and sprinkle it upwards towards that luminary, thinking thereby to revive it, at the same time calling out, Kamui-atemka, kamui-atemka, " O god we revive thee, O god we revive thee." If the water is sprinkled with branches of willow, it is supposed to have special efficacy and power in 25</page><page sequence="12">yournal of American Folk-Lore. bringing the sun back to life, for the willow is the sacred tree of the Ainu, and all inao or religious symbols are made of that wood. But when there is a visible eclipse of the sun, the Ainu may be said to go fairly off their heads through fear, so that they have not always presence of mind or suffi- cient coolness of head to wait to get the willow boughs. The all-important thing is to get the water to the sun to heal its faintness. Hence, some persons may be seen squirting water upwards with their mouths, others throwing it up with their hands; some again may be using a common be- som, whilst a few will be seen with the orthodox willow branches in their hands; a few (particularly women and girls) will be seen sitting down and hiding their heads between their knees, as if silently expecting some dread- ful calamity suddenly to befall them. Such is the Ainu method of bringing the sun back to life. The sun having been restored to his normal condition of brightness and glory, the cunning old sake drinkers have a fine pretext for getting intoxi- cated. Of course, libations of wine must be held in honor of the sun's recovery from faintness and return to life, and the subject must be duly talked over, and ancient instances of a like occurrence recited. But a few cups of sake soon cause the talkers to speak what is not true or relia- ble, and they are not long before they begin to show signs of being in a somewhat maudlin state. Ainu traditions of eclipses are all of one stamp, and run thus:- "When my father was a child, he heard his old grandfather say that his grandfather saw a total eclipse of the sun. The earth be- came quite dark, and shadows could not be seen; the birds went to roost and the dogs began to howl. The black, dead sun shot out tongues of fire and lightning from its sides, and the stars shone brightly. Then the sun began to return to life, and the faces of the people wore an aspect of death; and, as the sun gradually came to life, the men began to live again." Such is a sample of Ainu traditions concerning solar eclipses. It only remains for me to remark that total eclipses, or, in fact, eclipses at all, are quite unaccountable to the Ainu; nor have I heard a sin- gle theory advanced with reference to their cause. (g) Demons on the Earth. As the demons of the air are so near this earth of ours, it is pos- sible for them to pay us frequent visits, and even to dwell among us. This accounts for so much that is evil in the world. Only a short time ago I was asking a man whether there were evil dryads in the forests as there are mermaids and water-nymphs in the lakes, rivers, and seas. Certainly, he said, great numbers of them. The genii who work evil to men are part of these, and though dwelling in the for- ests and mountains have their real home in the air around us. They are servants of the prince of devils. He said that he had never 26</page><page sequence="13">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. seen one, but he firmly believed they existed for all that. On asking another man what he would do, or what would be the best place to flee to if pursued by an evil genius, he said that the most secure hiding-place is close under the bank of a river where the running water has carried the soil away. The devil is certain not to be able to find a person hiding there, providing he did not see in what direc- tion the object of his pursuit ran! However, should he have seen in which direction a person went, the best thing to be done is to climb a tree, for though demons can also climb, yet a person may easily keep him off by hammering away at his claws with a branch! (h) Six, the Sacred or Perfect Number. I mentioned, when speaking of Tartarus, that that place is sup- posed to be situated in the sixth world beneath us. Now, among the Ainu we find that the number six is constantly recurring as the numerical exponent of perfection, and is regarded by the people as the sacred number. We often find it so appearing in their legends. Thus, when a religious feast was made, the wine for this purpose was procured by using six bags of rice; these were put into six tubs; when the wine was ready for use it was emptied into six vessels; and it was partaken of by six lords. Again, we hear of a boat having six oars, rowed by six men, and having six gods as passengers. Yet again, a warrior went forth to war. He came to six clouds and six banks of fog. Under thesehe found six rapids, and these were watched over by six lords. He fought and the six were slain. Further on, he met six men and six women clothed in stone armor; and further on six men and six women wearing metal armor. With a mighty forward sweep with his sword he slew three men and three women, in all six persons. But, not to multiply instances, I will conclude by remarking that the highest fine it was possible to inflict upon one Ainu by another was six garments! This was the fine which in ancient times the chiefs of the people are said to have imposed upon any of their subjects who were found learning the Japanese language; but since the Japanese officials forbade the Ainu to speak their own mother tongue that fine has been abolished. III. THE MANIFESTATION OF SPIRIT IN THE ORIGIN OF THINGS. (a) Hiow God created the Dry Land. In the beginning the world was a great slushy quagmire. The waters were hopelessly mixed up with the earth, and nothing was to be seen but a mighty ocean of bare sloppy swamp. All the land was mixed up with and aimlessly floating about in the endless seas. 27</page><page sequence="14">2ournal of American Folk-Lore. All around was death and stillness. Nothing existed in this chaotic mass; nothing moved, for it was altogether incapable of sustaining life; nor were there any living fowls flying in the airy expanse above. All was cold, solitary, and desolate. However, the clouds had their thunder demons, and the Creator lived in the highest heavens with the hosts of subordinate deities. Then the great God determined to make the earth inhabitable. He therefore made a water-wagtail and sent it down from heaven to produce the earth. When this bird saw the dreadfully shocking con- dition this world was in, he was almost at his wits' end to know how to perform his allotted task. He fluttered over the water with his wings, trampled upon the muddy matter with his feet, and beat it down with his tail. After a very long time of fluttering, trampling, and tail-wagging dry places appeared and the waters became the ocean. And so the worlds were gradually raised out of the waters and caused to float upon them. Therefore the Ainu call the world mo- shiri, "floating earth," and hold the water-wagtail in great esteem, for, was it not the angel of God ?" Such is the Ainu legend. I do not propose to stay and compare this legend with that of the Japanese as found in the "K6jiki," interesting though it would be. I simply report the Ainu idea of creation as I find it to exist among them. Thus, then, the world was produced out of already existing matter. After the earth was prepared for vegetation by the water-wagtail at the command of the Creator, trees appeared. But it is very inter- esting to remark that according to the most approved Ainu ideas the first tree that ever existed was the tree of evil. (b) The Tree of Evil. I learn from the Ainu that they have a tradition to the effect that the Alder, which they call Nitat kene-ni (Alnus japonica), was the first tree created. And one man told me that it must be, he thought, the same as "the tree of knowledge of good and evil" I had been speaking of a short time before. It is not supposed, however, that this tree was caused to grow or was created in our sense of the word. But it is said to have been sent direct from heaven already grown and planted in a land called Wenpipok, wherever that may be. This tree is supposed to be the origin of evil, or rather the means by which evil was brought into the world. I speak now not of moral evil, but physical; evil in the sense of causing bodily pain and suf- fering, but not evil in the sense of having brought sin into the world. The bark, not the fruit, is supposed to be the evil-causing agency. Even at the present day some Ainu consider it to be the direct cause of a disease called Shihapapu, a complaint which is said to consist 28</page><page sequence="15">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. chiefly in severe internal pains, and which most often terminates in death. Some time after this tree was planted the bark is said to have fallen off and rotted on the ground, as it does indeed at the present day. But as it decomposed and became a kind of powder, it was blown over the face of the earth by the winds, and in some mysteri- ous way became the cause of many kinds of bodily ailments. But, strange as it may appear, the bark of this tree is not only looked upon as the cause of illness, but is also used as a means for its cure. The bark, if taken fresh from the tree and a decoction made by steeping it in hot water, is said to work wonders. Not only are there special maladies for which it is to be particularly recommended, but it is also supposed to be good for any kind of disease. (c) The Elm-tree. Do not let it be supposed that the Ainu are all of one mind on so important a subject as to which tree was really first created. For while some hold it to have been the Alder, others give the prece- dence to the Elm, and stoutly maintain their belief by argument. The reasons for the elm as against the alder are something like this - (i.) Man existed before disease, for, unless there was some person to be ill, sickness could have no place. Granted. (2.) Health is naturally prior to sickness, and is the proper condi- tion of man. Also granted. (3.) Food and clothing are necessary to health, and cooking is equally necessary for the preparation of food. Granted again. (4.) But fire is necessary to cooking food, and the means for pro- ducing fire are also necessary before fire can be produced. Granted, of course. (5.) But before matches were brought by foreigners, and the flint and steel by the Japanese, our ancestors produced fire by rubbing the roots of trees together; also before clothing material was intro- duced among us by the Japanese, bark was used for making gar- ments. Granted. (6.) Those roots by which fire was produced and that bark out of which clothes were made came from the elm-tree. This is also granted. Now mark the conclusion of this Socrates. Hence, as the elm roots were originally necessary for producing fire, and as elm bark was necessary for making cloth; as fire was necessary for cooking, and cooking necessary for food; as food and clothing were necessary for health, and health, being the original state of man, was prior to sickness, therefore there must have been fire to cook with and 29</page><page sequence="16">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. clothes to wear, and elm roots and bark to produce them; hence the elm-tree and fire were the most ancient gods produced by God. The elm is therefore prior to the alder. "This is the house that Jack built" kind of argument is thought to be conclusive, and there is not much to be said against it. Those Ainu, however, who argue for the alder, against the elm, rest their main argument on the belief that fire originally came down from heaven. But as no one living has ever seen fire descend from heaven excepting in lightning, and lightning is not a very desirable thing, this argument is not considered to be so strong as the other, and the skeptics have pretty sure ground. Here I will remark, in passing, that on points like this there are plenty of skeptics among the Ainu, but I have never yet heard of an atheist among them. (d) The Snake. Speaking of the "tree of evil" brings to my mind the subject of the serpent and his connection with the fall of man. The Ainu are not different from many other nations in their superstitious fear of these reptiles; they have a very great dread of every kind of snake. Though the people do not seem to connect them with the entrance of sin into the world, yet many of them certainly believe snakes to be demons both in nature and deed, and to be at enmity with all man- kind; and they think that, having a special spite against women, they will bewitch them and drive them mad if they get the opportunity. To be bewitched by a snake or to be possessed by a devil are the same thing according to Ainu ideas. The men are afraid to kill these reptiles, because they think that the evil spirits which are supposed to dwell in them will, on leaving their former abode, enter the heart of the slayer. It is also said that, if a snake finds any person asleep out of doors, it will immediately enter the sleeper's mouth and take up its abode within him, the result being madness. I have never yet heard of the Ainu worshipping snakes. Some of the Ainu tell of a large serpent which is said to have been the immediate cause of wasps and stinging ants. This mon- strous reptile is, curiously enough, said to have been of the feminine gender, of an extraordinary length, and of such a beautiful color as to be quite charming to look upon. She was, however, a very dreadful and dangerous creature, for she used to devour whole villages of people, and even to swallow houses. One day this monster met an Ainu who was hunting far away in the forests, and tempted him to sin with her. - The Ainu, however, was a God-fearing man, and would not be led into danger, but manfully maintained his integrity. There- upon the serpent, instead of swallowing him up as he expected, told him that as a punishment he should be unable to die for a thousand 30</page><page sequence="17">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. years; and it came to pass that when this Ainu attained the age of a hundred years he shed his hair, beard, skin, and teeth, and became a child again, subject to all the ills and trials of babyhood, and this took place every time the poor fellow reached the age of one hun- dred years. He was quite unable to die till he had lived his thousand years, and had lost his hair and teeth ten times. At length this reptile was slain by the Ainu, but as its carcass became decomposed and fell to pieces the particles became stinging ants and wasps. By some Ainu snakes are supposed to live in large communities in the under-world, and in their real homes assume the bodily forms of men and women. They have houses and gardens just the same as human beings have. Their food, however, consists of dew. They have also a language peculiar to themselves. But their resemblance to men and women extends only to bodily form. Their hearts and natures are decidedly diabolical. They only assume the form of snakes when they come to the upper-world, and they never appear here except with the intention of doing some harm to human beings. The ancients of the Ainu once met together to pray God to take away these evil-working objects. He heard their prayer and deter- mined to starve them out. But when they were about to leave, a frog stepped forth and told them that, if they would but hold its leg in their mouth, they would not starve to death. One snake tried the remedy, and found the frog's leg so sweet that he swallowed its whole body. From that time to this frogs have been the staple food amongst the reptiles of Ainu-land. (e) The Origin of Mosquitoes. The following fable explains how the Ainu account for the origin of gnats, mosquitoes, and gadflies: " Once upon a time, many years ago, there was a great hobgoblin who had his home far away in the midst of the mountains of Ainu-land. In bodily shape he was like a hnan. His carcass was exceedingly large and was closely covered with hair. In fact, his skin was like that of a bear, so hairy was he. However, he had but one eye, and that was situated in the middle of his forehead, and was as large as a common pot-lid. This creature was a very great nuisance to the Ainu, for he had such a tremen- dous appetite that he was actually in the habit of catching, killing, and eating everything and anybody coming in his way. For this reason the people were afraid to go far into the mountains to hunt, for, though the one-eyed monster had been shot at many times, not an arrow had taken effect upon him. Now it happened one day that a brave hunter, who was an expert with the bow, unconsciously went near the haunt of this cannibal. While he was in pursuit of game he was astonished to see something brightly glaring at him through the 31</page><page sequence="18">yournal of American Folk-Lore. undergrowth of the forest. Upon drawing near to see what it was, he discovered it to be the big-bodied, hairy, fierce-looking hobgoblin. When he saw what it was, the hunter became so frightened that he knew not what to do; but he soon mustered sufficient courage to draw an arrow from his quiver, and, fitting it in his bow, stood on the defensive. As the creature drew nigh, the Ainu took a steady and deadly aim at his solitary eye, and being a good shot, hit it fair in the centre. The hobgoblin immediately tumbled down dead, for the eye was the vital - the only vital - part of his body. To make sure that so foul a creature and so deadly an enemy was quite killed and would not come to life again to trouble the people, the brave hunter made a great bonfire over his body and burnt it quite up, bones and all. When this was done he took the ashes in his hands and scattered them in the air so as to make doubly certain that the monster was thoroughly destroyed. But lo, the ashes became gnats, mosquitoes, and gadflies, as they were tossed upward. However, we must not grumble at these things, for the lesser evil of flies is not so bad as the greater evil of having the one-eyed man-eating monster amongst us." (f) The Origin of the Cuckoo. The water-wagtail, which, as I have pointed out, is supposed to have produced the dry land, came down from above for that express purpose. All birds, however, did not descend from heaven; some, like the cuckoo, had their origin in the earth. The legend concern- ing the origin of this bird is as follows: - "The bird was crying every day; it filled the whole earth with its noise. After a while it descended towards the mouth of the Saru River and came to the house of Benkei.' As it sat upon his nusa2 crying, Benkei put his head out of the window to look at it. He then gave the following command to the people: As the witch of the world, as the witch of villages, has come down, let the chiefs of the people keep themselves out of sight, and let the common people insult it. So commanded he. Therefore the chiefs hid themselves and the common people insulted it. "After this the bird went on, crying as it went, further down river. It came to the house of Yoshitsune, and, sitting upon his nusa, cried. Thereupon Yoshitsune put his head out of the win- dow to look at it. He then spake thus: 'Sir, you are indeed a great one, but you are now crying because you know not who were your ancestors. In very ancient times a foreigner landed at the 1 The henchman of the Japanese hero Yoshitsune, who fled to Ezo in the twelfth century, A. D. 2 Shavings used for religious purposes. 32</page><page sequence="19">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. mouth of the Saru River, and, as he was exploring the river's mouth, he dropped his pipe and tobacco pouch and lost them. But as it was not possible for them to lie upon the ground and rot, they were turned into a bird. You are that bird. It is because you know not who were your ancestors that you are crying so.' So spake Yoshitsune. This is an account of the origin of the cuckoo; this is the origin of the bird which calls, kakkok, kakkok." We should naturally conclude from this legend that the cuckoo is regarded as a bird of ill-omen by the Ainu. And such indeed appears to be the fact. (g) Birds of Ill-omen. So far as I have yet been able to gather, the principal birds of ill- omen among the Ainu are the owl, night-hawk, cuckoo, and some other large birds which the people call Kettanna and Okep. Okep really means "bad news," but what special bird the Okep or Ketanna is I have not yet been able to ascertain. It is considered by the Ainu to be extremely unlucky to see a bird of any kind fly across the moon. Should a person be so unfortunate as to see this take place, the only remedy is to change his name at once. I know of one man named Arakush Ainu now living at Chitose, who actually changed his name on this very account. (h) The Otter and the Fox. Not only are birds supposed to have assisted, as angels, in produ- cing the works of creation, but animals also played their part. The following legend will show how :- "The river otter was sent down by the Creator in order to make clothing for the foxes. He was told to clothe them in red. But the otter had such a very bad memory that, before he could accomplish his task, he quite forgot what color it should have been, and so made their skins white. Hence foxes were, when first discovered by the Ainu, of a white color, and not red as now seen. The fox was exceedingly angry at this piece of forgetfulness, and upbraided the otter finely for his carelessness and neglect of duty. White was too imposing a color to suit Reynard's tastes. In order, therefore, to remedy the mistake, the otter went to a stream, and, after catching a salmon, took out its roe. He then invited the fox to lie down, and, after mashing the fish-roe into a liquid, proceeded to rub it over its skin, and in that way changed its color from white to red. Hence it is that foxes are now red and not white as formerly. The fox was very much pleased with the change, and, in order to return the com- pliment for this good act, procured some bark of the Shikerebe-ni (Phellodendron arnurense), boiled it, and dyed the otter's skin with 33</page><page sequence="20">yournal of American Folk-Lore. the liquor, making it the beautiful dark brown color we now find it to be." It is not known, it seems, what color the otter was before the fox dyed him. It is said in this legend that foxes, when first discovered by the Ainu, were of a white color. This raises several questions in my mind. (i) Several Questions raised. Did the Ainu at one time know anything about the Arctic fox? It is quite possible and even highly probable that they did. The color of this animal is pure white in winter, varying from a brownish or bluish color in summer. This species of fox does not exist at present in Yezo. I have seen foxes on this island of three distinct colors, one very light or gray; another very red; and a third quite dark. Scientists inform us that the following species of foxes only are to be found here: Canisjaponicus, the common fox; and C. Alpi- nzs, Pall. The C. lagopus, L., is to be found on the Kurile Islands. Another question which this legend has called forth in my mind is this: May it not be fact that Yezo was once very much colder than it is now? The Ainu say that it was. If so, may not the Arc- tic fox (Vulpes lagopus) have formerly been found here? If not, may not the Ainu have entered Yezo from Siberia or European Asia, where that fox is found to exist ? These are questions which the Ainu of Yezo cannot answer, though perhaps those of Saghalien might be able to throw some light on the subject, should they be questioned. (j) A Legend of the Sun. On a certain occasion, when speaking with a man on the subject of the heavenly bodies, he surprised me by asking the question whether my books said anything about the sun having once, for a long period of years, risen in the west and set in the east! I was never more taken aback in my life. The man was perfectly sober and serious. Upon asking him why he put such a peculiar question he replied as follows : - "It has been handed down to us by our remote ancestors that, when the world was brought forth in the beginning, the quarter now called east was named west, and the west designated east. This was so because at the beginning of time the sun used to rise in the west and set in the east. But for some unknown reason God saw fit to change this order of things, and to make the sun rise and set in the quarters it now does. When this took place the Ainu were obliged to transpose the names east and west, for those designations would not apply under the altered condition of things, because Chup-ka (east) means 'the kindling of the luminary,' and Chup-pok (west) means 'the going under of the luminary."' Such is the tradition. 34</page><page sequence="21">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. IV. SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL MATTERS. (a) Forgetfulness of the Otter. "The otter is a most curious and wasteful creature, and can re- member nothing at all. As soon as he has caught a salmon he drags it ashore and just takes one mouthful out of the back near the head and leaves all the remainder of the fish. No sooner does he take a bite than he forgets all about it, throws the fish away, and sets out to catch another meal. He very seldom returns to finish what he had previously caught. He forgets all about it. This is the reason why a person with a bad memory is called ' otter-head.' " Such is the legend. With regard to this piece of folk-lore I will draw your attention to three facts, namely:-- (I.) At the present day the words "otter-head" are much used among the Ainu. Our servants often call themselves and one an- other by that name when they forget anything. In fact, it was this in the first place which caused me to inquire into the matter. (2.) The Ainu use the words "to be seized upon" or " to be pos- sessed by an otter." It is the belief of the people that otters, like other animals, have power to possess persons. Should they do so, loss of memory is the sure result! In short, a very forgetful person is always said to be "possessed by an otter." In this way, then, do the Ainu account for the psychological fact of forgetfulness. (3.) When the Ainu find fish which have been killed by otters they carry them home and use them for food. But when they eat such fish, or partake of the flesh of the otter itself, special prayers are said to the goddess of fire, asking her to protect them from the machinations of the evilly disposed otters. Not only so, but while eating, both men and women, old and young alike, tie a tara, i. e., "a sling used in carrying bundles," round their heads. This sling is said to keep the spirit of the otter from entering the brain, which the Ainu suppose to be the seat of memory. Should a person neg- lect to wear a tara while partaking of otter's flesh or fish caught by otters, he will pay the penalty by being possessed by an otter; and the next time he goes to the mountains to work he is certain to for- get a knife or an axe or a hoe or some other tool. (b) Double Fruits. I had a curious anomaly in my garden last year. It was a double vegetable marrow. I was going one day to cut half of it, to use in the kitchen. My servants entreated me not to do so, for, said they, should I eat it I should certainly be bewitched. Why, they could 35</page><page sequence="22">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. not tell me; none of them seemed to know. It is a fixed belief among the Ainu that double fruits and vegetables will, if eaten, be- witch people and bring misfortune. Should, however, one half of a double fruit be eaten, the remaining half must be partaken of also by the same person, the idea being that one half would counteract the evil influences of the other. Out of regard to my servants' scru- ples and fears I allowed that vegetable marrow to remain untouched. It was left to rot where it grew, and I am not bewitched. This one incident brings out the fact that the Ainu invest even vegetable life with an immaterial spiritual existence. But this is a point which I cannot further dwell upon now, and merely pass it over with the remark that, in studying religion as it exists among the Ainu, this is an article of faith which should not be lightly passed over. (c) " Cat Punishment." It is supposed by the Ainu that cats who have died or left this world have the power of bewitching people. I say cats who have died, advisedly, for the Ainu invest them with personality. But here again allow me to remind you that the individual life or spirit of all the lower animals, as well as that of men, is never supposed to be- come extinct or lose its own proper personal identity. Each has a distinct separate unit life in another world, with powers to act upon living agents in this. The spirits of cats which have been killed are especially addicted to bewitching people, and those of all animals have the power to do so. But should a person kill a cat, he may prevent himself being bewitched by it by eating part of it. Or, should a person be bewitched by any disembodied cat, he may, to cure himself, kill any other cat and eat it. The good effects of this are undoubted. The way cats bewitch people is to enter their body and cause them to imitate the gestures of a cat, to gradually waste away, and in the end to die a painful death while mewing like a cat. The name of this is called Meko pagoat, "cat punishment." I find there is also a "dog punishment," "bear punishment," and every other animal punishment. The same principle of the disease or punish- ment and its cure runs through all alike. (d) Selection of Proper Names. The selection of a proper name for a person is a very difficult matter indeed among the Ainu. It seems to form one of the great- est problems of married life, especially where the family is a large one. It is indeed true that the people only have one name each to trouble about, but the Ainu have so many superstitions and curious customs connected with this subject that the choice of a fitting name for a person is quite a formidable task. 36</page><page sequence="23">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. The chief difficulties connected with finding names for Ainu chil- dren (and adults also, for even grown-up people sometimes change their name) arise hence-- (i.) No one may be called by the name of a person who has passed away. When any one dies his or her name must die also. Should the names of a dead person be applied to a boy or girl, it is supposed that it would grieve the soul of the departed and be likely to call forth his or her displeasure. Some evil would be pretty certain to follow, for the spirits of the dead can, it is thought, act upon the living for good or evil. No person can therefore take the name of his deceased parent, friend, or ancestor. Ainu names do not knowingly recur. Not only so, but according to the Ainu it is far better not to revive the name of the dead, because one would be thereby re- minded of death itself, and this is a thing of which the Ainu are in constant dread. They always endeavor to banish the very idea of death from their thoughts. To mention the name of the dead brings to mind that which it is desirable to forget about, and should there- fore be carefully avoided. Nor is this all. The fact of receiving a deceased person's name is calculated to bring back to the mind of the living the dear one departed hence, and it is considered better not to do this. It is bad taste to do so. But why ? Because by mentioning the name of the dead the partially healed wounds of the sorrowful bereaved are likely to be thereby reopened and caused to bleed afresh. It will easily be seen, therefore, that there must al- ways be a great dearth of Ainu proper names, and that the mere naming of a person must necessarily be a source of great difficulty. (2.) Names in themselves are supposed by the Ainu to be lucky or unlucky, and to bring fortune or misfortune on a person, as the case may be. The people appear to invest them with power for good or evil, so superstitious are they; in short, the Ainu seem to live in a great whirl of superstition with regard to this as well as every other subject. Thus, for example, a child is of a weakly dis- position and is consequently always ailing; this is often thought to be because the name is an unfortunate one. It has therefore to be changed. I have repeatedly been asked to name or rename persons varying in age from four to eighteen, for this very reason. I know of one sickly child who is continually ill, and whose name has been changed by her parents and friends no less than four times, and only to-day I was asked as a great favor to think of a new and more for- tunate name for her! This superstition is very deeply fixed in the mind of the Ainu, and it will take a long time to eradicate it, for such ideas among such a people die very hard. (3.) Another difficulty lies in this: I mentioned just now that a person must not be called after his or her ancestors or deceased 37</page><page sequence="24">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. relations. In the same way he must not take the name of his living neighbor. Should such a thing be done it would be looked upon as a kind of theft, and treated accordingly. This custom probably arose from the idea that names bring good or evil, and a person needs all the good his name can bring, and does not care to have it divided up with another. In trying to find a name for a person I have several times been asked not to use such and such a name because it be- longed to some one else. (4.) Again, the name must have a good sound and meaning. That seems reasonable enough. In choosing a name for a person the other day, I spent two hours before I could fix upon one which would do. At last I suggested Rei-peka. Yes, that would do very well indeed, because it meant "a fitting name." I certainly thought that difficulty was got well over. But, lo, shortly after, word came asking me if I could kindly change it! The first syllable sounded too much like that of her mother's name, who had been dead about six years! In sheer desperation I therefore coined a name on the spot, and, much to my surprise, it is considered beautiful, and suits well. It will therefore be seen that in naming Ainu children many knotty points have to be avoided, and nice, delicate, and perplexing crotchets humored. However, do not let it be inferred from anything I have said above that all Ainu are scrupulous about naming their offspring. Some fathers, chiefs, and elder brothers, in whom is vested the right of giving names, are uncommonly mean and inconsiderate in this re- spect, and many utterly absurd and unmentionably filthy names are given. Chief Penri of Piratori is a very great transgressor in this respect; he is, even for an Ainu, an exceptionally filthy-minded old man. He does, of course, avoid all names by which others are and have been called, but he is very fond of bestowing such names as "the pot," "the kettle," "the chopstick," "soot," "dirty," and so on, besides many I cannot possibly here mention. Among the bet- ter class of names are: "The Grace of God," " Graceful," "Bright- ness," "Comforter," "The Eloquent One," "Deer Catcher," "The Bird's Mouth," and such like. The Ainu are gradually undergoing a change with regard to ap- plying names. Women are now beginning to take those of their husbands in addition to their own. They have been obliged to do this, as it is more convenient for registration purposes at the Japa- nese offices. But old customs die hard, hence before registration the men generally adopt and are registered in Japanese, but among themselves they retain and are known by their own native names. Thus, for example, my servant's Ainu name is Kararashutent, but he is registered in Japanese as Nakano Kinzo, a purely Japanese name; Kannari Taro's Ainu name is Ekashi-oka. 38</page><page sequence="25">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. The naming of Ainu children does not take place before the child is two or three years of age. The parents generally wait till some trait of character has developed itself, or the child has performed some peculiar act, before they give a name. These circumstances decide what it shall be called, for the word used generally points to something which took place in early life, and is sometimes not at all a bad index to character. Name-giving is called by a word meaning "name ceremony." This ceremony does not constitute a religious service, for prayers are not said and wine is not necessarily partaken of. It is custom- ary, however, for the person who names the child to make it some small present. It is considered to be unlucky not to do so. In the case of a boy the most lucky things to give are a sword-guard or wine-cup; and in the case of a girl, a piece of cloth. Thus one is forcibly reminded of the spoons and knives and forks presented to infants at their baptism in some Christian lands. That boys should be presented with a sword-guard or wine-cup, or, as in some cases, with both, is in itself of great significance. A sword-guard is, as its name implies, used specially for protection; as a present to a child it indicates a wish that the defence and pro- tection of the gods may be especially extended towards the recipient. It is worn round the neck as a charm. It is called by a word mean- ing " a thing for keeping safe." In cases of sickness I have known of its being used to charm away disease. On such occasions it is moved several times over and across the body, and at last placed upon the bosom of the sufferer. The presentation of a sword-guard to a boy is therefore full of meaning, and has religion, and that dis- ease of religion and imagination which we call superstition, at its basis. It may also have been formerly given as a token that the lad must grow up to be a defence to his country, hearth, and home. However that may have been, I can only bear witness to what the main idea is now; and in this case the presentation of a sword-guard to a newly named child is a token that the giver desires and prays that the protection of the gods may be bestowed upon and abide with him. The presentation of a wine-cup would seem to convey rather the idea of priesthood, and indicate that libations are to be offered with it, for the principal function of a priest (the head of every family is the priest among the Ainu) seems to be the offerings of libations of wine. It might possibly be objected to this that the Ainu had no wine before the introduction of Japanese sakd, and therefore the idea of a wine-cup indicating libations is of late growth. Such, however, is a mistake. The Ainu say they had a wine of their own long before they knew anything of the Japanese sakl. Sakl in Ainu 39</page><page sequence="26">yournal of American Folk-Lore. is called by three distinct names. Firstly, sak4, pure and simple; secondly, tonoto, "official milk;" and thirdly, chikusaashkoro, which means "wine we import" or "imported wine." Before the Ainu knew anything of this Japanese production, it is said that they made a wine of their own out of millet, which they called chirangeashkoro, " wine we produce." I have seen this drink both made and used, but could never bring myself to taste it. It is the color of milk, very thick, and quite harmless. At the present day it retains its old name, chirangeashkoro, and is often used in religious ceremonies. I know of no single case in which Japanese influence has been allowed to intrude itself upon the Ainu religion; for though the Ainu do often use sakg in their religious exercises, yet the partial substitu- tion of one kind of wine for another cannot be truly said to affect their religion. Wine is not religion, but merely a subsidiary to the performance of religion. It cannot, therefore, be fairly objected that the presentation of a wine-cup to a newly named child did not origi- nally convey the idea of priesthood because wine is of recent im- portation, for, according to the Ainu, they had both wine and a name for wine before the importation of Japanese sak,. However, what is the fact to-day ? At this present moment, when a person presents a wine-cup to a child he certainly intends to convey the idea that the recipient is a priest of the gods, and must before all things do his duty to them. Such, then, is the significance of the sword-guard and wine-cup when given at the function called by the Ainu "the naming ceremony." (e) Bears' Eyes. When the Kamtchadales kill a bear they stick a sharp knife into each eye and then rip up the belly. This they say is quite neces- sary, as bears have sometimes been known to recover, even after severe wounds, and kill the persons who have ripped them up with the intention of skinning them. Whereas, they say, if their eyes had first been put out they would not have seen anything, and those persons would have escaped.' The Ainu of Yezo seem to know nothing of this custom. When a man kills a bear he first skins it and then carefully takes out the eyes. Some hunters swallow the eyes raw, while others tenderly place them on a leaf and put them outside the east end of their huts. They treat the eyes of deer in the same way. I have several times asked why they swallow the eyes, and the only reply I have yet obtained is that they consider them too precious and beautiful to be thrown away. But I have a suspicion that they swallow them either to prevent themselves from being bewitched by the animals they slay or to render them clear-sighted when hunting and shooting. 1 Dobell's Travels in Siberia, vol. i. p.

On making inquiries as to the reason and use of this I find they are placed there as charms against contagious disease. They are supposed to be very effectual in preventing such scourges as smallpox and measles from entering a hut and attacking a family. Thus we find that even dis- ease as well as animal and vegetable life is conceived of as closely connected with spirit. The people appear to believe that the spirit or demon of disease walks in at the doors and windows of houses. But for some reason or other this spirit does not like the forepaws of hares, and will not come near a place where even a single paw is to be seen. Hence the custom of hanging them up over doors and windows. In order to render themselves further proof against this evil spirit of sickness, the people sometimes take the foot and gently scratch themselves with the claws. Or should one have already caught a complaint a gentle scratching with the claw is supposed to work wonders in driving out the disease and effecting a cure. Curi- ously enough the hind feet are not supposed to have any power at all, and are therefore thrown away. (g) Skulls. The skulls of hares are also used as charms, so indeed are the skulls of almost all other animals, as well as the heads of birds. These are usually stuck on poles and placed outside of the east end of Ainu huts, though some of them are decorated with Nusa and kept in a safe place within the hut. They are all called by a name which means "guardian gods." They are worshipped, and their chief function is to preserve the people from disease, keep them from being bewitched by the animals they have killed, and to gener- ally watch over their personal welfare. This is the chief use of the skulls to be seen stuck up outside the east end of Ainu huts, and in this we must seek their raison d'ltre. (h) Divination. But skulls, of some animals at least, are used for other purposes. Especially is this true of the fox. The skull of this animal is used for purposes of divination. In one of the Ainu villages in which I have spent many months, one of the men, with whom I am well acquainted, was one day very angry at having lost a paper dollar. He had a strong suspicion that a particular young woman, his daughter in fact, who was married and lived next door, had stolen the money. He accordingly accused her</page><page sequence="28">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. of the deed. But as she refused to confess, and stoutly and persist- ently denied the charge, her father proceeded to perform what the Ainu call by the various names of Niwo-ki marapto, " The ceremony of discovery; " Shzitzmbe marapto, " The ceremony of the fox;" or Kema koshneguru miarapto, "The ceremony of the light-footed per- son," the fox being so called on account of the rapidity with which it can get out of one's way. This "ceremony of the fox" is a sort of divination, by means of which the guilt or innocence of an accused person is supposed to be established, and is very closely allied to trial by ordeal. In the present case, however, though the person was brought in guilty, and implicit faith was placed in the decision, there appears to have been a mistake, for shortly afterwards the dollar was found; but it was quite against the father's dignity to tell his daughter so. I verily believe that he was angry to find out that his divination had played him false. Every married Ainu keeps one fox's skull, carefully decorated with willow shavings, stowed away among his treasures in the eastern or sacred end of his hut. With this he divines, should he have lost anything or should something have gone wrong in any other way with him. In such a case he takes the skull from its corner and, after having prayed over it and told it all his troubles, asks it to make known to him the cause. Should the spirit of the skull be favor- able, it will show him the whole matter in a dream. The ceremony concerning which I am now speaking was con- ducted as follows: The accused person was brought into the hut of her father and made to sit in front of him. He then produced his fox's skull, prayed before it, told it of his loss, and asked it to favor him by answering truly. He next separated the lower jaw from the rest of the skull. The top part of the skull, which is called sapa num, was reverently put on one side, and the jaw placed upon his head, teeth upwards. He then gently leant forward so as to allow the jaw to gradually slip to the floor. As it fell with the teeth to the ground his daughter was thereby proved guilty; but should it have fallen with the teeth upwards she would have been declared innocent. The person proved guilty was called Ko-niwokguru, "the person pointed out" or discovered. Should it have happened, however, that the loser of the money had no suspicion as to the thief, he would have tied a long piece of string to the skull, and, having gathered up the string in a bunch in his hand, would have caused an assembly of people whom he sus- pected each to take one piece of the string and all pull together. He who took the piece immediately attached to the skull would have been the person "pointed out" as the culprit. It is needless to add that the Ainu have implicit confidence in this 42</page><page sequence="29">Items of Ainu Folk-Lore. curious ceremony, though it does play them false sometimes. I should also remark that many Ainu men, when going on a long jour- ney, reverently carry a fox skull among their luggage; with this they divine, and determine which way to take or which of two things should be done next. (i) Objection to being Photographed. It was an old belief among the Ainu - a belief which has now almost entirely died out in Yezo -that by being sketched or photo- graphed, especially when in a naked condition, their natural life was thereby shortened in some mysterious way or other. The term the people use with reference to this is Ainu katu ehange, "the man draws nigh to his form; " and that is like saying "death is at hand" or "the man is becoming a ghost." Even so late as the year I890 a gentleman travelling in Yezo had his sketch-block taken away by some Ainu because he was sketching them when they were nearly naked. The people appeared to see something uncanny in having their mere form produced without the substance. To speak of the form of a person is often equivalent to speaking of his soul, spirit, or ghost. Hence to produce a person's form on paper was consid- ered to be like drawing the soul out of him and placing it in an un- natural position, and the man himself was henceforth supposed to be gradually shadowing off into mere physical form without material substance. In short, the Ainu appeared to think that by having his photograph taken a person was thereby being transformed into a ghtost before his time. The person I have just referred to is not the only one who has in- advertently got into trouble in this way. Mr. B. Douglas Howard, who travelled in. Saghalien for a short time, has given us his experi- ences among the Ainu who dwell there. In his book, which is en- titled "Trans-Siberian Savages," I find two passages which illustrate the point under discussion, though he does not appear to be aware of the reasons for this Ainu aversion to the camera. I now quote from that book the two passages I refer to. On page 95 we find that Mr. Howard brought out his hand-mirror for the inspection of the people. He says: "This to my astonishment quickly pro- duced exactly the effect my rifle failed to accomplish. As fast as I showed them their faces, they darted like arrows to the doorway, and nothing could induce them to come back. I didn't wonder at it," etc. Evidently Mr. Howard thought that it was their own filth or ugliness they were afraid of. But he should have looked deeper than that, for it would be unnatural for them to consider themselves, brought up as they are, either dirty or ugly, whatever Mr. Howard may have thought of their looks. The fact, however, is explained 43</page><page sequence="30">47ournal of American Folk-Lore. by the Ainu words, Ainu katu ehange, "the man draws nigh to his form." On page 96 Mr. Howard says:- In a very quiet way I had taken a good many carefully selected snap- shots with my camera, which included the old chief, the wizard, and several other portraits. Thinking I would like to add to their pleasure another en- tirely new surprise and sensation, and also, perhaps, to impress them still further with my own wonderful powers, I took an almost endless amount of trouble to develop a few of them, especially the portraits. Of these the only one now in my possession is the portrait of the old chief. The worst part of it is that my loss of the others is due to a calamity which with such immense pains I myself innocently brought about. One day, when several men were in the hut with the chief, I took the opportunity to attempt a surprise, and watch the effect upon them as I dis- played before them their newly finished portraits. Instantly they sprang to their feet as if they had been shot. All except the chief rushed out of the hut as if in a rage. The old chief stamped up and down the hut in the greatest distress. Hearing a great hubbub mixed with wild cries outside, I went to the hut door, where I found these people, whose gentle virtues I have so faithfully depicted, raving and gesticulating in the most menacing manner. To my utter consternation I saw that some of them were bran- dishing sticks, some of them knives, -that, indeed, one and all were sud- denly changed to savages of the wildest type. Utterly bewildered at this sudden change of affairs, yet assuming that the pictures must have in some way been the cause of it, and remembering as I did the effect of the looking-glass upon them, I appealed as well as I could to the chief, exhibited my regret, and tried to make him understand that I placed myself and everything I had in his hands. To make a clean breast of it, I brought out my pictures, my apparatus, and everything that pertained to it, and offered to put them all into the fireplace, but there was no fire. Meanwhile the people outside grew so violent that the chief was obliged to go out to them. After a long parley, the chief returned and made me understand that I must carry everything outside. As fast as they could do it, a big fire was kindled in front of the hut. Inaos were stuck in the ground all around the fire, and following their intimations, while they stood back as if in great- est alarm, I threw my poor kodak, my pictures, all my apparatus on the fire, and stood there calmly looking on till nothing was left of them but ashes. I have heard it stated that these people, among other races (take the Chinese for example) who object to being sketched or photo- graphed, do so because they fancy that life will only last as long as the photograph or sketch. But is not the idea contained in the Ainu expression, "the man draws nigh to his form," really the reason? It seems to me to be so. 7ohn Batchelor. SAPPORO, JAPAN. 44</page></plain_text>
