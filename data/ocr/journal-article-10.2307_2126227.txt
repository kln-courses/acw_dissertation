<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FALLACY OF ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE Herbert McClosky University of Minnesota Perhaps no development of modern times has created so serious a dilemma for the theory and practice of democratic government as the rise of the totalitarian mass party. This type of party is distin- guished by the fact that, while it is eager to exploit the opportunities afforded by the democratic process for persuasion and vote-seeking, it is nevertheless dedicated to a set of goals which, if attained, would destroy that process. The dilemma now presents itself on at least two levels: First, is a democratic system obligated to make available the channels of participation even to parties whose undeniable objec- tive is the destruction of the democratic process? And second, are democrats obligated to recognize as legitimate a government con- trolled by a totalitarian mass party that has succeeded in attaining office by clear majority vote? This paper will deal with the second of these questions, although it is recognized that the questions are closely related and that an analysis of one of them will necessarily have bearing upon the other. The problem of the obligations required by the principle of ma- jority rule will arise in coming European elections as it has already arisen in the recent Italian elections where, for a time, it appeared that the Communists might gain a majority of the votes cast. In the face of that possibility, western democratic opinion exhibited a con- fusion that disclosed, as the textbooks have never succeeded in do- ing, the profound uncertainty that attends the understanding of the majority principle. For, underlying the fear that the Communists might win the election was a tentative yet disturbing belief that the commitment to majority rule might compel democrats, both inside and outside of Italy, to recognize as a government-by-right even the dictatorship that the Communists would most certainly have estab- lished. Implicitly, those who held this belief were subscribing to a theory of political obligation - best designated perhaps as the theory of absolute majority rule-that is not without support in the litera- [637 J</page><page sequence="2">638 THE JOURNAL OF' POLITICS [Vol. 11 ture of political theory.' Essentially, this theory maintains (a) that a majority is, in a democracy, the highest authority, and its vote must therefore be final and absolutely binding; (b) that being the highest authority, no limits can logically be placed upon its power; and (c) that democracy and majority rule are, therefore, one and the same thing. It is the burden of this paper to analyze the principle of majority rule and to demonstrate that a view of the majority principle which conceives the power of a majority as absolute is untenable on the ground that it does violence both to democracy and to logic. By way of attaining this, it will be necessary to examine the case for ma- jority rule, to suggest the limitations that need to be imposed upon it, and to advance the empirical as well as the formal theoretical considerations which lead to a rejection of majority power conceived as absolute. The principle of majority rule derives its status as an essential corollary of democratic theory from its association with the doctrine of popular sovereignty. The belief that the governed must be able to choose and to bring to account those who exercise authority has been characteristic of democratic thought throughout its modern his- tory. Since every man, says Locke, is naturally free, nothing is "able to put him into subjection to any earthly power, but only his own consent. ."2 - an opinion, the latter part of which, at least, has been reiterated by almost every democratic thinker from Locke's days to ours. The doctrine of popular sovereignty is, under democ- racy, made operationally meaningful through the implementation of 'Cf., for example, H. Krabbe, The Modern Idea of the State (New York, 1927), pp. 74-82; J. Allen Smith, The Spirit of American Government (New York, 1912), Chs. 13-14. In such works on the subject as H. S. Commager, Majority Rule and Minority Rights (New York, 1943), and especially Edwin Mims, Jr., The Majority of the People (New York, 1941), the final power of the majority is apparently supported, but the problem whether any limitations may be required of the majority is not clearly faced. Willmoore Kendall makes out both Locke and Rousseau as supporters, however inconsistent, of un- restricted majority rule in John Locke and the Doctrine of Majority-Rule (Urbana, 1941). 2John Locke, Of Civil Government (J. M. Dent and Sons, London, 1924), p. 177.</page><page sequence="3">1949] THE FALLACY or ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE 639 the principle of consent and its twin principle, accountability. Con- sent and accountability are, in turn, made practicable through the implementation of the principle of majority rule. The case for majority rule as a technique to make possible the accountability of rulers rests, first of all, on a set of postulates that have been implicit in virtually all theories of democracy. The first of these postulates is that man is either an end unto himself, or exists for purposes designed by God, but that in either case political and social arrangements exist to serve him, and not the reverse. The second is, that since, in civil affairs, each man must be regarded as an end, all men must therefore be accounted, for political and legal purposes, as equal. From this, a third postulate derives, namely, that all men being accounted as equal, the opinion (i.e., the vote) of each must, regarding his governance, be equal with that of every other man. Fourth, since every man is an end in himself, and the equal of every other man, those who govern him must do so as his agents- must do so, that is, with his consent - which requires, of course, that he can choose and remove them. Finally, if governance must rest on the principle of agency, and each man's vote regarding his governance must be accorded equal weight with that of every other man, the agent attaining the greatest number of votes cast shall be con- sidered the popular choice and empowered either to make or enforce laws binding upon the entire citizenry.3 Fifty-plus-one must, then, take precedence over forty-nine, since this postulate assumes that the larger of these figures is, at the moment, the best possible ap- proximation of the popular temper. Over and above this set of postulates - largely a priori in char- acter -a number of empirical judgments may be adduced in be- half of majority rule. It can, first of all, be pointed out that ac- countability is possible only where the rulers are chosen by the gov- erned, for there is no effective way of implementing responsibility except choice.4 Where the exercise of power is sanctioned by birth, 3Where there are only two candidates, the "greatest number" will, of course, always be a majority. In practice, however, there are frequently more than two, in which case a plurality is regarded as the closest approximation of the popular will. 4The "appointment" of certain administrative and judicial officers does not affect this judgment, since they are appointed by those who have been chosen, and, though indirectly, are nevertheless ultimately responsible to the voters.</page><page sequence="4">640 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 11 class, property, co-optation, force or any other principle except pop- ular choice, the governed are, in effect, not consulted, and ac- countability is largely precluded. Now, it is clear that the exercise of choice, where each partici- pant is regarded as equal, requires - by virtue of arithmetic neces- sity - that either a majority or a minority shall prevail, unless, of course, unanimity is wanted. Where, however, unanimity is aban- doned as unlikely or impossible of attainment, either more than half the equal members or less than half must be taken as potentially cap- able of settling the outcome of a given election. If the outcome is to be decided by less-than-half, one is presented with the difficulty that no grounds can be consistently established-where, for example, several minorities compete - by which one minority can claim to take precedence over another. If it is a minority that is to decide, then all minorities have an equal claim. Hence, "minority rule" ef- fectively precludes choice and renders accountability impossible. Moreover, it is obvious that minority determination is inconsistent with the postulates we have indicated as inherent in all democratic systems. We said that each member of a democratic polity must be accounted as equal. Yet, to give to a minority final competence is to give special significance to its members, i.e., to treat its members not as the equals of other men, but as their superiors. Similarly, the opinions they hold and the votes they cast are weighted differ- ently from those of other men. Where, in addition, power resides finally in a minority, the authorization of government must rest not on consent, but on some arbitrary category of qualities enjoyed by that minority, like property or caste. Any minority that pre- sumes to claim final power must, in effect, be self-appointed. For if it is not self-appointed, it is chosen; if it is chosen, it must be responsible to a majority; and if it is responsible to a majority, it cannot presume to claim final power. The empirical argument against lodging final power in a minority has, from the point of view of democratic values, still other aspects. Governments that are self-appointed or accountable to a privileged minority exhibit characteristic traits of behavior that contravene, in their results, the purposes to which democracy is dedicated. Such governments are, for example, invariably self-perpetuating and oligarchical, and hence callous to the needs and wishes of the gov- erned. Since they cannot but be founded on privilege, it is privilege</page><page sequence="5">1949] THE FALLACY o' ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE 641 that they will generally serve. Such governments are likely, also, to read the interests of the governed in the image of their own special interests, accounting what is good for themselves as necessarily good for the rest of men. They will, as a rule, be unable, even with the best will in the world, to ascertain and weigh properly the true needs and wants of the governed, since, being oligarchical, they cannot permit the free expression of popular opinion, and, being privileged, they cannot successfully identify with those who are without privi- lege. The tendency of minority power is, moreover, generally sup- pressive and often tyrannical. That it will also be biased in favor of those upon whose sanction its power rests is sufficiently attested to by the history of such governments. It becomes clear, then, that minority rule is, so far as democratic values are concerned, quite unacceptable. And given the dichotomy indicated above, a demo- cracy becomes inconceivable without the presence of the majority rule principle. These arguments, more or less clearly articulated and understood, have provided the grounds for the belief in majority rule and have helped, thereby, to bring western democrats to the state of anxiety they exhibited in the face of a possible Communist majority in Italy. That they should have this effect is understandable, for they are persuasive, and so far as they go, cogent. They beg, however, the important questions of how the majority rule principle must be in- terpreted, and what limitations, if any, this principle allows us to place upon a majority or its government. III It may seem from the foregoing that, by positing a necessitous choice between majority and minority rule, and in rejecting the latter, the case for the absolute power of the majority has been con- ceded. This conclusion would, however, be unwarranted, for it re- mains now to define the majority principle and to determine whether or not the power of a majority must, under this principle, be quali- fied both in theory and practice. The theoretical argument against a definition of the majority principle which grants unlimited power to the majority rests, to begin with, on the simple fact that it gives to a majority, or its</page><page sequence="6">642 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 11 government, the power to dispose of the rules that have given the majority its legitimate power in the first place. The legitimate power of a majority to rule in a democracy derives ultimately, as we have seen, from the necessity for establishing some procedure by which the will of the community may be assumed to be most closely ap- proximated. Such a procedure obviously demands the elaboration of a set of rules, in order that the determination of what is assumed to be the proximate community will shall rest not on caprice but on an arrangement known and agreed to by all. The most important of these rules, and in fact the one under which all the other rules may be subsumed, is the rule that the majority must be freely-arrived-at, i.e., the opportunity must be kept open for individuals to form them- selves, for legal purposes, into majorities, and ipso facto, into minori- ties. Where this opportunity is destroyed, the majority principle is itself destroyed. What are some of the other rules that may be subsumed under the rule that majorities must be freely-arrived-at? In general, they are the rules that embody the political rights traditionally associ- ated with democratic thought and practice. In order for individ- uals freely to form themselves into majorities and/or minorities, they must, for example, be free to speak and publish and criticize, to assemble and to associate. Where representative government is involved - as it invariably is in modern democracies - the rules require that they shall be free to choose and remove their rulers, and this presupposes, among other things, that they shall be free to cast their lot with the "government" or the opposition, to form parties, to choose among candidates and parties, to participate, in short, in free elections. It is in such terms that the majority principle must be defined, for only if opportunity exists for majorities freely to determine their governance (and, hence, to dispose freely of a given gov- ernment and replace it with another) can the principle of majority rule be made consistent with itself, as well as with democracy.5 It cannot be defined consistently if it grants to any majority the legi- timate power to prevent the realization of new majorities, or if it grants to a government, elected by a majority, the power to forbid 'Cf. R. M. MacIver, The Web of Government (New York, 1947), pp. 198-9, for the view that democracy cannot be conceived apart from such political freedoms as we have described.</page><page sequence="7">1949] THE FALLACY or ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE 643 even that same majority from holding accountable the agents it has elected. There can be nothing in the majority principle that requires that a majority should have the power to destroy it, for it is the very nature of a principle that it prohibits its own negation. Moreover, such power as a majority enjoys derives precisely from the majority principle, and when that principle ceases to prevail, the legitimate power of the majority must cease also. On logical grounds alone, then, it becomes apparent that a majority, deriving its sanc- tion from the principle of majority rule, is limited by that principle to the extent, at least, that it cannot abrogate the rules which au- thorize the power it can properly exercise. It is not difficult to demonstrate, either, that the principle of majority rule can be made consistent with democracy only if it is de- fined as setting certain limits upon the majority.6 In the first place, to interpret the majority principle as requiring the unlimited author- ity of a majority is to preclude the possibility of limited govern- ment and to insist, in effect, that not only are there no proper limi- tations on political power, but that those who hold power may, if they like, prohibit recourse against its exercise. We need hardly be reminded that modern democracy began as a protest against unlim- ited authority and the power of absolute rulers to exclude from the political process those whom they marked as dissidents. If, by virtue of its majority support, a government can legitimately pro- hibit the formation of an opposition, and forbid those who dis- agree to speak and publish, it can hardly be claimed that a democ- racy exists. Otherwise we should have had to account Nazi Germany a democracy if, instead of receiving thirty-three per cent of the votes, the Nazis had attained, in 1932, fifty-one per cent. This is, of course, preposterous, just as it would be absurd to maintain that Soviet Russia or Fascist Italy are examples of (1) majority rule systems, and (2) democracies, because their governments attained huge majorities in popular elections. What makes spurious the claim of a modern totalitarian dictatorship to call itself democratic is largely the fact that it denies the majority principle as we have 'The equation of democracy with majority rule is not uncommon in the literature. Cf., for example, Smith. op. cit.; Max Lerner, "Minority Rule and the Constitutional Tradition," in Conyers Read (ed.), The Constitution Recon- sidered (New York, 1938); Mims, op. cit.</page><page sequence="8">644 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. II defined it.7 For if we define it as setting no limits upon the majority, we are compelled to admit that a dictatorial regime receiving ma- jority support - either at its inception or subsequently - is in fact a majority rule system, and hence, presumably, a democracy. A definition of the majority principle that makes it possible to in- clude within the category of majority rule systems the divergent governments of England and Russia, or Sweden and Argentina,- that cannot, in short, distinguish a dictatorship from a democracy- is not only inadequate but self-evidently absurd. The argument with which we are concerned here is in some ways like the argument that democrats have traditionally had with po- litical thinkers of the Hobbesian school. It will be recalled that, for Hobbes, consent, once granted, became irrevocable, binding future generations for eternity, despite even the exercise of tyranny by the Sovereign. The Sovereign, once elected, was free to define or limit, however he pleased, the rights and duties of the citizenry. The origi- nal grant of consent was taken by Hobbes to justify the unqualified power of the Sovereign; nothing could require him to make available to the governed the opportunity to deliver themselves from his power.8 Against this, democrats have always insisted that consent is, by its very nature, revocable; that it must be periodically renewed; that a grant made by the father cannot bind the sons; that, in effect, the power of government must be limited at least by the require- ment that the right to withdraw or renew consent cannot be annulled. Were we to cast our argument in the language of the social com- pact school, we would contend that, under the principle of majority rule, the denial by a majority or its government of the basic political liberties that make consent possible is a violation of the compact and destroys the polity. The majority cannot, like Hobbes' Sovereign, violate the compact (i.e., the rules) that gives justification to its power. The "compact" implicit in every democratic system is that the majority shall prevail providing it observes tke rules which 7Some scholars have held that modern dictatorships are frequently majority rule systems, but regard this as proof that democracy and majority rule are not equivalent. See, for example, R. M. Maclver, Leviathan and the People (Baton Rouge, 1939), pp. 66-7. If, however, we talk of the majority principle, and define it as we have above, a dictatorship could not be regarded as a majority rule system. 8Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan.</page><page sequence="9">1949] THE FALLACY or ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE 645 gave it, initially, the right to govern. This is clearly recognized by Locke (as well as by other compact theorists) who, though he says at one point that "every man, by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to every one of that society to submit to the determination of the majority, and to be concluded by it,"9 nevertheless makes clear that consent must be ever renewed, which presupposes, of course, freedom. Moreover, for Locke, civil society is conceived as a means of pro- tecting certain rights that are difficult to defend in the state of na- ture. Notice, too, such passages in Locke as the following: For since it can never be supposed to be the will of the society that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure by entering into society, and for which the people submitted themselves to legislators of their own making: whenever the legislators endeavour to take away and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience, and are left to the common refuge which God hath provided for all men against force and violence. Whensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society, and either by ambition, fear, folly, or corruption, endeavour to grasp them- selves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people, by this breach of trust they for- feit thie power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to resume their original liberty, and by the establishment of a new legislative (such as they shall think fit), provide for their own safety and security, which is the end for which.they are in society.10 Was Locke contradicting himself by endorsing majority rule while at the same time viewing the majority, or its legislators, as limited? Not necessarily, for what is endorsed is not the power of a pass- ing majority or its government to bind absolutely and eternally, but, rather, the power of a government, elected by a majority, to make laws within a Jramework of rules established, and/or agreed to, by all. Also, Locke seems implicitly to recognize that majority rule can be made consistent with the purposes it is designed to serve (namely, an approximation of the community will in order to protect the "lives, liberties and estates of the people") only if limitations 'John Locke, op. cit., p. 165. "John Locke, 9p. cit., pp. 228-229 (my italics). Perhaps the most searching analysis of Locke's majoritarian views will be found in Kendall. op. cit.</page><page sequence="10">646 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 11 exist that forbid the majority or its government from contravening these purposes. If Locke errs in his understanding of the limitations a demo- cratic society imposes upon its legislators, the error lies in his failure to distinguish political freedoms, such as the freedom to participate in the choice of rulers, from non-political freedoms, like those often claimed for property or religion. The principle of majority rule recognizes no limitations on the power of the majority or its gov- ernment except those that are essential to the attainment of freely- arrived-at majorities and to the maintenance of political consent and accountability. Freedoms associated with property, like, for ex- ample, freedom of contract, are from the point of view of the majority principle of an entirely different order from, let us say, the freedoms to speak and publish. The latter are political freedoms, without which a majority rule system is impossible; they cannot, therefore, be legitimately abridged. Freedom of contract, on the other hand, may, so far as the majority principle is concerned, be regulated and controlled in whatever fashion the majority or its gov- ernment deems best. Whether industry shall be nationalized or pri- vately owned; whether wages shall be set by government or by pri- vate contract; whether polygamy shall be permitted within a mono- gamous society - these are matters that a democratic government, operating under majority rule, can, if it likes, control. It cannot, however, properly determine whether political criticism will be toler- ated or whether elections should be abolished, for the right to oppose and the right to elect are among those political freedoms from which its power derives.1' Empirically, of course, it would be folly for a democratic government to limit seriously the exercise of freedom in any matter about which the community feels strongly. It may be, too, that such matters as freedom of worship can be secured against governmental control by some principle other than the majority principle. It needs, however, to be made clear that while the ma- jority principle imposes restraints on majority power, it does not sanction freedom from any sort of control. On the contrary, it "1A democratic government may, and, of course, does adopt regulations that affect these rights. Such regulations are consistent with democracy and the majority principle, however, only if their over-all result is to secure the conditions under which these rights may be equitably enjoyed. The rights themselves, however, cannot be denied.</page><page sequence="11">1949] THE FALLACY OF ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE 647 authorizes the exercise of power, except over those matters upon which the authorization itself depends. Other matters that claim immunity from control must seek their sanction elsewhere. IV We have, so far, been examining the theoretical arguments against absolute majority rule. It remains now to take notice of some of the "practical" considerations that support the view of the majority principle that has been advanced here. While we have employed, in the course of this analysis, the phrase, "majority rule," it is important that we recognize the misleading suggestion contained in that phrase, i.e., the suggestion that ma- jorities do in fact rule or govern. On the contrary, in all modern polities it is governments, and not majorities, that actually rule. Moreover, since governments are invariably minorities, the responsi- bility for running the affairs of a modern state falls largely to a minority in whose charge the offices of government are placed. What- ever it is a majority may appear to want requires for its implementa- tion a government. Hence, to speak of a majority as being unlimited signifies operationally the grant of unlimited power to the minority that has gained access to the offices of government. The argument for absolute majority rule reduces itself at the level of practice to the endorsement of absolute governmental power by a minority. The characteristic democratic arguments against unlimited gov- ernmental power are as cogent today as ever, and, given the enormous complexity of modern mass society, far more applicable. To sug- gest to a modern government that there are no proper limits on its power is to invite it to use, and, most likely, to abuse that power. Oligarchical tendencies are invariably present, as Michels has so brilliantly demonstrated,12 in even the most democratic governments. It is in the nature of power to seek generally to augment itself, as is clearly evident from the history of governments, and the most important brake on this tendency is, in the last analysis, the under- standing - among both rulers and governed - that power must be 12Robert Michels, Political Partks; A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy (New York, 1915).</page><page sequence="12">648 THE JOURNAL 0 POLITICS [Vol. 11 contained within agreed and fairly defined limits. Where the under- standing is otherwise, there is little to check the self-aggrandizing tendencies of political power except the partisan consciences of those who hold it. It is precisely the recognition that a partisan con- science is inadequate security against the abuse of power that ac- counts for the dependence, in modern democracies, upon constitu- tions. Constitutions are the instruments by which communities formally define and delimit the powers of government to which they will be subject. Unlimited authority - when placed in a gov- ernment or, nominally, in the majority that lies behind - is the negation, therefore, of constitutionalism, rendering it impossible. What is even more important, however, is that democracy becomes impossible in practice where no rules are understood to delimit power. What of the contention, sometimes offered against this view, that we must trust the majority to delimit itself, to establish the rules and abide them? The first difficulty inherent in this contention is that the majority is, for practical purposes, unable to delimit itself, since the majority does not in fact act. Again, it is governments that act, and what we in effect ask, when we assert this proposition, is that governments be trusted to judge their own powers. There are, more- over, a number of pertinent facts about majorities as such, and their relationship to government, that this contention overlooks: The term majority refers, at its simplest level, to a mere arithme- tical quality, namely, more-than-half. Political theorists have often, however, proceeded toward this term as though it implied something more: they have, in fact, infused the term with qualities it does not necessarily possess. There is a tendency, for example, to think of the majority as though it were (a) homogeneous, and (b) organic in its character. The arithmetical abstraction, majority, has, like so many other abstractions in politics, been reified and then proceeded to- ward as though it were a single anthropomorphic entity. The fact is, however, that a majority is neither organic nor usually homogeneous. On the contrary, there are frequently as wide differences in attitude and opinion among various members of "the majority" as there are between some members of the majority and some members of the minority. Under the American party system, for example, it is in- deed likely that the candidates attaining majorities will have drawn support from virtually every section of opinion in the community. To assign, therefore, to so ambiguous an entity as the "majority" the</page><page sequence="13">1949] THE FALLACY oi0 ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE 649 ultimate power to determine without limitation the very foundations of the polity, is to sacrifice reality for formality. We have fallen into the habit, too, of assuming that we must proceed toward the majority as though it were always right; as though there were some sanctity it enjoyed in matters of morality and truth. This grows out of the honorific status enjoyed by "the people" in democratic doctrine. Having hit upon the majority as the best possible working approximation of "the people," we have subtly transferred to the majority the quality of infallibility that democratic theory assigns to the people. Realistically, however, we must recognize that the infallibility of "the people" is, like the so- cial compact and other such concepts, an operational myth, necessary, perhaps, as a theoretical presupposition, but hardly supportable empirically. "The people" cannot be infallible for the simple reason that the people is frequently divided. Nor, a fortiori, can a ma- jority be so regarded, for not only is it also divided in numerous respects, but it represents at best only a crude approximation of "the people." When it is said that the majority is always "right," what pre- cisely does this mean? Obviously, it cannot mean that the majority always has the correct answers to social problems and issues that are posed to it since (1) different members of any given majority will invariably have a number of different answers to the same problem; and (2) it is obvious from our experience that some members of "the minority" have, on some questions, far more knowledge and in- sight than do many of those who happen to have voted with "the ma- jority." Given the wide possibility of error in judgments about complex human affairs, we may certainly doubt that a case can invariably be made for the absolute superiority of the judgments of any 50.1 per cent over those of the 49.9 per cent. Suppose, however, that by "right" in this instance is meant that the majority always knows its own best interest and will act accordingly. Here again, however, we have a proposition that is empirically indefensible, for it is evident that not only do majority opinions sometimes shift back and forth on public questions and candidates (often, too, within brief spaces of time), but majorities suffer, often, the election of gov- ernments whose concern is primarily with the maintenance of estab- lished privilege and the dominant interests of powerful minorities. Any realistic discussion of this problem must face the fact, too,</page><page sequence="14">650 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 11 that it has become exceedingly difficult, under the complex condi- tions of modern mass society, to choose courses wisely, or to dis- cover one's best interest and find the means for its implementation. Considering the vast complexity of social issues, the difficulty of gaining insight into them, the enormous increase in governmental functions, the degree of specialization that is required to handle ef- fectively the greatly augmented power of modern government - con- sidering these, the opinion of the majority is at best an inadequate guide (even assuming that all who vote for the same set of candi- dates hold the same opinions, which they rarely do) to the discov- ery of the most efficacious social policy. There is, perhaps, no better guide, or at least no systematic method for producing better guides, but this should not blind us to the deficiencies that inhere in the guides and methods we do deem best. Consider, also, the difficulties that attend our representative system. The voter in a modern democratic polity finds himself con- fronted with a number of huge party organizations, over which he has little control, and which present to him candidates he often does not know, has never seen, and is likely not to learn much about. To assume that there is a necessary consonance between his wants and desires and what he is likely to get from the candidate he votes for, is to mistake the myth for the realtity. He may even find that, in terms of his social beliefs, all the candidates are objectionable, and his problem becomes, so far as he views it, a choice among evils. While there is, to be sure, a tendency for a party that seeks to win elections to respond ultimately to the temper of the many, it some- times misreads that temper, and where it correctly gauges that tem- per, it resorts, not infrequently, to assuaging it by demagogy rather than action. Once elected, a candidate may go his way largely un- observed, and whether or not he can succeed in being reelected may depend on variables quite irrelevant to his merits as a representa- tive of the popular will. His election or reelection will in part be correlated with such extraneous factors as voice, personality, appear- ance, religion, national origins, and party label. It becomes exceedingly difficult, in the light of all this, to inter- pret correctly the meaning of an election and to ascertain, with con- fidence, what it is the majority seems to have expressed when it se- lects one set of candidates over another. Where the issues them- selves are complicated, unclear, and not adequately understood, and</page><page sequence="15">1949] THE FALLACY OF ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE 651 where, in any case, they constitute only one of the variables upon which the outcome of the election depends, no one can be cer- tain what mandate, if any, the majority of the electorate has granted to its governors. Unfortunately, no better way is known to attain political accountability than to allow voters to select freely by what- ever standards they deem important. To assume, however, that a government elected by a majority is justified, in the name of that majority, to exercise power unqualifiedly and to be made custodian of the very rules from which its power derives, is, in the face of the empirical considerations we have indicated, to fall victim to the dread formalism that seems so frequently to accompany theoretical systems.13 Given these considerations, it becomes clear that there must exist in a democracy the opportunity to undo what previous majori- ties and their governments have done, for it must be granted that with the inevitable hiatus between the governed and their representa- tives, the complexity of issues, the difficulty of interpretating the meaning of an election, etc., -the potentiality for error, and even evil, has become, under the representative system, real. Nothing, either in its definition or operation, requires that democracy so trust its governors as to empower them to prevent the undoing of their work. It is very well to indulge ready aphorisms such as "Democ- racy is founded on trust." So, perhaps, in a sense, it is. To trust a majority or its government is, however, one thing; to render it in- fallible, another. It is precisely because of its recognition that in- fallibility is not to be anticipated in human affairs that democracy insists on accountability and on keeping open the road to the cor- rection of error. If the justification for government rests on the fact that men are not angels, the case for democracy and the majority principle resides in the fact that there are no Philosopher-Kings (and that even if there were, we should have no means of discov- ering them except by election). It is the essence of the majority principle that it insists that no one can be trusted with absolute pow- er, not even half-plus-one of the people. We must, then, recognize "8John Stuart Mill, in support of his case for proportional representation, has indicated still other empirical difficulties associated with the operation of majority rule.

On the contrary, the ma- jority principle insists, as we have seen, on the recognition of limita- tions on the rule of the majority or its government. It should also be clear from this that, on grounds both of theory and practice, democracy cannot be defined as merely the rule of the majority. The most that can be claimed is that majority rule, when limited by the majority principle as we have defined it, is a neces- sary, but not a sufficient condition for the existence of a democracy. Left unrestricted, majority rule must be regarded as a sufficient con- dition for democracy since if democracy is defined as equivalent with the absolute power of the majority, no other conditions, such as ac- countability or political freedom, are logically necessary to, nor can they enter into, the definition. Yet it is obvious from the actual history, as well as from the articulated theory, of democracy that it cannot be conceived apart from political freedom or from account- ability. To limit the majority does not mean that the minority shall be sovereign. Rather does it mean, in a democracy, that the minority that governs shall be empowered by a majority to act for a limited period of time within a framework of rules, established formally or traditionally, to which the community, in general, adheres. If we turn once again to experience, we shall discover that in virtually all modern democracies, (a) majority rule exists in some form, and (b) in even the clearest majority rule systems, it is never assumed that the power of the majority or its government is absolute and un- qualified. The formal dichotomy, i.e., that either a majority or a minority must finally rule, fails to take into account the fact that, in practice, democracies have organized themselves so that neither majorities nor minorities have absolute power. Both are limited, though the majority, of course, prevails, or can prevail if it wishes, in those matters over which it has legitimate authority. All modern democracies have managed to make clear - either by specific con- stitutional limitation, by institutional checks, or most important, by the development of an ethos which requires that the rules of the game be respected - that there are certain things a government, no matter how wide its support, simply cannot do. Even in England, where, ex-</page><page sequence="17">1949] THE FALLACY OF ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE 653 cept for the remaining powers of the monarch and the House of Lords, there are no formal limitations on the majority of the House of Commons, it is nevertheless understood by virtually all who partici- pate in or are subject to the political process that governmental power is limited and that actions which infringe the rules that make possible majority government cannot be abided. It is no accident that docu- ments such as Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights of 1689 hold an honored place, even a constitutional status, in British law. Nor is it mere chance that those who sit opposite the Treasury Bench are desig- nated the "Official Opposition," and that their leader is even paid a salary for "helping to make a Government possible." It would be utterly inconceivable to an Englishman that his commitment to the principle of majority rule would require him to recognize as legitimate an act by the Government that abolished, for example, all opposition. It would be no less inconceivable to the members of the Government itself that such powers might legitimately be assigned to them. The formalist, pointing to the fact that the constitution can in England be amended by mere statute, might insist that a government elected by a majority is therefore unlimited. This would be, however, to mis- take the form for the substance. It is an occupational bias of lawyers, and of some political scientists, that what- lacks formal legal status appears to them to lack also existence. Experience, however, compels us to recognize this bias as spurious and inadmissible. Mi we, ae CQ^rect in believing that the principle of majority rule requires the existence of those rights that make democracy piss%;&amp;e, then democrats would not, under this principle, be bound to recog- nize as legitimate the regimes that totalitarian parties may seek to establish in the name of the majority. A regime that will destroy the opposition, abrogate political freedom, or in any other way violate the conditions for the free expression of consent and accountability can rightfully make no claims on the loyalty of democrats, no matter how wide its support. The first obligation of democrats, qua democrats, would be, in fact, not to obey in this instance, but to seek to maintain, wherever they can, the possibility of choice, consent and account- ability, for these are necessary prerequisites for any democracy. Just, for example, as we do not, under democracy, permit a citizen to sell himself into slavery (on the assumption that a man's freedom is the one quality he cannot dispense with as he pleases), so are we not</page><page sequence="18">654 THE JOURNAL 0 POLITICS [Vol. 11 bound to recognize as legitimate the yielding up of freedom by a number of men who happen to constitute an arithmetical quantity of more-than-half. Even more strongly are we bound not to recognize that an attempt by fifty-one percent to relinquish their freedom can obligate the remaining forty-nine percent to do likewise. It may appear a paradox, but democracy, though choice is of its essence, precludes one kind of choice: we cannot, under it, choose not to choose. We cannot, with democratic sanction, choose to cut ourselves off from those requirements that make all choice possible. Therein lies the essential fallacy of absolute majority rule.</page></plain_text>
