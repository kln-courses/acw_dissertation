<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Volume XIX JANUARY 1939 Number 1 SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE' WILBUR M. URBAN HIS topic seems to me to be both timely and of out- standing importance in the present state of theology and the philosophy of religion. It is timely for the reason that the entire question of sym- bolism is much to the fore today in science as well as in other fields. The time is ripe for a general philosophy of symbolism as part of any adequate theory of knowledge. It is of impor- tance for the reason that some theory of religious symbolism is an essential part of any philosophy of religion. The theologian of today should not only have an adequate theory of symbolism and symbolic knowledge but should also see the relation of re- ligious symbolism to other forms, pre-eminently the scientific. It is in the hope of contributing to the realization of these ob- jectives that I have ventured to speak on this topic. I think it would be admitted by all present that, with all the incalculable values which Protestantism has brought to the mod- ern world, it has also brought certain serious disvalues. One of these was the loss of the sense for symbolism. When the re- formers broke the stained-glass windows of cathedrals, they also broke certain very precious windows of the soul. But the loss to the modern world was not merely one of "vision" so to speak; it was also one of understanding. The disastrous literalism of Protestantism arose from two I President's address, delivered before the American Theological Society at its meet- ing in New York, April 22, 1938. I</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION sources. The first is well understood. The exclusive emphasis upon the word, and the supposed necessity of a literal inter- pretation of Holy Scripture, led to a "fundamentalism" the un- happy consequences of which are familiar to all. But there was a second source, even more important and not so well under- stood. Protestantism attached itself more and more to modern science, which (from Newton's time on, and especially in the Victorian epoch) was interpreted as literal truth. Unless, there- fore, theology were interpreted literally, it could not, so it was believed, lay claim to truth. This literalism and fundamental- ism has revenged itself mightily in modern Protestantism, the result being the modernisms and humanisms with which we are all familiar. Catholic theology, on the other hand (using the term in the broadest sense, of course), has never been literal in this sense. For it symbolism has always been a theological principle. It has, for this very reason, I believe, escaped the more disastrous forms of literalism and the modern humanisms which have been the inevitable reactions against such fundamentalism. It is, then, for symbolism as a theological principle that I shall argue in this paper. This means not merely that the fact of symbolism in religion shall be more or less grudgingly admitted but rather that a theory of religious symbolism shall be specifically recog- nized as an intrinsic part of theology and theological method itself. Let me then state in a preliminary way the main theses of the argument that I shall offer you. They are as follows: i. The language of religion, whether devotional or theologi- cal, is inevitably and necessarily a symbolic language. This symbolic character has been recognized by traditional Chris- tianity. Symbolism is, therefore, a fundamental theological principle. The classical form of this principle, together with its assumptions or presuppositions, is the first object of our study. 2. In contrast to this classical theory we have certain modern- istic theories of religious symbolism, namely, the moral theory 2</page><page sequence="3">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE attributed to Kant, and certain humanistic and pragmatic theories. A critical examination of these theories, together with their assumptions and presuppositions, is the second part of our problem. 3. We have finally the question of the truth of religious sym- bolism. This involves certain subordinate questions, chief of which are (a) that of the relation of the religious to the scien- tific symbol and (b) the question of literal or nonsymbolic re- ligious knowledge. It is here that the problem of "religious realism" appears. I. THE LANGUAGE OF RELIGION A favorite way of approaching the problem of religion today is through the problem of language. An examination of the language of religion and theology has led many modern phi- losophers, especially the so-called logical positivists, to identify it with the language of poetry and to see in it merely an expres- sion of emotion. Now it seems to me that the first condition of the solution of our present problem is a frank acceptance of the element of truth in this position and a careful sifting of truth from falsity. A popular statement, for the American mind at least, is that of Santayana, namely, that "religion and poetry are identical in essence and differ merely in the way they are attached to practical affairs. Poetry is called religion when it intervenes in life and religion poetry when it merely supervenes on life." This is, I consider, an essentially false statement of the relation, but it is plausible because of the element of truth in it. I should say rather that they are similar in language but wholly different in essence. Certainly there is great similarity, if not identity of essence, of religion and poetry. This is seen in a certain community of language. The cry of the psalmist, "All flesh is grass," is equally poetic and religious. The simile, "as a flower of the field so it flourisheth," is both poetic figure and religious insight. Finally, 3</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the highly dramatic "the wind bloweth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more," is a highly poetic way of stating a fact of tremendous religious import. The vis poetica is present in all genuine religious language, only in the case of religion it is heightened and deepened in a peculiar way. It is, so to speak, poetry transposed to another scale. But it is this difference in scale which makes the difference in essence. Reli- gion is, to use Otto's expression, numinous poetry. In his book, The Idea of the Holy, Rudolf Otto has a chapter on what he describes as numinous poetry. The well-known thesis of this book is that the religious consciousness is a unique form of experience characterized by a sense of the numinous which he describes as the mysterium tremendum, the holy or sacred. The "holy" for him is an a priori category, not analyz- able or reducible to other categories, whether existential or moral. He quite rightly finds this element present in all reli- gious language, and as that which distinguishes religious from other poetry. He gives illustrations from various religions-the Hindu, Jewish, and Christian hymns and liturgies-and non- linguistic media of expression, such as art and music. The reli- gious hymn, ode, or lyric shows this element especially, but it is also present in the religious dramatic and epic forms. Now without going into all the moot questions raised by Otto's theory, I think we may accept as certain the fact that, however similar in character the language of religion and the language of ordinary poetry may be, they are fundamentally different in essence and that this difference is to be found pre- cisely at the point indicated by Otto. The language of religion is numinous poetry and it is numinous precisely because the reference of its language is always to the noumenal or the transcendental. Whereas the reference of the language of poetry in the ordinary sense is always to the phenomenal, that of re- ligion is always to the noumenal. In any case we shall take this difference as the starting-point of our analysis.2 2 The words "numinous" and "noumenal" have, of course, wholly differrent etymo- logical origins, but their coincidence can, I think, for our purposes be assumed. 4</page><page sequence="5">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE A. RELIGION AND THE LANGUAGE OF MYTH Part of the modern tendency to identify religion with poetry is the tendency to identify it also with myth. Here, again, we we must recognize that, while there is a relation between the two, there is no identity of essence. In asserting any necessary relation between religion and myth, one is of course constantly open to misunderstanding. The uncritical and dyslogistic view of myth, which practically identifies it with fiction, makes its use dangerous. But I agree with Nicholas Berdyaev (in his Freedom of the Spirit) that "it is high time that we stopped identifying myth with invention, with the illusions of primitive mentality and with anything, in fact, that is essentially opposed to reality. For that is the sense which we give the words myth and mythology in ordi- nary conversation. But behind the myth are concealed the greatest realities, the original phenomena of the spiritual life." I think we may again take it for granted that the essence of this contention is accepted by all critical theologians and phi- losophers. There is no positive religion without mythical ele- ments in the philosophical sense of the term "myth." The farther we follow the religious consciousness to its inmost re- cesses, as well as to its beginnings, the more it is found impos- sible to separate it from the mythical consciousness. If one does attempt to separate them-the belief content from the mythical form in which it is expressed-one has then no longer religion in its actual historical and objective nature, but merely a shad- ow picture and an empty abstraction. Nevertheless-and this is a point often overlooked despite this inseparable interweaving of the content of myth and religion-they are far from being identical. Neither the form nor the spirit is the same. The essential difference appears at this point. The religious form of consciousness shows itself precisely in a changed attitude toward the mythical picture of the world. It cannot do without this picture, for it is in the mythical consciousness that the im- mediate intuition of the meaningfulness of the world was first given. Nor can the religious consciousness express its deepest 5</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION insights without using the language of myth, the story and the parable, as not only Plato but also the religious geniuses of all time have seen. Yet in the religious consciousness the myth acquires a new meaning. It becomes symbolic. Religion makes use of the sensuous pictures and signs, but at the same time knows them to be such. The religious consciousness as such always draws the distinction between mere existence and mean- ing. This point which Cassirer emphasizes so continually through- out his Philosophy of Symbolic Forms is of the utmost impor- tance. It expresses the element of truth in Feuerbach's doctrine of the "indispensable myth," but it is also one of the conditions of understanding the nature and function of religious symbol- ism. The indispensability of myth arises precisely from the fact that the dramatic language of myth is the only form in which the experiences of the spiritual life can be expressed. B. THE LANGUAGE OF THEOLOGY The inevitable relation of the language of religion to that of poetry and myth is evidenced not only in the language of re- ligious devotion but-and this is of fundamental import for our entire argument-in the language of theology. The lan- guage of devotion is primarily lyrical. As it appears in litera- ture it includes the Hebrew psalms, the Vedic hymns, the hymns to Dionysus in the mysteries, the "Veni Creator Spiritus" and the "Ave Maria" of Christian devotion. All have the peculiar numinous quality, ranging all the way from the groveling awe of the primitive to the "Holy, Holy, Holy" of the "Sanctus." But religion in its theological, no less than in its devotional, as- pect must retain its dramatic character if it is to remain re- ligious. The creed and the "dogmatic" theology developed from it never lose therefore some of the characters of poetry. To do so would be to lose the dramatic form of expression, and with it the expression of living experience and reality. To lose the vis 6</page><page sequence="7">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE poetica is at the same time to lose the vis religiosa. It follows therefore that theology-that part of religion which treats (sys- tematically) of the Deity, his nature and attributes-retains, and must retain, this character. For credal belief God exists and has certain attributes and characters; for theology the ques- tion is the grounds for that belief and for the ascription of these characters. For credal belief, God became man; for theology, the question is, Why did God become man? Thus it is that in the two classics of theology, the Proslogium and the Cur Deus Homo of St. Anselm, the thinking never loses the dramatic char- acter of religious language. And this is true of all theology. Theology, as the name indicates, is discourse about God, and no talk of God could ever be in a purely mathematical, logical form. The essentially poetic and dramatic character of all theo- logical language is shown by any analysis of theological language as employed in the classical theological arguments. The truth of these assertions is vividly shown in the important volume of A. O. Lovejoy, entitled The Great Chain of Being. In develop- ing the thesis of this book he makes use of many passages from Western theology. An examination of these passages, which time will not permit me to quote here, would serve to disclose this fundamental character of all theological language. II. RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM: ITS NATURE AND FUNCTION It was necessary to make this examination of the language of religion in order to understand the necessarily symbolic ele- ment in both religion and theology. It seems to me that there are two outstanding facts which must be recognized: (a) that religion loses the vis religiosa when it loses the vis poetica, and (b) that the same is true of theology. The language of theology, no less than of religion, must be dramatic in character. God may be a mathematician (and in a sense he doubtless is) but neither our consciousness of God, nor our science about him, can be expressed in mathematical form. In attempting to understand religious symbolism it is im- 7</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION portant to recognize first of all that there is no form of human language, and therefore no form of human knowledge, which does not contain symbolic elements. A. E. Taylor is entirely right when he says: "I think it actually impossible to describe any real event in language wholly non-symbolic. No language, if I may be pardoned the merely apparent bull, is even approxi- mately free from the symbolic except the artificial language of symbolic logic, and that language is impotent to describe the simplest and most familiar event." Here, indeed, we have the crux of the matter. All language, and a fortiori dramatic language, in which religion alone can speak, is necessarily symbolic. Even science, in so far as it is cosmological in character, must, as H. B. Alexander has shown, also speak this language. Our first problem is, then, to distin- guish the religious symbol from other types, especially the sci- entific. In this task I can do no better than start with the analysis of Hoffding. "It is the character of all symbols," he tells us, "whether scientific, poetic or religious, that ideas or images are taken from the narrower and more intuitable regions of experience and used as expressions for more ideal and universal relations which because of their pervasiveness and ideality, cannot be expressed directly." The religious symbol shares in this general character of all symbols, but displays a fundamental difference which must be made clear. Hoffding finds this difference, first of all, in the unique char- acter of the regions of intuition from which the religious symbols are taken. These he describes as the great fundamental con- trasts of nature and human nature, such as light and darkness, power and weakness, life and death, spirit and matter, love and hate, good and evil. This is the Urspriinglicher Symbolismus, embodied in myth and, as a study of the mythical elements in religious language will show, it is in these symbols that the deepest insights of religion are always expressed.3 But this char- 3 Philosophy of Religion (New York: Macmillan, I906), pp. 70 ff. 8</page><page sequence="9">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE acter of the material does not, as H6ffding recognizes, go to the heart of the difference. This is to be found in their noumenal reference, the numinous character of which we have spoken. As he himself says, considered epistemologically, and not psy- chologically, the religious symbol differs in no way from the metaphysical. It differs only in that its figures are more con- crete, richer in color and more toned with emotion; in short, are more akin to those of poetry. The important point is their metaphysical character. This becomes of significance later, for the classical theory of religious symbolism is, as we shall see, metaphysical. III. SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE THE CLASSICAL STATEMENT With this understanding of the inevitably symbolic character of religion and of the special character of the religious symbol, we are prepared to enter upon the consideration of symbolism as a theological principle. The classical statement of this position, for the Christian re- ligion at least, is to be found in the so-called "Fourfold Method" of symbolic interpretation. It was Christian thought which de- veloped this principle of symbolism for the Western world, but both principle and method had their roots in Hellenic thought and may therefore be properly characterized as representative of developed religion in general. There is a continuous tradi- tion from Plato and Philo, through Origen and Clement, Augus- tine and neo-Platonism, up to its complete statement in medi- eval times. According to this view, religious assertions are symbol sen- tences or propositions, the meaning of which must be expanded or interpreted. There are four stages in this interpretation, or four meanings of the symbol, all of which have their truth- the literal, the allegorical, the tropical or tropological, and the anagogical. The development of these meanings constitutes a progressive interpretation. The method was, as is well known, 9</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION applied primarily to the statements of scripture, more particu- larly the parables and miracles, but it had a universal signifi- cance. This we may describe as symbolism as a religious prin- ciple. It became an established principle that every fact or event in the realm of nature or scriptural record might be conceived as conveying, besides its literal meaning, these three symbolic in- terpretations. The interpretation called allegorical, as the term suggests, had reference primarily to truths of humanity as a whole; the story is an allegory of human life. The tropological applied specifically to the moral lesson that might be learned from the event, the assumption of purpose or teleological mean- ing in nature and history being the underlying postulate of all symbolism. The final truth was that of the anagoge-ultimate truth belonging neither to time nor to space. Analogical truth was essentially metaphysical in character, and ultimately reli- gious and metaphysical truth coincide. The important point in this doctrine of the fourfold interpre- tation, for our purposes at least, is the relative importance in the theory of the last two stages of interpretation-the tropo- logical and the anagogic. The moral significance of the symbol -its meaning for life, both individual and social-has always been stressed in Catholic as well as in Protestant Christianity. Whether religion is poetry or not, it is religion only when it intervenes in life, and its intervention is possible only through its relation to the moral and the practical. This has led, as we shall see, in modern times to a purely moral theory of the reli- gious symbol. But for the classical theory the ultimate stage is the anagogic, which is not only beyond the phenomenal, but beyond the moral in the narrow human sense. Literally, the word anagogic means "leading up to," an eleva- tion of mind to "the things above." The things above in the classical theory are, of course, denizens of the intelligible world, perfect truth, perfect goodness, and perfect beauty which, for Christian theology, constitute the very nature of deity itself. IO</page><page sequence="11">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE Thus for Dante, the "bread of angels" on which the soul feeds is both the Eucharist and the knowledge or wisdom of theology and philosophy. The essential character of the classical theory is then always metaphysical. A. SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE IN ST. THOMAS Thus symbolism is recognized as a theological principle in classical Christian theology. I have developed it, to be sure, only in connection with the Christian religious consciousness, but it is also an essential part of all developed religion as Cassirer has abundantly shown. One of the most important sources for the understanding of symbolism as a theological principle is to be found in St. Thomas' treatise on "The Names of God," which follows in the Summa theologica immediately after the discussion of "How God Is Known to Us." The treatise of the names of God takes up and answers twelve questions, the third of which is of special importance in connection with our present study. It is whether any name can be applied to God in a literal sense. St. Thomas answers this question in the affirmative, but in answering it he makes a dis- tinction of the utmost importance, namely, between the "per- fections themselves" and their "mode of signification." What is signified by the names, good, wise, and so forth, belongs literally to God who is the sum of all perfections; but their mode of signification, e.g., goodness, beauty, wisdom, as they appear in creatures, does not belong properly and strictly to God in whom these perfections are infinite. In this distinction is to be found the essentials of St. Thomas' use of symbolism as a theological principle. The names of God, although they give us an element of nonsymbolic knowledge, nevertheless in their mode of signification are symbolic. What this means, of course, is that while the mode of signification must inevitably be "anthropomorphic," since the values are found first in human experience, because of an analogy of being between us and God, II</page><page sequence="12">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION they correspond to characters intrinsic to the nature of Deity as such.4 This we may describe as the classical form of the anagogic theory. The presupposition of this theory, it is easy to see, is the possibility of some nonsymbolic knowledge of God, a doc- trine of religious realism of some sort. There are, of course, two possibilities here and both are represented in the classical tradition. On the one hand, it may be held that we have a direct intuitive knowledge of God or of perfect being; in other words, that "ontologism" which says that we have in our minds the idea of a being than which a greater cannot be conceived, and this idea includes its "existence." Or, on the other hand, it may be said that we actually experience only finite degrees of good, and that from this experience we can argue to the neces- sary existence of the most perfect being. In either case, how- ever, there is nonsymbolic knowledge of Deity. We shall con- sider these possibilities later; here our only concern is to point out the metaphysical presuppositions of the classical theory and their difference from those of modernism. To these modern theories of religious symbolism we shall now turn. IV. MODERN THEORIES OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM Protestant theology, as distinguished from Catholic, was, as we have seen, characterized by its literalness. For reasons which we have also seen, symbolism as a theological principle fell into the background if it did not disappear entirely. As, however, Protestantism ran its course, the difficulties of its literalism became increasingly apparent. More and more religion was 41 am aware, of course, that many Roman Catholic theologians distinguish be- tween the theory of analogy and the theory of symbolism. The former is sound doc- trine, the latter is error. But on this point even the scholastic philosophers are not agreed. In so far as St. Thomas himself is concerned, it seems to me that for him symbolism is a theological principle. Since the "mode of signification" cannot be ap- plied literally to God, it would seem to follow that if it can be applied at all-and St. Thomas holds that it can-it must be applied symbolically. For that which is not literal representation must be symbolic in some sense. On these points see Edwyn Bevan, Symbolism and Belief (London: G. Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., I938), pp. 3II ff. 12</page><page sequence="13">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE contrasted with science, and since science, especially that of the classical Newtonian physics, was falsely assumed to be literal knowledge, religion came to be thought of more and more as a form of symbolism. But, and this is the important point, it was symbolism with a difference. The anagogical reference of the religious symbols was increasingly denied and their reference made merely human and social. Modernist philosophies of religion all have some theory of religious symbolism, but these theories all differ in toto from the classical. In general they are all moralistic and humanistic in character. All agree in denying the anagogic character of the religious symbol. As such, they are all naturalistic in their pre- suppositions. While the moral theory, represented by Kant, still recognizes a transcendent reference of the religious symbol, humanistic theories, since Feuerbach, despite their various forms, all tend to confine the reference of the religious symbol to the natural, whether human or nonhuman. A. THE MORAL THEORY OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM The moral theory as developed in modern times has, in gen- eral, been connected with Kant, for whom it is ordinarily held, although unjustly I believe, that the religious symbol has only moral meaning and import. However that may be, the moral theory in the Kantian form has given rise to a modern theory of religious symbolism which has become clearly defined and has established itself firmly within the borders of Catholic mod- ernism and liberal Protestantism. Sabatier, and symbolofideism in general, and the humanism of Feuerbach are conspicuous illus- trations of this view. The essential of the moral theory is the manner in which it interprets the numinous character of religious language and the unique character of the religious symbol. This is brought out clearly in Feuerbach's interpretation of this element in religion. The essential of man, as religious, is that he is aware of his finite limits. He who recognizes a limit is already in reflection I3</page><page sequence="14">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION beyond it, and for the classical theory this sense of the "beyond" or the infinite is the source of religion, for it implies that man is a part or is related to infinite being. For Feuerbach, and for the moral theory in general, the sense of the infinite implies no such thing. It implies merely that man is a part of humanity and the stirrings of the so-called infinite in him are merely the stirrings of humanity. It is important to realize that Kant himself, although credited with being the father of this theory, did not himself really hold it. Although his language is unfortunately ambiguous, he really held an anagogic or metaphysical theory of the religious symbol, as the entire tenor of the Critique of the Practical Reason makes clear, no less than a careful reading of the Critique of Judgment. He specifically held that phenomenal categories could be ap- plied to the noumenal symbolically. There is an important passage in the Critique of Judgment (secs. 89 and 90) in which he is asserting the possibility of a theology and seeks to harmonize that with what the critique of the speculative reason said of the categories. Kant points out that if I apply a phenomenal category to a supersensible being, namely, God, I can no longer apply it literally. Thus, if I speak of him as a "first mover," I must abstract from all spatial and temporal elements involved in the notion of motion, and the notion can therefore no longer give us knowledge in the sense of empirical science. Nevertheless, he insists that the cate- gories are applicable to God symbolically. We cannot, of course, operate with them, for operation involves space and time; but we can understand with them. He holds that "a cognition of God and of his being (theology) is possible by means of the properties and determinations of his causality merely thought of in him according to analogy which has all requisite reality in a practical reference, although only in respect to this." This is but one passage of many in which Kant makes it clear that he believes that there is "cognition of God," and that this cognition is possible through symbols taken from the sensi- I4</page><page sequence="15">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE ble or phenomenal world. This Kantian position has been well expressed in a more modern form by E. Brunner in his excellent study of religious knowledge (Das Symbolische in der religidsen Erkenntniss). In his discussion of the religious symbol he dis- tinguishes between primary and secondary religious symbolism: the secondary symbols correspond to the divine attributes and activities, the primary symbols to God or deity, the subject of the attributes or activities. Expansion of the secondary attri- butes shows their reference to be, as the moral theory main- tains, to the highest and deepest in human experience. But the unique character of the primary symbol, God, is found pre- cisely in the fact that it stands for, or refers to, not these values as such, but the metempirical or transcendent implicate of these values; in Brunner's terms, "the overworld latent or implied in the moral values." Thus, while both the names for God and for his attributes and activities have a symbolic element, there is an element in all symbolic knowledge which is nonsymbolic, namely, the direct knowledge or intuition of this reference to an overworld. The significant point in this theory is the interpretation of the primary symbolism, namely, the idea of God itself. On this view, the idea of God, to use the terms of Brightman, "symbol- izes the unity and harmony of value and existence or being." Such a view is, of course, not the classical theory in its ordinary expression, but it is an anagogic theory. It at least recognizes the fundamental thesis of the classical theory, namely, that an adequate theory of religious symbolism must be anagogic or metaphysical. B. HUMANISTIC AND PRAGMATIC THEORIES It is all important, I think, to recognize that the moral theory of Kant did not deny the anagogic or metaphysical im- port of the religious symbol; that here, as elsewhere, his break with traditional philosophy and theology is much less serious than is ordinarily understood. But if Kant did not deny the I5</page><page sequence="16">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION anagogic theory, the moral theories of humanism and prag- matism, developed under his influence, do. The essential of all such theories was expressed by Feuerbach in the thesis that the sense of the infinite implies no reference to noumenal or infinite being. It implies merely that man is part of humanity, and the religious stirrings in him are merely the stirrings of humanity. In other words, religious symbols are symbolic merely of human values and the names, both for God and for his attributes, have reference merely to the highest and deepest in us. It is not my purpose here to enter upon a critique of humanis- tic theories of religion as such, but solely as they affect the problem of symbolism. As such they have all the difficulties of a purely moral theory with additional defects of their own. The essential character of all such theories is that they interpret the symbol in terms of what is not meant by the symbol. The ap- parent meaning of the religious symbol is its reference to over- individual values; its real meaning, according to humanism, is to be found in causes, environmental and social, which have produced the images and symbols. On this theory the religious symbol becomes doubly fictitious and illusory. It is illusory in the first place, because, although apparently referring to the superhuman, it really refers only to human values. It is illu- sory, in the second place, because, while apparently referring to values, in reality it refers merely to physical and social causes. Humanistic theories inevitably become theories of "fruitful illusion." The symbols of the religious imagination are really fictions, although useful fictions. They become merely behavioral symbols; the question then is one not of symbolic truth but of symbolic effectiveness. The virtual atheism of humanism is then much more intelligi- ble when it becomes explicit atheism. It would be much more intelligible to see in the language of religion a purely emotive language and one which is, strictly speaking, meaningless. Thus, when a representative humanist (Dr. Holmes) tells us that i6</page><page sequence="17">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE "until the supernatural is eliminated from the minds of men we shall not be able to comprehend the nature of religion," we can only reply that to comprehend it thus is to dissolve it into something else-to denature it as religion. V. SYMBOLIC AND LITERAL KNOWLEDGE IN RELIGION THE PROBLEM OF RELIGIOUS REALISM Modernist theories of religious symbolism, as contrasted with all forms of the classical, are then characterized by the denial of all transcendent reference to the symbol, its reference being only to the moral and the human. This essential character, in contrast to the realism of the classical theory, may be described as religious nominalism. Religious nominalism has found repeated statement through- out this modern naturalistic era. I choose as my illustration a presentation taken from Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity. If the predicates of God are an anthropomorphism, if love, goodness, personality are human attributes, so also is the subject which you suppose here-the existence of God, the belief that there is a god-an anthro- pomorphism, a presupposition purely human. Yet, he alone is a true atheist to whom the predicates of the divine being, e.g., love, justice, wisdom are nothing, not he to whom the subject of these predicates is nothing. And in no wise is the negation of the subject necessarily also the negation of the predicates considered in themselves. These have an intrinsic independent reality; they force their recognition upon man by their very nature. The idea of God is dependent upon the idea of justice, of goodness, of wisdom .... but the converse does not hold. Religion, however, knows nothing of anthropomorphism; to it they are not anthro- pomorphisms-they are pronounced to be images only by the under- standing that reflects upon religion. Here we have the essentials of all humanism-its religious nominalism and virtual atheism. It is that the existence of God is itself an anthropomorphism-a supposition purely human. It is an attempt to retain the religious symbols and their values without the object which alone gives them significance as val- I 7</page><page sequence="18">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ues. Religious nominalism is "empty" symbolism. Being thus empty, it leads to the stultification of all religion. A. RELIGIOUS REALISM: NONSYMBOLIC RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE Religious realism, defined in the broadest sense, is an episte- mological theory which asserts that religion gives us knowledge, both of the divine attributes and of the subject of the divine attributes. It insists that assertions about the nature of God are real assertions and that these descriptions are not descrip- tions that "describe nothing." In this general sense all genuine religion is realistic and all adequate theories of religious knowledge must be realistic. The numinous character of religious language and the unique char- acter of the religious symbol require that religious experience, in order to retain its character as religious, must have a unique object, and that propositions embodying that experience have a transcendent reference. The difficulty is to state the theory adequately. One form of this theory, which, I confess, I have never been able really to understand, seems to hold that we have some sort of experience, in the sense of the ordinary empiricist, of the divine being or entity, God, the subject of the theological predi- cates. In the attempt to make religion purely empirical, aware- ness of God is likened to the perception of a physical object- "perception in a complex"-the only difference being that our data are not sensuous. Much more understandable is the fur- ther step taken by Professor Wieman when he maintains that the data of religion are as sensuous as those of science. But surely such a theory, in either form, plays directly into the hands of the positivist and humanist. With a religious realism thus stated, criticism can, I am afraid, make short work. Re- ligious words, the names of the gods, so the positivist may say, had, it is true, originally empirical reference and therefore mean- ing; for they did then refer to observable entities, such as light, thunder, fire, etc. But they have ceased to have meaning, for</page><page sequence="19">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE they no longer refer to anything observable. On such a religious realism we have either positivism or incommunicable mysti- cism. Somewhat more tenable is that form of religious realism which speaks not of an entity which is the object of a unique religious experience, not of the Deity, but of a quality of deity which pervades as a presence the phenomena of experience. This no- tion of an emergent quality of deity, maintained by S. Alexander and others, in some way experienced as other qualities, is an attractive and fascinating one. It affords a sort of empirical way of expressing the numinous character of religious experience and language. But such a notion also has it difficulties. In the strict meaning of sense experience we know of no kind by which such a quality could be intuited. Moreover, the notion of God as a quality, still more as an emergent, is one which it is diffi- cult to make intelligible to the religious consciousness. Never- theless, it is possible to make use of this notion if we are careful to avoid the implications which a too literal conception of qual- ity seems to involve. There is a sense in which we may speak of a numinous quality of experience which we may call the "quality of deity." It is, I think, not a unique datum of experi- ence so much as a unique dimension which many data of ex- perience may have. In the terminology of value theory, the "holy" is not a separate value but a dimension of the other values, sensuous, aesthetic, moral. Though not exclusively con- nected with the moral, it is, however, only in connection with the moral that the full religious quality is felt. It is only when "the infinitely other" fuses with the "infinitely good" that the full quality of deity is experienced. The referent of primary re- ligious symbolism is not, as we saw, the moral values as such, but the metempirical coimplicate of these values. It is this that gives them their religious dimension. This dimension, I should maintain, is as much a part of the experience of values, is as much intuited as these values. I9</page><page sequence="20">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION B. THE RELIGIOUS A PRIORI To my mind, then, as is now evident, there is no tenable re- ligious realism which does not involve a doctrine of the religious a priori. I am a religious realist, as opposed to the religious nominalist; that is, I believe that no tenable view of religious symbolic knowledge can be developed which does not presup- pose direct knowledge of the nonsymbolic. But I believe that this knowledge must be a priori. In this respect, I am in sym- pathy with Professor Bixler's careful answer to the question, "Can Religion Become Empirical?" Surely "the resort to em- piricism in religion" has, as he says, "raised at least as many problems as it has solved."5 A religious realism, in the sense of the a priori, brings us back, however, to the traditional view in one of its important forms. The idea of a most perfect being is given as a necessary coimpli- cate of our experience of human values, and it is only on the basis of this fact that we can with any justification extend our human categories symbolically to the divine. This is, to my mind, the great and inexpugnable element in the historical ontologism of Christian theology and in the ontological argu- ment. The ens perfectissimum is God. Perfection is not a predi- cate of deity, but the essence of deity itself. It is quite generally held that Kant once and for all disposed of ontologism and the ontological argument. This I believe to be a mistake, although I shall not argue the point here. As a matter of fact, I do not believe that he himself really thought that he had disposed of it. The really significant contribution of Kant lay elsewhere, namely, in showing, once and for all, that there are no purely empirical proofs for the existence of God, that the so-called empirical proofs really presuppose the ontological. Gilson has admitted (in The Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy) that the ontological proof is the "initial datum" of the empirical or inductive proofs. But what really is the s J. S. Bixler, "Can Religion Become Empirical?" in the volume of essays entitled The Nature of Religious Experience. 20</page><page sequence="21">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE difference between saying, with Kant, that the empirical or inductive proof presupposes the ontological or that the latter is the initial datum on which the other proofs rest? The point at issue is whether, were there no such initial datum, however we get it, there could be any empirical argument or proof. What Kant did not see is that the moral argument also pre- supposes this initial datum. This is clearly seen in the nature of the argument from degrees of good in St. Thomas, out of which Kant's moral argument developed. There has indeed been much dispute among Thomistic scholars whether this moral argument is not a form of the ontological. I should not wish to say that it is a form of the ontological argument but, using Gilson's terms again, it presupposes it as its initial datum. In sum-and this is the point I wish to emphasize here-an adequate theory of religious symbolism does presuppose reli- gious realism or a nonsymbolic knowledge of deity, but such knowledge must contain an a priori element. No empirical ar- gument for God's existence can be formulated which does not presuppose an a priori knowledge of deity as an initial datum. If the perfect or infinite were not a necessary coimplicate of our imperfect and finite consciousness, we should never even raise the problem of the existence of God at all. VI. SYMBOLISM IN THEOLOGY AND SYMBOLISM IN SCIENCE Symbolism as a theological principle cannot be enunciated without raising the question of symbolic truth in religion. Nor can this question be raised without involving problems of sym- bolism in other fields of experience, pre-eminently that of sci- ence. It is to these problems that we must now turn. The present pope is reported to have said that "Those who speak of the incompatibility of science and religion either make science say that which it never said or make religion say that which it never taught." For myself, I believe this to be in principle true. Kant, it will be recalled, said it is wonderful 21</page><page sequence="22">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION what little minds can do with great issues, and I believe it is the fatality of little minds to make both science and religion say what they really do not mean. We are familiar enough with this fatality in religion. Bibli- cal literalism, as well as the credal literalism of theology, of which I shall speak presently, has made religion say what it never really taught. The literalism of modern science, until very recent times, has continually made science say what we now know it never really said. Literalism is as much a nuisance in science as in religion and the literalism of Newtonian physics, which made of the world a congeries of little bits of matter, was as inimical to both thought and culture as the literalism which made of it the manufactured article of a "big man." Both were guilty of the "fallacy of misplaced literalism" and out of this fallacy arose the chief difficulties of science and religion. A. SYMBOLISM AS A SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE The problem of the relation of science and religion is then, from one aspect, the problem of the relation of two types of symbolism or of two symbolic forms. Both science and religion recognize their symbolic character. I shall start, therefore, with symbolism as a scientific principle. The development of this part of my general thesis requires much more of an elaboration than time will allow. Fortunately in this presence I can presuppose a good deal. Over and over again, we are told, by the physical scientists themselves, that between what is called Newtonian science and that of the pres- ent there is in this respect a great gap. Sir William Thomson's idea of the "understanding" of a phenomenon of nature is con- stantly contrasted with the notion of the scientific concept since Hertz. For the former to understand was to construct a mechanical model which should "represent literally the happen- ing in all its parts." For the latter to understand involves no such literal copy, but a relation that is purely symbolic. This contrast of the symbol with the literal or copy theory is a com- monplace of present-day scientific epistemology. 22</page><page sequence="23">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE The significance of this, in the first place, is that symbolism has been accepted as a scientific principle-as part of the new scientific epistemology. For proof of this statement I could, of course, cite all the leading physicists-Jeans, Max Planck, Weyl-for all of whom our concepts of the physical world are "to an incalculable degree ideal constructions," and the knowl- edge which they give symbolic. A summary statement by Weyl of the principle must suffice for our present purpose. "Science," he writes, "concedes to idealism that its objective world is not given, but propounded (like a problem to be solved) and that it can be constructed only by symbols."6 For myself I draw the same idealistic consequences as does Weyl, but these are not necessary for the present argument. All that is necessary is the acceptance of symbolism as a scientific principle. The acceptance of this principle is significant itself, as an im- portant party of the philosophy of science. It is in fact changing in significant ways our evaluation of science. But even more important, from our standpoint at least, are the possibilities it opens up for the understanding of the relations of science and its symbolisms to other aspects of human experience, more par- ticularly the religious. The assumption underlying the entire humanistic treatment of religion, more especially that of the positivists, is the literal significance of scientific concepts. This has resulted in extreme cases in the extrusion of theology from the sphere of knowledge and its relegation to that of poetry. I believe that the recognition of the essentially symbolic char- acter of our fundamental physical concepts must lead not only to a revaluation of scientific knowledge but also to an equally fundamental revaluation of religious concepts and symbols. The point I have been making has been expressed by Edding- ton in a number of contexts, but pre-eminently in Science and the Unseen World. In using him to point my moral I do not wish to commit myself either to his brand of idealism or to all his positions on moot scientific questions, but rather to emphasize a general epistemological thesis, shared, I believe, by a great 6 Mind and Nature (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1934), pp. 38 f. 23</page><page sequence="24">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION many scientists. "The exploration of the external world by sci- ence leads," he tells us, "not to concrete reality, but to a shad- ow world of symbols beneath which these methods are not adapted to penetrating. Force, energy, dimensions belong to the world of symbols; it is out of such conceptions that we have built the external world of physics. What other conception," he asks, "have we? After exhausting physical methods we must again return to the inmost recesses of consciousness. It is the very essence of this world that the conception of personality should dominate." The reaction against anthropomorphism is understandable, he recognizes. But it is nevertheless in prin- ciple unsound. In the world of moral and religious experi- ence a wholly different kind of symbol is requisite. The explora- tion of this aspect of experience leads to a wholly different world outlook than the scientific, and for the expression of this out- look a wholly different symbolic form is necessary. B. THE FALLACY OF MISPLACED LITERALISM Both science and religion are justified in insisting upon a literal element in their knowledge, or as I should prefer, the nonsymbolic. The notion of symbol and symbolic knowledge is meaningless unless some form of nonsymbolic knowledge is pre- supposed. A theory of universal symbolism or metaphor is equivalent to a pan-fictionism. The question is precisely where this literal or nonsymbolic knowledge is to be found. To find it in the wrong place is to be guilty of what I shall call the "fallacy of misplaced literalism." Both religion and science are often guilty of this fallacy. This fallacy as it appears in science is evident on the slightest inspection and is recognized by all of the more enlightened modern physicists. It consists in attributing to our symbolic constructions the status of sensuously observable entities. We need not go to the length of Eddington of calling electrons merely dummies in our mathematical equations, nor of Jeans of calling them clothes with which we drape our mathematical 24</page><page sequence="25">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE equations; but we can agree with Margenau that their ontologi- cal status is a wholly metaphysical question. In any case, this fallacy of misplaced literalism consists precisely in taking our sensible and pseudosensible constructs-in other words, our scientific anthropomorphisms-as though they were literal copies. Out of this procedure has come the major part of the antireligious dogmatisms of science. No less serious is this fallacy when it appears as religion. In the terms of St. Thomas, it is taking "modes of signification" as they appear in creatures as though they belonged properly and strictly to God in whom these perfections are infinite. There is literal knowledge of God, but it is not found in those anthropomorphisms in terms of which his nature is inevitably expressed for our type of consciousness. God is, as we have seen, our word for the unity and harmony of value and being. Of him, therefore, the perfections in their infinite nature are literally true. But to call the values as experienced by creatures literally true of deity involves the fallacy of misplaced literal- ness. Considerations of this nature have a special bearing on the problems which have arisen in connection with the nature and interpretation of creeds, more particularly the Nicene. These contain, as is generally recognized, three types of propositions; those which have to do with the timeless being and nature of God (before all worlds); those which have to do with his rela- tions to the cosmos (creation, etc.); and those which are the statements of historical fact. The symbolic element in the first two is recognized, not only actually but in principle, by the classical theory of the symbol. They are not literal in their mode of signification. The literalness of the statements of his- toric fact raises the chief issue. This issue is discussed with admirable clearness and candor by A. E. Taylor in his chapter on "Religion and the Historical."7 7 The Faith of a Moralist, II (Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of St. Andrews, 1926-28; London: Macmillan, I930), chap. iv, pp. I4I f. 25</page><page sequence="26">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION He points out that "attempts to divest religion of attachments to historical persons and events is an attempt to manufacture the supreme reality out of mere universals, or to make an 'is' out of a mere 'ought,' and ends in degrading religion into a mere theosophy." The historical element in religion is then an essential part of its nature. But he also rightly sees that no hard-and-fast line can be drawn between the symbolical and the historical, as is often done in the interpretation of the creeds. Such a distinction can only be regarded as one of degree. The fundamental difficulty, he recognizes, lies in the nature of lan- guage itself. "No language is even approximately free from the symbolic except the artificial language of mathematical logic and that logic is impotent to describe the simplest and most familiar event." Here we have the crux of the matter. All lan- guage, and afortiori dramatic language, in which alone religion can speak, is in principle symbolic. This fact does not, however, exclude the equally important fact that real events take place in time which have the numinous quality of deity, and these constitute the historical element in religion. In rendering these real events and their quality in language, only that language can be used which was made to describe the phenomenal or created with the inevitable consequence that the language must be symbolic. It is for this reason, as we have seen, that the language of religion must have the vis poetica. It is for this reason also that in Christian theology the creed, as a whole, is called a "symbol" and is recognized as a symbolic form in which the nonsymbolic is expressed. It is then-to return to the Pope's statement-of the utmost importance to determine what both religion and science really say. There can be no manner of doubt that they are both con- stantly made to say what they really do not mean, and when this is done there is of course no possibility of mutual under- standing. Now it is not within either my competence or the province of this address to attempt to tell you what either sci- ence or religion really says. I am neither a scientist nor a theo- 26</page><page sequence="27">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE logian. It is, however, quite within my province, as a philoso- pher, to say that no adequate interpretation of either is possible until we recognize that symbolism is a fundamental principle in the methodology of both. And, moreover, that there is no possibility of relating the two until we recognize that both are symbolic forms or ways of representing symbolically the same ultimate reality. There is a much-quoted statement of Clutton-Brock to the effect that "religion is forced to tell many little lies in the inter- est of a great truth, while science inclines to tell many little truths in the interest of a great lie." I agree with Reinhold Niebuhr in his interpretation of this statement, that the great truth in the interest of which the so-called little lies are told, is that life and history have a meaning, and that the source and fulfilment of that meaning lie beyond history. But I should deny that they are little lies unless they are taken as literally true. On the other hand, it is a great lie in the interest of which science tells its little truths, namely, that spatiotemporal reali- ties are self-contained and self-explanatory. But the little truths science tells are as much lies as the big lie, if our statements about spatiotemporal realities are taken as literally true of ulti- mate reality. In science and religion alike we cannot distinguish truth from falsity until we know what both really say. VII. THE DTLEMMA OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM OF THE LITERAL I have now developed the main theses of my general topic, "Symbolism as a Theological Principle." I have shown, I think, not only why religious knowledge is necessarily symbolic but why, in view of that fact, symbolism must consciously be made a theological principle. I have shown, in the second place, that science, also, to use an expression of Cassirer, is symbolic form. Symbolism is also a scientific principle and the relation of sci- ence to religion is a problem of the relation of two symbolic forms. 27</page><page sequence="28">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Now it cannot be denied that theses such as the foregoing are bound to meet with a very definite resistance. Some of you have doubtless felt that resistance. If you are primarily men of science you may have resisted the notion of science as symbol- ism; if you are primarily men of religion it is against symbolism as a theological principle that you may inwardly strive. It is, in fact, only unwillingly that either of these two great symbolic forms realize their own intrinsic nature. Of the two, however, it is in the main religion that is most unwilling. As a theological friend of mine says of himself, every move towards symbolism is followed by fits of literalism. Now in a sense this is as it should be. The literalist is indeed a nuisance in both science and religion, but he is the unmitigated nuisance he is precisely because he has a great deal to say for himself. Because men are guilty of the fallacy of misplaced literalism, it does not follow that there is no literal knowledge at all. The plain man feels, and rightly, that there must be literal or nonsymbolic knowledge somewhere. That there is a nonsymbolic element in both science and re- ligion I would be the last to deny-I have, in fact, insisted upon it throughout-the problem is as to the locus of this element. So far as science is concerned, we may perhaps place it where critical science is disposed to locate it, namely, in those proposi- tions which refer directly to sensuously observable entities. Per- sonally I should be disposed to place it where Kant did, namely, in connection with the categories of the understanding. Only propositions about phenomena can be called literal, all others being symbolic. But I should not insist upon this here. In the case of religion, on the other hand, it is the phenomenal cate- gories which when applied to the noumenal are symbolic, while the consciousness of the metempirical coimplicate of our human values is the nonsymbolic. In any case there is nonsymbolic re- ligious knowledge, although it cannot be expressed except in symbolic form. 28</page><page sequence="29">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE A. THE DILEMMA OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE That religious knowledge must be in part symbolic we may now see; but what we want, we are told, is the "blunt" truth, not truth seen through a glass darkly. But literal or blunt truth has, alas, through the fallacy of misplaced literalism, the un- happy fashion of becoming untruth. This is the dilemma of the religious consciousness. Stated in other words, "religion cannot do without the supernatural, yet it cannot do with it; for it refuses to be completely rationalized."8 It cannot do without the supernatural, for if it attempts to, it is no longer religion. When the humanist tells us that until the supernatural is elimi- nated from the minds of men we shall not be able to compre- hend the nature of religion, we can only answer that to com- prehend it in his sense is to dissolve it into something else- to denature it. On the other hand, if it retains the supernatural, religion must speak as symbol and parable, for only so can we speak about that which transcends nature and its categories. This situation has been called by Professor Bennett the dilemma of religion and it is a real dilemma which remains in all its stubbornness. There have been two typical ways of meeting this dilemma, both of which involve the dissolving of religion into something else. The first of these is the familiar one of dissolving it into poetry. This is, of course, an easy solution of the problem. On the assumption that if assertions do not have literal significance, they have no significance at all, it may be argued, as by the positivists, that the language of religion is wholly emotive and that it really says nothing at all. It is not surprising that this solution has attracted many minds who seek short cuts to the solution of difficult problems and are not particularly conscien- tious as to the facts they trample down in taking the short cut. The trouble is, of course, that it is far too simple. It assumes 8 Charles A. Bennett, The Dilemma of Religious Knowledge (New Haven: Yale Uni- versity Press, I93I). 29</page><page sequence="30">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION that because the vis poetica is necessarily present in all genuine religious language, religion is only poetry; and, second, be- cause it is poetic it cannot give us truth. I do not know which is a greater stultification of human experience, the inhuman positivism which says that religious assertions are pseudosen- tences and meaningless or the humanistic sentimentalist who seeks to retain religious meanings after their truth values are denied. The second way of meeting the dilemma is to dissolve religion wholly into philosophy or metaphysics, a solution advocated by certain forms of metaphysical idealism. "Religion must," in the words of Croce, "allow itself to be dissolved into philoso- phy." Religion is in principle mythology, in the broad sense of the term, and, as such, its fate is to be the vestibule of meta- physics. It is true that Croce recognizes in religion a puzzling something which is more than philosophy, namely, worship. Nevertheless its fortune, whether good or bad, is to be thus dis- solved. This solution obviously does greater justice to the facts of religion than the former. Hegel, for instance, never denied the anagogic character of the religious symbols or that they give us truth. But the difficulties here are also very great; this solu- tion is also far too simple. It assumes that the vis poetica can be eliminated from religion and religion still remain. To elimi- nate the historical element from religion-and the dramatic language in which alone the historical can be expressed-is to degrade religion into a mere theosophy. To dissolve religion into metaphysics is to denature it just as surely as to dissolve it into poetry. Now, in my view, neither of these ways of solving the dilemma is possible, nor is either necessary. And it is in a sense precisely for the solution of this dilemma that I have developed the proposition, "symbolism as a theological principle." Both types of solution proceed, I believe, on certain false assumptions: (i) that what we really want is the so-called blunt truth; and (2) that even if we really wanted it we could actually get it. Now 30</page><page sequence="31">SYMBOLISM AS A THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE I do not deny that many of us think that we want this kind of truth. I suppose all of us want it in our naive and unguarded moments. But really to want it is to be unaware of the nature of either language or truth. For what is called blunt truth is almost invariably a case of the fallacy of misplaced literalism. The plain, blunt man, at least as I have known him, is usually as deficient in imagination and insight as in philosophical under- standing. But even if the blunt truth is what we want, we could never get it, at least not in this world. To suppose that we can is to misunderstand entirely the nature of language and expres- sion which, as we have seen, is without symbolic elements only when it says nothing. When one really understands the nature of language, one sees, with A. E. Taylor, that to talk at all is to use symbol. B. THE LOCUS OF THE LITERAL IN RELIGION AND THEOLOGY But you will finally ask-and I am not insensible to your growing impatience-where then is the literal in theological knowledge? What is the locus of the literal when we avoid the fallacy of misplaced literalism? Surely you can be plain and blunt enough to state this finally in words of one syllable. My answer to this question is, I think, clear enough. It is, in principle, no different from what I have described as the classical answer. It is true, I should say, that the predicates we apply to God, to the infinite and the absolute, are, in their mode of signification, all symbolic. For we cannot apply them other than as they appear in creatures. But the perfections themselves, for which these predicates stand, or to which they refer, are true literally. Otherwise expressed, the language of religion, like all language, has a symbolic element in it, by vir- tue of its origin in creatures; but the numinous quality which permeates and informs that language refers to a perfect being which is the necessary coimplicate of all our experience and its expression. This is the locus of the literal. I am not disposed to deny that, in the context of modern 31</page><page sequence="32">32 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION thought and knowledge, this classical formulation of symbolism as a theological principle may, with advantage, be restated. Indeed, some suggestions as to its restatement are implied in what has preceded. But no restatement, I am convinced, can change in principle the line between the literal and the symbolic, as here drawn. To place it elsewhere means, I think, necessarily one of two alternatives: either humanism with its implied nat- uralism and atheism or negative theology with its agnosticism and inexpressible mysticism. These are the Scylla and the Charybdis between which reli- gion and theology find themselves sailing today. Both arise out of the fallacy of misplaced literalism and both can be es- caped only by reinstating in satisfactory form the notion of symbolism as a theological principle.
