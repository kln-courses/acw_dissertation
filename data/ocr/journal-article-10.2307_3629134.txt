<plain_text><page sequence="1">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY LAWRENCE KRADER T HE BURYATS are the northernmost Mongol-speaking people, occupying the steppes and river-sides to the east, south, and west of Lake Baikal. They have been subject to acculturative processes since early in the 17th century when Russian explorers and colonialists first came into contact with them, the contact having extended uninterruptedly since then down to the present day. The Buryats are by tradition a pastoral nomadic people with a considerable investment in hunting. They are the northernmost of the complex pastoralists as well; their herds consist of cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and even a scattering of camels; in the same latitudes, but to the west and east are simple herdsmen, whose sole domesticated animal is the reindeer, on the slopes of the Sayan and Altai moun- tain chains and in the Amur region. The bulk of reindeer breeding, however, is to the north of the Buryat forest-steppe, while the locus classicus of complex herd- ing in eastern and northern Asia lies in the steppe to the south, in Mongolia. Buryat mythology assigns a central place to bull-ancestors, horses whose wisdom is superhuman, and sheep endowed with magical properties. During the course of the 19th century, however, they developed sedentary agriculture through Russian contact, while dependence on the hunt for livelihood shrank almost to nothing, at the same time that pastoralism appreciably diminished. The Buryats are approaching the number of 300,000 for the second time in their history; the central tendency in their population density is 2-5 per km sq, which is a typical figure for complex pastoralists. Buryat social organization is centered around the joint principle of patrilineal descent and agnatic relationship, which they have applied with a consistency matched by few other societies in the world. All Buryats trace descent from a single common ancestor, a mythical figure who may differ from group to group within Buryat society. Thus, a Buryat of Cis-Baikalia (to the west of Baikal) will impute descent from his primary ancestor to all Buryats, while a Trans-Baikal Buryat (to the east and south of Baikal), who traces descent from a different founding ancestor, will do the same. All Buryats are theoretically related by ties of agnatic consanguinity. Moreover, there is a relationship between neighborhood and kinship; the closer the kinship relation between two Buryats, the closer their proximity to each other in residence. A man's closest kin are residents of the 322 VOL. 10, 1954</page><page sequence="2">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 323 same nomadic kin-village, ulas.' The lineage, urag, comprising a group of related kin-villages, forms the next largest social grouping, and a number of lineages form a clan, xolbbn or obag. There are instances of still larger Buryat groupings, among them clan federations, but in these structures the ties of consanguinity are necessarily distant and loose, hence they are organs of political power rather than kinship relationship; but since the manipulation of political power in a state structure is but poorly conceptualized by the Buryats, these confederations and principalities are ephemeral phenomena. The eastern and southern Buryats have had more stable political organizations than the western, which may be attributed to the greater proximity and closer relationships of the former, the Trans-Baikal Buryats, to the Khalkha Mongols, i.e., the Mongols of Outer Mongolia, who are their neighbors to the south. To this must be added the greater Russian impact on the western than on the eastern Buryats. The closer relationships of the Selenga River and Khori Buryats (the Trans-Baikal Buryats in question) with the Khalkha Mongols may be shown in the religious sphere as well, for these Buryats assign a greater role to Lamaism than do the western and northern Buryats. However, all the Buryats are funda- mentally shamanist, despite an overlay of Lamaism; Lamaism has had a lesser but yet perceptible influence on the Cis-Baikal Buryats as well.2 We may regard the Buryat clan, lineage, kin-village, and other formations already described as diachronic or vertical organizations of the society, vertical or ascending and descending in time, because they depend for definition on rela- tionship to a given paternal ancestor. Relationship by agnation and hence group membership is therefore determined by establishing a common ancestor and tracing the genealogical line to and from him. In addition to the vertical organiza- tion of society, in which time as reckoned in the generation count is the paramount criterion, there is the composition of society by its contemporary members. In the Buryat tradition, all members of the society are distributed in three social classes or strata-the aristocratic, the commoner, and the slave-which may be viewed as the synchronic or horizontal organization of the society. Through further analysis of the dynamics of Buryat patrilineality, both those modes of social organization, the diachronic and the synchronic, may be derived from a single set of principles. In order to establish these principles we must first 1 Where possible, the transcription of Buryat names and terms has followed Cheremisov's Dictionary (1951).

The aristocrats and the commoners between them form the synchronically interrelating members in a group of common descent. (In archaic times, the slaves as a third stratum were subordinated to the first two.) Time as an analytic device is not necessary to establish the required relationship of superiority-subordination, prestige-respect, authority-obedience which exists between the aristocrats and subjects. The rela- tionship is established through personal recognition, through the identification of external marks or signs, sumptuary clothing or the lack of it, and so forth. Nevertheless, both aristocrat and commoner are the descendants of one and the same ancestor, and it is upon the anvil of the common descent group that the pattern of diachronic organization of the society is hammered out. In the dia- chronic organization, time is an analytic device in the establishment of relationship in consanguinity. The genealogical principle in reckoning kinship is the opposite of the technique of social differentiation, for in establishing kinship it establishes community and group membership. Consanguineal differentiation is established by preferment of the eldest son and the eldest son's line in primogenitary succession. Thus, within the Buryat world, descent lines are ranked according to the seniority of the founder, i.e., the rank-order of birth in relation to founders of other descent lines in the same generation. The senior descent line or lines are the aristocracy, the junior descent lines are the commoners. As to the two different modes of social organization-by social strata and by lines of descent-even though they may be related through a common set of principles, nevertheless they must be kept separate because with each one a different type of religious phenomenon is associated. Both modes are concep- tualized and explicity set forth in Buryat intellectual life, mythology, and religion. In addition to these two modes, there is a limited amount of craft specializa- tion, notably the shamans and the smiths, both of whom have a religious function. Finally there are traces of a dual organization of society-very weak traces-and these will be alluded to only in passing. On the contrary, the dual organization of the spirit world is of paramount importance. Far older than Lamaism, far more widely distributed among the Buryats, is the somewhat amorphous body of doctrines, beliefs, rites, myths which consti- tutes the form of shamanism particular to themselves. Buryat religion has been described in several of its aspects in the western anthropological literature: there is an excellent summary article by Demetrius Klements3 on shamanism and the 3 Klementz, 1924.</page><page sequence="4">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 325 spiritual hierachy and ritual; by Garma Sand'eyev4 on the world-view of the Buryat shamanists; and latterly by Pater Schmidt,5 which presented the Buryat religion in the aspect of its cult of the supreme being. There is one problem in the study of Buryat religion which has not been treated hitherto, but which constitutes a classical question in ethnology-the rela- tionship between the social organization and the organization of the religious conceptions of a given people. Durkheim has carried farther than any other ethnologist the study of the relationship between the specific structuring of the world of the sacred and of the profane. His conclusions took on a dialectic form, through the interpenetration of religious phenomena in society and of social phenomena in the religious world. "If religion has engendered all that is essential in society, the idea of society is the soul of religion."" As a further expression of this dialectic he postulated that the individual does not innately conceive of the collective ideal of religion, but rather that it is in the school of the collective life of society that the individual learns to realize the religious ideal.7 The materials toward these formulations were the close parallels between the social structure and the cosmology of given peoples, among them the Zufii and the Arunta. More recently, a similar correlation was made by Evans-Pritchard when he submitted his monograph on Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande to re-think- ing in the course of a lecture given in 1950. The monograph had first been pre- pared in the 1930s and its author then started from the premise of the lack of inner coordination of Zande magic, the lack of system or nexus in the magical rites.s In later examination of his own researches, Evans-Pritchard developed a more architectonic view of Zande magic religion, and concluded that the entire political hierarchy of Zande society as well as its fabric of kinship is closely reflected in the pattern of magical rites." In the following pages, no integral picture of Buryat religion will be offered; neither the religious doctrines nor the social organization of the Buryats form a single, coherent, internally consistent whole. Nevertheless, a few formative prin- ciples upon which both society and religion rest may be established, and a number of correlations between the two as well. The very number of these correlations is a matter of considerable moment. Moreover, the correlated phenomena lie at the core of their respective spheres. From these considerations it follows that the 4 Sandceyev, 1927-1928. 5 Schmidt, 1951. 6 Durkheim, p. 599. 7 Idem, p. 604. 8 Evans-Pritchard, 1937, p. 540. 9 Evans-Pritchard, 1951, pp. 101-102.</page><page sequence="5">326 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY essences of the Buryat worlds of the sacred and profane are twin and coardinate with each other. In part these coordinations of the two worlds must be derived from that which is implicit in the ethnographic material, but to the greater extent they have been formulated expressis verbis by the Buryats themselves, and are therefore primary data. The major corpus of these materials covers the period from the 1870s to the mid-1920s, and is the contribution of a number of Russian-educated Buryats, Agapitov, Khangalov, Diamtsarano, Mikhail Bogdanov, and Garma Sandzeyev, working either alone or in collaboration with Russian scholars of the period, the chief of whom were Krol', Klements, and N. Poppe. The work of another fine Buryat thinker, Dordoi Banzarov, belongs to an earlier era and another body of literature. The sum of the contributions of these Buryats constitutes a veritable awakening of Buryat intellectual culture of the era. Their written record is exten- sive, varied, and rich in information, in the form of autobiographic recollections, scientific investigations, and scholarly text-redactions. Their themes are the cos- mology, religion, world-view, social life, and folklore of their people. As a group they have accomplished a victory of the human spirit through the simultaneous pursuit of a double path: they were at once the spokesmen for and the recorders of their culture. Within the institutional and linguistic framework of another culture they were able to set down what they observed and learned as Buryats, viewing the same data likewise from the standpoint of the objective disciplines which they later mastered. They lived in two worlds, their native and that of the western academic culture, moving outward from their own culture in the opposite sense to that of the ethnographer. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COSMOS BY THREES The primary element in the coirdination of the two worlds is the triple divi- sion of the social world, the triple division of the spirit world and the three souls of men.10 The spirits are the most important features of Buryat religion; they include the deities at the highest level; they are prayed to, sacrificed to, invoked for blessing, and for the exorcism of evil and of sickness, both human and zodtic. The spirits are divided into the higher spirits, the middle, and the lower. The higher spirits, called tengeri (plural tengeriner) live in heaven, direct and control everything, take care of mankind. These tengeriner are in their turn divided into three; the two lower ranks within the superior category functioning as intercessors between man and the highest beings. The spirits of the middle rank, b6xoldoy, are considered the spirits of the commoner Buryats (the term is rendered b6xoldey 10 Klements and Khangalov, pp. 132-133.</page><page sequence="6">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 327 by Castrinll with the meaning "spirit in the service of the shamans.") Finally, in the presentation of Klements and Khangalov, there are the spirits of the lowest rank, the spirits of the slaves. Both the middle and lower order of spirits were fully subordinate to the higher order. The religious doctrine of the triple division in the Buryat cosmology is paral- leled by the triple division in the Buryat doctrine of man. Man is conceived as being composed of three parts: the body, beye, i.e., the physical organism of man; amin, the breath and life-principle resident in the living organism; and hiinehen, the soul of man.12 The soul in turn is submitted in Buryat pneumatology to a triple division, again hierarchized in an upper, a middle, and a lower order. There are two basic descriptions of the Buryat doctrine of the soul, that found in Klements and Khangalov and that of Sandzeyev: both are in agreement on the fundamental traits.13 Sandzeyev prefaces his remarks on the soul with the note that in one group, the Alar-Buryats, there are numerous souls, but that these are grouped in three chief categories. The first of these is the soul which is housed in man, more precisely, in the skeleton of man, and in the skeleton as a whole, not in any one part. This soul is an invisible copy of the skeleton, and if the skeleton is injured, e.g., if a bone is broken, this soul is harmed. Animals also are in possession of such a soul, and at a sacrifice, a deep concern is to protect the bones of the sacrificial animal. For if the bones of the offering are broken, the soul would be injured and the sacrifice would be rejected by the deity to whom it was offered.14 This soul corresponds to the lowest soul in the presentation of Klements and Khangalov; one of its attributes is its existence among animals as well as among men. The second soul of man has the capacity to leave the body and dwell in the world; it can transform itself into a flying thing, such as a wasp or a bee, and can undertake activities of which its possessor is unconscious. In its non-trans- formed state it is anthropomorphic, however, and its seat is in the organs of the trunk of man: the heart, the liver, the lungs, also the larynx, possibly the blood as well. This soul is readily alarmed and is disposed to flee from danger, e.g., the barking of a dog, and must then be tempted back, especially in the case of the second soul of a child.5" It is this soul which is invoked, projected and manipu- 11 Castrin, 1857, p. 169. 12 Podgorbunskiy, p. 18. 13 Klements and Khangalov, loc. cit.; Sandieyev, 1927, pp. 578-585. 14 Sandieyev, 1927, pp. 578-579. 15 Idem, pp. 579-581.</page><page sequence="7">328 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY lated in shamanistic ceremonies, e.g., in the ceremony for the curing of illness. It corresponds to the middle soul, diinda hiinehen, of Klements and Khangalov, who add that this soul corresponds not only to the appearance of man, but to the physical condition of its resident body. If the man owns a horse, the second soul rides the same horse; it wears the same clothes; and most important, continues in this condition after death."1 The third soul of Sandleyev is the highest soul of Klements and Khangalov. It is this soul which is called on death by the chief tengeri, who is, according to the Kuda River Buryats, Esege Malan Tengeri,'7 and its passing marks the end of the mortal span of the man to whom the soul was attached. Aside from this feature, it is little distinguishable from the second soul, for both reflect the physical and social condition of the possessor in health and wealth in this life and during the life beyond.18 Petri's data on the Buryat conception of the soul agrees in the main with the foregoing accounts by Klements and Khangalov and by Sandzeyev, adding at the same time certain other attributes.19 The Buryat has three souls. As to the first, after death this soul (the chief soul) goes upward to the afterworld; there it lives for a term as it had on earth, and then is born again. The second remains on earth as a wandering being after the death of the man; this soul resembles the defunct. At night it amuses itself by frightening people, but in general it is harmless, although sometimes it may attach itself to sick or drunken men and cause much harm. The third soul is called mu (literally bad, evil) by both Khanga- lov and Klements and Petri.20 This soul remains with the body, and when the corpse disappears, the body vanishes. The chief soul may have a good or bad character, according to the character of the man in whom it dwelled. If this soul was that of a good man, it is asked by the kinsmen to intercede on their behalf before the tengeri. If the deceased had an evil character, then this soul too is evil and dangerous; it is the cause of suffering to children, and of female illnesses among women. It must be placated by propitiatory offerings of sheep. Petri's observations were drawn from the Kuda River Buryats, a branch of the western Buryats, i.e., among those farthest from the influences of Buddhism and Lamaism. It is therefore interesting to note the spread of the doctrine of rebirth and transmigration as a trait diffused from the Buddhist world.

His data add another dimension still, the relation between soul worship (propitiatory sacrifices, prayers for inter- cession) by close kin. M. E. Opler and A. I. Hallowell have reported on the close relations between in-group sentiments and the attitudes of the living toward the dead in Jicarilla and Saulteaux communities. It has been noted that the suppression of the resentments, hatreds, or fears toward living kin takes expres- sion as the projection of these sentiments into the animal embodiments of the spirits of the dead. Among the Buryats an opposite inversion takes place: nega- tive sentiments toward men of ill character continue after their death, for the principal soul has the same attributes as the dead man. But on death the soul acquires greater power; evil souls must therefore be propitiated and not attacked as an evil person would be. In the terms made available by this comparison, the Buryat relationship with the world of life and death is pragmatic, manipulative, and optimistic, for in the struggle to master his fate, there are control-bearing techniques at man's disposal. It will be recalled that a system of three social estates or classes was found among the Buryats, not during the period of Russian domination but in the immediately preceding era, and this social structure is still preserved in the mythology and cosmology of the Buryats. Not only has this formation been noted by outside observers, it also has been verbalized--this is the crucial consideration -by Buryats themselves. The triple division is arranged in hierarchical form- always highest-middle-lowest. This triple division and hierarchization is then re- peated within one of the divisions, for instance, in the three grades of the highest spirits, or in the case of the three souls which together form one of the composite parts of the human being.21 The number three and its multiples (9, 90, 99) are constantly recurrent in Buryat mythology and ceremonial. The number of major communial sacrifices, tailgan, during the year is three.22 The bride at the wedding ceremonial feeds the hearth in the husband's tent three times with bits of fat, then sprinkles the garments of the husband's father three more times with fat.23 The shaman can cure a sick Buryat but has the power to prolong the man's life only for three or nine years--and seven as well.24 The heavenly spirits, tengeriner, are 99 in number; 3 and 9 occur as the combination, division, and order upon which the 21 On hierarchization, cf.

The number 7 is an intrusive variant on the basic 3-9 system. Only 3 and 9, and not 7, are mentioned in another version of the account of the number of years a man's life can be prolonged.25 BURYAT SHAMANISM The shaman is an ecstatic, a soul-projector, a spirit-master; he has special powers over and special relations to the extra-mundane sphere. These powers he obtains through a special gift, having undergone a specific kind of experience of self-abnegation and vision-quest. Accompanying the shaman-cult are a number of rites and myths relating to the worship of rocks, high places and peculiar features of the landscape; of fire and the hearth. The shaman is often a trans- vestite who may be of either sex, a highly nervous person, one subject to nervous disorders; his powers, when they are not disposed to harm mankind, are sought in the cure of (psychosomatic) illness. These are general traits of shamanism in its distribution from the Caspian Sea to the Bering Strait. I leave open the ques- tion of shamanism in South Asia and in the Western Hemisphere. In regard to the peoples of the north, Ohlmarks has distinguished two types of shamanism, the "great" shamanism of the peoples of the Arctic littoral and tundra, and the "little" shamanism of the peoples of the taiga and to the south of the taiga. The Arctic shaman is a true aberrant, subject to unmistakable psychically-meditated seizures. To restate Ohlmarks' position, the status of the Arctic shaman is a highly personalized one, for he is outside his society; the means whereby he has achieved his status is likewise highly personalized, for he has established his relationship to the spirit world through his own quest. The sub-Arctic shaman in this view is only a quasi-shaman; characteristically, he is not self-led into his trance but is narcotized, stimulated, or depressed into the shaman's state. He achieves his status through training, indoctrination, the trap- pings of institutionalization, as opposed to the charisma of the Arctic shaman.26 One significance of this contribution is that it views shamanism neither as a single, unanalyzable entity, nor as a phenomenon too complex for generalization, and varying from people to people. Furthermore, it distinguishes that which is constant, such as the trance or fit or seizure, and that which is variable, the method of inducement of the shaman's spell, of which there are roughly two. On the other hand, it oversimplifies the relationship between the shaman and the spirit world, the relationship between the shaman and society, and the relationship 25 Batarov, p. 13. 26 Ohlmarks, 1939, passim.</page><page sequence="10">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 331 between the shaman and his calling. These may be shown to vary according to the complexity of organization of the society, and the societies of Siberia are simplest in their organization in the extreme north, and become more complex the farther south they dwell. The Chukchi, the Eskimo, the Koryak of the Arctic coast and tundra have the simplest organization and the most personalized role and quest of the shaman. The Yakut, the various Tungusic peoples, and indigenes of the Altai (Turks and Turkicized Samoyeds) have a more complex social organization and the beginnings of institutionalization of shamanism, in terms of a quasi-hereditary transmission of the calling and a professional relationship of master shaman to disciple.27 The Buryats are the most complexly organized of the peoples under discussion, are closest to the great civilizations, and are endowed with the most favorable environmental conditions of them all. They continue that form of shamanism which existed among the Mongols during the era of Chingis Khan (13th century). Under Chingis Khan, in the early days of his rule, the head of one descent line, the Ba'arin, in which the specialization of shamanism was hereditary, supplied him with his Arch-priest.28 The nephew of Chingis Khan was named Yesiinge, forming another point of contact between the modem Buryat shamanism and the medieval Mongols. Among the Buryats, the shaman-candidate at the time of his initiation has nine assistants called yihiingiit, literally the nine (yesiin/yibiin- nine) .29 It is necessary to distinguish between the receipt of the shamanist power or gift which descends upon the subject after the death of the shaman-kinsman, and the shamanist status into which the subject is born. The former is quasi-hereditary, and is found chiefly among the people of the taiga; the latter is fully hereditary, and is found chiefly among the medieval Mongols, whose steppe lay to the south of the Buryat, in what is today Outer Mongolia. In addition to this form of shamanism, the fully hereditary, the Buryats also have the quasi-hereditary. In the quasi-hereditary shamanism, the power is not inherent in a descent line, for the kinsman from whom it was transmitted to the shaman in question may have received the gift personally, from no one else in his kin group.30 Where the shaman is a member of a shamanist descent line, i.e., where members may become shamans by right of birth, this right is a hereditary speciali- 27 Mikhailovskiy-Wardrop, pp. 85 fT.; Shirokogorov, pp. 74-75; Dyrenkova, pp. 267-268.

And this very specialization of function contributes to the greater complexity of organization of the society. The nascent development of a hereditary priesthood was noted at the turn of the century "which keeps up not only the education of the people, but also the memory of the achievements of their ancestors."31 This is not to say that personally, as opposed to institu- tionally and hereditarily endowed shamans, do not exist among the Buryats, but they are of an inferior status, possess an inferior spiritual power, and cannot com- pete with the hereditary shaman. Sandleyev has made the categorical statement32 that the shaman's office is open only to those who have shamans among their ancestors; the ordinary person cannot become a shaman. It may be that Sand- ieyev's report, valid for the 1920s, marks the end of the line, the final outcome of the tradition. Klements, who worked with Khangalov's materials gathered two or three gen- erations earlier, in the last third of the 19th century, qualifies this view: the Buryat shamans (which ones are not specified) believe in their origin from the eagle, son of a tengeri, and maintain long genealogies. Although any Buryat can become a shaman if the call descends on him, yet he would find himself unable to compete with other shamans who had a descent line from shamans and a series of shaman ancestors. These ancestral shamans mediate for their client and help him. The hereditary shamans are helped in another way, for they begin to learn their busi- ness from infancy on.33 These shamans, far from being solely the aberrant, charismatic voyagers in the spirit world as they are in northern Siberia, were a veritable political force among the Buryats. At the end of the 18th century, after about one hundred and fifty years of Russian contact and rule in the area, the shamans of western Baikalia sought to seize the political power for themselves: they had learned the lesson of political combination. However, they did not learn it too well, for the Russians suppressed the revolt and established the office of hereditary prince (tayji/tayja) among these Buryats, and thus a lay ruler over all western Buryats was set up for the first time.34 The Buryat shaman is as bold in relation to the spirits as he was in political matters; often he is overbold. Once the shamans possessed unlimited power, ac- cording to an origin myth, but one mighty shaman bit the cheek of Erlen Khan (the high god of the dead) in a struggle, and their power has since diminished, 31 Klements, p. 15. 32 Sandieyev, 1928, p. 977. 33 Klements, p. 15. 34 Khangalov, 1894, p. 113.</page><page sequence="12">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 333 because of this defiance. Khangalov recounts a great contest between a shaman and an emissary of Esege Maln Tengeri (a chief of the spirits) with much trickery involved and transformations from human to animal form. It is difficult to say who has won, for while the shaman must die eventually and live among the tengeri, serving them and interceding with them on behalf of his kin and descendants, nevertheless he has succeeded in prolonging his life.35 The shaman's relation with the spirit world is a dual one: he is seized by spirits for his future calling; but he uses the power thus derived to seize the spirits (souls of the dead and emissaries of the high gods) to his own ends. The power of the shaman is a dangerous power; it is ambivalent: the same spirit can be malignant to one person and beneficent to another.36 Sacrifices and shamanistic rites can effect some control over the activities of the spirits, and eventually the Buryat is thrown back on the power of the shaman who acts with confidence and hope- fulness, but not always with success. Castren has characterized the b6xoldoy as that spirit which is in the service of the shaman. Batarov calls it the spirit of a dead shaman.37 These spirits or souls (for now they are one) are again ambivalent beings, for they work both good and harm. There are two sources of sickness and death; one, by decision of Erlen Khan (Erlin Khan, Erlen-nomon-khan), the other, by inadvertency. The former source, by decision of the highest order of being, is regular, in the nature of things, a stabilized matter-although it too can be temporarily averted by a shamanistic intervention. The source of disease and death by inadvertency is at- tributed to the actions of the b6xoldoy; and the malignant activities of these beings may be bought off by sacrifices. These b6xoldoy have different degrees of power, depending on the power of the shaman during his life. Thus, there is a continuation of the attributes of being from this world to the next among shamans as among ordinary people. More than this, Batarov makes use of the Buryat word utxa/udxa in describing how the varying degrees of power of the b6xoldoy depend on the power of the shaman during his life. The term udxa means pri- marily essence, significance, but it also means descent, origination (Cheremisov, s. v.) ; it is rendered as ancestral spirit by Sandveyev."3 After death, these shamans remember their kin and help them in sickness and death. The ideas of innateness, immanence, and of inheritance and descent are joined in the Buryat world-view. The shaman's power is not his own, but that of his descent line's, just as the 35 Khangalov, 1890, pp. 19-23. The legend becomes an origin myth of the west Baikal Buryats, the Bulagat and Ekirit. 36 Sandieyev, 1927, p. 933. 37 Castrin, p. 169; Batarov, p. 10. 38 Sandieyev, 1928, p. 977.</page><page sequence="13">334 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY individual in the Buryat society is not a fully articulated being, but is the mo- mentary incumbent of the earthly existence of his lineage. The demonstration of the last statement rests on analysis of the Buryat pattern of kinship and lineage and the practices of inheritance, and must be left to another occasion. The shaman has been regarded thus far as a single, undifferentiated kind of being, albeit one with a dual relation to the spirit world, that of seizing and that of being seized, of controlling and of being controlled; and his power has been regarded as single, i.e., ambivalent only in the sense that it is powerful, easily out of control and dangerous to manipulate. This, of course, requires the most careful estimation of his capacities by the shaman; for if he undertakes a task beyond his powers, he may be crushed by the spirit whose control he has lost, and his client crushed as well. However, there are two types of shamans, two sets of relations to the spirit world, and two kinds of shamanist power. The shamans and their spiritual powers and relationships are divided as good and evil, white and black; the good shamans, together with the good powers and the good heavenly spirits not only have a color opposition with the evil, white versus black, they have also an opposing compass direction. The location of the good is in the west, the evil and black in the east.89 There is a brief intimation in one report40 that the black shamans are less the masters of and more in the service of the evil spirits. The implication is that man is by his nature more prone to good; that if the shaman were not seized by evil, his control of the spirits would work for the weal of man. Thus, in addition to the dual relationship of the shaman to the spiritual powers, and the dual source of shamanism (by heredity and by charisma), there is the dual nature of the shamans (white and black), and two kinds of shamanist consecrations as well.41 There are distinctive terms for both male shamans and female.42 The white shamans preside at births, adoptions, weddings, illnesses, and deaths; the black shamans are invoked against illness primarily.43 Only the good shamans are remembered; the bad are gradually forgotten by their people. Every dead shaman-white, i.e.-as far as he possibly can, continues to aid and protect his kinsmen and descendants, and the good shaman is a powerful source of sup- port in the struggle against disease and death. These spirits of past shamans intercede on the part of their kin before the mighty powers of heaven-that is, 39 Agapitov and Khangalov, p. 46 f.; Sandceyev, 1927, p. 933; Khangalov, 1890, p. 1 f. 40 Agapitov and Khangalov, loc. cit. 41 Idem, pp. 44-45. 42 Idem, p. 41; Sandieyev, 1928, p. 778. 43 Khangalov, 1890, p. 85.</page><page sequence="14">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 335 before the good, white, western spirits and tengeriner. Therefore, every locality, every clan, every ulas has its separate spirits, the souls of dead shamans and shamanesses who act for their kinsmen-neighbors.44 On death they usually go to dwell on a neighboring mountain or wood, and are therefore called xada ilan ibog&amp;d, forest-mountain-ancestors or elders. Each individual kin-village has its own mountain elders to whom offerings and sacrifices are made at communal rites-and individual rites as well. These spirits have significance only for their own people and are not honored by others.45 The relationship between communal rites and the kinship structure will be examined below. So much for the white shamans. The black shamans on the other hand are not honored after death; instead they are forgotten. They are not honored during their lifetimes either; they are feared. However, they are brought in during times of crises to intercede before the evil spirits, the eastern tengeri and their minions. The Buryat family or kin group faced with a threat or disaster will usually bring in an outside black shaman to shamanize on its behalf. He then returns to his own people after effecting a cure; should one of his own group then die, the black shaman is suspect, for he is thought to have borrowed a soul of one of his own kin to cure that of another. Evil influences are central to the Buryat theory of psychosomatic disease-they distinguish these from such matters as breaking a leg, etc.-and soul-borrowing is central to the theory of curing.46 There is also a mode of substituting an animal for a human being in the case of illness and death.47 One of the most famous black shaman lineages was that of Tarsay. A Buryat of the Tarsay ulas came to live in the Kulunkun ulas of the Kuda River Buryats, and there married a daughter of a black shaman. From their union were born two sons who likewise became black shamans; from the younger son descended the line of black shamans notorious for their power at the end of the 19th cen- tury. In this notice a number of traits are evident. The status of the black shaman is hereditary just as the white is, and is inherent in a descent line. The residence pattern is inverted, for the marriage is matrilocal: the husband is the foreigner, not the wife. The black shamanist power descends in the maternal line to the grandsons, and specifically to the younger son rather than the elder, although the elder too was a black shaman. All the relevant patterns of Buryat life have been inverted in this genealogy and the powers it sustains (and which sustain it): 44 Idem, pp. 83-84. 45 Idem, p. 84. 46 Idem, p. 85; for comparative Yakut material cf. Mikhailovskiy-Wardrop, p. 92. 47 Sandieyev, 1927, p. 938.</page><page sequence="15">336 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY descent, marriage, residence, and succession. The power in this line is double black because the founding ancestor was a stranger and his wife the daughter of a black shaman. A similar account of the foreign origin of a black shaman is found in the genealogy of a then-famous line, the OboSsin on the north shore of Lake Baikal.4 That the shamanist calling can be inherited in the female line is also attested by Sandveyev49 who gives the genealogy of his shaman-informant Batta. This shaman's ancestor in the ninth generation was a foreigner who came to the Buryat country from Mongolia. In this case, the shaman was a white and not a black practitioner. In both the white and black practice of the shaman's art, the normal patterns and values of Buryat life are inverted, possibly more so in the black than in the white, but that difference is minor. The important consideration is that both dare to call up powers which are dangerous both to the shaman, to his kin, and to his client-kin or not. While the shaman's call is hereditary, that is, is innate in a given descent line, it is arbitrary rather than regular: not everyone in the lineage is called, but only those who are psychologically predisposed. The shaman, because of his nervous and psychic aberrancies, is a difficult person in social life; the Buryats regard the shaman as the worst kind of man."" They are so regarded for several reasons. First of all, they are individualists, odd, abnormal, queer, in a society noted for its communal living; second, because they live in a hectic, excited manner, and in a dangerous world which is not the world of everyday life. Because of their life in the mid-world they perform services special to themselves, and are respected, honored, feared for these services. The Buryat shaman is an anomalous person, even as a shaman, for while he is a psychologically unstable individual, nevertheless his social position has been stabilized as an occupational group and as a descent line. The shaman's social position has led one observer, Petri, to believe that there is actually a schooling to which the shaman is submitted."1 It is clear that their training and their social status are both more formalized than are the training and status of shamans in the less complex societies of northern Siberia. The shamans among the Buryats have their disciples, and form, not a set of isolated individuals, but a social group apart from the rest of Buryatdom. Sandieyev has written of the social costs in the training of the shaman, which are defrayed by the entire kin-group.52 In 48 Khangalov, 1890, pp. 86-87. 49 Sandi-eyev, 1928, p. 978. 50 Idem, p. 983. 51 Petri, 1923, pp. 18-19. 52 Sandieyev, 1928, p. 982; cf. also Schmidt, pp. 432-436.</page><page sequence="16">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 337 the accounting of his social role, one must reckon in the fear and dysnomia which are embodied in his powers. These powers have their spiritual origin. The shaman repays the social cost with his religious and psychiatric services. Because the shamans among the Buryats are a group of specialized occupation, and not a group of pure individualists, they have their own ideology of religion, and their own doctrines. Petri53 depicts their religious thought in terms of doc- trinary disputation, religious reform, etc. This statement contains a measure of truth because there is ample testimony to the high degree of religious culture of the Buryats which could only have been produced by a specialized group with sufficient leisure to engage in such speculations. The existence of the Buryat shamans as a specialized social and occupational group is a mark of the complex society and economy of the Buryats. THE SMITHS, BLACK AND WHITE Another special occupational group beside the shaman, one also formed in lineages, and in whose line of descent a mystical power inheres is the smith. There is a special group of heavenly spirits called the Smiths (darxad), and the prac- titioners of the craft on earth are descended from one of them-although which varies according to the group supplying the information. There are also two kinds of smiths-good and evil-white and black."4 The good smith-spirits protect men from the eastern spirits generally, not only the eastern smith-spirits. The chief of the good smith spirits is Bozintoy, who had nine sons and one daughter: this western smith-spirit taught men the art of iron-working by the Tunkinsk moun- tains, and settled there. The smiths of this Buryat group (the Tunkin Buryats) are called sagani darxad (sagan, white) by virtue of this origin myth."5 A close variant of this myth is given by Sandieyev."5 The white smiths (human) of the Balagan Buryats-both they and the Tunkin are western Buryats-have their own family and lineage spirits, and thus form a group or groups of common descent apart from the rest of the Balagan Buryats. These spirits of the Balagan white smiths have their own ongon or spirit represented in the form of a doll. Black smiths are not reported in this group.57 The craftsmanship of the Buryats in the working of metals, both iron and silver was admired by the 18th century voyagers among them."5 Their knowledge 53 Petri, 1923, p. 18. 54 Khangalov, 1890, pp. 38-39. 55 Idem, p. 39. 56 Sandieyev, 1928, p. 539 f. 57 Khangalov, 1890, p. 73. 58 Gmelin, vol. 1, p. 707 f.; Georgi, p. 425; cf. also Sandieyev, 1928, pp. 541-544.</page><page sequence="17">338 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY of the arts have a much higher antiquity, and have fallen into disuse of late with the increase in Russian trade articles among them. Whether there is any relation- ship between the high development of this art among the Buryats and the spiritual power of the smith has not been established. As Sandzeyev points out, the smith has always had an honored position in Mongol (including Buryat-Mongol) so- ciety, appearing as a hero or free warrior in many epics.59 Again in many steppe- nomad groups of Asia, the smith has enjoyed a tax-free status from the period of Chingis Khan and earlier, down to the present. The Africanist may find here the inverse of his picture of the social position of the smith among the Buryats. The genesis of the relationship of craft specialization to the spirit world aside, there is a similar hereditary structure of the smiths as in the case of the shamans. They not only have their own ongons and genealogies, they also have their own protective (western) spirits from whom they trace their descent.60 Iron and metal work generally are an important part of shamanism, in the paraphernalia of the shaman (metal disks, etc.). DUAL ORGANIZATION OF THE SPIRIT WORLD AND A POSSIBLE DUAL SOCIAL ORGANIZATION The division of the spirit world into forces of good and evil forms the basis for division of shamans, of smiths, and of the entire heavenly hierarchy. The highest beings are the tengeri, who are 99 in number, divided into 54 western white and good heavenly spirits and 44 eastern, black, and evil; and in addition, there is one, segin sedbek (segin-blue, sedbek-?), who is the border-marker, obo, between the two, although he is actually a western tengeri. The highest tengeri is also the oldest, for the principle of seniority applies equally to the sacred and the profane worlds. Although this senior tengeri, Khan Tyurmas Tengeri, leads the struggle of the western spirits against the eastern on behalf of man, this figure is not primary in the concern of the Buryat religionists. The principal object of their concern is the second tengeri in order of rank, Esege Malin Tengeri ("Father Bald Tengeri") who is invoked by the shaman in calling up a lesser spirit, the zayan. Each of these highest tengeri has three sons.61 What is an evi- dent instance of the projection of social values into the religious world is the constant reference to the many sons of the higher beings, in ritual numbers of 3, 9, and so forth; for this is the chief desire of the Buryat and the chief source of happiness. The sons of the highest beings form a secondary rank of higher 59 Sandieyev, 1928, p. 538. 60 Ibid. 61 Khangalov, 1890, pp. 1-2; Agapitov and Khangalov, pp. 1-2.</page><page sequence="18">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 339 being; for the highest deities are the most sacred and rarely reveal their activity; while their children, or more truly, their further descendants are in closer con- tact with man, being intercessors between earthly inhabitants and the inaccessibly distant deities.62 Parallel hierarchization of the heavenly beings exists in the case of the eastern spirits. In the origin myth of the Kuda River Buryats, a descendant of the second supreme being, Esege Malin (his son in one version) is Buxa-Noyon ("Bull Prince"): from Buxa-Noyon all Buryats are descended.63 However, certain descent lines of the western Buryats trace their ancestry to yet another supreme being, Sara Xasar Tengeri ("Yellow-Cheek-Tengeri"). This being acts as pro- tector for his descendants, who form the Sarat and Xangin clans.64 In general, all Buryat groups have their own supreme deities, either special to themselves or shared with the rest of the Buryat world; with these deities they stand in a relationship of direct descent and they invoke the deities in time of need. The supreme ancestor of a given group may be one to whom that group attributes the descent of all Buryats. One such genealogy has been transmitted by Mikhail Bogdanov,65 himself a Bulagat Buryat (west of Baikal). It is a genealogy set down in the year 1847 by Bogdanov's grandfather, and at that point, in the second ascending generation, breaks with Western tradition, and gives a true Buryat account of the descent line. It originates in the divine ancestor of all Buryats, the being who is part bull, part man, Buxa-Noyon, and his wife a shamaness. It then enumerates eighteen generations to the recorder, Bogdan, the paternal grandfather of M. Bogdanov. It accounts for the ancestor and relative seniority of at least a dozen clans and descent lines, comprising most of the Buryats living west of Lake Baikal. A more circumstantial account of the same origin myth was recorded in an earlier generation by another man of Buryat origin, Khangalov.66 Two sha- manesses found a baby in an iron cradle beside Lake Baikal; the younger sha- maness recognized it as the son of Buxa-Noyon, and they raised him as their own, naming him Bulagat, or more fully, buxa dorh6 oldohon Bulagat, Bulagat-found- under-the-bull. Bulagat played with a boy who rose out of Lake Baikal, and a meal was prepared for that boy by the shamanesses which put him to sleep (so that he would not disappear into the lake again). They then retained the boy 62 Agapitov and Khangalov, p. 2. 63 Idem, pp. 3-4. 64 Khangalov, 1890, pp. 3-4. 65 Bogdanov, pp. 92-93. 66 Khangalov, 1890, pp. 23-24.</page><page sequence="19">340 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY and raised him together with Bulagat, naming him Ekirit; each of the shamanesses took one boy for her own, the senior shamaness taking Bulagat, the junior, Ekirit. The descendants of these two boys form the two Buryat peoples of Cis-Baikalia, and each of the descent groups has its own ancestor (and ancestress) and protectors. In Bogdanov's account of the interrelation of the various segments of Buryat social organization, he divides his people first into Cis- and Trans-Baikal Buryats, which correspond to the western (or northern) and the eastern divisions; the latter he groups collectively as the Khori Buryat. The eastern Buryat are then divided into the Bulagat and Ikhirit (Ekirit), and the latter are placed on the lower course of the Angara River. The Ekirit Buryats are then further divided as the east or left bank and the west or right bank Ekirit.Y7 Now plainly this is not exhaustive of the social divisions of the Buryats; on the other hand, the communal hunt of the ancient Buryats was conducted on the basis of a formation in two great wings or divisions. Whether this is an indigenous Buryat trait or one borrowed from the higher military organization of the Mongols to the south cannot be discussed here."8 Traces of a system of dual organization may be found in many sectors of the Altaic world; e.g., the ancient Mongols were divided in their socio-military organization into two wings, the right bariin and the left, dziin. The latter survives to this day as a place name in Inner Asia: Dzungaria, the country of the left (west) hand or left flank. Traces of dual organization may be found also among the Kalmuks, the Turks of Turkestan and of the Altai. The concept of dual organization of the spirit world as being coairdinate with the dual organization of the social world is offered with considerably greater reservation than that of the triple division of the two worlds as mutual reflexes of each other. The triple division of both worlds is a conceptualization of the Buryats themselves, that of the dual organization is not; three is a magic number, two is not; the triple has been more fully explored and conceptualized by the Buryat philosopher. THE SACRIFICIAL RITES OF THE KIN-COMMUNITIES The communal sacrifices of the Buryats, tailgan, are rites undertaken by kin- ship groups of varying size, from the ulas or village community to the lineage and the clan as a whole, depending on the importance of the rite and its occasion. These sacrifices are distinguished from private rites or those performed by a 67 Bogdanov, p. 39. 68 Vambotsyrenov, p. 32; Khangalov, 1888, p. 6.</page><page sequence="20">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 341 family, rites which are called kirik.69 The tailgan may be conducted for any one of a number of reasons: as a propitiatory offering to influential spirits which the ulas regards as its own; as popular festivals on the occasion of seasonal clan gatherings; in the face of calamity, such as an epidemic or an epizoStic.70 The cost of these sacrifices is borne by the participating households; the para- phernalia in addition to the animals to be offered (horses, sheep, cattle) are milk-brandy (tarasun), wine, fire for purification of the participants, and the shaman's implements. Having purified themselves by going by or through a fire, the members then proceed to the traditional place of sacrifice, on a hillside near the ulas- or the clan-center. Thus far we have two of the more significant accom- panying traits of shamanism-the fire-ceremonial and the role of high places. The Buryat ulas has spirits which it does not share with other ulases, even though these others may be all related as members of a common lineage and of a common clan. The spiritus loci of a given ulas are beseeched for protection and support; these spirits are called bimal burxan, descended or manifest Burkhan. On the other hand, there are certain manifest Burkhans who are worshipped by great numbers, and have lost their significance as local spirits.7' Certain manifest Burk- hans reside in mineral springs and have great powers of healing attributed to them.72 The term Burkhan occurs throughout the Mongol world as a designation for the Buddha; however, it has become generalized to mean deity, god, spirit. At minor tailgans the shamans play no role, at least among the Alar Buryats.73 Another set of spirits which is particular to a given community and shared by no others is comprised by the souls of dead good shamans to whom their kin and descendants look for guidance and protection.74 The great ceremonial or tailgan of the Balagan Buryats is that performed to the western Khans (deities just below the Tengeris in rank). It is conducted in the spring, and the entire clan gathers on a mountainside, facing south in a row with the senior and most respected clan-members in the west, the lesser members in the east. (Married women, widows, and girls who have passed menarche are not permitted to participate.)71 In the course of the ritual, when the sacrifice itself has been completed, the shaman becomes Buxa-Noyon, the Bull-god, and 69 Klements, pp. 14-15. 70 Agapitov and Khangalov, pp. 36 ff.; Klements, loc. cit.; Petri, 1925, pp. 5-6. 71 Agapitov and Khangalov, p. 38; Shashkov, p. 24. 72 Shashkov, p. 27. 73 Potanin, vol. 4, p. 80. 74 Khangalov, 1890, pp. 83-84. 75 Cf. Petri, 1925, pp. 15-18. On the other hand, Petri points out that pregnant women can join in one specific tailgan.</page><page sequence="21">342 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY butts at the participants and at the altars and birch-trees set up by the place of sacrifice. After butting, he goes off in the southwestern (the holiest) direction, and cries nine times on the way. Thus the participants know that he is leaving the ceremonial entirely, and that it is over.76 Other, lesser ceremonials are built around the driving away of evil spirits from a household by a shaman, and the fire purification ceremony here is central.77 Again, in the organization of the tailgan, the entire clan is divided into groups of more closely related kin, so that the distribution at the sacrifice is the same as that in the profane world. Each sub-group within the clan or lineage has its own camp, its own fire and sacrificial altar, carries on its own rites, and makes its own animal-offerings.78 In the genealogy recounted by Bogdanov,79 he de- scribes the formation of four lineages, urag, founded by four brothers, in the seventh ascending generation from himself. Each of the lineages was in existence in the first decades of this century. The great-grandfather of Bogdanov, Marxay, together with his brother Bayanxi, were the founders of two ulases, for each had three sons and a rich progeny. However, the two ulases were formed only recently, around the turn of the century, and until that time the descendants of Mald'igi had lived in one ulas for approximately a century, and lived as a unit, joining in making arrangements for marriage, in communal hospitality and in the tailgan. Of late, i.e., since the turn of the century, they rarely came together in the tailgan as a group. On the other hand, grandsons of the three brothers, Bogdan, Aleksei, and Osodoy, joined in the tailgan.s0 (We have, by the way, an excellent criterion for degree of acculturation in the adoption of Russian names by the Buryats which increases with each generation.) We have thus a detailed account of the close correlation between the organization of the communal sacrifice and the organiza- tion of the Buryat kinship system. There are a number of taboos to which women are submitted. It is clear from the nature of these taboos that women are never fully adopted into their husbands' clans on marriage, unlike the Manchus. They cannot participate in the husband's clan sacrifices, and are barred from the tailgan of the natal kin as well from menarche on. Menstruation is regarded by Petri8s as a mark of ritual uncleanli- ness. Women are also subject to another taboo. On the birth of a son, a rope of 76 Khangalov, 1890, pp. 116-117. 77 Idem, p. 112. 78 Bogdanov, p. 94. A description of a tailgan bearing much the same import is to be found in Curtin, pp. 44-45. 79 Bogdanov, pp. 92-93. 80 Idem, pp. 92-94. 81 Petri, 1925, pp. 10-11.</page><page sequence="22">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 343 horse-hair is stretched across the family tent, and only closely related women can come under the rope to enter the tent, such as the wife's mother, and then only after purification. Women from the farther end of the ulas cannot enter; nor can the husband's sister, for she has married out of the kin-group. Petri comments on the Buryat concept of their co-religionists: Tungus women come under the same interdiction as Buryat women-"the shamanistic faith is the same." But Russian women are not subject to this taboo because they fall under a different religious Buxa Noyon 12 generations Xadayxan Xapxan Xapxai Xarinay Mugan Barluk Maldfigi Nayanay Balban Batayxan Bayanxi Marxay Pavel Petrushki Petrov Bogdan Aleksei Osodoy (c. 1847) Nikolai Mikhail Nikolaevich Bogdanov (c. 1920) system. The Buryats regard their religion and that of the Tungus as the same, for they have the same gods in common. Unfortunately, this comment by Petri has not been corroborated elsewhere. The role of women in the religious practices and concepts of their husbands and fathers may be viewed in a different manner from that of the ritual impurity of menstruation, although the two views complement each other, relative to the lower ritual and social status of Buryat woman. The Buryat kin-community, whether the village, the lineage, or the clan, has spirits which it does share with broader kin groupings. The girl until her marriage, which is a time approximately</page><page sequence="23">344 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY coincident with menarche, is a member of her natal kin group, and may partici- pate in its ceremonies. From another point of view, she may participate or not, for her presence does not count--she has no social, religious, or legal personality as yet. When she comes of age, she achieves a certain measure of social personality, but it is ambivalent, for she never fully leaves her father's group, she never fully joins her husband's. She is, therefore, never fully divested of the spiritual influ- ences of her father's line, even though she undergoes the rite of fire-purification as part of the wedding ceremony, a rite which is designed to keep out the antipathetic, foreign spirits. For while these spirits are not per se malignant, they would not combine peacefully with the local spirits. The pregnant woman can attend the tailgan of her husband's community, because the spirit of her husband's line is within her, in the child she will bear. Finally there is the one great tailgan in which all Buryats, both men and women, join; it is not specific to any one line of descent, or to any particular body of spirits. Each Buryat descent line has a spirit or spirits particular to itself, inherent within itself. The smallest group, the ulas or village-kin-community, has a spirit of its own in addition to that which it shares with other villages as joint members of a lineage; each lineage has its own spiritual relations and powers specific to itself, and others still which it shares with other lineages as joint members of a clan; each clan has its own set of spirits and spiritual relations which it holds, and which in their turn hold the clan apart from all other Buryat clans. Finally there is the entire pantheon of Buryat spirits which govern all things, and which the Buryat shaman seeks to manipulate in the interests of his group and of himself. In this way we establish the broadest and at the same time the most intricate correlations between the worlds of the sacred and the profane, between the religious order and the order of society. The inner hierarchy of the spirit world parallels the composition and articulation of the Buryat descent lines; and these descent lines are the all-embracing units of Buryat social organization, for they comprise within themselves the class strata and the specialized occupational groups. THE EXTENDED FAMILY, THE HEARTH-SPIRIT, AND THE WEDDING The Buryat kin-village is composed of extended families, and these extended families are the microcosms of Buryat society, with all the characteristic features of that society. The extended family too has its own spirits in the form of hearth- spirits and ongons which it shares with no other family, while at the same time joining with the other neighboring families in the invocation, exhortation, or pro-</page><page sequence="24">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 345 pitiation of spirits venerated in common. The hearth-spirit is the house-deity, the defender of the tent of the family, and each tent or yurt has one.82 This spirit looks like a man, but during his stay in the fire he is small. . ... One must not poke the fire with a knife or anything else that is sharp, for one can thus poke out the eye of the fire spirit accidentally. The householder will then suffer mis- chance. The fire spirit when he is blind cannot protect the family of the host very well against evil spirits, since he keeps sharp watch that they do not come into the yurt. Moreover, the descendants of the household can become blind in such cases; like fire spirit, so householder.83 The son or brother who leaves the family when a family divides, takes with him the fire from the common family hearth, which he lights in the new yurt; here a new fire spirit appears. To the question whence he comes, the Buryat answers: "As many children as you have, just that many does the fire spirit of your hearth have." It is clear that we have in the given case the same principle of the mutual dependence between the condition of the spirit of the fire and that of the householder. Hence the saying exists among the Buryats in regard to a family that has died out, "Their hearth fire has died out."s84 The fire is the symbol of fertility of the family, and as part of the wedding ceremony, the bride must feed the fire with bits of fat, which she does three times, symbolizing by the enrichment of the fire the enrichment of her own marriage and of her husband's descent line through the birth of many children. The fire in the new yurt has been brought there from the husband's father's yurt by the husband's mother, symbolizing likewise the continuity of the line from father to son.85 On the birth of a son, the wife bows to the fire again in the Balagan Buryat ritual.8" One final relationship between kinship and the religious ritual remains to be described, that of the avunculate. Unlike many other societies which are organized on an agnatic principle, the Buryats do not assign a great role to the relationship between the mother's brother and the sister's son. There is, however, one for- malized relationship between the two whereby the sister's son is forbidden entry into the house of the mother's brother if he does not wear a taboo belt.

This strangulation was performed by the sister's son (or the daugh- ter's son: the term z? has both meanings) by means of a special belt. Before the strangulation, the zE offered to his mother's brother a gift of fat. It is this belt which is no longer worn for fear of committing a great sin as well as insult to the mother's brother. At the wedding ceremony, the sister's son continued to offer at the time of the report a gift of fat to the mother's brother."7 CONCLUSION In the foregoing pages the principal features of the Buryat religion in its relationship to the social organization have been set forth. The formative princi- ples upon which Buryat society is based may be reduced to the following: descent in the paternal line from a single common ancestor, and hence the agnatic rela- tionship among all the descendants; the concentric organization of these agnatic kin into extended families grouped into kin-villages, kin-villages grouped into lineages (these are the units of exogamy); lineages grouped into clans, and clans into clan confederations and principalities. The descent groups are collaterally ranked by the principle of primogeniture, which forms the basis of social differ- entiation into the aristocratic (primogenitary) and the commoner social strata; to this dichotomy, a stratum of slaves was subordinated, forming a triple class- division of society. There exist also descent lines of shamans and smiths, forming groups of specialized occupation. The joint concepts of division and hierarchization by ranking is the basis for social inequality in a society where all men trace descent generation by genera- tion from a common ancestor. These joint concepts are operative in the two worlds, the sacred and the profane, in application to the triple division of the spirits, of the human soul, of the entire being of man, and of society itself. Each group, from the extended family to the clan, takes its place in the hierarchy of Buryat society, and this hierarchy is extended to include the specialized groups: to each unit of social organization, such as an extended family, kin-village, etc., and to each level of social organization, such as the commoner stratum, there corresponds a unit or level of the spiritual hierarchy. The relations of the group to its own spirits are necessarily more intimate than those of any other group, and this despite the fact that the two groups may have spirits in common by being members of a larger inclusive group, such as villages or lineages in a clan. Therefore, a member of one lineage entering another (such as a woman in a lineage-exogamic marriage) must be purified of the spiritual influences of her 87 Idem, pp. 63-64.</page><page sequence="26">BURYAT RELIGION AND SOCIETY 347 natal group-spirits, even though both lineages may have joint spirits, joint sacri- fices and myths as members of the same clan. The spirits which are not shared, and therefore those of whose influence the new member must be purified by fire, are not per se malificent; but they are mutually antipathetic. All of earthly Buryatdom is so organized in the conception of each Buryat as to reflect in point- for-point detail the spiritual organization of the cosmos, and the spiritual organiza- tion in its turn the social, in mutual interaction. The organization of society into a series of concentric circles, to which the threefold organization of society and of the cosmos was traced is but one mode. The Buryats in a tour-de-force have been able to conceptualize the coirdination of a complex social order and an equally complex spiritual order. There is, however, another mode or order, the dual organization of the spirit world into good and evil, black and white, west and east respectively. Moreover, certain types of human beings, the shamans and smiths are likewise so divided (for the sake of simplicity I shall speak only of shamans). The dual classification does not have a real analogue in the social organization; despite certain traces of dual organiza- tion of society, no analogy can be drawn because of the overwhelming difference in emphasis between the dual in society and the dual in religion and morality. If the measure of the cosmic trichotomy was found in the society and its three strata, the measure of the dual cleavage must be sought in the Buryat shaman. The shaman is the repository of these double relations, to the good and to evil; for, regardless of whether the shaman is white or black, he has relations to both sectors of the spirit world. And these very relations to the spirit are reciprocal ones, that of possessing and that of being possessed. The relationships beyond these are also ambivalent: the good spirits protect men from the bad, yet the good spirits decree, execute, and report man's death; and evil spirits in conjunction with the force of the black shaman are invoked to prolong a man's life and stave off imminent death. The shaman's power is not intrinsically evil, any more than the spiritual influence to be purified by fire is malignant; the shaman's power in the one case, and the spiritual influence in the other, are dangerous and hence ambivalent. If they are properly channelized and controlled they are benevolent forces; the shamanist-spiritual power may on the other hand out-reach the shaman and do vast harm. The shaman maintains the most delicate balance between maximalizing and over-reaching, between curing and killing. The Buryat non-shaman is spiritually neutral, possibly with a slight balance in favor of the good; Buryat society as a whole is similarly appreciated from the viewpoint of morality. The fundamental cleavage of the social plane is that between the aberrant who is the shaman and the forces of conformity embodied</page><page sequence="27">348 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY in the organization of the society-indeed the hyper-organization of society may be inferred from the proliferation of modes of social organization of the Buryats. The shaman is the breaking away from the bounds of organization; the shaman is the transcendance by the individual of the social norm. The struggle between good and evil within the shaman as spiritual representative dramatizes the conflict between norm and ab-norm in the shaman as a man. In this attitude toward both the natural and the supernatural environments, the Buryat is daring, forceful, cunning and optimistic. The Buryat shaman and the Buryat layman both know that the parallel journey through life and through the spirit world is fear- some and beset with dangers; all Buryats know the risks and how to overcome them. The interpretation of the religious and social conceptions of the Buryats as co~rdinate is not without parallel in world ethnography; but it is rare, especially at the given degree of complexity of the two conceptual spheres. That these spheres have been coiardinated at various levels by the Buryats is the achievement of their cosmology and their social thought. They have the means to pursue and support objectification and abstraction in all spheres except that of the shaman himself.
