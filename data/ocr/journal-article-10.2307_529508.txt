Ewers summarized this position best. . . . I cannot believe that the Plains Indian life in the Horse Culture Period . . . did not differ qualitatively as well as quantitatively from Plains Indian life in the Pedestrian Culture Period. The use of horses not only enriched the material culture of the tribes who acquired them but it altered their habits of daily life . . . Probably the most dis- tinctive new trait of the Horse Culture Period was social rather than material in nature.4 Although this debate still continues5 it is notable that Northwestern Plains archaeologists have made little contribution to its resolution, even though many of the classic Historical Period equestrian tribes inhabited this region, and an understanding of pre-horse period Plains Indian culture is obviously basic to these arguments. (It should be noted here that archaeologists in other areas of the Plains have directed themselves to some parts of this question. The direct historic approach, used since the 1930s in the Central and Southern Plains,6 was 3. E.g., Ewers, op. cit. (in note 1); Wilson, op. cit.

Northwestern Plains rock-art sites with data relevant to this discussion. In light of the interest in the questions concerning cultural continuity and change by archaeologists work- ing in the Central Plains and Middle Missouri regions, the fact that research of this nature has yet to be fully developed for the Northwestern Plains requires ex- planation. Quite simply, the reason is largely the scarci- ty of Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric period sites in the region that might yield data relevant to these prob- lems, and the necessity of more basic cultural-ecological research in much of the area before such problems can be investigated. Rock-art sites, however, are optimally suited for providing information relevant to these questions be- cause they are detailed records of important character- istics of Northwestern Plains Indian culture that can often be reliably dated to the Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historical periods. With this in mind the rock art at Writing-On-Stone in southern Alberta was examined for evidence of changes in the Plains In- dian war complex and methods of status determination that accompanied the transition to the Historical period equestrian adaptation. The data obtained provide infor- mation concerning prehistoric Plains Indian culture and the nature of Historical period change in these Plains Indian cultural institutions. 37, 2 (1940); Lewis, op. cit.

The limited contribution of archaeology to the question of culture change among these groups is probably best illustrated by the fact that all of the ethnologists and ethnohistorians cited herein have relied upon either informants' accounts of pre-horse period culture or logical inference concerning pre-horse culture traits and institutions as the basis for com- parison of documented historical (post-horse period) culture traits and practices.8 7.

A few examples, however, which show shield- bearing warriors and V-neck anthropomorphs awk- wardly mounted on crudely-drawn boat-form horses or associated with flintlock rifles, indicate that these motifs survived into the early Historical period and lasted until ca. 1750 A.C.Il After this date ceremonial art was apparently quickly abandoned, as indicated by the absence of the characteristic motifs in the biographic art style that dominated Historical period Plains rock art. 12 Much of the ceremonial art is apparently the product of Late Prehistoric period Plains Shoshone artists. Based on the spatial and temporal distribution of the characteristic ceremonial art motifs and the almost ex- act coincidence of their distribution with the ethnohis- torically documented range of the Plains Shoshone dur- ing the Late Prehistoric and early Historical periods, shield-bearing warriors, V-neck anthropomorphs, and boat-form zoomorphs have been demonstrated to be of Shoshonean origin.l3 This conclusion is supported by the coincidence of the distribution of diagnostic Shoshone artifacts (Intermountain pottery, steatite vessels, and tubular stone pipes) with the distribution of these characteristic motifs, and by the association of such artifacts with one or more of these motifs at three Northwestern Plains sites.l4 Further support is provided by the association of pedestrian and mounted shield bearers and V-neck warriors at Writing-On-Stone with illustrations of horse armor known to have been used on the Northwestern Plains only by the Shoshone. 15 Based on the composition and content of site panels, the scarcity of depictions of secular activities, and the symbolic association of zoomorphs, anthropomorphs, and objects of apparent supernatural signiElcance, cere- 11.

In this area 58 rock-art sites (including both petroglyphs and pictographs) are located on the sheer sandstone cliffs flanking the Milk River floodplain.9 Two categories of rock art ceremonial art and biographic art - are distinguished at Writing-On- Stone. Ceremonial art is composed predominantly of shield-bearing warriors (FIG. 2e), V-neck anthropo- morphs (FIG. 2c), and boat-form zoomorphs (FIG. 2a [horse], 4a [deer/elk]).

Pictographic art exactly like the biographic rock art at Writing-On-Stone was made to decorate tipi covers, clothing, and buffalo robes by all of these tribes in the late Historical period.23 In addition, the spatial and temporal distribu- tion of the hourglass-body anthropomorph, which oc- curs in the prehistoric rock art in the south-central Canadian Woodlands and on the Northwestern Plains only in the Historical period, coincides with the migra- tion and distribution of the Blackfeet and Cree, both of whom used this motif extensively in their Historical period perishable art.24 Biographic rock art found elsewhere on the Northwestern Plains that closely resembles Writing-On-Stone rock art is attributed to several other Plains Indian tribes including the Sioux, Hidatsa, and Crow.25 b l d c l l  Figure 3.

The preponderance of horses and guns in even the earliest examples of biographic art, coupled with the stylistic criteria in- volving the development of the mature style of depict- ing zoomorphs, indicates that biographic art began after 1750 A.C.l9 when the horse and gun first became 16. Keyser, op. cit. (in note 9) 50-52. 17. The mature style of zoomorph depiction is a "fluid" style, emphasizing elongated bodies and necks with little attention paid to legs. The nose is usually left open, and often the head is simply represented by the open end of the two curved parallel lines that form the neck. Mature style zoomorphs have neither ribs nor heart-lines depicted. The overall effect of this style represents graceful movement in depictions of animals. 18. Keyser, op. cit. (in note 9) 52-54. 19.

Evidence of Change in the Plains Indian War Complex The biographic rock art at Writing-On-Stone illus- trates the documented Historical perioc} patterns of Plains Indian warfare and its relationship to status ac- quisition, but more importantly, the ceremonial art, although with distinctly different emphasis, provides in- formation about the Late Prehistoric period patterns of these same institutions that can be used to measure the extent of Historical period changes. It was originally thought that the adoption of the horse and gun had caused little change in the Plains Indian war complex26 and Historical period warfare patterns were discussed as though they had always ex- 20.

Otherwise it would be difElcult to explain the emphasis placed on performing relatively more difficult deeds (such as stealing a picketed horse, or striking a living person) when considerably less difficult actions (such as stealing a loosely-guarded herd of horses, or killing a man) would have been economically more proEltable. The changes demonstrated in Plains Indian military patterns have been organized under a series of patterns and periods (e.g., post-horse/pre-gun, horse and gun) based on the differential acquisition of both horses and guns which diffused across the plains from different sources.3' Both Lewis32 and Secoy,33 however, depend primarily on informants' descriptions of protohistorical and prehistoric warfare as a basis for inferences con- cerning the pre-contact military system. Writing-On-Stone rock art documents many of the changes described above, and provides archaeological data that support the inferences made from informants' accounts of Prehistoric period (pre-horse/pre-gun) war- fare. In prehistoric ceremonial art at Writing-On-Stone there is a single battle scene (FIG. 2b) that shows a group 27.

Several other pre- historic combat scenes (FIG. 2d, e) also show pedestrian shield-bearing warriors using similar weapons. No ex- ample of a Prehistoric period combat or battle scene ex- plicitly depicts a warrior counting coup or acquiring any war honor. Two early Historical period ceremonial art scenes drawn between approximately 1730 A.C. and 1760 A.C.34 illustrate the changes described in Secoy's35 transitional "post-horse/pre-gun" and "occasional gun" periods. One of these is a battle scene showing a small group of mounted shield bearing warriors attacking several pedestrian shield bearers and V-neck anthropomorphs (FIG. 2a). These warriors use lances and clubs and two horses wear armor. The absence of rifles and the presence of horse armor (which was abandoned after the Indians acquired the rifle36) indicate that this scene represents post-horse/pre-gun warfare. The other scene is a combat scene (FIG. 2c) that shows a mounted warrior attacking a pedestrian rifleman shooting a flint- lock. Stylistic criteria and the V-neck anthropomorph and boat-form horse date this scene to the "occasional gun" period between 1740 A.c. and 1760 A.c.37 How- ever, even though these early Historical period scenes show action in somewhat more realistic manner than Prehistoric period combat scenes, there is still no attempt to depict the acquisition of specific war honors. Historical period biographic rock art at Writing-On- Stone includes numerous combat and battle scenes in- volving both mounted and pedestrian warriors. These combatants use a variety of weapons including spears, hatchets, bows and arrows, clubs, rifles, and a sword, but only two warriors use shields and no horse armor occurs. The decline in the importance of armor with the advent of the horse and gun pattern of warfare has been previously documented,38 but the data from Writing- On-Stone suggest that the shield, although commonly used by many Plains Indian groups,39 was of less impor- tance as a status symbol in Historical period art than in Prehistoric period art. The major importance of these Historical period 34. Dewdney, op. cit. (in note 11); Keyser, op. cit. (in note 9) 23, 26, 50. 35. Secoy, op. cit. (in note 3) 33-39, 45-58. 36. Ibid. 60. 37.

Historical period combat scenes, unlike those in Prehistoric period rock art, emphasize the warrior's deeds of bravery (counting coup) rather than simply the killing of an enemy. Several scenes show unarmed or lightly armed warriors striking a better armed opponent (FIGS. 3a, d, f); one scene shows a man with a spear taking another man's rifle (FIG. 3c), and another shows a poorly-drawn warrior striking a second man with the barrel of his flintlock (FIG. 3e). The combat scene (FIG. 3b) in the center of the very detailed battle scene at site DgOv81 epitomizes the portrayal of counting coup. This combat scene, which probably represents a coup counted by the author of the entire battle scene,40 shows a hatchet- wielding warrior striking down a rifleman. Bullets ex- tending from the rifle indicate that the victorious warrior overcame superior weaponry, and a mark on the victor's chest indicates that he was wounded during the encounter. In addition to the combat scenes illustrated at Writing-On-Stone, similar Historical period combat scenes occur elsewhere in the Northwestern Plains. The best example is a scene at Castle Butte in Montana that shows a bowman taking another man's rifle.41 All of the acts depicted in these various Historical period combat scenes capturing a gun, striking a better armed foe, and being wounded in combat were considered highly esteemed war honors among the plains tribes42 including the Blackfeet, Gros Ventres, Cree, and Assiniboine who are responsible for much of the Historical period biographic rock art at Writing- On-Stone. Among the Historical period Plains Indians, success in warfare (determined by the performance of any of a series of graded war honors) was the primary determi- nant of an individual's status and rank.43 Hunting prowess was considered of secondary importance among some groups.44 The mere performance of these deeds, however, was not sufElcient for their recognition. In order to achieve status from them the deeds had to 40. Keyser, op. cit. (in note 9) 29. 41. Conner and Conner, op. cit. (in note 10) 22, Fig. 14. 42. Smith, op. cit.

(in note 43) 29. be extensively publicized and advertised.45 This publici- ty was accomplished by recounting one's feats at frater- nal gatherings and tribal ceremonies, by drawing pic- tures of them on personal equipment such as buffalo robes and lodge covers, and (as indicated by the petroglyphs and pictographs at Writing-On-Stone and elsewhere) by illustrating them at rock-art sites.46 This intimate association of status and warfare in Historical period Plains Indian culture, coupled with the documented changes in the Plains Indian war com- plex,47 suggests that the Plains Indian system of status determination probably also underwent a change from the Prehistoric to Historical periods. Although this probability has been previously recognized,48 until now no data concerning the prehistoric Plains Indian status system were available. The data from the rock-art sites at Writing-On-Stone, however, suggest that prior to the Historical period, status rested primarily on power ac- quired through the vision quest rather than by a system of graded war honors. As noted above, Prehistoric period combat scenes are rare in Writing-On-Stone rock art, and no Prehistoric period example shows an explicit depiction of a warrior counting coup. Instead, combat is usually symbolically shown with none of the realism common to Historical period art (cf. FIG. 2e and FIG. 3c) and much more attention is paid to showing the individual warrior and his equipment such items as his large shield with an heraldic design representing his guardian spirit, a lavishly decorated spear or club, or an elaborate head- dress.49 This indicates that the aspect of personal power (represented by the warrior's paraphernalia) is more im- portant than the actual event, and suggests that a system of graded war honors had yet to be developed for Plains Indian warfare. Much more common than combat scenes in pre- historic rock art at Writing-On-Stone are groups of figures that show a man in symbolic association with an animal (FIG. 4) or an object of apparent supernatural significance such as a bow-spear, a hand-held "rake," an elaborate headdress, or zig-zag "power" symbols.50 Because of their similarity to documented instances of vision-quest pictography, and their apparent super- 45.

Analysis of Shoshone, Blackfeet, Cree, Gros Ventres, and Assiniboine art, however, shows the same Prehistoric to Historical period transition in warfare practices and status determination systems in each in- stance that is documented in Writing-On-Stone rock art. Change from the Prehistoric period vision-quest records (FIG. 4) toward more biographic type drawings such as the battle scene involving mounted shield bear- ing warriors (FIG. 2a) occurs in Shoshonean rock art in the Protohistoric period at Writing-on-Stone,55 and Historical period hide paintings and ethnographic ac- counts indicate that the historical Northern Shoshone had a typical plains war complex in which status was determined by the performance of war honors which were pictographically recorded on buffalo robes.56 Black feet, Cree, Assin iboine, and G ro s Ventres art shows the same transition from the Late Prehistoric period to the Historical period. At Writing-On-Stone the Historical period rock art of these groups shows the mounted war parties characteristic of historic Indian warfare, and emphasizes war honors as status deter- minants. However, the prehistoric rock art found in the northern woodlands region of Saskatchewan and Manitoba that is attributed to these groups consists predominantly of vision-quest records showing men, animals, and supernatural symbols57 that are very similar to the prehistoric ceremonial rock art at Writing-On-Stone. Conclusions Although the changes that occurred in Plains Indian culture following the introduction of the horse and gun onto the plains have been the subject of continuing anthropological debate, Northwestern Plains archae- ologists have had little input, probably because the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric period culture patterns of the antecedents of the classic equestrian tribes that serve lllll ll F \ LX S '\1\\% 1 1 , b I Figure 4. Petroglyphs at Writing-On-Stone representing Prehistoric period vision-quest records. Scale bars equal 10 cm. natural symbolism these representations are interpreted as records of successful vision quests.Sl The prominent, exposed location of these vision-quest records and the occurrence of few war records with them implies that during the Late Prehistoric period these rock-art sites served as display for publicizing an individual's status as they did in the Historical period. However, in con- trast to the Historical period art, it is evident that what is being publicized is the relative power of a man's guar- dian spirit rather than his accomplishments. Hence, in Late Prehistoric period Plains Indian culture it seems that the major determinant of status was the spirit helper itself rather than a warrior's deeds. As indicated above, Historical period biographic art is composed predominantly of records of personal war and hunting exploits drawn at Writing-on-Stone to ad- vertise a warrior's accomplishment of noteworthy deeds. Vision-quest records of the Historical period are rare,52 suggesting that, even though the vision quest had an important position in the Historical period Plains In- dian system of status acquisition,53 it had been super- seded in importance by the performance of real deeds. This interpretation does not deny the fact that visions were closely associated with status in Historical period Plains Indian culture54 both as a means of acquiring supernatural power to serve as a basis on which to build accomplishments, and later in life (either through ob- taining a new vision or reworking the original one) as a validation on status conferred by war honors. I simply suggest that in contrast to the Prehistoric period emphasis on vision-quest experiences as the primary conferrent of status, a Historical period warrior's status was determined not by the spirit helper itself, but rather by what deeds he accomplished.

But now, my recent discoveries at Writing-On-Stone demonstrate that Northwestern Plains rock art, which spans the period between ap- proximately 1000 A.C. and 1890 A.C., provides data relevant to the patterns of Prehistoric period status determination and the Prehistoric period warfare com- plex and illustrates the changes in both that accom- panied the introduction of the horse and gun into Plains Indian culture. The rock art at Writing-On-Stone, analyzed in con- junction with the ethnohistorically and ethnographical- ly known Plains Indian culture pattern, demonstrates that Prehistoric period Northwestern Plains Indian war- fare consisted of engagements between heavily armed pedestrian "shock troops" whose motives were primari- ly economic. Warfare of this sort apparently was not of major signiElcance in determining an individual's status. Instead, the rock art indicates that the major status determinant prior to the Historical period was the relative strength or type of power acquired by a man * * * fi C UrlIlg l1S vlslon quest. Historical period rock art at Writing-On-Stone demonstrates signiElcant changes in the Plains Indian military complex. The horse and gun rapidly changed Northwestern Plains Indian warfare from the Prehis- toric period pattern to one dominated by small groups of lightly armed, highly mobile warriors whose motives became the acquisition of personal war honors.S8 Ac- companying these changes was a decline in the impor- tance of the vision quest as a primary status determi- nant and the introduction of a system of graded war honors, the performance and advertisement of which were the basis of a warrior's achieved status.

The author is aware that his description of warfare patterns is a generalization truer for the Northwestern Plains than some other areas of the Plains, but as a thematic description of Plains warfare it seems valid.
