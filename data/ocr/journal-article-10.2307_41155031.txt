<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stylistic Aspects of Linguistic Borrowing A Stylistic and Comparative View of American Elements in Modern German, and British English"* Hans Galinsky PART ONE: AMERICAN-GERMAN CONTACTS I As a central phenomenon of "languages in contact", borrowing or interference has secured a firm place in linguistics. In the area of English, attention first turned to this language as recipient, later as source language. In both spheres of interest re- search concentrated on "lexical" more than on "phonic" interference, with "grammatical interference"1 coming in a poor third. Results of observation were mostly evaluated as indices to cultural influence. As to method, the diachronic approach was predominant. It has also governed comparisons, lately increasing between the structure and the vocabulary of English, preferably Old and Middle English,2 and those of source lan- guages. The range of observation has gradually extended from British3 to American Eng- lish,4 from inter-language to intra-language or inter-dialectal contacts, with American English functioning more frequently as source than as recipient. The field being fairly recent, and possibilities of direct observation abounding, synchronie studies have been in the majority. Synchronie and diachronic research in English, both recipient and source, has tried to find reasons for interference, establish principles of borrowing, or at least apply to the English language principles established elsewhere. Such attempts, however, have rarely included the factor of style. Nor has general stylistics dealt extensively with the stylistic relevance of borrowings.

In view of the well-known difficulties inherent in the 'style in language' problem,26 style, for the purposes of this paper, is defined as a normative principle, unifying se- lection or creation of linguistic devices of communication. Consciously or unconsciously it will determine or co-determine a writer's or speaker's choice between the following: (1) available possibilities of expression within his native language; (2) these possibili- ties and those available in one or more foreign tongues he knows; (3) borrowings al- ready imported, self-imported or self-created. The definition embraces levels of usage (jStilebenen4) inasmuch as they help unify utterance, both literary and non-literary. Due to the different degrees of linguistic perceptiveness on the part of borrowers, and to the different kinds of function which AE exercises in the two areas of language contact, the term "American elements" in the American-German contact situation means any element of English spoken or written in America and imported by Germans (section II of this paper). In this situation AE often functions as an intermediary be- tween German and 'general', 'world-wide' English, less so between German and Briti- cisms of AE. In the American-British contact situation, which will be treated along comparative lines, this term is restricted to Americanisms, both of quality, i. e. Ameri- can origin, and of quantity, i. e. greater frequency of usage. The method of arrangement is a gradual advance from simpler to increasingly subtler traces of stylistic aspects of borrowing. The terminology employed is derived from Betz,27 Haugen and Weinreich. Each of the two parts of the paper will include materials which stem from an au- thor's experienced or his purely imagined contact with Americans either in America or outside of it.

It was selected as an introduction to the most prominent kind of AE interference, the lexical, and to the most obvious of its stylistic uses, the impressing of American 'atmosphere' on the German listener's or reader's mind. As the title suggests, Der gute Gott von Manhattan is a play with a New York setting. Some of its figures are American, one is European, some are metaphysical powers or agents. In radio drama it is primarily not the felt or reported setting but the figures whose reality should be brought home to the listener with lingual or other audible means. In Ingeborg Bachmann's play this is effected by touches of 'American' color provided by Americanized German. They are subtly distributed across the whole play, naturally with the American figures participating more frequently and variedly. AE interference is limited in two respects. First, it is neither phonic nor grammatical, but only lexical and phrasal. Second, within this limited area, low and medium degrees of interference are preferred to avoid spoiling the universal significance of the theme of fate-determined love vs. the ego. On the whole, the speech of the European visitor, whose first name Jan might suggest a Dutchman, a Flemish-speaking Belgian or a North German, adjusts much less to English than Jennifer, the American college girl, does to non-native speech. Their linguistic behavior clearly corresponds to their different adaptability in love. As to the degrees and kinds of AE interference, zero interference is represented by Jennifer talking about a Tanzfest in der Universität** Party, one of the most frequent German transfers from English, particularly characteristic of German middle class teenager and student talk,30 is evaded. An interference, minimal, though comprising a whole sentence, emerges in the "loan translation proper",31 Grins und ertrag es** (Grin and bear it). The choice of Grins is affected by homophony and semantic simi- larity. The idiomatic equivalent "Mach' gute Miene zum bösen Spiel!"33 is not made use of, as it fails to suggest American atmosphere. The phrasal loan translation küßt mich zur Guten Nachfi* (&lt;kisses me good night), once again exploiting cognates, reveals the author's resistance to grammatical interference: the German 'function word + definite article' contraction 'zur' has been retained. Lexical interference of a low degree appears in the compound Luftmaschine** ^air- conditioner). It presents neither a loan translation proper nor a "loan creation"36 such as German Klimaanlage, Klimagerät or less habitual Klimaregler. It is a newly coined "loan rendition".37 Luft renders 'air', but maschine follows the French-influenced 29 Op. cit., 15. 80 Cf. also such compounds as ,Keller-Party' and ,Party-Anzug' 81 Weinreich, Languages in Contact, 51. 82 Op. cit., 76. 88 Langensdieidťs Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the English and German Languages, PL I: English-German, First Volume A-M, Completely Revised, ed.

'machine à écrire') for modem German technical tools.88 Thus "the model compound" 'air-conditioner' "only furnishes a general hint for the reproduction" or, more specifically, only one element of "the model is reproduced exactly".39 Not lexical but semantic interference, presenting yet another subdivision of 'loan translation',40 occurs in the following sentence: "... Hunderte von Leichen wurden in den Trauerhäusern manikürt, geschminkt und zur Schau gestellt."41 Trauerhäusern most probably translated 'funeral homes', an institution of modern American life which, plentiful and well-advertized as it usually is, will not be overlooked by any foreigner. The translation, if it is not an outright misunderstanding on the part of the author,42 entails a semantic extension from the private to the professional and commercial sphere. Familiar as he is only with the private meaning of 'Trauerhaus' as 'a house of mourn- ing', ' house or family gone into mourning', a unilingual speaker of German will not grasp this extension of meaning. It is facilitated by both the semantic similarity of 'Haus' and 'home', and the semantic equivalence of 'Trauer-' and 'funeral' in such combinations as 'Trauerzug, 'funeral procession', or 'Trauermarsch', 'funeral march'. Interference would seem to increase with "Sie müssen zurück um einen ganzen Block".49 Admittedly, the lexical item may be interpreted as a semantic extension of G 'Block', facilitated by the fact that it belongs in the same semantic field of 'building' (cf. 'Häuserblock') as AE 'block'.44 On the other hand it may be understood as a transfer of the AE near-homophone [bl#k] . Medium-strength interference enters with Barmädchen*5 (&lt;barmaid), a "loanblend".46 The first, free, morpheme is transferred; the second is reproduced with the help of German native material, whose choice was determined by the existence of a cognate of partial homophony and similar meaning (-mädchemmaid). Barmädchen, however, is surely less common than 'Barfräulein' or its more elegant synonym 'Bardame'. Interference of the same degree marks Baseballspiel,47 another loanblend. This "com- pound lexical unit"48 involves the transfer of the first, bimorphemic, element 'baseball' and the reproduction of 'game' by G '-spiel'. Maximal interference is exemplified by the transfer of 'cafeteria' and 'Village', the clipped form of the place-name 'Greenwich Village'. Integration into the German 88 Hans Galinsky, Amerikanisches und Britisches Englisch.

If arranged according to spheres of re- ference, they pertain to eating and drinking places [Cafeteria, Barmädchen), Man- hattan streets and neighborhoods (Biodi, Village), ironically sentimental love (küßt midi zur Guten Nadit), death grotesquely manipulated by funeral directors (Trauer- häusern - funeral homes), nature comfortably manipulated by technology (Luftmasdiine - air conditioner) and life as a whole manipulated by a sense of stoical humor (Grins und ertrag es). With admirable economy borrowings from English, mainly American English, have been made use of to subtly but constantly convey a poet's sense of the Americanness of setting, characters and atmosphere. As this Americanness is not an end in itself but subservient to the symbolic nature of the play as a whole, it can do without the more obvious realism of phonic and syntactic interference. Lexical and phrasal borrowings suffice to achieve the degree of suggestive American 'reality' needed. Syntactic interference would seem to be rarely used by German-speaking authors to provide 'American color'. However, its use can be very effective. Bertolt Brecht, in his poem - 'report' („Bericht") as he calls it - Kohlen für Mike51 knew how to handle it. With, occasionally and inobtrusively, a Biblical, Old Testament tinge („Ein Weib wohnte zu Bidwell") admixed to it, the American color of the poem, in the order of the story it tells, enters via the transfer of proper names: 1 Ich habe gehört, daß in Ohio Zu Beginn dieses Jahrhunderts Ein Weib wohnte zu Bidwell Mary McCoy, Witwe eines Streckenwärters Mit Namen Mike McCoy, in Armut. 2 Aber jede Nacht von den donnernden Zügen der Wheeling Railroad Warfen die Bremser einen Kohlenklumpen Über die Zaunlatten in den Kartoffelgarten Mit rauher Stimme ausrufend in Eile: Für Mike' 49 Ibid., 45. 50 Op.cit., 31, 32, 37. 51 Hundert Gedichte 1918-1950 (Berlin, 1961), 101, 118-119, 287.

All of the proper names, names of places, 'states', companies, and persons, are given prominence by audible means, repetition - Ohio, McCoy, Mike, Mike McCoy, Wheeling Railroad - and / or pre-pause position. The pause or juncture, terminal juncture of the sustained, rising, and falling types,52 occurs at the end of the metrical line arrangement or within it, or at the end of the stanza structure.

The distribution of transferred proper names throughout the poem is patterned, with symmetry (1.1:1.3, 5.2:5.4, 1.5:3.5, 2.5:4.4 ends of stanza) being tempered by variation. The pattern is reinforced by syntactic or syntactic plus semantic paral- lelism: prepositional phrase (in Ohio, zu Bidwell, für Mike, an Mike, Für Mike, Bei der Wheeling Railroad), and 'first plus family name' arrangement (Mary McCoy, Mike McCoy). 52 W. Nelson Francis, The Structure of American English (New York, 1958), 157.</page><page sequence="8">Stylistic Aspects of Linguistic Borrowing 105 Deviation from the German syntax of educated written informal or spoken formal prose is, of course, nothing extraordinary in German poetry. Even where such devia- tions agree with English syntax of corresponding usage levels, they must not be attributed to English syntactic interference, without due precaution being taken. The word-order pattern in „daß in Ohio / Zu Beginn dieses Jahrhunderts / Ein Weib wohnte zu Bidwell" largely agrees with English structure. So does word-order throughout the last stanza. Both 'deviations' can be accounted for by the wish to emphasize the American proper names by pre-pause position as mentioned above. The 'attached participial phrase'53 „Mit rauher Stimme ausrufend in Eile" is also in partial agreement with English syntax, but has a Latin flavor as well. It would seem to be the latter that combines with the Old Testament tinge of the introductory stanza to 'stylize' the language of the poem. Its very last line, however, contains a feature unmistakably English. „Für Kamerad- schaft", in genuine German, would run ,Aus Kameradschaft', or, much less likely, »Wegen ihrer Kameradschaft'. The second, and highly improbable, interpretation would involve not only grammatical usage but also poetical meaning. „Für Kameradschaft", an unquestionable grammatical interference, underscores the 'Americanness' of setting and characters conveyed by lexical, proper name, inter- ference. Along with those names of place, state, company and persons, it is accorded prominence by pre-pause position. As „Für Mike" and „Bei der Wheeling Railroad", it fills the last line of its stanza, but unlike its counterparts in stanzas 2 and 4, it has the last word in the poem as a whole. The circular pattern in works of literature often serves as a structural symbol of sameness, more specifically, the unchange- ability of a social system, or the course of nature. The pattern reasserts itself in Kohlen für Mike. It extends from „Ohio" at the end of the first line to „Ohios" in the last stanza, yet at the end of its next to last, not its very last line. As seen above, this place is held by what in the world view of this poem ranks as the moral counter- force: „Kameradschaft". Although a universal value, its specific geographic area of operation is not lost sight of. Preceded by lexical borrowings, syntactic borrowing works as a final index to the American setting. II. 2 In borrowing, a desire for truth links the stylistic function of suggesting American reality to the function of precision. While the former comes into play only over against things American, the latter is of a considerably wider application, which will include things German. But even then an implicit reference to America as country of origin or point of comparison will be preserved more often than not. It is here that the travel book, i. e. the kind written by Germans about their American travels, makes its timely appearance in this paper. On the one hand, through its Americanisms it will convey American atmosphere, on the other it will 68 Max Deutschbein - Hermann Klitscher, Grammatik der englischen Sprache auf wissen- schaftlicher Grundlage (Heidelberg, 1959; 16th ed.), 148.</page><page sequence="9">106 HansGalinsky serve as a distributor of Americanisms across the German reading public, placing at its disposal a number of borrowings likely to add precision to the recipient language. As touches of dialect provide for regional color, touches of foreign language provide for national color. This truism holds good of literary works of the imagina- tion as well as the prose of travel books. It is in this genre that the stylistic function of suggesting foreign reality is given fullest scope. Borrowings from American Eng- lish in German books of American travel, inasmuch as these borrowings are "outright transfer(s) of the phonemic sequence from one language to another"54, have received the interest of American lexicographers for the light they throw on American English.55 The viewpoint of 'language contact', and the potential stylistic relevance of the borrowings resulting from it have escaped attention. Nor have the whole range of interference, beyond the lexical, and the totality of selective principles involved so far found an observer. Out of a host of German travel books dealing with the United States56 I have chosen two, one, In Amerika ist alles anders, written by Helmut Thielicke, an eminent Hamburg divinity professor,57 the other, Faust ging nach Amerika, by Karl Korn,58 an outstanding Frankfurt newspaper editor. Both travelogs lend themselves to com- parison. Their authors are intellectuals of the middle generation, their visits to the United States were equally brief and made in consecutive years (spring, 1956, and April-May, 1957), and Herr Korn appears even to allude, somewhat ironically, to Herr Thielicke's little book or at least its title.59 Distinguishing the stylistic motivations at work in travel book borrowings from American English is more difficult than it is in those of imaginative literature. The wish to appear well-informed, the inclination toward 'showing off' and impressing the reader, in short "the prestige motive" justly emphasized by Charles Hockett,60 will also motivate interference. To eliminate non-stylistic reasons like these I shall concentrate on two types of lexical and phrasal interference. The first61 represents new attempts at reproduction, i. e. newly coined loan translations, loanblends or loan creations, with new transfers 54 Weinreidi, Languages in Contact, 47. 55 John T.

The second type does take in transfers, yet only such as can be accounted for in terms of precision. Borrowings for precision's sake can be put to the following test ably formulated by Leisi with reference to AE-BE contacts, but applicable to AE-G contacts as well: Such borrowings have to be Lehnwörter, welche als unersetzbar bezeichnet werden können, weil sie neue, bisher . . . nicht vorhandene Begriffe (Denkkategorien) stiften . . . Die neuen Wörter sind also neue Denkkate- gorien, praktische Erkenntnisinstrumente, die zu einer besseren Erhellung und geistigen Beherr- schung der Welt beitragen . . . Die Einmaligkeit der neuen Begriffe bringt es mit sich, daß eine direkte einfache Übersetzung, z. B. ins Deutsche, ausgeschlossen ist.62 In other words, a term taken over for precision's sake helps repattern a German semantic field. Type I of the travel book borrowings from AE can be illustrated by Wolken- kratzersilhouette for Skyline'.63 The German rendering stands midway between a "loan rendition" stimulated by the inline - skyscraper association, and a "loan creation".64 It appears to be either a new coinage of the author's or an adoption of a fairly recent coinage. Soziale Anpassung*5 however, a "loan translation proper" « social adjustment) would seem to reflect a slightly older stage of borrowing, with the travel book benefitting from German translations of AE sociological terminology. Only too often will a German travel book writer trying to combine 'American color' and 'precision' run into a difficulty exemplified by the following attempt at solution: „in den Phi-Beta-Kappa-Kreisen (will sagen in einer gewissen gutsituierten, aber nicht reichen, gebildeten Schicht)".66 The loanblend has been reinforced by paraphrase. Type II of lexical interference in travel books is represented by clever in a sentence like „Amerika ist ... von cleveren Köpfen auf seine top-secrets befragt".67 The wider context of the passage proves that clever, in its reference, is not restricted to Ameri- can interpreters of America, nor is Herr Korn the first to borrow68 and adapt it to the German system of inflectional signals (cf. clevere). As his book testifies to a fine sense of style, he has borrowed clever because it fulfills two stylistic functions at one and the same time: (1) Within the semantic field of 'intelligence' terms it expresses a shade of meaning lacking in all of the other terms such as ,klug' ge- weckt4, ,gescheiť, ,gewandť, »verständig4, »vernünftig4, »intelligent4, ,begabť, »talen- tiert4, »verschmitzt4, »pfiffig4, »gewitzt4, »schlau4, ,hell(e)4, ,durchtrieben4, »ausgekocht4, »abgefeimt4, etc. Recognition of a high degree of intelligence, yet a certain reserve toward this intelligence, characterize the adaptation of clever to a native semantic field.

More strongly than clever ,der JoV retains its reference to an attitude, in this case not toward intelligence but toward paid employment, which Germans suppose to be typically American: „Genau so unsentimental, wie man den Job wechselt, falls man anderswo mehr verdienen kann, läßt man sich in den Betrieb einspannen. "e9 Precision, welcome as it is in travelogs, is even more welcome in, nay, indispensable to, scientific prose. This is borne out by AE borrowings of German sociologists, psychologists, educators et al. Right down to the level of newspaper reports and summaries of scientific developments, AE interference can be found, genuinely or supposedly adding precision to the German vocabulary. 'Late developer' was rendered as Spätentwickler.™ This is a loan translation proper, at the price of syntactic ir- regularity: the implicitness of reflexive meaning has been borrowed as well. In the case of status it is not the word as such but a peculiar AE shade of its meaning that has been adopted by German sociologists and many educated speakers in general. Status, a borrowing from Latin, has had a time-honored tradition in German usage, chiefly in political terminology. The AE-borrowed sociological exten- sion of its meaning is no less aptly illustrated by the following passage than is the German search for a native equivalent of adequate precision: Für das neue Haus war der Konzertflügel zu groß. Er konnte außerdem mit 2900 DM einen willkommenen Zuschuß für die Baukasse einbringen. So entstand der Entschluß, ihn zu ver- kaufen. Die Reaktion der Umwelt auf diesen Besdiluß madite deutlidi, was die Amerikaner mit ihrem vielberedeten Wort "status" meinen. Wir können es mit „Ansehen" oder mit „Geltung" übersetzen und kommen dodi nidit ganz auf das Entsprediende. Eine starke Nuance Prestige schwingt mit.71 Thus status is rightly felt to lend genuine precision to the German semantic field of 'human relations', especially 'social esteem'. Superficial precision is furnished by the transfer of 'teen(-)ager', particularly popular in advertizing lingo. (Der) Teenager would suggest the existence of common "characteristics of persons in their teens".72 Clever and Job, borrowed terms we have already met with in travel books, recur in mass circulation papers and in spoken German, while the verbal derivative jobben seems to be restricted to slang.75 The wide diffusion of the two transfers is partly due to the fact that they help recategorize attitudes toward such generally interesting phenomena as intelligence and labor. It is instructive to learn that exactly the same function of additional precision has been 69 Ibid., 33. Cf. Thielicke, op. cit., 18. Cf.

'work that is found, and for which one has no attachment and no spiritual interest'.74 The fact of connotations having gained precision in written and spoken German could also be illustrated by Manager, managen, Manager-Krankheit. In the context of a public hearing by a Bundestag committee a Defense Ministry official was quoted to the effect: (Schneider bezeichnete Schloß als einen) „selbstbewußt auftretenden Manager . . . Die Visi- tenkarte hinterließ den Eindruck, daß wir es mit einem größeren Manager zu tun hatten".75 German jGeschäftsmann' and Geschäftemacher4 do not imply being wily and high- pressured; ,Manipulierer' lacks the restriction to the commercial and the industrial. Thus, they cannot substitute for Manager.™ Compared to 'manager' in the source language - "1. a person who manages; especially, a person who manages a business, institution, etc. ... 2. a person who manages affairs or expenditures, as of a household, skillfully and carefully"77 - the connotation is pejorative. The pej oration may have been caused or stimulated by an unpleasant shade of meaning inherent in 'manage, v.': "to get (a person) to do what one wishes, especially by skill, tact, flattery, etc.; make docile or submissive to control ... to bring about by contriving; contrive; succeed in accomplishing: often used ironically . . ."78 The case of Party is slightly different. Once again popular with travel book writers, and speakers alike, this lexical transfer has added precision by repatterning a se- mantic field constituted by »Gesellschaft', »Abendgesellschaft', »gesellschaftliche Ver- anstaltung', geselliges Beisammensein', , (kleines) Fest', ,Gäste', ,Festivität' (student slang), etc.79 This time, however, it is rather the thing than the affective attitude toward it, rather the denotation than the connotation that has gained precision. To many Germans of today Party will suggest a social gathering, preferably of young people and of much less formality than the older generation had been accustomed to.80 Compounds such as Teenager- und Keller-Parties are characteristic of this in- cipient "specialization in content". It is debatable whether this stylistic tendency toward precision by "specialization 74 Weinreich, Languages in Contact, 54, commenting on Guiseppe Prezzolini, La lingua della „giobba", Lingua nostra, 1 (1935), 122-123. 75 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, April 7, 1962, p. 3, col. 5. 76 As to its checkered German history - from circus and variety show language (around 1870) to commercial use („»Geschäftsleiter4 . . . seit 1905 belegt") and press jargon (post-1905) cf.

The fact that precision-loving technical terminology is particularly liable to this trend lends probability to my assumption. An example taken from meteorology might suffice: „Die südwärts wandernden nordpazifischen Tiefj verlieren nach Erreichen Kaliforniens immer mehr an Wirksamkeit." Normally, the German plural form would be ,(die) Tiefe4, the pattern ,das Tiefe: die Tiefe* establishing a sufficient semantic and inflectional contrast with ,die Tiefe: die Tiefen*. Probably the partial overlapping, though formal only, has, in the interest of precision, been avoided by the borrowing of the English plural sign У. 'The low: the lows' (= low pressure area(s)),81 with their 'zero : -s' form contrast, could easily have served as a model for ,das Tief : die Tiefs*. Thus "the extension of the use of the indigenous word" ,tief'82 - cf. the meteorological meaning - might have been given additional precision by a mor- phological device. ,Tiefs* probably combines semantic and morphemic interference. Since the facility of forming -s plurals of so called 'adjectives in substantival func- tion' is particularly striking in AE, especially in its technical sub-languages,83 the German phenomenon also occurring in technical meteorological use might be related to this American trend. II. 3 Precision, undeniable in its motivating force on the lexical level, less convincing on the morphemic, finds its stylistic counterpart in intentional disguise. It is not only in literary art (where it appears among the rhetorical figures) that intentional disguise makes its entry in the well-known shape of euphemism.84 On other levels, such as written and spoken informal, disguise by euphemism takes various forms. Obviously, its two special domains are: argots meant for communication between initiates; and commercial lingo. The use to which AE borrowings are put can be seen from the following letter addressed to the editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung by Frau Lüders, former president (by seniority) of the Bundestag:85 Trotz des strikten Verbots, Bordelle und bordellähnliche Betriebe zu unterhalten, fahren immer mehr Gemeinden fort, nicht nur beide Augen gegenüber der Einrichtung immer neuer Unternehmen - jetzt unter der unverdächtigen Bezeichnung „Appartementhaus"' - zuzudrücken ... sie nehmen ja nicht einmal die sogenannten „Callgirl-Betriebe" unter die strafrechtliche Kuppelei-Lupe.

The former testifies to the overlapping of two phases of interference. The older phase manifests itself in „Appartement" (&lt;Fr. appartement), which together with , Parterre4, ,Etage' ,Mansarde' Souterrain' and 'Garage' forms the hard core of Gallicisms in the modern Ger- man reference sphere of 'housing'. The younger phase shows (1) in the German reproduction of the morphological pattern 'substantival determinant + substantival determinatum' underlying AE, not French, 'apartment house', (2) in the German use of the cognate ,Haus'. The latter item, Callgirl-Betriebe, illustrates how much inte- gration into the German vocabulary is facilitated by the above-mentioned mor- phological pattern common to both, the source and the recipient language. Moreover, the passage quoted from Frau Lüders' outspoken letter throws light on a stylistic tendency opposing lexical borrowing motivated by intentional disguise. Characteristically this counter-tendency aims at precision. The fact that in this and related areas of 'entertainment' precision of terminology is wanted least, can be proved by yet another pertinent example: Strip-tease. A transfer from AE, it has practically replaced Entkleidungsnummer' or ,Nackttanz'. Precise enough in the source language, strip-tease, when taken over into German, functions as a term of disguise with monolinguals. Hardly less commercial than German entertainment business lingo, department store advertising jargon has at many places come to use Basement instead of Kellergeschoß' or French-borrowed 'Souterrain'. It is not by mere chance that in this section (II. 3), unlike II. 1 and II. 2, most of the examples quoted are "outright transfers", 86 only one - Appartementhaus - is a loanblend but none proves to be a loan translation. Intentional disguise is not served by complete "reproduction in terms of equivalent native words."87 II. 4 Brevity has long been held a stylistic ideal the world over,88 however different conditions may have been for its operation in epigram, proverb, lyrical "tanka" or "haiku", dramatic "stichomythia", short story or terse modern newspaper prose, let alone newspaper headlines. Partly owing to its many syllabic inflections and to the ease with which it can form multimorphemic compounds, German is particularly aware of the possibility for style-oriented choice put at its disposal by the transfer of monosyllabic and disyllabic AE and BE words. A study of items within their pertinent semantic field and their context of utterance is rewarding. An investigation of the latter will corroborate the correctness of Riffaterre's concept of style as "a 88 Weinreich, Languages in Contact, 47. 87 Ibid., 50. The same might be said of Sex (cf. for one of its ever so many appearances Frank- furter Allgemeine Zeitung, October 17, 1961), which differs from Sexus, a borrowing from Latin and nowadays largely an instance of 'learned' disguise. 88 Heinrich Lausberg, Handbuch der literarischen Rhetorik, Registerband (München, 1960], 655-656.</page><page sequence="15">112 HansGalinsky string of binary oppositions whose poles" are "context and stylistic devices".89 Illu- minating in this respect is the following passage taken from Karl Korn's Faust ging nach Amerika: Seit dem größten Ereignis der jüngsten amerikanischen Geschichte, der Depression zu An- fang der dreißiger Jahre, datieren Ideologen und Kulturkritiker, die drüben mehr Ansehen und Einfluß haben, als sie selbst zugeben und wir wissen, einen neuen Trend.90 As to its semantic field, Trend is shorter than ,Richtung', /Tendenz', , Strömung*. ,Kurs' a much older loan (&lt;lat. cursus), is admittedly (slightly) shorter still, but pre- sents no real rival, as in many situations it is felt to be unsuitably metaphorical. As regards its context, Trend, in the passage quoted, is the only monosyllabic substantive. On the strength of the above quoted synonyms for Trend, motivation by 'precision' can be discounted, while 'suggesting American color' might rank as a merely secondary reason for borrowing. By 1957, the year of publication of Herr Korn's travel book, Trend had already secured for itself a firm place in written and spoken German, above all, it would seem, in the writings and speeches of German economists.91 In them the reference was mainly to German, not American developments. Not a monosyllabic simple word, but a trisyllabic compound, 'sex-appeal' illustrates the uses of brevity. Its German equivalents are polysyllabic phrasal monsters like geschlechtliche Anziehung', or, longer still, geschlechtliche Anziehungskraft', with »An- ziehungskraft für das andere Geschlecht'92 as long-distance champion. Therefore the transfer (der) sex-appeal has since 192793 been scoring easy successes. Even a theo- logian, with a delightful sense of humor, like Thielicke was quick to see the uses of this transfer: Audi die schönsten Beine und die schwenkbarste Anatomie zeichnen nicht den Besitzer, son- dern die Gesamtheit aus, der das alles gehört und der gegenüber selbst der sex-appeal eine dienende - und im übrigen wohlhonorierte - Funktion ausübt.94 Nor have intra-German political boundaries set up obstacles to the operation of brevity as a stylistic value of borrowings. (Die) Intershop GmbH and Intershop- Läden furnish pertinent proof.95 Inter- would seem to be a back-clipping of 'inter- national,' the first constituent of the phrase 'international shop(s);' at the same time it appears to intentionally evoke associations with a morphological type of mid- nineteenth century U. S. origin (cf. inter-state relations).96 Needless to say, 'intershop' 89 Stylistic Context, Word, 16 (I960), 207. 90 Op. cit., 22. 91 Cf.

Thus the stylistic uses of brevity are apparent not only in "outright transfers" such as Trend or sex-appeal, but also in a loan creation97 like Intershop (-Läden) benefiting from two brevity devices, (1) the generally English morphological process of back-clipping, and perhaps (2) the originally AE morphological pattern 'phrase inter- + substantive' -f 'substantive' (inter-state relations).

Yet the same persons who will have no objections to using testen in such a sentence as ,Gestern bin ich getestet worden4 will stick to such a fixed term as ,Fahrprüfung*. 'Driving tesť, its English equivalent, has not stimulated ""Fahrtest. Thus brevity does not have it all its own way. However, there is yet further proof of its efficacy, and what makes it even more striking, it is proof of the morphological, not the lexical kind. In professional speech and its radiations into general speech, brevity has come to assert itself in the growing diffusion of several word-forming devices. Four of them concern suffixation, one each relates to blending and clipping, two come under the head of compounding, one item, the rarest of all, reverses the process of 'word-formation by prefixation' in reverting to the simple at the expense of the composite. As regards suffixation, the most conspicuous, though not most frequent, 'Ameri- canized' features of present-day German morphology are transfers of such 'new' AE suffixes132 as '-tron', '-rama', and '-matic'. Europačrorc « Europa + (cycloj-tron),133 Afrikarama « Afrika + (pano)-rama), »Afrika-Ausstellung',134 Eternamatic135 (( etern/a + (auto) -matic), designating a watch, still retain the flavor of the laboratory or of the desk of the sales-promoter. Examples of "word-manufacturing",136 they have not yet invaded the general vocabulary. It is not only the scientist or the businessman, but occasionally also the poet that knows how to put AE suffixation to good use. The following example is once again taken from Brecht; the lines were composed in 1947, probably after his return, in October of that year, to Europe, to France and Switzerland, if not to Germany.137 Und der schwarze Marketier Sagt, befraget: Ich marschier Auf Gedeih (und auf Verderb) Für den Freien Wettbewerb.138 The phrasal loanblend der schwarze Marketier « the black marketeer) is preferred to the normal native compound ,der Schwarzmarkthändler', a term which lacks brevity in the expression of the agent. Integration into the German context of the poem was facilitated by the existence, in German, of many French-borrowed words, particularly in the military field, e. g. »Musketier*, »Grenadier', ,PiomVr'. For the German reader the rhyming word »marschier' underlines the military connotations of the suffix -ier. The old French model is still apparent in Brecht's -ier spelling of the English -eer suffix, which, on its part, stems from the same French source as G -ier does. Thus Marketier differs from the ,-tron', ,-rama', and ,-matic' coinages by representing a traditional, not a recent and unmistakably AE, suffix. 132 Cf.

As a stylistic use in its own right it will be discussed later. Suf- fice it to say at this point that the suffix-caused American ring of der schwarze Marke- tier is played against the economic phrase „Für den Freien Wettbewerb". The allusion to 'free competition' as a principal part of the American system of economy is un- mistakable. Der schwarze Marketier serves as a parody on the system. American morphological interference adopted 'for brevity's sake' has so far consisted of obvious productive AE suffixes, either 'old' or 'recent'. In a German composite like Berlinale, however, American influence is less obvious. Berlinale 1954, as the brief version of , Vierte Internationale Filmfestspiele 1954' ran,139 is intentionally suggestive of the Venice ,Biennale'. Admittedly, the source of -ale or -naie as element of Ber- linale is Italian, but its morphological functioning is not. -ale or -naie functions exactly the same, American-borrowed, way as -tron in Europatron, -rama in Afrikarama, -matic in Eternamatic. Still less obvious is American interference in a fairly large and fast increasing group of German -er derivatives. At first sight one might not suspect any trace of trans- atlantic influence in such German coinages as Klimaregler, Lautsprecher, Fernschreiber, Elektronenrechner, Plattenspieler, or Verstärker. The morphological pattern on which these 'inanimate agent' nouns designating "a device, tool, implement, machine or the like"140 have been formed is by no means alien to German. Aside from the -er suffix, German has made ample use of '-maschine' functioning as determinatum in compounds like »Schreibmaschine', ,Waschmaschine', whose English counterparts are either ex- clusively ,-er' derivations (typewriter) or ,-machine' compounds side by side with ,-er* suffixations ('washing machine: 'washer'). One would like to ask, though, why so many fairly recent German names for technical products and devices should have not only exact lexical but also morphological equivalents in AE (and often BE as well). Such pairs as I. Lautsprecher Loudspeaker Plattenspieler Record player Verstärker Amplifier Fernschreiber Teletyper are remarkable, the more so if contrasted with older words like II. Sdireihmaschine Typewriter Over against these examples of fixed use, German evidence of competitive patterns is available: III.

(der) Tuner143 Tuner (der) Converter144 Converter It may be safe to draw two conclusions, (1) the short cognate, agent-indicating suffix -er has widely, though not completely, replaced polysyllabic ^maschine' for determinatum in compounds; (2) the "increase" of its use "during the last four decades, especially after 1945, may have been promoted by the same, though considerably stronger tendency in English, particularly American English."145 Brevity-oriented stylistic choice between native and foreign morphological patterns has resulted also in a higher frequency of b 1 e n d s and clippings. The former have the playful banter of the variety show, sophisticated newspaper or periodical prose, and humorous or would-be humorous advertizing lingo for their special domain.

S. occupation regime,150 furnish pertinent examples. As in the case of the increasing use of the -er suffix, it would be safe to say that a native German trend has been accelerated by recent post- 1945 familiarity with AE morphological processes. The 'portmanteau word', a well-known term for blends in BE, has apparently not sufficed to exert a similar intensifying influence on pre-1939 German. The instances of blending mentioned above demonstrate its applicability to German or (cf. Grusical) to German plus AE-borrowed lexical materials.

This glaring piece of banality may illustrate the extent to which the stylistic uses of brevity, in the shape of blends, can be degraded in the hands of would-be witty ad- vertizing lingo manufacturers. The cheaply allusive context which the above-mentioned blend has been fitted into is telling enough: Oder geben Sie nadi jedem „Party-Kuß" gleich „SOS"? Nun ja, das ist Geschmackssache. Suchen Sie sich aus den 77 Cocktail-Rezepten in der neuen Brigitte - „Party-Kuß" und „SOS" gehören dazu - diejenigen aus, die Ihnen am besten bekommen, und mixen Sie sich recht viele vergnügliche Stunden.152 So says „Brigitte, Die moderne Frauenzeitschrift". Once again not the morphological pattern as such but only its more frequent em- ployment would suggest AE interference in the case of clipping. Its pre-1945 fre- quency in Germany had been incomparably higher than that of blending. Science, politics, administration, the military forces had made ample use of this brevity-produc- ing device. To what extent the Soviet model and that of 'New Deal' America cooking its 'alphabet soup' may have stimulated the clipping boom of the 1920's, 30's, and early 40's, is still an open question. The trend as such has by now become more inter- national than ever, and is part and parcel of our utilitarian, brevity-minded Age of Technology. Although this international dimension of the 'clipping' vogue or, rather, craze renders it difficult to assign individual German clippings to a primary, non-German source, there does exist in Germany a particular type of clipping which positively sug- gests AE origin. The type is best illustrated by Georg.159 It looks like the usual German first name, yet in reality, commercial reality for that matter, its first syllable Ge stands for 'Gcmeinschafts-', the following о does work for 'Organization', while r and g re- present ^uhrkohle' and ,G. m. b. H.' (= limited company or Ltd.). A phrase and an apposition have been shortened to one syllable and three initial letters. Their com- bination is pronounced not according to the 'alphabetical' value of its constituents ['ge: 'o: 'er 'ge:], and with level stress, but according to the written shape of this acronym ,Georg' ['ge:ork]. The analogy of AE 'Care',154 to use but the best-known specimen of this kind of acronym for illustration, is unmistakeable. The recent boom in Eur{o)~ composites has, amongst others, produced Euratom (&lt; Europa or European? + atom), Eurotel (&lt; Europa or -ean? + hotel), and Eurovision155 (&lt; Europa or -ean? + television). The gain in point of brevity ranges, on the printed page, from three to eight letters for maximum. The individual lexical items may be German-coined or borrowed from other European languages, yet the general morpho- logical trend has, to say the least, been intensified by English, especially AE, inter- ference.156 152 Mainzer Allgemeine Zeitung, Sept. 19, 1961. 153 FAZ, May 5, 1954. 154 Care = Cooperative for American Remittances to £urope. 155 FAZ, June 3, 1954, {Eurovision), Nov. 11, 1961, {Eurotel). 158 Cf.

Good old ,Lilo* (Li(e)seZotte) of the early decades of the 20th century has lately been follow- ed by ,Romy* (Rosemarie Schneider of movie glamor) and ,Halo* (Hannelore Franke of skiing fame).157 American interference, of the intensifying, not the causal kind, cannot be completely excluded. As little as in the case of blending has the increased practise of clipping led to the adoption of individual, specifically AE, clippings, that is to say, more specific than NATO, SEATO and a host of similar international terms of military or political re- ference. Radar and О. Я.,158 with K. O. as early forerunner, are among the rare ex- amples of outright transfers in general circulation. O. K. surely owes its worldwide, and with it, its German diffusion to its brevity. This point is unintentionally borne out by the following British, not American-sponsored, advertisement in a German newspaper: In der Dunkelkammer eines englischen Werkes in den Midlands wird soeben das elftausend- ste Röntgen-Negativ gewissenhaft kontrolliert. Ein Kopfnicken - dann schreibt eine Hand ein knappes „O.K." auf das Negativ.159 However, there may be yet another stylistic reason for the German vogue of O. K. than love of terseness. This topic should be reserved for later discussion (cf. p. 134). The two most recent newcomers to the fraternity of brevity-oriented stylistic de- vices furnished by morphological borrowing relate to compounding. The first has turned up in the shape of Korea-Krieg,™0 Koreaboom™1 Italien-Reise, Adenauer-Reise, Berlin-Krise, Berlin-Note, Berlin-Pläne. They originated in newspaper language; rein- forced by radio and TV newscaster speech, they have forced their way into general spoken German, both formal and informal.162 Formerly ,Koreanischer Krieg4 (cf. ,der Böhmisch-Pfälzische Krieg*), Jtalienische Reise*,163 »Adenauers Reise*, »Berliner Krise* would have been their equivalents. The phrase structure, with the determinant being either an adjective or the genitive of a substantive, has been replaced by a compound of the 'substantive (stem) + substantive' pattern. The co-existence of the older and the newer type is as usual leading to semantic differentiation: »Berliner Krise* meaning e. g. Regierungskrise in Berlin*, ,Berlin-Krise* equaling ,Krise wegen Berlin*.164 Sim- ilarly, the phrase »Berliner Pläne* may be interpreted as ,Pläne der Berliner*165 or »Pläne von Berlinern*, while the compound ,Berlin-Pläne* has come to represent »Pläne, die Berlin betreffen*. Thus, the first element of the compound Berlin-Krise is felt to be the object, not the subject within the syntagma. Even in Adenauer-Reise, 157 Neue Zeitung, Jan. 19, 1953, („Halo" Franke). 158 Cf. variant spelling okay in FAZ, Feb. 22, 1962. 159 FAZ, Nov. 24, 1961: „Flämisch - wie man es in Wolverhampton spricht" (ad sponsored by ICI). 160 FAZ, Dec. 30, 1961.

Die Hannover-Messe 1962 illustrates the same change.166 The singularly favorable conditions of this change may have been (1) the not exactly euphonious phonemic se- quence ,Hannover(i)sche* (allomorph: ,Hannöver(i)sche') as form of the adjective, (2) the derivative Hannoveraner* suggesting rather the substantive than the adjective. How far awareness of a newly acquired morphological device of semantic differen- tiation has been going, may be exemplified by an extreme (and extremely comical) case: Es heißt . . . „meine Italien-Reise", so wie auch Frankreich-Reise, England-Reise, Amerika- Reise gesagt wird. Ja, „amerikanische Reise" zum Beispiel könnte sogar als Reise im amerika- nischen Stil, als Hopp- und Galopp-Tourismus mißverstanden werden.167 The two aspects of the phenomenon, the replacement of the phrase by the compound, and the coexistence of both types, facilitating differentiation of meaning, are most probably due to interference of AE, especially newspaper and newscast style. For a considerable time AE impact on BE has been working in the same direction. A German newspaper columnist diagnosed the situation correctly and observed the coalescence of 'brevity' with 'precision': Aus dem Zwang zur Kürze in den Überschriften, aus dem Bestreben, ein Ereignis möglichst schlagkräftig auszudrücken, sind von den Zeitungen Zusammensetzungen erfunden und in Um- lauf gesetzt worden, darunter so schreckliche wie Tunesien-Vermittlung . . . Wenn einmal der Anfang gemacht ist, dann waltet oder wütet bald die Analogiebildung nach bekannten Mustern . . . Manche Zusammenrückungen drücken sogar eine Bedeutungsnuance, aus, die sich anders nur umständlich wiedergeben läßt.168 Brevity as stylistic response to the financial challenge of space-economy has rendered productive yet another German type of compound, the 'additive' one.169 Steno-Sekretä- rin (&lt;Stenotypistin + Sekretärin) is but secondarily a clipping. Primarily the underlying pattern, with the order of the constituents reversed, corresponds to AE/BE 'secretary- stenographer'.170 As ,Gottmensch', originally borrowed from Medieval Latin,171 proves, the pattern has not been alien to German for several centuries. Yet its recent pro- ductivity seems to be due rather to such AE/BE cognates as 'secretary-stenographer' and its analogs like 'secretary-treasurer'. Most probably all of these brevity-increasing devices of morphology, ranging as they do from suffixation and blending to clipping and compounding, have already been noticed by one or another scholar. The following feature, however, has apparently escaped attention: „1381 Serienschiffe mit zusammen 10,62 Millionen BRT queren ge- genwärtig noch die Weltmeere."172 Here English 'cross, v.', a 'simple' word, has inter- 166 FAZ, May 5, 1962, quoting title of a radio lecture.

To the present writer's best knowledge, the latter represents an in- dividual coinage, not accepted by general usage. Brevity, considered as a stylistic aspect of borrowing, has revealed itself as a many- faceted phenomenon. The newspaper essayist who, in early 1962, on the occasion of Jazz* and a Jazz-Gottesdiensť, mused on „Neon-Leuchtkraft des Kurzwortes und seine saugende Anziehungskraft"173 has been proved to be right to an extent even he may not have guessed. Yet in matters of morphological borrowing for brevity's sake, success, contrary to the proverb, has not always bred success but, at places, a measure of resistance. It has taken the form of quoting native American voices raised in protest of certain morpho- logical tools securing brevity. Under the column heading „Tee psycht Sie auf", a na- tional paper of the rank of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung quoted from a News- week commentary Madison Avenue products such as : ... ein Wagen zeichnet sich durch ,Fahrkeit&lt; frideability') aus, eine Zigarette »sanfteť den Rauch ('gentles the smoke'), Tee ,psycht Sie auf ('psyches you up') . . ,174 Resistance of morphological interference - of its direct forms of reproduction and transfer, its indirect form of intensified use of cognate morphological patterns - may have succeeded in stopping or diminishing the use of the more glaring instances of brevity-induced borrowing. It has not been able to slow down, let alone, arrest a sty- listic trend inherent in this Age of Technology. II. 5 The metaphorical nature of many AE words furnishes yet another appeal in American English-German language contact. Literal transfers are rare, while trans- lations abound, so that foreign origin is often not suspected. Therefore, in this paper metaphorical items of lexical interference have been reserved as subtler illustrations of how stylistic factors enter into borrowing. Among the travel writers on the lookout for vivid and memorable turns of speech it is Korn who loves ,hinausgefeuerť (&lt; hinausgeworfen + fired),175 whereas Thielicke is attracted to Sex-Bombe,™ a loanblend using G ,Bombe' But it is the German jour- nalist, who as foreign correspondent-translator introduces, and as lead writer or radio and TV commentator both introduces and diffuses most metaphorical borrowings. Gehirnwäsche (&lt; brainwashing), Gipfelkonferenz (&lt; summit conference) are but a few recent examples. In general speech this type is best represented by the old loan rendi- tion Wolkenkratzer (&lt; skyscraper) and the younger loanblend Gangstermethoden. Not until 1961-1962 was 'package' used figuratively, and quickly adopted for service in compounds like Fragenpaket and Sozialpaket, .177 German diplomatic and political circles would seem to be the chief deliverers of such 'packages'. 178 FAZ, Jan. 9, 1962. 174 Loc. cit., Feb. 11, 1961. 175 Faust ging nach Amerika, 75. 178 In Amerika ist alles anders, 49: „Reize der Sex-Bomben" . 177 FAZ, Oct. 22, 1962.

World Book Encyclopedia Dictionary (Chicago, 1963), 1389.</page><page sequence="25">122 Hans Galinsky The specialized vocabulary of the transportation and traffic expert has borrowed 'beeline' and turned it into the loan rendition Vogelfluglinie, making use, as the 'package' handlers had done, of the cognate (line : Linie; cf. package : Paket). In commercial German the borrowing of 'brand' as metaphorical intensifier is of particular interest. Brandbillig,178 instead of normal »spottbillig4, is perhaps modeled on 'brand-new', the cognate 'brand' facilitating the adoption. The wholesale transfer Paperback,179 with its faintly anthropomorphic second constituent, has not yet evoked an attempt at loan translation proper, or loan rendition. German ,Taschenbuch' is less precise and lacks the metaphorical tinge. Equally a transfer, though of much older, pre- 1871, provenience, (der) Cocktail would not seem to have been generally felt to be a specimen of fanciful expressiveness.180 As to word class, all of these borrowings, hinausgefeuert excepted, are substantives. Verbs are pretty rare indeed. Additional examples include one item from AE/BE naval terminology, the semantic extension einmotten181 (&lt; mothball, v.), and another specimen, this time from slangy and casual or informal AE, verkaufen, in a context like the following: „Ich habe nichts gegen Rhetorik, denn in irgendeiner Form muß man seine Gedanken verkaufen."182 The context strongly suggests AE 'to sell an idea' as model. The passage quoted above is an alleged verbatim report of part of the reply given by a professorial speaker to a discussant at a national convention of the German History Professors Association. Thus an American figurative use of a thoroughly 'com- mercial' verb has found its way into academic discussion, lending it an intentional jocular touch. There may be many other cases in which German slang, and as such the domain of metaphor, has adopted AE slang words and phrases, Etymological research in this area of modern German is not yet advanced enough to permit any cogent conclusions. II. 6 The playful and comic touches inherent in metaphor can become a dominant stylis- tic reason for borrowing. They are meant to convey tone.183 Modern poetic radio 178 Schwäbisches Tagblatt, Jan. 31, 1960 (1?).

A playful word formation composed of English free morphemes, but not existing as a compound in AE, crops up in Miss Bachmann's New York play, Der gute Gott von Manhattan: Frankie: Gib die Kartei her! Wer schmort jetzt oben? Billy: Wie hoch? Im 57. Stock? Das wäre der letzte. Frankie: Gib her! Herr Missismister. Wir probieren es. Billy: Wie? Frankie: Er muß heraus.184 Missismister is "a native German creation as no model exists in the other [i. e. English] language".185 Karl Korn, in the wider frame of an allusively comical Louisiana Legende, and in the narrower context of „Als das Wort Texas fiel, ging mir ein Licht auf", coins Super- mobil186 to designate an automobile whose size adequately reflected that of Texas. Helmut Thielicke, in the context of a hoax inflicted on two elderly American ladies, one of them a nurse, presents the fanciful creation Baby-Lavator.197 His exclamation, »Dick, I have dislearnt all my English«,188 exemplifies how the playful and the realis- tic combine. The reality of a language contact situation, in which a German coins dislearn on the familiar German pattern of ,achten - verachten4 and its equivalent 'respect - d i s respect', is made subservient to the function of conveying tone. The playful note is sustained by the place of these neologisms in a kind of linguistic no man's land between (American) English and German. All of them consist of English morphemes, free or bound, but their combination is un-English. It is effected by Ger- man, but neither language community is making use of these "nonce-words".189 Hence, part of the comical tone springs from the linguistic status of such coinages, and from the reversal of the customary process of word-coining. It is not the native speaker but the foreigner who, imaginatively, 'enriches' the native's tongue by a word actually or potentially understandable to the native! In other words, these neologisms are in- novations not only in the recipient, but also in the source language. The four 'neologisms' quoted are individual coinages and, as to their diffusion, limited to the idiolects of those who coined them. But a fifth example, coca colony sible to paraphrase prose, used as an instrument of purely rational communication. It makes little difference, he thinks, whether we say we ought to pay our debts or that we are under an obligation to restore what we have borrowed.

They seem to poke fun at certain drinking preferences of Americans and/or their German imitators. They might also satirize the still 'colonial' status of Americans over against Europe, 'arbiter of taste', or the political dependence of Western Germany on America. Thus tone was purely playful in Missismister, humorous (and suggestive of reality) in dislearnt. With Baby-Lavator, to which might be added Supermobil, there enters a note of criticism. Both creations satirize American technology as an activity going to extremes: of size, as in Supermobil, of mechanization, as in Baby-Lavator. With coca colony and coca colonials the target of satire would seem to widen so as to in- clude America and 'Americanized' Germany as well. The motive of criticizing by comedy merges with the purpose of suggesting 'Amer- icanness' in the well-known artistic technique of letting the foreigner take over the na- tive's perspective and speech habits.191 Style-conscious travel writers like Korn and Thielicke excel at this kind of thing. Korn's technique of invited interference is subdued, as the following passages reveal: Die Amerikaner, die an der Reeling standen, waren still und andächtig: Old Europe, das Ziel ihrer Pilgerschaft, war erreicht. Ich war zu Hause.192 Wer die mittelständlerischen Leute gesehen hat, die im Mai auf den britischen Massenschiffen voller Bereitschaft und gutem(!) Willen nach Italy kommen . . .19S Empathy or the foreign observer's temporary identification with the native's viewpoint and terminology becomes more obvious in a third example: . . . eines Stücks, das unsere Tochter der Revolution für ausstellungswürdig befunden hatte, weil ihr durch viel Education (so würde sie selber gesagt haben!) gebildeter historischer Sinn wohl von den Antiquitätenhändlern des French Quarter in New Orleans reguliert wurde . . .194 Korn, when borrowing English terms or phrases, partly for comical tone, remains the detached observer. Thielicke is much more outgoing, preferring as he does the role of the friendly talker. Unwillkürlich sage ich zu dem jungen Mann: »Du scheinst ja phantastische boys and girls in deiner Klasse gehabt zu haben! . . . Man darf es also nicht so schrecklich ernst nehmen, . . . wenn Ihr Euch auf die Schulter schlagt {»Hallo, Jackl«) und wenn Ihr alles, was der andere sagt und tut (sogar meine unmögliche Aussprache) ,wonderfuť findet?«195 The friendly talker turns sociological diagnostician, laughing up his sleeve all the while: Jeder Amerikaner - so sagte ich ihnen - habe einen Master, das sei seine Frau; jede Frau 190 Little Texas, the name given to an American Housing Area in Mainz (and others else- where?), might be added as another German 'American neologism' for the sake of con- veying 'tone'. 191 As for comparison of artistic technique cf. К. Lück, Das französische Fremdwort bei Oscar Wilde als stilistisches Kunstmittel. (Diss. Greifswald, 1927). 192 Faust ging nach Amerika, 16. 198 Ibid., 34. 194 Ibid., 78. 195 In Amerika ist alles anders, 14.</page><page sequence="28">Stylistic Aspects of Linguistic Borrowing 125 habe einen Master, das sei das Kind, und jedes Kind habe einen Master, das sei der Hund. Auf jeden Fall stünde der husband auf der untersten Stufe dieser Hierarchie.196 Comical adjustment of the German speaker to his American partner might take a mil- der form, the use of a word originally English but already widely accepted into German colloquial speech, and morphologically integrated into it: »Mir tut es leid, daß Sie diese kleinen unschuldigen Hühnchen gekillt haben . . ,«197 This temporary adoption of, or adjustment to, an American's perspective reproduces either overheard (actually or fictitiously overheard) speech, as with Korn and Thielicke (first example), or it reports self-uttered (actually or fictitiously uttered) speech, as with Thielicke (second and third examples). Tone-oriented borrowing, imitating American speech habits, is common to the travel writer and the sophisticated newspaper columnist. As to the kind of tone, the following example is closer to sharp-tongued Korn than genial Thielicke: Als es (das Gesicht John Glenns) dann die Wirklichkeit erlebte, ... da war keine Phantasie mehr notwendig. Die Kondition war exzellent. Alles war okay. Beinahe normal.198 The dramatic possibilities of this particular stylistic use of AE are exploited in Miss Bachmann's radio play. Once again the mood conveyed has changed from good-natured fun poked at Americans to quite a perceptible degree of mockery: Jennifer: Errette mich! Jan: Ist das aus dir geworden? Bist du's geworden? Aus einem rosaroten Mädchen mit Tagebüchern, Gutenachtküssen und Autoküssen, mit Truman und vollgekritzelten Heften unter dem Arm, sehr nett und wie gefällt Ihnen?199 In keeping with the play's already-mentioned style, which prefers reproduction to transfer, the foreign imitation of the native speaker's lingual group habits takes the form of loan translation. Utterances selected from the source language comprise sup- posed stock responses (sehr nett &lt; very nice) of young American women, especially college students, and stock questions of supposedly all-American diffusion (wie gefällt Ihnen? &lt; how do you like?) The latter of the two stock devices has apparently imposed itself firmly on the foreign mind, so that a German poet-traveler, Rudolf Hagelstange, has called his travel book How do you like America?200 In our next specimen the tone of mockery persists, whereas its target changes from American social life and its conversational clichés to German economic life and the stock figure of the grandiloquent would-be climber among lower middle-class em- ployees. The literary frame is a well-known one in the field of satire: the fictitious let- ter of self-recommendatory application for a post. It appeared in the columns of a local paper of Darmstadt, a minor center for literature and the arts.

As in the previous example, the comic tone partly derives from a purely linguistic source, the incongruous mutual adjustment of AE teenager and G Jäger*. The ad- justment is forced by the exigencies of rhyme. Teenager adjusts, sacrificing its native stress pattern, which, as a rule, is maintained in German literal transfer. Moreover, it dispenses with its native pronunciation of the second syllable and the initial sound of the third for the benefit of a German spelling pronunciation: ['a:ga] instead of [,e!d3j]. On the other hand, G Jäger4 undergoes adjustment, the vowel of the stressed syllable bowing to the preceding spelling pronunciation of Teenager. Hence, the comedy lies in the interpénétration of these two words on both phonemic levels, the suprasegmental and the segmental. Borrowing to convey mockery can be best observed in political poetry. Thanks to the long time span covered by the evolution of Bertolt Brechťs political verse, it would be possible to select three poems from the years 1921, 1930 and 1947 respectively and to study change and continuity in Brechťs tone-oriented uses of English, especially AE, interference. For exigencies of space the comparison will be confined to two poems only.202 1921: Vom armen В. В. 5 Gegen Abend versammle ich um mich Männer Wir reden uns da mit "Gentlemen" an. Sie haben ihre Füße auf meinen Tischen Und sagen: Es wird besser mit uns. Und ich frage nicht: Wann? 7 Wir sind gesessen, ein leichtes Geschlechte In Häusern, die für unzerstörbare galten (So haben wir gebaut die langen Gehäuse des Eilands Manhattan und die dünnen Antennen, die das Atlantische Meer unterhalten. 8 Von diesen Städten wird bleiben: der durch sie hindurchging, der Wind! 9 Bei den Erdbeben, die kommen werden, werde ich hoffentlich Meine Virginia nicht ausgehen lassen durch Bitterkeit 202 The omitted specimen, the "ballad", Der anachronistische Zug oder Freiheit und Demo- cracy (1947), off ers the farcical variation upon our theme of 'tone/ Written probably after Brechťs return from his American exile, it furnishes an extreme example of semantic ex- tension, diachronically of a cognate, synchronically of a homophone: 'saxbank «bank of the Isar), ,Isar-Ufer' Cf.

Thus, the elegiac note tempers the mocking one. The mockery inasmuch as it makes use of English is not yet at the expense of Amer- icans, but of Brecht himself, as well as the present and the future generation of man- kind. America functions but as an imitated prototype of modern urban civilization, and as an ambivalent phenomenon, home of both the transitory skyscraper and of tobacco, soothing even in the 'earthquakes to come'. Two linguistic borrowings, the familiar place and trade names Manhattan and Virginia (cigars), serve to provide American coloring. To them may be added the preference for „des Eilands" over against „der Insel", 'Manhattan Island' function- ing as the model for des Eilands Manhattan. Thus, AE interference directs the choice of words from comparable semantic fields in favor of the German cognate. Mockery, in a mild form, arises from the contrast of two speech levels, the low informal or even the vulgar, and the elevated, an intentional disharmony permeating the poem as a whole. In the lines quoted above this contrast is sometimes intensified by the employment of words and phrases from two languages. The German in the context of the Gentlemen line is low informal; Gentlemen, for the German reader of the poem, has a definitely formal ring. The comic discord of the speech levels, the queer incongruity of the formal word and the informal behavior of the persons de- signated by this word, finally the contrast between what these persons are, i. e. Ger- mans, and what they call themselves, i. e. "Gentlemen", reinforce each other. 1930: Verschollener Ruhm der Riesenstadt New York 2 Welch ein episch gefeiertes Becken war doch dieses Amerika damals!204 Goďs own country!

VIII</page><page sequence="33">130 Hans Galinsky Compared to the "ballad" of 1921, the "report" or "chronicle" of 1930 differs not in point of kind, but only of degree. Mockery has grown into sneer, AE borrowings, subservient to this scathing tone, have increased in number, size and structural rele- vance. In keeping with the contrast pattern running through the whole poem - the boom America of the 1920's vs. the America of the 'Great Depression' - AE inter- ference is geared at first to conveying an optimistic surface picture. Critical undertones employ the same linguistic technique as Korn's travelog did. They mimic the Amer- ican's viewpoint and speechways. In stanza 2 two well-known designations Americans have found for their country, a most grandiloquent one, God's own country, and a most businesslike clipping, the acronym USA, are not merely mentioned, but the one, a transfer of phrase length, functions as an exclamatory sentence, and the emotional tinge of the exclamation is probably implicit irony. The other term, USA, acquires similar, but warmer emotional color from two degrees of personification. Personifica- tion of the first degree turns USA into a human being whose three Christian names are affectionately reduced to an initial letter clipping ['u:,es'a:] or to an acronym ['u:za(:)]; personification of the second degree individualizes this human being, sug- gesting, by way of a simile, the intimacy of relations with one's friend of younger days. It is on this second level that America, with a nostalgic ambivalence, is made to func- tion as the 'land of heart's desire' and, at the same time, the land of young illusionists, perhaps including Brecht himself. Goďs own country and USA are given prominence by being assigned to form self- contained lines in equal distribution across the five-line structure of the second stanza. The symmetrical pattern resulting provides for no AE transfers in lines 1, 3 and 5, whereas transfers fill lines 2 and 4. In stanza 4 AE interference seems to be limited to a place name: Miami, the kind of borrowing Brecht's ballad of 1921 had practiced already: „Wohllaut der abendlichen Wasser von Miami". Euphonious as this vowel-saturated line surely is, euphony has it not all its own way in stanza 4. Mockery enters by the same cautious way as it did in the earlier poem: by speech level contrast. The formal, elevated level of „Unaufhalt- same Heiterkeit der über nie endende Straßen schnell fahrenden Geschlechter", a level suggestive of the Ancient Greek epic, is suddenly interrupted by a fake archaism, „Wei- ber", and a fake epic epitheton, „Breitbrüstig". Unlike ,breitbeinigť or breitschultrig', ,breitbrüstig' is rare in general German, although it does belong to a popular mor- phological type. It may have been chosen from among available German expressions under the impact of common AE 'broad-chested'.206 Admittedly, this assumption is without any direct proof. Yet, in the 1921 ballad Brecht was found to be surprisingly sensitive to homophonous cognates such as , island' and ,Eiland', inspite of the rarity of the latter in common German usage. Thus, 'broad-chested' may have stimulated the poet's preference for its German near-cognate, ,breitbriistig'. It is a genuine cognate as to its first constituent, a semantic equivalent as regards its second element, and a morphological close relation as concerns its pattern. The problem as such, AE 208 'Broad-breasted' would seem to be rare. It is included in Muret-Sanders, Encyclopaedic English-German and German-English Dictionary, Pt. II, New Ed. (Berlin-Schöneberg, n. d.), 218. There is no corresponding entry inPt. I, nor is 'broad-breasted' to be found in NWD AL.</page><page sequence="34">Stylistic Aspects of Linguistic Borrowing 131 interference by way of change of frequency of German cognates or near-cognates, deserves more attention than it has hitherto received. Similar to the two AE borrowings in stanza 2, both examples of interference in stanza 4, the certain and the dubious, are thrown into relief by devices of line con- struction. Miami holds last place, Breitbrüstige(n) is anaphoric, lexically as well as phrasally (Breitbrüstige[n] Männer [n]). Implicit ironical comment by way of exclama- tion is also common to both pairs of loans. In stanza 8 mockery grows more obvious, but as in Brechťs earlier ballad and in the fictitious newspaper letter of application its explicit target is Americanized Ger- many, not America itself. The process of Americanization is once again reflected in the Americanization not only of behavior and its models, but also of speech. Lexical borrowing starts as collocation of a generic loan translation proper (Kaugummi &lt; chewing gum) and a specific outright transfer (Beechnut). They are followed by a transfer without an explanatory loan translation or rendition: "poker face man". Lexical interference rises to a combination of semantic extension of a German homo- phone with morphological or, more precisely, inflectional interference: „Auch wir tappten unseren Gegenüber .../... an die Arme . . .". Normal G ,tippen', under the impact of its English semantic equivalent and near-homophone ,tapť has given way to tappen. Its usual meanings, 'to walk (or tramp) clumsily or heavily', 'to grope', 'to poke', 'to fumble',207 have been extended or rather superimposed on by the meaning of English 'to tap'. It is not impossible, though, that Brecht, a migrant from the High German speech area of Bavaria to the Low German area of Berlin, has adopted Low German dialectal ,tappen', cognate of ,tap', v. This would be in keeping with his above-mentioned sensitivity to German cognates of English words, no matter whether those cognates were infrequent in German standard usage or not. Gegenübers reveals use of an inflectional sign characteristic of the 'regular' plural of English substantives. This use is not uncommon in low German dialects. English interference, at this point, should be understood not as outright morphological transfer, but as conditioning Brechťs preference for a morphological cognate. Even in this limited sense, inflectional interference was facilitated by the awkwardness of ,Gegen- übern', the 'regular' dative plural of prescriptive grammar. Mockery at Americanized Germany as expressed by Americanized German vocab- ulary and morphology turns into parody on America proper. With the exception of an old lexical loan, „gestoppt werden", interference in stanzas 9, 11, 16 and 19 is uni- formly inflectional, and partly phrasal. American self-assurance manifesting itself in the grandiloquent use of the superlative is mimicked within well-selected contexts: Diese Maschinenhallen: die größten der Weltl (stanza 9) Diese Brücken: (stanza 9) Die längsten der Weltl Ihre Boxer die stärksten! (stanza 11) Ihre Erfinder die praktischsten ! Ihre Züge die schnellsten! (stanza 11) Auch die bevölkertsten ! (stanza 11) 207 Cf.

Sie verbinden (Die längsten der Welt') Schuttplätze jetzt mit Schuttplätzen! (stanza 16) Ihre Maschinen nämlich, heißt es, liegen in riesigen Haufen (den größten der Welt') Und rosten Wie die Maschinen der alten Welt (in kleineren Haufen). (stanza 19) Here devices of parody have changed in two respects: (1) the grandiloquent cliché, of phrase length and in the form of an exact reproduction, has been inserted into a context of contrary value („in riesigen Haufen . . . / Und rosten /"), (2) structural ambiguity. As a frequent potentiality of English syntax and as an actual device of modern American and British poetry, ambiguity may have been borrowed in „Sie verbinden / (Die längsten der Welt') Schuttplätze jetzt mit Schuttplätzen!" The translated, and mockingly reversed cliché, „Die längsten der Welt" (the longest in the world), might refer to the preceding „Sie" (i. e. Brücken) or to the following „Schuttplätze" or to both. Thus, borrowings to convey tone have ranged from radio play dialog via travel book and newspaper prose to humorous magazine verse and political poetry. Inter- ference of this sort, lexical, phrasal and inflectional, has proved to be a rich, though hidden, mine of information about stylistic aspects of borrowing. II. 7 More hidden still is the last case of stylistic motivation of interference: variation of expression. It was Rudolf Filipovié who, from the viewpoint of Croatian-English language contacts, recently re-emphasized this aspect of our problem.208 Variation of expression shows up in two types. One offers the native stock phrase or word jointly with the borrowed variant. The other omits the native item either entirely or at least in the narrow context of utterance. Type I prevails in written, type II in spoken language. The German literature of American travel furnishes a pertinent example of t y p e I : Die Stahlmühlen und -werke, die meilenlangen Werkshallen von Ford in Detroit . . . dies ist Fausts gegenwärtiges Antlitz.209 Stahlmühlen (&lt;AE steel mills), a loan translation proper on the basis of cognates, is a mere variation on »Stahlwerke*. "Specialization in content"210 is not involved. Hence, precision as a motivation of borrowing does not apply here. Neighbor to the travel book, the scholarly inquiry into the American mind, a type of book represented e. g. by Golo Mann's Vom Geist Amerikas, contributes further evidence for variation as a stylistic use of interference: 208 The Phonemic Analysis of English Loan-Words in Croatian, loc. cit., 11-12: "But very often Croatian writers use both the foreign word and its native equivalent for the variation of style." (The spacing is the present writer's). 209 Korn, Faust ging nach Amerika, 25-26. «io Weinreich, Languages in Contact, 55.</page><page sequence="36">Stylistic Aspects of Linguistic Borrowing 133 Stärker als irgend ein europäisches Land . . . zerfällt das Land der Vereinigten Staaten in Landschaften der verschiedensten Wirkung auf Geist und Sinn. Es gibt . . . vulkanische Zyklo- penlandschaften, tote Mondlandschaften. „Dieser Kontinent war nicht für Menschen gemeint", denkt man manchmal.211 „. . . nicht für Menschen gemeint" closely resembles 'not meant for human beings'. It appears to have been chosen in order to avoid normal ,nicht für Menschen ge- dachť, since another form of this word occurs immediately after: „denkt man manchmal". The rendering of 'meant' by gemeint is, of course, stimulated by its status as cognate, but for the phrase 'meant for', ,gedacht für* is the normal German equi- valent. To the two passages quoted as examples of 'variation' operating in written Ger- man there might be added two specimens taken from the dialogue of Ingeborg Bach- mann's radio play. Dialogue of this sort serves as a kind of half-way house between the written and the spoken language. I. Jennifer: Wie hat Ihnen Boston gefallen? Jan: Nun. Jennifer: ... Mögen Sie New York?212 Repetition of a German routine question, which forms part of the armory of con- versational small talk, is avoided by modeling, semantically and syntactically, a variant question on the English cliché 'Do you like . . .?' The use of »mögen* in con- texts like the one quoted is really felt to be a case of interference. „, Mögen Sie Picasso?' Die Formulierung dieser Frage im Cocktail-Jargon hat vielfach Verblüffung, gelegentlich sogar Ärger hervorgerufen."213 This open confession of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung illustrates German awareness of interference. In Ingeborg Bach- mann's Der gute Gott von Manhattan this 'jargon' functions partly as variation, partly as index to the nationality of the speaker. II. Guter Gott: Die Rhapsoden in den großen Druckereien griffen in die Setzmaschinen, kündeten die Geschehnisse und annoncierten Künftiges.214 The speaker has varied ,kündeten' by means of annoncierten, originally a French- borrowed term. In the three passages quoted before, variation proceeded by way of (1) loan translation proper {Stahlmühlen), (2) preference for a synonym which is not only a semantic equivalent but also a cognate {gemeint für &lt; meant for, instead of .gedacht für'), (3) reproduction of similar sentence structure: Mögen Sie 'New York? &lt; Do you like New York? The variation of ,kündeten' with the aid of annoncierten, however, presents a fourth technique, i. e. semantic extension. Normally 'annoncieren' primarily means 'advertize'. In the Bachmann play 'annoncierten' has come to render English 'announced', its cognate. As the context refers to the newspaper press, the normal meaning 'to advertize' is not entirely lost on annoncierten Künftiges'. The journalistic flavor of this phrase intensifies the tone of irony emerging from the 211 Op. cit., (2nd ed., Stuttgart, 1955), 5. 212 Der gute Gott von Manhattan, 15. 213 FAZ, Oct. 21, 1961. 214 Op. cit., 31.</page><page sequence="37">134 Hans Galinsky stylistic contrast of Greek-borrowed Rhapsoden', technical German »Setzmaschinen* and solemn German »kündeten*. Two stylistic uses of English, particularly AE, inter- ference - facilitating variation and conveying tone - have coalesced. So much for type I of the phenomenon of variation and its illustrations from written German, including written dialogue. Type II can be exemplified with the help of spoken German. It is illustrated best by O. K. It comes no less easy from the lips of German diplomats than from the lips of German teenagers and college freshmen. Its German and global vogue is usually explained in terms of the "prestige motive",215 the wish of the weaker to identify themselves with the stronger. This probably is not the whole truth. The social contact situation of giving one's approval or endorsement will repeat itself every day. The monotony of such routine situations calls for a compensating variety of expression. G Ja!*, ,Na ja!*, »Meinetwegen!*, ,Schön!*, ,Gut so!*, ,Schon gut!*, ,(Geht) in Ordnung*, etc. constitute a fairly small semantic field. O. K. furnishes a desirable addition to it. *Allons' *allez hopp' and ,Hallo*, the last of which I once heard coming from the lips even of a three year old, represent similar foreign borrowings. The first is a transfer from the French, the second an intensifying French-German combination, the third a transfer from English. They, too, do welcome service in such daily routine situations as *starting out to do something in company', and giving orders or warnings. II. 8 In retrospect, stylistic aspects of modern German borrowing from English, chiefly AE, include the following functions of interference: (1) providing national American color of settings, actions, and characters, (2) establishing or enhancing precision, (3) offering or facilitating intentional disguise, (4) effecting brevity to the point of terseness, (5) producing vividness, often by way of metaphor, (6) conveying tone, its gamut ranging from humorous playfulness to sneering parody on America and *Ameri- canizeď Germany, (7) creating or increasing variation of expression. Function 1 operates mainly in the written, especially the literary language; 2 serves in both written and spoken German, chiefly in professional terminology, e. g. scientific, political, commercial; 3 extends occasionally from professional to general communi- cation; 4-6 are most comprehensive, permeating any level of speech; 7 is restricted to literary style and routine situations on the informal level. These stylistic uses were seen affecting not only the vocabulary but also the mor- phology and, more rarely, the syntax as well. As regards lexical interference, practical- ly any type, from "outright transfer" to "loanblends" or "hybrid compounds", was involved. Integration processes were found to be of particular interest. The repattern- ing of German semantic fields under the impact of style-oriented AE interference proved to be especially rewarding, but also showed a need for closer investigation. The same applied to such indirect forms of interference as (1) change of frequency of German lexical cognates or near-cognates, (2) intensified use of German cognate patterns of word-formation. 215 Hodcett, A Course in Modern Linguistics, 404-405.</page><page sequence="38">Stylistic Aspects of Linguistic Borrowing 135 Passing on from summary to evaluation of results, the following points should be kept in mind. Differing in scope and method from valuable research done by Stivens, Ganz, Wilss, Zindler and Carstensen, the 'American-German contact' section of this paper was not meant to be a study in recent neologisms as such or in the intra- or extra-lingual conditions favoring or resisting AE/BE interference. Rather did it aim to help illuminate the still fairly obscure area of motivations. Limiting itself to one, complex, motivation only, the stylistic, the present inquiry dealt much less with regular interference phenomena on the part of speech communities than with occasional borrowings of language-conscious individuals. Most of them will have learned foreign languages as part of their schooling, some, partly as travelers, partly as temporary expatriates, e. g. Bertolt Brecht and Golo Mann, were bound to make use of what they had learned. Nearly all of them have experienced that new variety of a 'languages in contact' situation, the close living-together of speakers of American, British, and Canadian English with native speakers of German in West Central Europe. Indeed, one thing has become more certain than it had been before: there are stylistic aspects of linguistic borrowing. Nevertheless, a final word of caution is ap- propriate. With the exception of comic nonce-word creations, several loan renditions, some loanblends, some individual preferences for German cognates or near-cognates of American or generally English words, and a few new coinages on the basis of borrowed morphological patterns, all of the borrowings discussed had been introduced into German at an earlier date, i. e. prior to their occurrence in our materials. Stylistic considerations apparently have not caused their introduction, but promoted their diffusion. To what extent stylistic factors determine or co-determine the very first loan or several early loans of an AE item, cannot be ascertained without rigorous diachronic research. Will these tentative results both of substance and method remain valid if one puts them to the test of comparison, proceeding from American-German to American- British contact? The question adds to the inter-lingual the intra-lingual, inter-dialectal, aspect of the problem. Attempting an answer to it and drawing from this comparative study some general conclusions will be the subject of the complementary part of this paper.216 216 For a competent revision of this paper its author is greatly indebted to Miss Joy Nicholson and Mr. James Kenny.</page></plain_text>
