<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALAN BASS The Status of an Analogy: Psychoanalysis and Physics In his often cited Inward Bound, Abraham Pais (1986) views the years 1895-1905 as the most critical for understand ing the great revolution in physics. During that decade discov eries were made that produced the quantum theory and relativity, and thus the end of the unquestioned conceptions of energy and matter, space and time, derived from classical physics. At the conclusion of his overview of the decade Pais surprisingly cites one of Freud's letters to his friend, Wilhelm Fliess. Freud confides to Fliess that he is "not really a man of science, not an observer, not an experimenter, and not a thinker. I am by temperament nothing but a conquistador—an adventurer . . ." (cited in Pais 1986, 139). Pais comments that these "lines are especially fitting [my emphasis] since they were written in 1900 in the middle of the decade" (139) which produced the results, if not yet the theory, that would explode the presumed laws of nature. My entire topic is contained in Pais' word "fitting." For reasons he does not explain, it is "fitting," it accords well with his general understanding of how the revolution in physics came about, that the theory of mind, psychopathology, and treatment, finally formalized with the 1900 publication of The Interpretation of Dreams, should be viewed by Freud less as a "science" than as "adventure." Freud too was "inward bound." Why the analogy? If this private statement of Freud's is more than a coincidence, as Pais clearly seems to think, what makes it important? What does it give us to understand about the processes that simultaneously made possible psychoanalysis and the most important scientific revo lution of the twentieth century? If Pais is comparing Freud to any physicist in particular, I think it is to Max Planck, the father of the quantum theory. Pais says that if he had to choose "just one single discovery in American Imago, Vol. 54, No. 3, 235-256. © 1997 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 235</page><page sequence="2">236 The Status of an Analogy twentieth century physics as revolutionary," he would "un hesitatingly nominate" Planck's 1900 discovery of a constant, h, that accounted for anomalies in what physicists call "blackbody radiation." Blackbody radiation refers to the discharge pat terns of a body that re-emits any energy that enters it. Long before there were means to make measurements that would explain why blackbody radiation patterns were so strangely discontinuous, Planck was able to make an astonishingly accurate guess about an extremely small constant that resolved the enigma. Not content with his guess, and still a great believer in the laws of classical physics, Planck attempted to justify his results based on those laws. Very quickly, he came up with the quantum hypothesis of discrete, rather than continu ous, values for blackbody radiation spectra. This hypothesis worked quite well to explain his constant, which itself was receiving experimental verification. However, Planck realized that he had come up against an unexpected dilemma: the quantum hypothesis violated the laws from which he had started. Pais cites Planck's own account: "'I tried immediately to weld the elementary quantum of action h somehow into the framework of classical theory. But in the face of all such attempts, this constant showed itself to be obdurate. . . . My futile attempts to fit the elementary quantum of action into the classical theory continued for a number of years, and they cost me a great deal of effort'" (1986, 133). Similarly, says Pais, based on Planck's work, Einstein was able within the same decade to postulate the light quantum (i.e. the particle func tioning of what had been assumed to be a wave). Einstein also did so by the methods of classical physics, which of course the photon also went far to undermine. Pais portrays Planck and Einstein as "reluctant revolutionaries" whose aim was to use as rigorously as possible the principles and methods that hereto fore had functioned as indisputable laws of nature. Once they realized that their first principles had to be changed, they were compelled to adventure into uncharted territory. Pais' point about Freud's 1900 description of himself is that at just about the same time, Freud knew that he had the same dilemma: he had wanted to elaborate a psychology that would explain neurosis from within the classical conception of science, but</page><page sequence="3">Alan Bass 237 also found himself in the position of an adventurer. The question of course is whether the "coincidence" goes even further, and whether the postulation of a theory of mind and psychotherapy based on unconscious processes that made Freud into a "conquistador" has any structural similarity to the revolution in physics. I do not know whether I will be able to answer this question. Perhaps we will come a bit closer to better ways of posing it, which is always the most essential step. I propose to situate some of the places where one has to begin to think about such issues, for the simple reason that Freud himself raises them. Moreover, the question of the analogy to physics has begun to come up in the debates that divide contemporary Freudians. To orient a progression through some of Freud's own analogies to physics, I would like to start by giving examples of the contemporary debate, both international and American. In 1992 Cesar and Sara Botella wrote in the Revue française de psychanalyse, the official journal of the Paris Psychoanalytic Society: Dialogue with other sciences will pose apparently insur mountable problems not so much, as has too often been thought, because of the scientist's resistance to psycho analysis, due to his own repressions, but because of the conceptions profoundly incompatible with the rational ity necessary for all positivist scientific thought, at least such as it has existed until very recently. Perhaps now, with the revolution introduced by relativity, quantum theory and their successors, which profoundly modified scientific thought, a dialogue between analysts and sci entists is possible. It pleases us to imagine that analytic theory, with its major concept of unconscious represen tation, might be, at the very heart of the evolution of scientific thought, the primary model of a new concep tion of science capable of breaking with the limits imposed by preconscious logic, by temporo-spatiality, and by the ego's need to believe in tangible evidence. (24) '</page><page sequence="4">238 The Status of an Analogy On the other side, so to speak, Charles Hanly, an eminent Canadian analyst and professor of philosophy, wrote in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis in 1995: The idea of a 'post-positivist era' is ambiguous and misleading. ... If what is meant by 'post-positivist era is that... the epistemological and ontological premises of Freud's work, which are shared by natural science, have now been relegated to the history of ideas, the assertion that ours is a post-positivist era is simply false. . . . The post-positivist thesis is not infrequently supported by the argument that quantum physics has proven that the observer always influences the observed and that, there fore, quantum mechanics justifies the complacent view that the analyst's subjectivity cannot be subtracted from the patient's associations. But, in order to make the argument sound, it is necessary to demonstrate the factual basis of the implied analogy between the condi tions of observation of sub-atomic particles in physics and the conditions of observation in clinical psycho analysis. Quantum mechanical laws apply to sub-atomic particles the velocity and position of which can only be characterized statistically with inverse exactitude [Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]. Physicists are un certain about how to interpret this fact ontologically. Some physicists suppose that the uncertainty principle describes the inherent nature of the behavior of protons and neutrons. Others suppose that the phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that, in order to observe the position and velocity of sub-atomic particles, it is neces sary to have them interact with light and no method can be devised to observe this interaction in the absence of the particles reacting to light. It cannot be taken for granted that either of these interpretations can be used as premises for a correct understanding of the cognitive and observational activities involved in clinical psycho analysis. Nevertheless, some analysts can lightly repudi ate, on the basis of this dubious analogy, Freud's episte mology, which warranted his quest for objectivity, as being a naive, antiquated adherence to a nineteenth</page><page sequence="5">Alan Bass 239 century Newtonian point of view without pausing to consider that all of us live our lives in a reality governed by the laws of Newtonian mechanics (which, of course, can be derived, mathematically, as a special case of relativity theory), or that all the sciences that study phenomena of greater magnitude than atoms and lesser magnitude than the solar system employ, for the most part, explanatory laws of the same basic conceptual form as nineteenth-century physics. . . . (904-905) Although it would take too long to spell out the different levels of inference in the two citations—the Botellas' emphasis on the status of unconscious representation, Hanly's on the knowability of subjectivity—it remains that the contrast be tween them is stark. Claiming allegiance to Freudian prin ciples, the analogy to quantum physics is either necessary or misleading. But note that Hanly does not reject the analogy with physics totally: he says that the principles of causality that determine psychic events, and guide the analyst's work, are those of Newtonian, classical physics. His claim is that the "reality" in which we live, including the unconscious reality which is the province of analytic work, is the same as that which now allows us to see the classical view not as an error, but as a special case of the larger quantum and relativistic views. The Botellas' claim is the opposite, i.e. that unconscious reality is more like the larger quantum and relativistic views, and that it was the limitations of the classical "special case" that made dialogue between psychoanalysis and physics next to impos sible. More locally, an entire recent issue of The Psychoanalytic Quarterly was devoted to the question of "Knowledge and Authority in the Analytic Relationship." Elizabeth Mayer, one of the most ardent supporters of exactly the position Hanly contests, took great pains to use the analogy to quantum physics precisely. She agreed that most often the psychoana lytic references to the Heisenberg principle distort its mean ing, which is really about the fundamental limits nature imposes upon knowledge. Most physicists themselves, she notes, simply accept the reality that knowledge of position and velocity of sub-atomic particles is probabilistic, rather than</page><page sequence="6">240 The Status of an Analogy certain, and move on from there. For Mayer the power of the analogy is that it still compels analysts to think about the ways in which causal or predictive knowledge is generated, an idea for which she claims Freudian descent. It is not a question of direct application of quantum physics to psychoanalysis, which is always full of exacdy the pitfalls Hanly described, but rather of how to move psychoanalysis out of the limited rationality which it has done as much as physics to undermine—exacdy the position Hanly rejects. Inevitably, in the same issue of The Psychoanalytic Quarterly, Charles Brenner, perhaps the dean of American classical analysis, takes exacdy the reverse position: The problem of the influence of observation on data is a general problem. It arises in every field of scientific inquiry, not just in psychoanalysis. The fact that Heisenberg demonstrated that it is logically inconceiv able that one can simultaneously determine both the position and the velocity of an electron, because of the influence of the observer on the observed, does not mean that one cannot, for example, accurately weigh a chemical sample or determine the temperature of liq uid. In both the latter examples the presence and activity of the observer does, in fact, influence the result, but one can safely disregard that influence. It is not great enough to matter, whereas in the case of an electron, the influence is too great to disregard. . . . Similarly in psychoanalysis . . . the question is whether the observer's influence is a significant one for the purpose of the observations made.... I believe that in a properly conducted analysis or, if one prefers, in a proper analytic situation the effect of the observer on the data is not so great as to render the data unreliable for the purpose to which one hopes to put them, i.e. as a basis for understanding the nature and origin of a patient's conflicts and, by extension, as a basis for conveying that understanding to a patient. (1996, 28-29) The point of Brenner's argument, like Hanly's, is that it would be a mistake to move away from the kind of causality associated with classical physics in order to understand unconscious</page><page sequence="7">Alan Bass 241 processes. They would not class Freud as the kind of "reluctant revolutionary" Pais claims that Planck and Einstein, and im plicidy Freud himself, were. For those who reject the analogy with quantum physics, but evidently not with physics itself, Freud's revolution consisted in applying classical causality to a region where it had not been applied before, that part of the mind which is not conscious. For the supporters of the analogy, this is certainly how Freud started, like his contemporaries in physics, but definitely not where he wound up. What do Freud's own analogies to physics teach us about this debate and the status of the analogy? Freud proposed the analogy very early on. In 1894 he wrote a short article, "The Neuro-Psychoses of Defense," which is essential to his entire enterprise. In it, he begins to part company with Breuer, with whom he had already published in 1893 a "Preliminary Communication" to what would eventually be the Studies on Hysteria. Freud differs from Breuer on a fundamental question: what really causes certain memories to be unavailable to consciousness, to the pre-condition for hysteri cal symptom formation? Breuer proposes a quasi-organic ex planation, the "hypnoid state," while Freud proposes what is arguably his most fundamental idea—defense. In other words, to understand why "hysterics suffer from reminiscences," one must understand the process that allows them to eject certain memories from consciousness. Further, one then needs a conception of what makes it possible to eject memories from consciousness at all, so that one can explain theoretically why recall should have a therapeutic function. Freud offers a hypothesis and a provisional analogy: I should like, finally, to dwell for a moment on the working hypothesis which I have made use of in this exposition of the neuroses of defence. I refer to the concept that in mental functions something is to be distinguished—a quota of affect or sum of excitation— which possesses all the characteristics of a quantity (though we have no means of measuring it), which is capable of increase, diminution, displacement, and dis charge, and which is spread over the memory traces of ideas somewhat as an electric charge is spread over the</page><page sequence="8">242 The Status of an Analogy surface of a body. This hypothesis, which incidentally, already underlies our theory of abreaction in our 'Pre liminary Communication,' can be applied in the same sense as physicists apply in the hypothesis of a flow of electric fluid. It is provisionally justified by its utility in coordinating and explaining a great variety of psychical states (1894, 60-61). As he elaborates the idea that was to make psychoanalysis psychoanalysis, i.e. defense, Freud compares it to what he knew was one of the most important questions in the physics of his day. Although he departs from Breuer's idea of an alleged hypnoid state to explain the origin of hysterical symptoms, he agrees with Breuer that recall of split off memories with their full affective charge, i.e. abreaction, is the specific means to reverse these symptoms. What abreaction does, Freud explains here, is to reverse the defense process that has removed the memory and the affect from normal consciousness. He agrees with Breuer too that to explain the effect of abreaction one must begin to think about the distribution of mental energy. Thus, the problem now is to understand the energies of defense. One gains a provisional insight into the energies of defense by comparing the way in which memories may or may not be conscious to the physical properties of electricity. Now, before the discovery of radiation, throughout the nineteenth century the study of electricity had been the most important impetus into the investigation of the atom, and especially into the relation between the atom and discharge phenomena. Freud's analogy implicitly links the discharge nature of abreaction to the discharge phenomenon of electric ity. He compares this discharge to what would usually be considered a purely intentional, mental phenomenon: de fense. The comparison also implies that progress in physics will provide progress in understanding why the therapy of hysteria takes place at the intersection of what are conventionally called mind and body, defense and energy. Although there are many other equally important ways in which Freud situates psychoanalysis outside the traditional mind-body opposition— the idea of psycho-sexuality being the most obvious example—</page><page sequence="9">Alan Bass 243 it is not usually understood that the energies of defense are for him the original point of intersection. In a letter to Fliess about a year later, Freud complains: "Psychology is really a cross to bear.... All I was trying to do was explain defense, but just try to explain something from the very core of nature!" (136). The very core of nature is exactly what the "reluctant revolutionaries" in physics were investigating in terms of the classical theory available to them: how to conceive the atom or light itself in order to understand something like electricity, and eventually other forms of particle emission. Such investiga tions changed the basic understanding of matter and energy, space and time. Does the question of the "energies of defense" move in a similar direction, or is it more conceivable in terms of the classical conceptions which continue to function well as special cases of the larger quantum and relativistic principles? The "bio-energetics of defense" is one of the principle topics of Freud's famous 1895 manuscript, the Project for a Scientific Psychology, the basis for so much of his later work. Freud begins by saying that his "intention is to furnish a psychology that shall be a natural science: that is, to represent psychical processes as quantitatively determinate states of specifiable material particles" (295). In this text not written for publication, Freud seems to be taking his hypothesis about mental energy from the year before one step further. Where there was at first no means of measuring mental energy, the wager of the Project is that there might be. Once mental energy is quantifiably determinate, and once the physical matter it affects is determined, psychology can be a science. Kant's famous assertion that psychology would never be a science because nothing within it was quantifiable might then be disqualified. The analogy to physics is all the more immedi ately compelling. Calling mental energy Q, Freud speaks of it in the language of classical physics: "What distinguishes activity from rest is to be regarded as Q, subject to the general laws of motion" (1895, 295), i.e. the laws of Newtonian physics. In other words, mental energy necessarily obeys the same laws as any other kind of energy, as established by the physics that was still mostly unquestioned in 1895. As a problem from the core of nature, defense would have to be explicable in terms of the</page><page sequence="10">244 The Status of an Analogy laws of that core. With the benefit of hindsight, one immedi ately sees the paradox here. The classical conceptions of matter and energy, space and time, were part and parcel of the classical conception of mind. "Mind" equated with conscious subjectivity, and the ideas that "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics," are the products of the work of Descartes and Galileo, the "giants" on whose shoulders New ton said he stood. There is every reason to understand why Freud would use his knowledge of the laws of nature to theorize about how mental energy functions. But does the fact that he is describing the "energies" of processes that occur outside of consciousness, and outside the classical conception of mind, also compel one to rethink one's assumptions about energy? The question is certainly anachronistic. Freud's gesture in 1895 is to demonstrate the scientificity of processes occurring outside of consciousness by showing them to be comprehen sible in terms that all natural scientists could agree upon. One could say that Hanly's and Brenner's opposition to any analo gies to quantum physics rest on exactly this assumption: mental energy operates from within the frame of reference in which the classical laws still hold, even if they are not as universally valid as previously assumed. However, one can ask whether Freud was doing for the mind what Planck was soon to do for the atom: making a discovery that answered questions that could not be answered before, but which undermined the laws of nature which were his point of departure. Here we come upon one of the most familiar topics in Freud scholarship, to wit, that Freud always conceived uncon scious processes in terms of both the second law of thermody namics, a conception that appears throughout his work, culmi nating in the idea of the death instinct, and in terms of the Newtonian concept of the inertia of bodies in motion. How ever accurate or inaccurate Freud's understanding of these laws, particularly when applied to the concept of mental energy, there is no doubt that the analogy remained crucial for him. He states it immediately in the Project in order to integrate what he calls "pathological clinical observation," i.e. what he</page><page sequence="11">Alan Bass 245 felt he had seen in his work on the neuroses, with the energies of stimulus, substitution, conversion and discharge, which . . . directly suggested the conception of neuronal excitation as quantity in a state of flow.... Starting from this consideration, it was possible to lay down a basic principle of neuronal activity in relation to Q, which promised to be highly enlightening, since it appeared to comprise the entire function [my emphasis]. This is the principle of neuronal inertia: that neurons tend to divest themselves of Q. On this basis the structure and development as well as the functions [of neuroses] are to be understood. (1895, 296) One again understands Freud's reasoning. Neuroses ob servably have something to do with getting rid of distur bances—i.e. of memories incompatible with consciousness— and they compel the postulation of processes of energy regulation occurring outside of consciousness. If both factors also point in the direction of a tendency toward inertia, the neuroses are explicable in terms of a nonconscious, mental equivalent of this tendency. It must be stated immediately that the dangers of analogistic thinking are evident here. As Laplanche (1975) has shown, Freud tends to amalgamate the Newtonian law of inertia with the second principle of thermo dynamics. They are not the same of course. Nonetheless, the neuroses reveal something about what Freud calls the "entire function" of the non-conscious part of the mental apparatus. This function is not so conspicuous if one only observes the psyche from the point of view of its supposedly non-pathologi cal state. The entire Freudian enterprise, such that a theory of the neuroses can also yield a revolutionary theory of mind in general, is then based on this analogy to physics, whatever the inaccuracies of the analogy. When Freud says that "discharge represents the primary function of the nervous system" (1895, 296), he is attempting to vindicate the unusualness of his theory by inferring that it ultimately allows the most scientific</page><page sequence="12">246 The Status of an Analogy conception of mind, because of its intersection with classical physics. The question of energies of defense is even more crucial in this context. Because Freud wants to make the question of neurosis synonymous with the question of defense, he again integrates an apparently intentional process with the "primary function" of the mental apparatus to seek inertia. Therefore, at this very early stage of his theory, defense has to have the characteristics of the primary process, as Freud goes on to demonstrate. If the larger, non-conscious part of the mind seeks inertia, it follows the basic tendency to get rid of unwanted energy. The pleasure-unpleasure principle describes the attaining of pleasure by the elimination of unpleasurable raised energy levels. Thus Freud says that "since we have certain knowledge of a trend in psychical life towards avoiding unpleasure, we are tempted to identify that trend with the primary trend towards inertia" (1895, 312). There are two basic ways to avoid unpleasure in this scheme. One is to revive with hallucinatory intensity the memory of the experience of satisfaction which had previously put an end to unpleasure; this is the wish. The other is to withdraw from the registration of the unpleasure; this is defense. Both, then, functioning according to the tendency to inertia: "The wishful state results in a positive attraction towards the object wished for, or, more precisely, towards it mnemic image; the experience of pain leads to a repulsion, a disinclination to keeping the hostile mnemic image cathected. Here we have primary wishful attrac tion and primary defense" (312). The conscious, affective lan guage of satisfaction and pain is translated into the physical, energic language of attraction and repulsion. And Freud immediately notes that the attraction to a memory of satisfac tion for purposes of discharge is more easily explained than what he calls "primary defense or repression—the fact that hostile mnemic image is regularly abandoned by its cathexis as soon as possible" (312). And then later, in a discussion that concludes with the assertion that the "first biological rule" is "that of primary defense," Freud comes back to the difficulty of accounting for defense as intrinsic to the primary function of the psychic apparatus. He says:</page><page sequence="13">Alan Bass 247 Everything that I call a biological acquisition of the ner vous system is in my opinion represented by a threat of unpleasure... the effect of which consists in the fact that those neurons which lead to a release of unpleasure are not cathected. This is primary defense, an understand able consequence of the original trend of the nervous system. . . . How primary defense, non-cathexis owing to a threat of unpleasure, is to be represented mechani cally—this, I confess, I am unable to say. (1895, 370) At the moment of explaining the "first biological rule" which seems to be an inevitable result of the application of the physical laws of energy to mental processes, the possibility of a mechanical representation of primary defense breaks down. The analogy no longer works. Can one simply chalk this problem up to the improvisatory nature of this manuscript? I think not, for one evident reason, and then for a host of less evident reasons. The evident reason is that Freud has consis tently linked the tendency to counter the primary function of the apparatus to seek inertia to what he calls "the exigencies of life" (1895, 297). That is, if the mental apparatus is to keep the organism alive, for example by taking in nourishment, it cannot only react to hunger with wishful revival of a previous experience of hunger relief, or with withdrawal of cathexis from the tension of hunger. Therefore, the apparatus "is obliged to abandon its original trend to inertia. ... All the functions of the nervous system can be comprised either under the aspect of the primary function or of the secondary one imposed by the exigencies of life" (297). The idea is that registration of a disturbing tension belongs to the secondary process. If the idea of primary defense is an inevitable outcome of the principle of inertia, and if it implies an automatic withdrawal of cathexis from a disturbing tension, then some how registration of such tension also has to occur on the primary level. This is an apparent contradiction in terms, since it does not obey the tendency to inertia, no matter how automatically the tendency then works to eliminate the tension. In other words, there is something like a "secondary function" already at work at the heart of primary defense and the</page><page sequence="14">248 The Status of an Analogy tendency to inertia. This function resists mechanical represen tation because it undermines the assumption of the law on which it is based. One must not forget that this is a clinical theory. Freud wants to explain why primary wish fulfillment and primary defense working together in neurosis produce the inertia which a coherent psychotherapy has to overcome. Anyone who has ever been involved with psychoanalysis, from either side of the couch, knows that however one conceives it, the problem of overcoming psychic inertia is the most essential and difficult clinical issue. Note the paradox then: contained within what seems to be the most inevitable expression of the principle of inertia, i.e., primary defense, is something that contradicts that principle. My question: Can primary defense not be repre sented mechanically because it is outside the realm of mechan ics, while simultaneously showing why such mechanics would appear to govern the "entire function" of the psyche? In other words, to come back to the question of the larger analogy, just as quantum physics and relativity did not invalidate classical physics, but showed it to be a special case whose laws were not as universally applicable as had been assumed, has Freud here come up against the condition that would make the analogy to classical laws of energy as limited as it is inevitable? Does a concept of primary defense, if it is to have some energic explanation, also show the primary tendency to inertia to be a special case of other energic processes? I do not think that this is a question that Freud would have put to himself. The issue is to see whether or not the question itself is a productive one. At several junctures Freud associates difficult innovations in his own theory with the contemporary advances in physics, both for their specific content and for the ways in which they affect theory building in general. In my own view, there are implications for the understanding of defense in all these analogies. Three examples, one from an apparently major and one from an apparently minor moment of his work, and one from a letter. 1. As he introduces the concept of narcissism Freud is aware that he is about to throw a monkey wrench into his entire theory. However provisional and contorted his new</page><page sequence="15">Alan Bass 249 distinctions between object libido and ego libido, between sexual instincts and ego instincts, Freud knows that his overrid ing problem is that the concept of narcissism upsets the heretofore axiomatic nature of an intrinsic conflict between the ego and sexuality. Narcissism implies, as Freud says, an original libidinal investment in the ego. In fact, narcissism is the original state of the psyche, before it is possible to speak of sexuality as a force unto itself. Freud writes: "... as regards the differentiation of psychical energies, we are led to the conclu sion that to begin with, during the state of narcissism, they exist together and that our analysis is too coarse to distinguish between them; not until there is object-cathexis is it possible to discriminate a sexual energy—the libido—from an energy of the ego-instincts" (1914, 76). In other words, the entire con ception of the psychic apparatus based on the original theory of dreams and neurosis is a special case of other ways to think about psychic energy. These other ways become necessary when Freud realizes that the clinical technique derived from the original theory encounters obstacles as soon as it tackles even what he calls the "narcissistic attitude" in neurotics. It is not an accident that as he attempts to theorize a problem that seems to undermine the postulates on which it is based, Freud uses the analogy to physics. If he had expressed confidence in the basic properties of energy, matter, and motion as elabo rated by physics in the Project of 1895 (304), he justifies the undermining of his own energic theories by comparison to a similar undermining in physics. He is well aware that to posit a form of psychic energy that precedes the distinction between ego instincts and sexual instincts . . . must occasion perceptible uneasiness in every psychoanalyst. ... It is true that notions such as that of an ego-libido, an energy of the ego-instincts, and so on, are neither particularly easy to grasp, nor sufficiently rich in content; a speculative [i.e. philosophical, in the idealist sense] theory of the relations in question would begin by seeking to obtain a sharply defined concept as its basis. But I am of the opinion that that is just the difference between a speculative theory and a science</page><page sequence="16">250 The Status of an Analogy erected on empirical observation. The latter will not envy speculation its privilege of having a smooth, logi cally unassailable foundation, but will gladly content itself with nebulous, scarcely imaginable basic concepts. . . . The same thing is happening in our day in the science of physics, the basic notions of which as regards matter, centers of force, attraction, etc., are scarcely less debatable than the corresponding notions in psycho analysis. (1914, 77) Freud's reasoning here is very much of the kind we have been tracing. Narcissism represents an anomaly for the theory and practice that lead to its formulation, just as his constant did for Planck. To explain the anomaly, the previous theory has to be pushed, or even overturned; the previous theory that had explained so much becomes a special case. One could even go further, and say that by positing a difficult to under stand initial form of psychic energy, in which ego instincts and sexual instincts are indistinguishable, Freud is already begin ning to think of energy inherent to structure, a basic idea in relativity, instead of energy as a disturbance external to struc ture, the more classical view. He is perhaps aware that treating the relation between energy and structure in a mechanical way cannot explain the vital clinical and theoretical problem of narcissism. To return all too elliptically to the problem of defense, it is not frequently noted that Freud comes to see narcissism itself as the precondition for repression: "For the ego the formation of an ideal would be the conditioning factor of repression. . . . The subject's narcissism makes its appear ance displaced on to this new ideal ego . . ." (1914, 94). When placed in conjunction with the way in which the postulation of narcissism leads to the analogies to the revolution of physics, this linkage of narcissism and defense again leads to the problem we found in the Project: why do the mechanical analogies, with their clear conceptions of matter, motion, and energy derived from classical physics, break down when it comes to understanding the most basic psychoanalytic idea— defense? Does the linkage of narcissism and defense make defense an even more compelling problem from "the core of</page><page sequence="17">Alan Bass 251 nature," once narcissism itself is understood both as the precondition for repression and as the clinical question that demands new ways of thinking about psychic energy? 2. Seven years later, in 1921, Freud uses the analogy again, in the highly significant context of his first paper on telepathy. He justifies his interest in this "occult" phenomenon in part by comparing the evolution of the sciences to the great revolution towards which we are heading and of whose extent we can form no estimate. . . . Some, indeed, of the proceedings of the exact sciences them selves may have contributed to this development. The discovery of radium has confused no less than it has advanced the possibilities of explaining the physical world; and the knowledge that has been so very recently acquired of what is called the theory of relativity has had the effect upon many of those who admire without comprehending it of diminishing their belief in the objective trustworthiness of science. You will remember that not long ago Einstein himself took occasion to protest against such misunderstanding. (1921,177-178) Was Freud aware of the discomfort occasioned by the discovery of radioactive particle emission, so dramatically seen in the prediction and discovery of radium, because it revived the old alchemical project of transforming one element into another? He certainly seems to be alluding to some of the simplest misconceptions of relativity, i.e. that it spelled the end of the discovery of objective laws that govern external reality. And he goes on to state the credo of the "reluctant" revolutionary in science, when he says that "analysts are at bottom incorrigible mechanists and materialists" (179). However, and here is the catch, although he proposes to investigate the occult phenom enon of telepathy from within the "determinist standards ... of mechanical science," by means of "ruthless insistence on the magnitude of the forces, the masses and qualities of the material concerned," he knows that the application of these standards to the "mysterious unconscious" will provoke the same "collapse of values" provoked by the discoveries of</page><page sequence="18">252 The Status of an Analogy radium and relativity. It is particularly relevant to all the questions raised by the "energies of defense" that there is a direct link between Freud's eventual explanation of telepathy as "thought transference," i.e. as a form of unconscious recep tion of an other's thought, and a little noted modification of the theory of the defense of projection. In an article written at the same time as the one on telepathy, "Some Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia, and Homosexuality" (1922), Freud goes back over very old ground, and answers some of his own questions about projection by giving the same energic explanation of it as he does of telepathy or "thought transfer ence." In fact, he uses an electrical analogy, and rebaptizes projection as "switching." Freud himself does not make ex plicit that his explanations of telepathy and projection are the same (a question I have examined elsewhere [Bass, 1992]). What is significant is that he returns to the question of the energies of defense as he speaks of the changes in understand ing energy that emerged from following the "determinist standards of mechanical science" to the point at which they compel their own rethinking. 3. In the history of quantum physics, greatest credit for this rethinking of "the determinist standards of mechanical science" is usually given to Niels Bohr. It is well known that Einstein had fundamental objections to Bohr's probabilistic conception of subatomic particles and their properties. One might have expected Freud to be less sympathetic to Bohr than to Einstein in this debate, but there is epistolary evidence that at the very least Freud was intrigued by the fundamental revision of determinism contained in Bohr's work. When one recalls the extent to which Freud's conception of the uncon scious depends upon classical determinism, his late sympathy for Bohr is noteworthy. The story is that on October 20, 1932 Marie Bonaparte wrote to Freud that she had met Bohr in Copenhagen. Bonaparte was troubled by what Bohr told her, and wrote to Freud that she could not "accept one of the points of his theories which he explained to us: namely the 'free will' of the atom. The atom is now to be excluded from determinism" (cited in Schur 1965,10). Bonaparte's objection is not unlike Einstein's, although put in anthropomorphic terms ("free will"). In other words, a double bind, like the kind</page><page sequence="19">Alan Bass 253 induced by relativity and the discovery of radium: Bohr's physics put into question one of the underlying principles that had defined science, or at least classical science, itself, namely determinism. Freud wrote back to Bonaparte: "What you tell me about the great physicist is really very remarkable. It is here that the breakdown of today's Weltanschauung is actually taking place" (Schur 1965, 11). The word Weltanschauung is very loaded for Freud. A Weltanshcauung is exactly what psycho analysis is not and should not aim to be, as he was soon to explain in his lecture on the topic (1933). This lecture actually goes back to ideas first put forward in Totem and Taboo (1912), on the wishful, animistic, and projective, defensive nature of every Weltanschauung. Thus, in his estimation, Bohr's challenge to classical determinism is in the spirit of psychoanalytic science, which always moves in the direction of the breakdown of Weltanschauungen. It would be possible to demonstrate that Freud's entire conception of psychopathology implies that compromise formation itself always creates the illusion of a Weltanschauung, in order to keep away from consciousness that which seems to disturb its equilibrium. Here, we once more come back to the basic idea of defense, and to the intriguing idea that Freud was receptive to Bohr's ideas because they compelled the breakdown of what had not even seemed to be a defensive structure—determinism itself. From a different point of view that does not focus so much on the question of defense, Hans Loewald has asked a series of similar questions. To cite only one particularly relevant pas sage, which again alleges that psychoanalysis compels an examination of certain ways of thinking not as errors, but as special cases, Loewald writes: Our hitherto normal form of organizing reality, aiming at a strict distinction and separation between an inter nal, subjective, and an external, objective world, is in question. . . . We even need to reexamine Freud's distinction between psychic reality and factual, objective reality, not that this distinction might be invalid. But its validity appears to be more circumscribed and limited than we assumed, analogous to Newtonian physics: the new theories and discoveries of modern physics do not</page><page sequence="20">254 The Status of an Analogy invalidate Newtonian physics, but they limit their appli cability. (1980, 403-404) For Loewald, in fact, the most important moment in Freud's energic thinking that shows him beginning to step outside the classical framework, is the one at which Freud seems to take this conflation of the principles of inertia and entropy to their apogee: the postulation of the death instinct in 1920. Like almost all rigorous readers of Freud, Loewald asserts that the death instinct is the inevitable outcome of the principle of neuronic inertia from the Project. He says that what is new in the second theory of the drives is the concept of Eros as a principle of raising energy levels that does not obey the tendency automatically to get rid of tension and to return to a previous state. Eros then implies psychic energy not regulated by the analogy to the classical laws. As Loewald at several points emphasizes, Freud, at the end of his life, straightforwardly said that the death instinct obeys the tendency to reduce tension, the principle of "inertia," while Eros does not. Loewald asserts further that one of the advantages of the concept of Eros is that it allows analysts to think of energy as inherent to psychic structure, just as relativity allowed physicists to think of energy inherent to matter. This is why Loewald finds an important link between Eros and narcissism, particularly primary narcis sism. Essentially, he sees Freud's initial assimilation of uncon scious processes to a principle of inertia as co-extensive with a view of psychic energy as something that imposes itself upon psychic structure, creating a disturbing tension. With the concept of Eros, it becomes possible to understand psychic structure as itself inherently energic. Had Loewald been aware of Pais' comparison of Freud to the reluctant revolutionaries who produced quantum theory and relativity, I think that he would have seen the postulation of the concept of Eros in 1920 as the most "adventurous" of Freud's energic theories. Loewald explicitly compares the results of the postulation of Eros to the way in which Einstein was able to show why the Newtonian view that energy is outside matter, rather than intrinsic to it, is a special case. In fact, and by implication again like Pais, Loewald thinks that this revolu tionary idea is as psychoanalytic as it is physical:</page><page sequence="21">Alan Bass 255 Ego and id are psychoanalytic constructs that. . . make use of the conception of the equivalence of energy and structure ..., a conception that has been used in physics and has revolutionized it. Psychology has been no less revolutionized by the use of that conception in psycho analysis, which is not to say that Freud was clearly aware of using it. It is an idea that . . . was made use of in various contexts, among them physics and psychoanaly sis. . . . That the same conception has been used in psychoanalysis does not mean that psychoanalysis has taken it over from physics or that it is physical in nature and thus not really applicable in psychological dis course. (1980, 111) If one takes seriously Loewald's idea that psychoanalysis may be more responsible for the notion of equivalence of structure and energy than having borrowed it, we have some thing more than an "analogy" between physics and psycho analysis. And it must be stated that Loewald views the "analogy" as entirely clinical, the basis for a more scientific understand ing of "the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis." To return to the debate over the accuracy of the analogies to physics, Loewald's contention most certainly would be that with the concept of Eros, Freud situates the reality of unconscious processes, the unconscious reality in which we live, outside the classical framework. Thus, he would have to disagree with those who maintain that the reality the analyst deals with is comparable to the reality within which the classical laws work perfectly well. Pushing Loewald's reading of the life and death instincts, one could even say that he shows why within the psyche the classical laws would be the limited, defensive version of the larger scope of the non-classical laws. In that case, all the implications of viewing energy as inherent to structure, including the rethink ing of causality and determinism, would have to be taken into account within psychoanalysis. The objections to the "analo gies" with quantum physics and relativity, as we have seen, are that clinical psychoanalysis does not concern processes "small" enough or "large" enough to warrant the rethinking of matter and energy, space and time, intrinsic to non-classical physics.</page><page sequence="22">256 The Status of an Analogy However, there has always been a question about the transition between "levels:" what are the transition points between quan tum indeterminacy and predictive determinacy, between rela tivistic space-time and mechanical space and time? Could it be that the ways in which psychoanalysis has to think about the energies of defense, such that the analogy to classical physics has both compelling force and yet begins to break down in crucial ways, reveals just such a transition? Does the concept of unconscious processes compel analogies to both the classical conceptions of energy and motion (entropy and inertia) and to non-classical ones (Eros and beyond)? 27 West 96th St. IF New York, NY 10025 References Bass, Alan. 1992.
