<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetic Biology: A Defense and Manifesto Michael T. Ghiselin WESTERN THINKERS have traditionally emphasized strong diremp- tions between the sciences and the arts. Biologists, so we are told, view the world with cold dispassion; poets suffuse it with warmth and feeling. The appropriate literary style ought to differ, one might think, as befits polar opposites, and the similarities would be restricted to the bare skeleton of whatever may be common to language in general. There is just enough truth in this position that it readily becomes overemphasized or even passes unquestioned. To be sure, no- body would argue that a poet's nightingale and an ornithologist's study- skin reside in different habitats. Yet the poet and the ornithologist them- selves remain human beings very much alike, and may even be the same individual. However useful the contrasts may be, they obscure funda- mental resemblances.' Both artist and scientist seek to discover some- thing, to find gratification in that discovery, and to express their vision of the universe in a pleasing literary form. The habit of casting scientists and humanists as paired cliches to some extent reflects the philistine obsession with base utility. Science, unlike art, is supposed to be useful. I dare say no scientist worthy of the name would agree. Science by definition has to be pure-it bears the same relation to technology as art does to decoration. Humanistic science and humanistic art alike strive to elevate mankind above matter, not force us to grovel in it. Yet this does not rule out a more refined utilitarian role for science or art. The enjoyment of higher values exists for sound biological reasons.2 It gives us something to live for beyond struggling for the means of subsistence. Hence it must be envisioned as an ultimately moral activity-as the basis of civilization itself. Only those who fail to separate ethics from psychology will speak of art or science "for its own sake." They exist for the sake of the artists and the scientists and for the sake of all mankind. On the other hand, our various spiritual, aesthetic, and intellectual faculties satisfy different needs. Shelley concluded that "poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world." By this he meant that they provide direction for our lives. By analogy we might say that scientists. are the unacknowledged judiciary. However, it is not the task of science to pass judgment upon anyone. Science appeals to us because it places the search for truth before any mundane expediency. Its pursuit is noble, good, and biologically significant, because our knowledge of the truth-</page><page sequence="2">494 NEW LITERARY HISTORY is necessary if there is to be justice. Men may argue endlessly about who deserves what, but none will dispute whether each should receive his due. The law must blind itself to everything but the merits of the case, and nothing should hamper our efforts to see the world as it really is. The sacred mission of science, then, is to glorify the truth, and in so doing to elevate humanity. Such high responsibility demands impassioned dedi- cation, not cold detachment. It follows that human beings are not worthy of passing ultimate judg- ment upon a scientist's work. The truth does not reside in the opinions of men. We rejoice in Galileo's vindication because it damns an illegiti- mate tribunal. Whether our case be right or wrong, we can and must plead it before a higher court. Therefore, although a scientist communi- cates with his fellow men, and recognizes them as legitimate auditors, he does not address them. Rather his writings are directed toward an ideal reader, one whom mortals strive to emulate. Great science, like great art, should erect a monument to its creator, before which men will for- ever stand in awe. Its literary expression must conform to the dignity of its office, while yet retaining a just indication of its authorship. Style demands that the artist not intrude too much into his work, but if his presence goes unfelt, the work becomes insipid. A stylistic conflict arises when we confuse the different stages of research and assimilation. The place for rigor and detachment is in making the decision as to what is true. Here the logic should be clear, and the facts should speak plainly. Yet too much emphasis gets placed upon efforts to test and to persuade, to the detriment of discovery and understanding. Demonstrative discourse can be impressive, but it is a straightforward matter of following the rules of logic. On the other hand, innovation par- takes of so much apparent mystery that it seems to obey no rules. One need hardly wonder that the generation of novelty and its vindication through experiential tests are the main satisfactions of research. Yet remarkably little of the excitement of discovery comes through when an author deals solely with verification. The conventions of scientific writing leave that out, and these days such matters are supposed to be relegated to one's memoirs. Better authors do nonetheless manage to leave a few hints of how it all was done, and a knowing and empathetic reader may be able to re-create the living thought for himself. Historians and critics of science ought to help bridge this gap between the research paper and the laboratory, and a few succeed in doing so. We forget the vanity and transitoriness of persuasion. Fame has little to do with greatness, consensus still less with truth. A good reader furthermore would rather not have his mind made up for him. He wants matters explained, so that he can decide for himself, on the basis of what he knows, as well as what he is told. If the reader understands the writer's message, nothing else matters. Hence the writer is justified in employing whatever resources of language can accomplish that end. This position clashes strongly with some attitudes that are widely ac- cepted concerning rhetoric in science. Traditional philosophy of science</page><page sequence="3">POETIC BIOLOGY 495 has tended to favor detachment and abstraction in language. Stressing verification, and virtually identifying thought with language, it has ill sympathized with poetic modes of expression. Metaphors especially, ac- cording to such views, must be purged from a scientist's lexicon, for by definition they are illegitimate uses of words and must be a source of error. Analogy too is considered suspect for the same basic reason. Even the comparison of one concrete being to another gives rise to suspicions that some kind of analogical fallacy has been perpetrated, and the ideal theory is supposed to be a mathematical model. Yet from the points of view of discovery and of understanding, analogy and metaphor provide the best way of transcending the limitations of ordinary thought and of ordinary language. That such is the case has long been recognized. Thus Aristotle writes in a celebrated passage: "But the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor. It is the one thing that cannot be learnt from others; and it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars."3 The notion that abstraction is necessarily a good thing can be challenged upon biological grounds. Our brain was not put together by some phi- losopher-deity as an instrument for dealing with arcane hypotheses or for apprehending the truth pure and simple. Rather it arose because it helped our ancestors, generation after generation, to cope with the problems of their everyday lives-with concrete objects and with other organisms of the same species and of different ones. It is a means of helping us to know the truth only insofar as knowing the truth helps us to survive and reproduce. The human brain can indeed rise to most impressive levels of abstraction, and it can transport itself to fields of endeavor far removed from ordinary experience. But it cannot walk upon the water; it has to take a roundabout excursion via the solid ground of familiar knowledge. This biological constraint imposes distinct limitations upon the route which we must take in our explorations.4 We think best when we reason about concrete particulars. Doing so helps us to get hold of what we are thinking about and provides a solid basis should we wish to move on. In all our discourse the reason for such concreteness is the same. A good novelist renders his insights, he does not expound them. His ability to do so convincingly provides one just criterion of his excellence. For many of us, at least, imaginative literature tells us more about human behavior than psychology does. And even in psychology itself, the same principle applies. Case histories and experi- ments satisfy us far more than do purely theoretical disquisitions. When we deal with unfamiliar materials it helps to draw analogies and make comparisons with something that we can already handle. Dar- win's approach provides some gocd examples of how this facilitates both discovery and communication.5 His most significant innovation occurred when he realized the effects of competition among natural populations of animals and plants. It has never been easy for biologists to think about</page><page sequence="4">496 NEW LITERARY HISTORY competition in the wild; however, we have a fair idea of how people com- pete. Hence it is no mere curiosity that the major breakthrough occurred when Darwin read a book on classical economics by Malthus. Similarly, it was commonplace knowledge-in his day perhaps more than ours- that breeders can alter domesticated organisms by "selection." They could choose whatever kind of animal or plant they wanted, breed from that stock, and produce the desired change. He realized that a similar process going on under natural conditions, with the contingencies of the habitat determining which individual organisms would survive and re- produce, could have the same effect. He called the analogous process "natural selection." The comparison lent great plausibility to his argu- ment. On the other hand, his hostile critics, past and present, have seized upon this and certain other metaphors as an excuse for condemning his theories. Of course there is no being called Nature, identical to a breeder who exercises a choice. His opponents unfairly accused him of false analogy, for Darwin never claimed that such a being exists. A sympa- thetic reader finds the comparison enlightening and the metaphor apt. Our metaphors do not delude us when we acknowledge them as such. Analogical fallacy too can be avoided through taking proper care. Un- fortunately the analogical mode of reasoning is so habitual to our think- ing that we rarely attend to its use. Whether by heredity or by learning, our thought processes have become adapted largely to dealing with people, We empathize. We put ourselves in one another's place. We ask how others must feel about this or that. It seems perfectly sensible to extend such practices to other species, or even to inanimate objects. We "know" at a certain level that in kicking the chair that has bruised us we are not getting even, but we feel better anyway. We relate to dogs by treating them as if they were people, much as our dogs treat us like members of their own species. Such anthropomorphism works, but not when carried to excess. Two social mammals ought to have much, albeit not every- thing, in common. On the other hand, we go far astray when we pre- suppose such similarities in birds or insects. All this tends to indicate that much of our thought about the rest of the universe is "modeled" upon our thought concerning man and his society. When we realize what we are doing, it becomes fairly obvious that a certain kind of comparison is being made; but our awareness of how we think has always been quite limited. In the historical develop- ment of scientific language and metaphysics, one should be able to detect a gradual movement away from crude anthropomorphism, but nonetheless it should always remain somewhat of a problem. Realizing our mistakes takes time, but avoiding them altogether seems humanly impossible. We should have to restructure not only our habits, but our very brains. Con- sider the expression "law of nature." Immediately we may find ourselves conjoining two anthropomorphisms. The idea of a law suggests the tra- ditional view of a similarity between laws of nature and those governing societies. Descartes even went as far as to claim that the laws of mathe- matics had been legislated by God, as a king ordains laws in his realm.6</page><page sequence="5">POETIC BIOLOGY 497 Nature herself, as already mentioned, becomes personified. She turns into a goddess who acts, and who acts in a morally desirable way. Few would go as far as William Harvey and say that "Nature does nothing in vain." But the notions that we should not tamper with "Nature" and that she will always do the right thing remain as much a part of pop ecology as they do of conservative Christian theology and ethics. On the other hand, one would think that an appropriate choice of comparisons, symbols, analogies, names, and the like would greatly facil- itate communication among scientists. If the principles suggested above are correct, we ought to find good scientific writing gaining vividness and force through metaphors and analogies-perhaps ones drawn from our everyday lives. The following examples illustrate this possibility. A major branch of biology, systematics, is concerned with arranging organisms in classification schemes and with giving names to groups of them. A highly developed theoretical discipline, taxonomy, deals with the canons and principles involved. As biological classification and nam- ing have received a great deal of attention, this branch of biology is per- haps the one best understood with respect to what may be called the literary aspect of the subject. It makes great practical difference how one forms a classification system and what names one attaches to the groups. A classification can be merely a convenient storage device, like a tele- phone book. Or, like a roadmap, it can provide a general overview of a subject, summarizing important facts without dragging in trivia or over- burdening the memory. Names can be merely arbitrary, as when moun- tains are named in honor of some person; or they may contain a useful descriptive element, such as the shape of the object. Naturally, as con- ceptions of the universe evolve, different modes of arranging natural objects will be preferred and different labels might be applied. The more fundamental principles should remain unaltered, however, at least insofar as they embody unchanging truths about the psychology of language and of thought. The oldest biological classification system known to us is found in Aristotle's History of Animals. Here he arranged beings in a series from lower to higher, in a way that fitted in admirably with his conception of the universe as a whole. He conceived of a scala naturae-a ladder of nature-which gave a single series, from mere stuff, to nutritive plants, to sensitive animals, to men, and finally to divine beings.7 One can detect an underlying theme of Greek ethnocentric intellectualism running through the entire system. Man, of course, is the highest of terrestrial beings, and his happiness consists in contemplating the eternal and the divine. God thinks only about himself. It was not unlike the kind of subordination which existed in Greek society. Aristotle recognized various kinds of animals, but for the most part he used terms drawn from every- day language instead of coining a technical vocabulary. He had far more respect, it would seem, for natural language than do modern philosophers and scientists. Primitive men have habitually viewed language as an</page><page sequence="6">498 NEW LITERARY HISTORY awesome mystery and a divine gift; our critical attitude toward it devel- oped much later and quite gradually. Our modem form of biological classification owes most to the labors of one man, Linnaeus (Carl von Linne, 1707-78). His contribution lay not so much with his originality, but with his sensibility. He took the Aristotelian philosophy over from the Christian tradition and strove to develop and express a cosmography. His numinous world needed to be classified and its constituents named, in order that man might appreciate it. Man was, Linnaeus said, a guest in the palace of the Lord Almighty, a guest who ought to express his gratitude for such hospitality by admir- ing the property of his host. If Linnaeus did little more than organize the traditional scala naturae, nonetheless he presented it in such striking form that it took on a sense of vitality and grandeur of a new order. And it is in no small measure due to his analogical prowess and choice of words that he managed to carry the day. Linnaeus erected a hierarchy of levels in which the various groups of organisms were distributed and provided with a rank. He often selected names for the levels on the basis of social metaphors. Thus his Systema Naturae mirrored the order within Nature-an entity which he chose to call an empire. Nature in turn included three kingdoms: Plantae, Animalia, and Lapides. The social analogies become less apparent at lower levels, and he shifted reference at will. He might switch to military terms, so that within the orders "genera are marshalled as in a phalanx."8 Likewise, he remarks "let every species of plant bear on its standard the name of the genus which marks the regiment in which it serves."9 Linnaeus invented a so-called "artificial system" for flowering plants based upon their sexual characteristics. It was "artificial" in the sense of obtaining convenience in identification at the price of an arbitrary ar- rangement. One need only determine the number and arrangement of male and female parts (stamens and pistils) to find the name of a plant. It had the additional advantage of striking and memorable names for the various sexual assemblages. For example, one kind of plant might be "dioecious"-built according to the "two house plan." Here there were separate plants, some with only male flowers, others with only female flowers. According to the "one house plan" ("monoecy"), there was only one kind of plant (house), but there were purely male and purely female flowers-as he put it, the males and females occupy different beds. In "hermaphrodites," each flower would contain both male and female parts, hence occupy the same bed. Linnaeus' system became very popular. Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) even wrote a long poem with notes, The Loves of the Plants, elaborating upon it.1o The system passed into oblivion because it served mainly as an aid to identification and failed to put many closely similar plants together. One might wonder if its vogue and its rejection had something to do with prudery or its antithesis, and whether Linnaeus had a "dirty mind." The best answer would seem to be that some people were out- raged: God would never allow such a flagrant show of immodesty.</page><page sequence="7">POETIC BIOLOGY 499 Linnaeus' piety, however, would have disposed him to see nothing wrong in a world abounding in so rich a diversity of marital customs. In fact, the sexual metaphors were devised in accordance with Lin- naeus' canons of naming, which were quite elaborate. The terms, he thought, should be striking, easily understood, and readily impressed upon "the tablets of the memory." As he puts it, "any comparison used in a specific epithet shall be as plain as a pike-staff, even if the result is not very pleasing."'11 He wished to avoid subtle ironies and unnecessary metaphor-preferring "red" to "bloody," for instance.12 But resemblances to common objects he considered highly desirable, for these were any- thing but obscure. A common fungus, the "stinkhorn," which Bauhin had referred to as "Fungus foetidus penis imaginem referens," Linnaeus called Phallus impudicus.3s It was as gross-looking an organism as his Aphrodite, a hairy worm sometimes called the "sea-mouse." These names and others like them are remembered with little effort. That was the visceral reason for much of his choice of names, and indeed for the structure of his entire system. The hierarchy of groups within groups allows one to generalize on the basis of a few general terms. Likewise, he adopted a "binomial" system linking the name of the genus inseparably with the name of the species; it was like brothers' having the same surname, he said. Such use of analogy and metaphor produced effective and economical communication and thought. It can be contrasted with the excesses of certain romantic biologists. Instead of viewing the world as a palace to be admired, they considered it a mystical document to be deciphered. Much given to Platonism, such men as Oken, Swainson, and MacLeay saw it their duty to find out what God was trying to tell us through the Creation. The message was read by the application of numerology and the perception of symbols. Where Linnaeus had counted pistils and stamens as a means of arranging his materials for convenient identifica- tion, Oken sought to find groups of parts in threes, fives, and sevens. In his Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie, he retained the scala naturae with a curious twist, one which we moderns may view with some dismay: he put the arts and sciences at the top of the ladder, with the art of war ranked highest of all.14 Others of like outlook searched for that perfect figure the circle. For MacLeay and his followers, everything had to be arranged in circles of five groups, although, as he tells us, "the number seven might also perhaps, for obvious reasons, occur to the mind, were it allowable in natural history to ground any reasoning except upon facts of organiza- tion."15 Each group of five would have symbolic correspondences to other groups. Thus a group of carnivorous beetles would be analogous to sharks, to tigers, and to a given human temperament. There had to be five biogeographic provinces, five races of man, and five of just about everything. Romantic biology, as one might expect, soon exhausted itself and stimulated an empiricist, antispeculative reaction. Much debate among early nineteenth-century biologists had to do with the issue of whether there really exists a single and unbroken chain of organisms, from lower to higher, as represented by the traditional scala</page><page sequence="8">500 NEW LITERARY HISTORY naturae. The early evolutionists tended to favor the view that it does exist, while creationists affirmed or denied it, according to their diverse outlooks. Baron Cuvier (1769-1839), one of the greatest creationists, thought that there are four major groups of animals, none of which can be derived from any other. His contemporary Lamarck (1744-1822), the outstanding evolutionist before Darwin, denied that he had merely restated the scala naturae and given it an historical interpretation.16 Yet if one examines his classifications, it becomes apparent that Lamarck had only partly modified the notion of a ladder. He believed in separate origins for animals and plants, while both groups ascended toward higher levels in a generally linear path. Within the animal series itself, he admitted side branches, but he did so without abandoning the notion of a single series leading upward toward man. His ladder had become somewhat more like a trellis, with one main, upward-directed axis, and a series of branches leading off to each side. It remained for Charles Darwin (1809-82) and his followers to abandon the old metaphor for a new one and to replace the ladder of nature with a tree of descent. In the first edition of The Origin of Species, Darwin represented evolution in the form of a branching diagram indicat- ing gradual diversification among numerous independent lineages. The notion of organisms' improving was de-emphasized in favor of their be- coming different and filling a variety of places in the natural economy. He considered proper classification to be "genealogical"17 and compared a system of this kind to a pedigree.18 To Darwin's enthusiastic German supporter, Ernst Haeckel (1834- 1919), we may attribute the vogue of drawing "phylogenetic trees" as representations of such genealogies. Haeckel was an artist whose scientific drawings often took on a surrealist character. The trees he drew for his Generelle Morphologie of 1866 look very much like bushes and trees, with thick trunks and gnarled, knotty branches.19 Without leaves and pro- jected on a single plane, they call to mind the artificiality and lifelessness of espaliered plants in a winter garden. Roots are not shown, so the metaphor seems imperfect, and the critic is free to remark that the tree rests upon nothing but speculation. The search for vividness had gone too far. Evolutionists continue to draw treelike diagrams, but they render them in much less overtly botanical form. They need not stress the similarity, for the point has been made, and evolutionary classification has become an established part of everyday work. To call such diagrams "trees" seems hardly metaphorical anymore, but the metaphor is not dead, as may be seen from the fact that biologists often put quotation marks around the word tree. Rather the metaphor has become habitual, so much so that we do not bother to reflect about it. Even today systematic biologists seem not quite sure whether their field is a science or an art. So much gets decided on the basis of opinion that many argue in favor of reforms which supposedly would render it less conventional and hence supposedly more "scientific." They want a set of mechanical rules, ones which would generate classification systems</page><page sequence="9">POETIC BIOLOGY 50 once the data are at hand. Others insist upon allowing a certain flexi- bility, so that the classifier can opt for what he considers the best of a variety of possible systems, and do so on the basis of taste. Yet one might argue whether this is really a question of science versus art. Artists, too, must operate within one set of limitations or another. They have to accept the physical properties of their medium, and they embrace canons of perspective and harmony. There are good and bad rules, and the question is not a matter of the difference between science and art, but whether the rules, wherever applied, will do good or ill. Some have maintained that science differs from art insofar as scientific discovery partakes of an inevitability which is lacking in the arts. This inevitability is thought to result from the objective reference and public nature of scientific knowledge. The argument goes that should one scientist fail to discover a theory or fact, another will succeed in due course, but a novel that never gets written is lost forever. One might be tempted to respond that the difference is a matter of degree, and that similar novels do get written. But this is a forced argument and quite superfluous, for the alleged difference results from the wrong entities being compared. A discovery is not equivalent to a novel. Anna Karenina should be compared to De Motu Cordis, not to the circulation of the blood. If we are to find discoveries in the humanities we should look to styles, techniques, and forms-such as the novel or the short story-which need not be developed by a particular individual. The fact that a scientist's contribution may include certain elements that are, so to speak, public matters does not render his work impersonal. A scientist does more than just unearth facts and hypotheses. He sees what they mean and does something with them. What he does is by no means inevitable, but rather is the product of circumstances and per- sonality. Alfred Russel Wallace discovered natural selection indepen- dently of Charles Darwin, but he could never have written The Origin of Species, any more than Dante could have written Hamlet. Linnaeus has had imitators and followers, and taxonomy would very likely have evolved in the same direction had he never lived. On the other hand the probability must be dismissed as trivial that anybody else could have suffused a Systema Naturae with such cosmic vision. Later efforts to classify upon grand scale-those of Lamarck and Cuvier, for instance-must be admired, too, but for different reasons. In each case the system embodies a characteristic point of view, and each is as much the product of a unique individual as any painting or symphony. Darwin, at the height of his intellectual prowess, and in the middle of his evolu- tionary research, spent eight years classifying the barnacles. Although his monograph advanced the subject as never before or since, there seems little doubt that, ultimately, others would have done the work. Yet they could hardly have demonstrated, in his magisterial style, the utility of evolutionary insight in practical systematics. Haeckel's phylogenetic trees, or something like them, could have been drawn by all sorts of people, but not in the same context. He was leading the fight for evolution at a</page><page sequence="10">502 NEW LITERARY HISTORY particular time and place, and his diagrams were marshaled in support of his cause. Like the rest of us, he had to do more than succeed in the laboratory and the field. The situation demanded literature and graphic art. Style has to be adapted to contingencies of environment that never recur. For that reason a given work can only be produced at one par- ticular time. On the basis of observations such as these, one gets the impression that aesthetics plays a far more important and legitimate role in the lives of scientists than some would have us think. Furthermore, the continued investigation of such matters might tell us much about thinking in all realms of experience. Yet the history and philosophy of science in their current forms have directed most of their attention elsewhere, so that we cannot say much about other work along the same lines. The various philosophical schools, even the logical positivists, have preferred to keep the dark closets of our intellects locked up. Despite the diversity of opinion, Occidental philosophy retains its traditional outlook. It seeks to dominate and schematize nature, rather than to live with it. With certain noteworthy exceptions (such as Heraclitus), Western philosophers have focused upon product rather than process. They have concerned themselves with ideas rather than with thinking, and with words rather than with meaning. A striking contrast emerges when we compare certain oriental positions on such matters. The Neoplatonist point of view is well expressed in the biblical aphorism "In the beginning was the word." Lao-Tzu (or whoever really wrote that part of the Tao Te Ching) on the contrary insists that the Tao is prior to all else and that knowledge of it cannot be expressed in words. The thirteenth book of the Chuang-Tzu deals with the same issue by dismissing words as the corpses of thought. To some this may appear rather too hyperbolic, but it all depends upon one's point of view. An entomologist's study collection may consist of tray upon tray of dried bugs and Coleoptera, all neatly pinned and labeled. He may use the collection as an indirect means of understanding how insects live. On the other hand he may treat the collection as an end in itself, so that his task is complete when the corpses have been placed in order, like with like. Orthodox philosophy of science, too, has its archives of formalized schemes, with symbols ranked page after page like so many insects pinned. But the entomologists are far more lively than the philosophers of science. Entomologists are supposed to do field work and observe the living insects in their laboratories. Nothing analogous is expected of philosophers of science. Perhaps theirs is a branch of learning in which necromancy has not yet been dismissed as a superstition. The history of science, too, displays more signs of decay than of vitality. The antiquarian's outlook almost inevitably gives rise to a desiccated, mummified preparation, indicative perhaps of structure but inadequate as a guide to function. Indeed, many historians of science are mere philistines, uninterested in science and hostile to scientists. They take an "externalist" approach and study the background to science, rather than</page><page sequence="11">POETIC BIOLOGY 503 science itself. The resulting product reeks with gossip, sneers, trivialities, and sociopolitical diatribe. We are presented with not even a corpse, but only shrouds and coffins. To take the place of such lore, we need a branch of literary criticism devoted to science. Its goal would be the same as that of criticism in the arts: to help us understand and appreciate the work. It could employ the analytical techniques of philosophy and seek philosophical insight, without having to concern itself with the tastes of academic philosophers. A form of literary history which rendered the classics more readily intel- ligible might appeal to an audience to whom the history of science offers nothing. Such critical literature already exists, but it has not been recognized for what it is. It even lacks a name. Philosophers and historians of science disown it, as well they may. Entombed within the walls of their own disciplines, they need not justify themselves before the outside world. They may choose to parade their work, zombie-like, about the market- place of ideas, but we may question whether it would look very attractive when exposed to the light. One hopes that they will remain where they are, enjoying, as Schopenhauer put it, their sleep without dreams, and leave the business of explaining science to those who take an interest in it.* BODEGA MARINE LABORATORY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NOTES 1 Brewster Ghiselin, "Creativity in the Arts and Sciences: The Basic Parallels," The Michigan Quarterly Review, 13 (1974), 93-98. 2 M.
