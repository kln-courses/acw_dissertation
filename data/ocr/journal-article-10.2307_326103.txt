<plain_text><page sequence="1">text is evident in both the format and pedagogical meth- ods used in the Spanish text. The first section of the text consists of two parts: observaciones gramaticales and ob- servaciones lixicas; and the second section contains ejer- cicios de gramdtica and ejercicios de traduccidn. Although the author assumes that students will have already mastered the fundamental concepts of Spanish grammar, a concise summary of problems most likely to be encountered in translation appears in the observa- ciones gramaticales. The topics considered in this part are the gender of nouns, the pronoun se, ser and estar, past tenses, the subjunctive, correspondence of tenses, the ger- und, por and para, and verbs followed by prepositions. Numerous examples of translations from Spanish to En- glish of both isolated sentences as well as sentences within the context of a paragraph eliminate much of the difficulty frequently experienced by students in under- standing grammatical explanations in Spanish. The ejer- cicios de gramdtica in the second part are translation ex- ercises dealing with all of the topics in the observaciones gramaticales except past tenses which are treated in more lengthy passages in the ejercicios de traduccidn. Space is provided for a student to write his own translation of a given sentence prior to comparing the result with the translation given on the following page. It is noted that the solution provided is "muy discutible en muchos casos" and by no means should be considered always the only correct translation. Whenever more difficult points of grammar may require further explanation, references are given to specific passages of the Curso superior de sintaxis espaiola by Samuel Gili Gaya. The part called observaciones ldxicas is an alphabetical listing and analysis of sixty-seven expressions frequently improperly translated into Spanish by native speakers of English. The ejercicios de traduccidn are selections from works by Bernard Taper, Mark Twain, Christopher Davis, Al- dous Huxley, Graham Green, and Camilo Jose Cela. In the case of the selection by Cela, the model "translation" is the original Spanish version. The Manual de composicion espaiola provides a thor- oughly adequate review of grammar without sacrificing the spontaneity of everyday language. FLEMING G. VINSON Western Carolina University RIVERS, ELIAS L. (translator). Ddmaso Alonso: Hijos de la ira. Children of Wrath. A bilingual edition. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1970. Pp. xiv + 170. $6.95. There is no question of Damaso Alonso's stature as a scholar: he is the most important Spanish literary critic of our time. His immensely valuable studies of G6ngora, San Juan de la Cruz, Garcilaso and others are without peer; they have transformed Spanish literary scholarship and history, and have left a deep mark on the creative writers, especially poets, of before and after the war. His reputation as a poet rests primarily on this volume, Hijos de la ira, which appeared in 1944 and has now been ex- pertly translated by Elias Rivers. Hijos de la ira stands in dose relationship to the tremendista novels of the post- reading, and writing, more commonly called the "audio- lingual" method (p. vi). The authors prefer to call this method the "fundamental skills method." Included in their survey are the various approaches that have been used throughout the history of foreign language teaching in the United States. Chapters Two and Three examine how the findings of linguists can be applied in the classroom to improve teaching methods and illustrate in great detail the procedures and techniques involved in presenting and teaching audio-lingual materials. Chapter Four is con- cerned with the significant sound contrasts of English and Spanish and how to teach pronounciation. The pur- pose and construction of pattern drills and how they can be used is discussed in chapter five. The various types of syntactic drills are presented and organized t6 show which drills are best suited to a particular structural problem. It is interesting to note that even though the authors do not recommend the translation drill (teacher gives English cue, students supply the Spanish equiva- lent), they do include examples of the translation drill in their samples of syntactic drills (pp. 78-79). Chapter Six discusses the language laboratory, its purpose, and how it should be used. A detailed account of how to teach read- ing and writing in the audio-lingual approach is pre- sented in Chapter Seven. Chapter Eight discusses testing and includes examples of items for testing listening and speaking skills, grammatical structures, vocabulary and idioms, reading, writing, and cultural information. Meth- ods of scoring, item analysis and statistical evaluation are also briefly discussed. The remaining chapters are con- cerned with the selection and adaptation of textbooks (including a list of criteria for textbook evaluation), the teaching of culture, vocabulary building, and the plan- ning for a 4-6 year sequence in the language. Professors Feldman and Kline have indeed consistently emphasized the practical throughout their book and I would highly recommend it for use in a methods course on the teaching of Spanish, provided that the prospective teachers have already had courses in the contrastive anal- ysis of Spanish and English and in Spanish phonetics.

The Manual de composicidn espaiola is a workbook for composition designed to help students avoid the more frequent errors of translating from English into Spanish. Since it is assumed that students will have already mas- tered the fundamental concepts of Spanish grammar, the text would most likely be used during the third year on the secondary school level or in an advanced course in composition during the fourth semester on the university level. Professor Gonzalez Muela states in the Introduction that the Manual de composicion espanola was written following the precedent of the Handbook for French Composition by Donald Stone, Jr., published by Pren- tice-Hall (2nd edition 1969). The influence of the latter REVIEWS 105</page><page sequence="2">war period, like Pascual Duarte and Nada. The same an- guish, despair, hopelessness and implied social criticism reflected in the novels form the substance of this book of poems. Therein lies its great value: it opened the path for the poetry of social protest that appeared in the fif- ties (Otero, Celaya, Hierro) and it dispensed, once and for all, with "poetic" language as such, in a style reminis- cent of Neruda's Residencia en tierra. Concern with form and metaphor were put aside: A veces en la noche yo me revuelvo y me incorporo en este nicho en el que hace 45 afios me pudro, ("Insomnio," p. 2) Instead, he sought a straightforward, almost prosaic state- ment, a testimony to the decay he felt within himself and in his environment. For this reader, however, Alonso cannot be reckoned among the great poets of '27, or of '36; he is a good minor poet who performed a useful and valuable service, a clearing away of literary debris and an attempt to look candorously at his country and himself at that juncture of history. Aside from three or four inspired and success- ful poems like "Insomnio" and "Voz de arbol," much of his poetry strikes me as being overly rhetorical, with a rather romantic tendency toward repetition: iOh!: noches y dias, dias y noches, noches y dias, dias y noches, y muchos, muchos dias, y muchas, muchas noches. ("Mujer con alcuza," p. 56) It may be unfair to quote out of context, but these lines have for me the distinction of being some of the worst published en lo que va del siglo. And I find an- noying the rather silly anthropomorphism of poems like "Elegia a un moscard6n azul" (p. 68) in which he la- ments the sudden and violent death of a Blue-bottle fly: Estabas en mi casa, mirabas mi jardin, eras muy bello. Yo te mate. IOh si pudiera ahora darte otra vez la vida, yo que te di la muertel But there are also beautifully executed, important poems like "Injusticia" (p. 4) and "Dolor" (p. 103). The book is uneven, but it has much merit. Rereading it was a painful experience, because the misery it relates is only too familiar. The religious experience it tries to convey is barely communicated to this reader, and the repetition of "iSefior!" calls to mind, unfortunately, much falsely "confessional" poetry of the post-war period. (Like all judgments of modern poetry, this one is purely subjec- tive; others obviously have a much more positive view of Damaso Alonso as a creative artist.) I have only praise for Professor Rivers' translation. He nearly always finds the exact word and expression in English, and he beautifully captures both the spirit and the letter of the original. He has the sensitivity and style of a poet; indeed, one at times has the feeling that his version is better than the original: And it comes and goes, the stealthy swift flow of the blood, and the most secret spring comes and goes, bringing intimate music, mysterious signals conjured up by instinct, and they with avid sucking, more and more avid, drink in life, which is still only moonlight upon an unknown village submerged in sleep, and they feel obscurely that they are a bit of warmth, a palpitation ... ("A la Virgen Maria," p. 151) The book probably would have benefited from inter- pretive notes. The remarkable obscurity of some of the poems demands some help for the reader. What of the persona, the "I" of the poems: do they refer to the his- torical personage, Damaso Alonso, or do they conjure up a mask created by the poet? Andrew Debicki, in a recent study of Alonso, throws considerable light on this prob- lem. The suffering and the religious yearning appear, at first glance, to be a subjective cry of the individual; but the work becomes richer and more universal if, like De- bicki, in Damaso Alonso we consider it in a larger con- text: "In the light of the themes of the conflict of view- points and of selflessness as a means of elevation, the speaker of the 'confessional' poems is above all a symbol for the human being who has to find his way and tran- scend his limitations, and not a portrait of Mr. Damaso Alonso." (p. 54). Although Mr. Rivers recognizes this problem by referring to the "protagonist" of the poems, his excellent introduction may have dwelt more on such matters of interpretation.

This new reader is intended by its authors to supple- ment a first year French grammar while offering the stu- dent an introduction to literature. Composed of thirty selections drawn mostly from the twentieth century, it is arranged in order of ascending difficulty with passages varying in length from a few lines to more than a dozen pages. Each is followed by: 1) grammatical exercises (such as changing all verbs from the present to the past), 2) simple questions about the passage read, 3) more sub- tle questions chosen to underline the artistic aspects of the selection, and 4) a subject for composition. The ma- terial has been tested in the classroom where it proved to be, according to the authors, "eminently successful." As an instrument for the study of the language, this book is not without merit. The first selections are suf- ficiently simple (or sufficiently footnoted) to permit utili- zation early in the year; the exercises are varied and adequate. In both these respects it is preferable to the 106 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
