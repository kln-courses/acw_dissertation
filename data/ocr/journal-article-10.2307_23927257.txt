<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading the Bible as Literature: An Introduction. By Jeanie C. Crain. Cambridge: Polity Press, 2010. viii + 213 pp. £16.99 (pbk). Different lines of approach to biblical interpretation are still a matter of great dis cussion. Is the Bible to be treated as a sacred and authoritative theological Word? Or as a significant example of Weltliteratur? A potent cultural or even nationalist object? Or, after the Higher Criticism, simply a historically fragmented patchwork of texts? These questions, and many others, continue to animate and circle the sometime meetings and partings between biblical studies, theology, literary theory and cultural criticism. Jeanie C. Crain's Reading the Bible as Literature: An Introduction is a useful starting point to begin to explore some of these questions, but it is very much only a starting point. Crain's focus is on introducing the study of the Bible as literature in itself. This is significant as the aim of the book is not to link the Bible with other literatures or cultural artefacts, or to utilise literature as an active space within which to engage the biblical material; treating the Bible as a piece of literature means that reading it as such involves learning the tools of the trade. This book offers a basic toolkit. Chapter One presents an overview of what 'Bible as Literature' might mean and what this perspec tive offers, especially within the constitutional politics of an American classroom where the 'Bible as Literature' approach attempts to bracket religious or theological concerns, treating the Bible as 'a framework for Western literature' (p. 13). Although this immediately raises many questions and continues to do so throughout (even though these questions are not fully addressed), the emphasis on pedagogical issues is apt for a book that is designed for the student beginner in the field. After the scene has been set, the rest of the seven chapters progress rapidly, intro ducing, in Crain's terms, 'ways' of'using language', 'meaning', 'seeing', 'clarifying and mapping', 'identifying', and 'unifying', reading a good number of biblical texts on the way. Thus, Chapter Two explores 'Style, Tone and Rhetorical Strategy' (a sampling of rhetorical devices); Chapter Three focuses on 'Image, Metaphor, Symbol and Archetype' ('unifying' images such as light, darkness, water; reading different meta phors of Divine-Human relationship); Chapter Four outlines 'Major Genres' (narra tive, drama, poetry); Chapter Five introduces 'Sub-Genres' (song, allegory, parable, prayer); Chapter Six highlights 'Characters' (methods of characterisation through, for example, King Saul and the Witch of Endor, Kingjosiah and Huldah); and Chapter Seven emphasises 'Themes and Motifs' (The Shema, different forms of the Covenant, the heroic quest). If this seems formulaic, it is, but Crain covers a lot of important ground and makes sure that the emphasis is on reading a wide variety of biblical texts and taking the student slowly through each aspect. This guidance takes the form of introducing each chapter with a bullet-point outline of what will be covered,</page><page sequence="2">ii4 BOOK REVIEWS followed by an italicised section that introduces the main issues of the chapter and discusses what the student is expected to leam by chapter's end. In-text, specific terms are highlighted, directing the student to the extensive and useful glossary. Each chap ter is then concluded with some good close reading exercises and some broader questions for reflection. Although it has some strong points, I am not entirely convinced with this peda gogical style; in some instances, it can feel heavy handed and intrusive in the student's own learning processes. Some sections give an overly brief example of the topic under discussion (e.g. Personification, Metonymy, and Synecdoche or Anthropomorphism and Zoomorphism, pp. 28, 29) and then quickly go into italics again as the author signals what is coming next, immediately before its arrival. This signposting can sometimes seem rigid and inflexible. However, Crain does emphasise that this is an introduction and that 'textbooks usually serve as guides' (p. 1, italics in text). This guide has compass finnly in hand and can inspire those following along behind to negotiate the literary and biblical terrain effectively and safely. It is important to bear in mind that this style might not suit every student's development; in fact, some may rebel productively against it. The fact that there is no bibliography in Reading the Bible as Literature makes it more difficult to get a handle on the secondary material that Crain covers. To help with this there is the added teaching tool of online support. This includes 23 pages of tables and figures illustrating, for example, the Documentary hypothesis, the ordering of the biblical canon in different traditions, approximate datings of biblical books and so on, although it could be argued that much of this material serves as an introduction to biblical studies, rather than expanding on literary approaches. The web site also publishes extended versions of the chapter notes which, to my mind, are important to flag to students; the notes offer much more awareness of the theoretical issues and nuances involved in using tenns such as reading, interpretation, authorship, meaning, canon; in short, offering a more complex sense of what might be at stake in treating the Bible as literature. Perhaps these notes are excluded simply due to lack of space, and their full inclusion might well interrupt some of the pedagogical signposting, but it would be extremely important for any student using this textbook to explore the web site and to gain a fuller understanding of the copious literature that covers this topic from a variety of angles. This review has focussed mainly on the pedagogical aspects of Reading the Bible as Literature: An Introduction as this is Crain's stated remit. Serving as an introduction, I should not be too critical of the lack of interest in going 'off-piste' and tackling some of the thornier questions of'reading the Bible' opened by ideological criticism, gender theories, new-historicism, secular studies and so on, even though these have been circling Bible for some time now. Crain offers a useful guidebook that underpins the now classic 'Bible as Literature' formulation that 'the Bible must be rescued from theology, abstraction and propositions; it must also be rescued from scholars - both the conservative scholar, who organizes it into theological outlines and proof-texts, and the scholar who traces the text from its original to its existing state' (p. 12). The synopsis on the book's back cover takes this one step further, stating that 'above all' this rescue attempt seeks 'to return the Bible to the common reader'. I would hope that this guidebook can also, along with the influence of other guides, offer exactly the opposite—introductory tools to aid the beginning student in undemanding that</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 115 the Bible has been widely, multi-dimensionally and uncommonly read and that many of its texts are extremely difficult to map onto the given sense of 'literature' as is assumed here. doi:io.i093/litthe/frqo62 Samuel tongue Advance Access publication 20 December 2010 University of Glasgow SAMUEL TONGUE</page></plain_text>
