<plain_text><page sequence="1">Symmetry in Twentieth-Century Harmony by Robert C. Ehle Dr. Ehle is associate director of the School of Music , Univer- sity of Northern Colorado at Greeley. The present article is part of his continuing series informally called " Ideas in Composi- tion and Theory. " Possibly is the search the most for pressing a scheme concern of analysis for music and categorization theory today is the search for a scheme of analysis and categorization of 20th-century music that is in any sense comprehensive. The problem is based on the knowledge that such a comprehen- sive scheme exists for nearly all of the music written between 1600 and 1900, that is, the scheme known as functional har- monic tonality. Innumerable books have been written to describe and develop the concepts of functional harmonic tonality, and this subject has been recognized as one of the major intellec- tural disciplines of the Western world. A similar comprehensive scheme exists for the music of the Renaissance. Known as modal counterpoint, the discipline of 16th-century counterpoint is, as is well known, an organizing concept for that music. The problems might not exist if it were generally acknowl- edged that 20th-century music is of a totally experimental nature, or that it has no intrinsic value as a product but simply value as an activity. That is, if the twentieth century were to be viewed as a transitional century exclusively, then it could be justified to admit that the composers of that century tried a lot of dif- ferent ideas but that none of them proved sufficient for the crea- tion of great music. It is becoming increasingly clear that this is not the case. There is a rapidly increasing group of music lovers ready to admit that a certain cluster of 20th-century composers have created work that stands the comparison with the best of previous centuries. This cluster is widely recognized as including Stravinsky, Bartok, Hindemith, Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Vaughan Williams and several other composers. On the other hand, there is a large amount of twentieth-century music for which the verdict is not yet in. This would include most of the post-World-War-Two composers. Recognizing that we have a significant body of work of great quality and of enduring value that cannot be explained by any of the traditional methods or systems, we are faced with the problem of understanding it. Presumably some organizing force exists in the music to keep it from cacophony. Possibly a dif- ferent principle works in each of the composers' music listed above, or even in each work. Still, the great search is for a com- prehensive principle that will serve to explain all or most of this music. Such comprehensive schemes have been found in the music of past eras; it is widely hoped that such a scheme is func- tioning in the music of the present century, as well. What might such a scheme be? It would have to be more universal than the twelve-tone scheme which only works to ex- plain some aspects of some of the music by some of the com- posers mentioned. It could be a more universal scheme that in- corporates the twelve-tone idea, though, much as diatonicism is contained within functional harmonic tonality. In other word, it might be a scheme of which the twelve-tone system is a sub-set. Probably a necessary step in working out the possibilities is to consider the largest sense in which functional harmonic tonal- ity can be comprehended, and then to define that which is definitely not included. For example, major and minor diatonic systems are a part of functional harmonic tonality, but so is the mixed chromatic system of Wagner, Strauss, and modern popular music and jazz. The key to most of this music is that it is bass-oriented. The bass line is the organizing force in all of this music to the extent that we analyze it "with respect to the bass." This is true of the music of Palestrina, Bach, Wagner, Bachrach, and numerous others in between. If there is any universal organizing principle in the music of the Western world before the twentieth century, it is the organizing power of bass notes or of the bass line. This is as true of "figured bass" in Baroque composers as it is in "Walking Bass" of jazz com- posers. In the Renaissance, as well, all intervals are figured by measuring up from the sounding bass note. An added dimension was added to the power of the bass note when Rameau expounded his theory of inversion. Through the theory of inversion, two notes became co-principals in the deter- mination of the status of a harmonic aggregate or chord: the bass note and the root. The root was recognized as an ancestor of the bass note: the bass note of the chord in a more basic form. The theory of inversion added intellectual richness to the theory, but did not take away anything from the generating power of the bass note as the primary determining force in har- mony or tonality. All of this has been described countless times in in- numerable treatises and texts on counterpoint, harmony, theory and composition from the past five centuries. The point is, much of the music of Stravinsky, Bartok, Schoenberg, and the rest cannot be comprehended within this system. In many cases, the bass note is no more important in this music than any other note. We find ourselves in an idiom that is clearly not bass- oriented. What other mode of organization is possible? Melody- oriented organization is possible. That is, melody existing of and for its own sake is supported by aggregates of sounds hav- ing no structural relation to anything, but simply supporting the rhythm and texture of the piece. This has, no doubt, been done; but it would have to be recognized as an inferior com- position technique that would not produce work on the level with the best of past centuries. There comparable is, however, to the another organizing possibility principle that may of the prove past to cen- be comparable to the organizing principle of the past cen- turies. Although much remains to be explored and tested to see if this principle is as universal as earlier principles, it seems (Continued on page 12) 10 THE AMERICAN MUSIC TEACHER</page><page sequence="2">of sun and moon, night and day, light and dark, water and land, etc. At this point it is interesting to note that there are several types of symmetry. Mirror symmetry or left-right symmetry is the type found in the human body and in anthropomorphic ob- jects such as automobiles. Paired symmetry is a second type, found in identical twins, for example and in many of the dualities listed above, while a third type of symmetry is iterative symmetry in which a figure or form is repeated a number of times. This is a favorite type in the decorative arts and in ar- chitecture. A fourth is proportional symmetry. The reason why the various types of symmetry have not been strongly or widely used in music is simply that the musical system employed, in the West at any rate, is totally asy metrical and does not lend itself to the expression of symmetries. It is only in the twentieth century, with the breakdown of the traditional musical system, that the possibilities for the development of various types of symmetry became manifest. Structures that dominate traditional Western music which are inherently asymmetrical include the overtone series, the diatonic major and minor scales, the major and minor chords, as well as tonic-dominant relationships. The overtone or harmonic series is a series of decreasing in- tervals above a generating tone. There is no axis of symmetry to be found in it. The diatonic scale is symmetrical around the tone "d" or the pair of tones "g-a," but neither of these points is a primary focus in major or minor tonality. When the modes are considered, it becomes evident that some symmetries become possible: especially mirror symmetries around a pitch or pair of pitches. More than that, though, there are no two pitches in the diatonic scale from which paired symmetrical melodic structures could be built. The interval sets differs above or below each pitch. It was only with the advent of free chromaticism that it became possible to construct paired symmetrical melodies or harmonies. Major and minor chords are inherently asymmetrical, con- taining as they do one major and one minor interval. They read oppositely from the top and the bottom. The two symmetrical chords that were used in the period (only in equal temperament, though) were the diminished and augmented chords that began to have wide usage only toward the end of the nineteenth century. Among scales, the whole tone scale, the half-tone whole-tone scale and others offered possibilities of symmetrical writing. In fact, a whole cluster of "synthetic" scales were discovered that had various axes of symmetry from the Hungarian Minor of Bartok to the scales of limited transposability of Messiaen as well as, of course, the chromatic scale, probably the most sym- metrical scale of all. In line with this, the twelve-tone technique offers an inherently totally-symmetrical musical space for the composer to use - although not every composer realizes the possibilities in it. Another aspect of the traditional diatonic scale that is in- herently asymmetrical is the placement of primary tones. The dominant, for example, does not bisect the octave equally but rather produces one large segment (a fifth ) and one smaller segment (a fourth). A much more symmetrical division is that produced by the tritone or augmented fourth. This interval bisects the octave into two equal-sized segments, therefore mak- ing it possible to have two paired-symmetry sets of tones within an octave. The augmented fourth was not a common octave division in 18th- or 19th-century music, but began to find more common usage in the late nineteenth century through the medium of the diminished-seventh chord, found frequently in the music of Liszt, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner. This usage laid the founda- tion for more extensive use of that interval in the early twentieth- 12 THE AMERICAN MUSIC TEACHER distinctly possible that one principle could become a comprehen- sive scheme to explain and justify the perceived worth of a large body of highly respected twentieth-century music. This is the principle of symmetry. Symmetry as a universal, comprehensive organizing concept has to be perceived broadly and interpreted in many different senses, much as the various styles of earlier music adapted the concept of bass-orientation in many different ways: intervals above the bass, figured bass, chord roots, functional bass lines, extended chords, chromatic harmony, sequences, popular chord types, etc. The major point about symmetry as an organizing force is that the focus would be removed from the bass, and would be found in some central position with various types of symmetrical structures surrounding this point. The various sym- metrical structures may take many different forms: inversions, mirror harmony, poly-chords, poly harmony, equal-interval scales or chords, synthetic scales, sets, complementary sets or sonorities, cells, fans, geometric structures, and others fre- quently mentioned by theorists. On a rhythmic, form, or tem- poral level, symmetry can be observed in retrogrades, non- retrogradable rhythms, palindromes, arch forms and so forth. Is it possible that the principle of symmetry can be seen as a comprehensive organizing force in operation in much or most of the twentieth-century music that cannot be analyzed using the traditional bass-oriented analysis? Is it possible that this prin- ciple of symmetry is as formidable or powerful a force as the bass-organizing force? It seems distinctly possible. One of the most interesting tasks for theorists has been and continues to be the documentation of the numerous ways in which symmetry is at work in important twentieth-century compositions. To draw a clearer distinction between the two methods of organizing pitches in music, it may help to point out that bass orientation is nearly always totally asymmetrical. Everything that occurs in the music occurs above the bass in a single-ended design. Everything that occurs is generally polarized with respect to the lowest sounding tone, the bass. Sonorities belong to their bass notes and to their respective scale steps by virtue of the asymmetrical structure of each sonority that identifies it most closely with one particular bass note, root, or scale step. On the other hand, symmetrical music is organized around some middle pitch, "middle c," for instance; and the things that happen above that pitch are mirrored, balanced, or justified by other things that happen in symmetrical fashion below that pitch. It does seem, for instance, that the twelve-tone system is a special case of symmetricity, the chromatic scale being sym- metrical around any of its members. Other scales or systems are also symmetrical: the whole-tone scale or whole-tone har- mony, for instance. The augmented triad, full-diminished seventh chord, the whole-tone-half-tone scale, and others are also symmetrical around a pitch or pairs of pitches. These various structures were the foundation upon which twentieth- century music came into being. SYMMETRY AS A PRIMARY STRUCTURAL FORCE IN 20TH-CENTURY MUSIC: SCALES, MELODY, HAR- MONY, AND COUNTERPOINT The force use of in symmetry nature and in art a primary is anything means but new. of organization It is a primary in force in nature and a primary means of organization in most of the arts, and has been so for thousands of years. What is so peculiar is the notion that symmetry should suddenly come to the fore as a force in music in the 20th century. After all, symmetry is a primary structural element in Egyptian art, in Greek architecture, in Classical painting, etc. Symmetry is also found everywhere in nature: the human body, the duality</page><page sequence="3">century music by Debussy, Ravel, and others. For example, the familiar "Petrouchka" chord, consisting of two major triads a tritone apart, is an example of paired symmetry and bisec- tion of the octave. This chord can be found earlier in Ravel's "Jeux d'eau. " A very frequent technique in twentieth-century music of several styles (Impressionistic, Neo-Classical, Serial, Twelve- Tone, etc.) involves the division of the octave into two sym- metrical halves at the tritone and then building paired struc- tures on each of the two bass tones. The resultant may be a scale, a chord, an arppeggio, or whatever. The use to which such an entity is put will vary with the stylistic orientation of the composer. At any rate, this is a frequently-found type of symmetry in twentieth-century music that would not have been used before the development of chromaticism, liberation of the dissonance, etc. At L this to employ point it would symmetry only be exists fair to throughout acknowledge the that history a desire of L to employ symmetry exists throughout the history of music, and that composers did so at every opportunity, limited only by the asymmetry of the musical system. Some examples can be found in the music of the 16th through 19th centuries and these are worth noting. For example, the symmetrical bisection of the octave, while not useful in melodic or harmonic purposes until the late 19th- and early-20th centuries. Done by means of the dual function of the major-minor seventh chord, modulation to and from tritone-related keys is common enough in Mozart, Schubert, Tchaikowsky, and many other composers. This is achieved by means of the re-spelling of the dominant seventh chord as a ' 4 German* ' augmented sixth chord that resolves to a chord whose root is a tritone away from the initial tonic. This is the familiar-enough technique known as "enharmonic modulation.' ' Another common symmetry in traditional tonal music is the symmetry of the dominant and subdominant tones with respect to the tonic. One is a fifth up and the other a fifth down from the tonic. This symmetry is employed in many different forms by having the initial motion of a piece go away from the tonic key to the dominant. Then at the end of the piece, motion is from the subdominant to the tonic (both motions being up a perfect fifth). When using this type of symmetry, the subdomi- nant key is saved until the coda or ending; the use of that key signifies the approaching end of the composition. In fact, the use of one more flat or one less sharp in the composition is widely taken to mean an approaching final cadence in a wide variety of functional harmonic music. At this point I feel that it would be particularly interesting to speculate upon the subsconscious factors influencing com- posers and affecting the success of their music. For example, what is the significance of a desire for symmetry in the course of composing? Why should symmetry be any more desirable than any other structural technique? Examples of symmetry are to be found frequently in 20th-century music. There is nothing new about that observation. Why should symmetry be taken as an ultimate, fundamental structural force in 20th-century music? To begin with, we know that composers consciously gave up a great deal of structural security by accepting chromaticism, greater dissonance, more noise or non-pitched sound, atonality, greater diversity of sonorities, and so forth. It would be natural desire for many composers to seek means whereby they could build greater order into the materials and forms with which they are working. Not only that, but most composers would prob- ably feel more comfortable and would feel better assured that they are going in a satisfactory direction if they had some idea of a system they could apply in starting to work. Even if they were not consciously aware of this desire, the very act of com- posing would lead them to repeat patterns of pitches at various pitch levels and in various mirror and retrograde forms. The widespread use of contrapuntal instruction for young composers would assure that they would be aware of these possibilities. The repetition of pitches at various levels, and in inversions and retrograde in diatonic music, leads to the modifications known as "tonar' modifications (answers, sequence, transposi- tion, etc.) which spoils the symmetry. This effect must have bothered many composers over the years, but it was made necessary by the need to preserve the tonality and the control of dissonance. Once these things were shown to be expendable, it would have been obvious to nearly all composers in classical forms that exact symmetry now become possible. The point is that each composer had this experience in his own limited idiom: Ravel and Debussy in Impressionism, Stravinsky and Hindemith in neo-classicism, Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern in expres- sionism and later in serialism, and somewhat later in the cen- tury, Penderecki, Ligeti, and Xenakis in soundmass. Many peo- ple have pointed out individual examples of symmetrical struc- tures in much of their music. The thing that has not been noted is the commonality of the search for symmetry in all of these composers' work, since it occurs in so many different ways and on so many different levels. I hope to have shown, though, that symmetry is a fundamen- tal force of nature and a fundamental principle in art of all sorts. What could be more natural than for any composer to seek to employ as much of it in as many different ways as possible? The new freedoms of the early twentieth century made this possi- ble; it would seem to be an expected thing that composers would pursue the working-out of symmetrical structures once it was made possible for them to do so. ❖ i 1</page></plain_text>
