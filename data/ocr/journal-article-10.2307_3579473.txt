<plain_text><page sequence="1">Radiation Shielding, J. Kenneth Shultis and Richard E. Faw, Prentice Hall PTR, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1996, 533 pages, $85. This excellent book is a revision and expansion of Principles of Radiation Shielding by A. B. Chilton J. K. Shultis and R. E. Faw, published in 1984. It is dedi- cated to the memory of Arthur Chilton, who was a recognized leader in the field of radiation transport and shielding for more than 30 years. The book is designed to be a textbook for use in university courses on the subjects of radiation sources, interactions, transport and shielding. It requires that the student have a good command of mathematics through calculus, vector analysis and differential equations. Each chapter fol- lowing the Introduction ends with a set of problems for the student to solve. The book is also designed to be a reference for the shielding practitioner. The dual purpose of this book has led to some compromises, as pointed out by the authors. The prin- ciples of shielding analysis are discussed thoroughly, and because of space limitations, this has led to a more general discussion of computer codes used for shielding that leaves out many of the nuances that would be of interest to the shield designer. Although this is a book dealing with shielding and not radiation dosimetry, a significant portion of the text is devoted to methods for dose calculation. In general these methods are important for the understanding of the shielding problem. If there is a deficiency in this book, it is that it does not address the special concerns associated with shielding particle accelerators. The orientation is toward shielding photons and neutrons emanating from radioactive sources and nuclear reactors. The radiation energies considered rarely exceed a few MeV. There is occasional reference to X rays, but only in the energy range up to a few hundred kilovolts. No men- tion is made of the high-energy phenomena of electro- magnetic or hadronic cascade showers. Chapter 1 pro- vides a good compilation of shielding resources, but it</page><page sequence="2">360 BOOK REVIEWS focuses on reactor shielding and omits reference to those that deal specifically with accelerator shielding. Chapter 2 is a general discussion of radiation fields and sources. It covers quantities such as fluence and fluence rate, and properties such as directional depen- dence of fluence and flow. Chapter 3 contains a detailed treatment of photon, electron and neutron interactions, including scattering. Interaction kin- ematics is formulated and the expressions for inter- action cross sections are derived. Much of the material in this chapter was contained in the previous text. Radiation sources are treated in Chapter 4; this is fundamentally the same as the chapter in Principles of Radiation Shielding, but it contains updated material in many of the tables. Chapter 5 has been completely rewritten and discusses response functions for photons and neutrons linking the physical description of the radiation field to the radiation sensor response. There is a brief up-to-date discussion of dosimetric and dose equivalent quantities. The concept of response function is developed in mathematical detail for both photons and neutrons. Finally, the response function for the human as target is treated in some detail for both sim- ple geometric and anthropomorphic phantoms employing the most recent ICRU dose equivalent quantities. Before the authors get into the specifics of shielding, there follows a chapter titled "Basic Methods for Dose Calculations." This chapter develops the mathematical formulations for calculating dose resulting from uncollided radiation from point and dis- tributed sources of various geometries. After that the point kernel concept for total dose is treated. A gener- alized method for evaluating dose in an infinite homo- geneous medium is developed to include volumetric sources and expanded to account for density variations. Finally, factors are derived to describe a variety of source geometries. Chapters 7 (photons) and 8 (neutrons) are the heart of the book as far as shielding and radiation transport are concerned. Here the reader finds the expected detailed treatment of buildup factors, attenuation, albedo, skyshine and streaming through ducts that is necessary to a complete understanding of the subject. These two chapters replace chapters 7, 8 and 9 of the previous text and expand the conceptual development of these topics. Sacrificed is the section on shielding of medical facilities that appeared in Principles of Radiation Shielding; such a section at this time would be largely out of date and omitting it is no great loss. Chapter 9 returns to a discussion of the spatial distribu- tion of dose, this time from cx- and P-particle sources. Point kernels, energy spectra and particle ranges are derived. This seems to be somewhat of a digression into dosimetry since shielding is not addressed. One might have expected a discussion of shielding for P- particle sources, especially the consideration of bremsstrahlung production, and the shielding of high- energy electrons with the accompanying electromag- netic shower. The final two chapters detail calculational methods for radiation transport. Chapter 10 is essentially the same as Chapter 10 in the previous text, retitled "Deterministic Transport Theory," with the exception that a section has been added on the integral transport method and the previous section on the Monte Carlo method has been given a chapter of its own. Because of the advances in high-speed computing in the past decade, Monte Carlo techniques have become widely available for radiation transport and shielding calcula- tions. Their importance is reflected in Chapter 11, in which various techniques are introduced that will guide the reader in the application of the Monte Carlo method. The final chapter on shielding materials that appeared in Principles of Radiation Shielding has been omitted. A valuable resource in this text, as in the previous one, are the appendices that provide needed physical constants, mathematical formulations, cross sections, response functions, buildup and attenuation factors, skyshine functions, fission-product source parameters and photons emitted by a broad selection of radionuclides. One can always find typographical errors and over- sights in any book. There are few in this text and nothing very serious. In section 9.3 the figures and tables are referred to in the text as if they were in chapter 1, i.e. 1.X instead of 9.X. It is somewhat trou- bling that, although the authors state that SI units are generally followed with the exception of the inclusion of special units in common usage, interaction coeffi- cients and cross sections are not given in SI units. Also, Appendices D, E and F mix some units, such as Sv-cm2 and rad in some tables, Sv in others. Overall this is an excellent resource and should be considered as a text for any course on radiation trans- port and shielding. It should also be on the shelf of anyone who is involved in designing shielding for radi- ation sources. Kenneth R. Kase Stanford Linear Accelerator Center P. O.
