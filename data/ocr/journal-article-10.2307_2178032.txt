<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. The Idea of God in the Light of Recent Philosophy. (The Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Aberdeen in the years I9I2 and I9I3.) By A. SETH PRINGLE-PATTISON. Clarendon Press, Oxford, I9I7.-PP. xvi, 423. This volume,-the publication of which, as the author explains in his brief Preface, has been delayed by "distractions and anxieties arising out of the war,"-is difficult to describe in summary fashion. At a time when philosophical novelties are rather too much in evidence, and when the serious student of philosophy has long since learned to discount new terms and phrases, Professor Pringle-Pattison has chosen to remain constant to his characteristic method of 'construc- tion through criticism,' as he himself describes this. It is hardly necessary to remark that work of this kind is neither less nor more original than that which might seem almost the opposite in character. The great constructive works of philosophy are on a different plane, but they are on a plane by themselves. As is usual, I believe, in the case of 'Gifford Lectures,' the First and Second Series consist of ten lectures each. While the subject-matter of the two Series is not sharply distinguished, the First Series is de- voted, more particularly, to the philosophical foundation and the Second Series to the discussion of the more special problems of the philosophy of religion. Lecture I of the First Series is on "Hume's 'Dialogues concerning Natural Religion'," and Lecture II is on " Kant and the Idea of Intrinsic Value." Professor Pringle-Pattison's choice of Hume's posthumously published 'Dialogues' as a point of departure was probably suggested by the fact that the year the First Series of Lectures began to be delivered was the bi-centenary anni- versary of the philosopher's birth. In any case, his interesting, if somewhat elaborate, analysis of Hume's subtle argument forms a natural introduction to Lecture II, which may properly be regarded as the real beginning of the 'critical-constructive' treatment. Here the author indicates his attitude toward Kant and modern Idealism,- an attitude which does much to determine the direction of the whole succeeding argument. In making the conception of value central for a theory of reality regarded as an organic whole, Kant was fully justified, and he thus became the true founder of the philosophical 649</page><page sequence="2">650 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. method somewhat too vaguely called 'Idealism'; but, unfortunately, it was precisely in his ethical and religious philosophy that Kant made the greatest and, as it proved, the most unnecessary concessions to the artificial eighteenth century ideal. Professor Pringle-Pattison, though himself taking a profoundly ethical view of the world-problem, is not to be carried away by pious rhetoric or moral sentimentality. As he says by way of comment, "Job is not to serve God for naught after all" (p. 32). Indeed, it is morally necessary, according to Kant, to assume the existence of God, in order that we may be assured that Job-and also we ourselves-will be paid in full. But the objection is obvious: "Surely if, as Kant insists, it is wrong to treat a human being merely as a means, it must be a false way of putting things to present God himself in this merely instrumental light-as a dens ex machine introduced to effect the equation between virtue and happi- ness " (p. 34). Kant's own questionable procedure, however, did not permanently hamper Idealism. "This conception of intrinsic value as the clue to the ultimate nature of reality is the fundamental contention of all idealistic philosophy since Kant's time " (p. 38). Not only so, as regards Kant's immediate successors in Germany; but " it becomes still more markedly the watchword of Idealism in the long duel with an encroaching Naturalism, which was the engrossing concern of the nineteenth century, and which has shaped for us the specific form in which the theistic problem, as the ultimate question of philosophy, presents itself to the modern mind" (ibid.). Lecture III is devoted to a discussion of the issues involved in this "Nineteenth-Century Duel between Idealism and Naturalism." This prolonged conflict, of course, followed the collapse, temporary at least, of the great German idealistic systems, and was a burning issue during the last half of the nineteenth century. Some of the factors that made for this controversy are plainly apparent. The unprecedented prestige of physical and, still more, of biological science almost inevitably led to the attempt to make science, in a more generalized form, take the place of philosophy. On the other hand, the opponents of Naturalism were not slow to point out that the prob- lem of values could not be ignored permanently and that this might very well prove to be the ultimate problem. But Professor Pringle- Pattison shows that, on the technical side, the idealists among popular philosophers put themselves at a needless disadvantage by regarding the problem of values as a separate problem,-thus perpetuating the false Kantian antithesis between 'knowledge' and 'faith.' One might add that nothing could illustrate better the danger, from the side</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 65I of our spiritual interests, of taking a short cut to a desirable-or desired-end. Frankly admitting that Kant's philosophy as a whole means much more than his hopelessly dualistic method might seem to imply, and that a good deal, at least, in the later development of German Idealism was profoundly significant, Professor Pringle-Pattison pertinently re- marks: " Nevertheless, the broad fact remains, . . . that, for the average nineteenth-century thinker, it was the negative side of Kant's teaching-the critical limitation of knowledge to the world of sense- perception-that was of real significance; and the Kantian phenom- enalism came to be identified with a somewhat facile agnosticism or relativism " (pp. 50, 5i). This statement is Justified by the author, not only by reference to Sir William Hamilton, Spencer, and Huxley, but to Lange, whose influential History of Materialism was an impor- tant factor in the 'return to Kant' movement in Germany. The "fine ethical undertone" of Lange's History is duly recognized; but his crude opposition of the 'real' (as defined by the mechanistic system of materialism) to the 'ideal,' all too vaguely imagined, is criticised as essentially unphilosophical. In this connection, the author quotes Martineau's highly significant remark: "Amid all the sickly talk about 'ideals' which has become the commonplace of our age, it is well to remember that, so long as they are a mere self-painting of the yearning spirit, they have no more solidity or steadiness than floating air- bubbles, gay in the sunshine and broken by the passing wind" (p. 53). In the latter part of the chapter, the dangers of anti-intellectualism are illustrated by reference to writers as widely and fundamentally different as Mr. Balfour and Mr. Kidd. Lecture IV, "The Liberating Influence of Biology," is a natural introduction to Lectures V and VI, "The Lower and the Higher Naturalism" and "Man as Organic to the World." It is hardly necessary to say that, in his discussion of certain recent tendencies of biology, Professor Pringle-Pattison does not profess expert knowl- edge of the subject or adopt uncritically even the general position of Neo-Vitalism as a controversial standpoint. He merely welcomes what he believes to be the gradual breaking-down of the older form of the mechanistic theory, which assumed that all strictly scientific explanations in biology must be in terms of pure physics or chemistry. Moreover, he believes that the present undoubted revival of general interest in philosophy is closely connected with the larger ideals of the special sciences, as held by the scientists themselves. Professor Pringle-Pattison's conception of "The Lower and the</page><page sequence="4">652 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. Higher Naturalism," discussed in Lecture V, involves the distinction already suggested. This practically means the difference between 'levelling down,' in scientific or naturalistic explanations, and recog- nizing significant differences where they appear. The author urges throughout these Lectures that the latter method alone does justice to the principle of 'continuity,' assumed as a postulate alike by science and philosophy. It is to be noted that he says: " Epigenesis or creative synthesis in the sense indicated does not necessarily imply, so far as I can see, the pluralism and contingency with which Professor Ward identifies, or at least associates, it" (p. 95, note). As indicating his own position, he says: "The philosophical meaning of potentiality is, in short, simply the insight that, in the interpretation of any process, it is the process as a whole that has to be considered, if we wish to know the nature of the reality revealed in it. In other words, every evolu- tionary process must be read in the light of its last term. This is the true meaning of the profound Aristotelian doctrine of the Telos or End as the ultimate principle of explanation" (p. io6). In Lecture VI, "Man as Organic to the World," Professor Pringle- Pattison attempts to employ the conception of 'continuity,' as he understands it, as a key to the nature of reality. Truth is to be found in the whole and the world is not complete or intelligible without man. The author says: "The so-called epistemological problem which obsesses modern philosophy, from Descartes and Locke to Kant and Spencer and the most recent magazine discussions . . . depends upon the presupposition of a finished world, as an independently existing fact, and an equally independent knower, equipped, from heaven knows where, with a peculiar apparatus of faculties. . . . Do what we may, our faculties get between us and the things, and we never know anything as it really is" (pp. III, II2). On occasion Professor Pringle-Pattison is able to see the redeeming side of Natu- ralism itself, but he never manifests anything but impatience,-some- times exaggerated, perhaps,-at what he regards as gratuitous 'sub- jectivism.' In fact, his impatience at what he more or less justi- fiably regards as unreal problems sometimes leads him to overlook or minimize problems that cannot be dismissed thus summarily. At any rate, however, he is right in one important respect,-perhaps the most important in the present connection. If knowledge is hopelessly undermined by scepticism as a result of the infection of 'subjectivism,' it is pure dogmatism to hold that 'values' will resist the same sinister disintegrating process. And he properly refuses to regard knowledge itself as an isolated, purely cognitive function. He</page><page sequence="5">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 653 says: " It is . . . living experience, steeped in feeling and instinct with action, which is the real fact in which cognition, as such, is but an element" (p. II4). Lecture VII, " Ethical Man: The Religion of Humanity," is devoted to a careful and not wholly unsympathetic criticism of Comte. While the author naturally finds the ideal of a 'Religion of Humanity' un- satisfactory, he does not rule the French philosopher out of court in the summary way that used to be too common. Instead of criticizing Comte for not belonging to the orthodox development of nineteenth century thought, Professor Pringle-Pattison finds in him a good deal that illustrates the better side of nineteenth century popular philoso- phy, but more that illustrates the two characteristic elements of weakness in the thought of this period that he is emphasizing through- out,-agnosticism based upon a false 'subjectivism' in philosophical standpoint and method and a dangerous isolation of the ethical and religious problems. This criticism of method is developed with more special reference to the problems of religion in Lecture VIII, " Posi- tivism and Agnosticism." The two remaining Lectures of the First Series, IX, "Idealism and Pan-Psychism," and X, " Idealism and Mentalism," as the titles would imply, round out the author's treatment of the general problems of philosophy, in so far as they have an acknowledged bearing upon the religious problem. As might be expected, Professor Pringle-Pattison has little sympathy with some of the later developments of idealistic or spiritualistic philosophy. He says: "A spiritual philosophy which is sure of itself feels no temptation to deny or to minimize the me- chanical aspects of the cosmos on which its higher life reposes. On the contrary, nature, as a realm of inviolable law, appears . . . to be the necessary condition of the life of intelligence and reasonable action" (pp. I78, I79). It is worth noticing that, in this respect, the author fully agrees with Professor Bosanquet, though he finds it necessary to criticise the latter's absolutistic monism in the Second Series, where he is more directly concerned with the essential problems of the philosophy of religion. After criticising some of the less closely reasoned forms of 'pan- psychism,' like Clifford's 'mind-stuff' theory, the author comes to terms with the form of monadism developed in Professor Ward's later series of Gifford Lectures, The Realm of Ends. In particular, he criticises Professor Ward's emphasis of contingency as really basal in the ultimate spiritual order and his apparent acceptance of C. S. Peirce's suggestion that physical laws represent the result of the action</page><page sequence="6">654 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. and reaction of psychic entities "in their struggle for the best modus vivendi " (p. I 84). The author very pertinently urges that this fanciful theory appears to over-leap itself; "for surely the very consolidation of actions into habits depends upon the pre-existence of a stable system of conditions." And he adds: " What meaning can we attach to actions in abstracto, apart from any environment? The laudable desire to save spontaneity and freedom seems, by denying necessity altogether, to fall into the other extreme of pure chance" (ibid.). He concludes: " It is sufficient for the purposes of Idealism that nature as a whole should be recognized as complementary to mind, and pos- sessing therefore no absolute existence of its own apart from its spiri- tual completion" (p. I 89). The concluding Lecture of the First Series, Lecture X, "Idealism and Mentalism," may be described as an attempt on the part of Pro- fessor Pringle-Pattison to disentangle Idealism, in the rather catholic sense in which he understands and holds the position, from 'Men- talism,' as the late Professor Sidgwick called it, viz., the doctrine that the being of things is dependent throughout upon their being known. And the author makes it plain from the start that he has in mind not only Berkeleianism or 'subjective idealism,' but also the traditional form of British Neo-Hegelianism. The unsatisfactoriness of 'subjective idealism,' when clearly recognized as such, is generally admitted; but the mere shifting of the emphasis from the individual knower to the All-Knower does not really help matters. "Transcendental ideal- ism is just Berkeleian idealism in excelsis, Berkeleianism universalized and applied on the cosmic scale" (p. 193). The criticism of T. H. Green which follows would be more damaging if it were more evidently consistent. Green is first criticised for holding that mind brings into being and maintains an order and harmony that would not otherwise exist in nature (p. i96); later we are told: "The formal Ego, which is all that the mentalistic argument yields, is of no real account." And the author asks: "What difference does it make whether we regard nature as existing per se, or insist that all her processes are registered in a mind, if that mind is nothing but such a register or impartial reflection of the facts?" (Pp. I99, 200.) Something, perhaps, might be said for either criticism of Green, particularly for the first; but the two go ill together, and the apparent suggestion, in the last passage quoted, that Green's theory really involves the fallacy of 'representative perceptionism,' is hardly worthy of so seasoned a critic as the author. He would have done better to hold to his original criticism that Green took too literally Kant's principle that 'the understanding gives laws</page><page sequence="7">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 655 to nature.' But, however this may be, Professor Pringle-Pattison makes it abundantly plain that, according to his view, the true foundation of Idealism is to be found in our experience of values, rather than in theory of knowledge or metaphysics separately con- sidered. For the justification of this position, one mustvturn to the Second Series of Lectures. Lecture XI, "The Argument of the First Course," is merely or mainly a summary, as the title would indicate. Lecture XII, however, "The Criterion of Value: Its Nature and Justification," is evidently intended as the beginning of the author's constructive treatment of the more special problems of religion that remain to be considered in the Second Series. The reviewer must confess to his disappointment in this Lecture and the following one on "The Ideal and the Actual." At length we are face to face with the problem which Professor Pringle-Pattison regards as absolutely basal to philosophy and he explicitly accepts the principle, "that the nature of reality can only mean the systematic structure discernible in its appearances, and that this must furnish us with our ultimate criterion of value " (p. 225). In other words, he accepts " the criterion on which 'absolutist' writers like Mr. Bradley and Professor Bosanquet lay so much stress" (ibid.). But, instead of proceeding at once to the long-delayed exact statement of his own position, the author explains at considerable length,-as he did much more satisfactorily in his very able long review of the Appearance and Reality, which appeared soon after its publication, nearly twenty-five years ago,-wherein he be- lieves Mr. Bradley has failed in applying his test of 'consistency' as determining the nature of the Absolute. For a trans-Atlantic reader, it is difficult to understand why Mr. Bradley's glittering paradoxes in the Appearance and Reality should have produced such a hypnotic effect upon British philosophers of his generation. In his Ethical Studies and his Principles of Logic, Mr. Bradley had done very important pioneer work, and many of his later articles, particularly some of those published in recent years and included in his Essays on Truth and Reality, are worthy of the most careful consideration; but, in spite of the universally admitted subtlety of the Appearance and Reality, one is inclined to wonder if this book has not done more to discredit Absolute Idealism in the minds of those not predestined to that way of thinking than all the polemics directed against British Neo-Hegel- ianism. Lecture XIII, "The Ideal and the Actual," is hardly more satis- fying. The author regards as particularly significant the existence</page><page sequence="8">656 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. of ideals of perfect Truth and Beauty and Infinite Goodness in the finite mind. In fact, we are told: "The presence of the Ideal is the reality of God within us." He pertinently adds: "This is, in essen- tials, the famous argument for the existence of God which meets us at the beginning of modern philosophy-the argument from the fact of man's possession of the idea of a Perfect Being" (p. 246). But philosophy has had a long development since Descartes, and the 'facts' accepted nowadays have generally been pretty carefully scrutinized first. The early rationalists, following Descartes, nearly all assumed that we have the idea of a Perfect Being, just as they assumed that we have a practically intuitive conception of 'substance.' But the empiricists and others largely exorcised the spectre of 'substance' by the simple device of asking exactly what the term meant. The same test inevitably suggests itself to the present-day technical student of philosophy, when the idea of the Most Perfect Being is mentioned. What do we mean by that well-rounded phrase? Obviously our idea of God is no more adequate than it is, and examination tends to show that it is rather pitifully inadequate. It is playing with words to dogmatize about a Perfect Being, when we are unable even to explain what we mean by 'perfection.' No one wishes to have his opponent in a theological argument sum up the controversy by remarking (as in Professor Bosanquet's anecdote in the Logic): "Oh I see, my dear sir, your God is my Devil." If we have the idea of God at all,- and the reviewer would be the last to deny this,-it must have some content, however vague. And it will not do to start with a vaguely conceived type of values, conventionally accepted, and merely im- agine this raised to the nth power. Even theologians are at last coming to agree that mere All-Mightiness does not constitute a proper ideal of God. In this connection it is only fair to remember that, if T. H. Green depends too much upon the conception of the Eternal Consciousness in his more ambitious epistemological and metaphysical speculations, he also gives, in the Prolegomena to Ethics, a most interest- ing and valuable explanation of the very gradual development of our concrete ethical and spiritual ideals. Professor Pringle-Pattison's criticisms of Green are sometimes well justified, but there is another and better side of Green's teaching that is unfortunately neglected in these Lectures. Thus far the argument of the Second Series has,.for the most part, been on the plane of enlightened common-sense rather than of tech- nical philosophy. Lectures XIV and XV, "The Absoute and the Finite Individual," are both devoted to an elaborate and rather tech-</page><page sequence="9">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 657 nical discussion and criticism of Professor Bosanquet's treatment of this problem in the last Series of his Gifford Lectures, The Value and Destiny of the Individual. The author singles out for criticism what he regards as Professor Bosanquet's 'curiously grudging' treatment of what he himself calls 'the formal distinctness' of selves or souls. The general trend of the criticism is expressed in the following passage: "It would seem . . . as if the unity with which the system concludes tends to abolish the plurality of centres from which it starts. Their individual and, so far, separate existence cannot, of course, be denied as a fact of experience; but it is represented as 'appearance' or illusion, due to the impotence of our finite point of view, and quite unreal 'from the side of the Absolute "' (p. 276). This, of course, is the conventional criticism of Absolute Idealism, but the details of Professor Pringle- Pattison's long critique are by no means lacking in originality and suggestiveness. At the same time, it is always to be remembered that both Series of Professor Bosanquet's Gifford Lectures are alto- gether more technical and more constructive than the present Series of Lectures by his eminent critic, and that, whatever may be the difficulties for the serious student of philosophy inherent in The Principle of Individuality and Value and The Value and Destiny of the Individual, they make a very different impression when viewed in the light of the system as a whole than when isolated and criticised from the standpoint of more conventional religious ideals. Lecture XVI, " The Idea of Creation," is also rather disappointing. It ought not to take a whole lecture to explain,-or admit, however reluctantly,-that the theological conception of creation out of nothing can only become a philosophical conception by being trans- formed practically beyond recognition. Almost at the end of the Lecture, when expressing an unexpected degree of appreciation for certain sides of Professor Howison's rather fantastic philosophy of religion, Professor Pringle-Pattison allows himself to speak very care- lessly on the subject of moral freedom. "He [Professor Howison] has clearly perceived that a self-conscious being is, by his very nature, raised above the sphere of efficient causality as that operates in a world of things. Such a being is inaccessible to force or action from without: nothing can be effected in a self except through the personal will of the agent himself. A person cannot be coerced, he can only be persuaded; and if he is effectually persuaded, his decision becomes the expression of his whole nature" (p. 3i9). This seems like a bad case of the type of ethical dualism that the author has criticised in Kant. It is true that merely physical categories, taken by themselves</page><page sequence="10">658 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. as self-sufficient, are inapplicable to the moral life; but this does not mean that, as moral beings, we are disembodied spirits. No philo- sophical treatment of the moral life is intelligible that does not take serious account of our physical limitations. But this is not all: if it were not for the wholesome authority of enlightened public opinion, which, at times like the present, is capable of becoming almost a com- pelling power, the moral life would be a chaos. Moreover, as has often been pointed out, abstract and impracticable moral 'idealism' is likely to employ the very formulas and catch-words of 'philosophical anarchy.' There is a great deal in the moral and social as well as in the physical order that we 'consent to,' not because we are 'persuaded,' but because we must. It may be remembered that, when Carlyle was told that Margaret Fuller 'accepted' the world-order, he char- acteristically remarked: " Egad, she had better!" Lectures XVII and XVIII, "Teleology as Cosmic Principle" and "Time and Eternity," logically belong together, as the author points out. While neither Lecture can be regarded as important from the side of philosophical 'construction,' the one on "Time and Eternity" is rather the best statement of the general problem for the intelligent but non-technical reader with which the reviewer is acquainted. Lecture XIX, "Bergsonian Time and a Growing Universe," may fairly be called a somewhat more technical appendix to the imme- diately preceding discussion. It is better criticism than a good deal that precedes, partly because more sympathetic, which is not to imply that Professor Pringle-Pattison by any means agrees with what are probably to be regarded as Bergson's 'conclusions.' Lecture XX, the concluding one, on " Pluralism-Evil and Suffering," first passes in review Dr. Rashdall's theory of a limited God, Dr. McTaggart's Absolute as a society of self-existent persons, and Wil- liam James's 'Pluralistic Universe.' The author then turns to the problem of evil and suffering and devotes what seems rather unneces- sary space to the somewhat antiquated, though always interesting, arguments of Hume and J. S. Mill on that subject. Hume's position is too much that of the eighteenth century to be exactly relevant, while the author's interpretation and criticism of Mill's arguments keeps too close to Mill's inherited hedonism and does not take sufficient account of his perhaps unconscious, but sometimes pronounced, leaning toward the ideal of self-development as an end in itself. Since Mill's " Man- ichaean hypothesis of two warring principles of good and evil" (p. 401) is criticised in rather the conventional way, he might at least have been given more credit for introducing the frank discussion of the ideal</page><page sequence="11">No. 6.1 REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 659 of a finite or limited God. The philosophical difficulties of this position are doubtless very considerable and perhaps fatal; but one can hardly fail to recognize that the whole discussion has tended to preserve and emphasize that higher anthropomorphism which must be preserved, unless the idea of God is to be 'merged and transmuted' into the idea of a too abstractly conceived Absolute. The problem of Evil can hardly be solved, or even made intelligible, by any method of 'absent treatment,' after the amiable manner of Christian Science. Prefacing his own brief concluding treatment of the ultimate prob- lem, Professor Pringle-Pattison frankly says: "To reach any credible theory of the relation of God and man we must . . . profoundly transform the traditional idea of God" (p. 399). In particular, he urges: "We must remember how closely the associations of oriental monarchy have wound themselves round the God-idea. The popular use of 'the Almighty,' as an appellation of the Divine Being, may be said, with some truth, to perpetuate the pretensions of these poten- tates and the flatteries of their helpless subjects. In itself, the predi- cate completely lacks the element of value, for it simply means able to do anything" (p. 403). And he continues: "The traditional ideal, to a large extent an inheritance of philosophy from theology, may be not unfairly described as a fusion of the primitive monarchical ideal with Aristotle's conception of the Eternal Thinker" (p. 407). As against this philosophically and spiritually unsatisfying ideal, Pro- fessor Pringle-Pattison turns to the ideal of 'the suffering God,' characteristic of the mythologies of a number of the higher forms of religion. He objects to the mechanical procedure of popular Christian theology, which conceives of Father and Son as practically two dis- tinct personalities,-" the Father perpetuating the old monarchical ideal and the incarnation of the Son being limited to a single historical individual " (p. 409). After these rather unconventional prelimi- naries, the author emphasizes as central to any universal scheme of values the traditional Christian ideal of self-sacrifice,-" in the Pauline phrase, dying to live, in the words of Jesus, losing one's life to find it." Hence he infers the existence of "a God who lives in the perpetual giving of himself, who shares the life of his finite creatures, bearing in and with them the whole burden of their finitude, their sinful wanderings and sorrows, and the suffering without which they cannot be made perfect" (p. 4I I). This is not a solution of the metaphysical difficulties so long dwelt upon; but one can hardly quarrel with the eminent Lecturer for defining the living source of all values, as he conceives it, and calling this ideal God.
