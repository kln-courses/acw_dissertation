If suffi ciently intense and absolutely pure, they are ca pable of turning into a theological virtue: that of Hope. But then again, there is nothing cru eller than the nightmares that lurk in dark cor ners of a wakeful consciousness—they are the cause of the deepest woes, and carry the germ of the only truly definitive death: that which is eternal. These quivering shadows, the memory of which is a foretaste of both Heaven and Hell, are not restricted to possessing Individual beings. Societies and civilizations, too, can be blessed or tormented by them. This Is the category occu pied by gorgeous phantoms with glowing eyes— the ghosts fabricated by Orientalism. Our civilization, which for most of its millenarian history attributed a cosmic, transcendent identi ty to itself, chose a denomination in keeping with such an image. Its name, until the eighteenth cen tury, was Christendom. In the wake of the En lightenment, when seeking more modest hori zons limited only by human time, it chose to define itself by a term that pointed to its chief pole of Otherness. In order to give an account of its private self, this civilization decided to place itself along an imaginary axis between the two extremes of its consciousness, and adopt a name that would pinpoint it in relation to its most im portant cultural interlocutor and most feared ideological adversary. Our ancestors took for their name a position in space: thus, by contrast with a phantasmagorical East, Europe elected to be the West of our terrestrial globe. During the early days of Christianity, the main pole of symbolic difference was perceived as be ing classical paganism. After the Hegira, however, this role fell to Islam, which inserted itself mid way between the cultures claiming a Greco Roman inheritance, and the territories of Bud dhism or Hinduism, as during the Middle Ages, the old Silk Road was broken into segments. Eleven centuries later, a new phantasm came to replace this major referent in the European imaginary. The semiological substitute of Islam was, from the eighteenth century onward, the cultural version of that same religious milieu. And thus the word Orient, with its extraordi nary semantic charge (associating the lair of the morning sun with the Romance syllables of gold, or, oro), and solemn historical weight (the an tique prestige of China, Japan, India, Egypt, Persia, Byzantium), became ever more solidly embodied in one of the available versions of a cultural East: that marked by the legacy of the Koran. The European gaze, then, could label as Oriental territories both the coasts of the Arabian peninsula and the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Westerners distinguished a Far East (India and the China Seas), a Middle East (Syria, Lebanon and Turkey), and a Near East (located in the Balkans and North Africa). And thus a nice paradox emerges, highly reveal ing in terms of the tropisms of each civilization. For we regard as Oriental the region identified by Moslems as the West par excellence: al Maghrib, the kingdom of Morocco. From a European perspective, the Islamic world was always a source of confrontation. Its un trammeled expansion through the very cradle of Christendom (the lands of the Apostles and the Fathers of the Church) had sown profound disquiet among societies that defined themselves In confessional terms. The momentum of the new civilization seemed to be unstoppable. While at the Atlantic end of the Mediterranean its progress was being slowly reversed after sev eral centuries of steady expansion (around the year 1000), at the other extreme, on the Bos phorus, the close of the Middle Ages was sym bolized by one of the most shattering defeats ever to be impressed on the European mind: the fall of Constantinople, a city that was not only the headquarters of the Orthodox world but also the cultural capital of Christianity as a whole (the Greek and the Latin branches, the Oriental and the Occidental). A flame that had not been extinguished all through the medieval epoch, beaming forth, despite the Great Schism, all the beauty and learning of the Classical world conserved In the eastern part of the Holy Roman Empire, safe from the disturbances occasioned by the disintegration of the Empire along the axis that joined Italy to the North Sea. It was precisely in these Byzantine lands that Islam would unearth the remnants of Hellenic science and philosophy which so enriched it, and with which it was, in turn, to fertilize Europe by way of its outposts in Andalusia and Sicily. The city that had stood as the eastern beacon of Christianity was now converted into the cul tural capital of Islam—not the Arab strand of it (like Damascus, Baghdad or Cairo), but the Turkish. To European eyes, the link between the Moslem world and the picture of the Orient was thereby reinforced. A Cosmic Battle New Spain, an outgrowth of Iberian cultural space, was bound to appropriate the instruments and institutions of the metropolis; it also laid claim to Spanish music and symbols, dreams and night mares. By adopting Christianity and the Castilian language, Mexico became accredited as a province of the western world, peripheral perhaps, but firmly within its orbit. From the sixteenth cen tury onward, no alternative civilizing pole emerged that was capable of endorsing any other identity or project. The sovereigns of those kingdoms were the Hapsburgs whose bicephalous crown was under threat in both of its capitals—Vienna and Madrid— from Moslem assault: Arabs and Berbers to one side, Ottomans to the other. The viceroyalty thus inherited and internalized a double, contra dictory fantasy. The Moorish Orient meant beauty and refinement (Mudejar architecture, lavish, sensual interiors) and also the light of knowledge, science and technology, mathemat ics and agriculture; for who can mention Aqui nas without thinking Averroes? What is more, the affinities between the impassioned élan of Saint Theresa and Saint John of the Cross in their pursuit of divine solace, and that which impelled the flights of Moslem (and Jewish) mystics, were becoming increasingly evident. At the same time, however, this Orient was the supreme nucleus of a contrary identity: a for midable cultural force, perceived as the greatest symbolic challenge and the most daunting geopo litical menace around. Over seven hundred years of strife and also of co-existence, readjustments, conversions and counter-conversions, betrayals and shifting allegiances; seven centuries of for bidden romances and also mixed marriages, against the backdrop of a massive cross-cultural tangle of ways of speaking, dressing and eating over all this time, the Spanish imaginary had to build up a model that was capable of keeping the struggle alive, justifying and strengthening it: the idea of Reconquest. For almost thirty generations, Christian Spain tended the paradigm that could channel the flow of signs pouring from her history. Thus a prin ciple of cohesion was born, that led to the vast and checkered landscape of peoples and fiefdoms merging into a monarchy united around just two crowns: that of Castile and that of Aragon. This founding paradigm was one of faith. It relied on the division between Christians and infidels, an opposition which was principally aimed at Moslems. The patron saint of Spain, the super natural sponsor of her hegemonic ambitions, possessed an essential attribute that was actual ly incorporated into his name: Santiago Mata moros—St. James the Moor-Slayer. This model of identity, or coordinates for un derstanding the world, were exported to New Spain, a land which had never seen a Moslem (let us not forget that Columbus had insisted up on the presence of at least one "Arab tongue" among his crew, and that this was the language in which the Caribbean natives were ar raigned). The American landmass that was supposed to be, according to European hopes, the richest and remotest of the Easts (the Indies) turned out to be farther west than the West—the last frontier, as we sail into the sun set, of the lands pertaining to the European cul tural sphere. In a society as powerfully marked by religious identity as colonial Mexico, history tends to be viewed in theological terms, as episodes in a cosmic fray between good and evil. Mexican society was further imbued, as were most peoples of the baroque, with a deep-seated sense of sacred rit ual and ceremonial theater. In New Spain, the liturgy was an organic way of linking everyday reality to the infinite machinery of the universe. Two genres, therefore, were soon absorbed in to the language of popular culture in Hapsburg ♦ S3 ♦ ALFONSO ALFARO</page><page sequence="4">Mexico. One was the pastorelle, a vivid staging of the tragedy of sin and the vast reach of re demption, whose intensity was tempered by a comic tone and lively pace, kept up by non-pro fessional actors. Here the main characters were angels and devils. The other genre consisted of a ceremonial representation of the battles of the Reconquest, a legacy of epic poetry, in which in digenous or mixed-race groups performed an "historical" reconstruction of that drama. Here the actors perform the roles of Moors and Christians. JnniGEnous OmEniALism It is significant that autochthonous populations should have proved the most receptive to such Iberian phantasms—especially flourishing in the Spanish Levant—about the Orient (this is one of the traits that gainsay the alleged virginity of its symbolic space). By pinpointing a real but dis tant foe—an adversary who represented no genuine threat—a common space was created, open to Spaniards and Indians alike. And here, a common we could be uttered that subsumed both groups—the first mestizo pronoun, the seed of what would become a nation. In this way many indigenous people managed to face up to defeat and quell their bewilderment, ac counting for the annihilation of the world that had been theirs and embarking on the transition towards another, in which they would strive to make a place for themselves; a world which, thanks to the assimilation of those phantasms and these common symbols, was now wholly theirs. In living dramas, their casts drawn straight from the community, indigenous peoples learned to relinquish what they once had been. They learned to adopt a new cosmogony, in which the rout of the ancient deities worshipped by their ancestors was given a meaning and an expla nation. The beings who had ruled the cycles of the universe "in the days of their sovereignty" had succumbed in a contest in which they—the few survivors, the baptized—stood shoulder to shoulder with the victorious St. James the Moor Slayer or John the Baptist. This fantastical Islam, whose shadow loomed over processes very far removed from the cultured, aesthetic Oriental ism that was to thrive in many European capitals, was a true foundational East for our country. RomAmic OniErn,u.ism The nations of enlightened Europe gave birth to a phenomenon that reached its apogee during the nineteenth century: Romantic Orientalism. This outlook arose in circles that were fully con fident of their cultural superiority, spaces where the confrontation with Islam had long lost the dramatic seriousness which still endured in Haps burg territories (Francis I had no trouble in shar ing strategic interests with the Sublime Gate, and England's geographical position made her vir tually invulnerable to any hypothetical threat from that quarter). This indulgent Orientalism was also influenced by the fact that the societies in which it flourished had the status of colonial powers. Our country was not immune to the winds of sensuality and refinement blowing from Europe on the wings of escapism, aflutter with erotic intensity and scented with all the promises of opulence; the breeze of Orientalist exoticism left us with façades lifted from the Alhambra and interiors that aspired to Mudejar or Turkish at mospheres, most of which, unfortunately, have fallen victim to indifference and neglect The Orieeit WiTHin Not many years later, however, one of our most illustrious artists was to propose a totally differ ent outlook, purged of pathos and of all spirit of antagonism (out went Charles Martel, the Re conquest and the battle of Lepanto). A most un Iberian perspective, and at the same time, thor oughly detached from the glowing intricacies of Romantic exoticism in northern Europe. Twen tieth-century Mexico made room for a fascination with the Moslem East that owed little to European precedents, via a secret passage be tween Mexico and North Africa that makes the crossing briefer than that between Algeciras and Tangiers. Luis Barragán, a patriotic man and an artist of the first rank, observed the sober lines of North African vernacular architecture, the aus tere grandeur of its volumes, the simplicity of its formal devices, and recognized in them the same serene disposition that steeped the buildings of his native region: the convents, ranches, hacien das, ancestral mansions and peasant dwellings. He saw the profound kinship that united the cul tures on both shores of the Mediterranean, the Andalusian and the Maghrebian, in a shared sensibility that could reconcile the depths of feeling with the simplicity of a visual language. Barragán was able to discover, in this universe, the essential keys to certain cultures of mesti zo Mexico: a sense of transcendence, sensorial intensity, the complementary nature of commu nal and private space. And he was able to en dow his architecture with an aesthetic expres sion of all this, that was at once distinctive and in tune with the times. Barragán's floor plans feature broken outlines, forming secluded, private spaces similar in mood to Moroccan architecture. Though his youthful forays were still colored by the infatu ation with picturesque localism that bedevils Ro mantic Orientalism, the achievements of his ma ture years gradually outgrew such exotic temptations. His work is impregnated with evocation and nostalgia, yet these features are not a yearning for the remote, inaccessible East of romanticism, but for quite different panora mas in which the aesthetic climate of the Mediterranean (an atmosphere that is common to Moslem, Catholic and Orthodox societies) still today gives shape and life to many Mexican vil lages and towns. The LAnGUAGE of Arabesque One of the most pervasive images we have of the Islamic world is that of an enchanted palace, whose powerful inhabitants seduced the poets of the Romantic era as easily as they did the be lievers who still enact the sacred dramaturgy of Moors and Christians. Yet the other Levantine presence, as opulent as the first, reaches deep er, and consists of abstract signs. It may be that craftsmen, who were the great wardens of this treasure, became infected with its secret pow ers without even knowing it. A language conveys much more than its explic it content. Thanks to its forms, it can produce sensorial effects that may not always be con sciously unpacked by the receivers. The signifiers of every discourse (the tracery of letters and numbers, the involuntary gestures, the inflections of speech) are the vehicles of messages every bit as important as the mani fest signifieds. What stories are told to us by the serpentine lines of Mudejar art? What are the carved wood en ceilings saying, the latticed plasterwork, the tiles whose patterns interlock over bright expans es of wall, the delicate labyrinths of marquetry? These signs speak to us of a world which as pired to realize all the possibilities of two-di mensional, non-figurative expression. They are the echo of a civilization founded upon five pil lars that proclaimed the oneness of God, his unbridgeable distance from the human race, and the axiom that theophany disposes of an excep tional, privileged resource: revealed wisdom (the Koran), whose vehicle (the Arabic language) is the standard of earthly perfection. In this world, enlightenment can only occur as a consequence of abandoning oneself to the clemency of the Merciful One. The Western tradition has been strongly influ enced by Greek anthropomorphism, combined with the Mystery of the Incarnation (for Chris tians, the pact between God and man was sealed through a human body, donned for the pur pose by the second member of the Trinity). This dual heritage did much to nourish the in terest of our civilization in exploring the possi bilities of three-dimensional figuration. In the Islamic world, by contrast, perceptible ex pressions of hierophany belong to the verbal sphere (the words uttered by God to his Prophet). For this reason the common prayer is essen tially a psalmody, and art attains its highest ful fillment in sacred calligraphy. The fluid lineaments of the Arab script itself, its interlaced, labyrinthine flow with extended lines to impart the vertigo of infinity: this is the essence of arabesque, the vital pattern through which Islam left its most indelible mark upon the active memory of Hispanic peoples. At the interface of cultures and civilizations (modern Mexico functions as a testing-ground of contact between the Iberian and the Anglo Saxon worlds), the possibilities of hybridization become multiplied. Minorities may resort to foreign words in order to make their voices heard, or use their own words to render new experiences, induced by the majority culture to which such experiences belong. Between the followers of Mohammed and those of Jesus, such interactions have been legion. In Spain, Mozarabs were the Christians living in Moslem areas who maintained their forms of ♦ S4 ♦</page><page sequence="5">expression and prayer (an art, a liturgy), al though waves of persecution, especially under the Almoravids, and the successes of the Reconquest gradually eroded their numbers and the vigor of their communities. Much later, at the other extreme of the chrono logical cycle, there were Moslems known as Mudejars who stayed in the new Christian ter ritories under the protection of the monarchs. After the fall of the Nazrid kingdom of Grana da, the Catholic monarchs signed pacts instat ing freedom of worship and guaranteed the se curity of all subjects' persons and possessions. Before long, though, their situation grew ex tremely precarious. The geopolitical clashes with Ottoman forces in the Mediterranean (exacer bated by Berber incursions), and the tensions at home caused by interethnic friction and uneasy relations between the Crown and the nobility, contributed to undermine the magnanimous covenants. In contrast with her speedy ampu tation of the Hebraic root, it took Spain over a hundred years—from the surrender of the Alhambra in 1492 to 1614 when the final expulsion of the Moriscos (converted Moslems) was de creed—to remove the last vestige of Islamicism. During the whole period of the conquest and sub sequent consolidation of overseas possessions, throughout the Renaissance and Mannerist eras and until the establishment of the baroque, the kingdoms ruled by Castile and Aragón consi sted a patchwork of cultures and religions. An age-old habit of proximity built of pleasures and quarrels and the pain of such a prolonged divorce are etched into the memory and the art of the two Mediterranean shores and the two Atlantic coasts. Spanish America preserves many traces of those "Arabs and Berbers of al-Andalus" (i.e. Spain under Moslem rule) who turned them selves into Mudejars and then into Moriscos, before becoming plain Moors all over again. Romantic Orientalism, born of the Enlighten ment, enabled us to behold once more with compelling curiosity—though admittedly from that dispassionate distance with which we re gard what is foreign—that component of our cultural heritage which began to fade in the eighteenth century. Any individual, from whatever civilization, who traces the capital letters of the Latin alphabet is wielding, almost always unconsciously, a set of tools with an implicit semantic charge (the naturalist anthropology and anxiety for bal ance proper to the Renaissance humanists who encoded the script of our civilization). In the same way, each arabesque flourish transports us back to a world in which the bridge linking time and eternity is engineered quite different ly from the one we Western tribesmen strive to cross. Those tendrils and liquid swirls in ever lasting flux are apt to arouse powerful aesthet ic sensations, for they let us overhear the whis per of a constant dialogue between God and man, conducted in a language we do not know. A Translated by Lorna Scott Fax. THE VERTEX REVEALED THE HJDDEfl FACE OF mEXJCAn CULTURE OUMAMA AOUAD LAHRECH From the Spanish shore I caught a glimpse of the Arab world and it dazzled me. Octavio Paz From Mexico we can now look towards the Arab Orient [...] without the vertically of European per ception as our vision's crux [...] It is thus about constructing an Orientalist view that in addition to being clearly lateral also has a double meaning. Alberto Ruy Sánchez Jf OITE were to give proper credit to the first person to see American soil during Christopher Columbus's first voyage, it would go to Rodrigo de Triana. The fed that he was a Moor is neg lected by official history. Nor is it known that, dis appointed by the admiral who never fulfilled his promise of a large reward for the first person to see land, he returned to Spain and from there to Morocco where it is said that he is buried in the city of Salé, the land of his ancestors. Another anecdote not recorded in conventional historiography is that one of the first languages to be spoken by the conquistadors on American soil was Arabic. Thinking that he was going to arrive at the court of the Great Khan and would there fore need someone who knew the Arabic lan guage, Columbus brought along Luis de Torres on his first expedition, one of the many Jews who had pseudo-converted and become "Arabi cized." Disembarking on the island of Cuba, he began to speak Arabic with the utterly stupe fied indigenous people. Despite the anecdotal and legendary nature of the stories that fill the pages left blank by offi cial history, these tales illustrate in an important and symbolic way the strong Arab presence in America ever since the beginning of the Conquest, and especially the physical participa tion of the Moors in the conquistadors' venture. It is also known that a large number of those who converted were really crypto-Jews and crypto-Moslems fleeing the repression following the fall of Granada, and seeking exile in faraway lands. Tempting fate by joining Christopher Columbus on his adventure they perhaps har bored the secret desire of settling in Moslem lands, given the feet that Columbus was planning to go to the Far East. Recent historical re search, such as that of Emilio Harth-Terre, points out that Moorish women also took part on the journey, and not necessarily as conquis tadors' consorts—furtive immigration is indeed an ancient phenomenon. In addition to bearing children In the New World, they also left their cultural mark there. Among the large diversity of threads that weave Mexican identity together is the Arab-Islamic influence stemming from Andalusian stock. Though not the most important one, its presence is by no means negligible and endows Mexican culture with a Mudejar dimension. After all, could it be mere coincidence that the Virgin of Guadalupe, who lies at the origin of Mexican religious syncretism, has an Arabic name? To better understand the meaning of this her itage it is important to think about the meaning of Mudejar. Undoubtedly a word of Arabic ori gin, the inaccurate etymology for Mudejar of fered by some Spanish dictionaries and studies on the topic indicate it is derived from mud dayyan, a word which does not mean one who is pious as it implies, but instead one who has be come a believer, one who has been converted in to a believer. (The fervent believer is the mutad dayin.) It is much more likely that the Spanish term is derived from mudaggan, from the verb daggana originally used for animals, which means to domesticate, subdue or tame. So that the noun derivative mudaggan—in Spanish the "an" ending is changed into "ar," much more common in Castilian toponyms and proper names—refers to one who is domesti cated, who submits or conforms of one's own free will, but also to one who protects oneself. In medieval Spain, the term Mudejar referred to the Moors living under Christian rule after the Reconquest of lands formerly occupied by Moslems. Mudejars were allowed to remain on Christian territory and conserve their religion and traditions. The use of the word appears to date back to the thirteenth century, though it on ly seems to appear in written documents begin ning in the fourteenth century, its usage be coming more widespread in the centuries that followed. Later, with the fall of Granada and the suppression of religious freedom, Mudejars became Moriscos, i.e. Moors converted to Christianity by force. A Mudejar work in the broadest sense of the term, Don Quijote was written at the time of the expulsion of the Moriscos and alludes to the different terms used to designate them: "in Barbary the Moors of Aragon are called Tagarins, those of Granada Mudejars, and in the kingdom of Fez Mudejars are called elches." According to historian Leopoldo Torres Balbás, if we were to adhere to the strictest historical mean ing of the term. Mudejar would designate the art of Moslems who lived on Christian soil during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But over a century ago, when it was accepted by the Royal Spanish Academy, the term was already used in a much more extensive manner to in clude any artwork created on Christian territo ry which bore traces of Islamic influence. In the majority of cases, these works are anonymous and the religion of their creators is therefore unknown. Not all were made by Mudejars in the strict sense of the word, but also by Christians influenced by Islamic art. The rapid spread of Christianization makes it difficult to distinguish what is actually Mudejar from Moorish, in the same way that it is hard to draw the line be tween early Mudejar and late Mozarabic art— that of Christians living on Moslem territory who were allowed to keep practicing their reli ♦ s 5 ♦ OUMAMA AOUAD LAHRECH Lorna Scott Fox.</page><page sequence="6">gion. In any case, the abrupt change in religion and political regime did not imply a systematic change in aesthetics. However, we should mention that the Mudejars benefited from a peculiar phenomenon of transference of the Moslem legal system, based on respect of reli gious freedom, and were thus in a comparable situation to that of the Mozarabs who were pro tected by Moslem law. Recognition of monothe istic religions is a fundamental principle of Islam. In the Koran, a type of social, political and religious contract known as the dimma is estab lished, according to which the Moslem state grants protection and freedom of worship to the "People of the Book," i.e. Jews and Christians, as long as the latter recognize Moslem political authority. In short, what we call Mudejar art today includes works influenced by Islamic art, made in Iberian Christian territories as well as works made by Hispanic Mudejars in America. We understand Mudejar to refer more to culture than to ethnicity and as a bicultural or transcul tural phenomenon. Interrupted by political conquests at home, the religious exchange between the three cultures prevailing in Spain spread across the Atlantic, flourishing subversively through art. In Amer ican territories conquered by Spain, the Mudejar influence as a projection of Andalusian values found its highest artistic expression in architec ture; however, I will leave it up to art and archi tecture specialists to demonstrate this; for my part I will take the route that I am most familiar with— that of thought and literature. In Mexico, a country that has always been open to foreign influences, Arab-Moslem aesthetics were incorporated into the already widespread mestization. The Mudejar imprint in contempo rary Mexican culture is a synthesis of the exten sive ethnic and cultural syncretism that oc curred in Spain. Let us not forget that in the Iberian peninsula, the Arab-Berbers did not make a clean sweep of the pre-lslamic past. Rather, they incorporated and assimilated it, and even recovered a large part of its forgotten Greco-Latin heritage. To catalog all the traces of Arab-Islamic influence in Mexican culture today is an inconceivable proj ect How could one separate Arabic and Moslem lineages from the complicated and tan gled plot of Mexican history? After centuries of cultural and racial Christian and Semitic inter mixing in Andalusia, only reminiscences remain within the various layers of Mexican memory, distinguished by its extraordinary capacity for assimilating and integrating the most diverse el ements. Any Moroccan or Maghrebi traveler who visits Mexico will experience a vague familiarity with some of the sociocultural values and traditions in architecture, food, social and family relation ships, etc. At the same time, to the Mexican eye the strangeness of faraway Arab and African countries will be mitigated by the recognition of certain similarities and affinities. Rooted in a long, shared history, this common background is the legacy of Andalusian civilization. Mexican writers who have caught a glimpse of the Arab world were dazzled by the relationships hidden in the depths of collective memory. To fill the gaps of labyrinthine history, they uncov ered their shared roots, recovering the forgot ten memory of their Arabic-Andalusian her itage. Meeting and exploring this prestigious past has inspired many great Mexican artists, thinkers and writers. Luis Barragán, Leopoldo Zea, Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Ruiz Dueñas and Alberto Ruy Sánchez, among oth ers, transcend the known, recognized cultural horizons not for the sake of exoticism but be cause they consider themselves heirs to the An dalusian tradition. Who better than the architect Barragán to have recovered the Hispano-Arabic influence in Mexican art? The discovery of An dalusia and the Islamic world—Morocco, Turkey, etc.—awakened a passion in him for Arabic ar chitecture and inspired his Mudejar works. Questioning the roots and endurance of Mex ican Mudejarism, Leopoldo Zea, Octavio Paz and Carlos Fuentes coincide in highlighting the Andalusian legacy's obvious sources, beyond the inherent differences in their ideologies. In their historic exploration they wonder why the fruitful encounter of ethnic groups and cul tures that makes Latin America a melting pot of races, is not as apparent in Anglo-Saxon America, caught up in the woes of racism. Their answer is that the assimilating capacity that characterizes Mexico in particular and Latin-American cul tures in general is derived from the historic ex perience of the coexistence of multiple cul tures and ethnicities in Moslem Spain during 800 years. Concurring with Américo Castro, the first Spanish historian to recognize the importance of the Semitic legacy in the configuration of Spanish identity—thereby palliating the nearsightedness of many Spanish intellectuals—Zea and Paz point out the Moslem sentiment of the conquest un dertaken by Christian Spain. A paradox that in reality reflects the profound Mudejarism of the conquistadors whose objective, unlike that of their Anglo-Saxon counterparts, was not limit ed to merely occupying the lands they had in vaded. Like the Moslem conquest of Spain, the Spanish conquest of America implied the con version or evangelization of conquered peoples. In Tiempo nublado, Paz clarifies that at the root of this politico-religious philosophy, inherited from long centuries of coexistence with Islam, Spanish territories in America were not strictly colonies but viceroyships subordinate to the Span ish Crown. He explains the politics of integra tion and inclusion of the Indians in the follow ing terms; "Unlike their English, Dutch and French rivals, the Spaniards and Portuguese were dominated by Islam for centuries. But to speak of domination is deceiving; the splendor of the Hispano-Arabic civilization still surprises us and these centuries of struggle were also about intimate coexistence." However, while Paz emphasizes the positive as pects of the Mudejar legacy in Mexico, he also touches on its darker side, which includes the phenomenon of caciquism common in Latin American countries where mestization took place between the indigenous and Hispano Arabic cultures. According to the poet, in Mexico, the heroic image of the Hispano-Arabic political boss was superimposed upon the ritual image of the Aztec priest-king. It is the sacro sanct figure of the Father which embodies all powerful political authority, immutable within the Mexican psyche. As Paz understands it, this phenomenon has a twofold negative repercussion, lying at the root of the conflicting relationships between men and women and of the problematic issue of paternal ism poisoning Mexican political life. Until recent ly, in Mexico as in all patriarchal societies, the role of women was reduced to masculine whim, be it good or bad. Christianity and Islam, both pa triarchal religions, seem to determine the situation of Mexican and Latin-American women, a legacy of the way women's roles were tradi tionally conceived in Spain. Octavio Paz is probably the Mexican essayist who has most exhaustively explored the Hispanic Arabic-Moslem heritage in Mexico in reference to politics, ethics, aesthetics and eroti cism. He deals with the latter in La llama doble: "Courtly love is inconceivable without Arabic eroticism. Civilizations are not fortresses but rather intersecting roads and our debt to Arabic culture, in this sense, is enormous." Indeed, the first story of passionate love which led to a series of great literary myths such as Tristan and Isolde, Abelard and Héloïse, and Romeo and Juliet, took place in the deserts of the Yemen towards the end of the twelfth century. Majnun and Layla (majnun literally meaning "demented one")—which inspired the great Surrealist poet Louis Aragon to write Le Fou d'Eisa—was the title of the original story whose diverse literary incarnations would become known worldwide. Centuries before, the Arabic and Islamic Orient understood love in a way that Westerners would only discover during the Middle Ages through troubadours from Provence: an idealized, sublime love, an ab solute, eternal feeling which transcends death, and a search for a complementary otherness. Western and especially Hispanic lyric poetry owe a lot to Arabic lyric poetry as far as both subject matter and metrics are concerned. Paz confesses to having experienced the influence of Arabic literature early on in life: images from an Andalusian-Arabic poetry book that he read as a teenager made a lasting impression on him. The case of Moslem and Spanish mysticisms, both influenced by the language and spirit of courtly love, is perhaps one of the most interest ing aspects of this intercultural exchange. Courtly love in the Arabic sense has an un doubtedly mystical dimension, brilliantly illus trated by the Hispano-Arabic mystic Ibn al Arabi of Murcia. ♦ s 6 ♦</page><page sequence="7">Like other Far-Eastern cultures and unlike Christianity—in which the concepts of guilt and the original sin foment chastity and a certain aversion to sexuality—, Islam does not dissociate the sensual from the religious in the pages of its holy book. In colonial Mexico, the texts of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz illustrate the confluence of sacred and profane love, and as such the continued influ ence of medieval Spanish mysticism's spirit of courtly love. While poets who wrote odes to idealized love invent romantic language—or rein vent it: let us not forget The Song of Songs then mystics appropriate this language to trans late their own experiences. In the texts of St. Teresa of Ávila, St. John of the Cross and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, themes, motifs and sym bols characteristic of courtly love and Sufi mysti cism appear: the rose, the prison of love, the bird, the eye... erotic language making the reader doubt at times whether to interpret the texts literally or metaphorically. Presently, there are more and more Mexican writers who, from a literary perspective, try to look at Mexico through the lens of Arabic Andalusian memory. All that is Arabic consti tutes an important theme in the tales of Jorge Ruiz Dueñas, author of Las noches de Salé. These lyrical and somewhat fictitious chronicles of a voyage through Moroccan geography and his tory reveal a profound and fraternal knowl edge of my country's and my native city's real ity, which continue to inspire the author who, in his own words, "has a place for Morocco in (his) heart." Struggling to preserve Arabic roots as a living legacy, Alberto Ruy Sánchez occupies a place of his own. With the objective of "recovering Arabic influences as a hidden aspect of Mexico's past," as he says, he introduces new and inter esting perspectives around the concept of "lat eral Orientalism." Bridging the gap between Arabic and Mexican cultures, Ruy Sánchez portrays Mexico as "a western face with Aztec and Moorish streaks," to quote the poet Ramón López Velarde. Filled with Aztec and Arab-Moslem images and cross bred symbols—such as the snail and the spiral, the serpent and the bird, water and air, the spider and the ocean—his stories are steeped in a deep literary Mudejarism. Not unlike an arti san, the writer is inspired by the geometry of Arabic tiles in constructing the design of his "novels" or, better said, narrative poems. An impassioned reader of Arabic literature, Ruy Sánchez places his first novel under the sign of Ibn Hazm, a leading exponent of the art of love. The Ring of the Dove, a true bible of love and a master work of the multifaceted eleventh-century Cordobán poet, thinker, politician and theologian, is a notable source of inspiration for Ruy Sánchez and the characters of Mogadon Numerous passages of this novel and of Los labios del agua echo the texts of Sufi mystics like Ibn al-Arabi or al-Ghazali. "The lat eral Orientalism" that Sánchez advocates pre supposes the exploration of a double other ness: the Arabic and the feminine. Arabic women, the main protagonists of Mogador, are portrayed from the intimacy of their most se cret desires. His writing bereft of the slightest trace of exoticism, the author knew how to avoid falling into the trap of the male gaze. Far from the Western male vision which perceives Arab women as mere objects of desire and fan tasy, Fatma in Mogador is, above all, a desiring subject. In conclusion, Arab-Moslem "otherness" is not only external but internal, an essential compo nent of Mexican identity. In the words of Ruy Sánchez, "the cultural history uniting Mexico and Morocco—both countries being offshoots of Arabic-Andalusian culture—allows us to dis cuss a cultural frontier that should be explored, whether to break through it or break it down." The Spain of Andalusian origins, the Orient of the West, prepares Mexican writers and poets for a fruitful encounter with the Arabic and Islamic Orient. This profound Mexican Mudejarism is what al lows us to build cultural bridges between the two shores of the Atlantic, bringing closer together what geography separated. How paradoxical is the Mudejar! Classified as ephemeral art because it was made of fragile materials—chalk, clay, mud, lime—, art of modest architects, a circumstan tial expression without pretensions, the Mudejar has allowed for the perpetuation of Moslem-Arabic memory in Christian lands. Merging with Hispanic Christian culture, it be came indestructible. Fragile and eternal Mudejar! À. Translated by Elena Shtromberg. THE VERTEX RECONCEIVED FOR A LATERAL ORJEnTALJSm ALBERTO RUY SÁNCHEZ The cultural history uniting Mexico and Mo rocco—both countries being offshoots of Ar abic-Andalusian culture—allows us to discuss a cultural frontier that should be explored, whether to break through it or to break it down. The vicissitudes of life led me to a place where I could see and touch that frontier. This fortuitous encounter permitted me to describe it and to venture onto it as had never been done in Mexican literature. At this frontier I saw a broader cultural bridge than all those connect ing us with the Anglo-Saxon, Protestant cul ture of the United States. I have been explor ing the Arab-Andalusian bridge for several years. There is no exoticism involved in my quest—unless it is considered exotic to search for some unexpected element that we all carry within ourselves. Is the purpose of literature not to seek out new ways of exploring the ter ritory of the indescribable? Is it not the nature of literature to explore frontiers, limits, life's possibilities? The notion that a particular literature may be de termined by geography alone—or even worse, by geopolitics—is entirely alien and even offen sive to me. Does literature have borders? Is it not in its nature to transgress the limits of knowledge, thus revealing dimensions of life beyond the reach of other disciplines? How is a literature's iden tity formed? Is it the past or the present that counts? The past leaves its mark on the present but is also reinvented by the present. We are the children of multiple pasts as well as of our own time. And literature explores that dynamic: it is not the passive receptor of what came be fore but rather a penetrating gaze with a 180 degree range. Is Mexican literature produced only by writers with a Mexican passport or those who reside in the country? Why is the work of Alvaro Mutis and Augusto Monterroso—who have lived here longer than I have—not considered Mexican lit erature? Would Mutis not merit inclusion in both Colombian and Mexican literature, and Monterroso in that of both Guatemala and Mex ico? Why must they be forced to relinquish one of their identities? Both authors have broken through their personal frontiers and no socie ty has the right to make anyone to surrender the identities one acquires throughout life. Some claim that a writer's true territory is lan guage. As if multiple languages could not coexist within an individual. Why give up "living" more than one language? Literature and art are pro duced by individual creators with unique histo ries. We can then group these individuals ac cording to generalizations, but it is difference and not generalizations which defines the essence of their creativity. Neither language nor society write the work. A truly creative artist produces something exceptional and neither territory nor social identity, nor even language and cultural homeland can be the fundamental determining factors of his or her work. Each writer's life is a journey through familiar and unfamiliar frontiers—often involuntarily. This nec essarily leads me to wonder about my own fron tiers and those that lend my work its context. Each writer's life experience is what precisely defines his or her territories—irrespective of the passport or passports he or she may possess. I am a Mexican writer born around the mid-twen tieth century, in a city which could still be called "the most transparent region in the atmos phere." Nearly forty-eight years later, the air has been sullied as the city became seven or eight cities which obsessively continue to exist as a single one. My parents are Sonora natives of varied ances try though I am a Mexico City native by birth. I spent the first ten years of my life between Mexico City's Roma district and Sonora or Baja California. Everyone saw me as an outsider, but rather than feel like I didn't belong anywhere, I began to thinkthat I was from both places. Why forsake either of these identities if I had been marked by both? I spent my adolescence living a nearly rural exis tence with my family, just outside the town of Atizapán de Zaragoza in the State of México, on ♦ 87 ♦ Elena Shtromberg. ALBERTO RUY SÁNCHEZ</page><page sequence="8">the outskirts of Mexico City. During the latter years I attended school in the city. So to my two identities I added those of a child and teenager from a town which had become a suburb. This new relativity gave me a different perspective from that of my schoolmates, who had experi enced nothing beyond their own neighbor hood and the places where they vacationed. The third decade of my life took place in France. I followed a woman to Paris—Margarita, who is today my wife. The city became our primary territory, and little by little, its streets became our guiding lifeline. We learned to decipher the obvious as well as secret codes of a culture which—though not our own—we adopted with intense critical passion. So I added a French in fluence to the territories that determined my identity, and was subsequently criticized for it by a journalist with nationalistic leanings. Moreover, France opened up other spiritual ter ritories to us: its culture is a voracious assimila tion of large and small differences that enrich daily life. And it was during that decade of crossroads, end lessly multiplying frontiers and multiplying lan guages that I became a writer. During that de cade, among other things, I focused on discov ering my own narrative voice. My exploration of the dimension of desire in daily existence—that is, my attempt at comprehending and narrating it was a life adventure that was gradually trans formed into a body of work. Thus I constructed a new definition of my territory as a writer, stub bornly concerned as I was with understanding (insofar as it was possible) and with deciphering (within the limits of my gender) the universe of female desire in contrast with that of male de sire: the shifting, troubled terrain of bodies and how they are imagined. An entirely new adopt ed culture: the central territory of my litera ture. Besides Paris, our cities of choice were Siena in Italy and Essaouira in Morocco. Our contacts with these cities was vital, shorter but no less intense. Essaouira inspired Mogadon the imagi nary city, the city of desire where my novels take place. In Morocco I discovered a cultural territo ry that borders on my own: an alternate Mexico separated by many seas. But essentially, anoth er culture which was also an offshoot of eight centuries of Arab-Andalusian culture in Spain. For me, that cultural frontier was also a path in to the territory of desire. That is how certain painters have seen it "I try to paint the ad mirable poem that Is the human body," wrote Eugène Delacroix during his sojourn in Morocco from December 1831 to July 1832. And it is true that there is a basic bodily intensity governing the composition of his Orientalist paintings. He would once state that Arabic clothing in general is more closely connected to the body and na ture. And that is how he depicts it. Thus, the Orientalist opulence of female dress is not some thing superfluous but rather forms a part of the body itself. He notes that in many cases, "though the attire may be the same, the manner in which it is worn differs so much from person to person that it takes on a disconcertingly lovely and dignified quality." Delacroix paints the solar beauty of Arab women in their shadowy apartments. He contrasts that sense of peace with the bold, swift movements of horsemen which allow him to create a stampede of color. In one work, with the eye of an impassive ob server, he captures the noble pride of a defeat ed sultan and his court. Finally, he is profound ly moved by the spectacle of ritual Sufi dancers entering a state of ecstasy in the streets of Tangiers. Synthesized in Delacroix's work is the signifi cance of nineteenth-century Orientalist art as a sensual aesthetic of desire, the awed discovery of other cultures and a liberal affirmation. Three vital drives still prevalent today because they are still necessary. But they can only remain visibly alive in a different form: within a contemporary aesthetic that takes into account the already classic ruptures of twentieth-century avant-garde movements. An aesthetic which is also conscious of the fact that we can break the historic and cultural North-South axis by which Delacroix and other nineteenth-century Orientalists steered their course. Today we can approach the Moslem Orient aesthetically from South to South. Jacques Berque, a renowned scholar in the field of Arabic studies, states that Arabism is a way of life as well as an affective sign that asserts itself and prevails over the objectivity of geographers and historians. Arabist Orientalism is greater than the vast domains of Islam: it extends from An dalusia to Indonesia by way of the African and Asian steppes, the Punjab, Bengal, and so forth. And it is an affective sign insofar as it continues to grow steadily in our consciousness until it reach es our shores: until it reaches the shores of our skin. At the close of the twentieth century Mexico found itself in a privileged position with respect to the Orient and in particular to the Maghreb—that is, the western Orient. For at that very time, on both sides of the world, there was an emerging awareness that close cultural ties could be formed without them necessarily passing through Europe. In other words, it is conceivable that there be a Mexican view of the Arabic Orient or an Oriental view of Mexico not based on the verticality of the European per spective—with all its advantages and disadvan tages. It is possible to develop a reciprocal vision which— though never disregarding the history that gave rise to it—acknowledges the many features of a present-day shared culture, and based on those features, constructs broader cultural bridges for the future. The idea, then, is to construct an Orientalism that is not only clearly lateral but which flews in two directions. Because in the new globalized world order—in a complete reversal of the status quo—Mexico's cultural diversity and artistic creativity have made it a kind of Orient of the old Orient. If the word Maghreb itself means "west" and Morocco thus constitutes the East's Far West, Mexico is also its own continent's Far West America's last and richest cultural extravagance. A fertile lateral Orientalism has begun to de velop in the eyes of certain Moroccan authors who have written about Mexico and its culture. Particularly noteworthy is the writer from Salé, Oumama Aouad Lahrech, who offers reflections on the poetic horizon shared by present-day Mexico and Morocco, nations which share the heritage of al-Andalus. Furthermore, Moroccan travelers to Mexico are invariably struck by the many geographic similarities between that two countries. And this common geography allows them to see more clearly the racial, historical and cultural backgrounds which we share. Anyone who observes first-hand the astonishing physical resemblance between Mexicans and Mo roccans quickly realizes that the myth that Mexicans are the product of a Spanish and in digenous racial blend is at best a partial explana tion. And that by way of our Spanish ancestors we have much more Arabic-Andalusian blood than we had always thought. It is even possible that the mythic Mexican idea that our dark skin is entirely and exclusively due to our indigenous heritage is false and that many people of the so called "race of bronze" owe the tanned beauty of their skin to the first waves of Spanish im migration into Mexico, whose ethnic origins lie in the lands where most of the population was Arabic during the eight centuries prior to the conquest of America. No less mythical, the labyrinthine nature of Mex icans also merits reexamination, including the Arabic component of our culture. Anyone who experiences it first-hand will also recognize that the average Mexican mestizo's attitude, cultur al mentality and use of gestural language has perhaps more in common with those of Maghrebis than with those of Spaniards or in digenous Mexicans. Regarding written and spo ken language, Antonio Alatorre states in his book Los mil y un años de la lengua española that some forty percent of the words commonly used in Mexico are of Arabic origin. What more definitive aspect of culture than language? At once resistant and adaptable, over the cen turies, language absorbs and conveys what we are. It is the barometer for our intermixing. It is always more organic than the policies that con trol or attempt to control it It has grown to in corporate, whether we like it or not, irreplace able Náhuatl words and even Anglicisms from our latest empire—which may not prevail as long as we might think. If forty percent of our language derives from the Arabic, might we not be Arabs to a similar de gree—a distant and seldom acknowledged ele ment, but just as real? Many generations of Mex icans have grown up disregarding this cultural and genetic component of our identity. We are ac customed to such ignorance, partly due to the myth of Spanishness, which created a false con struct of racial purity following the Reconquest ♦ s s ♦</page><page sequence="9">of Spain. Arid New Spain was heir to that mythology, with its symbolic and real crusade against the heathens of the Christianized world. How, then, do we acknowledge our own hea then culture and the heathen blood in our veins? It is impossible. On the contrary, indige nous converts had to be assimilated by placing them imaginarily rising up in arms against non-be lievers. Fortunately, mestization finally prevailed over all real and symbolic wars. The Arabic el ement flows in our veins, surfacing where we least expect it. Mexican crafts display traces of a deeply-rooted Arabic influence, evident in materials such as the glazed ceramics from Puebla known as Talavera—a technique originating in the village of Talavera de la Reina near Toledo, which was Arabic territory In Spain. The roots of this tech nique tradition which we consider to be gen uinely Mexican are undeniably Spanish and be fore that Andalusian—and stretch even further back to Persia and China. But even certain crafts that our contemporary mythology would like to think of as one-hundred percent Mexican such as the indigenous textiles of Chiapas—bear traces of Maghrebian culture. In the first cen turies of evangelization, Mayan weavers assimi lated techniques and designs from Spanish mis sionaries, many of whom were from Extremadura and southern Spain where the Arabic influence was and is very strong in artisanal designs and techniques. Indeed, indigenous textiles even dis play Berber patterns mixed with classic Mayan ones, and contemporary textiles from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia bear a striking resemblance to those of Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. Even the use of wool on the American continent where sheep were not endemic is a vestige of cultural blending. Despite all the cultural differences between the Arabic Orient and Mexico, there emerges a com mon thread visible to those who have the op portunity to experience it or the tenacity to search for it—and also the sensitivity to discov er it. But it is important to avoid turning the perception or creation of that common thread in to a nostalgic yearning for times past. It should rather be viewed as a future in the process of becoming. The creative challenge consists partly of recog nizing oneself in that which is foreign. But more to the point, it lies in discovering a new narrative voice which speaks about life saying things that can only be said using elements of the artistic language provided by this common cultural thread, this frontier that literature has turned into a bridge. Writing about the life of what Delacroix called the "admirable poem that is the human body"—with its magnetic attraction toward oth er bodies and the dreams generated by that at traction—is, in my view, the challenge of this new lateral Orientalism. An extended Orientalism which ventures to explore a body that could be from either of the two Orients and bears a closer resemblance to Courbet's vi sion of the female body in The Origin of the World. A painting whose origins do not lie in Orientalism, but which for that very reason may be adopted by this new sensibility; a paint ing in which a female pubis smiles placidly at the viewer, like someone whose dreams are haunted by his or her most vital ghosts. The admirable poem of the human body also involves divulging the inner poem of one's dreams: sexual bodies seen not from the out side but from within, through the eyes of each lover. Not the external gaze of vertical, pos sessive desire, but the internal and external gaze of a lateral, desiring geometry which is aware of frontiers. Perhaps literature serves to demonstrate that each individual is unique; that each common frontier is shared in a very different way; that identity is a construction, as is its network of frontiers, and that frontiers are something we constantly shift from one place to another—both in our collective history and in individual histories. A Translated by Michelle Suderman. THE VERTEX DEFINED THE nAmES OF JSLAmJC ART LEÓN R. ZAHAR Arabic: The initial designation of this artistic tradition as Arabic was a rash overstatement based on studies of Arabic language and litera ture. This approach is also found in often racial classifications of civilizations, such as the pio neering work by Gustave Le Bon, La Civilization arabe (1860). Inevitably, the same trend was fol lowed in the first museums and academic insti tutes in Europe and the semi-colonized Moslem world. In Egypt, the British founded the Muse um of Arabic Art, while in Algeria, the French realized inventories of Arabic monuments. Meanwhile in Spain—whose Moslem past was revived by the Orientalists—the first Arab insti tutes appeared. During the same period, Oliver Hurtado's Granada y sus monumentos árabes (1874), Prisse de Avennes' La Décoration arabe (1879) and Albert Gayet's L'Art arabe (1893) were published. Nineteenth-century academic circles reached the apparently logical and universal—if simplistic conclusion that equated language, ethnicity, civ ilization and art. However, a revision allowed for the fact that was not long before a revision was taken on: Gothic art was not created by the Goths and Islamic art was not created by the Arabs. In 1818, the architect Huyot—who was drawing up plans of Arabic monuments in Egypt informed that, "the Arabs are inspired by Egyptians and Greeks as they are not familiar with cities apart from their encampments, nor with houses other than their tents." Historians and archaeologists thus began to speak of Persian, Turkish or Berber art as opposed to an Arabic tradition. But who better qualified to explain the art of the Arabs than the great fourteenth-century Maghrebian historian Ibn Jaldun, whose work Los prolegómenos had been rediscovered by the Orientalists. He writes, "As the customs of nomadic life are deeply rooted among the Arabs, they have distanced themselves from the arts. After the [Moslem] conquest, they adapted themselves to the con structions left by other peoples [...] and the arts were established in the Orient over many cen turies, under the rule of Persians, Nabataeans, Copts, Israelis, Greeks, Romans and other an cient peoples." It would be erroneous to sup pose that classical Arabic's status as the schol arly language in medieval Islamic civilization meant those who used it were Arabs and by ex tension, that their art was Arabic. This Is the equivalent of speaking of a Latin culture simply for the use of Latin in medieval Europe, thus denying it roots from the French, English, Castilian and Portuguese cultures. Chueca Goitia concludes that "this so-called Arabic spirit has frequently been attributed to all things done by the Islamized peoples under their new faith, including those accomplishments which evidently found inspiration in their own national traditions." Marcel Dieulafoy empha sizes the Persian component in Islamic art: "Persia [has been] the inspiration of Moslem ar chitecture and [by extension] for Mudejar archi tecture in Spain." Oleg Grabar, with his charac teristic prudence, recognizes that "more then any other aesthetic, Byzantine art [...] con tributed to the creation of an Islamic tradi tion." mosLEm: The term Moslem art—comparable to Christian art—appears towards the end of the nineteenth century as a learned alternative to Arabic. Lectures on the Religion of the Semites (1889), a comparative study of the two religions with essays by Hegel, Muller and William Robert son, emphasizes religion as the nucleus of civi lization and the inspiration for its art Significantly, the first major international exhibition on the subject (Paris, 1893) was entitled Exhibition of Mos lem Art, rather than Arabic art. Manuel d'art musulman by Gaston Migeon was released in 1907, while in 1927 another text with the same title was published by Georges Marcais, author of L'Architecture musulmane d'Occident (1954). In Spain, the term Hispano-Moslem art became widespread. In some encyclopaedias and art his tories Mohammedan was used as a synonym for Moslem. However, this designation was prompt ly discarded as incorrect, given that Mohammed was merely a scribe writing the words told him by God, one cannot speak of a Mohammedan re ligion in the same sense as Zoroastrian or Chris tian. Also, to equate Arabic with Moslem is as ab surd as taking Japanese to be a synonym for Buddhist. JSLAmJC: Around 1930, the term Islamic took precedence in Germanic and Anglo-Saxon aca demic circles, in particular. Considered the most appropriate of terms, or at least the most neu tral, Islamic takes into account the ethnic diver sity of the Moslem world as well as the variations in religious emphasis. The influential journals Ars Islamica, Revue des Etudes Islamiques and Studia ♦ s 9 ♦ LEÓN R. ZAHAR</page><page sequence="10">Islámico highlight this understanding of the term. The 1960s saw the publication of works on Islamic civilization by authors such as Hodgson, Von Grunnebaum and Bernard Lewis. Oleg Grabar published Islamic Art and Its Decoration in 1964. In a later work, The Formation of Islamic Art, he af firms that "the qualifier Islamic—even applied to art—goes further than do the terms Christian, Buddhist or Hindu in the sense of religious depth and further than Gothic or baroque insofar as style is concerned. In reality, the word embraces a civilization [...] in which the majority of the population, or at least the ruling class, professes the Islamic faith." Implicitly agreeing with Ibn Jaldun, Grabar emphasizes that only this quali fier—referring to a civilization and not just to the religion—may extend to the diverse ethnic ities and religions which, while living under Islamic rule, are neither Moslem nor Arabic: Copts, Syro-Aramaics, Persians, Mozarabs, Moors, Berbers, Jews, Christians, Turks, Indians and Mongols who are the true anonymous cre ators of Islamic art. In Islamic Architects and Their Works (1956), Mayer concludes that the Islamic tradition included "a great number of masters who were not Moslem but used names that did not reveal their religion. This is the case of three architects who oversaw the construction of the Medina Azahara during the tenth century. Two of them were Aramaic and the other Egyptian, but they used Arabic names as a mark of their status as Moslem converts. Even the Islamophile Titus Burckhardt recog nizes that Islamic art cannot be categorized as Moslem, because the Koran is not its source of inspiration. HibPAno-Arabic: Islamic art in Spain also had its ups and downs, though with the added matter of nationalism. During the Renaissance, these works were characterized as barbarisms left behind by the Mauretanians or Moors. In the nineteenth century, when the first histories of Spanish art were written, they were viewed as vestiges of for eign rulers, distant and undesirable. Later, they were classified as Arabic, following the tenden cies among French academia. However, in the early twentieth century, Spanish historians and archaeologists began to speak of Hispano-Arabic, Hispano-Moorish or Arabic-An dalusian art, with the clear aim of assimilating the tradition into the national culture. This was a period in which Spain colonized parts of North ern Africa and began to feel pride in the caliphate of Cordova. With the problem of ideology re solved, another matter arose: the term Hispano Arabic turned out to be unacceptable in that the authentically Arabic element had an only mar ginal presence in Spain. Only a handful of fami lies that could trace their roots back to the me dieval nobility could also prove Arabic descent— generally claiming a relation to Mohammed. A census of Moslem Granada in 1311 established that of the 200 000 inhabitants, only 500 were pure Arabs. In any case, as both Rafael López Guzmán and Fernando de Marías affirm, the ideal would be "to recover a historical terminology, taken from contemporary documents and texts." In this sense, there is no justification to retroactive ly impose a poorly understood Arabic identity onto Moslem Spain. In the sixteenth century, Juan de Valdés had no difficulty in distinguishing Moorish culture from the Arabic language: "As for those things we borrow from the Moors, we have no words with which to name them except the Arabic." The Moslem inhabitants of al-Andalus, then, did not identify themselves ethnically as Arabs. Ibn Jaldun called the Moslem territory Hispania or Spain, and the Moors defined themselves as Moslems, Andalusians, Sevillians, and so forth. The terms Moor, Moorish and Morisco were used by Christians to allude to a mestizo popula tion as demonstrated by a passage from the fif teenth century Cancionero castellano (Castilian songbook): "they come from all languages: Coros, Guineans, Turks, Armenians, Hebrews, Arabs and Chaldeans." To them must also be added the aboriginal population of the Iberian Peninsula, whether or not they had converted to Islam (elches or renegades), which made up the largest segment of mestizo Spain, where the Arabic language—deformed into countless di alects—was not able to take hold, just as Persian never caught on in Moslem India. For proof of this, one need only recall the ease with which Arabic was erased from Andalusia and the rela tive scarcity of Arabic vocabulary assimilated by Castilian Spanish—however distorted. HjsPAno-iTlosLEm: Spanish art historians—in keeping with international academic debates discarded the term Hispano-Arabic in favor of Hispano-Moslem or Hispano-Moorish. José Pijoan opted for Islamic art (Summa Artis, 1949) although he proposes—based on dubious etymology—the term Saracen art in the chapter dedicated to Egypt and Syria. Also, he hesitantly refers to the caliphal artistic phase in Moslem Spain as Arabic, while he uses Islamic in reference to post-caliphal art. Henri Terrasse prefers the terms Hispano Moorish and Hispano-Moslem. Leopoldo Torres Balbás and Basilio Pavón opt for the second in their respective works, El arte hispano-musul mán en su decoración geométrica and El arte his pano-musulmán en su decoración floral (both 1973). Currently, however, the term Islamic is still the prevalent term in Spain, giving rise to the no tion of a Hispano-lslamic art comparable to the Indo-lslamic tradition; in India, as in Spain, an Islamic sub-style was established with strong influ ence from local artistic traditions. ITIudejaR: Beginning in the nineteenth century, Spanish art historians did not hesitate to claim the existence of a Mudejar art unique to their na tion. Amador de los Ríos defined it in 1859 as "the style which was given life by Mudejar vas sals" and proposed a Morisco sub-style in ref erence to artistic production from the end of Islamic rule in Spain to the definitive expulsion of the Moriscos (Moslems converted to Christianity) in the seventeenth century. However, Torres Balbás rejects this distinction and considers the two terms to be synonymous, "in that the abrupt change in religion did not imply an artistic shift." The category of Mudejar is the equivalent of the term Arabic art in that it places the emphasis on ethnicity, but this is mitigated by its nationalistic conno tations. Like Islamic art, as defined by Grabar, religion is an influential factor in the Mudejar— though not the most determining one. Without questioning the national character of the Mudejar artistic phenomenon, Spanish historians are still debating as to whether or not it can tru ly be considered a style in its own right. Some dwell on the Islamic echoes in Gothic or Ren aissance works, thus giving rise to denominations such as Gothic-Mudejar or Romanesque brick work. The marquis of Lozoya noted that "strictly speaking, the collection of Moorish structures on the peninsula does not constitute a style, although it is the most characteristic manifestation of His panic art." Menéndez y Pelayo emphasized Mudejar's national spirit as "the only uniquely Spanish art we can be proud of," and Basilio Pavón concluded that it is, "in short, a nation al art form with aspirations to becoming a na tional style." At the other extreme, Georges Marcais claims Mudejar is a continuation of Hispano-Moslem art, whose history "did not end in 1492 with the fall of Granada; [...] prior to its disappear ance, this art form continued along a new course for more than a century, under the name of Mudejar." Torres Balbás ably summed up the debate in suggesting that this style "em braces all the aesthetic manifestations pro duced in Christian territories that bore the marks of an Islamic past. [...] The few works whose history is known to us are in some cas es attributed to subjugated Moors—that is, Mudejar people—and in others, to Spanish Christians influenced by Islamic art; on occa sion, they are identified as being the work of foreign artists (Moslems) residing on the peninsula." The debate surrounding Mudejar art today is centered more on the classification of monu ments and on determining the probable date of its demise. While some authors assume it be came extinct by the seventeenth century after the expulsion of the Moors, Chueca Goitia and Leopoldo Torres Balbás maintain that some mode of Mudejarism survived as a constant in the Spanish aesthetic, and made its final come back in Latin American and Spanish baroque forms. Torres Balbás notes, "Well-rooted in the popular soul, this Mudejarism persisted for centuries, scarcely affected by the multiple artistic transformations taking place around it, [...] never sacrificing its characteristic decora tive richness, ornamental profusion and violent polychromy, and cultivating a distaste for all that is classical and harmonious, as it waited for the right moment to present itself as a new baroque style." Reo-JTIudejaR: Amid nineteenth- and twen tieth-century eclecticism, which had such a pro found impact on Latin America, we find a firmly ♦ 90 ♦</page><page sequence="11">established neo-Gothic expression—to avoid re ferring to it as a style—to which the neo-Mudejar could be said to correspond. This denomination is owed to the fact that these nineteenth-century buildings were modeled after Hispano-Moslem architecture such as La Alhambra, or Mudejar structures like the Alcázar in Seville. This is the case of the smoking rooms that evoke the qubbas of the Alcázar or the Patio de los Leones. The alternate denomination of neo-Arabic may be explained by the fact that the term was still in vogue when these buildings were erected, al though the term had already been discarded in academic circles. By virtue of the imaginative artistic expressions which mix Islamic and Mudejar styles, perhaps a more neutral term would be Moorish. À,Translated by Jason Lange. A CONTRASTING VERTEX A COSJTUC BATTLE ALFONSO ALFARO How CAn we break open the celestial vault so that for a brief instant, divine grace may rain down from it? How can we momentarily re peal the laws of life - freighted with menace and death -, suspend the suffocating pettiness of everyday drudgery, open the floodgates of longing a crack so as to experience, just for a few seconds, an infinite hope? By means of the din that deafens and liberates; the drumming of the sappers, the blaring trum pets of the Zouaves that can, as at Jericho, bring down the walls of human time. By means of the haze of gunpowder that mingles with that of the clouds to create an atmosphere of unreality, in which sparks of hidden truth are seen to glim mer out. How may we give free rein to fantasy and make believe, abolish age and gender, relish the pleas ure of being someone else (nothing less than a hero, nothing less than a king)? By way of an embroidered costume, the loving handiwork of wife or mother, by way of glitter ing sequins carefully chosen on outings with work mates or shopping companions, by way of a shiny cloak that billows in the evening breeze, or a suit of armor worthy of some Amadis of Gaul reborn in the days of Robocop. How to become a man while remaining a woman, a knight without ceasing to be a child, a gallant youth in defiance of old age? Thanks to a false beard, a charcoal mustache, a wooden blunderbuss, a slashed doublet, some high-buttoned breeches. How to express the overwhelming trust and af fection felt toward a certain member of the do mestic clan who is so constant in his everyday presence, yet somewhat different from one's parents or siblings in view of the feet that he dwells primarily in the court of heaven (where he also happens to be the cousin of the Son of God)? Saint John the Baptist is the link that binds a group of people of different ages and walks of life into a genuine family: a brotherhood. The members of this fellowship, united by the sacred tie that makes them all kin to one another, spare no effort to keep this privileged relationship alive. What can they offer to Jesus's cousin and pre cursor, Mary's nephew, who has displayed such generosity toward his brothers here below, the brothers of his guild? The Holy Patron is not only rendered thanks and homage through deeds of fraternal charity, the practice of the sacraments, sincere repentance, or the forgiveness of offences; he is also invoked through group prayer, silent supplication, secret tears and overt rejoicing; in addition he is offered the smoke of candles and gunpowder, the bright hues of flowers and costumes, the aching of limbs after whole days of marching in the sun under the weight of exquisitely adorned knapsacks. He is invoked in the ordeal of those who drag them selves up the steep, stony slopes to his shrine on their knees. Saint John the Baptist looks kindly on the abstinence of those who have vowed to renounce liquor, on the solidarity of those who assist a person in the accomplishment of a prom ise, and on the largesse and courtesy of those who show hospitality to strangers. On the Bracho heights, on the outskirts of the city of Zacatecas, a celebration is held year af ter year that bears witness to the exuberant vi tality preserved by baroque Mexico to this day. This is a country lashed together by networks of solidarity, fond of common undertakings and shared merrymaking, quick to revel in luxury of texture and contrasts of color, preferring glit ter to comfort and choosing gifts freely given over the calculations of investment. Its inhabitants are adept at overthrowing—once the agreed hour has been struck by a bell or a cornet—the barriers between the visible and the invisible, for they are fully aware that these are merely different levels of a single reality, both equally operative. They do not disdain efficiency, yet they esteem generosity more; they admire integrity and tend to regard the pledges of the powerful and the virtues of human justice with a greater skepticism than they apply to the pal pable joys of the senses and the fundamental pacts entered into with more supernatural au thorities. This country is peopled by campesinos and doctors, mechanics and executives, artesans and shopkeepers, factory workers and house wives, teachers, soldiers and students, Mexicans from both sides of the Rio Grande (with and without a green cards). The fiesta begins with a tribute to the Preladita (Our Lady of Zacatecas) and carries on for the next four days, from Thursday night to Sunday evening, with a string of dramatic productions that dovetail into each other without becoming confused: the staging of three different tales set in three distinct periods, which nonetheless recount a single story. The program opens with a Colloquy about the beheading of John the Baptist performed in a purposely built arena with studied lighting and stage effects. Dozens of actors, young and old, form a colorful cast of princes and princesses, centurions and slaves. The plot, which takes the Gospel account as its starting point, has be come a landmark in the cultural memory of the West and a fount of inspiration for litera ture, painting and music, both sacred and pro fane. It describes the tragic episode in which Herod is so beguiled by Salome, the lovely daugh ter of Herodias, that he agrees to decapitate the holy man who reproved him for his adultery. This tale of passion and crime serves to high light the glorious purity of the Brotherhood's protector, in whose honor all these festivities are taking place. Whipped by the icy winds of a Zacatecan sum mer night, the performance unfolds before tiers of seats rudimentary enough to remind us of Les Bouffes du Nord, the Paris venue so dear to Peter Brook. And the involvement of the audi ence, the length of the spectacle (three sessions of three to four hours each), and the general indifference to the cold or the rain likewise re mind us of those interminable, captivating ses sions in which players from all over the world relived the history of time and the universe ac cording to the Hindu myths of the Mahabarata, after which it took weeks of asphalt and neon lights to shake us out of the bewitching illusion of that stage. Next morning and until early afternoon, the action decamps to the vast incline to one side of the chapel, near the tree that bears a plaque commemorating the visit of Pope John Paul II. This is the scene for the Colloquy concerning the Twelve Peers of France, a literary narrative di rectly descended from the medieval epic tradition. Charlemagne and his valiant knights are up against the bold cunning of Moslem warriors who are equally courageous, and mindful of the laws of honor. The Christians, however, prevail thanks to the treachery of a Moorish princess, Floripes, who has fallen in love with a Frankish knight. This triumph is thus one of the most gratifying imaginable, since it is the power of male se duction which ultimately decides the out come—the greatest possible victory in all the competitions that have ever pitted one man against another, whether on the summit of Mount Olympus or in a barrio backstreet. The denouement brings into explicit focus one of the essential themes of the great male narra tives of the West: courtly epic poetry and chivalry novels are packed with incidents that have held audiences of boys and old men spell bound for centuries, for they enact the role a thousand times rehearsed by every man in his secret fantasies. Here, the knight's reward is not just a beautiful damsel: it is the victory of his family line, his people and his feith, obtained against fierce and noble adversaries thanks to the radiant power of his manliness and gallantry. The enthusiasm with which the play is enacted today amid these arid escarpments demon strates the enduring vigor of one of the great constructs of Western culture—a literature that though it may be centuries old, and displaced to the heart of the American continent can let us feel a breath of medieval France, Europe's first ♦ 91 ♦ Jason Lange.</page><page sequence="12">nation and "first-born daughter" of the Church. The third dramatic piece requires an even bigger space. Now the stage includes all the hillsides around the encampments, dominated by a set of a castle that becomes taller every year. A cast, literally, of thousands (a single batallion of Zouaves numbers more than 800 men) acts out the struggles that racked Spain and the Med iterranean towards the end of the Moslem oc cupation of the Iberian peninsula, during the cen tury that stretched between the conquest of Gra- nada by the Catholic Kings (1492) and the expulsion of the Moriscos or Moorish converts (1609-1614). The context is that of the Alpujarras war, the raids of Berber pirates and the battle of Lepanto. Two of the main characters are Philip II and John of Austria (including a startling episode in which John is rescued from prison by the King, a yarn whose main purpose appears to be the exaltation of the monarch to the detriment of his rather too clever, handsome and popular bastard brother). After countless haughty challenges, flowery speeches, sword battles and troop charges, the Moorish forces begin to overcome the Christian armies. By evening on the second day, they have taken the fortress and imposed their rule. As night falls over the encampment, the crescent flag is fluttering from the top of the tower. The climate of the Moslem presence in Spain is well suggested by this to and fro between victo ry and defeat, along fronts that shifted slowly throughout the long-drawn-out Christian Reconquest. It is only on the next morning—following the parade through town, the Mass and the con clusion of the Twelve Peers of France drama— that the Christian forces gird themselves for a final offensive. Once more the two armies are fielded in their entirety, obeying a strictly or dered, spectacular choreography (in which the actors on the Christian side join to form an enormous cross with their bodies before launching the attack, just as the Moslems had made themselves into a giant crescent the night before). The advances in combat formation, the tactical retreats, the swordplay, the gunfire and the ar tillery all stir up excitement to a pitch which the drums and trumpets goad into a fever. The afternoon is swathed in smoke and noise during the climactic moments of the castle's recapture by Christian forces, who then execute the van quished monarch (despite his prompt conver sion) and, in a paroxysm of gratuitous cruelty, shoot an unfortunate dove which embodies the (now Christian) soul of the lifeless foe. During this climax—in transports of noise and metal, in the gloating enjoyment of fire and gunpowder, in surging stampedes egged on by the trumpets, in the explosion of fury—ritual violence reaches bewildering levels. But this is only one of the customary facets of such celebrations: ritual allows the freedom for complete and utter excess, adopting forms akin to trance or delirium. The violence of sponta neous impulses, controlled by self-discipline, re spect and law the rest of the year, now bursts forth intoxicatingly for a short while, discharging itself against a symbolic target that can absorb it without causing damage to the community. Looking in from the outside, one is always tak en aback by modes of ritual catharsis in unfa miliar societies. If a given culture can be de fined as the ensemble of mechanisms devised to govern and channel the drives of the group, then what we are witnessing here is a ceremo nial construction that operates—on one level, at least—like a fiery crater discharging high into the air, high enough to make it harmless, all the boiling anger bottled up by each individual since the last occasion for release. Ritual theater enables a whole community to transmute the rage beating within each heart, the murderous instinct within each citizen, into a work of art with the power to flourish year after year. Yet these three tales, with their very diverse plots and settings (the banks of the Jordan at the dawn of the Christian age, the Carolingian empire at the time of its first clashes with the Moslem caliphates of southern Europe, and Spain during the epoch when the last remain ing Arab enclaves were wiped out for good) all tell the same story: they each recount the fun damental battle that enables us to apprehend the universal order and ground our ethical choices—the cosmic battle between supernatu ral forces. In the Colloquy of Saint John the Baptist, inno cence defies lust and injustice, whilst in the other two encounters, the element that causes the clash between the two camps (manned by brave, honorable and worthy soldiers) is their re spective religious faiths. A people bound by one divine law, against a people loyal to a different sacred covenant. The Moslems and Christians who constitute the characters (not, of course, the actors) of these ritual confrontations evis cerate one another in the certainty of defend ing the honor of the name with which God made himself known to their forebears. Traditional societies tend to construct narratives of a symbolic nature, typically offered as repre sentations of a real, historical, or meta-histori cal past. They stage the great challenges of in dividual and collective life (the blind violence of nature and death, the ravages of hatred, the labyrinths of injustice; and also the striving to reconcile human and divine ordinances, duty and desire). Such stories seek to find at the very least an expressive outlet for such con flicts, truly inextricable knots that give rise to tragedy (and lend them a principle of coher ence that may render them, if not altogether intelligible, then at least not altogether unman ageable). Epic language, ritual dance and dra matic action are their most frequent forms of expression. The battles between angels and demons, and the various originary and foundational tales. for instance, make each community explicitly aware of its own code of values, and of its par ticular views regarding the mechanics of the universe. The Zacatecan representations we are concerned with focus on the protagonists of a series of combats (some literary, some historical) that took place several centuries ago, in a continent worlds away from these mountains marking the edge of the great North American deserts. What is this host of Moors doing in a land that has never harbored them, let alone had cause to fight them? This ceremony is a legacy of evangelistic the ater, dramas inspired by the liturgy and the public festivities of New Spain. By staging a conflict devoid of heartfelt bitter ness—since one of the protagonists, the Moor, is such a distant, mysterious figure as to be al most unreal—, the actors can honestly claim that their battles are representations, poetic rather than actual hostilities. Thus the show becomes living theater, only because it has managed to interpose the necessary distance that theater requires, accepting the phantas magorical character of a combat that betokens the symbolic transposition of other conflicts: clashes that remain real, aching and insoluble. The fight against the Moors, understood in all likelihood as a metaphor for the Conquest, helped the first indigenous players to feel that in this universal struggle between divine powers, they, the survivors of catastrophe, could stand victorious under the winning banner; this reaf firmed the strength of the pact that bound them to their new protectors, the angels and the saints, gathering them into the fold of a new family. This production is primarily aimed at a super natural spectator, for it is an intensely affec tionate tribute to him. The dramaturgy re volves around the actors, and mortal spectators such as their relatives, friends and other devotees of the Patron Saint are wel come to watch, with prudent discretion, from the wings as it were, but it is by no means they who are being addressed by the dialogues or the action. The very mechanics of the perform ances, spread out over an arduous amount of time (three whole days, divided into sessions of several hours' duration) makes this fiesta unsuit able as a tourist attraction for people who crave the exotic and the picturesque, or travellers driven by idle curiosity; but it is truly marvelous for anyone who wishes, with all due devotion and respect for the emotion of others, to wit ness a loving dialogue between the inhabitants of the earth and those of the sky. The Moorish contingent is made up of noble, spirited and gentlemanly souls. Some of the ac tors on the Christian side, the more thoughtful ones, manifest their unease when they realize that the victory was only won thanks to a betrayal. Here, the actors enlist in one army or the other (the Christians are formed into batallions of sap pers also called barbones, and the Moslems are ♦\ 92 /♦ V</page><page sequence="13">dressed as Zouaves) for circumstantial reasons, such as family tradition or friendship with other players. They can change bands whenever they like for similar reasons: an engagement, a wed ding, some minor spat with a companion. All know that they are giving John the Baptist just as much pleasure, whichever side they play on. It is obvious that from place to place, not to mention from continent to continent, a celebra tion that appears morphologically similar may en close completely divergent meanings. The Zaca tecas version is clearly popular in its make-up, carried forward by a supernatural impulse, and profoundly devout; this distinguishes it from other examples in which the festivities include the elites to forge a link between social classes, or from those in which the spiritual essence of the undertaking has gradually become eroded and replaced by a purely social function, con verting these into straight, if traditional, fiestas with no aspiration to hierophantic efficacy. These sympathetic Moors, as literary as those that glide through the dreams of Orientalism, have maintained a shining presence among the peoples of Spanish America. By taking over the phantasms of the conquerors, the conquered took possession of a memory that attaches them, no less than language or blood may do, to Hispanic culture and its wealth of legacies. Epilogue One of the climactic moments of the fiesta is the parade in which Moorish and Christian broth ers march shoulder to shoulder through the town center of Zacatecas on Sunday morning, prior to the final combat. Last year, just at the moment when both armies were entering the city together, at a disciplined pace marked by rugged pride and deep devotion, forming a mul ticolored host of youths and elders, women and children, infants in arms and grown men, anoth er ceremony was drawing to a close in the main square, by the cathedral. Here, in this largely Catholic city, a rabbi and a pious Moslem had joined the bishop for Eucharistic service, and to pray for peace between peoples. A Trans lated by Loma Scott Fox. ALTERNATIVE VERTEX mooRs Ann christjaiis LABYRIFITHS OF OTHERilESS JOSÉ ANTONIO GONZÁLEZ ALCANTUD The fiestas of Moors and Christians take place in Spain, essentially, in an area that spreads from southern Valencia to the fringes of lower Andalu sia. All their manifestations bear a certain re semblance to one another in that they are a theatrical, entertaining representation of the conflict between Islam and Christianity. The ri tual also possesses a carnivalesque essence and thus avoids becoming a representation of the radical denial of the Other as a consequence of individual or collective enmity. In Andalusia, these fiestas only exist in the east ern sector of the province, in the lands of the ancient Nasrid kingdom of Granada, whose re conquest by the Catholic monarchy in 1492 led the way to a period of forced co-existence be tween the vanquished and the occupying forces. The former had their legal and religious inde pendence guaranteed thanks to generous pacts made with the Catholic rulers. However, the growing social influence of the conquerors during the following decades, combined with the increasing constraints imposed by the Span ish royalty on ethnic and religious minorities, led to many rebellions, which culminated in the war of the Alpujarras and the general expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain in 1570. From then on, the colonists who arrived en masse to resettle the kingdom of Granada were obligated, by an implicit mandate of the conquest, to eradicate any traces of Moslem spirituality. To accomplish this, they brought the patron saints of their places of origin, attempting to imbue their surroundings with a Christian sen sibility. The old Christian tradition was reestab lished in two phases, first legally and then se mantically and religiously. Thus, from a social and iconological point of view, the most despicable crime one can com mit against a community's honor was to insult the local patron saint. This is why Andalusian and Levantine fiestas of Moors and Christians stage the theft of the patron saint as the crucial episode in the transition between the triumph of the Moors on the first day of the fiesta and the final victory of the Christians on the second day. The final retrieval of the saint can be in terpreted as a constituent act for the commu nity, as it leads to the emergence of a local cul tural and historical identity. There have been and continue to be numerous examples of the interrelation between the religious icon and the honor of Andalusian towns. What else but ter ritoriality can serve as the nucleus of collective honor? And how can this honor be kept alive if not by becoming a ritual—one of whose soci ological characteristics is temporal repetition, and one of whose mythic elements is territori al conquest? Moor-philia and Moor-phobia have been part of the fiestas of Moors and Christians from the out set, with sympathies swinging from one ex treme to the other. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the figure of the Moor bore the epic overtone of the chivalrous hero, an en emy and yet an equal. He is depicted in this way in the first collection of Spanish romances, and continues to be portrayed as such in almost all fiestas of Moors and Christians today. How ever, in the second collection of romances, the Moors—by then converted into Moriscos— were ridiculized and degraded, and appeared doing humbling if not downright humiliating tasks. All kinds of parodie elements were then introduced, and Moors were personified as Islamic prophets, spies, tricksters, etc. Their characterization here is a prelude to the hybris festiva—carnival in the strict sense of the term. The events narrated in the fiestas of Moors and Christians are most often decontextualized. Their storylines tend to include such characters as Castilian warrior Guzmán the Good, Charlemagne and other legendary heroes, alien to local or even regional history. In these Spanish festivities, the process by which Moors were converted into exotic crea tures within Iberian culture since the beginning of the conquest is also evident. André Stoll shrewdly points out that this process "thus comes to complement [...] the actual banish ment of the Moriscos from Granada, and also implicitly lays the groundwork for their defini tive expulsion from the social and economic reality of Spain." We may conclude that the fiestas of Moors and Christians in contemporary Spain constitute a kind of cultural bricolage, and though they ap parently symbolize a rejection of the Other, they actually represent the Other's acceptance by means of elements of popular culture such as humor and parody. This authentic, joyous para dox survives to this day because it is driven by mechanisms characteristic of Otherness—swing ing from attraction to repulsion and identity as the opposing poles of the axis of human cul ture. A Translated by Richard Moszka. THE VERTEX RESTORED A GEOJTlETRJCAL ODYSSEY (inTERVJEW WJTH mAFlUEL SERRAnO) MARGARITA DE ORELLANA AND SANDRA LUNA SinCE Artes de México began its new publishing run, we have been following the career of Manuel Serrano with some interest. He is one of the most outstanding restorers in the country and has al ways impressed us with his ability to give new life to the "almost dead" works of art that he receives. He likes to think of himself as a doctor coming to the aid of challenging new patients. We also see him as an adventurer who unhesitatingly immerses himself in bygone lore, seeking clues to rescue a work. Through this dual vocation, Serrano entered an intri cate geometrical labyrinth when he set out to restore three Mudejar roofs, all of which were over 400 years old: a coupled-rafter alfarje (ornate carved or mar quetry trough-shaped roof), a polychrome arteson ado (flat ceiling with niches or interlacing) and a cupola. Serrano, who has been honing his craft for over thirty-five years, outlines the rigorous and prag matic nature of his work below. As he relates the odyssey of this exemplary work of restoration, he opens our eyes on an incredible world. Do YOU nEED TO KFIOW HOW A WORK OF ART WAS COnSTRUCTED in ORDER TO RE STORE IT? As a restorer of cultural assets, I think it's a fun damental obligation to know the techniques with which an object was constructed, whether it be a roof, a painting, a sculpture or a retable. At the same time, it's also crucial to corroborate these techniques. We investigate the object's historical and aesthetic character through other disciplines such as photography, photogrammetry and ♦ 93 ♦ Richard Moszka. MARGARITA DE ORELLANA AND SANDRA LUNA JOSÉ ANTONIO GONZÁLEZ ALCANTUD</page><page sequence="14">chemical analysis. This information allows us to get to know our "patient" and give the most re liable diagnosis possible. Any other way leads to mistakes. We've seen seriously inadequate res toration work caused by precisely this lack of knowledge about how an object was made. How DID TOU BEGJft WORK jn JTlUDEJAR ART? When I first became aware of the subject, around 1978, I'd been working in the field of restoration for barely fifteen years. I'd worked on mural paintings and the odd retable, but Mudejar roofs entered into the realm of real estate, not art. I was asked to restore them with the idea that houses would be built for them. I then received four semitrailers containing a large number of containers filled with pieces of wood. They told me that it was a Mudejar coupled-rafter roof. I only understood that it was a roof. As it was a completely new subject for me, I im mediately began to research into it. From the very first day, I committed myself to trying to understand what this new challenge was all about. The roof was in pretty bad shape. To start with, the thousands of pieces weren't clas sified. There was an old photograph of the roof when it was in place, but that didn't give me the information I needed either. So we began read ing the books of Manuel Toussaint and Francisco de la Maza. We then discovered some Spanish publications and finally a reference to the roof of Tlaxcala cathedral, otherwise known as the church of San Francisco. This gave me an idea of what all that wood in the warehouse could become. Were the three ÍIIudejar roofs, vou WORKED on BUILT AT THE SA/ÏIE T1ITIE? No. The cupola is from about 1450, the poly chrome is late fifteenth century and the alfarje is late fifteenth to early sixteenth century. We didn't work simultaneously on the three roofs either. We took five years to restore the alfarje, three for the polychrome artesonado and two for the cupola. I began with the flat polychrome roof, which measured 9 by 17 meters. First, I restored the polychrome and treated the wood. All the pieces were measured and then the house was built. The beauty of this artesonado lay precise ly in its polychrome work, since its structure wasn't so complex. As they were often used as ceilings for drawing rooms, these flat roofs used to have another roof on top, which would have been a sloped alfarje, thus forming an attic in the space separating them. This was more common in civil architec ture such as palaces than in religious architec ture. The wooden sections were very big and had been fashioned with the aid of framing squares. For example, one three-meter section would be repeated with the same rhythm, po sition and size of wood. Sometimes the end of the roof would be raised in a frieze, as with this artesonado. One or two years later, I was offered the task of assembling the alfarje or coupled-rafter roof. All we knew about it was that it measured 27 me ters long by 11 wide. However, on examining the timbers, I had second thoughts about its dimen sions. The tie-beams were in fact 11 meters long, but the rafters were placed one after the oth er and this made it difficult to establish the ex act measurements. We therefore decided to restore and construct the roof in a factory courtyard. Then, with the exact measure ments, the house would begin to be built. We worked backward, starting not with the foun dation but with the roof. Where did these roofs comE FRom? All three came from the same place—the col lection of the magnate Randolph Hearst. He was the original Citizen Kane, a very eccentric character indeed. He'd imported almost eighty roofs from Spain, Italy, Portugal and North Af rica to the United States, many of which were fitted into San Simeón castle in California. Our three roofs had been dismantled and put in storage for over fifty years in North Carolina. It seems that the biggest of the three, the alfar je, was intended for the castle's great hall. We don't know why it wasn't installed. The archi tect Logan Wagner found out that this alfarje had belonged to a Franciscan church in Alma gro near Toledo, Spain, where it had been giv en up for lost. It had been removed around 1920, supposedly for exposition, and never returned. The intendant in Almagro almost wept when he found out that the roof still existed and was in excellent condition. Spanish experts such as Enrique Nuere were also overcome. It was a surprise to know that we had worked on one of the most important Mudejar roofs in the world. Had we known beforehand, we might not have attempted it. How AJ1D WHEFl DID THESE WORKS REACH the Ufuted States? We reckon they got there somewhere be tween 1920 and 1930. There were grave political problems in Spain at the time and they didn't have the treaties or legislation to prevent ex ports of this nature. I believe Hearst's collection deserves further study because it plays an im portant role in the history of cultural assets re moved from their place of origin. How DID YOU FEEL WHEfl THE TRUCKS WERE UFILOADED? I was both awed and challenged. There are people who like to lead peaceful lives and those who like to live in conflict. I'm one of the lat ter, as are the owner of the roof and the ar chitect of the house. We love a challenge. What I also liked about these assignments is that they brought me closer to the world in which these works were created. I sometimes feel the atmosphere of the workshop and can almost hear the language of the craftsmen, the Mudejar alarife (architect) discussing how to as semble the rafters, making precise cuts and using framing squares to prepare the joints. It's a mov ing experience, a kind of healthy nostalgia. A BIT LIKE GOiriG BACK in T1IT1E? Using modern techniques and tools, we created an atmosphere similar to that in which the roofs were first constructed, namely a workshop com plete with carpenters, cabinetmakers, drafts men and assistants. We weren't just restorers but craftsmen. There we were, 500 years later, apprentices, journeymen and the master alar ife directing the work. I felt like the master alarife as I led my team. The workshop became a school which was al most religious in nature—our tools were sacred. For example, when working on the alfarje, I re moved headed and headless nails up to a length of 40 centimeters, which had been hand-made one by one. I thought it only fitting that I should be part of the team in Monterrey. I lived there, had lunch on the site and was always on hand. I gave everyone access to the pieces and this created respect for what we were doing. It was like doing a bizarre jigsaw puzzle as we used the crane to put these huge timbers in their proper place. The workmen found it hard to grasp that they were working on something from the sixteenth century, but they did realize it was very im portant. I would take photos and give them the enlargements. When I brought books in, they were excited to see similar photos on the pages. How DID THE RECOnSTRUCTIOn PROCESS UF1FOLD? We photographed everything. I considered it very important to document every last detail. The owner, for his part, registered the daily ad vances with a small video camera. The work took place in Monterrey and we hadn't taken the seasonal bad weather into account. It was 45 degrees in the shade that summer, both winters were terrible and the rain was awful. We were always anxious about the state of the roof. The timbers had bowed, having been neglected for so long but, at just over 400 years old, they were still going strong—the sap would still run if the sun shone on them. As we were putting the roof together, we dis covered something very important. The tie beams, timbers measuring 11 meters long, 40 centimeters high and almost 20 centimeters wide, had warped up to 30 centimeters. We didn't know what was going to happen to them. How ever, once the fifty or so racimos (decorative groups) were attached to the central almizate (the horizontal paneling over the collar-beams of an alfarje), the tie-beams began to straight en. This was because the weight of the racimos was taken up by the rafters. These were in turn supported by a brace which was connected to the tie-beams. When I saw how they straight ened, I admired Mudejar architecture and crafts manship even more. Their wisdom had enabled them to master geometry and mathematics. This sloped structure, fixed and perfectly assem bled, formed a coupled-rafter roof. The wind pressure on one rafter or another created a series of balances and counterbalances, binding the structure together perfectly. When we saw all this we decided that it should cover the house as a functional roof, rather than leaving it as a decorative ceiling protected by an exte ♦ 94 ♦</page><page sequence="15">rior cover, thus cancelling out its function. It was very interesting to study the decoration and tracery, to make framing squares, to classify the different pieces, its mocdrabes (a convex-con cave ornament), and to form a decorative group, because many had been taken apart. Many of the mocárabes weren't even in one piece. Some highly respected architects were of the opinion that the roof should be split in two and used in different sites. Fortunately, however, those involved believed that the roof was a whole and should be left as such. Furthermore, it was almost complete. It was just missing a pair of rafters and a racimo, which was nothing let's say 0.1 percent of the wood. Where atid how was the coupled-rafter ALFARJE ASSEJTIBLED FOR THE FJRST TJm£? When we had all the wood sections classified, restored and treated, we assembled them in a factory, raised on sand-filled metal barrels at a height of 1 m 30 cm. We attached the tie-beams, then the braces and worked up to complete the rest of the roof. It was under observation for three years, whilst the house was being built. Once the walls of the house were finished, we started to take the alfarje apart, transport it and set it in place. At that time, there wasn't an easy route up that part of the Sierra Madre in Mon terrey. We did a dry run with bamboo sticks and pieces of wood to see if we could make the turns with the tie-beams. We had to use a crane to get the timbers there. However, to move the crane up and had to help it up with another smaller crane. The architect had built some wall plates into the top of the walls to receive my roof. Some special carts were also built to move the tim bers, since the crane's arms couldn't move the wood from one side to the other. So we lifted some carts up and pulled them manually to the other side to put all the tie-beams in place. It was very difficult to do it any other way in the Sierra. With the exception of some electrical equipment and the crane, we worked like craftsmen from the sixteenth century. We used pulleys to hoist the pieces up 11 meters, which is a height of al most three stories. The nave in a church would have been this high. The tie-beams, tracery and the rest of the roof were made in workshops. Sometimes, a workshop was set up inside the church. Are THERE mAFlY DIFFEREflCES BETWEEFl THIS SPATUSH ROOF AFID THE ALFARJE in THE FRATlCISCAn CO/lVEnT OF TLAXCALA? Yes. Firstly in the wood, although both are made of pine. These roofs were made in Mexico by Spanish master builders with the help of in digenous craftsmen, for whom the roofing of a house was something entirely different. The workmanship in Tlaxcala is slightly rougher. The wooden sections had to be very precise. They couldn't afford to make some timbers thinner and others thicker because that would alter the dimensions and distort the roof. That's why they used set squares, which were sections of wood with very exact angles, made for the roof which was to be built. Between fifteen and forty framing squares were made, depending on the complexity of the roof. The craftsmen cut the wood with hatchets and then measured each section with the set square. The master builder checked each timber and if some were not cut correctly, they weren't used for their original purpose. They were cut and used in another part. I've seen this happen - many timbers have the mark of having been worked for another part of the roof. However much the craftsmen thought they had deviated from the plan, in fact they hadn't. The difference is in the work that can't be seen, on top of the roof. There we see the mark of the tools, the way of working, the joints, how well made they were. The quality of workmanship aside, there is no doubt that the alfarjes in Mexico were built from the pages of Diego López de Arenas' Manual de carpintería de lo blanco (Manual of Detailed Carpentry), which was writ ten around about 1600. The author himself says that he wrote the book because he saw that craftsmen, and even master builders, had neg lected the craft of carpentry. There were cases in which roofs collapsed, because they had been badly put together. He felt that it was necessary to write a manual and leave testimo ny to how it should be done. The first thing that an alarife needed to know to know was the width of the nave that he was going to roof. The estimate would be based on this measurement. He would ask a series of ques tions; "Do you want it simple, with tracery or with gold stars? Do you want it with eight-point ed, ten-pointed or twelve-pointed stars? How do you want it?" Of course, these options implied a greater or lesser cost. Based on the width, the alarife would apply a rule, a formula, to divide the space into cuerda and calle (cord and lane), with cuerdas being the wood rafters and calles the spaces between them. Once the space was divided up into so many cuerdas and calles, the structure was planned according to its component elements, such as roof tiles, zinc sheets or earth. The options available could be sloped roofs with their collar-beams in the center, with racimos or tracery; with one beam or the whole almi zate in tracery; or sections with and some with out, as in Tlaxcala. The alarife made the design for the tracery and based on this completed the entire structure. Speaking of structure, our alfarje was missing its apse vault, which goes above the altar, and is usually hexagonal. The roof is straight as far as the apse. This roof didn't have an apse vault, so we thought it had been lost. However, when the owner visited Almagro and took photo graphs of the original site, which Is now a fur niture factory with a sheet-metal roof, he saw that there had never been an apse, as the building ended in a flat wall. The architect Jorge Loyzaga decided that our roof should have one anyway, so we added it in. However, we left the wood undecorated to make the al teration obvious. What was jt like to work on the cupola/ This piece had also belonged to Hearst's collec tion. Hearst had given it to his doctor who ap parently never used it. Years later, the owner of the other two roofs acquired it at an auction in London. It was given to me unassembled, al though it had been very roughly set up for the auction. This domical vault was made up of eight seg ments which formed the walls and the octago nal almizate (the flat upper part). It had an in terlocking system which was similar to that of the alfarjes: the almizate was joined to the horizon tal panels by means of joints. This cupola didn't have a brace, which is what gives solidity to a roof. The groove and tongue (both are cuts in the rafters which allow the tie-beam to be joined to the brace) were very damaged. These were very fragile pieces which were ex posed to a lot of movement. Furthermore, the roof had been repaired an infinite number of times during its lifetime with screws, nails and wood of all sorts. The first step was to eliminate all of these alter ations in order to find the original structure and restore it from there. We worked cautiously in the workshop for a year and a half. Next, we moved to a house where it now covers the guestroom at a height of six meters. This roof has a richly adorned tracery design. Observing first-hand the rhythm of its geome try, its carving, was truly exceptional. Diego López de Arenas considered that the master alar ife who carved the cupola had obtained his doc torate in detailed carpentry. Owing to its rela tively small dimensions, the design and richness were most important features of this roof. It was a filigree of wood. Previous alterations had covered the extremely subtle lines that accentuated the geometry of the tracery. There were small black two-millimeter wide lines contrasting with the tones of the cedar wood. Equally subtle mocárabes and niches were also red. The impression created by this cupola was that of standing beneath a celestial vault. I could contemplate the fine geometry of the constellations in this star-filled sky. I think I'm one of the privileged few, in either Spain or in North America, who've had the opportunity to work on a cupola with such fine tracery and polychrome. It was an extremely humbling experience to work on these pieces, to observe their form, their geometry, their cuts and joints. Those long-dead craftsmen devoted themselves to these works with no other reason or purpose than to do their job well. I sometime scratch myself answering so many calls and e-mails that I realize we've lost the ability to truly devote ourselves to a job. After 500 years, works such as these still have the power to move us through the quality with which they were made and the care with which they were ♦ 95 ♦</page><page sequence="16">achieved. Restoring them was, without doubt, a powerful lesson. A Translated by David Bevis. \ N. ' Rx O M A N T I C VERTEX THE mOORJSH PAVJLJOn: EVOCATJOn OF Uni VERS ALITY ELISA GARCÍA BARRAGÁN EcLECTicism flooded fTlEXicÀn architec ture In the last third of the nineteenth cen tury, legitimizing the different trends in vogue at the time. In breaking with orthodox ties to a certain style, an architect's creativity drift ed along paths more akin to his spirit. This autonomy, however, was not a new idea. Victor Hugo—who was much admired in Mexico—used to praise "freedom in art," and the ideology of Victor Cousin, leader of the eclectic spiritualist philosophy, was very much alive. Moreover, architects returning to Mexico after completing their studies In France or traveling through Europe, spread word of the innovations in construction. Leading up to this liberalization were the re forms made to the student syllabus in the Academy of San Carlos by Sicilian Javier Cavallari, the chair of architecture since 1857. The inclusion of history of architecture as a subject made students consider all cultures and their best contributions as both enjoy able and worthy of analysis. If at first the Ro mantic trend made them prefer the Middle Ages, later they inclined more toward the Oriental style, sowing the city with buildings whose eclectic characteristics were well-re ceived. Undoubtedly the concepts proposed in 1882 by Juan de Dios de la Rada Delgado in his speech oh joining the San Fernando Aca demy^ in Madrid, also carried considerable \ / weight. Posing the question, "what is, and what should be the proper style for nine teenth-century architecture?" his, response was: "It has to be eclectic." Despite the pseu do-French style that reigned in Mexico at that time, an alert from the lips of a distinguished professor in Madrid could not go unheard. Neither was it wise to disregard the time honored influence which the Spanish acade mies had always wielded. So this explains why in 1884 José Ramón Ibarrola designed a neo-Moorish pavilion to represent Mexico in the World's Fair of New Orleans. A certain hlstoricist nature was present in this Orientalism because, as Israel Katzman says: "any mention of classic, neo Gothic or neo-Mudejar in the nineteenth cen tury does not refer to a full return to those styles, but to a certain decorative treatment and to the proportions and positioning of cer tain elements, if only on facades." In fact, one cannot speak of a truly faithful return to a style in an archaeological sense; it is simply a question of degrees of kinship. Ibarrola, one of the first students to benefit from Cavallari's Innovations, graduated with honors in architecture and engineering in 1862. His activities diversified into railroad and hy draulic works, particularly in the state of Puebla, where he met Eduardo Tamariz y Al mendaro who had studied in the Arts and Trades School in Paris, and had traveled through the Orient and North Africa. Upon his return. Tamariz took up residence in the city of Puebla, where he manifested his ap preciation of the shapes and interiors of Is lamic buildings by introducing them into the decoration of buildings like the House of thex Immaculate Conception—an eclectic struc ture with a beautiful Moorish patio whose walls aré covered with arabesque tiling much like the Aihambra. Key factor in Ibarrola's neo-Mudejar design were, on the one hand, his friendship with Tamariz and, on the oth er, his knowledge ofbther pavilions of orien tal influence, such as the one Spain present ed at the World's Fair in Vienna in 1873; or the Moorish Horticultural Pavilion at the Philadelphia Fair of 1876. According to Mauricio Tenorio Trillo, Ibarrola drew his inspiration /fnore from the popular latter pavilion than from the Spanish-Moorish legacy left in Mexico. It was thought that Mexico's presentation would have a far-reaching effect, not only in a much-desired improvement in the econo my, but that the country would appear be fore the eyes of the world as a thoroughly modern Mexico. Transcending nationalistic fa brications, the pavilion would need to make a universal impact Ibarrola, responsible both for the architecture and engineering, pro posed an attractive design of Moorish inspira tion which visitors to the exhibition dubbed "The Mexican Aihambra." This structure al so demonstrated such novelties as the use of cast iron, reliefs and multicolored decoration in accordance with the selected paradigm. Tenorio Trillo describes it in greater detail: "It housed exhibits of Mexican minerals, in cluding half a ton of silver piled into a mound [...]. Built by the firm Keystone Bridge of Pittsburgh, it could be disassembled [...]; in fact, according to commentators on the fair, Mexico and Japan mounted the most im pressive stands 6f all foreign exhibitors in the New Orleans Expo." During'the exposition's lengthy duration— 1884-1886—this unique, glittering, colorful and translucent structure of the utmost modernity earned the unanimous admiration of all who saw it On November 8, 1884, the prestigious Spanish magazine La Ilustración Española y Americana referred to it in the fol lowing terms: "it Is an artistic, octagonal, Arab-style pavilion, whose sides faithfully re produce the most beautiful arches of the Aihambra and of the Alcázar in Seville." Later, on May 11, 1885, the Mexican newspa per La Patria Ilustrada published a splendid engraving showing the building's rich orien tal detail: a crown of merlons on top, multi foliate wrought-iron arches and other orna ments, tracery and bas-reliefs with geometric patterns reminiscent of mosaics. The ara besque filigree tracery of the stained glass in the wall openings around it evoke Oriental latticework, while the slender columns in the entrance lobby bring to mind the Patio de los Leones and the Patio de los Abencerra jes patios of the Aihambra—evoked in Iba rrola's curious design of the capitals. A beautiful stained-glass cupola with stilted dome, crowned by the Mexican eagle. Is the main source of lighting. The Mexican coat of arms and an undulating flag are further in dicators of the nationality of the pavilion. The material used to build the modern edi fice showed not only the utilitarian applica tions of wrought iron, but its decorative pos sibilities. The octagonal pavilion was an effective way to show the world Mexico's progress and creativity. As this Moorish pavil ion could be easily disassembled, some twenti eth-century publications even spread the un founded rumor that the building had toured numerous fairs. In feet It was taken to Alameda Park in Mex ico City to become a headquarters for the National Lottery for Public Assistance, where residents would go to witness draws. A pho tograph taken around 1903 shows it as such. In 1908 a monument to Benito Juárez, displaced the pavilion which was relegated to Santa Maria la Ribera Park. There, it remains nine ty years later, a rendezvous point and a bandstand offering outdoor afternoon per formances in the newly developed district. During transportation the pavilion suffered a few changes: the stained-glass windows disappeared, exposing a view of the beauti ful set of columns inside and the sheet-metal roof decorated with tracery and colorful geometric motifs. Despite years of deterio ration, it was not until 1986 that the National Institute of Anthropology and History or dered the restoration of Ibarrola's pavilion and declared it a Historic Monument. At its site in Santa María la Ribera, the pavil ion is a reminder of the course taken by Mexican architecture at the end of the nine teenth century. Because of its aesthetic value and techniques, this building resisted tran sience and was more than a passing fad. Echoing colonial touches, but above all the romantic refinement of Islamic tradition, this monument does not hide Its zeal for cos mopolitanism. In a dignified tribute to the Ai hambra, one of the world's outstanding edi fices and a cultural heritage site, José Ramón Ibarrola draped his pavilion in a romantic veil of universality.
