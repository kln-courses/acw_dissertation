<plain_text><page sequence="1">"If Your Depict a Bird, Give it Space to Fly": Eastern Psychologies, the Arts, and Self-Knowledge Eleanor Rosch Evolutionary psychological theory is seeking to colonize the arts. Art is to be seen as useful-specifically useful to human beings as they are conceived within the present standard cognitive science framework. This paper is intended as a dissenting voice. In it I will seek to show how the imaginative arts may be universal and treasured precisely because they can offer humans a glimpse of a different mode of knowing (and being), a different kind of psychology altogether, than does our standard psychological theory or cognitive science. The implication is that the cognitive sciences could learn more by asking-rather than telling-the arts about what kind of creatures humans actually are. Let us look at the arguments in the majority of papers in this volume. We are shown how an evolutionary perspective on imaginative art forms may inform us about the origins and usefulness of: play, simulation, cooperation, bonding, empathy, competition, planning, narrative, fantasy, imagination, metaphor, morality, symbols, neurology, cognition, representation, meta-representation and all the other tools presently deemed necessary for human development, survival, and reproduction. While all this may be quite true and flows naturally from evolutionary theory, it is not necessarily the whole story. It does not tell us about the art of art forms. When we are deeply struck (for example, when the terrible climax of a tragedy is known and felt as incomprehensibly, timelessly perfect), we seem to have a glimpse of something else-something other than a survival mode of being. In fact, of something other than the way our minds usually function, or the way we think they function. The problem is this: our present cognitive sciences (and, to some extent, what psychologists call "folk psychology") give a particular analytic picture of the human mind and body. But that picture is roundly contradicted by another coexisting set of human intimations and intuitions. These alternative intuitions are most fully developed in the meditative and contemplative traditions of the world. Such traditions have evolved systems for talking 236 SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="2">Space to Fly 237 about those intuitions and methods for teaching people how to know and live them. Within our scientific traditions, we have developed methods for constructing theories and performing experiments that are dependent on the analytic worldview. Between the two is a no man's land. In it live and flourish the arts. I will argue that the special province of the arts is to show people themselves in a mirror that reflects their ordinary self image in the light of that deeper and broader understanding. Here are some of the contrasts. In most cognitive science, human cognition is seen as basically isolated from the world. Laboriously, the human builds up indirect internal cognitive representations of the causal contingencies in the world such that he (or his community or gene pool) may survive and reproduce in an evolutionarily successful manner. Such survival and reproduction is the only originating value in this account. Yet humans also have a sense that they know the world in a more direct and real way than this, that they are already parts of interdependent wholes, and that their most treasured intimations of goodness do not depend whatsoever on outcomes. There are a few new trends in cognitive science, to be detailed in the course of the paper, which actually reflect and support this alternative point of view. But it is the arts that have functioned traditionally for people as a release precisely from the everyday constricted mode of feeling, thinking, and acting represented in the prevailing cognitive science format. Thus exploring this function of the arts can in turn reflect back upon and serve as guide for the cognitive sciences. How? The arts are both created and appreciated by the activity of the senses and of the thinking mind. According to some meditation traditions (particularly later Buddhism) activity of the senses and of thoughts are inherently double-faced: they arise from and can point back either to their surface confused habitual mode of operation, which is what humans are conscious of most of the time, or to a deeper, more panoramic, and more immediate wisdom way of knowing, feeling, and being. Such an underlying nascent wisdom mode is said to be always available, half glimpsed, by everyone (Rosch, in preparation; Trungpa, 1976; Sogyal, 1993). It is this double-faced conundrum that forms the arena in which the arts are at play. In this paper, I will explore several aspects of psychology as highlighted by the arts: 1) Humans as a directly felt part of the natural world. 2) Humans as beings that are part of humanity. 3) Humans as part of what is said to be inexpressible but of supreme importance. The three aspects are highly interrelated. SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="3">238 Eleanor Rosch A warning about style: the paper is intended to be evocative--like its subject matter. For example, the term "intuition" is used, not in a technical sense, but as a means of pointing the reader to his/her own experiences of these matters. Claims are broadly sketched to invite contemplation of their import. This does not mean, however, that the paper is either hermeneutical, political, or "post-modern." Granted that there is great variation in what the creators and consumers of the arts in different times and cultures have thought and said about what they were doing, and granted there are many subgroups within each Eastern tradition that offer different doctrines and practices, those matters are the legitimate subject of a different sort of analysis from what is being carried out here. The present claim is that humans have a mode of knowing themselves and their world that is more basic and deeply rooted than the habits of mind that we usually deploy, and that art, at its best, can provide glimpses and connections to that realm of psychology. The reader interested in exploring such a perspective might want to bring to mind those works in the arts that have most deeply struck or affected him/ her in the past, and think about the categories that follow in relation to experience of those personally potent works. I. Humans as a Part of Nature Both standard cognitive science and a certain sort of common sense tell us that humans and other organisms are separate from their environments. At a more micro level, the perceiving mind is considered obviously separate from the objects it perceives. In fact, we ordinarily think of our consciousness as something confined behind the eyes, peering out at a separated world. This is precisely not the way the world is nor the way perception actually works from the points of view of most of the meditation traditions and some trends in cognitive science (see Gibson, 1979; Jarvilehto, 1998a, b, 1999; Neisser, 1993; Rosch, 1996,1999; Skarda, 1999; Varela, Thompson and Rosch, 1991). It is also not the perceived world of which we sometimes catch cherished glimpses in daily life or that can be pointedly conjured up by a variety of artistic styles. J. J. Gibson, the founder of ecological psychology, puts the matter thus: To perceive the world is to coperceive oneself ... The optical information to specify the self... accompanies the optical information to specify the environment... The one could not exist without the other... The supposedly separate realms of the subjective and the objective are actually only poles of attention. The dualism of observer and environment is unnecessary. The information for the perception of "here" is of the same kind as the information for the perception of "there," and a continuous layout of surfaces extends from the one to the other. (116) SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="4">Space to Fly 239 Gibson's view may be most immediately understandable in perceiving one's location. One knows where one is only in relation to where other things are and vice versa; that is, one's judgment about one's own location and one's judgment about the location of relevant environmental reference points are aspects of the same inclusive informational field. Perception is direct for Gibson in that it is the percept, with all of its immediate information about both subject and object, which is primary, and which Gibson takes as the basis for his science. Another cognitive scientist struggling to express a wholistic view of perception in biological terms is Iran-Nejad, the founder of biofunctionalism. In biofunctionalism, the ground of perception and cognition is the ongoing activity of brain subsystems that work in concert in a global and integrative fashion. The role of that ground in perception is described thus: The internal ground is not a patchwork map of the external scene. Rather, it is holistic, global, and goes far beyond what is being directly observed. For instance, even though the person is facing the landscape, the internal ground is likely to extend continuously to what lies behind, underneath, and above the individual. Neither does the internal ground stop at the distant horizon that surrounds the person. (Iran-Nejad, Marsh, and Clements, 484) This is actually an apt description of the reported experience of meditators engaging in practices designed to relax, at least somewhat, their perceptually self-centered visual fixation (Rosch, 1997; Wangyal, 1993). The matter is stated somewhat abstractly in ecological psychology and biofunctionalism because it is presented as a scientific principle. It is anything but abstract as discovered by meditators, artists, and regular people. Let's start with the regular people; do any of the following experiences seem familiar? You are driving along a winding mountain highway and stop at a "vista point." As you look out, you feel engulfed by a panoramic sense of mountains, valleys, sky, and space, and, perhaps, the awareness of your own body and senses as a small point within these vast surroundings. The same thing might happen in a city with tall buildings. Or it might happen among people, as in playing a team sport in which, for a moment, the movements of all the other players seem known as a whole without attention or effort. (Martial artists and star basketball players frequently report experiences like this.) But special props in the environment are not needed to know the world in this manner. Think of a time when you were working intensely toward a goal or deadline (papers, exams, Christmas shopping, whatever), and then it is finished; you have done your best; you walk out- and behold!-there is a world all around you: perhaps green grass or snow, SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="5">240 Eleanor Rosch trees, people walking, dogs chasing each other, a leaf floating down through the air. That world (more accurately, that mode of knowing the world) was there all along, but now one has relaxed the mind and body enough to perceive it. Among the meditation traditions, it is Taoism that has most explored and emphasized the human relatedness to the natural world (Belyea and Tainer, 1991; Kohn, 1993). However, in most forms of Buddhism (and some Hinduism), such experiences would also be considered glimpses of a more basic way of knowing than the fragmented, constricted, self-enclosed sense of what it is to know that we generally take for granted. Although Buddhism tends to talk about beginning meditation as an analysis of experience into its components and Taoism talks about integration of different functions, the actual practices taught by both are often highly integrative. Meditation at its best serves not just to calm or focus the mind but to actually begin to integrate the person, to bring body and mind together, to bring the senses and their objects (the seen, heard, touched, tasted, smelled, and thought) together with the sense of body and mind, to bring the sense of movement and action together with body, mind, senses and all the rest. As the practitioner tunes into that more basic and more integrated sense of being and knowing, a realization quite revolutionary to our psychology may begin to dawn: perceiving and knowing are not something confined to a personified consciousness confined behind the eyes peering out at a separated world, but are something happening from all of it together: environment, mind, and organism. The supposed knower (or knowing self) is just a part or aspect of the presentation of this knowing field. This is the beginning of what is described in some forms of later Buddhism as panoramic awareness. Many of the arts serve to convey something of such a sense of knowing. Chinese landscape painting from its inception (Xin, Barnhart, Chongzheng, Cahill, Shaojun, and Hung, 1997) has specialized in visions of great mountains, rivers, valleys, and vistas among which are blended tiny human houses and figures. Gazing at such landscapes can evoke states similar to or even more "subtle" and pleasurable than those engendered by actual vistas (as reported by subjects in a recent study; Rosch, in preparation). Narratives too, although typically verbal, have settings that the listener or reader can imagine and that are fundamental to the narrative. Because in both verbal and pictorial presentations, the setting, the figures, and the action are all presented in the same imaginative modality (such as brush strokes or the author's words), the audience can more readily apprehend and participate SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="6">Space to Fly 241 in the mutual determination of figure and setting than in real life where our ordinary assumptions and habits hold sway. The intuition of oneself and other humans as a direct part of nature applies also to the energy level of experience. To know oneself as the movement of chi is perhaps most obviously and directly the province of music and dance. But it is also conveyed pictorially. This may be by means of content: think of mountain landscapes with rushing streams and waterfalls or of winds tearing at trees and human clothing. More likely it is conveyed by design and the quality of brush strokes. Van Gogh's vision is of a world so infused with chi that it fairly leaps off the canvas in great smears of paint, a world in which even the most bucolic of scenes seems invested with moving energy. Likewise, in narrative it is the quality and style of description that paints things in their energy aspect. Hemingway was a master of this: In the late summer of that year, we'd lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plains to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving, and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterwards the road bare and white except for the leaves. (A Farewell to Arms, 1) Perhaps it is because humans already have the ability to directly know themselves as an interdependently arising part of the energies of nature that they would think to elaborate this into systems such as Darwinism and evolutionary psychology. However, when this is expressed in an art, such as Chinese landscape painting or Van Gogh or the writing style of Hemingway, it appears to have the power to awaken a form of knowing of a different quality with different implications than does its scientific expression. The scientific version often seems to lead the intellect to the conclusion that we are mere products of nature and as such without value or meaning; that is, it tends to cut off the rest of the knowing that goes with this intuition. (The Christianity-versus-evolution debate, which might seem to address related issues, has tended to be framed in terms of doctrine, not the psychology of knowing.) When the underlying human knowledge of onself as part of nature is evoked, it is not a nihilistic but a positive understanding with links to a sense of inherent connectedness and value--as is expressed in Mary Oliver's "Wild Geese": SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="7">242 Eleanor Rosch You do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves. Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile the world goes on. Meanwhile the sun and clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes, the prairies and the deep trees the mountains and the rivers. Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air, are heading home again. Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting- over and over announcing your place in the family of things. (110) II. Humans as a Part of Humanity People are fascinated by images of other humans. Anthropologists recount the intense interest and rapt attention with which people unfamiliar with photography greet their first viewing of photographs of themselves and other people (Heider, 1997). In the modern world, photojournalism has had enormous impact on international events as photographs of suffering people sway public opinion. People are known to not infrequently snatch up precious family photographs to take with them as they flee burning buildings in lieu of retrieving more practical objects. And advertisers know they can sell all manner of products through pictures of people. I once had a disaffected graduate student who claimed that it was a picture on the cover of a textbook (Neisser, 1982), an Imogen Cunningham photograph of an old man remembering, that decided him to remain in graduate school researching human memory. We are also fascinated by story-telling, another activity which no culture lacks. It is humans and other anthropomorphized beings that serve as the protagonists of stories. As soon as children begin to talk, they start to tell proto-narratives about themselves and others, which, molded by care-givers into culturally appropriate forms, become the basis of much human SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="8">Space to Fly 243 communication (Miller, 1994; Snow, 1990). No culture has ever been found that lacks gossip. And who among us who tries to teach an abstract subject has not discovered that if we touch on a bit of human life story, students become suddenly hushed and stare at us with unreasonable concentration? That humans should be intensely interested in members of their own species seems natural and is certainly compatible with an evolutionary point of view. After all, even pigeons can perform prodigious feats of memory for pictures of pigeons (Herrnstein, 1976) and there is evidence for a special area in the human brain for face recognition (Kanwisher, McDermott, and Chun, 1997). Many of the papers in this volume are eloquent in recounting the usefulness of imaginative narrative in various evoluntionary tasks. I do not wish to deny any of this. The perspective provided by Eastern psychologies and by the cognitive science referenced in the following sections serves not to refute but to add to and contextualize this picture within a larger understanding of what it is to be human. The contributions of these traditions fall into several categories: A. The Intersubjective Self As mothers coo, make faces, and play with their infants, mother and infant fall into motions and vocalizations that respond to and lead each other simultaneously. If, through experimental manipulation of video feedback, the timing of either party is displaced, the interaction breaks down to the great distress of the infant and irritation of the mother. Trevarthen (1993) called this intersubjectivity and suggested it as the birth of the intersubjective self. Ellen Dissanayake's paper in this volume elaborates this work and its implications. Many social science traditions-from object relations theory in psychoanalysis to social constructionism in sociology--also point to the intersubjective origins and nature of the self. How could such theories have been originally conceived or be comprehensible to others without a background of certain categories of shared experience? Think of experiences of interdependent relatedness you may have had: improvising music with a group, participating in a demonstration, dancing with a partner, a moment of feeling unity with a loved one, or simply chatting with friends. What the precision of Buddhist mindfulness meditation (Goldstein and Kornfield, 1987; Nhat Hanh, 1976; Rosch, 1997) contributes to this background is the awareness that, just as perception of the location of one's body is a pole of attention in relation to perception of the environment, so the sense of oneself in interaction with another is only one aspect of the total experience of that interactive event. SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="9">244 Eleanor Rosch Perhaps this is the way in which it is possible for people to identify with and be so affected by visual and narrative representations of other humans; that is, the perception of the other is inherently, moment by moment, also defining of the self. B. Compassionate Identification: The Intersubjective Self is Any Person Who has not had the experience indicated by the phrase in common parlance, "There but for the grace of God go I"? And who has not felt at some point amazed at being confined to just one small life which somehow happens to be one's own? (As the protagonist of Ethan Canin's story "Accountant" puts it in the final denouement of that remarkable character portrait: "I suppose I was wondering, although it is strange for me to admit it, why, of all the lives that might have been mine, I have led the one I have just described" (56). The fact is that humans have a mode of knowing in terms of interrelated wholes in which they sense themselves as potentially (according to some traditions, actually) occupying any place or role in the conceivable world. In Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, such experiences are characterized as inseparable from warmth towards or compassion for others. This is portrayed in (selected) stanzas from the poem "Please Call Me by My True Names" by Vietnamese Buddhist monk and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh: Look deeply: I arrive in every second...... I am the frog swimming happily in the clear water of a pond, and I am also the grass-snake who, approaching in silence, feeds itself on the frog. I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones, my legs as thin as bamboo sticks, and I am the arms merchant, selling deadly weapons to Uganda. I am the 12-year-old girl, refugee on a small boat, who throws herself into the ocean after being raped by a sea pirate, and I am the pirate, my heart not yet capable of seeing and loving..... SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="10">Space to Fly 245 Please call me by my true names, so I can hear all my cries and my laughs at once, so I can see that my joy and pain are one. Please call me by my true names, so I can wake up, and so the door of my heart can be left open, the door of compassion. (1987, 63-64) In daily life, such compassionate identification with others may be blocked by the self-involved habits of mind with which people normally relate to what they consider the real world. Narrative art forms, both visual and verbal, by the very fact of being perceived as representational rather than real (elaborated further in Section II-D), may free people momentarily to experience themselves in an alternative mode, the mode of natural identification with the possibilities of existence in a larger world that contains everyone. C. Human Complexity Chesterton spoke of "the clean, well-lit prison of one idea." The conceptual mind wants to define, predict, and tie everything down in determinate packages-as is reflected in most of the causal models of psychology and cognitive science. Yet humans are also aware of the complexity of the interdependence of the phenomenal world; this is reflected in some scientific approaches, such as dynamical systems theory (Thelen and Smith, 1994). Beyond that, scientist, poet, and self-help guru alike are wont to sometimes admit a sense of the unlimitability, even unfathomability, of a human. After all, it is the ungraspableness of the Mona Lisa's smile that is credited with making this painting one of the best-known in the Western world. The narrative arts are not limited to showing human action as the product either of simple internal or external causes as the cognitive sciences struggle to do (see papers in the American Psychologist, July 1999), but can paint settings, histories, intentions and all the rest into a single fabric in which the reader or viewer can participate in the actions of characters as coming from an extended sense of the person. D. Experience without Personal Hope and Fear Why is it that humans take such delight in identification with representational characters in fictional worlds? Evolutionary psychology offers some practical reasons. The earliest Buddhist psychology of the SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="11">246 Eleanor Rosch Abhidharma (Guenther and Kawamura, 1975; Narada, 1975; Trungpa, 1981; Varela, Thompson, and Rosch, 1991) offers an additional possibility. In these texts it is argued that the sense of a solid and enduring ego self from whose vantage point we usually experience life (and which is credited with causing all our troubles) is actually built up out of five skandas (heaps) consisting of a dualistic sense of body, feeling, perception, habits, and consciousness. Perception (the third of these heaps), from the point of view of the ego mind, always filters experience through personal hopes and fears. But it is further taught, and particularly emphasized in later Buddhism, that that is not necessary, that there is an underlying mode of immediate perception that is without the bias of hope and fear concerning one's (putative) self. Note that this is not a state of indifference (one of the egoistic states of feeling, according to the Abhidharma system) but rather an appreciative mode of knowing one's experience, whether it be positive or negative experience, as it immediately occurs in its full vividness. The appreciator of the arts and of fictional narrative always knows, at some level, that (s)he is not the character in the art work. Thus (s)he can fully identify with and participate in the vividness of that character's life and world without the pervasive filter of self interest. By that sleight-of-hand, the reader or viewer may perhaps be caught off guard in glimpsing the potential of a more direct mode of knowing. E. The Inherent Value of Humanness The arts have the capacity to show what is most trivial and most terrible in human life as worthy of our regard, and, through this, people may experience their own lives as worthy. One aspect of this is addressed by Confucianism. Interestingly, despite its enormous influence for centuries in Asia, Confucianism has thus far been generally neglected in the flow of Asian teaching to the West. This is unfortunate on several counts. It may be leading western cross-cultural psychologists to mistake Confucian ideals for psychological collectivism (Markus, Kitayama and Heiman, 1996), and it prevents westerners from exploring the unique contributions which the Confucian system might have to offer. Confucianism points to the human intuition that Humanness itself has inherent value and that the cultivation of Humanness is a worthy life endeavor (Yao, 2000). The West's own humanism, which makes something of the same claim, might well want to look at the multi-leveled elaboration of a path for the cultivation of the human potential laid out in Confucianism. It is such a sense of the value of Humanness that the arts can so dynamically convey. This is not the end of the story. We have so far sketched a few implications for the arts of the claim that people know themselves as part of the natural SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="12">Space to Fly 247 and social world. But portraits of the human as part of nature and part of humanity do not stand alone. Each claim that has been made thus far has a quality of incompleteness. Each claim opens towards further intuitions, less easily characterized. III. Humans as a Part of Inexpressible, Unthinkable Openness and "Sacredness" What can be said about this? It is the gist of it all. (It may sound somber but humor is as good as haiku for flashing openness.) One might expect that this domain would be the special province of religion, but in fact the world's religions have been mostly otherwise engaged-for good sociological and psychological reasons. All the meditation traditions have had a great deal to say about this, perhaps too much. Our cognitive sciences have had nothing at all to say about it, which may be too little. The problem is that, by its very nature, whenever you turn to face into or to actively pursue this ground of the mind, what you see is something else. But the arts can do a great job of getting through to us because they can slip it to us sideways so to speak. This may be done by a number of means: A. Timelessness Most people have had experiences where time seems to stand still or where life seems to be complete in a single moment. It can be a moment of great personal meaningfulness, such as a near-fatal accident or a moment of love (Joan Baez sings, "Speaking strictly for me, I could have died right then..."); or it can be an epiphany in a completely ordinary moment, such as walking down the street. Tibetan Buddhism calls this other way of knowing time "the fourth moment" ( Tib. dus bzhi pa). A Course in Miracles tries to bring something like this sense of time into a Christian context. The fourth moment might be meditatively (completely inadequately) described as the direct knowing that time as such does not exist, or that it happens/happened all at once, or that it never actually happened as it seems, or that each instant is fresh, new, unique, and pure, born afresh with no past, from a timeless source. The visual arts are, in some sense, inherently atemporal. Although visual exploration occurs over time, painting, sculpture or other mediums have the potential to strike the viewer with sufficient force and vividness to momentarily cut through the conceptual mind with its ongoing temporality. Verbal narratives, which by definition unfold through time, have various devices for collapsing time. One means is the climax (Oedipus gives an SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="13">248 Eleanor Rosch earthshaking cry and tears out his eyes). Or the entire plot may be drawn together in a denouement-even good mystery stories do this. Or there may be a moment, perhaps even in one's recollection of the work, in which the perfection of the form of the piece strikes one vividly (as with, perhaps, Silas Marner or the film Rashomon.) Music may work with time in ways analogous to narrative. For example, many pieces of classical music have narrative- like climaxes, and the constraints on these can be interestingly informative. Many years ago a recording was released called Great Moments in Music. It contained the death music from La Boheme, the death music from the Romeo and Juliet ballet, the climax at the end of the Emperor Concerto, and so on. It was ludicrous! Perhaps we need "the whole catastrophe" stretched out in time in order to collapse time, which brings a sense of completeness (in Taoist terms "rectification") to the world of phenomena, the feeling that "justifies God's ways to men." B. Realness Our culture (according to various pundits) is haunted by feelings of disconnectedness and unreality. Certainly there is an infatuation with attempts to "get real." This is often pursued by the doubtful means of intense sensory stimulation or risk-taking behavior. One might expect that indulgence in the arts would contribute to feelings of unreality, and sometimes it does, yet almost everyone can recall experiences that were just the opposite--e.g., where contact with a fictional representation left them feeling more alive, real, and "themselves." How can this be? Buddhist mindfulness practice is about being present, and one of the first things noticed by mindfulness practitioners is how non-present they generally are. Part of the feeling of unreality is that people spend their lives in memory, wishes, narrative, plans, autobiography, conceptualization- anything but their present situation. What is the alternative? People often interpret "mindfulness" to mean watching what one is doing as though one were an observer of oneself. Although this is still observing through the habitual dualistic abstractions of the mind, it is considered a necessary stage by some meditation teachers and for some people, a stage in which the heedless dualism of habitual mind-wandering may be somewhat replaced by the exaggerated sense of a conscious present-oriented watcher. Art works also can capture and hold the attention of viewer or reader as though representing a present witness. In the meditation context (and perhaps in appreciation of the arts), creating an observer is a stepping stone to the more direct mode of knowing self and world in which there is no separate watcher. SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="14">Space to Fly 249 Knowing in the fourth moment is said to be direct and unfiltered. It bypasses one's personal egoistic story. Artists themselves talk about seeing nature and people directly in a way that is vivid, ungraspable, even "authentic." Paradoxically, it may be knowing that one is not actually living in the imaginary world of the artwork that allows the viewer or reader to likewise momentarily bypass his personal ego story and thereby feel more directly the reality portrayed through the artist's vision. C. Freedom Freedom is a potent wqrd, a rallying cry that has fueled much of human life from socio-political movements to the theology of free will to mid-life crises. People are willing to die for freedom. But what is it? Psychology and cognitive science seek determinate accounts of the mind. What could ever give humans an idea such as freedom? According to accounts in later Buddhism, in the timeless direct knowing of the fourth moment, each experience is seen just as it is, with nothing "underneath," and no necessary implications. Not boxed in by concepts or by the habitual mind, it is inherently open and free. (This is part of what may be pointed to by the Buddhist concept of emptiness.) In both the formal and the informal arts, there are many devices for inducing a moment of freedom; humor is one of the most immediate ways. Laughter releases! Hearing about people who had everything but still felt miserable seems to release us, explaining our fascination with both tales of tortured movie stars and with the life of Buddha. For that matter, shock itself releases. In real life, we may be too busy coping with the implications of the shocker to notice the open instant, but think of the effect of the juxtaposition of images in a haiku, or even those beloved scenes in classic horror movies where the audience screams. D. Inherent Value This is the heart of the matter. The values spoken of in our social and cognitive sciences, in morality, in humanism, and in many aspects of organized religion are conditional values: survival and reproduction versus extinction, pleasure versus pain; success versus failure, good versus bad. Yet there is the haunting intuition that there is something more than that (or less, if you will). Humans have a sense of the unconditional, for example the concept of unconditional love-how many westerners blame their mothers for not having given it to them (or, now with advances in sexual equality, their fathers too)? How many theological wrangles in Western SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="15">250 Eleanor Rosch religions have been generated by the need to reconcile the illusive intuition of an unconditional God with the conceptual demands of conditional anthropomorphic imagery? The three major meditation traditions (Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism) contain teachings that explicitly point beyond conditionality. Tibetan Buddhism proclaims a primordial wisdom that is "not fabricated by mind;" Zen speaks of original mind and "no mind;" most Mahayana Buddhism contains the doctrine of "Buddha nature;" Taoism talks about the Tao or the "Source;" and Hinduism has the "Self"(Katagiri, 1988; Kohn,1993; Sogyal, 1993; Tsognyi, 1998; Vivekananda, 1993). Most agree that this is our original, natural, fundamental state, what we are right now, not any particular or special experience. When we realize this wisdom, it is said that the phenomenal world, including the false sense of self and all the other problems and degradations of life, are known as the timeless perfect radiance of that basic ground. Be that as it may, most long term meditators (as well as POWs and the like) do report that they are kept going by some illusive sense of basic, unconditional positiveness. The problem with this primordial unconditionality is that, since it is not a separate thing and not any particular or special experience, it cannot be found or known by any of our usual ways of looking or knowing. It cannot be an object of the senses or of thought since senses and their objects are part of it, and it cannot be the end result of striving for a goal since the goal is already achieved. One traditional image is that it is like looking for a lost horse that you cannot find because you are already riding it. Herein lies the effectiveness of the arts. Riding the lost horse consists of the activities of life itself in all its various manifestations. That is what the arts present. In daily life even as one strains towards values projected outward, the arts can portray that very life in a way that whispers that to be alive and mortal and have experience already has inherent value. Such can be conveyed by large and small alike-from Shakespeare's King Lear bellowing to the "oak-cleaving thunderbolts" to Buson's Sparrow singing - its tiny mouth Open. (Haas, 87) IV. Conclusion I have tried to show how the imaginative arts, at their best, can function not only as useful for evolutionary tasks but also as a release from the habitual modes of feeling, thinking, and acting that accompany a life focused on such evolutionarily useful tasks. Some of the Eastern psychologies would SubStance # 94/95, 2001</page><page sequence="16">Space to Fly 251 suggest that this release is to an underlying "primordial" form of self knowledge. The nature of such self-knowledge and how the arts might evoke it was elaborated in the various categories of the paper. This argument has several further implications. As the Eastern meditation traditions come into western cultures, meditation is practiced more and more in lay life, rather than in monastic settings. Thus there is much discussion of "the yoga of everyday life." The arts, it was suggested here, already have a genius for presenting daily life in all its manifestations in such a way that these manifestations can be glimpsed as what meditators might call "wisdom mind at play " Present day meditators might well contemplate the arts for pointers, well polished by centuries of use, on what a yoga of daily life could mean practically. Psychology and cognitive science are also supposedly about real people and real minds, yet from the point of view of the Eastern psychologies, what they have so far studied is only the habitual "surface" mind. I have tried to show in this paper how the arts may provide clues to a different, more inclusive, and perhaps more basic, psychology. In the last analysis, this distinction (between the two modes of psychology) is perhaps best expressed by Rumi: Subtle degrees of domination and servitude are what you know as love. But to love is different. It arrives complete Just there Like the moon in the window (Vaughan-Lee, 1998, audio) Einstein said that problems can never be solved with the same mind that created them. Maybe our cognitive science needs the arts.
