<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Anthropologist NEW SERIES VOL. 26 JULY-SEPTEMBER, 1924 No. 3 THIIE SEQUENCE OF CULTURES IN MEXICO1 BY MANUEL GAMIO THE CULTURES of pre-Hispanic America are probably branches of a primitive mother culture which became dif- ferentiated in various aspects and attained diverse grades in evolution according to special climatic and geographic environ- ments in different parts of the continent. Reliable modern investigators have arrived at an opinion with which I think this audience will agree--that American man did not originate in this continent, but that he began to emigrate to this continent during the early part of the Neolithic period and brought with him expressions of an elementary culture. I shall not discuss from the chronological standpoint the date of this important occurrence since that does not touch the heart of our problem. Until now, archaeological research has been done in reverse order; that is, it has gone from the complex to the simple or elementary, since it seemed preferable first to investigate those phases in which derived civilizations flourished in all their differ- entiations; while study of the mother or primitive culture, as well as of the intensely interesting frst steps toward differentiation, has been neglected. It is therefore necessary to begin a parallel investigation in reverse order, proceeding in an ascending line from the elementary to the complex or from the mother culture to its derivatives. This study can be made from five points of view. 1 Address delivered at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, April 17, 1924. 307</page><page sequence="2">308 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 First, we should locate the original home of Neolithic culture before its emigration to America, and determine its distinctive characteristics. Second, we must ascertain in what parts of the United States and Canada vestiges of this culture still exist in the Neolithic state and in the most primitive stages of its development in America. This task naturally belongs to specialists in the United States and Canada. I am presuming that such vestiges can be found in those countries, since it is probable that during the longer or transient periods that Neolithic man was there, he could not have acquired any noticeable degree of culture on account of the rigorous climate, as in the case of the Eskimo. This view is supported by the fact that, with the exception of the "Pueblos," who really belong to the Mexican archaeological region, the pre- Hispanic cultures of the United States and Canada are primitive and inferior in degree of development to the cultures of Mexico. The third aspect of the ascending investigation which we are discussing should be to determine the mother culture from which the other pre-Hispanic civilizations of Mexico are derived and whether this culture is the same, at a more advanced stage, as the Neolithic one presumably existing in the north. We must discard from the outset old fantastic traditions told by ancient chroniclers about giants or "quinames" supposed to be the forefathers of American man. These suppositions were based upon the discovery of pieces of skeletons of enormous fossil animals. The pseudo-scientific discoveries of the Man of Pefion or the Man of Tequixquiac were equally erroneous. In fact, human bones and archaeological vestiges found thus far in Mexico provide only relative knowledge of the first groups inhabiting Mexican territory. The bones found and studied scientifically prove that there existed a modern type of man similar to the present Indian. From the point of view of archaeological arts and industries, we find that almost all the pre-Hispanic cultures produced simultan- eously the chipped stone characteristics of the Palheolithic industries, the polished stone of the Neolithic, and architecture, pictorial decorations and sculpture similar to those of the historic civilizations. This fact renders it impossible to make a chrono-</page><page sequence="3">GAMIO] THE SEQUENCE OF CULTURES IN MEXICO 309 logical classification in accordance with the clearly defined and differentiated stages presented by the archaeological industries of Europe. On the other hand, migrations and cultural contacts were so numerous, as well as intensive and extensive, that it is difficult to find a place in which various cultures have not been established either simultaneously or in different periods; and, since these cultures have nearly always exercised a mutual in- fluence, the problem of determining the antiquity of each becomes very complex. In the future, the stratigraphic method will contribute toward determination of the oldest Mexican culture; but so far the determination has been impossible. Since we lack a chronological reference chart, we do not know how much time elapsed during the formation of the sediment deposited over cultural vestiges. The Department of Anthropology of Mexico has made two stratigraphic studies; though these unfortunately have only a limited value. The first is of Tenoxtitlan, the ancient capital, whose pavements and architectural ruins are found at an average depth of five meters below the present City of Mexico. In this case, it is evident that these five meters of sedimentary deposit correspond to four centuries. Nevertheless, this fact does not have definite scientific value because the deposit is the result not only of natural causes such as water and wind, but also of human activities which have played a large part in its formation, since much of it is made up of the ruins of destroyed temples and other extraneous material. The other study is that of the strata deposited during four hundred years in the Valley of Teotihuacan. In order to find their depth, excavations were made near the walls of some colonial churches to the depth of the basement foundations which had been buried since the sixteenth century. The different levels found in a small number of excavations forbade generalization regarding the whole valley because the hardened sub-soil upon which the deposit had been formed varied so much in direction, inclination, etc., that some deposits were very deep and others shallow although all had been formed during the same lapse of time.</page><page sequence="4">310 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 A fortunate accident made it possible for the Department of Anthropology to determine that the culture in the valley of Mexico known as the Archaic is the oldest in the country and probably the mother culture of Mexico. For fifteen or twenty years statuettes and vessels of this Archaic type had been found in various parts of the country, especially in the valley of Mexico. In stratigraphic excavations in Atzcapotzalco from 1912 to 1915, made by the author under the auspices of the International School of American Archaeology and Ethnology, it was found on two occasions that the strata of Archaic culture were below those of Teotihuacan and Aztec cultures, from which fact the general- ization was deduced that the Archaic was the oldest in the Valley of Mexico. On the other hand, in other excavations the Teotihua- can and Archaic appeared in the same strata, and sometimes the Aztec likewise. Later it was observed that in nearly all the quarries which furnish rock of Volcanic origin for buildings in the Capital, human remains and potsherds were frequently found, and upon investigations these vestiges were discovered in greater abundance in the Copilco quarry of the Pedregal at San Angel; so various tunnels were made under the lava flow at a depth of seven meters. The results were intensely interesting since it was found that all of the statuettes and vessels were of Archaic type. Secondary tunnels were afterward dug in quarries at Coyoacan and Tlalpam and it was proven that in all the region covered by the lava flow a large human group with Archaic civilization existed Fprior to the volcanic erupti6n. Finally, in collaboration with the Department of Anthropology, Dr. Byron Cummings discovered a pyramid and many objects of Archaic type .near Tlalpam. So, the fact that within a comparatively extensive area abundant cultural vestiges of Archaic type are found to the exclusion of other cultures,.and the circumstance that the Archaic vestiges show no influence of other cultures, indicate conclusively that the Archaic culture was the first to appear in the valley of Mexico and is consequently the oldest one. If there had been others in the same place or even more remote regions, they would neces- sarily have mixed with the Archaic and influenced it, as happened many centuries after the volcanic eruption when the Aztec and</page><page sequence="5">GAMIo] THE SEQUENCE OF CULTURES IN MEXICO 311 Teotihuacan cultures arrived in the Valley from the North and fused with the Archaic which had survived the eruption. Now, then, is this Archaic culture the same which came into America during the early part of the Neolithic period? Un- doubtedly, it is not, as I shall demonstrate. Archaic vestiges in the Pedregal discovered thus far consist of vessels, many of which are decorated in polychrome, and anthropomorphic statu- ettes, showing great variety in headdress as well as in collars, earrings, bracelets and, occasionally, skirts which seem to be made of feathers or leaves. The cheeks of some of the little heads are rouged. Two statuettes represent the gods of water and fire and are similar to those of the same gods of the Teotihuacan culture which succeeded the Archaic, as will be proven. In architecture, the Archaic groups were builders of great monu- ments which are archetypes of the pyramids of other cultures. Some maize-grinding stones or metates and manos are worthy of mention among their industrial objects, analogous as they are to those of other cultures; this, with the burnt ears of maize found, indicates an agricultural people who knew something of the cultivation of plants. Can a people of such cultural advance- ment belong to the early Neolithic period when the first emigration to America began? Undoubtedly, they do not; and many centuries must have passed from the time when Neolithic man found himself face to face for the first time with virgin America, to that era in which he had become transformed into planter, builder, and artist. While the Archaic type is culturally inferior to other Mexican civilizations, it represents an evolutionary stratum superior to the cultures of the United States and Canada. We believe, therefore, that there is some ground for our supposition that the links connecting the Archaic or Sub-Pedregal man with Neolithic man as he immigrated into the Americas are to be found in these two countries; so it is logical that Mexican specialists should devote their activities to the study of archaeological material actually existing, and not to that of Neolithic vestiges whose existence is problematical. The fourth step ihi the ascending investigation consists in determining the characteristics of the Archaic or mother culture,</page><page sequence="6">312 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 26, 1924 especially determining its relation to its derived cultures and to those with which it came in contact. Before entering upon the material, I will state that very few of the concepts and conclusions which follow are the result of the reduced amount of archaeo- logical literature of the past decade but rather are deductions based upon investigations made by the Mexican government in various parts of the country during that period of time. I say this in order to assume responsibility for all errors and I shall be grateful to have my attention called to such in order that they may be corrected. ARCHAIC CULTURE The relatively well defined area covered by this culture is large, comprising the Federal District and the states of Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, Guerrero, Jalisco, Colima, and Tepic. In other places not yet explored, such as Guanajuato and Queretaro, are groups of Otomis who, according to all in- dications, are direct descendants of the Archaics, so it is more than likely that vestiges of the culture could be found in those states also. The pictures herewith2 show objects of Archaic type found under the lava bed of the Pedregal and already described. An examination of them confirms us in the opinion that this place is the oldest known seat of Archaic culture, since they are much more primitive and less developed artistically and industrially than are those, for instance, of Hidalgo, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Morelos and even other parts of the valley of Mexico; while those of Colima, Jalisco, and Michoacan have reached a still higher stage of evolution. In view of this, I shall repeat a suggestion made some time ago; that it would be well to establish an artistic and industrial exhibit of objects found or hereafter discovered beneath the bed of the Pedregal. The cultural type of Archaic objects found in other regions could thus be classified more easily and their grade in the evolutionary scale determined by comparison with those 2 Not reproduced here, but displayed at the Carnegie Institution of Washington.</page><page sequence="7">GAMIOj THE SEQUENCE OF CULTURES IN MEXICO 313 of the Pedregal. This is especially necessary in reference to architecture, and, with the archaic pyramids of the Pedregal as a pattern, numerous monuments in Michoacan, Jalisco and other states known popularly as "yacatas", "momoxtles", "tlalteles", etc., can be classified according to their stage of culture. For the same reason it will be well to adopt the term "Sub-Pedregal Culture" for this type, since the word "Archaic" connotes an- tiquity but possesses no specific significance. Archaic culture probably has many derivatives, but I shall cite the particular case of the Teotihuacan or "Toltec" phase because I have been able to verify certain things regarding that culture, as follows. The Archaic groups lived in the valley chosen by the pre-Teotihuacanos from the north as the site of their famous city, as is proven by the fact that Archaic objects and fragments, as well as complete figurines in clay and stone, are frequently found in the adobe with which they built; and objects of this type have been found in the most recent excavations in this region generally. From the fusion of Archaic and Teotihuacan, resulted the Toltec or Teotihuacan culture, as is.demonstrated by the large number of Teotihuacan statuettes that have their prototypes among those of Archaic affiliation. The most interesting example is that of the sculptural representation of the Teotihuacan gods of water and fire which clearly identify with corresponding prototypes among the Archaic statuettes. I think that it is well to state that in the archaeological nomenclature recently adopted by the Department_'of Anthro- pology, we have discarded the term "Tarascan" which lacks specific significance and which has been employed-to indicate pre-Hispanic vestiges existing in large quantities in :Colima, Tepic, Jalisco, and Michoacan, for these vestiges belong funda- mentally to the Archaic type but represent a much more advanced stage than that observed in the Valley of Mexico and probably were influenced by other cultures. Thus far, I have set forth the archaeological point of view that the Archaic culture is the oldest in the Valley of Mexico and probably in the whole country. Now, the majority of colonial</page><page sequence="8">314 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 26, 1924 and modern authors hold the opinion that the Otomi were the oldest inhabitants of the Valley, and base this theory upon historic traditions. I hold that the Archaics and Otomis were one and the same group. The fact that the present indigenes of Jalisco and Michoacan speak Tarascan, although living in regions that archaeologically are Archaic, does not nullify the argument; their speaking Tarascan may be due to contacts between the A rchaics and emigrants whose language they adopted. Although I am opposed to making hypothetical chronological estimates, I am obliged in this case to say two things regarding the antiquity which I attribute to the Archaic culture of the Pedregal. I wish to make it plain that what I say has nothing to do with extravagant conjectures written along this line, some of which go to the extreme of stating that the Archaic vestiges of Pedregal date as far back as twenty or thirty thousand years; these opinions being based upon fantastic archaeological consider- ations and vague geologic calculations regarding the antiquity of the volcanic eruption in the Pedregal. For my part, I believe that no culture in Mexico dates farther back than the early Neo- lithic period when man first emigrated to America. In the case of the Pedregal, permit me to suggest that the antiquity of cultural vestiges found there is not less than four thousand years, since the Archaic was the direct antecedent of the Teotihuacan culture, and to that, as we shall see later, I attribute an antiquity of more than three thousand years. As a matter of course, these statements are purely hypothetical and in no sense to be taken as scientific determinations. Having finished this exposition of Archaic culture, I must explain that I gave it ample space in this lecture because it deserves such as the mother culture of Mexico, and because, the more thorough the knowledge of it, the more rapid will be the advance of investigation of the cultures which issued from it. TEOTIHUACAN CULTURE For a long time the manifestations of a certain cultural type which had not been clearly identified were vaguely called "Tol- tec", among other reasons, because the only available sources of</page><page sequence="9">GAMIO] THE SEQUENCE OF CULTURES IN MEXICO 315 information being documentary the material vestiges of that civilization were unknown. As a result, the main and almost exclusive tendency was along the line of investigation of the intellectual expressions of Toltec culture, such as its religious ideas, ethics, aesthetics, while almost nothing was known about its architecture, ceramics, domestic and industrial implements. Happily, the Department of Anthropology had the oppor- tunity to explore and investigate for several years throughout an extensive region in which vestiges of the latter class exist, and as a result, one of the main deductions is that the archaeological city of Teotihuacan was the center in which remains of the so- called Toltec type were centered in the most harmonious and typical way. For this reason, it is fitting to indicate as "Teoti- huacan type" the culture which until now has been known as Toltec. The origin of this culture, as we said above, appears to have been the result of the fusion of Archaic culture with another brought from the North by the pre-Teotihuacans. Sculpture of Teotihuacan type, as well as pyramidal construction, has proto- types in Archaic culture. On the other hand, the use of buttresses, doors and stairs, of cement for walls and floors, etc., was probably imported from the North, probably from the Transition or Chalchihuites culture which in turn appropriated elements from that of the "Pueblos". Later, I shall take up the question of the evolution of Teotihuacan culture. The exact antiquity of this culture is not known, but a relative date can be fixed. In general, I think, it antedates the Maya culture whose oldest vestiges are, according to reliable opinions, of the beginning of the Christian era. Now, the Teotihuacan culture shows no Maya influence, while the reverse is true, as can be seen in Chichen-Itza where the touch of Teotihuacan or Teotihuacan-Aztec culture is visible. Since it may be argued that Chichen-Itza belongs to the sixth century of the Christian era, I shall give more convincing reasons. Teotihuacan culture is a direct descendant of Archaic, while Maya is not. Therefore, if Archaic culture is the oldest in Mexico, clearly its most direct descendant is older than Maya culture. It is possible that in</page><page sequence="10">316 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 future excavations in the Maya area, Archaic vestiges which are the prototypes of Maya culture may be found; but this does not seem likely to occur because Maya civilization represents a more advanced stage in cultural evolution than does Teoti- huacan, so that it is more logical to infer that its prototypes will be found in the latter rather than directly in Archaic culture. If it is admitted that Maya culture began to unfold during the early part of the Christian era and that this stage required a preparation of five hundred years, it would not be an exaggera- tion to estimate that Teotihuacan culture began, developed, and disintegrated during a still earlier period of a thousand years or more, which leads to the hypothesis that its antiquity dates back as far as three thousand five hundred to four thousand years. Research of stratigraphic and architectural nature into the culture of the archaeological city of Teotihuacan, which, as I have said, is the most typical, has made it clear that there were two great flourishing periods followed by corresponding periods of decadence and dispersion. In the archaeological zone of Teotihuacan we deal with more than one city; there are vestiges of two, one built above the other and belonging to two different and clearly defined epochs, though of the same general cultural type, which was apparently in full flower in the first, but decadent in the second. I believe, for reasons which time will not permit stating here, that the city of Teotihuacan was the famous Tula of historic tradition. According to data and observation we may attribute the same extension to Teotihuacan culture as to Archaic, with certain variations. For example the latter flourished in Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan, Tepic and Colima, while vestiges of the Teotihuacan culture in those places are scarce. But generally, the two are found in the same regions above mentioned. Just as Archaic culture is the antecedent of the Teotihuacan, the latter is in its turn the antecedent of the Aztec, especially in matters relating to intellectual culture such as religious ideas, ethics, aesthetics, as well as social institutions. On the other hand, its influence is much less seen in material things; archi- tecture, sculpture, decorative arts and even domestic and indus-</page><page sequence="11">GAMIO] THE SEQUENCE OF CULTURES IN MEXICO 317 trial implements of Aztec type have their own well-defined characteristics. I make special note of this because the reverse is frequently true-that ideas are less easily influenced than are material expressions of culture. It is probable that the first Aztec migrations found the city of Teotihuacan practically in ruins while the surviving inhabitants clung to their ancient ideas. It will give some notion of the persistence of Aztec art to cite the instance of the ceramic remains of this type found in strati- graphic excavations in Teotihuacan. These appear in very small quantity in the deepest strata side by side with large quantities of Teotihuacan ceramics; and the same Aztec decorative motifs appear in the ceramics of strata of a very much later period. Since I am dealing in this lecture with concepts not very well known, I shall not refer to other aspects of Teotihuacan civiliza- tion which have been set forth in "La Poblacion del Valle de Teotihuacan", a work published two years ago by the Direccion de Antropologia. AZTEC CULTURE Aztec culture extended over a larger area than did the Archaic and Teotihuacan, but was less intensive than the Archaic in Tepic, Michoacan, Jalisco, and Colima. There are vestiges of it in Mitla and probably as far south as Central America. The Maya culture appears to have been greatly influenced by the Aztec and Aztec-Teotihuacan, as can be seen in Chichen-Itza and other places. While the problem of its antiquity has not been solved, ap- parently, as I have said, the most important immigrations arrived in the valley as the Teotihuacan civilization disintegrated, although it is certain that a small number of individuals of Aztec culture came with the first Teotihuacan people to the valley of that name, as is proven by the stratigraphic excavations to which I have alluded. Aztec culture has been studied extensively, especially in its intellectual phases as illustrated in codices and by ceramics. So I shall limit myself to making a few supplementary observa- tions. According to the Album of the International School of</page><page sequence="12">318 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 Archaeology and Ethnology and the Text to that volume, the oldest ceramic ware of Aztec type in the Valley of Mexico is found in Culhuacan. It is well known that for fanatic reasons the Spanish con- querors followed the policy of destroying the temples and buildings of the Indians, as well as that the latter, in self-protection, covered their undestroyed pyramids with earth and other materials, so that virtually nothing was known of Aztec structures. Con- sequently, from an architectural viewpoint, the recent uncovering of pyramids of Aztec type, which are the first to be known, has made possible the communication of some interesting new features. The Aztec and Teotihuacan pyramids differ in many respects. The first has two ascending stairways while the latter has only one. The corners of the Aztec pyramid are built of massive squared stones and the decoration of the mass of the pyramid is very simple, consisting of a mixture of lime-smoothed clay, while the Teotihuacan structures have high reliefs cut in stone, or done in fine stucco and colored red. All of these pyramids are built of several layers, which doubtless correspond to the suc- cessive groups which used them as temples. I shall not go into further detail for fear of making this lecture too long. The pyramids mentioned are, first of all, the one dedicated to Huitzilopoxtli and Tlaloc, gods of war and rain, the ruins of which were discovered in the heart of Mexico City. The Spanish conquerors destroyed the upper stories but the lower ones are still standing, as well as the staircases and inclined walls belonging to different epochs. The Cuernavaca pyramid is remarkable in that the walls of the temple are still standing on the top platform, although the roof has disappeared. The one in San Bartolo Naucalpam shows a colonial superstructure. Besides these there are those of Tenayuca and Mixcoac. MAYA CULTURE This civilization extends over a wide zone which includes the District of Quintana Roo and the States of Yucatan, Campeche, Tabasco, Chiapas and a part of Vera Cruz. The influence of this</page><page sequence="13">GAMIo] THE SEQUENCE OF CULTURES IN MEXICO 319 civilization reaches probably as far as Tamaulipas to that tract of coast land which limits the eastern Sierra Madre. This influence is also clearly seen in Oaxaca, and even in Tehuacan of the state of Puebla, and in Xochicalco, Morelos. It is probable that both Archaic and Aztec cultures were influenced by the Maya in the land along the western coast. There is very little to say about this civilization that is not already known, since many investigators, especially of the United States, have published extensive studies regarding it. It is to be hoped that the interesting investigations proposed by the Carnegie Institution will bring to light many obscure phases of this culture. I take the liberty of suggesting to students of the Maya problem, that they first inquire whether it is true, as I believe it is, that the prototypes of the Maya culture are Teotihua- can and Archaic. And what was the relation of the Archaic culture to Mayan? And, finally, it is of greatest importance to make a wide and careful stratigraphic investigation in those regions where the depth of the sediment deposit allows it, as it will not in the greater part of Yucatan. MIXTEC-ZAPOTEC CULTURE The Department of Anthropology has begun an integral investigation of the inhabitants of Oaxaca during three periods: pre-Hispanic, colonial and contemporary, but so far there are no data to give you. The pre-Hispanic inter-cultural problem is the one which will absorb our primary attention. We think, a priori, that in the Mixtec-Zapotec culture appears a fusion of the Maya, the Aztec, and the Teotihuacan, and base our opinion upon the Maya influence noted in the architecture and ceramics of Monte Alban. In Mitla, not only the mural frescoes have an Aztec character, but Aztec influence is also seen in the decorations of the mural reliefs. And finally we have many times found Zapotec vases of Teotihuacan type. HUAXTEC-TOTONAC CULTURE The little that has been studied and published regarding this civilization has-such small scientific value that it would be</page><page sequence="14">320 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 26, 1924 useless to draw conclusions. Of this culture, which seems to have been influenced strongly by the Maya, all that we have in the way of archaeological material consists of the Tajin Pyramid, some stone "palmas" and "yokes", ceramics in Vera Cruz, vases and statuettes in Tamaulipas and a few mounds or "cues" CHALCHIHUITES OR TRANSITION CULTURE We designate this civilization "transition" because it rep- resents a transition or intermediate epoch between the southern and the northern or "Pueblo" cultures. Its representative and most typical center is in Chalchihuites, Zacatecas. It probably extends throughout Durango, Zacatecas, Jalisco, Michoacan, and Aguas Calientes to the boundary of the western Sierra Madre. We have no data regarding its antiquity. The architecture of the cultures already described presents the pyramidal structure and the use of the inclined plane for foundations and cornices, as its most striking characteristics. These are not found in the architecture of Chalchihuites, although it has in common with these southern cultures such things as stairways, columns, battlements, and other architectural features. The architecture of the "Pueblos" differs from the southern in using neither pyramidal construction nor inclined planes and from the Transition in having no stairs, columns, etc. The analogy between the architecture of the "Pueblos" and the Transition consists among other things in the use of flag-stones and large sun-dried bricks as building materials, as well as in the application of a coat of mud to the walls, followed by another thin coat of "white-wash" mixed with clay, which gave a more or less polished finish. A careful examination of the architecture of the Transition and Teotihuacan cultures reveals such a close analogy that one is led to ask whether the first is the archetype or the decadent derivation of the second, in spite of the fact that they differ in regard to pyramids and inclined planes. Transition ceramic ware presents three typical groups: First, the polychrome of cloisonn6 technique in which the design was delicately traced on the vase and then filled with colored clay. This is surely a prototype of the famous Teotihuacan ceramic</page><page sequence="15">GAMIO] THE SEQUENCE OF CULTURES IN MEXICO 321 or else a decadent phase of it. The second type is inlaid pottery, in which the design was drawn on the vessel before the clay was dry, and then filled in with colored clay. The ceramic ware of the third group is glazed and has painted decorations. In its decorative character, this ware seems to bear an analogy to the "Pueblo" art. PUEBLO CULTURE This culture extends throughout Chihuahua, Coahuila and perhaps Nuevo Leon. It would be vanity on my part to speak at length upon a culture which has received so much consideration at the hands of North American specialists. So I mention it only to say that its ceramics present an analogy in decoration to the Archaic, and I believe that its architecture and that of the Archaic of the Valley of Mexico are the original sources of all other archaeological architecture in Mexico. RESEARCH WORKJIN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA The fifth step in the ascending investigation should consist in following the migration of North American civilization toward Central and South America and in finding what differentiation it experienced in coming in touch with new geographic, climatic, botanical and zoological conditions. The study of the isthmian region, principally that of the Panama Republic, is of great value because in that small area there probably exist a great quantity and variety of traces of these successive emigrant cultures. A careful and extensive stratigraphic investigation of the whole region, making one or two hundred excavations, wpuld do much toward the solution of this most important problem. FUSION OF ASCENDING AND DESCENDING INVESTIGATIONS As soon as the study of the mother culture of America and its derivatives has been made, it will be an easy matter to link the knowledge thus obtained with what we already possess and shall gain in the future regarding the higher cultures.</page><page sequence="16">322 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 Then we shall really know the cultural attainments of the pre-Ilispanic indigenous race; we shall be able to deduce the causes of passive degeneration during the colonial epoch and modern times, and apply an effective system of. redemption in the Indian's behalf that shall lead to his participation in modern life. Before closing this lecture, I would like to suggest as a possible solution of the five great archaeological problems just set forth, the uniting of the specialists of the continent in a well worked out plan which shall lead to harmonized, convergent, and positive results.
