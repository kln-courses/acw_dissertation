Pp. xv, 174. This book on child development and training, written by an English author but drawing most 'of its experimental material from American sources, adds little to present-day knowledge or understanding of the topics with which it deals. The point of view is a curious mixture of psychoanalytical theory and popular anthropomorphism. It is said, for example, that the young infant may "feel anger toward his mother if she gives too little milk or if he is not helped to 'get the wind up' after a feed" (p. 14) and that "the very young child builds strange phantasies about his food-in his mind it is either very beneficial or very harmful, like nectar or like poison" (p. 20). The psychoanalytical explanation of</page><page sequence="2">156 BOOK REVIEWS the difficulties encountered in early toilet training as due to the infant's regarding urine and faeces as "something precious to be given to the mother or as something bad and destructive which may harm his mother" (p. 15) is accepted without question. An attempt at objectivity is made by frequent citation of standards of development taken from various sources. For the most part, however, these descriptions are too abbreviated to be serviceable as norms and too poorly organized to provide a meaningful picture of developmental se- quences. Lists such as those on page 29, in which it is stated that at two years the child can "build a tower of six bricks" without specifying the size or shape of the bricks, while at three years he can "copy a circle" and at five years can "copy a star" without reference to the standard of excel- lence to be expected, are as likely to mislead as to inform. The glossary (pp. 169-170) would have been greatly improved had the author seen fit to consult an ordinary dictionary. Guilt is defined as "a feeling of blame"; metabolic as "relating to digestion." Just how much information is gained by being told that visual perception means "the art of perceiving by sight" is not clear to me, while the definition of cretin as "a type of mental defective with small stature and rough skin" certainly misses the point. By far the most interesting part of the book is the chapter on Children and the War. Written in 1942 in the midst of the German air raids, the material has the vividness and freshness of first-hand data on a topic of intense personal concern. The verbatim copies of child essays on such topics as "How I feel when the sirens go" and "Things I miss most in wartime" throw much light on children's thinking as well as on child reactions to emotional stress. It is regrettable that more space was not devoted to this material, for which a considerable proportion of the trite rehashing of adult exposition might well have been sacrificed.
