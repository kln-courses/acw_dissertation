Ouvrage accompagne d'une heliogravure et de 600 dessins. Paris. Firmin-Didot. 1894. 10 frcs. UNTIL quite recently the Berlin Beschreibung der antiken Skulpturen was the only example of an official catalogue which aimed at fur- nishing illustrations of every object contained in the collection described. The catalogue now published by M. S. Reinach of the figured bronzes in the Mus6e de St. Germain is welcome as the first step towards the fulfilment of Professor Kekule's prophecy that the exception of Berlin would come in time to be the rule. M. Reinach not only reproduces 600 drawings (190 of which we owe to his own skilful pencil), but in a charming dedicatory letter to M. Bertrand gives a number of practical hints for the production of cheap yet adequate zinco- gravure. Every earnest student will be grateful to M. Reinach for the vigour with which he protests not only against non- illustrated catalogues, but against the eclectic method of illustration, and insists upon the necessity of representing the whole of a collection from its most important down to its apparently most insignificant object. For in the first place, as De Morgan long ago observed, no man's selection of know- ledge is ever another man's; and in the second, to quote our author, no one possesses an infallible criterion whereby to determine the value of objects, ' telle statuette qui</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 137 n'arretera pas un instant le regard d'un archeologue pourra fournir a un autre le point de depart d'une recherche fructueuse.' If only compilers of catalogues would lay this to heart, what precious time would they not save students, by allowing them to know beforehand what to expect of a collection. An illustrated catalogue however cannot be more than a rough guide for those who have not yet seen a collection, or a convenient memorandum for those who have; it cannot take the place of ocular examination or even of photographs. It answers well for objects that have little artistic value and are inter- esting only as types, but it would be fatal to draw aesthetic conclusions from the caricatured reproduction for instance of the beautiful Blacas warrior (no. 182). But I am anticipating. Neither the actual catalogue nor the illustrations should cause one to overlook the Introductory Essay in which, in his usual brilliant and incisive style, the author establishes the origin and character of Gallo-Roman art. In accordance with phenomena already partially indicated by Th. Schreiber, he recognizes that Greek influence made itself felt in Gaul mainly through the forms of Graeco-Egyptian art, which were im- ported not only through Italy, but directly as a consequence of the relations between Graeco-Roman Egypt and the valley of the Rhone. Hence the numerous Alexandrine mnotifs-negroes, pygmies, children wrapped up in cloaks with pointed hoods, genre caricatures-that meet us at every turn in Gallic art. Hence also (a fact of the highest importance to the student of mythology) the types of the Gaulish gods. The type of ' Dispater' M. Reinach clearly shows to be borrowed from Sara pis, while the curious crouching or squatting god whose origin has given rise to so much controversy he doubt- less rightly derives from the Egyptian Imhotep, in opposition to the current view which seeks his prototype in the crouching god of India. With regard to the whole of this complicated question we miss some reference to the labours of Prof. Rhys (Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion in Celtic Heathendom, 1888). In his searching analysis of the myth, Rhys, who makes express mention of the Cernunnos of Autun (Reinach, no. 177), points out the connexion of the squatting god with the Norse Heimdal the 'god's warder,' 'whose teeth are of gold' (op. cit. 'the Gaulish Pantheon,' pp. 78 sqq.). The gold teeth, symbol of metallic wealth, and the epithet 'god's warder' seem to prove that we have in Heimdal and Cernunnos the survivors of an older race of gods displaced by a new Pantheon. The old gods are retained partly as servants of the new gods, while, like the dwarfs of the Niebelungen, who are an instance of a similar survival, part of their functions is to toil in the bowels of the earth. The catalogue is agreeably interrupted by a number of excursus which take up points already touched upon in the Essay. Especially stimulating is the analysis of the type and the mythology of 'Dispater,' a full list of whose images is given in the alphabetical order of departments. The mallet or hammer, which is the most con- stant attribute of this god, Reinach explains on the supposition that 'en gendral les at- trilruts des dieux sont des fltiches d cchus"': hence that the dieu au maillet was originally a dieu maillet, a mallet-god, on the analogy for instance of the axe-Dionysos at Pagasai. We wonder however that M. Reinach does not apply this illuminating theory to the Jupiter 4 la roue, no. 5. If the god with the hammer was the anthropomorphic de- velopment of the hammer-god, why should not the god with the wheel represent an original wheel-god? Certainly of the two explanations of the wheel by Gaidoz and Flouest respectively, quoted by M. Reinach, that of Flouest, who sees in the wheel a symbol of the thunder, comes nearest to the truth. This later symbolism gives the clue to the original meaning of the wheel; its rumblings closely imitate those of the thunder; hence it is a popular rain-charm 1 and a potent instrument of sympathetic magic. It may be further conjectured that the nine S-shaped objects which the Jupiter carries on a ring slung over his right shoulder were also instrumental in imitating the rattle of the storm. The mallet was doubtless part of the same artillery (cf. however Rhys, loc. cit. p. 67). At every turn of the catalogue interesting points connected with cult and symbolism suggest themselves: thus the numerous votive horses, no. 296 sqq., recall our own ' white horse' in Berkshire, commemorative in popular tradition of a battle between Alfred and the Danes. But the student of art, and of Greek art, will also find the catalogue full of valuable material. I need 1 Cf. J. G. Frazer, Colden Bough, vol. i. p. 21. Mr. Frazer's explanation of the chariot of Krannon, and his remarks on rain charms in general had escaped my memory, both when I wrote the note C.R. 1894, p. 175, and when I was preparing the English ed. of Furtwangler's book (cf. Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture, pp. 469 sqq.).</page><page sequence="3">138 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. only call attention inter alia to the charming Hermaphrodite, no. 118, reminiscent of the Kallipygos, as the author points out, and still more of the graceful Satyr looking back at his tail (Vatican, Helbig 371); to the Satyr &amp;-TrorKo7rCiwv, no. 113, a bronze of capital importance for the history of art, forit is doubtless an echo of the Satyr of Anti- philos; to the lovely Hypnos, no. 102, after a celebrated Greek original. A fine bust, no. 213, M. Reinach well assigns to the group of Polykleitan heads represented by the Doryphoros of Apollonios in Naples. Most superb of all however is a head with turret crown, no. 91, described as Genie de Ville ou Cybele (Cab. des M6dailles). Caylus was most certainly right in refusing to see in this head a Gaulish work; he suggested that it might have been brought from Rome to Paris; its ultimate provenance seems to me more likely to be Greece. It can at any rate have nothing to do with the Renascence; I should suggest that it was copied from a fine Greek original; the fea- tures have the breadth and the seriousness of the fifth century, while the coiffure appears with slight variations on a number of Greek heads of that epoch (with single band, Berlin Skulpt. 608, and J.H.S. ix. pl. IV., with double band, Rbm. Mitth. Taf. vii. p. 165, fig. 1, etc.). As to the mural crown, which represents a mediaeval castle, the lack of organic connexion between it and the head shows it to be a late barbarous addition (cf. the ring on the head of the fine centaur from Spires, no. 117). A charming section is formed by the vases decorated with reliefs (nos. 394- 434), representing scenes for the greater part homelike or idyllic which so clearly attest Alexandrine influence. No. 414 should be especially noted as affording one of the instances, so rare in classical art, of Orpheus playing to the animals. We must perforce admit with M. Reinach that an ' admiration de commande' for Gaulish works would be quite out of place. Yet, clumsy and unintelligent though the Gauls were as artists or handicraftsmen, it must be owned that they showed themselves appreciative of good work by importing such beautiful objects as the Blacas warrior or the turreted head mentioned above, and by not unfrequently choosing good models to copy or to adapt. The result is that the classical archaeologist can no longer afford to neglect Gaulish art. When he does turn to it he will find no more stimulating or suggestive introduction to the whole sub- ject than M. Reinach's admirable De- scOription Raisonne of the Gaulish figured bronzes.
