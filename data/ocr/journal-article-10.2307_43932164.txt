<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PARADIGM OF GREEK RELIGION HERMES ARKADIOS AND OLYMPIOS By Gertrude C. Drake Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville Tn 1854 J. J. Bachofen, the Swiss in- * terpreter of Roman law and religious symbolism, wrote: "There are two roads to knowledge -the longer, slower, more arduous road of, rational combination and the shorter path of the imagination, traversed with the force and swiftness of electricity. Aroused by direct contact with the ancient remains, the imagination grasps the truth at one stroke, without intermediary links." Lacking the results of modern .anthropological and archaeological research, Bachofen had heretically but accurately concluded that underlying the Indo-European, patriarchal, Olympian pantheon of Greek and Roman mythology there must have been another religion, one that belonged to the Near Eastern and Mediterranean agrarian peoples who revered not Zeus but the Great Mother and her divine husband-son, the eternally dying and resurrected god. This phase of matrilinear religio-societal development Bachofen christened Mutterrecht , the Law of the Mother. Scholars as classically competent as he but without his seer's insight into the religious tremenda underlying the peculiarities of the historical evidence were aghast. Conrad Bursian, one of the noted classicists of the era, dubbed Bachofen's exegesis as "feverish fancy and higher nonsense." Only the students of the budding science of anthropology recognized Bachofen as a pioneer in the interpretation of classical myths. In 1890 Sir James Frazer, a highly respected classicist, published his monumental study of comparative mythology and folk practices, The Golden Bough , the outgrowth of his bafflement at that peculiar episode in the Aeneid in which Aeneas breaks off the golden bough to gain entrance to the underworld. He maintained that this</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK Page 115 episode could be traced to the legend of the King of the Grove, the Rex Nemorensis : only by breaking off a bough of Diana's sacred tree and then ritually murdering the incumbent could a mán attain this kingship, to become the priest and consort of the goddess herself. His theory has since been largely repudiated, but his probing into strange tellurian rites encouraged others to study them. Around the turn of the century Sir Arthur Evans' archaeological finds on Crete, A. B. Cook's studies on Zeus, and Jane Harrison's Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion confirmed that mother goddesses had indeed been worshiped by the Pelasgians, the indigenous people of Greece, prior to the arrival there, some time before 1600 B. C., of the Indo-European, patriarchal Achaeans. Later, archaeologists turned up multitudes of votary statuettes of heavy-breasted wide-hipped mothers, so that even the philologist had to bow to the theory of an earlier religion in Greece that had worshiped the principle of fertility, the eternal cycle of birth and death and rebirth. Archaeology has since then yielded much more evidence of this mystical adoration that reconciles the opposites of womb and tomb, of male and female, of night and light, of timelessness and time, of the new year and the old - all transcendentally one. Diffused over a wide area of the Near East and the Mediterranean, the symbols which once evoked religious awe and now provide insight into this divine cycle are remarkably uniform. There is the tree of life and death, which alternately bears fruit and is barren; it may be represented as merely a pillar, the axis mundi. Then there is the waxing and waning moon, the symbol of woman who brings to birth and mourns the dead, as well as the early guide of when to sow and when to reap. Luna's eerie light in darkness mystically disappears; she enfolds in her womb of night the new crescent-to-be, whose horns are like a cow's. Hence another symbol of fertility is the bull, the goddess' virile lover and son. During the great Minoan period (after 1800 B. C.) the offspring of the chief priestess and her consort Minos - the word is perhaps a title of kingship rather than a personal name - was the Minotaur. The bull of Minos may have worn a bull mask during the ritual of the sacred marriage. Poseidon, who, like Dionysus, was called the bull from the sea, was the special god of Crete. His name means "Husband of Earth," and is perhaps the Greek translation of a Cretan name now lost. He is the principle of moisture furrowing through Mother Earth's inlets and valleys. As the Earthshaker he moves her orgiastically. Another symbol that the pre-Greeks used was the pig, which reproduces prolifically. Swine were sacrificed during the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, which honored Demeter and her daughter, Kore-Persephone. The latter matured as the grain maiden, only to be ruthlessly cut down at the harvest. Demeter's holy seed, stored in Mother Earth's womb, was symbolized by the pomegranate seeds which Persephone ate in the underworld after her abduction by Pluto (Earth-Wealth) or Hades. Their marriage again produced the young shoots of grain, and the mourning Demeter rejoiced that from death had come life, her own cereal life. This holy resurrection from death became in classical times one of the deep mystical experiences of the Greeks, even though it was a survival from pre-Olympian times. Also a prominent symbol of this earlier religion, which exalted the eternal unity of opposites in time, was the snake, possibly because the annual renewal of the snake's skin signified the death of the old from which comes the new. Athena, who was perhaps originally a Cretan snake goddess of fertility, is often shown in classical times with a snake beside her, and she wears the aigis , on which was depicted a Medusa head of tangled snakes, possibly an apotropaic gorgon mask worn by the chief priestess of Athena to ward off evil. Later the patriarchal Greeks transformed the goddess into a virgin divinity of the Olympian pantheon. (It should be noted in passing that to a Pelasgian the notion of virginity would have been sacrilegious perversion of the laws of nature. The myth of Hera or Aphrodite renewing her virginity every year is clearly a way of stating this theology: fertility is holy and the earth goddess becomes a maiden annually, is married anew to Pluto, and brings to birth the pristine New Year of bounty after the Old Year has died and been received back in her tellurian embrace.) Such then was the matriarchal religion and the matrilinear society that the aggressive, patriarchal, horse-riding Achaeans encountered when they swarmed down into Greece c. 1800 B. C. They must have been astonished at the importance which women enjoyed there, and the docile subordination of male individuation to the group must have offended their sense of the heroic, of the achievement of aretē - personal honor and manly prowess - by conquest and cattle raiding. They had brought with them their sky god Zeus, the pater familias of their patriarchal society, the father of gods and men. What were they to do about the Pelasgian religion? Over the years these rude barbarians, the molders of the Mycenaean civilization (c. 1600-1 100 B. C.), absorbed much of the elegant Minoan culture, which had spread to Greece from Crete, but they also transformed local daimones and mother goddesses into sky divinities. The old chthonic powers went underground, to emerge as mere epithets for some Olympian. Thus the household snake husband, the agathos daimdn , of the tellurian snake goddess, the Agatha Tyche , emerged as an epithet of Zeus; he became Zeus Ktesios, protector of the larder or the household. Hermes is another Pelasgian power whose epithets often hint at his primitive functions; e. g., as Hermes Nomios, the shepherd god, he reveals his origin as a good-luck genie that brought increase to flocks. The process of Hermes' transformation by the Mycenaean Greeks from a tellurian power of the Pelasgians into a glorious Olympian can clearly be traced by noting the common elements in his myths which disclose his earlier and his later functions. According to the Homeric Hymn to Hermes , the god was born in a cave on Mount Cyllene high above the lonely, lovely, pastoral vales of Arcadia, in the Peloponnese. His father was Zeus, his mother Maia, the eldest of the Pleiades, or rain nymphs, daughters of Atlas the Titan. Maia's name means "nurse," or even "midwife." Like Dionysus' nurses, the Hyades, who were also nymphs of moisture, or the goat goddess Amalthea, the nurse of Cretan Zeus, Maia was the nourisher of the young. The myth reveals that in the older, matriarchal religion Hermes was the divine child of an Arcadian mother goddess, and was himself a god of fertility, of male moisture. The connection with wetness threads through several other myths. Cécrops, king of Athens, who was half man and half snake, had three daughters: Aglauros, a well nymph; Herse, the dew; and Pandrosos, who I believe was the mist. Now Hermes fell in love with Herse, and bribed Aglauros to arrange a rendezvous for him. Aglauros accepted the bribe but because of her jealousy of Herse did nothing to forward the affair. In a rage the god turned her into a stone and ravished Herse, who bore him two sons: Cephalus, who was beloved by the Dawn and who used to call on the cloud Nephele for rain, and Ceryx, the first herald of the Eleusinian mysteries. (The Hersephoria festival at Athens was celebrated on Midsummer's Night by maidens who collected dew under the full moon, as was done in England up until this century.) On another occasion Hermes sent a Golden Ram to rescue Phrixus, son of the cloud Nephele. Another myth is that he fathered Pan by Dryope, a woodpecker nymph; in folklore woodpeckers are widely thought to be predictors of rain. Again, the mother of another of Hermes' sonsj Autolycus, the master thief, was Chione,</page><page sequence="3">Page 116 THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK the snow nymph, and Daphnis, whom Hermes also fathered, was associated with a fountain in Sicily. The Homeric hymn and other sources also represent Hermes as the merry trickster of folklore, the younger son who outwits his older brother. This aspect of the god may simply be an elaboration of his original religious significance as a magician, as will be explained later. As soon as he is born the god quickly grows into a boy who steals Apollo's cattle by obliterating their tracks. Later, however, some satyrs spot him outside the nymph Cyllene's cave playing on the lyre he has made from a tortoise shell and the guts of some of the stolen cows. Apollo arrives, picks his divine brother up, and carries him to Olympus to be judged by Zeus, who commands Hermes to restore the cattle, to respect divine property henceforth, and to tell no more lies. All this Hermes promises to do, but qualifies his promise by saying that while he will never tell lies he is not under obligation to tell the whole truth either. Zeus, who is amused by the young scoundrel's ingenuity and gall in announcing himself as the twelfth Olympian, makes him his herald in charge of treaties, commerce, and the protection of travelers. He then gives him the caduceus, a herald's staff with fluttering ribbons; a pet asos , or broad-brimmed traveler's hat; and winged sandals. From Apollo he receives his rhabdos , or magic wand, which he uses to lay upon the eyes of the dying, thus summoning them to Hades, or to awaken the spirits of the dead, the keres. The latter function belonged to the older Pelasgian religion, but survived in a festival of classical times, something like the Christian All Souls' Day. Another aspect of Hermes, this time in his role as trickster, was his patronage of a topsy- turvy Cretan festival similar to the Roman Saturnalia. So much for the tapestried patterns of Hermes' mythology, that is, the narrative exegesis of his symbols. When we turn to the functional symbols themselves we are in for a shock. It is true that Hermes had his origin in lovely, pastoral Arcadia, but it was not on a mountain top. He was merely an upright stone pillar, a hermes at the crossroads, as his name indicates. How in the world could a stone, probably originally only roughhewn, ever have acquired the sanctity of a fertility daimon worshiped by the pre-Hellenic Pelasgians, and then have been refashioned into an Olympian who became not only the patron of merchants, thieves, travelers, gymnasts, and gamblers, but also the noble messenger of Zeus and the god of rhetoric and literature? To find the answer - or rather, an answer - the right question must be asked. What did the simple, pious Pelasgian shepherd of Arcadia who first erected a herm, as these uprights are called, feel at a crossroads that revealed to him that he was standing in the presence of the numinous? And why did other passers-by each add a stone, until ultimately there was formed a cairn that covered most of the finger-like herm and was shaped something like the omphalos at Delphi? Why this experience of mystic awe at a crossroads commemorated by stones? i The myth of Deucalion and Pyrrha may contain part of the answer. Because of their piety these two early offspring of the Titans, the elder gods whom Mother Earth had brought forth, were the only mortals to survive the great flood sent by Zeus to punish wicked men. Told to cast their mother's bones behind them in order to repopulate the world, they cast stones, which became men and women. Because Greece is a stony land, farming and pasturing are difficult; even so, the religious shepherd or farmer knew that the Great Mother had yielded from her thin soil whatever bounties he enjoyed. But her stones, too, were a part of her holy being, of her mysterious power. Stones were to be used respectfully, for building huts, walls, altars, and tombs, and for erecting road markers so that the weary traveler would know where he was. At crossroads in particular the mysterious magic of the lonely land would have been felt. The wayfarer would have asked: "How far have I traveled? How far have I to go? Which road should I take? What shall I find at the end of my journey?" The crossroads must have represented to early men all over the world exactly what it means to modern man: the place and time for awful choice, the hope of good fortune or the fear of ill luck at the end of the road. The pillar or cairn must have been the outward symbol of an immanent, male, divine reality on the road of life and death, erected from the bones of Mother Earth, who, fertilized, gives forth and receives back. If the pious man were in tune with this rhythm, he would know that the marker or cairn was the dwelling, the chapel if you will, of an agathos daimon , a good spirit. Now one of Hermes' titles was agathopoios , the good-luck-maker, and in the magical papyri, which contain very primitive material, he is invoked as the male spirit attending on Agatha Tyche , who is none other than Good Fortune, the Bona Dea, Great Mother Nature, whose seasons, the Horae, revolve eternally, turning the joy of harvest into the sorrow of winter, and back again to joy. And so Hermes, who with his wand brings the cloud of death or raises the dead to life, is Earth's divine husband, whose magic moistens her so that she and he can reincarnate the dead. Hermes is Earth's necromancer. Jane Harrison has pretty well proved that Hermes, as an agathos daimon , called up from the wine casks (pithoi ) the keres , the ghosts of the dead, before the new wine was broached. On the second day of the festival seeds from each harvest product were boiled together to form the panspermia , but no one tasted of the pot; instead, the household sacrificed, not to the Olympians, but to Hermes Chthonios, Hermes of the Earth. On the third day the ghosts were bidden to depart, for they had work to do. They had been called up by the Good Genie, Hermes, to take back to the earth the panspermia so that they could live again when all the seeds had grown to a new harvest, celebrated as a pankarpia. Hermes, as Earth's husband-magician, had the function of insuring the reincarnation of the ghosts. To return now to the herms, the stone markers on the roads. In a very real sense the Pelasgian was aware of the fertility function of Hermes as the god of increase and decrease, of waxing and waning, of coming into being and of dying, of profit and loss. The later sophisticated herms were squared posts with Hermes' head at the top; halfway up was an ithyphallic representation, clearly demonstrating that Hermes was the principle of the male, fecundating moisture. At the side of the herm was carved his symbol, the caduceus - but not the magical rhabdos , which was functional. At the end of the caduceus were two intertwined snakes, which became two fluttering white ribbons after he had become an Olympian herald. These male and female snakes represent the Pelasgian religious concept of the ultimate resolution of duality in the timelessness of eternal birth and death. (As a symbol of this non- Olympian notion of the transcendental oneness of man and woman, the man- woman called Hermaphroditus was the son-daughter of Hermes and Aphrodite.) That the sophisticated Athenians, oriented as they were to the patriarchal Olympian worship, yet felt the holiness of this so-called primitive view of life is attested by their shock when, in 41 5 B. C., the herms in the city were mutilated; Alcibíades, who was implicated in the sacrilege, was banished. But the Hellenes, who loved the bright sky and this world, and whose patriarchal religion and society fostered individuation, rationality, and aggressive independence, resisted this cyclic, lunar mysticism for which primitive men had gladly died as blood sacrifices to ensure the fertility of Mother Earth. Her white- and-black magic of bringing to birth and to death chilled the Greeks. Nothing was so horrible to them as the thought of becoming vague shadows forever in their grim underworld. A curious passage in the Odyssey , as Rhys Carpenter has pointed out, shows their inability or</page><page sequence="4">THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK Page 117 unwillingness to understand magic. Hermes is sent down to give Odysseus a magic plant, the moly, which will protect the hero from being turned into a pig by Circe, who has already turned his men into swine. What does Homer have Odysseus do with this mõlyl One reads on with anticipation, but is doomed to disappointment. Odysseus does exactly nothing with it. And it should be noted that Circe, who was probably originally a mother goddess with pigs about her ready to be sacrificed, has been turned into a witch by the patriarchal Greeks. In what other ways did the Indo- European Greeks reshape the Pelasgian functions of Hermes to fit more decorously their sky divinities and their religio-societal requirements? First of all, from a frightening tellurian daimon Hermes was transmogrified into the too solid flesh and ichor of an anthropomorphic Olympian feasting on nectar and ambrosia to keep his divine strength up. He became a bright, rational god. Next, as a roadside herm he became the patron of all who used roads, especially merchants, highwaymen, heralds, and ambassadors from one state to another. He promoted trade because he had been a fertility spirit of Arcadia, where his son Pan pastured flocks of goats and sheep, good legal tender before the days of coinage - as the word "pecuniary" (from pecus) indicates. (The Latin equivalent of Hermes, Mercury, is derived from the same root that gives us "merchant.") Thieves prayed to him for success, not only becaùse of his control of their escape routes but also because, as previously explained, the ex-magician who had helped Mother Earth to make the crops bounteous was turned into the jolly trickster of folklore who succeeds in stealing Apollo's cattle. It will also be remembered that he was the father of Autolycus, the master thief. As for ambassadors and heralds, Hermes became their patron saint because Olympian Zeus had appointed him to be his personal messenger, who, while never lying, did not always tell the whole truth. Even in our own time ambassadors have been noted for their tricky double-talk and the concealment which noble rhetoric provides. Hermes was therefore also the patron of language, rhetoric, and ultimately literature, especially pastoral poetry. Finally, athletes and gamblers sacrificed to him, perhaps because he would bring them good luck in his role of former agathos daimon , the male counterpart of bounteous Good Fortune, Agatha Tyche , for one of his epithets is eriounios , the helper, the luck-bringer. Hermes' connection with moisture as a vegetation spirit fecundating the Earth seems to have vanished when he became an Olympian, but he is at times connected with clouds. In the Aeneid he alights on Atlas, his grandfather's mountain, before flying on to Carthage with Zeus's message to Aeneas to quit dallying with Dido and get on with the mission of founding Rome. The trouble with the passage is that Vergil speaks of Atlas being "ever girt with storm clouds," and it is Zeus who is the storm-cloud gatherer. If anything, Hermes should be a scudding, fleecy white cloud. Such was Ruskin's interpretation of one of Hermes' functions. He pointed out that Hermes' title of Argeiphontes , Argus slayer, may mean that Hermes is a cloud that obscures the stars of night, Argus' multitude of eyes, which Hera placed in her peacock's tail, the night sky, after Hermes had slain Io's guardian. A late author, Statius, speaks of the "cloud- wrapped Arcadian with rod of power." In one of Horace's odes (2.7) the poet recounts how at the battle of Philippi Mercury bore him swiftly through the foe in a thick cloud. But this sort of miracle most of the Olympians seemed able to manage. The Olympian religion retained Hermes' old function of psychopompos , of leading the shades of the dead down below the earth, but the meaning of his function of also reincarnating them was lost or obscured. In three passages Homer speaks of Hermes' magic wand, the rhabdos, "wherewith he lulls to sleep the eyes of whom he will, while others again he awakens even out of slumber." This is a pale memory of the earlier dual aspect of the god's chthonic magic. In Horace Mercury conducts souls down to Hades, but does not bring them back up - the correct Olympian eschatology. From this brief sketch one can see how far Hermes himself had to travel to get from his humble roadside pillar in Arcady to the heights of Olympus. To epitomize the magnitude of this transformation of Arcadian Hermes Chthonios into Hermes Olympios it is appropriate to close by quoting Horace's "Hymn to Mercury" (1.10; tr. C. E. Bennett in the Loeb edition): "O Mercury, grandson eloquent of Atlas, thou that with wise insight didst mould the savage ways of men just made, by giving speech and setting up the grace- bestowing wrestling-ground, thee will I sing, messenger of mighty Jove and of the gods, and father of the curving lyre; clever, too, to hide in sportive stealth whate'er thy fancy chose. Once in thy boyhood, as Apollo strove with threatening words to fright thee, should'st thou not return the kine thy craft had stolen, he laughed to find himself bereft of quiver too. 'Twas by thy guidance also that Priam, laden with rich gifts, when leaving Ilium, escaped the proud Atridae, the Thessalian watchfires, and the camp that menaced Troy. Tis thou dost bring the pious souls to their abodes of bliss, marshalling the shadowy throng with golden wand, welcome alike to gods above and those below."</page></plain_text>
