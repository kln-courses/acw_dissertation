<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Journal of English Literary History VOLUME EIGHT MARCH, 1941 NUMBER ONE THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: A SELECTIVE AND CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR THE YEAR 1940 WALTER GRAHAM, Editor This bibliography as a whole is designed to cover a " move- ment " rather than a period. While it is generally limited to the years 1800-1837, as far as the English items are concerned, it is not so limited, of course, in the items regarding other literatures. Important books published earlier are included in the list for 1940 when for some reason they were inadequately noticed in the bibliography for 1939 (ELH 7.1-38) or when significant reviews have appeared within the year 1940. In all cases where no date for the year is given, 1940 may be assumed. The editor acknowledges with gratitude the assistance of his several collaborators: for materials gathered, Walter G. John- son (English and Scandinavian items) , Andre Leveque (French), Robert T. Ittner (German), Felix Giovanelli (Italian), and Eduardo Neale-Silva (Spanish); and for comments, Charles F. Harrold, Alice D. Snyder, Newman I. White, Paul Landis, Clarence D. Thorpe, A. D. McKillop, Edwin H. Zeydel, David Lee Clark, and Horace A.

Pp. 11 + 582. Chapter 13 of this valuable book is entitled " Romantic Ideas and Social Programs in England and America." Here for the first time in a history of aesthetics English romanticism receives something like due attention. Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley are treated as representative of the period, and Keats is included " as foil to the main line of romantic esthetes." One regrets to find the term " esthetes " applied, even by implication, to Wordsworth and Coleridge. Unfortunately (in view of his unique services to English aesthetics) Hazlitt, along with Leigh Hunt and De Quincey, is omitted. (C. D. T.) Grierson, Sir Herbert. Essays and addresses. London.

Bald; Some Early Nineteenth-century Letters, hitherto unpublished, edited by Leslie N. Broughton; Byron and the East: literary sources of the " Turkish Tales," by Harold S. L. Wiener. Professor Bald (pp. 1-45) supplements Professor Lowes' study of the Gutch memorandum book by material from the fifty other notebooks that have survived. The contents of these add to previous knowledge of Col- eridge's mind in that they elucidate a number of passages in the " Ancient Mariner," especially those which were altered or added afterl 1800. More- over, they illustrate the workings of Coleridge's mind sufficiently to suggest some modifications of Lowes' conclusions. Professor Broughton (pp. 47-88) prints a score of hitherto unpublished letters by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, and others-letters preserved in the Wordsworth collection at Cornell University, and of sufficient importance to be of interest to specialists in the period. Professor Wiener (pp. 89-129) finds that Byron's great success with his "Turkish Tales " was due to the fact that he wrote of countries and customs which were familiar to him. His use of travel books, though frequently of importance, was at best secondary and subordinate to his personal experience. (W. G.) Romanticism: a symposium. By John C.

Furthermore, the several authoritative statements and the selective bibli- ography attached will be useful to the general reader and to scholars un- familiar with the special manifestations of romanticism in some of the countries included. But the difficulties inherent in the undertaking come to light in Miss Nitchie's valiant attempt to bring the various studies into some sort of focus. On the whole the symposium stands as a courageous if not entirely successful venture in the field of comparative criticism. It should be read with the editorial statement of hopes and fears kept clearly in mind. (A. D. S.) Rudman, Harry W. Italian nationalism and English letters. Lon- don. Allen &amp; Unwin.

New York. Columbia Unliversity Press. Pp. 314. Only two chapters of this book are devoted to odes composed between the work of Gray and that of the Victorian poets; an early chapter deals with " The Ode Prior to Milton," the " Conclusion " traces its history down to the present. Many readers will regret that considerations of space and proportion limit the author's discussion of some of the greatest of the odes, especially those of the Romantics: Coleridge receives only four pages, Wordsworth seven, Shelley four, Keats nine. Not all of the author's judg- ments will go unchallenged; his manner is at times a bit too breezy, as when he says that "the major poets of the Romantic time seldom were innovators in the sense that they devised new verse patterns " (p. 243), or that " 'The Prisoner of Chillon ' . . . is undoubtedly a Pindaric, mated to a narrative purpose . . ." (p. 257). Much more might have been done with Wordsworth's "Immortality Ode" than is done on pp. 250-251; and cer- tainly the " Ode to Duty " deserves more than half a page (p. 252). The pages on Keats' odes are singularly inadequate in view of our present knowledge of Keats' evolution as a poet. However, these criticisms must be understood as applying to a work which covers three hundred years, and which does give a clear and connected picture of the fortunes of the ode from Tudor times down to a mention of Allen Tate's " Ode to the Con- federate Dead " in a footnote on the last page. Originally designed as a doctoral dissertation, it is more concerned with the history of form than with analysis. The author, formerly connected with the Commonweal, now president of Hunter College, studies the direct and indirect derivation of the English ode from the Pindaric models, and also its debt to the author of the Psalms. His hope of showing the ode as linking poetry and music is only fragmentarily fulfilled and perhaps might better have been left outside of the present volume. On the whole, President Schuster's work is a useful continuation of the work done in Shafer's The English Ode to 1660, Princeton, 1918. (C. F.

The critical introduction of nearly a hundred pages helps toward the understanding of Coleridge's temperament and his literary power-its achieve- ments and its short-comings as well. Relationships suggested between his talk and his written prose, and even his poetry, are well worth consideration. The book proper, a compilation of seventy-odd descriptions of Coleridge's talk written by his contemporaries, makes easily available a body of material much of which would escape the ordinary Coleridge student. The bio- graphical notes attached to the quotations show good judgment in selection of pertinent facts. The index enables the reader to turn readily to the various comments on some special aspect of Coleridge's conversation. Full notes afford adequate bibliographical references and supplementary descrip- tive material. (A4 D. S.) Bald, R. C. (See above, Section 3). Bewley, Eugene M., and Leavis, F. R. Revaluations (XII and XIII): the poetry of Coleridge. Scrutiny 8 (1940). 406-20. Coleridge in criticism. Scrutiny 9 (1940). 57-69. In a detailed analysis of " The Ancient Mariner," " Kubla Khan," and "Dejection: an Ode," Eugene Bewley reaches the conclusion that the last- named is Coleridge's most important poem. The proposition most likely to provoke fruitful discussion is that the texture of " The Ancient Mariner " is uninteresting because inflexible, "manufactured to compass a certain pre- conceived effect, and one that . . . is scarcely closed to suspicion." Reconsidering Coleridge's work in criticism, F. R. Leavis grants his qualifications for a great achievement and his historical importance, but finds his " currency as an academic classic " to be " something of a scandal." Leavis's contribution to the familiar controversy is in line with the philosophy and methods of criticism known to his readers in Scrutiny and elsewhere, and will be judged accordingly. (A. D. S.)

Sister Eugenia and her editorial assistants, and those who made the publication of this concordance financially possible, are to be congratulated on seeing through an arduous piece of scholarly work that will aid im- measurably the intelligent reading of Coleridge's poetry. The general plan of the book is that of Lane Cooper's Wordsworth con- cordance, now accepted as the most adequate scheme for such a work. Ernest Hartley Coleridge's two-volume edition of the Poetical Works, Ox- ford, 1912, is rightly used as the basic text. In its policy of inclusions, exclusions, and partial recordings, the concordance is if anything over- generalized: personal and possessive pronouns in the first person are, as Cooper noted, of considerable importance in the writings of a subjective poet, but I am not sure that this importance carries over into their use in Coleridge's dramas and dramatic translations; there is no question, however, as to the importance of the many references to variant readings, and over- generosity is not a serious fault.

In a fresh exploration of Keats's aesthetic ideas, Mr. Bate has attempted the difficult feat of bringing varied and apparently diverse elements of theory under the single unifying principle of Negative Capability. The basic concept in the system he thus presents is intuition (Keats's word is " sen- sation "): where reason constructs its own world, often according to pre- determined conceptions, poetic intuition enters into life, sees it as it is; in all its force and hidden meaning, and accepts it without bias in under- standing and sympathy. In its larger aspects the principle of Negative Capability embraces implicit trust in the imagination, objective detachment, passiveness, self-annihilation, and sympathetic identification; more specifically, it implies an acceptance of and devotion to the particular and to the force and intensity which are embedded in the particular, whatever its imperfections, however inadequately it is known to the intellect. Such a philosophy is empirical; in it the concrete and the ideal are the same thing; it sees man as he is: as a " poor forked creature," but also as a being with an " electric fire " within, a hidden intention and movement which constitute his real identity, the Beauty and the Truth of his being. It is the peculiar function of the poet of Negative Capability to catch this inner life and to portray it in language of concentrated intensity. This was a function which Keats himself exemplified to a remarkable degree. Mr. Bate's results in general justify his approach. He has read his author well and his interpretations carry the authority of adroitly selected evidence. There remain, it is true, certain difficulties for the reader: some of the terms would bear closer definition-ideat, for example-and some stubborn problems of " unreconciled opposites " are not resolved. It may be remarked, too, that the parallel with Bergson in the early part of the essay is, in view of the complexity and sophistication of that author's theory of in- tuition, somewhat dubious. Such flaws do not, however, subtract appreciably from the merits of Mr. Bate's performance. (C. D. T.) Burke, Charles Bell. Keats and Spenser again. PQ 19 (1940). 149-50. Chowdhuri, Bhawani Sankar.

University of California Publications in English. Ber- keley, University of California Press. Pp. 131-151. This study is, if anything, more about Hazlittl than about Keats, for it has for its main purpose to explain Keats's meaning in his famed equation of beauty and truth in terms of certain aspects of Hazlitt's aesthetic. Keats, Mr. Caldwell rightly points out, knew Hazlitt's theory well and seems to have adapted parts of it to his own ends. The pertinent elements here have to do with perception and the associative process and with con- trast and intensity. Specifically, with reference to Keats's meaning in the last lines of his Ode, Hazlitt thought that in aesthetic experience our apprehension of beauty consists in a perception of a rich web of associated</page><page sequence="15">ENGLISH: STUDIES OF AUTHORS 15 ideas, and, further, that the intensity produced by contrast, especially in meditation, is likely to be related to a recognition of beauty and truth. There are details in Professor Caldwell's exposition which admit of difference of opinion: for example, his analysis of the Ode on a Grecian Urn and of the related odes. He is also probably inclined to lay greater stress on contrast in Hazlitt than the facts quite warrant; Hazlitt also emphasized the principle of similarity. In the main lines of his thesis, however, he is undoubtedly on firm ground. There can be little question that Hazlitt's thinking on aesthetic matters had laid a firm hold on Keats; Hazlitt himself had identified truth with beauty, and on grounds which Keats might well have accepted.

It was inevitable that sooner or later someone should write a book on Keats's sonnets, for Keats was one of the most important sonneteers of the nineteenth century. Saintsbury says of Keats that it was he who, more than anyone else of the Romantic period, caught up and consolidated the gains of the " new school " and passed them on to his successors as a part of the main stream of British poetry. Keats's contribution in the special field of the sonnet was in this respect no exception: he was able to achieve a synthesis of the newer elements with the traditional; and, in spite of some tendencies toward radical experimentation, he left behind him a body of sonnet literature generally true to the Petrarchan and Shakespearian models (Mr. Zillman classes forty-five of his sixty-seven sonnets as Petrarchan, six- teen as Shakespearian), but exemplifying also the extension in range of subjects and the greater flexibility in melody, metre, phrasing, and so forth, that had characterized the development of the English quatorzain in the</page><page sequence="16">16 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY hands of Wordsworth (under the influence of Milton) and Leigh Hunt. It is of incidental interest that the two main established patterns of the English sonnet are what have lived, whereas such variants as the Spenserian and the Wordsworthian have tended to fall into disuse., All of these generali- zations are either explicitly drawn by Mr. Zillman, or are implicit in his findings. Mr. Zillman's study will have most appeal to those who are interested in the sonnet as a form and in specific[ problems of versecraft. The book is divided into two parts and is furnished with appendices containing all the sonnets of Keats and broad summaries of the practice of our leading sonneteers. Most readers will find the general discussion in Part I, entitled " The Sonnet and its Status in the Age of Keats," more satisfactory than the " objective and comparative " analyses of Part II, with its several tables showing how Keats stood beside his fellows in matters of technique; but both contain useful information and valuable suggestions. The comparison of the poetic theories of Hunt and Keats in application to the sonnet and the discussion of Wordsworth's practice are especially instructive, though the influence of Hunt on Keats is perhaps overrated. It is one of the anomalies of the technical approach to poetry that the conclusions are sometimes at variance with those arrived at through other methods. Thus Mr. Zillman finds that in Keats's sonnets written after March 1, 1817, there is, in comparison with his earlier ones, " a richer blend of variety within uniformity, and a more skilful adaptation of content to form "; yet most critics would agree, no doubt, that Keats wrote more sonnets of memorable literary quality before this date than after it-my own count is eight to seven. This, however, is not to deny values to the technical approach. At a time when there is so little attention to this kind of study, we should rather welcome additions to the field, such as Mr. Ziliman's, for the possibilities they afford of extending and sharpening our perceptions of critical problems.

Scott is an epic rather than a romantic writer, and his most significant similes and metaphors are heroic or Homeric. Such is the thesis of this painstaking book, illustrated by elaborate citation and detailed analysis of Scott's figures of speech. It is an attempt to make more precise our sense of the amplitude and profundity of Scott's best work; but whether this can best be done by making an absolute distinction between epic and romance and equating Scott with the epic poets is more than doubtful. What is gained by taking four pages to show that Rashleigh Osbaldistone is a " Scotch Antinous," or by saying that the Scotch would have sympathized with the Geats in Beowulf, if they had ever heard of them? It seems a pity to spend so much time pointing out " subconscious analogues " with Homer when Scott's richly complex art calls for exploration in many directions. (A. D. McK.) Grierson, Sir Herbert.

Pp. 748; 642 + index. Rev. by Frances Winwar in NYT Dec. 8, pp. 1, 37; by Richard Aldington in SRL Dec. 7, p. 7; by Margaret Armstrong in NYHTB Nov. 24, p. 3. Professor White's Shelley, with its fifteen hundred pages of text and notes, is a veritable monument of scholarship. To the general reader its very bulk is forbidding, but to the Shelley specialist it is a long-expected and welcome addition to the Shelley library. Few English authors have been the subject of more biographical studies than Percy Bysshe Shelley. They are roughly divided into early and late; of the first, the outstanding are by those who personally knew the poet in varying degrees. Thomas Medwin in 1847, Thomas Jefferson Hogg, Thomas Love Peacock, and Edward Trelawney in 1858 published their sketches of Shelley. The first had known the poet a few years in the early life and the last few months of his life; Hogg for seven years, Peacock for about three, and Trelawney, for only the last six months. Since these " eye-witness " biographers wrote from a memory of from thirty to sixty years, since their opinion had undergone considerable change, since Medwin and Hogg are known unscrupulously to have tampered with the original materials-for their own purposes-since Peacock and Trelawney knew how to polish a simple story, since pronouncements of the four are the source of nearly all the facts as well as the errors concerning the poet's personal life, a major problem for later biographers has been the discriminating examination of these sources. This is one of the acid tests of the worth of their studies. Edward Dowden, the authorized biographer, working from a mass of private letters and papers, and correcting the above sources in many respects, gave to the world in 1886 the first essentially honest portrait of the poet. Despite the besmirching of Harriet's and the occasional whitewashing of Shelley's character, Dowden's biography remains the most sympathetic and vivid account of Shelley's life that has yet appeared. In 1917 the late Roger Ingpen, drawing upon a mass of new facts and letters from the recently discovered Shelley-Whitton papers, published his Shelley in England. For the years covered (1792-1818), this work has not been surpassed. In 1927 Professor Walter E. Peck, working from much new material and drawing upon a large number of scholarly books and articles, published what promised to be a definitive life of the poet; but he found some of the material used by Dowden no longer accessible; and he failed to use fully the sources available to him. Clearly the need for a new biography was indicated-one which would sympathetically interpret the poet's life, correct the persistent errors of the " eye-witness " biographers, properly curb Dowden's enthusiasm, one which would adequately assimilate the mass of new facts which have come to light since Ingpen and Peck wrote. For the most part, Professor White's Shelley does all this. His style is dignified; his material inclusive and well proportioned; his scholarship ample and penetrating; and his attitude toward Shelley understanding and sympathetic. His biography will, therefore, aid materially in destroying the Victorian conception of the poet as a beautiful and ineffectual angel. Professor White is fortunate in being able to draw upon material either before unavailable or unknown, such as the complete journals of Shelley and Mary, and of Jane Clairmont; the diary of Harriet Grove; Professor Gordon's Shelley-Hogg Letters; many other newly discovered letters; and many private</page><page sequence="20">920 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY papers. This fact alone enables Professor White to give a fuller and more accurate picture of the poet's life and a more discriminating interpretation of his writings than had previously appeared. His explanation, for example, of the significance of the Madman in Julian and Maddalo is the most plausible yet advanced. His logical and sympathetic mind gets at the only sensible explanation for the estrangement of Shelley and Mary during the fateful winter of 1818-19. The unravelling of the meaning of that very difficult poem, Epipsychidion, will be welcomed by the Shelley enthusiast, who will find no twisting of the facts and none of the scandal that has so delighted some biographers. The White biography gives the fullest account of how Shelley appeared to his contemporaries (Shelley was not neglected by the general public or by the reviewers who feared his powerful pen); in this, the biography corrects false impressions and many of Mary's erroneous statements. The poet's relation with Jane Williams is here for the first time sensibly explained as normal and wholesome correcting the sentimental Vic- torians and the scandal-mongers. But the newest and most sensational fact in this biography is the positive proof that Shelley's Neapolitan ward actually existed. Professor White found in Naples the birth and baptismal records of Elena Adelaide-Shelley (her parentage yet remains a profound mystery), and the Hoppner-Foggi scandal, while yet unexplained, is nearer solution. Shelley's statement before a magistrate that she was his and Mary's child cannot be taken at its face value, for Mary appears to have known nothing about her. Professor White suggests that she was the daughter of (1) Shelley and Claire Clairmont; or (2) Shelley and an unknown mother; or (3) Claire and an unknown father; or (4) parents both of whom are unknown. Each possibility is weighed and the evidence sifted thoroughly to the conclusion that Elena Adelaide was the daughter of unknown parents, adopted by Shelley, perhaps without Mary's knowledge. This is the only conclusion which a fair-minded scholar conversant with the whole course of the poet's life could possibly draw. Professor White has elected to put his notes at the end of each volume, an awkward arrangement, at best. It leads him to relate in the body of the text, without qualification, as if they were true, stories, episodes, and incidents from the unscrupulous Medwin and Hogg, and the none too reliable Peacock and Trelawney. To be sure, Professor White does qualify, explain away, or deny their truth, in notes tucked away at the back of the book, but their validity still stands in the text. A result is that no recent Shelley biographer, not even Professor Peck, appears to put so much reliance on these "eye- witnesses," particularly Hogg, as does Professor White. Instead of dismissing it summarily, the biographer argues the question of Shelley's possible insanity. Certainly, the case for it is pitifully weak; for, by the tests applied, almost every genius the world has known would be judged queer or insane. It must ever be held in mind that most of the stories about the poet's "queerness " come from "eye-witnesses " after an interval of thirty to sixty years, and often with an apparent intention of making Shelley appear insane. It is also to be regretted that Professor White repeatedly refers to Shelley as an atheist; the poet makes it unmis- takably clear, wherever the subject of God arises in his letters, essays, and poetry, that he is an atheist only in the sense that he denies the existence of a creative, anthropomorphic God. To have any other impression is to misunderstand Shelley. These strictures are largely matters of opinion and cannot seriously</page><page sequence="21">ENGLISH: STUDIES OF AUTHORS 21 weaken the main thesis of the book and the final estimate of the poet's life. Professor White's Shelley is a monument of scholarship and insight, and is destined to be the authoritative and definitive life of the poet for years to come. It is easily the book of the year in this field of literary scholarship. (D. L. C.) . The unextinguished hearth. Durham, N. C., 1938. Duke University Press. Rev. by P. L.

An answer to the criticism that Romanticism is alien to the French spirit, an apostasy from Classicism due to the baleful influence of the literatures of England and Germany. Professor Havens calls this an emotional reaction, not a sound historical view, and proceeds to trace the course of French Romanticism briefly to the moment of its triumph, showing that if it was in some respects a return to admiration of the Middle Ages, it was also a natural continuation of the freedom and exuberance of the Renaissance. The individualism of the Renaissance reappears in the French Romantic Movement, yet classic order and logic persist also. Classicism against which Romanticism was definitely a reaction still continued to exert a potent influence in France, yet Romanticism established the right of a new literature to come into being.

This is part of the sixty-page symposium (see Romanticism: Section 3 above), the outgrowth of work accomplished in the Group General Topics II of the Modern Language Association Meetings. The results prove that the MLA groups, which have often been criticized, can really make valuable contributions in the spirit of cooperative scholarship. We are directly con- cerned here only with Professor Blankenagel's expos6 of German romanticism. As he points out, any attempt to give a brief and generalizing account of so complex a phenomenon is beset with pitfalls. Nevertheless he succeeds very well in outlining the salient features of the movement. Perhaps his sum- mary may be supplemented by the following words translated from the chapter on Romanticism which Gustav Pauli wrote for Dehio's Geschichte der deutschen Kunst, volume 4: " Das 19. Jahrhundert " (1934): " Romanti- cism is Germanic and attained its purest expression in those regions which were least touched by Roman colonization. Whatever is considered an essential aspect of the romantic spirit-individualism, irrationalism, the mystic fusion of subject and object, the tendency to mingle the arts, the yearning for the distant and the exotic, the feeling for the infinite and the organity of historical development-these are all characteristic of German romanticism, so much so that their union is incomprehensible to Latins. What is called romanticism in France has only the name in common with German romanticism." To the teacher of romanticism, whether depart- mentalized or not, this symposium, which may be procured as a separate offprint, should prove a godsend. (E. H. Z.) Gass, K. E.

While the author shows he has been extremely conscientious (using over 900 quotations) in his efforts to study thoroughly all aspects of the appeal of Nature to the writers of the period, he fails in any enlightening penetra- tion into his material. The conclusions he draws scarcely warrant his expenditure of energy, especially since his sole criticism of previous studies, dealing directly or incidentally with the subject, is that they are " general."

Professor Long of Williams College is to be congratulated upon this interesting and valuable study of an early American figure who was of great importance in shaping the intellectual ties which existed between the United States and Germany a hundred or more years ago. One of that sturdy group of New England Unitarians who were attracted by the liberalism of German thought and letters, Hedge was sent to study in Germany at the tender age of twelve, where he remained for four significant years. Although he returned to Germany later in life, it cannot be doubted that his first long stay was the decisive one for him. To be sure, his interest in German literature did not stop with romanticism (his principal occu- pation was naturally with Goethe), but his famous Prose Writers of Ger- many and Hours with German Classics, together with numerous articles and reviews written in the course of a very long life, show that he possessed a deeper understanding of such writers as Tieck, Novalis and Chamisso than any other American of his day and that what knowledge of these authors seeped through to America was due largely to him. No study of the part played by the German literature of 1780-1830 in the intellectual life of the United States could be complete without reference to Frederic Henry Hedge. The booklet of Professor Long has done much to facilitate such study. (Es H. Z.) Schmitz, Matthias. Caspar David Friedrich. His Life and Work. New York. German Library of Information. Pp. 55. 22 illustrations (some in colors). This beautifully illustrated book, from the pen of Dr. Matthias Schmitz, consists of a scholarly discussion of the life and work of the romantic painter Friedrich (born in Greifswald in Pomerania in 1774, died in Dresden in</page><page sequence="27">GERMAN: STUDIES OF AUTHORS 27 1840), and a presentation, in full page photographs, some of them in colors, of his principal paintings. Friedrich, with Runge and Carus, is a typical creative artist of romantic trends, whose work illustrates German romanti- cism quite as accurately and much more visually than do the writings of the literary men. It was Friedrich who introduced mood and atmosphere into landscape and who endowed his landscapes with a solemn, melancholy character, to reflect the similarly attuned mood of the romantic artist who is part and parcel of them. Just as the romantic tales of Tieck, for instance, establish a consonance between nature and the soul of man, so that the temper of one finds its (ofttimes bizarre) reflection in the other, so the paintings of Friedrich are designed and executed in the identical spirit. The attractive work reveals once more how intimately stylus and brush worked together to achieve the same purpose in the Age of the Blue Flower. (E. H. Z.) Schultz, Franz.

This Zurich doctoral thesis, which bears the earmarks of the expert and careful training of Professor Emil Ermatinger, was not available for com- ment last year; hence a word about it now should not be amiss. Mrs. Field offers us the first comprehensive study of Tieck's treatment of miracles, ranging from his earliest unpublished works of 1789 to his last novel, Vittoria Accorcnmbona (1840). Previously only certain periods of his life or certain aspects of his treatment had been considered by such writers as Hemmer and Thalmann, respectively. As was to be expected in the case of a dualist like Tieck, his miracles turn out to be a device for escaping from the world of realities. He would flee to the realm of wonders but requires a material construction of that realm in order to convince himself of its potency. Only late in life,, in such a novel as Der Aufruhr in den Cevennen, does he embrace a more orthodox, religious attitude toward the awesome mysteries of life and arrive at a more positive philosophy. As early as 19929 Hermann Gumbel, in Romantik-Farschungen (Niemeyer), pointed to the gradual clarification of Tieck, culminating in his mature attitude toward "das Wunder " in the late 'twenties. Mrs. Field's study supports and fortifies this view. What the present writer misses most in her dissertation is a discussion of Tieck's attitude toward fatalism. At least in his early years there seems to be some link between fate and miracle, but as yet it has not been clearly uncovered. Perhaps a future dissertation will be devoted to this fruitful subject, which has not yet been exhausted by any means. A discussion of Tieck's reaction to the sublime would also have been to the point, especially as it appears in his early paper Ueber da8 Erhabene. (E. H. Z.) Linding, H. Der Prosastil Ludwig Tiecks. Leipsic, 1938. Schnurr- pfeil und Steinmetz. Pp. 139. Matenko, Percy. Tieck's Russian Friends. PMLA 55 (1940). 1129-1145. The author of this article, who is well known as a Tieck scholar, has here undertaken to investigate the relations of the German romanticist to Russian relatives, friends and visitors. No German literary figure was so lionized by the intelligentsia of Europe between 1830 and 1840 as was the famous litterateur and dramatic reciter of Dresden. English, American, French and Russian visitors to the Saxon capital fairly flocked to his house or came to Dresden expressly to see him, and have left glowing accounts of his per- sonality and hospitality. Matenko throws much new light upon the Russian aspects of this unique idolization, which is of added interest since the appearance, in 1934, of Otto P. Peterson's Schiller in Russland, 1785-1805. Of special significance is Matenko's discussion of Tieck's contacts with</page><page sequence="30">30 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY Kuchelbecker and Zhukovski, which involved serious discussion of important literary personalities and problems, confirming certain literary opinions which Tieck had expressed elsewhere. We of the twentieth century, with all our mechanical progress, are indeed put to shame when we consider that the intellectual life of the early nineteenth century was in many respects more wholesome and certainly more international than is our life today.

As if in anticipation of Bonaccorsi's (see under name) speculation, Costa has re-written the famous novel in dramatic form, but for want of theatrical inventiveness, it is less than successful. Flori, Ezio. I1 Figliastro del Manzoni. Milano, 1939. Instituto editoriale cisalpino. Two volumes. Pp. 376, 485. We learn surprisingly little that is new about Manzoni, but much that is fresh about his literary friends, Rosmini in particular. Mascia, F. S. Poesia e religione nell'arte di Alessandro Manzoni.

Wichterich, P. Mazzini, il profeta della nuova Italia. Milano, Garzanti. Pp. 280. Another dismal attempt to make Mazzini a precursor of Mussolini. Monti. Cian, Vittorio. Postille ad una relazione su "L'Idea unitaria nel Risorgimento." Giornale storico della letteratura italiana 114 (1940). 149-190. As against the traditional charges of indifference, even treason, to country, Cian rehabilitates Monti, with apparently sound documentation. Pellico. Ravello, Federico. L'Autografci delle " Mie Prigioni " e la lingua del Pellico. Giornale storico della letteratura ita- liana 115 (1940). 39-58. A good study of the development of Pellico's style in its evolution from dialectical impurities to a Tuscan idiom, as revealed by a searching com- parison between the manuscript and the published work. 3</page><page sequence="34">34 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY SCANDINAVIAN (By W.
