<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERO WARRIORS FROM CORINTH AND LAKONIA (PLATEs 63 and 64) flURING EXCAVATIONS in the Corinthian Potters' Quarter by the American School AL} of Classical Studies at Athens, a terracotta relief plaque was found in a small votive deposit east of the so-called Circular South Shrine. 1 Although only the upper right corner of the plaque is preserved, a warrior, facing right, can be clearly seen (P1. 63:a).2 The man, preserved to the waist, has short curly hair and a small pointed beard. He wears a high-crested Corinthian helmet pushed back on his forehead and in his left hand carries a shield shown in perspective from the inside. Unless a corselet had originally been rendered solely in paint, the warrior is shown nude. The modeling of his upper body, shown in nearly frontal view, is quite competent, with close-knit musculature and a foreshortened left arm. The moldmade plaque, of local Corinthian clay, preserves traces of white slip and red color and a suspension hole in front of the crest of the helmet. It may be dated to the second half of the 5th century B.C. Corinth XV,i,p. 32. A preliminary version of this article was presented at the 93rd Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in Chicago (for the abstract, see AJA 96, 1992, pp. 357-358). I wish to express my gratitude to Charles K. Williams II for allowing me to study the Corinth plaque; to Nancy Bookidis for her hospitality in Corinth; to Chrysanthos Christou, who granted me permission to publish the Amyklai plaques; and to George Steinhauer for permission to publish the Chatzis plaque. Norman J. E. Austin, Keith DeVries, Gloria Ferrari Pinney, A.

For a parallel to the Corinthian helmet, dated to the second half of the 5th century B.C., see Dintsis 1986, Beil. 6, no. 227, p. 89, pl. 37:9. Another relief plaque depicting a warrior has been discovered in Corinth under the floor of a shop in the South Stoa: Corinth XII, no. 218, pp. 17, 40-41, pls. 17, 143:b. Although at first glance the pose seems very similar to that on the plaque from the Potters' Quarter, there are some small differences. On the plaque from the South Stoa the pose is more active, the sword is held lower, and the lower body is shown in profile. The left arm is extended, probably grasping an opponent, while the left leg is raised high. The man wears a cuirass rendered solely in color and has a scabbard hanging by his side. The foreshortening is not so successful (especially on the left shoulder) as that on the Potters' Quarter plaque. The South Stoa plaque should probably be dated somewhere in the first half of the 5th century B.C., a date that would account for the frontal rendering of the eye.

This typically Corinthian stele shrine was built over a ruined house to honor the family hero or god worshiped while the house was still in use. Dated to the late 5th century B.C., like other stele shrines it was not long in use.4 Three other mechanically related plaques depicting a warrior have been discovered in Lakonia; all were made of local clay. The first plaque was found during rescue excavations in 1973 in a votive deposit at Sparta located in the Chatzis plot on the east side of the city. The plaque (P1. 64:a) preserves only the head of the warrior with a suspension hole in exactly the same place as that in the Corinthian plaque.5 The deposit, though only partially excavated for technical reasons, turned up several more plaques representing riders, banqueters, and seated and standing figures, as well as vases of regular and miniature size and figurines. These finds date from the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. An enclosure wall unearthed nearby and tiles found in the deposit point to the existence of a shrine that included a building of some kind.6 The other two Lakonian plaques were found in a large votive deposit excavated from 1956 to 1961 near the church of Agia Paraskevi in modern Amyklai. The deposit produced more than 10,000 objects, including vases of regular and miniature size, terracotta figurines, a disk akroterion, and hundreds of terracotta relief plaques representing mainly seated and standing figures, riders, and banqueters. The objects from the Amyklai deposit range in date from the 7th century B.C. to the Early Hellenistic period.7 The offerings have been securely associated with the sanctuary of Alexandra/Kassandra and Agamemnon mentioned by Pausanias (3.19.6) as located in that area.8 The identification is supported by 5th-century dedicatory inscriptions on vases from the deposit mentioning the names of Alexandra and Agamemnon9 and by the discovery of two Hellenistic monuments nearby: a marble throne with a dedication to Alexandra10 and a stele inscribed with an honorary decree that included a provision that the stele be set up at Alexandra's sanctuary. 1I1 The first Amyklaian warrior plaque preserves the warrior to the thighs (P1. 64:b). 12 He is striding and holds a short dagger in his right hand.

The snake, as seen clearly on the second, smaller Amyklaian plaque (P1. 64:c),13 coils between the legs of the warrior with its tail just below his right hand. Detailed on-site examination and accurate measurements of the one Corinthian and the three Lakonian plaques have proved beyond doubt that they all derived from the same archetype. The plaques from Corinth and Sparta were cast in the same mold, which was very likely the first-generation mold;'4 the plaques from Amyklai, which are of smaller dimensions, were made in molds of the second and third generation. We thus have two plaques, both cast in the first-generation mold: one from Corinth, made in the local Corinthian clay; one from Sparta, made in the local Lakonian clay. One may conclude that these plaques most likely represent a case of mold sharing, the first-generation mold having traveled between Corinth and Lakonia.15 The sharing of molds between two centers of terracotta production, as a result of sale or export, was not very common in the ancient world.16 A more widespread practice was the import of a finished piece to a center and the subsequent local manufacture from that piece of a second-generation mold. The second-generation mold and casts would have been of smaller dimensions due to the shrinkage of clay. In this way, later generations of terracottas from the same series would be made in the local clay of the new center. 17 The question that immediately arises in the case of the warrior plaques concerns the origin of the mold: was it made in Corinth or Lakonia? Since there are almost no imports in the Potters' Quarter, it seems more likely that the series was created in a Corinthian workshop;18 the first-generation mold must have then been taken to Lakonia, where it was used by a local craftsman to produce several plaques of the first generation and, from derivative molds, plaques of the second and third generations. 19 A significant implication of this transfer is that warrior imagery was considered appropriate for cults in both Corinth and Lakonia.20 THE FIGHTING WARRIOR Proceeding now to the iconography of the warrior, it may be noticed that the pose is a common one for an attacking fighter. The type seems to have originated in large-scale 13 Sparta Museum A6225/3. Two adjoining pieces from the lower right corner preserved with part of the left edge.

I would like to thank Ronald Stroud, who pointed this out to me. 19 Keith DeVries suggested to me another possibility: that a craftsman migrating from Corinth to Lakonia may have taken the mold with him. 20 Cf.

The Attic hero Theseus is very often shown in this pose, although he appropriately wears an Attic helmet.22 In the sculptured friezes from Bassai and Gjolbaschi-Trysa, similar warriors fight the Amazons.23 Late-5th-century coins of Syracuse represent the hero Leukaspis holding sword and shield and again wearing an Attic helmet.24 (Leukaspis was a mythical Sicilian warrior who died fighting for his country and was worshiped thereafter as a hero.25) The type of the fighting warrior with Corinthian helmet was employed for Aias, son of Oileus, represented on 4th-century coins of Opuntian Lokroi.26 A stone relief found in the area of Alea-Tegea represents a similar warrior. The work is dated to the second half of the 4th century B.C., but its inscription, with the name EXEMOE, is much later, of the 1st or 2nd century after Christ.27 Echemos was a local hero of Tegea, and Pausanias, in his visit to the area (8.53.10), mentions his grave and a stele depicting his battle against Hyllos. It has been argued that the Alea relief is the one Pausanias saw. The relief was originally part of a frieze decorating an unknown monument and was later reworked and reused in Echemos' heroon with the addition of his name.28 A large number of heroes do indeed figure as warriors in the legends associated with them. They were venerated by the entire local community as protectors and would be expected to help in times of danger.29 Thus Theseus was said to have appeared at Marathon fighting at the head of the Athenians,30 and Echetlaios, a local hero whose name was revealed later by the Delphic oracle, fought there with his plough.3' Phylakos and Autonoos, two native heroes of Delphi, defended their land at the time of the Persian invasion,32 and the Salaminians Telamon and Aias were invoked before the battle at 21 Bulle 1930, pp. 186-187; Barron 1972, esp. pp. 35-40.

It is interesting to note here the suggestion made by Simon (1977, p. 18) that the warrior offering a cock to Persephone depicted on a Lokrian plaque (PriAckner 1968, pl. 6) could be identified with the hero Aias, son of Oileus. 27 Tegea Museum 2294; Pikoulas 1981, pp. 283-286, pl. 9. The only difference from the warrior on the Lakonian plaques is that the shield is held out in front, so that the whole inner side shows. 28 Pikoulas 1981, loc. cit. 29 Dentzer 1982, p. 480; Brelich 1958, pp. 91-92; Kearns 1990, esp. pp. 323-334. 30 Plutarch, Thes. 35.5. 31 Pausanias 1.32.5;Jameson 1951. 32 Herodotos 8.38-39; Pausanias 10.8.7.</page><page sequence="5">HERO WARRIORS FROM CORINTH AND LAKONIA 249 Salamis.33 Finally, the Lokrians left a position in their ranks for Aias, the son of Oileus.34 The importance given to the protective aspect of the local hero is clearly demonstrated in the story related by Herodotos, according to which the Spartans, on the advice of the Delphic oracle, had to recover the bones of Orestes from Tegea in order to be able to defeat the Tegeans.35 THE SNAKE What distinguishes the warrior on the Lakonian and Corinthian plaques from all other depictions is the presence of the snake. Although warriors are sometimes depicted fighting a snake, the scheme of a fighting warrior with a snake simply accompanying him and with no indication of a combat or even an interaction between the two36 is, to my knowledge, found nowhere else. A similar combination, but with the warrior simply standing, is found on terracotta plaques deposited with other offerings during the Early Hellenistic period in the area of a tholos tomb at Voidokilia, Messenia. These are oblong plaques representing a frontal warrior wearing a short chiton and cuirass. He sports a helmet and with his left hand holds a shield shown in profile; his right arm is bent and holds a vertical spear. A snake is uncoiling behind the warrior, starting from the right side of the plaque and going up along the left.37 Despite the static pose of the warrior, the snake clearly associates 33 Herodotos 8.64. Before the battle at Plataia a sacrifice was offered to seven local archegetai: Plutarch, Arist. 11.4. 34 Pausanias 3.19.12. 35 Herodotos (1.67-68) and Pausanias (3.3.6) give a detailed account of how the Spartans accomplished this task (see also Vandiver 1991, pp. 34-38; Boedeker 1993; Malkin 1994, pp. 26-30). Pausanias (3.11.10) mentions a shrine of the Moirai in the Spartan agora, near which was a grave for Orestes, constructed after the transportation of his bones from Tegea. Huxley (1979) argues that the bones of Orestes were discovered not in Tegea but at Oresthasion, to the southwest of Tegea; in this he follows Forrest (1968, pp. 73-76), who was the first to argue for a deliberate confusion between Orestes and the local hero of Arkadia, Oresthes. On the exact location of Oresthasion see most recently Drakopoulos 1991. Boedeker (1993) rejects the idea that there was a propagandistic aspect to the motive behind the transferal of Orestes' bones, supporting a new policy of the Spartans in favor of alliances instead of annexation. She argues instead that the Spartans acted in the framework of their general interest in their Achaean predecessors and imported Orestes, who by having no descendants in Sparta belonged not to individual families but to the polis as a whole. Although the propitiation of Orestes may indeed have had a local meaning for the Spartans, the possibility that this action may also have greatly served their political intentions of becoming one way or another sovereigns of the entire Peloponnese should not be downplayed. 36 As, for example, in a Late Archaic relief from Charouda, in the western Mani, which portrays a young warrior wearing a short chiton and greaves, facing a large erect snake: Gytheion Museum 1; Schroder 1904, pp. 44-46, fig. 6; Mitropoulou 1977, pp. 63-64, fig. 20; Andronikos 1956, pp. 301-302. The warrior is preparing to deposit his shield on the ground, where his Corinthian helmet already lies. A similar erect snake appears on another Lakonian relief, in front of a standing youth who perhaps holds a spear: Sparta Museum 558; Tod and Wace 1906, p. 189 (no. 558); Mitropoulou 1977, p. 66, fig. 21. 37 Peppa-Papaioannou 1987-1988, pp. 259, 270, fig. 12; Korres 1982, p. 204, pl. 136:ox; Korres 1985, pl. 30:1; Korres 1988, pp. 315, 320, fig. 6. In all, approximately ten examples of warrior plaques have been discovered, belonging to three different mold series; the snake is missing from the third mold series.</page><page sequence="6">250 GINA SALAPATA the type with that of the fighting warrior on the Lakonian and Corinthian plaques by which it was certainly inspired. The snake in this context lends a more-than-human quality to the warrior figure and must therefore have a symbolic meaning.38 There are strong reasons to believe, as I will argue, that the snake was included in the scene on the Corinthian and Lakonian plaques in order to specify and accentuate the heroic nature of the warrior figure.39 The snake, a creature that evokes fear, awe, and fascination, has a very wide range of meanings. In ancient Greece, as in many other cultures, it was closely associated with the earth, probably because it crawls on and lives in the ground and appears suddenly from holes. Herodotos reports that it was considered a "child of the earth",40 and indeed many mythological snake monsters, like Typhon, Ladon, Echidna, and Hydra, claimed the goddess Earth as their mother or grandmother.41 In the eyes of modern scholars, the characteristics of the snake have given rise to a number of associations: since it resides in recesses of the earth and is frequently seen near graves, the snake has been connected with the dead and with chthonic cults; its relation with the earth, where seeds germinate, has also associated it with life and fertility; moreover, the snake has been considered a symbol of immortality and resurrection by virtue of its ability to renew its skin.42 The ancient literary tradition points particularly to the association of the snake with heroes. According to Plutarch (Cleom. 39) there was an old folk belief that the snake possessed a demonic character pertinent to heroes.43 In 219 B.C., for example, the appearance of a large snake around the head of the Spartan king Kleomenes while his dead body was being crucified inspired fear in King Ptolemy, who interpreted this as a sign that Kleomenes was more than an ordinary human being. Most important, it created a commotion and excitement among the common people, who declared Kleomenes a hero and son of the gods. This contrasts with attempts by the Alexandrian intellectuals to provide a "scientific" explanation for this phenomenon: that snakes grow naturally out of the decayed human body. At the end of his account, Plutarch clearly states that "the ancients associated the snake more than any other animal with heroes."44 Similarly, the 38 Apollodoros (Bibl. 2.8.5) mentions the drakon as semeion in Lakedaimon. That the snake is not simply a reptile but represents something else is shown by literary references to the kind of food offered to it; it is not given such favorites of real snakes as eggs or mice but instead honey cakes or gruel (Pausanias 6.20.2; schol. Aristophanes, Nub. 508). Such a practice may imply that in the eyes of the ancients the snake symbolized a creature of anthropomorphic characteristics or origins: see Roscher I, ii, 2467, s.v. Heros (F. Deneken); Kuster 1913, p. 136; Dentzer 1982, p. 498. 39 That the warrior figure may also have been an ancestor is not to be excluded, since heroes and ancestors of a family or community often overlapped: see Alcock 1991, p. 449, note 3; Whitley 1994, p. 214; Antonaccio 1994, pp. 390, 401. 40 Herodotos 1.78.3; Artemidoros 2.13. 41 Egli 1982, pp. 171, 201-203; Ktster 1913, pp. 87-100. The Athenian king Erechtheus was also yryerv4q (Herodotos 8.55), as was Ogygos, the first king of Thebes (Pausanias 9.5.1). 42 For the snake in general see Ktister 1913; Egli 1982; Bevan 1986. 43 Andronikos 1956, p. 285; Rhomaios 1914, pp. 213-215; Dentzer 1982, p. 498.

Seiffert (1911, p. 114) has argued that this last sentence was a later addition; this is not considered necessary by Rhomaios (1914, p. 214, note 1).</page><page sequence="7">HERO WARRIORS FROM CORINTH AND LAKONIA 251 scholiast to Aristophanes, Pl. 733 explains: "the snake was commonly placed next to the heroes and especially next to Asklepios."45 It should be stressed here that these particular references do not actually indicate the assimilation of a hero by the snake but only refer to it as his companion or attribute.46 On the other hand, some heroes, such as Kychreus, Sosipolis, and Asklepios, did appear in snake form, and Kekrops and Erechtheus were considered either snakes or creatures of half-human, half-snake shape.47 Along the same line, divine figures such as Zeus Ktesios, Zeus Philios, Zeus Meilichios, and the Agathos Daimon, all of whom were associated with domestic and ancestral cults, are known to have taken the form of a snake,48 probably because they developed out of old divinities associated with the earth.49 The ancestral qualities of the snake are apparent in some foundation myths, where a snake plays a decisive role as leader of the tribe.50 As is clear from its name, the tribe of Ophiogeneis in the Hellespont considered as their archegetes a hero who had metamorphosed from a snake (Strabo 13.1. 14).51 References to snakes at the Asklepieion XOLV6)( VFv xaxt tOLpd &amp;XOLc 5pXY bp6xovteg napetpOevtO o taLp&amp;fLw U t(6) 'AaxXV&lt;7tL(&amp;. It is possible that Asklepios became associated with the snake owing to his nature as hero and healer (in his case the boundaries between hero and god were fluid). On the close relation of Asklepios with the snake see Kuster 1913, pp. 133-137. Cf.

On the basis of Pausanias (1.36.1), who says that the snake that appeared among the ships in Salamis was declared by the Delphic oracle to have been the Salaminian hero Kychreus, it has been supposed that heroes customarily assumed the form of a snake: Dentzer 1982, p. 497; Kuster 1913, p. 100. Pausanias' reference, however, is not exact. According to Hesiod (Strabo 9.393) a snake, having been fostered by Kychreus in Salamis, finally became the attendant of Demeter at Eleusis. Thus the earliest reference to Kychreus deals not with his snake form but with a snake associated with him, perhaps because the hero was an aboriginal earth spirit. 47 Roscher I, ii, cols. 2466-2469, s.v.

Perhaps this domestic cult was devoted to the ancestor of the family and became similar to the cult of the archegetes and the eponymous hero (Dentzer 1982, p. 500). On ancestors see, most recently, Antonaccio 1993. 49 Seiffert 1911, p. 116; Kuster 1913, pp. 105-107, 145, with references to several monuments.

The precise reason behind this association, however, remains unclear to us. One could argue that the snake, originally an underworld being, became associated with heroes because heroes were persons who had died and who were closely attached to their real or alleged graves,55 or, more likely, because this animal, so intimately connected with the earth and tied to particular locations, better expressed the restricted locale and autochthonous nature of most heroes, especially founders and eponymous heroes.56 It is also possible that in the minds of the ancients the snake represented such figures of the remote past as the Hesiodic Silver Generation, the hypochthonioi, who were honored after their death and, by definition, resided under the earth. The hero, therefore, being buried and attached to a specific location, would have kept company with the original subterraneous inhabitants, who were anonymous and collectively embodied by the snake.57 Another commonly argued explanation is that the snake was first the manifestation of all chthonic spirits, including heroes; with the advance of anthropomorphic concepts it was demoted, becoming the sacred animal of some chthonic gods and heroes and thus their attribute. Its presence then would indicate that a scene takes place in the Underworld or is to be connected with the chthonic powers.58 and solidarity, The French scholars, however, have argued against an earlier origin for these Classical Attic institutions. 52 E.g., Aristomenes, the hero of the second Messenian war (Pausanias 4.14.7); Brelich 1958, pp. 221, 318-319; Kuster 1913, pp. 100-104, 145. 53 See, for example, the relief from Charouda (note 36 above), where it is clear that the snake is an independent superhuman creature being venerated by the youth. Andronikos (1956, pp. 301-303) has considered the relief a dedication to a hero or daimon appearing in the form of a snake, the warrior being the dedicator. Hibler (1993, p. 202) identified the youth as a warrior who died in battle and was subsequently heroized, but he did not comment on the snake. 54 Seiffert 1911, pp. 125-126; Ktister 1913, pp. 56-60. According to Ktxster (1913, p. 74) the snake in depictions might designate a hero tomb. 55 Cf. Kontoleon 1970, p. 32, note 1. 56 Kuster 1913, pp. 97-100; Roscher I, ii, col. 2470, s.v. Heros (F.

Effenberger (1972,</page><page sequence="9">HERO WARRIORS FROM CORINTH AND LAKONIA 253 THE CORINTHIAN SNAKE STELAI In Lakonian art the snake is found very frequently, but its role in the context of Lakonian ideology remains obscure. It appears in vase painting, Dioskouroi reliefs, the well-known hero reliefs (ranging in date from the 6th century B.C. to the Roman period), and terracotta relief plaques, as well as in the round.59 The importance of this reptile in Lakonia is apparent in a series of stone reliefs, probably dating to the 5th century B.C., where erect snakes appear in isolation.60 The snake is particularly popular in the finds from the Amyklai deposit, from which the two warrior plaques came; it appears on vases, terracotta plaques depicting seated and standing figures, and with a seated man in a terracotta figurine.6' Particularly striking is the association of the snake with the figures on the stone hero reliefs and the terracotta plaques. The most common scheme consists of a seated man holding a kantharos, while a snake is writhing in the field and sometimes approaches the cup; the man may be accompanied by his consort, seated next to him, and by various attending figures or adorants. I have argued elsewhere that reliefs and plaques decorated with such depictions were offerings dedicated to heroes in Lakonia, an area exceptionally rich in hero shrines.62 The snake is also a familiar motif in Corinthian art, and its specific association with the warrior survived into later periods. A class of typically Corinthian votive offerings first made during the 5th century B.C. has been discovered in mostly Hellenistic deposits in the Corinthian forum. These are the so-called Snake Stelai, small cutout terracotta reliefs representing a stele with a molding at the base and top and crowned by a Corinthian helmet shown in profile, usually to the right; a snake is depicted slithering up the shaft of the stele (P1. 63:b).63 At an earlier date, similar terracotta "stelai" were made with one or two snakes but had no helmet on top.64 p. 136) objects that, although several chthonic gods appeared in the form of a snake, the latter was never their attribute. 59 For Lakonian vase painting see Stibbe 1972; Stibbe 1994, pp. 75-85; Pipili 1987.

Thus, for example, Snake Stelai, banqueters, and riders were among the finds in a small hypaethral temenos constructed over Protogeometric graves in the Corinthian forum. Although the cult itself was established in the late 7th century B.C., the temenos, with the enclosing wall and an offering table, was built later, sometime during the 6th century B.C., and remained in use until the mid 2nd century B.C.65 This type of shrine has been classified as a hero shrine by Williams and defined as a cult area usually associated with graves and probably dedicated to a hero or ancestor.66 What is the iconographic relationship between the warrior plaques and the Snake Stelai crowned with a helmet? Actual weapons and armor had long been deposited as funerary gifts in the graves of warriors. They must also have been placed on top of the grave, as shown on an Attic red-figured lekythos on which a young man, most likely the dead warrior himself, seems to be in the process of placing a Corinthian helmet on the grave stele, while a shield already leans against it.67 It is indeed probable that the idea of using painted or sculptured armor as a decorative motif on grave stelai evolved from such a practice.68 On a white-ground lekythos by the Thanatos Painter (third quarter of the 5th century B.C.) a helmet is painted on the upper part of the grave stele of a warrior who is being carried off by Hypnos and Thanatos.69 Stelai crowned by helmets were also used to represent the marker over the grave of a mythical warrior. On a Lucanian Panathenaic amphora of around 380 B.C. Elektra, Orestes, and Pylades are shown next to the tomb of Agamemnon, which is represented as a stele crowned by a Corinthian helmet, with the king's name, Agamemnon, written on the shaft.70 Votive terracotta plaques representing a stele topped with a helmet have also been discovered in the Spartan colony of Taras in South Italy and have been dated to the 4th century B.C. The helmet in this case is shown full face.71 Similar stelai appear on other plaques as part of a larger scene that includes a naked man half sitting, half reclining on a 65 Williams and Fisher 1973, pp. 2-12; Williams, MacIntosh, and Fisher 1974, pp. 1-6; Williams 1981, p. 410. 66 Williams 1981, p. 410, who distinguishes this type from the stele shrine built over a house: the Corinthian warrior plaque was most likely associated with a stele shrine (see p. 246 above). 67 Weisshaeupl 1893, cols. 17-18, pl. 3. The warrior does not seem to be a visitor, as Weisshaeupl believes.

A frontal helmet and a round shield are fixed on the stele;72 more significant, a snake is winding up the stele, an element that associates the Tarantine terracottas with the Corinthian Snake Stelai.73 On another similar plaque there is no armor on the stele, but there seem to be some offerings on its top; in this case the man is giving the snake something to drink from a mesomphalic phiale.74 I would suggest that the Corinthian Snake Stelai, like the Tarentine plaques, were votive offerings representing the grave monument of a hero, with the pieces of armor on the stele manifesting his qualities as warrior. The snake crawling on the face of the stele would make the heroic association clear.75 Oscar Broneer, on the other hand, has suggested that the Corinthian Snake Stelai represent the turning post in the race track, with the snake pointing to the chthonic character of the cult with which the Snake Stelai were associated.76 This view is certainly influenced by his assumption that not only did the deposits in which the Snake Stelai were found come from hero shrines but also the offerings alluded to equestrian events in the hero's honor.77 The nature of the votive offerings may indeed point to a heroic (or funerary) cult,78 and there also seems to be a relationship between columns (or pillars) as grave markers and columns as turning posts in racecourses.79 I do not find it necessary, however, in view of the similar Tarentine plaques, to move beyond an interpretation of the Snake Stelai as a representation of the marker over a hero's grave, specifically a hero warrior, as is shown by the helmet. CONCLUSION During the 5th century B.C. the two Dorian cities of Corinth and Sparta were very closely linked politically in the Peloponnesian League. In fact, Corinth was at least partly 72 Compare the Attic stele mentioned in note 68 above. 73 Bartoccini 1936, p. 167, fig. 78. According to Wuilleumier (1939, p. 507) the arms recall the armed god on the Lokrian plaques and the heroized dead. Cf. Epameinondas' grave described by Pausanias (8.11.8) as having a column bearing a shield decorated with a snake. 74 Bartoccini 1936, p. 167, fig. 79; Wuilleumier 1939, pp. 507-508, note 1.

Robinson 1906, pp. 172-173; Callaghan 1978, pp. 24-28; Dentzer 1982, p. 480; Alcock 1991, p. 461. Hagg (1987) is reluctant to assign a "heroic character" to a deposit solely on the basis of the types of offerings unless they are present in large quantities. 79 For the use of a grave marker as a turning post for horse and chariot races, see II. 23.329-33 (funeral games for Patroklos); Pausanias 6.21.15-19, 10.37.4 (hero Taraxippos buried at the turning post of the racecourse at Olympia).

The image of the fighting warrior accompanied by the snake on the Corinthian and Lakonian plaques must have been appropriate for both areas and could have served similar needs. Who were the recipients of these plaques? Archaeological and iconographic evidence points to the heroic nature of the cult figures. The iconography of the warrior was generic enough to enable dedicators to offer the plaques to different deities in Corinth, Sparta, and Amyklai.82 In each particular sanctuary the warrior would presumably be identified with the locally honored hero, so that people would have no doubt as to whom the figure was supposed to represent.83 The warrior on the Corinth plaque, if indeed, as seems likely, it was dedicated at a stele shrine, may have represented a hero or family ancestor. His identity remains unknown to us since no inscriptions have been recovered. This is also the case with the numerous later cults at Mycenaean tombs, which have generally been associated with heroes.84 The absence of inscriptions, however, or the use of the appellation "hero" (as is occasionally the case) does not necessarily mean that the worshiped hero was anonymous or thought of as a generic figure.85 Are we justified in assuming that since he remains anonymous to us he was also anonymous to his worshipers? Or that since he was called only "hero" his name was not known to the people of the region? One could argue that there would simply be no need to mention the specific name of the hero since in the restricted locale where his worship was performed everybody would have known that the figure represented the hero of the sanctuary or of the area.86 80 Ste. Croix 1972. 81 Rolley 1977, p. 129. 82 Cf. Miller-Ammerman 1991, pp. 207, 227. 83 Cf. Dentzer 1982, p. 454; Broneer 1942, p. 132, note 12; Roscher I, ii, col. 2511, s.v. Heros (F. Deneken). 84 Antonaccio (1993, 1994, and 1995) rightly emphasized the distinction between "tomb cult" and "hero cult" in the Iron Age as different phenomena but with parallel occurrence. Tomb cult, which goes back to the 10th century but was intensified in the late 8th century B.C., is short-lived and consists of offerings deposited at tombs (mostly Mycenaean). Hero cult, on the other hand, is a ritual action performed at specific locations, often with monumental or at least permanent architecture, and is repeated at regular intervals for a long time. But her conclusion that the cults at Mycenaean and later tombs were directed to ancestors "adopted" by people who, though not linked by blood, sought to establish kinship, though probably true in some instances, cannot be generally applied. One should allow for variability in tomb cults and in the reasons for their establishment in various regions and even within the same community (see Morris 1988; Whitley 1988, pp. 176-181; Alcock 1991, p. 453): sometimes the accidental discovery of an "ancient" tomb called for appeasement; or the "resident" of the area was propitiated out of fear or respect by the farmer who started cultivating the land; in yet other cases the old aristocrats or citizens of a polzs reacted to protect their rights to a territory by appropriating the local hero. 85 One of Antonaccio's distinctions between hero and tomb cult is the presence or lack of inscriptions: hero cults are directed to recipients identified by name or given just the appellation "hero", while tomb cults remain anonymous. For examples of dedications "to the hero" see Dentzer 1982, p. 454, note 5. 86 The heroes were so closely tied to their territory that often the name was not used and they were distinguished by a purely local designation as the hero of that city or country: Rudhardt 1958, p. 133; Dentzer 1982, p. 360, note 524; Farnell 1921, p. 84. Furtwangler (1883-1887, pp. 21-22) remarked that</page><page sequence="13">HERO WARRIORS FROM CORINTH AND LAKONIA 257 In the case of the Lakonian plaques, however, we are luckier. Although very little can be determined about the recipient of the plaque at Sparta, the two Amyklaian plaques can confidently be associated with a specific hero. At the Amyklai sanctuary of Alexandra/Kassandra, cult was bestowed upon the Achaean king Agamemnon and was centered around his grave (see p. 246 above). Since he lacked descendants in Sparta, Agamemnon must have been worshiped not as ancestor but as hero.87 In fact, Agamemnon bridges both meanings of the word "hero", the epic and the cultic.88 He was not only a panhellenic Homeric hero but also a local Lakedaimonian one, since according to a variant tradition, his palace was located in Lakonia.89 In the framework of their interest in the Achacan kingdom that preceded them, the Spartans worshiped Agamemnon at the place where he was supposedly murdered and buried. The iconography of the warrior plaques is indeed very appropriate for the preeminent commander of the Greek army during the Trojan expedition, who is represented according to the epic ideal as a mature warrior.90 His heroic nature was specified and emphasized through the addition of the snake placed next to him.
