<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthologies Glas: New Russian Writing. 13: A Will and a Way. Natasha Perova, Arch Tait, eds. Moscow. Glas (Ivan R. Dee, distr.). 1997 (Â© 1996). 222 pages, ill. $14.95. ISBN 5-7172-0029-3. RUSSIAN The colorful cover photograph shows a gaunt waif with a boyish haircut positioned against a back- ground of stylized religious figures. Seemingly caught off guard with her finger in her mouth, the young woman stares with wary distrust at the potential reader. The enig- matic cover appears at odds with the name of the volume, for the depicted figure does not exude the determination that the title, "A Will and a Way," suggests. The design is intriguing, however, and draws the reader into this latest installment of the magazine which has brought contem- porary Russian writing to the English speaker; it contains short stories, drama, poetry, novel fragments, and fairy tales for "grown-up children," all written by women. The first piece, "Equation with Two Knowns," by the dramatist and feminist activist Maria Arbatova, features an obstetrician who is called to attend a birth in the middle of the night by the grandfather-to-be, who in fact turns out to be the physician's first lover. Employing a minimal- ist approach and identifying her characters only as "She" and "He," Arbatova portrays the two individuals in their exploration of a liaison which failed. Distortions, misrep- resentations, and half-truths mask the events which oc- curred fourteen years ago as He and She wend their way backward through elusive memories and actual disap- pointments to the pain she experienced with her abortion after their affair: "I waited, expected you to come and help me cope with the shame and fear. . . . The abortion was done without any anaesthetic, but no stinting on the swearing. When I left, hoarse from screaming and horror, I felt like I'd been disemboweled. My soul and flesh had been scraped off. Only the shell remained." Likening all the men in her life to her first lover, she cannot ignore the suffering he caused, and her thoughts are reiterated in a refrain: "A whole lifetime isn't enough for me to forget and forgive that nightmare and shame that I had to bear, because of you." She contemplates her relationship with her parents and with the men in her life: "Can't you understand, I'm not a woman. Or rather, I'm an incomplete woman. Everything womanly in me has been crushed. First by my parents, then by circumstances, then by those I loved." She envisions herself as an ar- mored car, and he counters, 'You are simply a frog princess, and I will undo the spell." But she rejects the wizardry of folktales; in fact, she is an abortionist who practices her trade humanely, without inflicting pain on the woman. Cynical and ironic, the piece delves into gen- der roles, but even this resolute physician reinforces tradi- tional stereotypes as she pampers her (adopted) son. Arbatova's "My Teachers," a chapter from an autobio- graphical novel, shows the main character surviving against the odds of lameness and feelings of inadequacy. A "person of the female sex was meant to be invisible." Arbatova dis- sects her "education" at the hands of malevolent or lecher- ous teachers who grade capriciously and persecute their students, failing them if they refuse their sexual advances. Dysfunctional families and deficient educational systems are exposed with wit and humor. Arbatova's two selections alone are reason enough to read A Will and a Way. Nina Gabrielyan's story "The Lilac Dressing Gown" mean- ders through childhood magic with its anthropomorphism, remi- niscent of Olesha's "Leompa" or Pasternak's "Childhood of Luvers." Combining puerile wonder (where a hair bow is en- visioned as an "idiotic propeller") and adult ratiocination (giving intricate scientific labels of insects) , the tale weaves through the iridescent prism of hazy childhood memories, in which the day's sensuous experiences turn into nocturnal nightmares. This is an enchanting story of self-discovery. The Russian literary tradition lives on in "On Upper Maslovka," by Dina Rubina, a widely published author who emigrated to Israel in 1988. Her tale unfolds against a carnivalesque setting of scandal, in which emotions froth uncontrollably, as in Dostoevsky's works, and where characters insult one another (there is a voyeuristic stair- case scene which recalls "The Double"). The reader en- counters oblique allusions to Pushkin's "Queen of Spades" as well as overt references to Bulgakov's "Heart of a Dog" (the homeless mutt is called Sharik). This excerpt is the first chapter of an eponymous novel, whose plot is unfortunately divulged in the notes. Irina Muravyova's style differs markedly from Rubina' s. Her stories "In Kropotkinskaya Street" and "The Forgot- ten Woman" contain more realistic situations, on the one hand, and more metaphoric language on the other. A woman has "mother-of-pearl eyelids," and the child has the face of an "aristocratic fox cub." "The Pure Zone," by Irina Polianskaya, has appeared in English in a slightly dif- ferent translation in Masha Gessen's Half a Revolution. Ludmila Petrushevskaya's three delightful "Fairy Tales for Grownup Children" and Larissa Miller's poetic prose piece and several verses complete the volume. Glas 13 is a very attractive publication, with full-page portraits and bi- ographical notes on the authors, additional illustrations, and several black-and-white photographs of legs and feet, which of course bring us back full circle to Pushkinian fetishes, Akh, noshki, noshki - which leads me to ponder, how much have we progressed after all?
