Totemism in Southern Nigeria. By N. W. Thomas, London. During my 1909-1910 tour I obtained information as to ritual prohi- bitions1 among the Edo or Bini people of Southern Nigeria. I collected a large number of genealogies and found that every family had one or more ritual prohibitions, either as to the use of certain animals or plants, or as to the performance of certain actions or the utterance of certain words. These pro- hibitions are known as awa or awaigbe (egbe = family) and associated with them is the practice of exogamy. There is one exception to the prohibition observed by a family: in many cases the animal, plant or action which is normally prohibited is actually prescribed as a part of the burial ceremonies; but at the conclusion of the rites, more especially if the forbidden animal or plant has been eaten, cere- monies of purification are performed precisely in the same way as if the ani- mal or plant had been eaten inadvertently in the course of ordinary daily life. The use of certain animals, plants and objects and the performance of certain actions is forbidden either absolutely or except on ceremonial occasions; in rare cases ordinary acts are forbidden when certain words, properly useable on such ceremonial occasions, have been pronounced in common daily life. These bans or prohibitions are of two kinds: 1. aw al /imi (awa ban, elim hea- ven) laid on a person by a priest, or incumbent on him as the worshipper of a certain ebo' 2. awaigbe (awa ban, egbe family) inherited in the male line, apparently whether the child be legitimate or not, from the actual father. In the Edo district I found few traces of descent in the female line, though in the north-east, in Fuga, the children accept the mother's bans without apparently passing them on to the next generation. In two cases at Iyawa the awaigbe was said to be derived from the mother's family; in the first case my informant was the head man of one of the quarters; the second case was that of the next man to him, who was said to be a stranger but was in fact descended from the same great grandfather (fa. fa. fa.)- The statement ap- peared to be entirely incorrect, inasmuch as the awa were the same in both cases, though there was no traceable connection between the mothers families; and the mothers came from entirely different parts of the country. There may however be some tradition of female descent among the descendents of Imok- pai, as my second informant assured me that he avoided calabash seed (ikbako) for his mother's family and calabash seed, though very common as awaigbe, never, so far as I know, occurs as awailimu 1 A summary of my information was published in Frazer's "Totemism and Exogamy", vol. II, p. 589 ss.</page><page sequence="2">Das Problem des Totemismus. 235 Where the ban on the awaigbe is not absolute it is used a) in burial customs; b) in annual sacrifice either to Osun or to ancestors; or c) as eni. It seems certain that some awaigbe are not used in any way; for men who had buried their fathers assured me that the forbidden animal was not used in any way; on the other hand in more than one case where a man of a cer- tain family stated that the awaigbe was not used, it turned out later, often when my second informant was more advanced in years, that it was in fact used. Not only were the members of the younger generation ignorant of whether the awaigbe was used in burial customs, but they were sometimes ignorant of whether they had any awaigbe or not. But allowing for a certain number of cases where the early death of a man's father or separation from his family accounted for this lack of information, I found a number of cases in which the existence of an awaigbe was denied on apparently good grounds. It must be understood that except where the awaigbe is used in burial customs there is nothing to distinguish it from the awailimi; some cases therefore of apparent non-use of the awaigbe in burial customs are probably due to the fact that the forbidden animal was an awailimi; this is the case specially where, out of three or four awa, only one or two are used in burial customs. As a rule the use of the awaigbe is absolutely prohibited and it may not even be touched. One family may not touch eggs, nor even eat from the same dish as those who have touched eggs and not washed. Odugu of Utekon may not eat food touched by a dog. At Iyowa Igodalo refused to pick up a squirrel which I shot, assuring me that if he touched his awaigbe, it would cause him to be ill; to eat it would entail death or at the least serious troubles of the digestive organs, swelling of the mouth and bleeding of the tongue. In one case I was informed that when the awaigbe was seen, members of the family had to leave the spot. Egwoma of Benin City may not bring iwewe into his house; a pot in which it is cooked may not be used. Eating char- coal or ashes is a mode of purification for an unwitting offender. On the other hand Adeyan, a most reliable informant, told me that his awaigbe was "bamboo" mat, but that he might burn bamboo, and that he might not burn it nor eat its seed; and Emocha of Idumowina may pluck a leaf which was his awaigbe; fowls may be kept though they are awaigbe. A wife may not use or eat the awaigbe of her husband; and the prohibition continues after his death as long as she is suckling a child of his. A husband is not obliged to respect his wife's awaigbe in the same way; he informs himself of it, not only to avoid breaking the exogamic rule but also to inform the other inmates of his house, so that it may not be given to her unwittingly; in the case of sacrificial meats I was told that the husband might eat them even though they were his wife's awaigbe but that he had to wash his hands with charcoal afterwards; but it was not clear whether this was an exception to the ordinary rule. In general the husband is unable to say what his wives' awaigbe are. To the wife's rule of avoidance Adeyan's family provided another ex- ception; for a burial in his family the bamboo mat required to be taken from</page><page sequence="3">236 N. W. Thomas, one of his wives; but this rule, he said, was that of the old people; to-day all the family regard the mat as unclean. Where a given animal is prescribed as a sacrifice, the ordinary man will substitute a fowl for it; sacrificial meats are not mixed as a rule, so that those whose awaigbe are among them can easily avoid infringing their ban. Where a priest forbids an animal which he is required to sacrifice, he kills it and washes his hands with charcoal; he may not eat it. As a rule there is no explanation for the existence of an awaigbe; but Ojumo relates that an ancestor had once upon a time eaten ihiehie when strangers were announced; he had not washed his mouth and some of the beans remained upon his teeth; he thereupon forbad it to all his descendants. I heard the same story elsewhere in a vaguer form. In the family of Idehin the following story is told to account for the awaigbe. A ancestor, Iyasenonemi, was a poor man and a trader. One day he went down the Benin River and saw a big boa crossing, on whose back were growing plants; he thought it was land and stepped on it; when he got to the other side the boa sank down with a great noise and the man was amazed. When he became a great man he called his family and said that they were not to Ã©at snake, for if the boa had not been kind to him he would have lost his life. He then took exwail and cursed all who should eat it, and anyone who eats it unless unwittingly must die. It has already been mentioned that the awaigbe may be used under cer- tain circumstances. The most common use tho which it is put is in the burial customs; here food, animals or plants are prepared by cooking or used in the raw state; they are offered to the feet of the dead man, commonly for seven days, for four days in one case, for one day (i. e. twice) in one case and once only in one case. The food thus offered is a) eaten by the family (36 cases) or put to their mouth and then thrown away (6 cases), b) it is simply thrown away (17 cases); or it is given to strangers to eat (3 cases). In three cases it is not offered to the dead man but used in the annual sacrifice either to ancestors or to Osun. In twenty-two further cases objects, actions or actions after certain words are forbidden; and in one case the awaigbe is used as ehi and hung up with a string of cowries round it. In a number of cases not completely enumerated, the awaigbe is said not to be used at all in burial customs. In the cases where the family eat the awaigbe, in one case, it is only the sacrificed portion which is so consumed, the remainder is thrown away; in one case, the food is first sent to the head of the house and shared out by him; and in one case, the various awaigbe are some of them offered and eaten, others offered and thrown away. In one case, a dog is said to be cut in two on the grave, but I was unable to find out whether it was afterwards offered or eaten. One of the three cases in which the offering was said to be eaten by strangers I could not verify, as it was the awaigbe of a wife from a distance;</page><page sequence="4">Das Problem des Totemismus. 237 the second case was that of an immigrant from the Kukuruku country; the third case was not actually a native of the village but was an immigrant from a neighboring village. The evidence for the annual sacrifice on the other hand is irreproachable. Osagbovo of Idumowina sacrifices the tortoise to Osun but gives the soup to strangers. Idehin of the same place forbids fufu on an iniegbe (plate) but uses it in the annual sacrifice to his father. Omoxaieke of Utekon forbids mashed yam, because his father was a child (i. e. descendant) of Ojima, king of Uhe; such people beat a drum when they eat mashed yam annually; there is a yearly sacrifice in which mashed yam is brought to the shrine of the father, and all men, women and children of the family take a little or eat or touch their mouths. Another account stated that the mashed yam was used in the sacrifice to the head but this statement was withdrawn in favor of the one already quoted. Certain actions are prohibited; one family squats to sacrifice and may not eat in this position. Another sacrifices after sweeping up the dirt and leaving it; they may not eat in ordinary life when they see dirt swept up and lying about; another may not eat food from a certain kind of plate. In other cases certain kinds of food are forbidden not absolutely but only if it has been prepared in certain circumstances or has been in certain positions. Some families prohibit food passed through the legs and food cut in six pieces. Fufu prepared the previous day is forbidden in another case; food touched by a fowl is forbidden in two cases and that over which a fowl has jumped in another. In two cases all decapitated animals are forbidden; in two cases the neck of a fowl, in one the head of a fowl. In each case this kind of food is offered in burial customs. Taking now the objects whose use is wholly or partially forbidden in daily life, we find one family forbids an ant's nest (Ulelefi) as a potrest, in another family it is used as ehi and may be seen hung from the eaves with a string of cowries round it but it is otherwise forbidden; the ant's nest is taken to use as an ehi at no special season. Another family forbids a basket cover, which is used in burial customs as a plate for butter (?), salt and pepper. In this same family irhielo rope, erhue and ika tree are used for soup; asoso leaf ist put at the feet but not otherwise used; an oil calabash is used to cover the pot for soup; when they sacrifice they lie down; all these things are forbidden in ordinary life. They also forbid anyone to eat in a room in which a child has been born in the previous seven days but I could trace no observance connected with this in burial customs. A calabash spoon, used for the soup, and a calabash cup, from which seven people pour water on the dead man's feet, are forbidden in other families. Also prohibited are: bamboo, used for a mat and for poles on which to lay the body; itui wood made into a box for some purpose on the day of death, it may however be used in building; irhielo rope, used for soup, laid on the shrine of the father, at the feet of the dead man; to tie yams over the door, or finally, to draw yams into the house after the customs</page><page sequence="5">238 N. W. Thomas, are over; itoto rope, used to tie up the bamboo mat; onigugu leaf, used to put beneath the dead man's feet and aiso, in the same family, laid on the grave; uguaxe leaf, laid beneath the body; and oxue, used as firewood. In one case there was mentioned among the awaigbe a woman's cloth burnt by fire; but this was not used in burial customs and really belongs to the things forbidden to women after marriage. Whenever the awaigbe is eaten in burial customs and in some instances where it is simply used, e. g. for firewood, a small creeping plant called afo with a red flower, common on new roads, is used to purify the person or place; the mouth is washed out with a decoction. In two cases certain words were used in the burial customs and it was forbidden to eat food if anyone pronounced them in ordinary life. In one family before eating of the food sacrificed to the dead man, one of the members says: gele - don't eat; in another one of them says: mueniasukbe - take yams and taste; these expressions are forbidden at other times. The following is a list of all the awaigbe I found in the Edo district; the examples are drawn mainly from Idumowina, Utekon, Eviakoi, Iyawa, Iguiximi and in a less degree from Edo itself; many of the awaigbe are found only in single cases, it is therefore probable that the list is far from complete. In the following table the numbers after the names of the different bans show the use to which they are put in burial or other rites. The uses are as follows: 1. Eaten by family. 2. Eaten by strangers. 3. Soup, thrown away. 4. Used in burial. 5. Annual sacrifice. 6. Not used. The bans are: 1. Abukpa (Oko), 2. Aihihi (beans) (4), 3. Antelope, 4. Arhemoto (snake) (6), 5.

The awaigbe descends in the male line, even when the child is illegiti- mate; but I omitted to ask whether the mother observed the ban for her child's father in this case. A man is forbidden to marry into a family having the same awaigbe as his own. I found one clear case of infraction in the case of a Christianised native; in the second case Asemota and Osanon of Utekon, who were sons of a daughter and son of Adaiho of the same place, were both credited with the same awaigbe - ikbuko - but unfortunately I did not observe the fact soon enough to make further enquiries. I got a vague story in Edo to the effect that when a family got too big the exogamous rule was changed by means of sacrificing a goat to the first people of the family; all the world was originally descended from one woman1. In a certain number of cases a family was found to have more than one awaigbe used in burial customs; others had awaigbe used in burial customs side by side with others which were not so used. For the reason given above it is impossible to say in the latter cases whether they are real awaigbe or not. I now give a table of these secondary awaigbe grouped according to their primaries, in this case I adhere to the order in which they were given to me. 1 16 32 50 45 15 85 46 84 12 74 16 64 56 82 12 94 31 46 64 68 13 84 85 32 61 71 50 15 30 33 68 76 84 15 32 33 88 84 16 15 21 This table is necessarily incomplete for two reasons. In many cases the wife was away and the husband was unable to name her awaigbe ' when she was dead it was rare to find her awaigbe recalled. From this it naturally follows that the table deals almost exclusively with the marriages of persons now living; it was hopeless to attempt to discover the awaigbe of a man's mother unless she were alive and able to speak for herself. Moreover there were many marriages in which the husband or wife had no awaigbe or were unwilling to mention it; the table deals therefore only with a proportion of the whole number of marriages in my genealogies. Â» The term awa is applied to forbidden things generally. If a man makes proposals to a woman his words are emeawu; she may not answer and must spit on the ground. 1 With this myth may be compared the case of Ova, in the Wea country, where, accor- ding to tradition, they were prevented from following the exogamous rule by the fact that all the other towns were hostile to them ; thereupon they solemnly abrogated the rule by carrying Egbam Ekute round the town. Darome, king of Iyage, proposed to do the same but died before his purpose was effected.</page><page sequence="7">240 N. W. Thomas, Certain things are forbidden to married women. They may not kneel on one knee to cook, not lift drink with the left hand; they may not use a cloth to wipe up fowl dung and then wear it again; not may they again put on a cloth which has a hole burnt in it when they are smoking. The wives of the family of the king of Ugo forbid bush rat, as long as they live in their husband's house; but their children may eat.it. If a woman living in her husband's house begins to menstruate, she lights a fire in the last room (owehe); some people may not see this fire because of Osun, others may not go there because of the woman; all Osun do not prohibit it. A woman in her father's house is not obliged to move away from her fellows during her period even though she may be betrothed. The gate of a village has many awa' connected with it; it is established in the first instance by a doctor when the village is founded and medicine is put down. There is a passage in the middle for the world at large, at the side for the women who are menstruating, or carrying fagots or any forbidden thing; a fowl may not be carried on the top of the load not a goat nor a sheep. On the other hand a dog may not be led through the gate; it must be carried. Ceremonies of purification are enjoined on those who infringe the rule, and chickens, alligator pepper and three kola nuts in one are employed. Cer- tain birds may not be eaten by any Bini; among these are the kafir tit the vulture and the owl. Awaigbe are found only sporadically outside the kingdom of Edo; to the north-east it is by no means uncommon to find a whole compound pro- hibiting a given animal, but though this is undoubtedly a parallel to the Bini customs, there is no burial ceremony connected with the forbidden animal except in rare instances. At Ijeba one quarter does not eat fowl; they are all one family and marry outside the quarter; one family does not eat goat; when they sacrifice it they clean their bands with ashes and give the meat to others. Another family, when they kill a "bush dog" (erha i. e. civet) sell it instead of eating it. The whole town of Otua forbids porcupine and a certain kind of snake (Edo, itepe). At Sabongida vultures are forbidden but not owls; there is no prohibited plant food, but they abstain from eating guinea corn for fear of spoiling their war medicine. At Afuye some forbid corn, others beans, but these bans are not hereditary. At Idua hereditary bans are known as ebale; one family forbids bush rat, sheep and plantain ; another bush rat and bush buck. There is said to be no rule of exogamy but this I was unable to test by means of genealogies; in Edo the same statement was made to me and turned out to be quite untrue. Until a wife conceives she is at liberty to eat her husband's ebale but it is prohibited to her from the time she becomes pregnant until the child is wea- ned; she may cook her own ebale for her husband. The forbidden animal is not necessarily sacrificed in burial rites; where it is the ordinary sacrificial animal, e. g. the goat, it may be killed. Some people forbid kola but may grow it. The whole town forbids leopard and vulture, the former on account of an ebo, Ogopede.</page><page sequence="8">Das Problem des Totemismus. 241 At Idegun ebale are also found; there is no rule of exogamy; they may sell or kill the ebale but not eat it, nor may a wife eat her husband's ebale. They may be used in sacrifice. The whole town forbids vulture and a big rat. The whole town of Ojalla forbids goat for their ebo Orhue. At Ama one family forbids bush rat, another erhue and another has no ebale ; they may marry a woman of the same ebale. Each family has only one and they may kill them but not eat. Koko yams are forbidden to the whole town. Hereditary, non-exogamous ebale are found at Eda. Ekbe forbids erhu ebo (Edo ebume) as the material of a cap but may use it for salt bags. Sugbenu near Irua forbids tortoise and they are never sacrificed. The whole of the Fuga country forbids boa; if a stranger kills it he must bury it with cloth and mat; they do not touch it but pass by on the other side. There are nineteen compounds in Fuga; three of these have no forbidden animal and in two other cases I failed to ascertain what it was; the remaining ones forbid roast yam; ivua, an animal like a porcupine; enie, puff adder; bush rat, a small rat (akbe); akpugo (small night bird); dog; all birds except fowl; sheep; tortoise; otokboko (kingfisher?); bush buck, and bush fowl. Those who forbid sheep may keep it but not eat it; the dog is sacrificed at burial and given to strangers; it is also sacrificed at other times and killed with a stick; people who do not forbid it come and fetch it away; those who forbid dog do not touch a dead dog with their hands nor bury it. Each compound contains one family and they are exogamous. A wife may not eat her hus- band's awa'. If a man eats his awa' unwittingly he dies; but a ceremony of purification will save him; water is brought and a tuber like yams dug up; this is scraped, put into water and palm oil and yams are added; the offender touches his mouth saying: "What a son does not know, if he eats, let it not kill him." The son of an isomi wife takes the awa' of his mother if he goes to live in her country. Ebozoa, the head chief, told me that he belonged to the compound which forbids dog, that he however forbids dog for his mother; that every one has two awa' one for his father and one for his mother. In the absence of a thoroughly competent interpreter I was unable to clear up the contradictions in the statements made to me, but it appears probable that it was a case of misunderstanding, for on a later occasion Ebozua told me that his son would forbid dog and roast yams for his father and in addition his mother's awa'. In Uzaitui every one forbids snail; they may take it to sacrifice to ututi but put it into a calabash instead of into soup when the sacrifice is over* I was told that the emagua is sometimes used in burial customs sacri- ficed or thrown away. One man forbids erhue; he may kill it but not eat it. If they find a boa they bury it in the bush, otherwise they would die; if a stranger tried to kill one they would drive him away; if a white man did so they would run away. 1 In the yam farm. Anthropoa X- XI. 1916-1916. 18</page><page sequence="9">242 N. W. Thomas, At Auci there are four families, two of which forbid erhue and the other two, boa and porcupine respectively. Forbidden animals are found in the Kukuruku parts of Northern Nigeria. At Uzukuri if a man says: "this food is rotten", they may not eat it. At Ko- minio all forbid a big snake (iniokoko boa?); the chief forbids dog; he may not catch fish but may eat it; there is a proverb: If I do that may I eat dog. In another family if a man says; "Get up, drink water" they may not drink. In one compound if a woman goes to market and someone says do her: "Buy this for your husband", she runs from the market. There are four compounds in Soso, two of which have forbidden ani- mals - leopard and chameleon; they are not exogamous. At Ibillo women forbid dog; one quarter forbids tortoise, another pig, another a big monkey and the fourth (Hausa imaba). At Ibillo and Ibie if a man says to his wife: "You eat dog", she leaves him; at Ibillo he has to pay 2/6 to her father and mother before she goes back. At Ibie she does not go back at all and the husband cannot claim repayment of the bride price. At Eferun in the Sobo country the whole town forbids snakes, cats, rats, crocodiles, lizards. A family prohibition is called isekbe; they are not sacri- ficed and a wife may eat her husband's isekbe. At Ajeyube they have the same prohibitions for the whole town, so too has Ugeli with the addition of orhua (= erhue). At Ewu bans are called aga; the whole country forbids crocodile, snake, leopard and snail. There are also family agay which they never kill, nor even allow in their houses, much less keep. Exogamy is practised and the wife does not eat her husband's aga, even when she is not in his house. Enquiry however showed that only one out of seven chiefs present could name his own aga. Okpara forbids dog, leopard, crocodile and a big black snake called ogbo. They bury them if they find them. Ijesi, chief of Kokori, forbids dog for his mother, who came from Kwale town, where all forbid them. This ban will be handed on to his sons and his wives may not eat dog in his house. Leopard is forbidden to the whole town but they may take the skin and use it. Family prohibitions (ero) are found at Jesse, among them are: dog, bush lizard, bush pig, cow, bush cow and rat. In Benin City there are certain prohibitions connected with this Ã§bo (demi-gods). Igbagon is a river, often identified with Olokun and, like Olokun, wor- shipped by women; he did not permit women to eat fish and at one time no Edo woman would touch fish; the men had to cook it in the bush; if the women had eaten it their mouths would peel; as a purification they had to take afo, wash their mouths and swear before Igbagon that they would not touch fish again. Igbagon was worshipped chiefly at Ioxe on the Sapcba road. Ogba was originally a wife of the king of Edo. She ran away to Ogomo, who went to the king to beg for her, but the king would not forgive her. She went into the back of the house and began to cry and presently turned</page><page sequence="10">Das Problem des Totemismus. 24a into water. She is now the Ogba creek. People of the royal family may not drink of the water, and if people belonging to Edo wash their clothes in it, they must dry them before they bring them back. Near Idumowina is a spring called Elowi which was once a woman. The fish are called Ivielowi and may not be killed. If we leave out of account all individual bans and also such group bans as are stated to be for the medicine or the Ã§bo (demi-god), we find among the Edo the following awaigbe: (a) patrilineal and (b) matrilineal (under special circumstances), either of which may be (1) associated or (2) not associated with burial rites ; under ordinary circumstances these families are exogamous. In certain areas, however, the families are non-exogamous and here the bans are not utilised in burial rites, so far as our information goes. Over the greater part of the area the forbidden animals are few in number; but in the Edo area proper, where the more exhausive enquiries were made, the number recorded in five villages totalling not much over 1000 inhabitants, or 200 households in all, was nearly one hundred (it must be remembered that in some cases the wives' bans were noted), so that the proportion of bans to families was high, especially as the four villages dealt with are closely connected by marriage ties, without, however, in any way forming an inter- marrying unit; in view of the work exacted from the suitor as a portion of the bride price contiguity is naturally an important element. This large number of forbidden animals taken in conjunction with the traditional splitting up of families grown too large, suggests a comparatively modern origin for most of the existing prohibitions, if not for the custom itself. This brings me to a question of terminology; it is for the moment negligible whether we regard totemism as originating all the world over in the same way, or whether, as seems probable, the term totemism, if used at all as a scientific term, implies no lineal relationship between the different customs, so far as origin is concerned, but only a certain resemblance of final type, namely the association of a certain prohibition or set of prohibitions with a social unit which distinguishes itself from its fellows by a real or assumed descent from a common ancestor, and therefore, in many cases, practice exogamy. Is this definite type of relationship to be recognised only in such cases as the relationship arose in some, as yet, undetermined way; or are we to class under the head of totemism any similar relationship, even when the association of the animal with the kinship group can be definitely traced back to a prior association of the animal with an object of worship - god or demi-god - specially associated with them? If we answer the latter question in the affirmative, it may be urged that, if this cult spreads, as religious beliefs often spread, to another area, carried thither perhaps by a woman at her marriage, the group with which the animal is associated becomes too comprehensive - it may embrace the whole tribe - and the term totemism becomes a misnomer; though the relationship of the original group to the forbidden animal has not undergone any change. In other words, where the cult is active and not passive, it may be passed on in other ways than by descent. 16*</page><page sequence="11">244 N. W. Thomas, The same objection, however, applies to true totemism - it may spread beyond the sept. It is therefore not necessary on this ground to lay down that the association between the social group and the animal must be primary or immediate. At the same time the ordinary usage seems to be to restrict the term to such cases as are prima facie immediate. Before we consider whether any facts relevant to the questions raised by the Edo customs are found among other tribes of Southern Nigeria, it may be well to glance for a moment at the political condition of the different peoples. I have unfortunately no information as to totemism among the Yorubas, beyond a vague statement that the people of Akure, with whom the Bini were at war, probably about the end of the eighteenth century, and may therefore have been more or less intimately associated in times of peace. The Yorubas are however under the sway of rulers whose power extends beyond their immediate town; and it is important to note that the emigrants from Ida, also of Yoruba speech and stock, who have settled at Ha in the Ibo country, have prohibitions of the Edo type, which are associated with their burial ceremonies, exactly as are those of the subjects of the king of Benin. Now the Ata of Ida, exactly like the Oba of Benin, ruled a wide extent of territory; we may conjecture that his subjects had considerable freedom of movement and were not confined to their own towns, as was so often the case in other parts of Nigeria, by the fear of being captured by their enemies, often the people of the adjacent towns, and sold into slavery. Now in the Edo country the various families are intermingled; in a single village of four or five hundred inhabitants it is possible to find representatives of a dozen or more families as a part of the normal resident population. How far this is the case in Ida I have no means of judging; but when the Igara migrate to Ibo territory they settle in quarters, precisely as do the Ibo themselves, which have each their own special prohibitions. In other words, Igara totemism, if such it be, is, among the Ibo, com- pletely assimilated to the Ibo system of ritual prohibitions, save that it is also associated with burial rites. On the other hand, it bears an even closer resemblance to Edo totemism, for, whereas among the Igara the prohibitions are associated with certain families and also, perhaps secondarily, with certain localities, among the Edo they are associated only with certain families; but it is clear that the fact that these families were never so grouped as to form quarters with ritual prohibitions identical for all their native inhabitants, or that, if they were once so grouped, they have now been scattered, is no reason for drawing any line of demarcation between their system of prohibitions and that of the Igara. Among the Ibo tribes, although, on the Asaba side it is normal for each town to have a head chief, usually known as obi, of considerable powers, at any rate as far as the permanent influence of the kind of Edo extended, the reverse is the case on the other side of the Niger; here not the town as a whole but each quarter is the unit and owns no authority save that of the head of the kin. Each quarter is normally an exogamous unit, as is also the</page><page sequence="12">Das Problem des Totemismus. 245 case on the Asaba side save where tradition has been deliberately interferred with and intermarriage between two closely related groups made possible by an act of the whole community - the sacrifice to the mwo or ancestors of one or more victims, and the declaration that these marriages were henceforth to be permitted. There are certain prohibitions in the Ibo area which closely resemble those which are known as awaigbe among the Edo; but they are not practised by individual families. Apparently they were not prohibited in the first place and then associated with burial rites; for they are ordinary acts of mourning in some cases; thus a wife may not rip the ornaments off her neck in a fit of rage at her husband, because this is one of the rites prescribed for widows; nor may husbands and wives remove each others pots; for this again is done in case of death. Now it is clear that a similar explanation, though it will not fit all cases of ritual prohibitions (awaigbe) among the Edo, is a far simpler and more natural explanation of such of them as are forbidden acts, than any supposition that puts them on a par with an animal or plant which stands in a mystic relation to the sept. The forbidden animals and plants on the other hand resemble far more closely the hereditary prohibitions among the Ibo, which are commonly peculiar to certain quarters, though they may be observed by a whole town where it claims descent from one man. These prohibitions are ostensibly practised in many cases in connection with the cults of the various alose, which forbid certain animals or plants, and also certain acts. In addition to these prohi- bitions, which descend normally in the male line, the mother's prohibitions and those of the ci are also observed in some places, but usually not handed on 1 to the next generation. The Ã©i is ordinarily a dead person believed to be reincarnated in a new-born child and associated with the after life of the child. My information as to anunso, forbidden animals, among the Ibo is for various reasons much less complete than that gathered among the Edo. My statistical information was not collected in the form of genealogies, the fact that whole quarters or whole towns practised the same prohibitions made it less easy to deal with the matter by this method. At the present day descent is patrilineal both in the Awka and Asaba Districts; but there are distinct traces of a time when the mother handed on her anunso to her children, though patrilineal descent was perhaps practised concurrently. The Amikwo quarter of Awka is divided into two parts, of which one without exception forbids dog; the other, Ezioka, has three families, of which the first forbids dog, while in the second only small boys may eat, in the third small boys and some women. The question of the origin of these differences is complicated by the fact that the holders of various titles forbid dog, whether it is an animal pro- hibited by their family or not. Their own explanation of the differences is 1 At Ibuzo the mother's prohibition is said to be hereditary.</page><page sequence="13">246 N. W. Thomas, that the two sub-quarters are descended from different fathers, who were them- selves half-brothers by the same father. At Nneni dog is forbidden to the sons of women who forbid it. At Agolo chief Agofugo eats monkey, though all his quarter, and con- sequently his own father, forbids it; the reason given is that he comes from the world that eats monkey, i. e. that his di is his mother's father; and that he follows the law of his cL In the Asaba District on the other hand a man commonly practises the ci prohibitions side by side with those inherited from his parents or his father. As regards the origin of the prohibitions there is often no explanation; in other cases there is the familiar aetiological myth of the animal which helped an ancestor. At Ugwoba a story is told to explain why they forbid ground-squirrel (ulili). They heard from the old people that when Ada invaded the land, their ancestors fled to another town; ulili defaced their footmarks and the Ada people said: It is long since they went. A similar story is told at Asaba to account for their prohibited animals, ekulo and leopard. At Agolo a story is told to the effect that a man was about to be seized and a monkey shouted to warn people of his family. A second explanation was also vouchsafed - that the monkey belongs to an alose. At Mbwaku they say that a doctor told them to bring nza (a small bird) and did magic with it for them; thenceforth they respected it. As regards the treatment of forbidden animals, the Amikwo quarter which forbids dog, will not kill it and will not eat it; they allow it to wander about the quarter at will and do not bury it if they find it dead. An Amikwo woman who has married into another quarter will not cook dog for her husband. A wife may apparently eat dog in an Amikwo husband's house, unless she is suckling a child; but she may not use her cooking pot for her husband's food, if dog has been cooked in it. In another quarter a wife may eat dog but her husband may not see her do so. The Ezioka quarter forbids leopard and all snakes; but they may wear the leopard's skin, and kill snakes for use in medicine. Some of the Amenyi families buy dogs and keep them but do not eat them; here, however, a wife may not eat dog. One family of Umuwere forbids cassava, so far as adult males are con- cerned; but their wives and daughters may plant and eat. A pregnant wife may continue to eat till she is seized with nausea; this is a sign that the child will be a boy; if, however, she continues to eat, nothing is done; it is her own palaver. This prohibition is apparently connected with titles, though my notes do not mention it, for otherwise there is no explanation of the fact that the prohibition is confined to males. Both at Agolo and elsewhere it is a common rule that the python may not be killed on house land, though it may be ruthlessly destroyed on the farm. Adaji forbids fish and eats them. Nneni, their immediate neighbours, do not eat them; for they have no water near, and eating fresh fish would cause their bodies to swell. Obu forbids leopard but may sell the skin. A pregnant or suckling wife does not eat her husband's forbidden animal.</page><page sequence="14">Das Problem des TotemismiÂ». 247 At Nise monkeys are eaten but not killed. Rats, locusts and possibly other small game, are eaten by women only; but this does not appear to be a matter of religious scruple. If a python is found in a house, four seed yams are tied together and given to the snake after it has been carried out with a stick; the yams are put on it and it is told to carry them to Ocici, the alose that owns it. At Nofia most kinds of snakes may be killed but not eaten ; the python, however, may not be killed. At Okpanam if they find a dead ram, they put it on a broken tin and carry it to the bush (a joifia)' the bearer has to wash, change his cloth and perform a ceremony of purification with a chicken. At Ani ofo a man who has eaten civet cat may not salute a man who forbids it till seven days have passed. If a man who forbids it catches it in a trap unintentionally, he brings it back to the town and buries it mourning for seven days thereafter. There is practi cally no trace of an exogamic rule in connection with forbidden animals; where a marriage is forbidden, it is on the ground that the parties belong to the same family; but the possession of the same anunso is not held to demonstrate this relationship. In some places it is stated that these prohibitions for an alose, which are quite distinct from those imposed on individuals by a doctor, are observed by a man who has for a time resided in the town and subsequently removed elsewhere. A fortiori therefore would they be incumbent on a native who re- moved elsewhere. In the Edo country Ã§bo (= alose) are everywhere found and appear to be rather the property of individual families than of quarters or towns; that is to say, it by no means follows that all the inhabitants of a particular village will have the same prohibitions. Now the number of ebo in the Edo country is considerable; even if it is not so great as the number of awaigbe. If therefore certain ebo were ori- ginally associated with certain families or certain areas, restricted, at least in the main, to descendants of a single ancestor, the dispersion of such families might well lead to the retention of the awaigbe when the special association with the Ã§bo was forgotten; for a cult kept up by individual families would necessarily be less important than one kept up by the inhabitants of a con- siderable area. Again, if certain acts are prohibited in ordinary life because they are primarily associated with burial ceremonies, a somewhat analogous course of reasoning may lead to the employment in burial ceremonies of things forbidden, either for an ebo or otherwise, in ordinary life. If the animals, hy- pothetically associated with the ebo, were also employed in burial ceremonies, this would tend to keep alive the remembrance of the awaigbe, for nothing is more persistent than burial ritual, even though the ebo, the primary cause of the probition, fell into disrepute of forgetfulness. Now nothing is more certain than that cults have their day and die out or fall into the background; the rise of a new cult is nothing out of the way in West Africa; and the spread of an old established cult is, at any rate in the present day, as my notebooks show, equally common.</page><page sequence="15">248 Fr. Graebner, There is therefore nothing impossible in the supposition that the Edo awaigbe, which possible, as already pointed out, have a double or multiple origin, are not primary in their origin and therefore not properly to be termed totemistic. In favour of some such supposition tells the fact that whereas some Ibo towns know that they practise their nso (prohibitions) for an alose, others know their simply as prohibitions, though there is no reason whatever to suppose that the origin of the two sets of nso has been diverse. There is, however, another possibility to be reckoned with as an expla- nation of the Edo awaigbe. We have seen that there are similar customs in a part of the Yoruba area; and Yoruba influence is strong in the Edo country, not only on account of the contiguity of the areas, but also because the kings of Edo were undoubtedly of Yoruba stock, and, if they did not bring many people of Yoruba blood with them, certainly attracted them in subsequent times. If the association of forbidden animals with burial rites is a Yoruba custom, it may well have been adopted in the Edo country in imitation of the immi- grants; and this would explain the large number of awaigbe, which is, however, as we have seen to some extent parallelled by the town of Fuga, though here Yoruba influence is unlikely. It is sufficiently clear that the Edo customs are distinctly aberrant; a special explanation is therefore more probable than one of general application, such as may be needed to explain the various forms of totemism elsewhere in Africa and in other parts of the world. Even if one of the explanations suggested above be the true one, the Edo awaigbe differ so widely from the ordinary totemic prohibition that the probability of a multiple origin for the latter is not materially increased. The Ibo nso however, apart from their occasional association with an alose, present a far more familiar appearance. It may of course be argued that the association of forbidden animals with an alose is due to the fact that they were originally totems; but this is mere guesswork and, in view of the large number of other ritual prohibitions in the Ibo country, unlikely. Such an ex- planation of quasi-totemic phenomena would only apply where analogous con- ditions are found. This would exclude the areas in which totemism is found in its most characteristic forms. But the first step to an advance in our know- ledge of totemism is the exclusion of phenomena of secondary origin, even though we may eventually agree to call them totemic. 9. Totemismus als kulturgeschichtliches Problem. Von Fr. Graebner, KÃ¶ln. Die berechtigten Definitionen des Totemismus dÃ¼rften sich zwischen zwei Ã¤uÃersten Punkten bewegen: 1. Totemismus ist ein sozial -religiÃ¶ser Vorstellungs- und Verhaltungs- komplex, demzufolge exogame gesellschaftliche Gruppen sich zu je einer oder mehreren Objektarten, besonders Arten von Naturobjekten, in besonderem nÃ¤heren, in TÃ¶tungs- oder Gebrauchsverboten zum Ausdrucke kommenden VerhÃ¤ltnisse stehend denken.</page><page sequence="16">Das Problem des Totemismus. 249 2. Totemismus ist ein religiÃ¶ser oder halbreligiÃ¶ser Vorstellungskreis, demzufolge die verschiedenen Einzelglieder oder Untergruppen einer Gemein- schaft zu verschiedenen Objekten in besonderem nÃ¤heren VerhÃ¤ltnisse gedacht werden, jedoch nicht im Sinne einer eigentlichen kultischen Verehrung des Objektes. Als erschÃ¶pfende Unterabteilungen des Totemismus in der letztaufgeftihrten weiteren Begrenzung ergeben sich, je nachdem die Beziehung zum Totemobjekt am Individuum, am Geschlecht oder an Gruppen gemischten Geschlechtes haftet, der Individualtotemismus, der Geschlechtstotemismus und der Gruppen- totemismus. Besondere Formen des letzten kÃ¶nnen durch die Bezeichnungen Lokaltotemismus, Sippentotemismus und andere Ã¤hnlich gebildete Worte unter- schieden werden, sÃ¤mtlich Begriffe, die innerhalb der allgemeinen Definition einer besonderen Charakterisierung auÃer der in ihren Namen liegenden nicht bedÃ¼rfen. Diese MÃ¶glichkeit logisch einwandfreier Gliederung und die Tatsache, daÃ sie die gesamten, dem Problem des Totemismus zugrundeliegenden Er- scheinungen umfaÃt, verleiht der oben an zweiter Stelle stehenden weiteren Definition groÃe praktische Brauchbarkeit, zumal die Begriffe des Sexual- und Individualtotemismus bereits Heimatsberechtigung in der Wissenschaft erlangt haben. Was dieser Definition dagegen fehlt, ist die historisch -linguistische Berechtigung. Diese wÃ¤re auf Seiten einer Definition, die sich auf den Boden der bei den AlgonkinstÃ¤mmen herrschenden VerhÃ¤ltnisse stellte und das Wort auf den Gruppentotemismus beschrÃ¤nkte. Leider kommen wir auf diesem Wege jedoch nicht zu einer eindeutigen Abgrenzung des Begriffes, da die genaue Festlegung auf den Tatbestand bei den AlgonkinstÃ¤mmen eben nur die Ab- steckung eines ganz speziellen Tatbestandes, aber keinen in der allgemeineren ethnologischen Terminologie verwendbaren Begriff ergeben wÃ¼rde. Sowie aber eine Anpassung des Begriffes an allgemeinere BedÃ¼rfnisse als notwendig an- erkannt wird, ergeben sich wieder die verschiedenartigen MÃ¶glichkeiten: Es bleibt unsicher, ob Speise- und TÃ¶tungsverbote, ob die Vorstellung der Ab- stammung vom Totemobjekt als integrierende Bestandteile anzusehen seien, ja, ob man unter Totemismus nur die sozusagen religiÃ¶se Seite der Sache oder den ganzen religiÃ¶s-sozialen Erscheinungskreis befassen solle. Rein begrifflich genommen, steht in der ganzen Frage so sehr Recht gegen Recht, daÃ kaum eine der verschiedenen mÃ¶glichen Abgrenzungen Aussicht auf allgemeinere Anerkennung haben dÃ¼rfte. Jede Entscheidung wÃ¤re ja im Grunde genommen beim heutigen Stande der Forschung auch rein willkÃ¼rlich. Besonders was die Einzelheiten anbetrifft, ist die Frage, welche Erscheinungen integrierende Bestandteile des totemistischen Komplexes sind, welche nicht, schlieÃlich identisch mit der anderen, welche Erscheinungen dem Komplexe ursprÃ¼nglich angehÃ¶rt, welche sich sekundÃ¤r mit ihm verbunden haben. Und Ã¤hnlich wird die Entscheidung, ob die Bezeichnung Individual- totemismus zu Recht besteht, d. h. ob die damit benannte Erscheinungsgruppe zum Totemismus zu rechnen sei oder nicht, vermutlich durch die Feststellung gegeben werden, ob Individual- und Gruppentotemismus genetisch zusammen- hÃ¤ngen oder nicht. Das will sagen, daÃ in diesem Falle wenigstens die end- gÃ¼ltige Fixierung der Begriffe die LÃ¶sung des ganzen totemistischen ProblÃ¨mes</page><page sequence="17">250 Fr. Graebner, voraussetzt. Bis auf weiteres werden wir zufrieden sein dÃ¼rfen, wenn jeder Einzelne, der Ã¼ber den Gegenstand handelt, die Bezeichnungen, die er an- wendet, eindeutig gebraucht, nicht SchlÃ¼sse, die fÃ¼r eine Form oder Teil- erscheinung zutreffen, ohne BegrÃ¼ndung auf andere Ã¼bertrÃ¤gt, vor allem aber die Einzelerscheinungen nicht rein begrifflicher Gleichheit wegen mit Ã¤hn- lichen Erscheinungen anderer Tatsachengruppen, etwa Speiseverbot mit Speise- verbot, totemistisches VerhÃ¤ltnis zu Tieren mit Tierverehrung, zusammen- flieÃen lÃ¤Ãt. Die sachlichen Fragen, um die es sich beim Totemismus im weiteren Sinne vor allem handelt, ob die verschiedenen Formen genetisch zusammenhÃ¤ngen oder nicht, welches die ursprÃ¼ngliche Gestalt, sowie im AnschluÃ daran, welches der ursprÃ¼ngliche Sinn und die Ursachen des Erscheinungskomplexes oder der Komplexe gewesen seien, haben nahezu so viel Beantwortungen gefunden, als sich Forscher mit dem Gegenstande beschÃ¤ftigt haben. Jeder hat, je nach dem Ausgangspunkte seiner Untersuchung, nach dem Umfange und der Gestalt, in der ihm der Totemismus von diesem Gesichtspunkte aus erschien, nach einer Auffassung gesucht, die alle Tatsachen so restlos wie mÃ¶glich zu er- klÃ¤ren geeignet war. Der eingeschlagene Weg ist also der der Hypothese. Die maÃgebende Bedeutung des Ausgangspunktes der Untersuchung, bis zu einem gewissen Grade also die suggestive Wirkung der Begriffsbestimmung, die der Forscher in die Untersuchung hineinbringt, zeigt sich z. B. deutlich bei den Amerika- nisten. Die in Amerika und nur dort enge Verbindung von Gruppen- und Individualtotemismus liegt. Hill-Tout's Theorie von der Entstehung des ersteren aus dem letzteren zugrunde. Und auch Goldenweiser's destruktive Analyse hÃ¤tte mindestens nicht so radikal ausfallen kÃ¶nnen, wenn ihm nicht die Bedeutung des Totems als Kunstmotiv und Wappenzeichen gleichwertig neben andere Bestandteile des Komplexes getreten wÃ¤re. Immerhin ist Goldenweiser's Stellungnahme eine gewisse natÃ¼rliche Reaktion gegen die bisherige Behand- lung des Problems, die bei aller Ungleichwertigkeit der Theorien - nicht alle hauen die gordischen Knoten so gewaltsam durch wie die von A. Lang - doch keine von tiberzeugender Kraft gezeitigt hat. Goldenweiser faÃt aber doch die Ursachen der Erfolglosigkeit nicht tief genug ; er sucht sie im Objekt, wÃ¤hrend sie in Wirklichkeit vermutlich in der Art der Behandlung liegen, in der Methode. Bei hypothetischen Aufstellungen sind subjektive Auffassungen Ã¼ber das, was naturgemÃ¤Ã, psychologisch wahrscheinlich, primitiv usw., nicht auszuschalten; ja sie spielen notwendig eine maÃgebende Rolle. Um sie in ihren Schranken zu halten, bedarf es gewisser objektiver Kriterien, die min- destens einen Teil der gedanklich mÃ¶glichen Kombinationen ausschlieÃen. Solche Kriterien gibt die kulturgeschichtliche Methode, indem sie vielfach zu entscheiden gestattet, welche Form einer Erscheinungsgruppe Ã¤lter, welche jÃ¼nger ist, welche Erscheinungen derselben Kulturgruppe oder verwandten Gruppen angehÃ¶ren und deshalb in genetische Beziehungen zueinander gesetzt werden kÃ¶nnen, welche nicht. Gerade um Fragen solcher Art handelt es sich beim totemistischen Problem. GehÃ¶ren die einzelnen Formen des Totemismus, vor allem Gruppen- und Individualtotemismus, einer gemeinsamen, gut cha-</page><page sequence="18">Das Problem des Totemismus. 251 rakterisierten Kulturgruppe oder wenigstens Kulturgruppen an, die nahe mit- einander verwandt sind? Wenn ja, ist der Individualtotemismus in einer Form, aus der der Gruppentotemismus hervorgehen konnte, Ã¤lter als dieser oder etwa umgekehrt? Welche Form der Gruppentotemismen ist die Ã¤lteste, die also bei der Frage des Ursprunges zugrunde gelegt werden mÃ¼Ãte? Sind wenigstens die Einzelformen des Totemismus Ã¼berhaupt kulturell einheitliche Gebilde? Oder gehÃ¶ren etwa die Bestandteile des Gruppentotemismus, z. B. Beziehung zum Totemobjekt und Exogamie, verschiedenen Kulturgruppen an und zeigen nur, wie Goldenweiser will, beim Zusammentreffen besonders groÃe Neigung zum Verschmelzen? Genauer verfolgt habe ich bisher die VerhÃ¤ltnisse in der SÃ¼dsee und habe dabei Ã¼ber die kulturgeschichtliche Stellung des Gruppentotemismus wichtige Ergebnisse gewonnen. Eine bestimmte Form, der vaterrechtlich exogame Lokaltotemismus, hat sich als charakteristischer Bestandteil einer ganz bestimmten Kultur erwiesen, die nach ihm als totemistische Kultur be- zeichnet wurde. Alle anderen Formen, insbesondere mutterrechtliche Formen des Totemismus sowie Ã¼berhaupt Ãbergangserscheinungen zwischen dem vater- rechtlichen Lokaltotemismus und nichttotemistischen mutterrechtlichen Heirats- systemen, finden sich nur dort, wo sich totemistische Kultur mit anderen Kulturgruppen, vor allem der des mutterrechtlichen Zweiklassensystems, ge- mischt und berÃ¼hrt hat. Sie sind deshalb, zunÃ¤chst in der SÃ¼dsee, als sekundÃ¤re Bildungen, meist als Kombinationserscheinungen anzusehen. Die einzige ur- sprÃ¼ngliche, aber auch in ihrer ganzen sozial-religiÃ¶sen Zusammensetzung zweifellos ursprÃ¼ngliche Form des Gruppentotemismus ist eben der vater- rechtlich exogame Lokaltotemismus. Wesentlich ist noch, daÃ innerhalb der totemistischen Kultur in der SÃ¼dsee Altersverschiedenheiten, gewissermaÃen Schichtungen, nachweisbar sind, und daÃ diesen Unterschieden auch solche des Totemismus selbst entsprechen. In der Ã¤ltesten Schicht der Kultur herrscht so gut wie ausschlieÃlich der Tiertotemismus, der also, zunÃ¤chst nach MaÃgabe der SÃ¼dseeverhÃ¤ltnisse, als Ã¤lteste Form zu gelten hÃ¤tte; jÃ¼nger erscheint der Pflanzentotemismus, am jÃ¼ngsten das System des kombinierten Totems, bei dem jede Gruppe mehrere Totemobjekte verschiedener Gattung besitzt. Weniger einfach, aber doch ziemlich klar liegen die VerhÃ¤ltnisse in Afrika. Auch hier lÃ¤Ãt sich eine Kultur nachweisen, die, obwohl weniger kompakt verbreitet, in ihrer Zusammensetzung dem totemistischen Komplexe der SÃ¼dsee entspricht. Zu ihrem BestÃ¤nde gehÃ¶rt auch der Gruppentotemismus selbst, und zwar erscheint als ursprÃ¼nglich wieder der meist mit Exogamie - bei den Betschuanen ist sie nicht belegt - verbundene vaterrechtliche Lokaltotemis- mus, wÃ¤hrend die mutterrechtlichen Formen und sonstigen ÃbergÃ¤nge des Systems im EinfluÃbereiche der mutterrechtlichen westafrikanischen Kultur liegen, augenscheinlich auch hier Kontakterscheinungen darstellen. Wie Austra- lien in seinen Vier- und Achtklassensystemen, so hat auch Afrika seine be- sonders charakteristischen Formen des Mischsystems, und zwar erscheint der mutterrechtliche EinfluÃ in der typischen afrikanischen Mischform oberflÃ¤ch- licher als in der australischen. Denn nicht das ganze System ist mutterrechtlich abgewandelt, sondern es ist eine Spaltung der Funktionen eingetreten. Nur</page><page sequence="19">252 Fr. Graebner, die soziale, eheregelnde Seite des Totemismus ist mutterrechtlich geworden, die religiÃ¶se vaterrechtlich geblieben, ein Doppelsystem, wie es sich von den Hereros im SÃ¼den bis Oberguinea ziemlich verbreitet findet. Soweit wÃ¼rden die afrikanischen VerhÃ¤ltnisse denen der SÃ¼dsee ziemlich genau entsprechen. Die Komplizierung liegt darin, daÃ, wie andere Elemente totemistischer Kultur- zugehÃ¶rigkeit (z. B. KegeldachhÃ¼tte), auch der Totemismus offensichtlich eine sekundÃ¤re Verbreitung gefunden hat durch die HirtenvÃ¶lker, eine sekundÃ¤re Verbreitung, der er besonders sein Vorhandensein in Ostafrika zum groÃen Teile verdankt. Und zwar weist das System in diesem jÃ¼ngeren Verbreitungs- gebiete nun auch besondere EigentÃ¼mlichkeiten auf: nicht nur die âsplit totems", d. h. die EigentÃ¼mlichkeit, daÃ Teile von Tieren, auch Spielarten, vor allem von Rindern, als Totems auftreten, sondern auch auf der sozialen Seite das Nebeneinander, Ã¶fters die systematische Verbindung der exogamen Gliederung mit einer endogamen, etwa der Art, daÃ die exogamen Gruppen als Unterabteilungen von endogamen auftreten. Besonders die letzterwÃ¤hnte Erscheinung ist aber keine spezifisch afrikanische, sondern findet sich in Vorderindien wieder. Wenn es dadurch wahrscheinlich wird, daÃ die afrika- nischen HirtenvÃ¶lker diese Einrichtung und somit auch einen Gruppentote- mismus Ã¼berhaupt schon bei ihrer Einwanderung in Afrika mitgebracht haben, wenn sich ferner Totemismus und Exogamie gerade auch bei innerasiatischen HirtenvÃ¶lkern findet, wenn endlich die erwÃ¤hnte Verbindung von Endo- und Exogamie in Vorderindien auch gerade bei dem Hauptrest alter HirtenvÃ¶lker, den Toda, freilich ohne Totemismus, vorhanden ist, so dÃ¼rfen wir mit einiger Wahrscheinlichkeit schlieÃen, daÃ die ganze in Rede stehende Gruppe sozialer Erscheinungen in der Kulturfamilie der typischen ViehzÃ¼chter heimatberechtigt ist und sich mit den Gliedern dieser Familie verbreitet hat. Wir hÃ¤tten somit Gruppentotemismus, und zwar vaterrechtlich exogamen Gruppentotemismus, nicht nur in den Ã¤lteren totemistischen Kulturkomplexen der SÃ¼dsee und Afrikas, sondern auch in den vermutlich von Innerasien ausgegangenen Vieh- zÃ¼chterkulturen. Die Kulturstellung des Gruppentotemismus in SÃ¼damerika fÃ¼gt sich, so- weit das bisher zu Ã¼bersehen ist, dem aus der SÃ¼dsee und Afrika gewonnenen Bilde ein. Er gehÃ¶rt einer Ã¤lteren Zone an, die auch sonst wieder Analoga des entsprechenden SÃ¼dseekomplexes enthÃ¤lt. Und wieder weisen die von jÃ¼ngerer Kultur weniger beeinfluÃten Teile der Zone vaterrechtlich exogamen Lokaltotemismus auf. Nur Nordamerika scheint andere VerhÃ¤ltnisse zu bieten. Einen in seiner Verbreitung mehr oder weniger geschlossenen, mit den entsprechenden Kom- plexen anderer Erdteile Ã¼bereinstimmenden totemistischen Kulturkomplex gibt es in Nordamerika nicht. Der Gruppentotemismus schlieÃt sich zwar auch hier einer bestimmten Kulturschicht an, aber es ist das gerade die der mutter- rechtlichen Kulturen; formell zeigt der Gruppentotemismus Ã¼brigens inner- halb dieser nordamerikanischen Schicht besondere Einheitlichkeit in dem weitverbreiteten, wohl auf Einwirkung des Individualtotemismus zurÃ¼ckgehenden ausschlieÃlichen Anrechte der Totemgruppe auf bestimmte Namen und Ab- zeichen, das ihm. in Nordwestamerika durch Ãberwuchern seinen bestimmten</page><page sequence="20">Das Problem des Totemismus. 253 Charakter verliehen hat. Bei nÃ¤herem Zusehen wird die ursprÃ¼ngliche Zuge- hÃ¶rigkeit zur mutterrechtlichen Kulturschicht doch auch in Nordamerika zweifelhaft. In Nordwestamerika, wo Boas das Ãbergreifen der mutterrecht- lichen nÃ¶rdlichen Kulturgruppe Ã¼ber die ursprÃ¼nglich vaterrechtliche SÃ¼dgruppe studiert hat, scheint doch eine vaterrechtliche Lokalorganisation Ã¼berhaupt das FrÃ¼here zu sein. Und ebenso dÃ¼rfte der vaterrechtliche Gruppentotemismus der Algonkin- und einiger PrÃ¤riestÃ¤mme mit Ã¶rtlicher Sonderung der Totem- gruppen im Lagerkreise kaum ein Produkt der Entlehnung von den mutter- rechtlichen Bodenbaukulturen sein, sondern einer Ã¤lteren Kulturschicht an- gehÃ¶ren, als es diese mutterrechtlichen Kulturen sind. So fehlt es also auch hier nicht an Zeichen von der PrioritÃ¤t des vaterrechtlichen Lokaltotemismus, ohne daÃ wir jedoch bisher die genauere KulturzugehÃ¶rigkeit dieser Form in Nordamerika festzustellen vermÃ¶chten. Gruppentotemismus, und zwar vaterrechtlich exogamer Gruppentotemis- mus, ist also vorhanden in einer Kulturgruppe, die in der SÃ¼dsee, Afrika und SÃ¼damerika gleichmÃ¤Ãig auftritt, in der Kultur der HirtenvÃ¶lker und in Nord- amerika, hier in noch nicht fixierbarer Kulturstellung. Da die ViehzÃ¼chter- kulturen mit den Ã¤lteren totemistischen verwandt sind - sie nehmen eine Ãbergangsstellung ein zwischen diesen und den jÃ¼ngeren vaterrechtlichen vom Typ der polynesischen und indogermanischen Kultur - , so bleibt das nord- amerikanische Vorkommen des Totemismus vorlÃ¤ufig auÃerhalb des nachweis- baren genetischen Zusammenhanges. Als Ã¤lteste Form darf innerhalb dieses Zusammenhanges wie wahrscheinlich auch in Nordamerika der Lokaltotemismus gelten ; und ebenso wird die aus den SÃ¼dseeverhÃ¤ltnissen erschlossene PrioritÃ¤t des Tiertotemismus durch die Tatsachen der anderen Erdteile im allgemeinen bestÃ¤tigt. Vermag die kulturgeschichtliche Betrachtung so Ã¼ber den Gruppentote- mismus eine fÃ¼r den Anfang immerhin schon recht gute Orientierung zu schaffen, so lÃ¤Ãt sich dasselbe hinsichtlich des Individualtotemismus noch nicht sagen. Die Hauptverbreitung und Hauptentfaltung hat er in Nordamerika gefunden, dessen Kulturschichtung bei ihrer augenscheinlichen Kompliziertheit noch am wenigsten untersucht und wo ja deshalb die Stellung des Gruppen- totemismus noch am zweifelhaftesten ist. Die Verbreitung des Individual- und Gruppentotemismus deckt sich in Nordamerika in hohem Grade. Besonders der Gruppentotemismus hat fast Ã¼berall den Individualtotemismus neben sich oder ist von ihm durchdrungen und umgestaltet wie in Nordwestamerika. Dagegen scheint der Individualtotemismus hÃ¤ufiger ohne den Gruppentote- mismus vorzukommen, wie er denn auch weit nach SÃ¼den, Ã¼ber Mittelamerika hinweg, verbreitet ist, wo vom Gruppentotemismus hÃ¶chstens Spuren erhalten sind. In Afrika findet sich der Individualtotemismus zerstreut in der gleichen Zone des SÃ¼dsudans und Oberguineas wie der Gruppentotemismus. Auch sein Verbreitungsgebiet in der SÃ¼dsee liegt innerhalb der Grenzen totemistischen Kulturbereiches, aber freilich in dessen Ã¤uÃerstem SÃ¼den: abgesehen von einigen FÃ¤llen auf den Neuen Hebriden, ist er hauptsÃ¤chlich aus SÃ¼dost- australien belegt, und als wichtiger Einschlag tritt er in der zentralaustrali- schen Mischform des Totemismus auf. Das ist ein Vorkommen, das, wenn</page><page sequence="21">254 Pr. Graebner, schon noch innerhalb der Verbreitung totemistischer Kultur liegend, doch eigentlich charakteristisch ist fÃ¼r einen Ã¤lteren, den altaustralischen Kultur- komplex. Nimmt man dazu die erwÃ¤hnte amerikanische Differenz in der Ver- breitung der beiden Formen des Totemismus - auch die afrikanische Zone, der die wenigen dortigen Zeugnisse von Individualtotemismus angehÃ¶ren, enthÃ¤lt auÃer den Bestandteilen totemistischer Kultur solche Ã¤lteren Datums -, so wird die ZugehÃ¶rigkeit des Individualtotemismus zur totemistischen Kultur- gruppe, also die kulturelle ZusammengehÃ¶rigkeit mit dem Gruppentotemismus, Ã¼beraus zweifelhaft. Und dieser Zweifel wird erhÃ¶ht durch einen wichtigen inneren Unterschied : mit dem individuellen Totem verbindet sich in allen drei erwÃ¤hnten Vorkommensgebieten die Vorstellung vom alter ego, eine Vor- stellung, die dem Gruppentotemismus im ganzen vÃ¶llig abgeht, abgesehen von ausgesprochenen Mischformen, sich nur ganz selten - so am Cross-River in Westafrika - bei ihm vorfindet. Ãhnlich wie beim Individualtotemismus liegt die Frage der Kulturstellung beim Geschlechtstotemismus, dem der Alter-ego-Gedanke wenigstens teilweise ebenfalls anhaftet. Auch er, auÃerhalb Australiens nur ganz selten belegt, ist dort in der Hauptsache aus dem SÃ¼dosten bekannt. Eine Organisation und Entgegensetzung der beiden Geschlechter, wie er sie darstellt, findet sich aller- dings, jedoch ohne bisher bekannte totemistische Fassung, in anderen tote- mistischen Gebieten der SÃ¼dsee. Doch verbietet die erwÃ¤hnte, ausgesprochen sÃ¼daustralische Hauptverbreitung auch hier nach dem heutigen Stande unserer Kenntnis die sichere Zuweisung zum eigentlichen totemistischen Kulturkomplex. Zu einem wohl auch fÃ¼r den Geschlechtstotemismus entscheidenden Urteile Ã¼ber die Kulturstellung des Individualtotemismus bedarf es in erster Linie der genaueren Erforschung amerikanischer Kulturschichtung. Wichtig wÃ¤re auch eine Untersuchung Ã¼ber die KulturzugehÃ¶rigkeit der Alter-ego- Vorstellung, die unter anderen bei den HirtenvÃ¶lkern ziemlich verbreitet zu sein scheint. Eines lÃ¤Ãt sich doch schon mit einiger Wahrscheinlichkeit sagen: der Individualtotemismus gehÃ¶rt entweder der gleichen Kultur an wie der Gruppen- totemismus, und zwar dann nach dem australischen Befunde ihrer Ã¤ltesten Schicht, oder einem noch Ã¤lteren Komplex. Damit wÃ¤re also der Zeitfolge nach wohl die MÃ¶glichkeit gegeben, daÃ der Gruppentotemismus aus dem Individualtotemismus hervorgegangen sein kÃ¶nnte. Dagegen ist jedoch zunÃ¤chst zu sagen, daÃ den Ã¤ltesten Formen des Gruppentotemismus eine so charakte- ristische Teilerscheinung des Individualtotemismus wie die Alter-ego-ldee fehlt. Aber der Individualtotemismus hat auch eine weitere EigentÃ¼mlichkeit: daÃ ein individuelles Totem von den weitaus meisten - auch durchaus nicht von allen - Mitgliedern der Gemeinschaft ohne fremde Hilfe, also gewissermaÃen aus eigenem Rechte erworben wird, scheint eine besondere amerikanische Aus- bildungsform der Sache zu sein. Der ursprÃ¼ngliche Zustand, der sich selbst in den amerikanischen VerhÃ¤ltnissen noch deutlich spiegelt, scheint der gewesen zu sein, daÃ nur die Zauberer ein Individualtotem besaÃen, andere es, und zwar meist gelegentlich der Initiation, nur durch ihre Vermittlung gewinnen konnten. Nun ist aber der Gruppentotemismus, wie uns die kulturgeschichtliche Betrachtung gelehrt hat, in seiner Ã¤ltesten Form ausgeprÃ¤gt, allgemeiner,</page><page sequence="22">Das Problem des Totemismus. 555 erblicher Lokaltotemismus. Es leuchtet ein, daÃ die beiden Erscheinungs- formen, die bei vorausgesetztem Hervorgehen der einen aus der anderen die einander nÃ¤chststehenden Phasen der Entwicklung darstellen mÃ¼Ãten, sich vielmehr so ziemlich als entgegengesetzte Extreme gegenÃ¼berstehen. Eine Ent- stehung des Gruppentotemismus aus dem Individualtotemismus ist demnach von diesem Gesichtspunkte aus mindestens unwahrscheinlich. Wenn der Individualtotemismus dem eigentlichen totemistischen Kultur- komplex angehÃ¶rte, der Gruppentotemismus auch in dessen Ã¤ltesten Schichten bereits voll ausgebildet auftritt, so ergÃ¤be sich umgekehrt die MÃ¶glichkeit, daÃ der Individualtotemismus eine Spezialisierung des Gruppentotemismus, etwa eine Totemisierung des Alter-ego-Gedankens wÃ¤re. Ist der Individualtotemismus nicht in irgendeiner Form die Wurzel des Gruppentotemismus, so ist eine andere Quelle fÃ¼r diesen freilich zunÃ¤chst nicht ersichtlich. Es darf aber gefragt werden, ob eine solche Quelle Ã¼ber- haupt notwendig da sein muÃ, ob der Gruppentotemismus in der Gestalt, die ich als die Ã¤lteste ansprechen zu dÃ¼rfen glaube, nicht ein primÃ¤res, ein Anfangs- gebilde der Kultur sein kann. Wichtig ist fÃ¼r diesen Punkt die Art, wie der Bezug des Menschen zu seinem Totemobjekt, ursprÃ¼nglich meist einem Tiere, vorgestellt wird. Diese Vorstellung ist sehr variabel, genealogisch, monistisch, oft aber ganz farblos; das Totem wird als Freund, Verwandter usw. angesehen. Und da diese farblose Auffassung gerade in den Ã¤ltesten Formen besonders hÃ¤ufig ist, auÃerdem als neutral gerade die verschiedensten Spezialisierungen zulÃ¤Ãt, darf sie wohl mit ziemlichem Recht als die ursprÃ¼ngliche gelten. Es ist, um einen prÃ¤gnanten Ausdruck zu gebrauchen, ein GefÃ¼hl der Kamerad- schaft. Und es ist eine Lokalgruppe, es sind die Bewohner eines bestimmten Landstriches, die fÃ¼r eine Art von Tieren ein kameradschaftliches GefÃ¼hl em- pfinden. Weiter fÃ¼hrt uns, soviel ich sehe, keine mÃ¶gliche Auffassung vom Ursprung des Gruppentotemismus an der Voraussetzung vorbei, daÃ im Ur- sprungsgebiete die jeweiligen Totemtiere mit den entsprechenden Menschen- gruppen in einem irgendwie nÃ¤heren Kontakt gestanden haben mÃ¼ssen. Wenn dem aber so ist, bedarf dann das dem Totemismus zugrundeliegende Kamerad- schaftsgefÃ¼hl noch einer besonderen ErklÃ¤rung? Es trifft nicht zu, daÃ der primitive Mensch tierische Siedlungsgenossen einfach nur als bequemste Beute betrachtet. Im Gegenteil entspricht es, wie wir aus individuellen FÃ¤llen genugsam wissen, seiner Denkart durchaus, einer seinem unwissenschaftlichen Denken unerklÃ¤rlichen Gemeinschaft eine besondere Bedeutung beizulegen. Freilich wird man sagen: Solche Anschauungsweise ist aber nicht auf eine bestimmte Kultur beschrÃ¤nkt; warum hat sie sich gerade in einer bestimmten Kulturgruppe zu einer festen Institution ausgebildet? Nun, zu einer allgemeinen und festen Institution konnte sie naturgemÃ¤Ã nur da werden, wo eine grÃ¶Ãere Anzahl solcher BevÃ¶lkerungsgruppen zu einem in festen Wechsel- beziehungen stehenden gesellschaftlichen System zusammenwuchs. Solche wechselseitige Beziehungen lieferte dem Kulturkreis, in dem der Gruppentote- mismus groÃ wurde, die Exogamie, und deshalb ist die kulturgeschichtliche Feststellung wichtig, daÃ der Ã¤lteste nachweisbare Gruppentotemismus bereits exogam war.</page><page sequence="23">256 A. A. Goldenweiser, Die Frage nach dem Ursprung der Exogamie bedarf natÃ¼rlich ihrerseits wieder einer besonderen Untersuchung. Recht scheint mir Westermark damit zu haben, daÃ exogame Tendenzen, zunÃ¤chst auf die Wohngenossen beschrÃ¤nkt, eine weit verbreitete Erscheinung sind. In verschiedenen Kulturen nimmt die Tendenz dann verschiedene feste Formen an. Sehr alt, wohl schon der alt- australischen Kultur angehÃ¶rig, ist die GewÃ¶hnung, Ehen zwischen Kindern von Bruder und Schwester als normal anzusehen; diese sind ja normalerweise keine Wohngenossen. Ist die exogame Tendenz hier positiv ausgestaltet, so wÃ¤re sie in der totemistischen Kultur negativ geblieben, hÃ¤tte auch ihren ursprÃ¼nglichen Lokalcharakter beibehalten, ihn jedoch auf die Siedlungsgruppen erweitert. SelbstverstÃ¤ndlich kann dabei, wie die Exogamie zur Fixierung des Totemgedankens, so dieser zur Fixierung der Exogamie auf die Totemgruppen beigetragen haben. All das sind jedoch beim heutigen Stand der Dinge noch in hohem Grade MÃ¶glichkeiten. GrÃ¶Ãere oder geringere GewiÃheit wird nur die Fort- setzung der kulturgeschichtlichen Arbeit schaffen kÃ¶nnen. Objektiv muÃ zunÃ¤chst die Genealogie der Kulturen, damit die Altersfolge und der Verwandtschafts- grad der einzelnen Erscheinungsformen herausgearbeitet werden.

The method of investigating totemism. By A. A. Goldenweiser, New York. In accordance with the plan of this symposium, I propose to present in the following pages a brief outline of my conception of totemism as first enunciated in "Totemism, an Analytical Study" and subsequently supplemented by a number of short articles1. Since the publication of my last printed state- ment, further study and discussion have resulted in minor modifications in point of view. These also may properly be embodied in the following presen- tation. Description of a Totemic Complex. - A survey of totemic communities justifies, I believe, the following generalized description of a totemic complex. In every totemic community we find the tribe differentiated into a number of social, units, clans. Within the limits of such clans the so-called "totemic" features are socialized. The specific content of the features differs from clan to clan but the form these features assume, their functional 1 Cf. "Totemism an Analytical Study", Journal of American Folk-lore, vol.

The totemic complex is thus constituted a firmly knit sociological integer, while the clans appear as equivalent totemic units. The integral character of the totemic complex as well as the differentiation into functionally equivalent, i. e. homo- logous, clans, cannot be sufficiently emphasized. No more faulty analogy could be conceived than to compare the clanmates of the various totemic clans to so many religious sects. Neither the attitude of rivalry or contempt, nor that of missionary zeal, perfectly plausible in such a religiously hetero- geneous community, can possibly be ascribed to the clans of a totemic complex. If, disregarding terminological difficulties, we were to designate the sum-total of totemic manifestations in a community as a religion, then we might say that whereas the totemic thought, emotion and activity is specifi- cally different for each clan, their religion is one. It will be noted that a generalized description of a totemic complex reveals, on the one hand, a phenomenon of specific socialization; on the other hand, the things that are socialized are "totemic" features. True, a more extensive acquaintance with totemic fact, has resulted in an appreciable multipli- cation of features which are known to appear as integral parts of totemic complexes. Nevertheless, such features do not embrace all possible forms of practice and belief, but, whether ceremonial, or artistic, or mythological, or eponymous, they center about certain beliefs entertained about animals, plants or inanimate objects. Thus while it is doubtless correct to designate such beliefs with their concomitants as "emotional values", such a designation is not sufficiently definitive. An illustration will make this clear. Among the Thompson Indians multiform relations obtain between individuals and animals (sometimes plants) in the form of guardian spirits. In addition, one finds that certain guardian spirits appear only to certain groups of people, such as hunters, gamblers, women, shamans. But such relations with guardian spirits remain among the Thompson Indians purely individual affairs (although the individual's choice may, as indicated above, be limited); in fact, we find among these Indians no clans, i. e., groups of actual or assumed kindred, within the limits of which such relations with animals, plants, &amp;c. could become socialized. There is no totemic complex. The situation is different among the Yukaghir. Here there exists a clearly defined gentile system. With each gens there are connected one or several shamans. Each shaman has in his control a number of guardian spirits, apparently all animal, with whose assistance he can influence to the good of man the numerous animal and anthropomorphic spirits constituting the Yukaghir Pantheon. But while each shaman claims his own protectors, his own peculiar powers, and to a large extent his own ritual, no one protector or power or group of protectors and powers are characteristic of the shaman or shamans of the separate clans; nor is there any special relation between certain gentes and certain domains of the spiritual world controlled by their shamans. In other words, the animism and mythology of these people, and the ritualistic activities and spiritual powers of ther shamans are in no sense specifically correlated with their Anthropos X- XI. 1916-1916. 17</page><page sequence="25">258 Ã. A. ÃOLDENWEISÃÃ*, social organization. There is no totemic complex. Again, among the tribes of the Iroquois League, there are clans and various features associated with the clans, such as sets of clan names, exogamy, certain property rights, &amp;c. These features are specific clan characteristics, they are socialized within the limits of the separate clans, but the content of the features is not characteristic of totemic communities, and the entire socio-psychological aspect of the Iroquois social system is therefore different. A purely descriptive generalized review of totemic communities when compared to non-totemic ones thus reveals the following descriptive characte- ristics of a totemic complex: 1. A tribe differentiated into clans, i. e., groups of actual or assumed kindred. 2. Certain so-called "totemic" features socialized within the limits of the clans, which constitute them as equivalent totemic units, and the entire system as an integral totemic organization. 3. The features center about beliefs referring to animals, plants and in- animate objects. It also appears that whereas totemic complexes characterized as above are sufficiently like one another to be designated by one term, neither the social units, nor the features, nor the processes of socialization, are in them- selves specifically totemic, in the sense of occurring only in totemic complexes and nowhere else. This suggests an analysis of totemic complexes from the point of view of content, development, and origin. The Totemic Complex and its Features. - The analysis of totemic complexes from the point of view of their features and the mode of their association was the main task of my "Totemism: an Analytical Study". The results there reached may now be briefly enumerated, in a somewhat modified form. While there is a great general resemblance in content between totemic complexes, there is also considerable variability, which in extreme cases, like those of the Northwest Coast and the Central Australian complexes, becomes great. Some features again are more constant than others: thus exogamy of the clans, "totemic" clan names, prohibition to kill or eat the totem animal, are more constant than the representation of the totem in art or the tracing of descent from the totem. The range covered by totemic features is much larger than was once supposed; nevertheless, the variety of features that appear in totemic complexes is by no means unlimited, an now that Frazer in his "Totemism and Exogamy" has given us a survey of most known totemic communities, our knowledge of the range of features that tend to appear in totemic complexes may be said to be fairly complete. As to the relative importance of different features in a given totemic complex, it appears that the different features are not as a rule of the same emotional value, some one feature often markedly predominating over the others and thus giving a distinct coloring to the entire complex. In different complexes different features fulfil this function. Totemic art in the Northwest Coast, complex magical ceremonies among the Australian Aranda, totemic taboos in many Bantu communities, may serve as examples of this.</page><page sequence="26">Das Problem des Totemismus. 259 A comparison of some totemic with non-totemic communities has shown that features familiar in totemic communities, such as totemic names, taboos, ideas of descent, magic ceremonies, &amp;c. are by no means restricted in their occurrence to such communities, but occur elsewhere in quite different con- texts; on the other hand, clearly defined totemic complexes may lack any of the so-called "totemic" features. Moreover, each one of the features may have different historical "origins" and different psychological settings. If that is true, then a totemic origin may not without special evidence be sacribed to a feature, even though it may form part of a totemic complex. Not that it may not be so derived, but it may also have an extratotemic origin. Thus animal taboos in a tribe may be derived from the fact that the animals are totems, or ani* mal taboos may have existed independently of the totemic organization and have been applied to the totems, or tabood animals may have become totems. The conclusion thus becomes inevitable that a totemic organization may not be regarded as a genetic unit, but that it constitutes a complex comprising heterogeneous cultural elements of multiple derivation. In other words the to- temic complex represents an association of such cultural elements, an asso- ciation which is achieved by means of their socialization within the limits of the social units or clans comprised in the system. If such is the nature of totemic complexes, how account for the geo- graphical distribution and specific characteristics of totemic communities as revealed by the data of ethnography? The Hypotheses of Parallelism, Diffusion and Convergence. - This is not the place to re-open the time-honored discussion of parallel developments. I believe, however, that at this stage of our knowledge most students of culture will agree that uniformities in complex processes of de- velopment are rare, and when the cultural phenomena and with them the processes that go to their making are highly complex, the probability of their recurrence even in two independent instances approaches zero. A totemic com- plex is a phenomenon of that type. It represents a highly complex aggregate of cultural features of varied psychological and historical derivation which be- come associated into a closely integrated psycho-sociological system. To assume parallelism here is more than even the most orthodox evo- lutionist should attempt. It is highly probable that isolated totemic processes have recurred again and again in totemic areas, in substantially similar forms; it seems also that the mechanism of totemic coordination, in its general fea- tures, must have been very much the same in all totemic complexes (see section on The Origin of a Totemic Complex); but the historic fates of different totemic complexes, the specific stages through which each has passed, must have been varied in the extreme. Evidence abounds of diffusion of totemic systems. In North America it has, in certain instances, been clearly demonstrated. The spread of features of the totemic organization of the Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian southward, the spread of entire complexes of totemic Northwest Coast features northward to the Eskimo and eastward to the Athapascan and Salish, are processes that may be regarded as practically historical. Nor is this all. The totemic complexes 17*</page><page sequence="27">Ã6Ã A. A. Goldenweiser, of certain Siouan tribes, or of the tribes of the North American Southwest, or of many of the Bantu tribes of Central Africa, or of the tribes of Central and North Australia and of those of the Southeast of that continent, reveal such far-reaching similarities coupled with geographical continuity, that in each and all of these instances extensive diffusion of totemic features and perhaps of entire totemic systems must be assumed to have occurred. The hypothesis of diffusion, however, cannot by itself solve the totemic problem. At best, it may implify our task by decreasing the number of complexes to be analysed. The task of reducing totemic systems to genetically integral cultural areas has not as yet been completed, but data at our disposal justify the assumption that the process of reduction will leave a considerable number of totemic cultures, more than one in each of the "totemic" continents, to be accounted for and interpreted by other methods than that of diffusion. The hypothesis of diffusion, rivalling that of independent development, was born of genuine insight into the nature of histori- cal processes; but the theory of diffusion uncritically applied, diffusion "beyond Space and Time", becomes the least historical of all ethnological hypotheses. There remains a third way of interpreting the similarities of totemic complexes: by means of the hypothesis of convergence. This hypothesis seems admirably fitted to account for the somewhat paradoxical situation1 The "origins" and historical developments of totemic complexes must be assumed to have been varied. Nevertheless, totemic complexes reveal sufficient similarities in their structure, contents, and what might be called their psycho-sociological flavor, to justify the designation of such complexes by one descriptive term. The hypothesis of convergence reconciles this actual similarity with genetic diversity. Totemic complexes may have had diverse origins, their histories may have been different, but through the working of certain psycho-sociological factors, the resulting totemic complexes are in many ways comparable. In fact, as suggested elsewhere, the theory of convergence may be utilized to account for three distinct aspects of totemic complexes. The separate features in two or more complexes, in so far as they are com- parable, must have often been due to convergence, for the objective and psychological history of such features must, in many instances, have been quite different. Again the totemic social structures with their features, which as a rule are strictly comparable, must be ascribed to convergence, for the order and specific mode of absortion of the features by the system, or their origin within the system must also have been vastly different in the several instances. The totemic association is a convergent process. And, finally, the totemization of the complex, the translation of the features of whatever de- rivation into totemic terms, must be regarded as a convergent process, which operates in the case of each complex with a psychically heterogeneous aggregate of cultural features, and through a process of assimilation moulds them into a totemic atmosphere which pervades all totemic complexes and constitutes perhaps the prime basis of their comparability. The totemic assi- milation is a convergent process. 1 For a more systematic theoretical discussion of this point see "Principle of Limited Possibilities" &amp;c. Journal of American Folk-Lore, vol. XXVI, 1913, p. 280-282.</page><page sequence="28">Das Problem des Totemismus. 261 Thus all three principles, parallelism, diffusion, and convergence, will find their place in furthering the reduction, classification and analysis of totemic complexes. While totemic complexes in their entirety may not be assumed to have originated through parallel an independent developments, isolated totemic processes must have recurred numerous times. Processes of diffusion of totemic features and perhaps of entire systems must certainly have taken place, resulting in highly comparable totemic organizations spread over wide and continuous geographical areas. Genetically independent totemic complexes, finally, must be ascribed to multiple processes of convergence. The Origin of a Totemic Complex. - The preceding remarks indicate that a uniform origin for totemic complexes may not be posited. True, some origins, such as totemic names of clans, or perhaps totemic taboos, may have occurred more often than others, but this circumstance, if true, is not significant, and the fact remains that multiple possibilities of totemic origins readily present themselves. Moreover, such first origins must in no sense be taken to represent potential totemic complexes. They are nothing but starting points of complexes, when looked at from the point of view of their concrete contents. The complex itself, being the product of an association of features through processes of socialization of such features in a clan system, must from the *start present certain aspects of social organization and of psychological attitude, with reference to which the individual features, whether they happen to appear earlier or later in the making of the complex, are factors of altogether subordinate importance. Of greater interest is it to understand the mechanism through which a totemic complex comes into being. I have suggested such a mechanism in "The Origin of Totemism" (American Anthropologist, 1912). The argument there presented is briefly as follows. The totemic association must of necessity be a lengthy process occupying considerable periods of time during which the individual features are "evolved" within the complex or are drawn in from outside, socialized in the clans and psychologically assimilated. Now, it has been remarked before that, from the point of view of their features, the clans of a totemic system constitute equivalent totemic units, i. e., the features, while differing in content, are functionally the same in all the clans of the system. Clearly, one may not assume that these functional characteristics of the clans developed independently in each clan. In other words, there must have been a process of diffusion of features from clan to clan. Not indeed in the sense that the identical concrete feature spread from clan to clan, but that the appearance of equivalent features in one clan was followed by the appearance of equivalent features in the other clans of the system. Thus the process of totemic association must be conceived of as a series of successive cycles of diffusion of totemic features, justifying the designation of this theory of the origin or more strictly of the development of a totemic complex, as the pattern theory.1 1 For an alternative version of the theory with reference to the early stages of a totemic complex as well as for some special applications of the pattern theory, se "The Origin of To- temism", American Anthropologist, vol. XIV, 1912, p. 605, note 2, and p. 606-607.</page><page sequence="29">262 A. A. Goldenweiser, Religous Societies and Totemic Complexes. - Outside the domain of totemism there exists another form of association of cultural fea- tures which presents striking similarities to the totemic association. I refer to religious societies such as are found in the American Northwest, among the Omaha and cognate tribes, among certain tribes of Indians in the Southwest, in West Africa, in Melanesia. In religious societies as in totemic complexes, there is a subdivision of the tribe into social units, there is socialization of heterogeneous features within the limits of such units; moreover a tribal group of religious societies is no less a complex than a totemic system, and must be interpreted as an association of features of varied historical and psycho- logical derivation. Is there any justification then to keep the two sets of pheno- mena apart and distinguish them by separate terminologies? That such a course is justified will appear from an examination of the differences between tribal clusters of religious societies, on the one hand, and totemic complexes, on the other. In the two instances we are dealing with entirely different types of so- cial units. The religious societies are social units only in so far as they are religious societies, that is, their functions as religious societies constitute them social units. The clans of a totemic complex, on the other hand, while carrying totemic functions, are not constituted social units by the exercise of such functions, but by the inherent character of their social composition: they are hereditary groups of individuals united by the bonds of actual or assumed kinship. This circumstance has important corollaries. Clans often stand in in- timate relations to localities, houses, exogamy, phratries and dual divisions, relationship systems, all features with which religious societies have no bonds whatsoever. This fundamental difference of kind between the social units which carry the religious functions of societies and those which carry the totemic functions of totemic complexes, changes the entire psycho-sociological character of the complexes in the two instances. There are other less significant differences: the hereditary element, essential in a clan, is by no means indispensable in a religious society, although a tendency towards the hereditary transmission of the privileges of a society may often be discerned; the religious attitude towards the animal or other spiritual guardian, is much more pronounced in religious societies than it is in clans; the individual aspect is much more marked and important in the relation of a member of a religious society to his guardian, than it is in the relation of a totemite to his totem. In principle the relation of totemic complexes to tribal clusters of religious societies is like the relation of totemic tribes to tribes of the Thomson River type, or of the Yukaghir type, or of the Iroquois type. Among the Thompson Indians some features are present which also occur in totemic complexes, but there is no social system with which these features could be correlated; among the Yukaghir we find the features and the social system, but the association of the two, characteristic of totemic communities, is absent; the social system exists among the Iroquois as well as the phenomenon of socialization of certain features, but the features that are socialized are not the kind of features that occur in totemic society; in religious societies, finally, we find the features, and the</page><page sequence="30">Das Problem des Totemismus. 263 socialization, and the socal units; the tribal clusters of societies, moreover, are, most probably, complexes like totemic systems, complexes due to secon- dary association of genetically heterogeneous features and exhibiting the phe- nomenon of convergence; but the social units which are constituted by the religious societies are not the kind of social units that carry the features of totemic complexes. However similar to totemic complexes in many respects, both descriptively and theoretically, tribal clusters of religious societies display certain typical differences from the latter; a religious society is not a totemic clan, and it is proper that the two sets of phenomena should be distinguished terminologically and that the problems presented by them should be regarded as distinct. It goes without saying, on the other hand, that a comparative study of religious societies and of totemic complexes may lead to most instructive results and that further search for possible genetic connections, in some areas, between religious societies and totemic clans - a possibility often suggested but never demonstrated - is highly desirable1. A Note on Terminology. - In the course of totemic research and discussion, various questions of terminology have often arisen. I do not pro- pose to re-open them here. There is one, however, which has not so far re- ceived any attention but is likely to come up for discussion in the near future. In North America, India, and elsewhere, we know of a number of tribes that have clans with animal names and exogamy but otherwise lack the characteristics of totemic communities. Such clans and tribes are often designated as totemic. Is such a designation justifiable? As an argument covering this issue has been presented in another place, I shall reproduce it here verbatim. "Animal and bird names given to individuals, societies, social groups, objects, are so common a feature in primitive society, that one may not, without special reasons, ascribe the presence of animal and bird clan names to some "special relation" bet- ween the clan-mates and their eponym. In other words, these names may be given or assumed just as nicknames, local names, honorific names, are given or assumed, and no special significance need be ascribed to them. Similarly, the exogamy of these clans may not have any more to do, either historically or psychologically, with either the names or the eponymous species themselvesÂ» than it has with the local names or nicknames of the Haida or Crow clans. In the absence of any special processes, it would not seem justifiable to apply a separate term, the term "totemic" to exogamous clans of animal name, while refusing this appellation to exogamous clans with nicknames, or local names, or names derived from a human ancestor. On the other hand, the animal name may be psychologically associated with the animal, in the minds of the givers or the receivers of the name, or of both. The exogamy of the clan may also, from its very inception, be traceable tho this association with the animal, either directly or through the medium of the clan name. Here a "special" process could be discerned, and the therm "totemic" would 1 A signal attempt in that direction, without definitive results, however, was made by Hutton Webste^ in his "Totem Clans and Secret Associations in Australia and Melanesia", Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol.

But this totemic source of the name and of the exogamy may become obliterated. It would then be often impossible to decide whether the totemic association had taken place or not. In view of the plausibility of the origin of animal names without any special association with the animal, and of the origin of exogamy in animal-named clans1 without involving any relation either to the animal or the animal name, it seems, on the whole, advisable not to apply the term "totemic" to tribes which, without exhibiting any active totemic processes, comprise exogamous clans with animal, bird (ort plant) names, unless it can be shown that in their origin these traits involved a psychological association with the animal. In cases of this latter type, which at best would represent but a very small number of instances, one might justifiably use the term "totemic" in view of the traits, or - with equal justice - abstain from using the term, in view of the actual absence of any totemic processes. Summary. - The substance of the foreoing remarks may now be expressed in the following propositions. The essential descriptive characteristics of a totemic complex are 1. Cultural features, ceremonial, artistic, mythological, &amp;c, centering about beliefs with respect to animals, plants or inaminate objects. 2. A subdivision of the tribe into definite social units, or clans. 3. Socialization of equivalent features within the limits of the clans. A totemic complex is an aggregate of associated and assimilated cultural features of varied historical and psychological derivation. While parallelisms of isolated totemic processes have probably occurred, and diffusion of totemic features and perhaps even entire totemic systems has certainly taken place, the similarities in content, structure and function of genetically unrelated totemic complexes must be ascribed to convergence. The search for specific "first origins" of totemic complexes, is vain; but an analysis of the composition of a totemic complex indicates that the mechanism of totemic growth must consist of a series of cycles of diffusion of totemic features through the system. Tribal clusters of religious societies and totemic complexes reveal striking similarities in content, structure, and probable historical derivation, but typical differences are also observable due to the fundamental difference of kind of the social units which constitute the social substratum of the two phenomena. They should, therefore, be kept apart. In conclusion I should like to suggest a number of investigations which, in my judgement, would further the solution of totemic problems: 1. A reduction of totemic areas to genetically related totemic cultures. 2. A minute description and intensive analysis of totemic complexes from the point of view of concrete content, interrelation of features, and the psycho-sociological aspect of the 1 The chronological order of development of the two traits could be reversed without affecting the argument.</page><page sequence="32">Das Problem des Totemismus. 265 entire system1. 3. A study of "totemic" features, clan systems and processes of socialization within and without totemic systems. Such a study would serve to throw light on whatever there is specifically totemic in the content and workings of a totemic system. A comparative study of religious societies and totemic complexes would constitude part of such an investigation. 4. A recon- struction, wherever possible, of the development and assimilation of individual features in totemic complexes, to lay bare the causes and mechanisms of secondary associasions and of convergent developments. (To be continued.) 1 The comparative study of the concrete concrete contents of totemic complexes would be much facilitated by the use of the tabular method as exemplified in "Totemism, an Analytical Study" Journal of American Folk-lore, vol. XXIII, 1910, p. 229.</page></plain_text>
