<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INEFFABLE Critical Notes on Neo-Mysticism By MEIR BEN-HORIN Hebrew Teachers College, Brookline, Mass. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into still subtler form. Herman Melville, Moby Dick GERSHOM G. SCHOLEM sounds the following warning at the conclusion of the first of his nine lectures published under the title Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (Jerusa- lem: Schocken, 1941): It cannot be denied, he states, that if one turns to the writings of the great Kabbalists one seldom fails to be torn between alternate admiration and disgust. There is need for being quite clear about this in a time like ours, when the fashion of uncritical and super- ficial condemnation of even the most valuable elements in mysticism threatens to be replaced by an equally un- critical and obscurantist glorification of the Kabbalah ... Philosophy came dangerously near to losing the living God; Kabbalism, which set out to preserve Him, to blaze a new and glorious trail to Him, encountered mythology on its way and was tempted to lose itself in its labyrinth.' In view of the current vogue of neo-mystical writings and preachments, Dr. Scholem's admonition deserves reitera- tion and careful consideration. It is well to keep in mind that, when judged in terms of social consequences, mys- Ibid., pp. 35-36. 321</page><page sequence="2">322 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ticism cannot escape the charge of having inspired gross immorality and perversion. Its effects, even for the religious spirit which it professes to express and to foster, were quite fatal when, in Sabbatianism, it produced "an outburst of more or less veiled nihilistic tendencies," encouraged "a mood of religious anarchism,"2 taught "the tragic paradox of an apostate Saviour,"3 preached a voluntary Marranism with the slogan: We must all descend into the realm of evil in order to vanquish it from sin. In varying theoretical guises the apostles of nihilism preached the doctrine of the existence of spheres in which the process of Tikkun (restoration of cosmic harmony) can no longer be advanced by pious acts. Evil must be fought with evil. We are thus gradually led to . . the fatal, yet at the same time deeply fasci- nating (sic!) doctrines of the holiness of sin.4 In nineteenth century Hasidism which, according to Solomon Schechter, "amounted to a genuine Reformation, pure and lofty in ideal," it offered through "Zaddikism" or belief in "a kind of God-man" inducements which made it a lucrative deception "for every scheming charlatan to become a Zaddik" who was interested to crush and keep down every trace of reflection and thought.5 The late Professor Louis Ginzberg credits Jewish mys- ticism "with two great services to the development of Judaism: it repressed both Aristotelianism and Talmudic formalism." Yet he concludes his survey with this sober evaluation: These beneficial influences of the Cabala are, however, counterbalanced by several most pernicious ones. From the metaphysical axiom, that there is nothing in the 2 Ibid., p. 295. 3 Ibid., p. 303. 4 Ibid., p. 311. s S.

Demonology ... occupies an important position in the works of many cabalists .... Natural magic depends largely on man himself; for, according to the Cabala, all men are endowed with in- sight and magical powers which they may develop. The means especially mentioned are: Kawwanah = intense meditation, in order to attract the higher spritiual influ- ence; a strong will, exclusively directed toward its object; and a vivid imagination, in order that the impressions from the spiritual world may enter profoundly into the soul and be retained there. From these principles many cabalists developed their theories on casting of lots, necromancy, exorcism, and many other superstitions .... Astrology was legitimized, and bibliomancy found its justification in the assumption that the sacred Hebrew letters are not merely signs for things, but implements of divine powers by means of which nature may be sub- jugated. It is easy to see that all these views were most pernicious in their influence on the intellect and soul of the Jew.6 Nor, indeed, is the opposition to mysticism merely an offshoot of modernism. The Mishna (Hagiga, II, 1) warns against "certain kinds" of inquiry: "He who speculates about four things should not have come into the world: about that which is above, about that which is beneath, about that which was before and about that which will be. And he who acts irreverently towards the glory of his cre- ator should not have come into the world." To engage in mystical speculation, as Rabbi Leo Baeck interprets this passage,7 was acting irreverently toward the glory of God.

Restrictions were imposed upon teaching and spec- ulating on matters of cosmogony, on Ma'aseh Merkabah (the divine chariot described by Ezekiel), and on revealing the Tetragrammaton. "There was even a certain revulsion against the state of ecstasy per se. Highly extolled, as we recall, by Philo, ecstatic trance (marmita, or rather mor- motos) was still counted by Rab alongside of ordinary sleep and prophetic vision, as a third important manifestation of the biblical tardemah (deep sleep). To which the major- ity retorted, 'There also is deep sleep of stupidity.' (Gen. Rab. XVII, 5, 156 f., with reference to I Sam. 26.12 [Rab]; Isa. 29.9-10 [the sages]."8 There is, of course, the whole tradition of medieval rationalism which strove to achieve a unity of "revelation and reason, religion and philosophy, faith and knowledge, authority and independent reflection."9 While it is true that, in the context of medieval philosophizing, "reason" is not "human intelligence" in the sense of man's power to reconstruct his experience by adapting means that are conditions to specific chosen ends; while it must be con- ceded that "reason" is often a set of documents, Aristotel- ian, Platonic, or commentatorial - none the less there is a measure of truth in Graetz's sweeping judgment that Saadya Gaon (892-942) "was the founder of scientific Judaism amongst the Rabbanites, and the creator of re- ligious philosophy in the Middle Ages."Io For Saadya, 8 Salo W.

To a large extent this holds true also of cabalistic speculation."I4 Yet the thoroughgoing opposition of pronounced strands Double Faith Theory in Clement, Saadia, Averroes and St. Thomas, And Its Origin in Aristotle and The Stoics," ibid., pp. 122-135) docu- ments the view that Saadia upheld "the equality of undemonstrated faith and demonstrated faith."

It is one thing to let Rabbi Ishmael in Midrash Mishle enumerate the questions which the doctors of the Torah will be asked by God on the Day of Judgment, such as: How the throne of My glory stands; what the first of its feet serves as; ... the fiery stream under the throne of My glory, which is round like a stone made of brick;... how I stand from the nails of My feet to the parting of My hair; how great is the measure of My palm, and what is the measure of My toes ....I5 It is quite another to argue as does Maimonides in the Guide for the Perplexed, Part II, Chapter VI: ... natural forces and angels are identical. How bad and injurious is the blindness of ignorance! Say to a person who is believed to belong to the wise men of Israel that the Almighty sends His angel to enter the womb of a woman and to form there the foetus, he will be satisfied with the account; he will believe it, and even find in it a description of the greatness of God's might and wis- dom .... But tell him that God gave the seed a forma- tive power which produces and shapes the limbs, and that this power is called 'angel,' ... and he will turn away; because he cannot comprehend the true greatness and power of creating forces that act in a body without being perceived by our senses.I6 It is one thing to indulge in speculations (Zohar, I, 9b) on one of the seven "earths," visited by Cain after his en- counter with Abel, in which the two rulers, Afrira and Kastimon, resembling holy angels, each with six wings, both with one face like an ox and one like an eagle, try "to awake the appetites of the Cainites, that the latter may Is Scholem, op. cit., p. 70. i6 Moses Maimonides, The Guide For The Perplexed (M.

And if the Torah, taken in the simple meaning of its words, stands in opposition to this truth, then the [Torah's] words need to be interpreted in a manner which corresponds with speculative reason.... And it is evident: if speculation on such problems [as creation versus eternity of the world or God's corporeality versus His spirituality] brought us to positions which appear to conflict with what appears from the simple wording of the Torah, then we need not be prevented by the Torah from proclaiming the truth in these problems, for the Torah is not a law which obligates us to believe falsehoods but rather guides us to the end of grasping the truth as fully as possible.'8 Thus, in Dubnow's language, there has been apparent from time immemorial a struggle for supremacy between two principles in Judaism: the formalism of dogmatic ritual and the direct religious sentiment. The discipline of the Law was in continual conflict with mystical meditation... Such was the struggle between Pharisaism and Essenism in ancient times, between Talmudism and the Cabala in the Middle Ages, and between rabbinism and the mystic-Messianic movements from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century.'9 The following critical notes on recent Jewish expositions of mysticism may therefore be regarded as a link, however weak and inadequate, in the unbroken chain of our tradi- '7 Bernard J.

Or in Saadya's terms, based on Plato's Republic: "The psyche has three powers - desire, anger, and reason.... Whoever sub- ordinates his anger and his lust to the power of his discern- ment, is a moral person."20 The succeeding remarks are grounded in the belief that absolute and irresponsible fancy can be the basis of no duty. If not to take other real forces and interests into account made classic states unstable and unjust, to take into consideration purely imaginary forces yields a polity founded on superstition, one unjust to those who live under it. A compromise made with non-existent or irrelevant interests is a wrong to the real interests on which that sacrifice is imposed gratuitously.21 I Among the sustained efforts to transplant and transpose mysticism into contemporary Jewish life in America are the recent works by Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel. In a number of essays and in his books The Earth Is The Lord's, Man Is Not Alone, The Sabbath,22 and Man's Quest For God Professor Heschel endeavors to formulate what he chooses to designate as "a philosophy of religion," one that first discusses "not belief, ritual or the religious experience, but the source of all these phenomena: the total situation 20 Saadya Gaon, Sefer Ha-Emunot weha-Deot (New York: OM Pub- lishing Co., 1947), Ch.

In the following sections of this paper some crucial aspects of Heschel's neo-mysticism will be subsumed and analyzed under the general heading of "The Ineffable," taken from Man Is Not Alone, the main statement of his position. The term "ineffable" in Heschel's treatise is synonymous with "grandeur" (p. 3), "the sublime," "the unutterable" (p. 4), "the profoundly undisclosed, a ripple of inveterate silence" (p. 6), "the unexplorable," "the unknown,"24 "the nameless" (p. 7), "the metalogical" (p. 8), "mystery" (p. 14). At the same time it is "the true meaning, source and end of being" which "smites us with unquenchable amazement."25 Now ordinarily the "unknown" and "the true meaning" are mutually exclusive terms. A meaning 23 Man Is Not Alone (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Young, 1951), p. 55. 24 On p. 22 Heschel maintains that "the ineffable is not a synonym for the unknown or the nondescript" but that it denotes "an allusiveness to something meaningful." On p. 26, however, he insists, that "the meaning of the things we revere is overwhelming and beyond the grasp of our understanding .... it essentially surpasses our criteria." All of which amounts to nothing but the momentous assertion that "the ineffable" alludes to something meaningful which in itself, being "beyond the grasp of our understanding," has no meaning and, hence, is "overwhelming." It follows that "the unknown" is either identical with that which is "beyond the grasp of our understanding" which, in turn, is "the ineffable" or else "the unknown" is identical with "the known" rendering it likewise- unknown. In truth, the ineffabilist cannot distinguish between the two. For knowing the unknown is unknowing the known. 25 Pp. 4-5. On pages 22-23 Heschel identifies, as the preceding note indicates, "the ineffable" with "allusiveness to something" etc. Thus "the ineffable" is both "the true meaning" and allusion to the true meaning. And what is this but Thought-Thinking-Itself or Thought- Thoughtless?</page><page sequence="10">330 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW needs to be known as true or false, real or illusory, ethical or barbarous, indeed, as meaning. However, in order to pene- trate farther into what will be referred to as "ineffabilism," the interchangeability of "unknown" and "mystery" needs to be remembered. In the sight of mystery logical incon- sistency dissolves into naught. The illogical is logical when "metalogical." Ineffabilism may thus proceed to expound that, even though "the unexplorable" offers resistance to our categories, man knows, with his "ability to know that there is more than what he knows" (p. 20), that it refers to "something objective" and "something real which, by its very essence, is beyond the reach of thought and feeling." (p. 20) Hence, "the unknown" is not really unknown if "knowing" denotes what I should call "knowing-beyond- knowing" or "metaknowing." Consequently, the "inef- fable" is "the true meaning" if meaning means "meaning- the-meaningless" or "metameaning" which corresponds to "the metalogical" already quoted. Briefly, the "ineffable" is "the true meaning" because it is grounded in meta- anything-at all, meta-adjective-X,-in, say, meta-tron. "The awareness of the ineffable," Heschel postulates, "is that with which our search must begin." (p. 8) For mystery precedes information: "The awareness of the unknown is earlier than the awareness of the known. The tree of knowledge grows upon the soil of mystery." (p. 7) Once again Heschel's language exhibits the peculiarity just alluded to: words used sub specie ineffabilis divest them- selves of ordinary meanings and, if taken in their ordinary meanings, prompt unwarranted conclusions. Hence, in- effabilist texts require frequent retranspositions from para-ordinary meanings to ordinary meanings. Thus the two statements under consideration obviously do not offer a less common reference to man's commonly- known emergence from pre-human bestiality and ignorance</page><page sequence="11">THE INEFFABLE-BEN-HORIN 331 and to his rise, in the course of millennia, to current states of relative humanity and the possession of at least temporarily reliable hypotheses about the world and about himself. Obviously, ineffabilism is not Darwinism or Freudianism. It is not evolution and naturalistic history of mind that, although implied for the sake of credibility, can be meant by our author's terms "earlier than." Man cannot speak of the unspeakable except in "unspeak" or "metaspeak," the "ineffabilist" dialect using ordinary language for extra- ordinary connotations. "Earlier than" in this proposition means not "more remote in evolution or in history." It can only mean "more deeply mysterious." Now since "aware- ness of the known," like "seeing anything at all" (p. 12) is also a matter of amazement and mystery, it follows that we must read our passage to mean: The awareness of the unknown is more deeply mysterious than the awareness of the known or, more generally, meta-mystery is to be distinguished from mystery. Yet this is nothing but another way of stating that meta-mystery is true mystery or that the "ineffable" is - ineffable. It is evidence for the circularity and vacuity of ineffabilist "doctrine." In similar fashion, "the tree of knowledge grows upon the soil of mystery" cannot mean, as it is intended to mean, that ordinary or scientific knowledge developed from ques- tions directed at mysterious Mother Nature25a and from 25a Heschel suggests that since God is the Creator of both nature and man, "the earth is our sister, not our mother" (p. 115; see also his The Sabbath, New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Young, 1951, p. 56). One might, of course, say that both mothers and sisters can be created and hence our "mother" need not be our "Creator." However, Heschel clearly is concerned to blur the essential difference between the human and the pre-human deriving from man's creative intelligence. Our "sister" earth, say, the ground on which we tread, and we humans are, in the sight of the ineffabilist, intellectual siblings. Heschel's position here significantly contrasts with the many passages in Rabbinic literature in which "there is not a single endearing epithet in the language, such as brother, sister, bride, mother, lamb, or eye,</page><page sequence="12">332 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW responses verified in observation and experimentation. For, again, ineffabilism is not objective science. While it sounds scientific to say that "what the sense of the ineffable per- ceives is something objective" (p. 20), it means not "objec- tive" in the sense of the ordinarily effable, that is, in the sense of events constituting human experience. The "objec- tive" in the ineffabilist context is meta-objective or beyond objectivity and subjectivity alike. It is transexperiential as it is transexperimental. It is not objective but - man being a cis-experiential creature - con-jective or sheer conjectural. It is ad-jective qualifying any noun at all or no noun whatever. The "awareness of the unknown," being a complex ab- straction beyond the mental habits of primitive or pre- historic man, comes not earlier than but later than the awareness of the known objects of experience (say, cave, woman, child, beast, fire, rock). Similarly, the tree of knowledge grows not upon the soil of mystery but out of experience transformed by human intelligence which is a special kind of experiencing. (Little but mystery grows on the soil of mystery.) Moreover, the sense of the ineffable, being a sense neither in the sense of sight or hearing nor in the sense of emotion like love or fear nor in the sense of reason that seeks to apply real means to achieve ideal which is not, according to the Rabbis, applied by the Scriptures to express [the] intimate relation between God and his people." (S. Schech- ter, Some Aspects of Rabbinic Theology, New York: Macmillan, 1910, pp. 46-47). It is worth noting that a measure of discrepancy may also be de- tected in Catholic theology and mysticism in this matter of "family relationships." While St. Francis of Assisi (1182-1226) speaks of sun and moon as our brother and sister (Laude delle Creature/Bluetenkranz, O. v. Taube, translator, Jena: Diederichs, 1905, p. 81), Julian of Nor- wich (1342-c. 1415) designates Jesus as "our Very Mother." (Paul de Jaegher, S. J., An Anthology of Mysticism, Westminster, Md., Newman Press, 1950, pp. 94 ff.) The Roman Catholic Bishops of the United States, on the other hand, call Jesus "our Brother." (New York Times, November 21, 1954.)</page><page sequence="13">THE INEFFABLE-BEN-HORIN 333 ends, perceives nothing objective, meaning both the extra- human and the intra-existential. The ineffable is beyond all sense of sensing. For to ineffabilize is to metasense. Finally, the very notion of perception - "what the sense of the ineffable perceives" -is, ineffabilistically speaking, rather deceptive. For perception refers to effabilities, remaining - like conception and sensation - on this side of the beyond. Now the decoding of the three foregoing ineffabilist propositions into ordinary parlance yields the following: 1. The awareness of the unknown which is the mystically or ineffabilistically known should take precedence over the awareness of the known which is the mystically negligible. 2. The tree of (mystical) knowledge grows upon the soil of mystery. 3. What the ineffabilist perceives or rather super- ceives is meta-objectivity or an objectivity not of this world. It is irrevocably subjective or, keeping in mind ineffabilism's propensity for sorrow and sigh,26 one might risk calling it - sobjective. II When does "the sense of the ineffable" function? It functions when our ordinary senses lie dormant: "Try to see the world for the first time with eyes not dimmed by 26 Heschel, The Earth Is The Lord's (New York: H. Schuman, 1950), p. 16: "There were many [among the Jews of Eastern Europe] who did not trust words, and their deepest thoughts would find expression in a sigh. Sorrow was their second soul, and the vocabulary of their heart consisted of one sound: 'Oy!' "- One may observe that OY is not the only monosyllabic "vocabulary of the heart" in mysticism. OM is of mystical significance in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Probably an exclamation in origin, it appears in the Bhagavad-Gita, for example, as a synonym for Brahman, the total Godhead, absolute knowledge, Existence itself. (Bhagavad-Gita: The Song of God, New York: New American Library, 1954, pp. 82, 89, 119, 130.) With OM and the Greek On meaning existence, one may speak of existentialism as OMism and of OYism as its Jewish form or, simply, of-"sigh-ence."</page><page sequence="14">334 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW memory or volition, and you will detect that you and the things that surround you - trees, birds, chairs - are like parallel lines that run close and never meet. Your pretense of being acquainted with the world is quickly abandoned." (p. 5) Memory or the totality of our accumulated knowl- edge, including language, dims our eyes.27 In Jewish terms, the Torah, the sum total of Jewish learning; in general terms - the whole range of knowledge, all that from the first day of our lives constitutes our education - needs to be abandoned as pretense, as that which "dims our eyes." Then, the moment after this self-induced amnesia, after the enucleation of our minds, it requires little insight to notice the unfamiliarity of once familiar sights. This is the moment, however, at which the ineffabilist becomes aware of the strange world's true meaning. For "wonder or radical amazement, the state of maladjustment to words and notions, is... a prerequisite for an authentic awareness of that which is." (p. 11)28 The neo-mystic's formula for our schools clearly is education for "maladjustment to words and notions." Professor Heschel repeatedly returns to the need for what amounts to total or "higher" amnesia or enucleation of mind:29 "Try to think reality itself, forget what you 27 Muhammad al-Ghazali (The Faith and Practice of Al-Ghazali by W. Montgomery Watt, London: G. Allen and Unwin, 1953, p. 128), twelfth century Moslem philosopher-mystic, wrote in his Beginning of Guidance: "Go... to the circle of profitable knowledge, that is, the knowledge which increases your fear of God most high and decreases your desire of this world; ignorance is better for you than all the knowl- edge which does not draw you away from this world towards the next." In his Alchemy of Happiness (H. A. Homes, translator; Albany, J. Munsell, 1873), pp. 23-24 he wrote: "In death, as the senses are com- pletedly separated and the veil of the body removed, the heart can con- template the invisible world and its hidden mysteries, without a veil .. ." 28 Schizophrenia being the splitting of the mind, this maladjustment may be called sbennyphrenia, wiping the mind clean of mind. 29 From The Cloud of Unknowing, a fourteenth century treatise of Christian mysticism: "And therefore it was that St. Denis said: 'the</page><page sequence="15">THE INEFFABLE-BEN-HORIN 335 know, and you realize at once your distressing famishment." (p. 7) He deplores the fact that "philosophy, enticed by the promise of the known, has often surrendered the treasures of higher incomprehension to poets and mystics, although without the sense of the ineffable there are no metaphysical problems, no awareness of being as being, of value as value." (p. 8)30 "Wonder alone is the compass that may direct us to the pole of meaning." (p. 16) On the one hand, "the approach to the ineffable leads through the depth of knowledge rather than through ignorant animal gazing." (p. 15) Yet on the other, "to become aware of most godly knowing of God is that which is known by unknowing.' " "Look that naught work in thy mind nor in thy will but only God. And try to smite down all knowing and feeling of aught under God, and tread all down full far under the cloud of forgetting." (Quoted from Paul de Jaegher, S. J., op. cit., pp. 90, 91.) 30 "Higher ignorance" was already recommended in St. Dionysius the Areopagite's first century Mystical Theology. He wrote: He who aspires to tread the mystic way, "must abandon the things which are merely intellectual and the conceptions of the intellect, all perceptions, indeed, conveyed by the senses, 'all things which are not and likewise things which are,' and thus, human understanding being wholly laid to sleep, he must with mighty effort... strain upwards to union with Him Who is above all understanding and beyond all knowledge. So the mystic will attain to that divine Darkness which is radiant Light." And the mystic of mystics, St. John of the Cross (1542-1591), writes: "The soul must not only be disencumbered from that which belongs to the creatures, but likewise, as it journeys on, it must be annihilated and detached from all that belongs to its spirit." (Both quotes from M. Summers, The Physical Phenomena of Mysticism, London: Rider &amp; Co., 1950, sec. impression, p. 25). Lewis Mumford's comment (In the Name of Sanity, New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1954, p. 151) on modern painting is relevant here: "... by now the cult of the meaningless is a grimly humorless one: the negative responses that its empty splotches and scrawls at first provoke in a perceptive mind will be met, on the part of the devotees, with a fanatic gleam of reproach. Cracks, erosions, smudges, denials of all order or intelligibility ... this is the ultimate form and content of the fashionable art of the last decade. To gaze piously into this ultimate emptiness has become the last word in art appreciation today." In ineffabilism, I submit, it is "the last word" in Jewish religious apprecia- tion today. But, happily, the last is not the final.</page><page sequence="16">336 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the ineffable is to part company with words," (p. 16) "the realm where genius is at home, where insight is at work, logic can hardly find access to," (p. 17) and "we have a certainty without knowledge." (p. 22) On the one hand, the sense of the ineffable is "the climax of thought, indigenous to the climate that prevails at the summit of intellectual behavior, where such works as the last quartets of Beet- hoven come into being." (p. 19) Yet, "we cannot deny the superiority of the ineffable to our minds" and it is the sense of the ineffable "that communicates to us the supremacy and grandeur of the ineffable together with the knowledge of its reality." (p. 32) It refers to "something which is more than the known." (p. 61) It is to be contrasted with "the shallowness of mere reflection." (p. 60) In sum, the sense of the ineffable is "the awareness of a reality that dis- ,credits our wisdom, that shatters our concepts." (p. 61) It is the possession of "a mind unwarped by intellectual habit, unbiased by what it already knows." (p. 58) It is the beginning of religion. (p. 59) A noteworthy parallel to the Jewish neo-mystic's hymns to "higher ignorance" and that which "discredits our wis- dom" may be found in the sermons of Meister Eckhart (1260-1327), a Dominican scholar, founder of German medieval mysticism. Said he: If a man will work an inward work, he must pour all his powers into himself as into a corner of the soul, and must hide himself from all images and forms, and then he can work. Then he must come into a forgetting and a not-knowing. He must be in a stillness and silence, where the Word may be heard. One cannot draw near to this Word better than by stillness and silence: then it is heard and understood in utter ignorance. When one knows nothing, it is opened and revealed. Then we shall become aware of the Divine Ignorance, and our ignorance</page><page sequence="17">THE INEFFABLE-BEN-HORIN 337 will be ennobled and adorned with supernatural knowledge.3I It is a remarkable doctrine which, as "a philosophy of religion," rises to propagate the divine nature not of omni-science but of om-nescience, not of all-wisdom but of sigh (see note 26 above) and ignorance. Far from being "a philosophy of religion," a love of knowledge in religion, it is rather a religion of philagnosy, love of unenlightenment. Far from being "a philosophy of religion," it is much rather a phobosophy, a fear of knowledge - neither essentially philosophic nor religious. III The "sense of the ineffable," Heschel consistently con- tends, is vastly superior to "ordinary" human knowledge: "How would we know of the mystery of being if not through our sense of the ineffable, and it is this sense that communi- cates to us the supremacy and grandeur of the ineffable together with the knowledge of its reality. Thus, we cannot deny the superiority of the ineffable to our minds, although, for the same reason, we cannot prove it." (p. 32) Now it should be noted that in these propositions the "ineffable" has lost a good deal of its ineffability. Heschel suggests that the "ineffable" is capable of "communicating to us" about itself, namely, about its "supremacy and grandeur" and about its reality which, as one may expect, cannot be but "supreme" and "grand." It follows that "the ineffable," if not perhaps supremely modest, is certainly supremely capable of effability. It is that which com- municates with us more effectively and more understand- 3' Quoted from Evelyn Underhill, Mysticism (New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1912), fourth edition, p. 381.</page><page sequence="18">338 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ably than our own mind. We mortals "are unable either to define or to describe the ineffable," yet "it is given to us (!) to point to it. By means of indicative rather than descriptive terms, we are able to convey to others those features of our perception which are known to all men." (p. 21) Clearly it is this power of "supreme" communication about its own superiority which constitutes the "ineffable's" superiority over our minds. However, a number of diffi- culties arise. First, "supremacy," "grandeur" and "reality" are positive assertions, not indications or intimations. To ascribe "supremacy" and "grandeur" to a reality is hardly to use "indicative" terms. Description does not turn indication when it abounds in turgescent superlatives. Any positive statement, including a declaration of existence or reality, cannot fall under "indication" unless these terms are not meant to convey what they normally do convey, unless "supremacy" stands for something beyond it, unless "grandeur" refers to "super-grandeur," unless "reality" points to infinite successions of meta-realities. Heschel, in fact, postulates that "to be implies to stand for" (p. 31), from which it follows that all descriptions are indications and that, to Heschel, the distinction is merely a self-protective device to escape responsibility for positive assertions. More- over, the proposition that "to be" is "to stand for, because every being is representative of something that is more than itself; because the seen, the known, stands for the unseen, the unknown" (p. 31) is itself a positive, descriptive asser- tion, albeit a fearfully absurd one. It implies that nothing really exists. If to be is to stand for, then to be is to stand for another to be. In this case little is gained, for the second to be stands for a third to be and so on ad infinitum where the ultimate to be again stands for a penultimate to be and so on ad nauseam. Hence, this typewriter, this desk, this reader are a mirage. The only conceivable gain is that to be</page><page sequence="19">THE INEFFABLE-BEN-HORIN 339 is to stand for a not-to-be. The real question is not "to stand for or not to stand for" but to stand for something or to stand for nothing. Heschel actually suggests that "I am that I am not" (pp. 47-48) which is the same as suggest- ing that to be is either not to stand for or to stand for nothing. In either case an ominous relation between mysticism and totalitarianism becomes visible: the former idealizes the continuity and eventually the identity of being and non-being; the latter realizes this ideal in mass- extermination.32 One is tempted to identify the two sys- tems as theoretical and practical non- or nexistentialism which condemns Being to stand for Non-Being and urges humanity to stand for inhumanities. Now granting for a moment that "supremacy" etc. are indications, we come upon a second difficulty with the claim of the "ineffable's" superiority over mind. For in that case, the "ineffable's" superiority over our minds rests on its ability to communicate not knowledge but "indications." If so, it must be asked whether "knowledge of [the in- effable's] reality" (p. 32) is an "indication" or whether it is knowledge "known to all men" (p. 21) which, incidentally, requires little further reiteration. If "the sense of the ineffable" can communicate merely indications, its super- iority over mind is not established. And if these "indica- tions" are of the category of vapid tumidities - here "supremacy," "grandeur," elsewhere "transcendent preci- ousness that surpasses our power of appreciation, and of 32 "The word Sum," [I am] said Eckhart long ago, "can be spoken by no creature but by God only: for it becomes the creature to testify of itself Non Sum." (Quoted in E. Underhill, op. cit., p. 5, n. 1.) One might follow through with cogito ergo non-sum. Alfred Rosenberg, Hitler's philosopher, took Meister Eckhart seriously (see his Mythus des XX. Jahrhunderts, Muenchen, 1940, 166th edition, pp. 216 ff.) and became one of the architects of what Churchill has called "a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime." See Section V, below.</page><page sequence="20">340 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW which our highest values are but a faint indication" (p. 29) or "the totality of a thing [being] actual infinity" (p. 31) or "the majesty of that which is more than the universe" (p. 31) - then the "ineffable's" superiority is inferior indeed. For mind implies possession of knowledge of the actual behavior of actual things or events rather than the possession of indications or not more than a sense of a thing's "actual (!) infinity." Mind is a kind of conduct which denotes power to control natural existences for human purposes. The allegation of its inferiority to "the ineffable [which] is conceivable in spite of its being un- knowable" (p. 32) is an attempt to replace the scientist's laboratory by the magician's cauldron and Pythia's elusive ejaculations. Nor is the superiority of the ineffable capable of restoration by such metalogical histrionics as the claim that, on the one hand, "the sense of the ineffable" com- municates to us "the knowledge of its reality" (p. 32) while on the other, eight lines down, "the ineffable is... unknowable." IV The third difficulty with the "ineffable's" superiority over our minds emerges from the declaration that radical amazement or "wonder rather than doubt is the root of all knowledge." (p. 11) In the first place, it will not be regarded as intellectually respectable to insist on the following two propositions simultaneously: 1) "Radical amazement... is the root of knowledge"; (p. 11) 2) "Our radical amazement is en- hanced ... by the advancement of knowledge" and "science extends... the scope of the ineffable." (p. 30) For if knowledge enhances our radical amazement, if our amaze- ment is either not yet radical enough or our radicalism not sufficiently amazing, it - knowledge - is rather the root</page><page sequence="21">THE INEFFABLE-BEN-HORIN 341 of what eventually may become a fully radical amazement, and doubt may be safely restored to the honorable position of "root of knowledge," a position honored for example by the experimentalist. If science extends the ineffable's scope, it must be assumed that the ineffable is rather limited in scope, for science which extends it is limited enough. Also, it is difficult to see how that which is en- hanced by science is superior to mind, the originator of science, much as it remains obscure how "supremacy" and "grandeur" attach to a now rather circumscribed reality called the "ineffable." It is difficult to be convinced that wonder or the knowl- edge of the ineffable as communicated by the sense of the ineffable (p. 32) can be the root of knowledge when "knowl- edge" is not once again "knowledge of the ineffable" but rather is an ongoing process from actually felt ignorance to hypothesis to verification to correction to new hypothesis. Wonder and amazement are self-perpetuating. They move from wonder to amazement to wonder to amazement to wonder. Knowledge is irrelevant to them as they are to knowledge. Science and art are ways of improving human experience by being kinds of human experience already improved through accumulated values and objects. Wonder and amazement have no such purpose: "We are amazed at seeing anything at all; amazed not at particular values and things but at the unexpectedness of being as such, at the fact that there is a being at all." (p. 12) Amazement is not concerned with either values or things which constitute the stuff of improvable human experience. It is quite incapable to do duty as root of human knowledge which, whether amazed at itself or not, hardly begins, pauses or ends with such "amazement." "If we must know," says Heschel in one of his "amazing" pseudotruisms, "in order to question, if we must entertain</page><page sequence="22">342 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW a belief in order to cast doubt upon it, then doubt cannot be the beginning of knowledge." (p. 12) It is of course true that knowledge underlies further knowledge as it underlies doubt. Thales thought that a lodestone possessed a soul because it could move a piece of iron. To doubt this one needs first to know that the lodestone moves iron, that iron does not move by itself, that souls are capable of moving it, that Thales thought so etc. Doubt is the impulse to seek knowledge based on the hypothesis that available knowledge fails to account for the phenomena in focus. The truth is that neither doubt nor knowledge are "roots of knowledge." Man in his interaction with the world creates the means for better interaction. This man-world "conver- sation" is the root of wisdom, science, art, value, meaning, -all parts of that cumulative process called culture. While we must know in order to doubt, know less well in order to know better, we must not know at all in order to "wonder." Heschel rejects doubt as root of knowledge because doubt implies preceding knowledge, however lim- ited. He postulates wonder as the root because, clearly, wonder implies preceding ignorance, however unlimited. Wonder is rooted in "higher ignorance" which is absolute ignorance. Wonder is radical stupefaction. It is the root not of knowledge and civilization but of that radical fanaticism which, in turn, is the root of totalitarianism. A fourth difficulty with the argument for the ineffable's superiority over our minds is the matter of its originality and unconventionality. "The greatest hindrance to knowl- edge is our adjustment to conventional notions, to mental cliches." (p. 11) 3a 32a Father Edward A. Synan ("Abraham Heschel and Prayer," The Bridge-A Yearbook of Judaeo-Christian Studies [J. M. Oester- reicher, editor], New York, Pantheon Books, 1955, pp. 256-265) writes: "Heschel [in Man's Quest for God] insists on the negative character of</page><page sequence="23">THE INEFFABLE-BEN-HORIN 343 This is obviously true when by "adjustment" one means uncritical acceptance of tradition, sheer sycophancy to antiquity and established prestige. It is palpably false if such an "adjustment" is imputed to man's creative intel- ligence. The history of science is hardly a history of such "adjustment." "The scientific method is essentially a means of discovering new phenomena, and of formulating new theories, so that the sciences constitute ever-expanding systems of knowledge, old theories being overthrown con- stantly by new ones, so long as the method is practiced."33 Actually, conformist adjustment is the province of mysti- cism rather than of science. As a supernaturalist doctrine, mysticism is a version of orthodoxy in personal and in group conduct. This still holds true when it degenerates into teaching "salvation through sin" which, after all, is be- havior of a still older conventionality and orthodoxy. When Heschel recommends piety as "compliance with destiny, the only life worth living," (p. 278) he is engaged in nothing but the propagation of "adjustment to conventional no- tions" and the enunciation of "mental cliches" which are our grasp of the ineffable God so strongly, however, that in principle it would seem that for him no theology remains possible at all. But, inadequate though our concepts of God be, they are true; when Heschel says that in the face of God's reality 'all concepts become cliches,' he falls into a trap of his own making." With reference to Heschel's efforts to explain away all earthly utility from prayer, the chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Seton Hall University continues: "Worse yet, in Heschel's theology, God 'needs' us. In some way God is said to benefit by our prayers; His knowledge is 'augmented' - He comes to know us, the world enters the orbit of His intention. No dialogue,' prayer is a device for a kind of expansion of God. Difficult, to think that here Heschel's pen has not somewhat outrun his intent, that his delight in the freshly minted term has not led him to strike off what may be no coin at all. Are such expressions tolerable? Is there some sense in which they do not diminish the full independence of God?" 33 S. F. Mason, Main Currents of Scientific Thought (New York: Schuman, 1953), p. 491.</page><page sequence="24">344 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW greater hindrances to worthwhile knowledge than the spirit of experimental inquiry. The "religious man [who] discerns the original beneath the palimpsests of things" (p. 37) discerns nothing but the worn palimpsest of mystic-orthodox pseudo-originality, much as Heschel finds nothing but "the ineffable" behind the genius of man. Hardly is there a mal- adjustment to conventional notions when he pronounces this blatant inexactitude: "To assert that the most sensitive minds of all ages were victims of an illusion; that religion, poetry, art, philosophy were the outcome of a self-deception is too sophisticated to be reasonable. Bringing discredit on the genius of man, such an assertion would, of course, dis- qualify our own minds for making any assertion." (p. 33) This appeal to authority is conventional. So is the misap- propriation of the terms "religion, poetry, art, philosophy" for orthodoxy and mysticism. The Hermes of Praxiteles is poor evidence for "the truth" in Fra Bartholomeo's Pietd or Matisse's Dance. The national anthems of Israel and, say, Germany, or the Nibelungen Lied and the poetry of Uri Zvi Greenberg, Israel's greatest living poet, are hardly one utterance to be either rejected as self-deception or glorified as ineffable truth. The philosophy of Karl Marx and Nikolai Lenin supports neither the philosophy of St. Augustine nor that of St. Thomas Aquinas. "Religion" is not the monopoly of either Baal Shem Tov or Eliyah of Wilna. The God of the Spanish Inquisition was not the God of the thirty thousand people burned at the notorious "acts of faith" or autos-da-fe. "The eternal and all-govern- ing father" whom St. Catherine of Siena 1347-1380) heard say, "'Those who are indignant at and rebel against the things that befall them are blind with self-love....

Heschel insists that the most ludicrous and perverse idols still point to "the sense of mystery implicit in the urge to produce and worship them": only the expression of this sense, when related to man's "conventional needs and ideas," leads to the idolator's error. (p. 33) His own "expressions" by im- plication are free of this weakness. Nonetheless, unless we cease to be human, we shall not divest ourselves of needs and ideas, both "conventional" and "conventional-to-be," and "idolatry" will forever cling to the "sense of mystery"37 because of our humanity. As long as we strive for expres- sion, as long as we live and act,38 mystics will cry, "Leper! Leper! Idolatry! Idolatry! Expression! Expression!" For one of our "conventional needs" is the need for fullest pos- sible expression, while the unconventional need of "the sense of the ineffable" is its fullest possible repression. And if expression, through word, tone, color, stone, gesture and 34 Paul de Jaegher, S.

(E. Underhill, op. cit., p. 27.) 38 According to Philo (Wolfson, Philo, II, p. 134), only God acts, all created things suffer action. From this it would follow with the logic of Heschel's-Eckhart's "I am that I am not" that "I do what I do not" or - to paraphrase Descartes - I am not, ergo I am, I do not, ergo I do. All of which supports the conclusion that mysticism's being is un-being, its doing is undoing - the undoing of man and society.</page><page sequence="26">346 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW action, is at the core of our being human, identification of expression and idolatry is humanly intolerable. A Tosefta (Meg. IV, 28) wisely observes that "many have preached about God's throne (Mekraba) and have never beheld it."38a This seeks to silence the arrogance of the unimaginative and the narrowly intellectual. But clearly the Tosefta does not confuse actualities and the musings of our hearts (cf. Babylonian Talmud, Meg. 24, 2). Many have claimed to have seen the invisible but none ever have seen and none ever will see it. Many have preached about the inaudible but none have ever heard it. For to see the invisible is to be blind and to hear the inaudible is to be deaf. Where Psalm 115 speaks of "ex- pressionist" idolators whose idols are manufactured with eyes, ears, hands etc. that do not function, anti-expression- ist mysticism postulates non-idolators who do not require eyes, ears, hands or any senses or, indeed, body and mind with "conventional needs and ideas" because these "non- idolators" possess the capacity to "sense" the ineffable senselessly. The Psalmist ridicules his idolator who sees that his god is blind; the mystic extols his non-idolator's blindness with which he beholds his God.39 Now this is not, as it may seem, a malicious caricature drawn by a misguided anti-mysticism.

His incorporeality was a result of the experience, since the music made him forget to eat for forty days (De Somniis, i, 36); he not only listened to the music, but he himself became a part of it. For it was on the mount that he came to "stand with" God, share His immutability (De Posteritate Caini, 28 f.; De Confusione Linguarum, 30-32; De Sacrificiis Abelis et Caini, 8). Hence his soul became a lyre.... By the fact that Moses could live so long upon the vision of divine things, and without material food, he showed his complete renunciation of the body.4I To make this point clear beyond doubt, Philo writes that Moses' death or "the perfect soul's translation over to Being" did not involve subtraction from or addition to his essence. Nor was Moses' soul aware of a change in status through death, "because at that moment it was in a state of inspired frenzy." Goodenough interprets that Moses' death did not involve a change of the essential Moses, for he was so purely divine as to be changeless. That is, the human element was so little a part of [Philo's] Moses that its loss was no change. He was merely restored to To On [Being]."42 Ineffabilism, whether in Philo, its father, or in Heschel, its latest protagonist, may boast of unconventionality only in the sense of predilection for dehumanized existence. At this point again totalitarianism emerges as mysticism's ultimate social expression. It is not a paradox at all that the rejection of man's expression ultimately expresses the 40 Wolfson, Philo, II, p. 113. 4' Erwin R.

Returning once more to Philo, we find him saying: "Our" minds are, like God's, light-centers, sending [mind rays] through "us" as the sun illumines the material universe. So long as this is going on we are "in ourselves" and so cannot be possessed [by ecstasy or divine inspiration]. But when the light of our minds "sets" there naturally then comes the state of ecstasy, enthusiasm, possession, mania. For when the divine light shines, the human light sets, and when the divine light sets, the human rises. (Quis rerum divinarum Heres, 263 f.)43 V The superfluity of man in mysticism is a foundation of totalitarian practice of mass extinction. This is the final upshot of the "unconventionality" of the distinctively mystical. Avvakum, a Russian preacher burnt at the stake in 1682 for opposing the correction in the church books of "Isus" to "Iisus" (Jesus), thundered: Take heed, you who listen to me: Our misfortune is inevitable, we cannot escape it. If God allows scandals, it is that the elect shall be revealed. Let them be burned, let them be purified, let them who have been tried be made manifest among you. Satan has obtained our radiant Russia from God, so that she may become crimson with the blood of martyrs. Well planned, devil.44 It was mysticism's "negative way" which welcomed the statement by St. Angela of Foligno (1248-1309) that, by the deaths of her mother, husband, and children, she was freed from "great obstacles in the way of God."45 Some six 43 Ibid., p. 382. 44 G.

To the extent that man is able to channel ecstasy into works of creative altruism, such ecstasy is one of the cosmopoetic powers of human nature. To the extent, however, that ecstasy issues in the evacuation of mind from mind,48 self from self, and meaning from meaning, to the 46 Gravity and Grace, trans. by Arthur Wills (New York: G. P.

The contradiction, however, to "expansion of our little ... egos to an unlimited divine self" is not serious. The effect alike of our reduction to zero and/or our inflation to infinity is dehumanization. 48 Sorokin, op. cit., pp. 363 f.: In the final, samadhi, stage of Raja Yoga techniques which resemble those of all mystical currents (p. 356)</page><page sequence="30">350 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW extent that it culminates in "filling" or "fulfilling" our finite forms with infinity, eternity, and absolute godhood- it constitutes the core of man's chaopoetic dispositions. The thesis advanced here, then, is that connecting links exist between the conception of the superfluity of men's bio-cultural functions and the postulate and the policy of their actual extermination. Standing "face to face" with recent experiences and current prospects of mass-self- effacement, this generation needs not just "agonizing re- appraisals" of power conditions but, more fundamentally, a reappraisal of man's mystical agonizings. For from the mystic's non sum of all creatures a readily traceable path seems to lead to the totalitarian's non sitis for, say, non-Aryans, non-conformists, and generally, "non- mystics." There can be little doubt about the interrelatedness of totalitarianism and mysticism in twentieth century Ger- many. According to the impressive record assembled by Rohan D'O. Butler, from the sixteenth to the present cen- tury, there stands behind a large segment of German thought the inspiration of the sense of Germanity, the "mystic omnicomprehensive whole of Deutschtum."49 Ruth- lessness derives from the serious attempt to realize absolute values. The divorce of the ideal from the individual ex- plains "the fanatical quality of German idealism and the interplay of nihilism and mysticism."50 The story of intellectual life in Weimar Germany provides further documentation for our general thesis. A reaction to the industrialization and mechanization of life had already "'the mind is in pure vacuity, so to say...'; Man becomes equal to God or Isvara." Meaning vanishes when, with Erigena, 'God himself does not know what He is, because God is not what' and "what" and all our categories of thought are judged to fail.

Defeat, inflation, and psychological tension after 1918 accentuated and exaggerated it. When secularization and technology were felt to have disenchanted and demystified the world, medieval mysticism and nine- teenth-century romanticism were invoked and at times reenforced by the wisdom literature of India and the Far East. As Professor Pinson summarizes it, there was a trend to the mystical and the occult, as evidenced in the anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner, the philosophy of Ludwig Klages, the revived interest in the mysticism of Meister Eckhart and Jacob Boehme and in the neo-Hasidism of Martin Buber. Above all, the post-war years saw the full flowering of a powerful neo- romanticism that revived the theories of the older ro- manticists of the early nineteenth century and refashioned them for an attack upon rationalist and liberal humani- tarian democracy exemplified by the republic.... Cath- olic, Protestant, and Jew vied with one another in pointing out how romanticism was peculiarly adapted to the German spirit and how it could solve the complex problems of post-war society. Anti-rationalist organismic theories of the state, anti-capitalist critiques of material- ism and economic individualism, revived nationalist xenophobia and ethnocentrism constructed upon reinter- pretation of Herder, Fichte and Hegel- all these com- bined with a scorn for logic and reason and an exaltation of the power of the unconscious and of intuition helped to develop a state of mind which became hostile to the liberal democracy of the republic. Words and concepts like Mythos and Schicksal became popular vehicles for making it easy to avoid facing the hard realities of concrete existence.5' 51 Koppel S.

According to a leading scholar in the field of Russian studies, an examination of the question of rationality and non- rationality in Russian and Soviet thought justifies the defense of these theses: First, rationality in Russian thought was rather poorly developed before the Revolution of 1917. Second, the level of rationality prevailing in Soviet thought is likewise low. Third, the cause of today's low level in Soviet thought is to be found in part in the underdevelop- ment of rationality in the years and even the centuries stretching back through the pre-revolutionary history of Russia. Thus, within the confines of organized religion, "from first to last, the Russian Church placed more em- phasis on mysticism, and less on intellectualism, than either the Catholics or the major Protestant communions of the West."54 Reason did not flourish among the Orthodox 52 Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (New York: Har- court, Brace &amp; Co., 1951), p. 172. 53 Ibid., pp. 431-432.

"Quite deliberately the Orthodox Church placed an overwhelming emphasis elsewhere - upon mystical religion."ss In the nineteenth century, Aleksei Khomiakov, "the father of lay theology in Russia," regarded rationalism as one of the greatest weaknesses of the West, including West- ern churches. He and other lay theologians boasted of the smaller role of rationality in the Russian Church.56 Vladimir S. Solov'ev (1853-1900), often called "the first Russian philosopher," ascribed to faith primary importance to which reason is secondary. In youth he saw bright visions of Sophia, the Wisdom of God, the Eternal Feminine, the Soul of the World. In later years Satan appeared before him in various forms. "There are some," concludes Professor Robinson, "who would say that only a deep mysticism can provide the final answer to the Communists. But others may hold that in going as far as it did in renouncing the world, the Russian Church may in some fashion have renounced it to Lenin."s7 "In Bolshevism," writes Edgar Alexander,58 "the old materialistic and sensualistic theocracy found its ultimate manifestation in entirely secularized form, in the neo- Russian technocracy. In this process of transformation nothing of the typically Russian peculiarities, embodied in the old theocratic order, needed to be scrapped. The basic difference is only that the naturalistic mysticism- of the sacred 'little mother earth' (matuschka zemlja), of the 'Russian Christ' and the folk-bound 'integral body of Christ' -was replaced as a formative principle by the 55 Ibid., p. 364. s6 Ibid., p. 366. 57 Ibid., p. 369.

Only the utilization of full-grown technology for the realization of the anti-humanistic tenets of mysticism "reducing the ego to zero" - has raised the menace of in- effabilist "meta-practice" to its adult stature. The totali- tarian methods of effacing men and minds and "conventional needs and ideas" are evidence for the destructive power of pre-atomic technology harnessed to "to be is not-to-be." As for the Atomic Age, the conjugation of, say, scientific electronics with ineffabilist "metatronics"6? is likely to produce effects which surpass the imagination of men who claim no knowledge of conditions beyond the realm of life. 59 In his final assessment of German and Russian totalitarianism, Pro- fessor George H. Sabine (A History of Political Theory [New York: Holt, 1948], p. 773) writes that even in their most abstract aspects the two philosophies "are not wholly diverse. For dialectics, even in the ma- terialist version that Marx gave it, is not without elements of mysticism and romanticism that are of a piece with the more violent irrationalism of the fascists." 60 See above, Section I. - "Metatron," in Jewish angelology, is an angel who caused another angel to announce before the Flood that God will destroy the world.
