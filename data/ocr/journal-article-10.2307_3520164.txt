<plain_text><page sequence="1">A.N. ANWER* Goya's Engraving's: Anatomy oJ A subversive Aesthetic TO WHAT EXTENT does an artist's creativeness consist in a major revolu- tion in form or technique ? Can technical innovation by itself mean anything in isolation from important developments in the artist's relationship with the meaning of life itself ? The searing intensities of Goya's aesthetic vision derive from a passionate Spanish temperament; but they stem no less from the vehemence of his social and moral responses. Critics have often traced the distinctive features of Goya's works to his personal suffering and isolation, imposed by deafness, and to a private world of macabre fantasies and nightmares. But this approach misses the essential point that it. is precisely Goya's moral fervour- his loathing and horror of what man has made of nman- that con- tributes to the power, depth and stature of his artistic output. We find in Goya's works a curious interplay between the roles of fantasy and imagination on the one hand, and reason on the other. Goya's moral and intellectual assumptions and concer'ns belong- despite significant dif- ferences-broadly to the age of reason; but his stylistic attributes reveal an affinity with the approaching Romantic dawn, with its emphasis on the for- mal articulation of intense experiential states and on the free flight of imagination conjuring up forms from inner visions and fantasies, in defiance of classically endorsed contours. Indeed Goya's artistic traits not only relate to late-eighteenth-and early-nineteenth-century post-classicism but also make him a forerunner of such twentieth-century tendencies as expressionism, surrealism and avant- garde tragi-comedy. There is" however, an important difference. Though shades of absurdism colour his manner and method, the ideological pre- mises and moral instincts of Goya are the very obverse of much modernist doctrine. Whereas the absurdist insists that man, in a very basic, metaphysi- cal sense, is an alien, a being isolated from outer reality which makes no sense to him, Goya- so his art suggests-considers the absurdities of the human predicament to be firmly rooted in a historically specific socio-cultural matrix. Goyats achievement is all the more remarkable for it is without pre- cedents in the artistic scenario of eighteenth-century Spain.

Charles IV had encouraged the importation of engraving into Spain and set up the Royal Calcography at Madrid with the motivating idea of disseminating prints which supported officially sanctioned value codes amidst a wider public, with an emnphasis on ornate miniatures and skillful calligraphy. Goya subverts this imitative, polite and enervated tradition with explosive violence. He hurls defiance at the slavish replicators of visible realitv and fashions a completely new idiom whose unique character depends upon its reLance on distortion as a mode of social and moral com- ment. Misshapen, exaggerated and animalistic variations on the human physiognomy and countenance permeate his graphic frames. Goya's art affords an inside view of the absurd, the radically strange, and the morally repugnant. As in Hogarth, but on an altogether different level, distortion becomes in Goya a way of perceiving the world as well as a strategy for adjudicating against it. In this sense Goya belongs to a great tradition of eighteenth-and nineteenth- century artists including Swift, Gogol, Dic- kens and Dostoyevski, in whom distortive treatment of the surface of reality combines witlh an intensely critical diagnostic realism of content. The black lines of an engraving serve Goya much better than the equipment of a florid colourist in his evocationi of the morally dark world which is condemned in his etchings. Goya's revolutionary formal mode grows hand in hand with a revolutionary content, vividly affirming the fact that significant advances in technique are usually coextensive with corresponding leaps in consciousness. The history of Goya'.s personal development as an etcher is a microcos- mic version of the history of engraving in Spain. Beginning with conventional imitations ofValesquez. Goya strikes out in a totally unprecedented direction in his four major series, The Caprices, The Disasters of War, Tauromachy and Dis- parates. Goya's breakthrough as an engraver betokens the democratisation of fine arts. Engraving is in the same relation to pictorial art as printing is to the written word: the respective developments of both took them out of the courts and salons and made art and letters available to an emerging popular public. Goya seizes the advantage offered by this process: the subject matter of pictorial art is emancipated from the norms and confines assigned to it by- ruling-class aesthetics and addresses the problems of common life. In 1792 Goya suffered a serious illness which left him deaf for life, a cir-. cumstance that was to transform his life and work, enhancing his sensitivity to the lot of those who live in misery, wretchedness and deprivation. It pro- ducod an increasing alienation from the elite world into which he had, by vii'. tue of his talent, graduated from his peasant origins. Returning to work after his illness, he seemed to have become an artist with a mission and a commit- ment. The result was a series of social satires which were published under the tide Te Caprices. Within a very short time, however, the prints had to te withdrawn after Goya incurred the ire of the Inquisition, so that early in hi</page><page sequence="3">46 SOCIAL SCIENTIST career Goya was established as an artist at variance with officialdom. Satire of the eighteenth century variety evokes an essentially conserva- tive form associated with the refined, decorous and witty lampoons of, say, Dryden and Pope. But in the hands of a Goya or a Swift satire is capable of attaining a corrosive intensity, whose characteristic feature is moral indigna- tion. It is this angry, radical facet of the satiric mode that takes shape in Goya's first series. In The Caprices he mercilessly lashes out at human follies and vices as (leviations from the path of reason, justice and enlightenment. Neither the 'foliies and vices' nor 'reason' imply abstract moral categories. Ferrari com- mits an error in concluding that Goya's awareness of folly, viciousness and unreason in human life produces a general, sweeping condemnation of "Man"2. Goya, I think, would decline to posit human nature as a peremptory anti absolute determination. In reply to the abstract problematic :What is human nature ? he would pose the concrete counter-question: whose nature do you mean, that of the oppressed or the oppressor ? The object of Goya's scathing indictment is not Man as a generalised entity, but the perversions of human nature and the absurdity of human conduct in the historically specific order of contemporary class society. Undoubtedly The Caprices attain universality as documents on the human condition in the ontological sense; but they refuse to divorce ontological issues from a concrete response to social phenomena. The Caprices untold as free, somewhat loose rhaphsodic musings-which nevertheless retain a unity of purpose-on such diverse themes as the idiocy of fashionable society, the falsehood of court culture, the incompetence of doctors and lawyers, the viciousness of the clergy, the inhumanity of thejudi- cial machinery and the stupidity of superstition, dwelling with bitterness on the fact of social and economic iniquity. Like Swift, Goya believes that man is an animal rationis capax- a creature capable of reason-but is appalled at the monstrosity, bestiality and irrationality which engage in a hostile dialogue with reason in the nature of man. "Fantasy abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters," writes Goya. "United with her she is the mother of all the arts and the source of their wonder."I The key to the organising concept of The Caprices is provided by an etching which depicts Goya asleep at his drawing table, while in the sur- rounding darkness lurk the phantasmagoric forms of bizarre, evil-looking creatures. Goya's caption explains: "The dream of reason produces monsters." Monstrosity, released by the slumber of human reason, had in Goya a subjective-psychological as well as an objective-social significance. A recurrent motif, which exemplifies the triumph of monsters over reason, is witchcraft. Goya ruthlessly strips the hold of prevailing superstitions and irrationalistic predilections on the contemporary Spanish mind. In his etchings the world of witchcraft, mythified by popular superstition, appears both absurd and sinister. The technique of distortion, so germain to Goya's method, undergoes sustained development in The Caprices. Animal imagery predominates: men</page><page sequence="4">GOYA'S ENGRAVINGS 47 merge into beasts, and beasts with symbolically anthropomorphic features signify the dehumanisation of man. Aristocrats, doctors, lawyers and priests assume the lineaments of asses. The artist in the service of the ruling class is portrayed as a court musician with a monkey's face performing for a luxuriat- ing ass who listens to the music with a soulful look, while hangers-on applaud the spectacle from a distance. But the metaphoric use of animalistic images has a definite social content: the grotesqueness and animality of human features denounce the hegemony of a bestial, perverted, sub-rational order in society. Some of the etchings darkly parody upper-class culture with its cults of fashion and romance. Goya presents an aristocrat receiving a pedicure; his toe-nail is etched in the shape of an exaggeratedly long and hooked claw, and repulsion is distinctly visible on the moorish face of the pedicurist. Such repulsion is not directed at some individual; its scope encompasses the ethos of an entire social class. The print entitled "Old Woman and a Gallant" depicts an old hag seated in a pose of mock regality; a genteel fop is bowing low before her. Despite the seeming deference with which he profers his attentions, his lowered face suggests slyness and, perhaps, derisive laughter. The old woman's long hooked nose, exaggerated chin and thin lips are reminiscent of Goya's witches; her expression is disdainful, vain and coquet- tish. The falsity of the aristocratic "higher love", mystified by the literature of courtly romance, but in fact based on the power of position and wealth, lies exposed in this superbly ironic engraving. The woman portrayed, incidental- ly, is a thinly disguised caricature of Queen Maria Luisa, which could possibly explain the exclusion of this plate from the published edition ot The Caprices. Another deliberation on the absurdity and vanity of fashion is the por- trait of an aristocratic old dame gazing into a mirror as she tries on a frilly bonnet. Her wizened features are exaggerated by the distortive quality of the mirror reflection. As usual, Goya imputes to the engraving a pithy, trenchant title that lends its irony a razor's edge. Entitled "Till death", the work operates on two levels; it is a philosophic reflection on the evanescent nature of human existence, as well as a caustic comment on the superficiality and absurdity of upper-class culture. Goya's penchant for invoking ultimate questions regarding life and death within a framework of cultural satire is likewise manifest in his portrayal of a genteel couple locked in an embrace; their exalted passion has literally consumed them-they are both dead. Such images of death related to the fashionable worl A function as metaphors for the decadence of aristocratic culture. We note an interesting ambivalence in Goya's treatment of erotic sub- jects: on the one hand he embraces the secularised, humanistic, moderm approach to sex as a normal, healthy, full-bodied human activity, in 'contrast to its prescription in the medieval Christian outlook; but on the other hand sexuality is linked in Goya's works with the degradation, perversion, com- mercialisation and alienation of man-woman relationships in the murky world of courts and salons. Marriages of convenience in elite society</page><page sequence="5">48 SOCIAL SCIENTIST definitively symbolised in the engraving which shows a blindfolded woman unseeingly giving her hand to the highest bidder, while in the background hover the naked, starved figures of the populace. Goya sums up the sexual mores of the upper-classes in a series of pictures which give graphic reality to the ubiquity of rape. But, as successive engravings demonstrate, rape is only the epitomal manifestation of a widespread ethic and attitude, revealed, for instance, in an etching titled "Dream of Inconstancy", which recreates the perverted libidinous fantasies of a well-fed debauche. Monks and priests are repeatedly caught in their gross, debauched and ridiculous moments. Their ascetic habits stand in an ironic relationship to the depravity of their sensualism. The depiction of their facial anatomy emphasises inner perversion: a priest's mouth opens in a leer revealing the blackness of a cavernous hole, relieved only by the dubious whiteness of pro- minent, misshapen teeth. Goya depicts a group of kneeling priests in an attitude of rapt devotion and piety. The object of their mindless adoration is a superior cleric who takes the shape of a parrot preaching from the elevation of a pulpit. The cryptic caption exclaims: "What a golden beak !" This denunciation of institutionalised religion is charged with allusions to the Spanish Inquisition, so deeply hated by the progressive intelligentsia at Madrid-a fact that earned Goya the animosity of the Holy Office. Goya's visual diatribe on abuses and social evils includes the theme of the education and the upbringing of the child. His treatment of the subject stems from an emerging enlightened approach to education which opposed the distortive effects of current pedagogic practices on the development of the human personality. We see a backward family obsequiously genuflecting before the teacher, entrusting a tiny infant to him. The fact of the teacher symbolises perversity, smugness and insensitivity- Goya makes plain that the education and socialisation of the child can, in such a situation, only be brutalising and degrading. A related plate focuses on the barbaric phenomenon of the battered child. A father is seen brutally lacerating his. son's bared hindparts with his boot, while the child howls in agony. The man grips the boy's shirt between his teeth as a token of his bestiality. Continuing the theme, plates from the same period as The Caprices, depict convicts incar- cerated in chains and shackles. Goya's condemnatory caption declares : "The custody is as barbarous as the crime." IJltimately The Caprices go beyond a criticisnm of isolated evils, abuses and institutions, and strike at the verv basis of class society-its fundamental injustice and exuloitativeness, its idolisation of monev, its innatelv contradic- tiory character, and its pervasive alienation. Goya grasps and repucdiates the very essense of a burgeoning bourgeois culture in which money, withi all its distortive power, is fast acquiring the statUs of a ruling deity. The image of a miser paranoically clutching and concealing his money bags in the etching titled "Why hide them ?" relates the traditional Christian strictures on avarice to the dehumanising ethic of possessive individualism in the modern bourgeois epoch. More disturbing is the engraving which Goya with dark humour calls "Tooth-searching". A woman has climbed a scaffold in order</page><page sequence="6">GOYA'S ENGRAVINGS 49 to extract a gold tooth fromr the mouth of a hanging corpse. Our moral res- ponse to the action is guided by the woman's own divided attitude and inner conflict. The expression of alarm and horror on her face represents not only a reaction to the physical fact of the corpse but also, arguably, to her own moral perversion- an interpretation corroborated by the fact that the woman has averted her face even as she gropes in the dead man's mouth, as if to avoid seeing her own deed. Ultimnate problemis are posed in this dark perception of the value system of a money-obsessed humanity which does not hesitate to make capital even out of death. Goya penetrates the fundamental contradictions of class society as he ruminates on its iniquities. An etching which eloquientlv articulates the stuf- ferings of the common people depicts two poor men bent under the weight of a pair of socially privileged asses. That the asses have in realitv an exter- nally 'human' form is revealed in comparable etching which portravs two ancient aristocrats astride the shoulders of oppressed human beings whose skull-like features pronounce their condition of death in life. Gova's caption-"What one does to another". Goya's calculatedly ambivalent style evokes an eloquent fusion of the absurd and the tragic. This is seen in an engravinig which reveals a lighi society beauty raising her skirt to inspect her stvlish shoe, while a penuriolis old woman, stares at this alien sight with eyes that bespeak wonder, perplex- ity and also resentment-at the strange order of the world. Thus The Caprices start out as reformative satirisations of individual evils and follies, but as the series progresses their scope is dilated to a point where Gova's absurdist perceptions question the rationality and moral acceptability of all established morality, religion and law, and hit at the very root of existing socio-economic relations. In The Caprices Goya has already arrived at a dim view of human poten- tialities as reflected in man's social existence. Goya is too chnscious of human reality to subscribe either to the confident rationalism of eighteenth-century neo-classicists and Encyclopaedists, or to the facile optirnisml and progress utopias of the Romantics a;nd the early bourgeois period in general. He is deeply disturbed by the yawning ga) that he finds existing between the idealistic Enlighteirnenit conception- of mrn's nattire andl the frighte-nirng form hulman 'essence' has taken in the course of its actual historical evolution. This pessimisnm about human nature is deepened and intensified in Gova's second series, The Disasters of WVar. The developnment fronm The Caprices to Te Disasters represents a transition from the acid but neverttieless witty world ot afire tO a nightmarish context of horror. Witlh Nicons invasion of Spain in 1808 Goya's hopes of a Spanish society proag,-ressing by the light otf reason collapsed abruptly. War emerges in Goya as the crystallised formn of mtan's collective savagery, a sort of endemic madness that incarnates the capitulation of reason in human social life. Goya etches like a man possessed, from a deeply felt compulsion td voice a protest against what he sees around him. "This I saw" declare his horrified captions,</page><page sequence="7">50 SOCIAL SCIENTIST "Ancd this too." When his servant asked him, "Why do-you paint these bar- barities that men commit ?" Gova replied, "To tell men forever that they should not he barbarians."' Gova and his rationalist friends, who had been inspired by the pro- gressive ideas of the French Encyclopaedists, felt depressed and bitter at the fact that the French had now embarked upon the road of imperial expansion and global domination under the leadership of a dictator. Goya's engravings and canvases comnmemorate his "burning desire to perpetuate by nleans of the brush the most notable and heroic actions and scenes of our glorious insurrection against the tyrant of Europe.", What is noteworthy is Goya's sUs- tained avoidiance of anv lionisation of the official Spanish army. His only heroes are the courageous ordinary nmen and women who carried on their desperate but gloriouis guierrilla war, almost unarmed, in face of the overwhelminglv stuperior forces of the invader. Gova is totallv free of narrow chau'vinism; but his plates are vitalised bv a fervent nationalistic sentiment based on a passionate love of liberty, and he upholds the validitv of exterminiating such an adversary in his etching depict- ing a Spanish mob dragging a French officer's body by a rope. Goya gives his unflinching judgement: "He deservedi it !" While honourinig it, Gya steers clear of any romanticisation of the Spanish resistance: the war is depicted as a bloody affair throughout. But he does not subscribe to a simplistic and moralistic pacifism. From his engravings it is plain that violence can be resisted, unfortunately, only by violence, that non-resistance to evil only compounds it, that in a struggle such as this the man of conscience, if he is to be true to himself, is compelled to take sides. Gova's moral judgement-which, given the social background of a middle-class artist and intellectual of his time, is remarkably radical-is implicit in the way he sees the conflicting forces. This comes through power- fullv in the famous engraving which depicts a pair of Spanish peasants con- fronting the might of superior militarv technology with their weak and primitive weapons. Goya's picture has grasped the historic significance of this encounter. The moral and ideological stand of this work flows from the tension between sticks and guns, between spontaneous resistance and organised terror. But the dominant mood of The Disasters is not celebrative; it is an amalgamation of desolation, lamentation, and naked fury. Goya's impres- sioIns of war conme througAh as a number of staccato utterances that cohere in 'the totality of a terrible montage- in which the artist graphically docunments the despoiliation and devastation of an entire people. The series opens on an insidiously quiiet note with a plate entitled "Sad presentinments of whiat nmuist come to pass." In the centre of the picture Goya hasportrayed at manii in tattered clothes, kneeling, hands held in a gesture denioting despair anid lhopelessness. His eyes are cast up towards the skv, as thoutg lie apl)rehleneds some terrible blow from above. Much of the power of thie print lies in Gova's stuggestive use of thechiaroscuro effect: the illuminated figutreohi lhe m lan is suirrouinded bv menacing, hazy shadows which contain a</page><page sequence="8">GOYA'S ENGRAVINGS 51 sinister suggestion of nameless monsters peering out of the darkness at their designated victim. This is followed by forty-six plates illustratinig the atrocities of man's internecine violence, and another six on the devastating famine that ensued during wartime. The tragedy of human loss becomes intensely meaningful for the viewer through its personal significance for someone in the engraving-an orphaned child, a bereaved mother, sister or husband. Faith- shattering images make palpable man's limitless talent for collective crueltv. "Why ?" such things should happen. The claim ot man to reason and humanity has been jettisoned and finally lost in purposeless but organised ferocity. The high degree of orches- tration, cerebration and discipline needed in modern warfare-a degree of organisation of which only the 'social' and 'rational' being called man is capable- appears in Gova's plates in perplexing contradiction with bestialitv and mindlessness. The plate, "Heroic deeds! Against dead men !", shows a landscape withi mutilated corpses. From a branch of a tree hangs the naked inverted body of man, like a carcass in a btutchers shop. The arms a.nd the head have been h&lt;ac- ked and decoratively arranged on a nearby branch. The amputated hutman body has an equivalent in the truincated branches of the stark, desolate tree: men and trees have been subjected to,a parallel devastation. The static power of Picasso's Guernica pales beside these images of the disrnembernment of the human personalitv. The overarching sense of the madness of war is encapsulated in the plate titled "Ravages of War". Gova depicts a room littered with objects and htuman bodies, among them the corpse of a beautiful womanl, raped before being murdered. From somewhere above a human figure and a chair hturtie downward to complete this comprehensive imi'age of radlical chaos in human life. One manifestation of war's moral chaos is the perpetration of atrocities on women. Goya's engravings reveal something of his attitude to how one faces the existence of evil in the world. He does not present women as the passive victinms of their persecutors' rapacity; instead they are revealed in active, necessarily violent resistance of the brutissh embraces of the invaders. Goya's captions express the fighting attitude of his women protagonists: "They do nlot wai,- to... Nor thev... Nor these." And in the i-bspired Ktching titled "What Courage" Goya pays homiiage to the iianaeless hleroes alnd heroines of the Spanisth resistance through 1-his depiction of a lonie womiiani fir- ing a cannon after all thie gunneIs lhave been killcdi arotindi lher.

"Nothiing"</page><page sequence="9">52 SOCIAL SCIENTIST implies a resolute deni-al of the consolatory notion of an after-life and a melancholy reflection on the meaninglessness and futility of war. Death is the terminal riddle of human existence, the unfathomable universal potentiality for non-being immanent in all manifestations of life. But the phenomenon of death also implies for Goya those social and historical forces which abrogate life and proliferate death. War, portrayed in one of the plates as the looming darkness of a "carnivorous vulture", is identified as the predator of life and the destroyer of meaning, leaving in its- wake only the vacuity of nothingness. Goya's conception is by no means nihilistic. There ultimately exists a rich positive relationship between Goya's apprehension of the nullity implied by death and his catechism of life-destroying forces. His preoccupa- tion with death and the forces of death gains meaning and significance pre- cisely because its opposite, life, is the ultimate criterion of meaning affirmed by his art. The war ended with the triumph of reaction in Spain. Ferdinand, who had stooped to exhibitions of utter sycophancy to the French Emperor and had declared his desire to become "the adoptive son of H.M. the Emperor""' now returned to power. Sapin was resubjugated to a regime of repression and terror which crushed protest, purged liberals (incluiding Goya), and resorted to a policy of systematic persecution of the forces of protest. Goya, now 65 and stone deaf, left Madrid for Piedrahita en route to the Portuguese border with the declared -"intention of making (his) way to a free country".7 The Minister of Police threatened to impound the property. of Goya's entire family if he did not return immediately and he was left with no alternative but to comply for the inoment. Later he decided to flee to France; leaving behind the plates of The Disasters of War which remained unpublished during his lifetime. T-he experience of the war and the reign of terror further radicalized Goya's sensibility. War and death are now apprehended as integral conm- ponents of a total power structure, a whole unjust scheme of things. Goya's images assault the guignolesque masters of an oppressive state machinery, including the Church which actively connived in the reprisals against the liberals and radicals. A plate indicting all those forces which are "contrarv to the general interest" depicts a diabolic figure inscribing edicts in a calender of laws. Through such images Goya delivers his comment on the demonism of the ruling powers. The people are coerced to bow before monstrous new masters, portrayed as beasts of prey. We see the people kneeling to a wolfwho writes the contemptuous taunt: "Wretched humanity the fault is yours." Like the alienating device in a Brechtian play, the edict conveys an unimistak- able message: if the people are governed by oppressive and brutal masters, th-ev are themselves to blame for accepting this subjugation. Goya repeatedlv voices exhortationis against passive suffering; in one plate of a waif who, like some insubstantial apparition, extends his hand for alms, Goya says brieflv: "The worst is to beg." Pe-haps the most mnoving as well as ideologically perceptive of these pic-</page><page sequence="10">GOYA'S ENGRAVINGS 53 torial essays on poverty, hunian suffering and social discrimination, is a plate which depicts a hollow-cheeked men bewailing his dead relations as a pair of aristocrats regard the spectacle with aloofness and contempt. Their attitude to their wretched fellow-human is conveyed bv the ironical, caption: "Do they belong to a different ?" In Goya's engraving, an unbr4dgeable abyss separates the poor man from the alienating eyes of the affluent duo who view him and his dead family with a gaze that fails to acknowledge their common humanity. Goya's humanistic conviction of the indissoluble bond that con- nects one humaii being with another is the implicit counterblast to this dehumanised philosophy which rationalises the degradation, exploitation and even extermination of a subject race or class by questioning its very claim to humanity. Goya's etchings thus reveal in their analvsis of social!phenomena a degree of radicalism that goes far beyond the liberal progressivism of the middle-class rationalists in contemporary Madrid, testifying that.the artist's "hunger for truth" (Lukacs) often leads to insights which are inexplicable in terms of the artist's overt ideological framework. By the ena of the war Goya was adeeply disillusioned man. Reaction had triumphed, liberty was dead and truth was fraught with danger. Man's nature had been exposed in a frightening, subhuman aspect. The last prints in 7he Disasters despondently attempt to come to terms with a world in which a "Fierce monster" devours the tiny limbs and bones of human children, a world in which, as one of the last plates allegorises, humanity gazes at the spectacle of "Truth", in the guise of a woman, lying dead. Yet, amazingly, even after all that he has seen, suffered and damned, Goya does not abandon the precarious hope of reason and humanity prevailing in the end. Even as he pronouinces the death of Truth, he wonders expectantly: "Will she rise again ?" And the concluding cadenza of this grtuesomne svmphony is beatific arid serene. An etching titled "This is the truth" opens a window on Goya's visionary (and some would say unrealistic) ideal. Truth, once again per- sonified as a worman, has been resurrected. She points out the path of peace, work and harmony to a peasant who holds in his hand the spade which denotes his activity as a labourer. A sheep gazes benignly at this pacific pas- toral scene as the sun lights up the skv to adumbrate the mood of hope and affirnmation. Thus, though Goya of The Disasters is pessimistic investigator of the bar- baritv and irrationality of man as a social animal, his negative judgements are nowhere actuated by misanthropy. As in the case of Swift, Gova's loathing and horror emanates from a profoundly humanistic impulse to retrieve men from the mad course on which he has embarked and restore to him the rationality, dignity and nobility of which he is capable. The prevailing political climate after the end of the war was inhibitive to an art of direct ideological statement. In the third phase of his activitv as ani etcher Goya, by now 68, sought refuge in a safe theme: Tauromachy, the traditional Spanish art-of bull fighting. Some of the plates seem matter of fact or even glorificatory of this national sport. In anv case the motifs of blood and</page><page sequence="11">54 SOCIAL SCIENTIST death conitintue to haunt Gova's imagination in these depictions of expert matadors and possessed nmobs lancing to death the reckless beast who never stands a chance in this u-nequal conflict between brain and brawn. The same effect is generated by the etching entitled "The dogs let loose on the btull." The only thing comparable to the effect produiced here in the work of Gova's contemporary compatriots is the engraving by Amletller-inclulded in the National Gallerv exhibition-nanmed "The huinting of an ostrich" which vividlv etchles the crazed joy gleaming in the eyes of a groutp of people com- peting to be thie slayers of a terrorised bird. In his final phlase-perhaps the most complex and enigmatic in his development as an engraver-Gova creates a world which eludes definitive formulation. The series is entitled Disparates. The Spanish word Disparates connotes folly, absurditv, insanitv. Gova, who began with reason as his point of departure, nowk, gravitates towards its very opposite a- he explores a shadowy world of demonism, absurdity and nadness. Gova's intellectual dilemma at this point of his development illustrates the paradoxical situation wherein the ascendancv of the world-view of reason, espoused by the emergent bourgeoisie is iunidermined in practice by the same bourgeois world with, on the one hand, the breakdown of the traditional fideistic con- ceptiOn of life, and, on the other, the spread of irrationalism, violence and contradictions in actual humnan social existence. Goya involves his audience in his privileged insight into the world of destructive monsters, terrors and unreason which was coming into being in his lifetime, and which he com- prehlenlded with prophetic foresight. We who live in times when the whole ihunman race can, in a moment, be annihilated by a lunatic pushing a button, are the inheritors of this apocalyptic prophecy. How do we grasp the meaning of the elusive Disparates ? Do we simply give up the struggle even before embarking upon it, by declaring with Ferrari that these works are great because no meaning can be read into them ? Yet Ferrari contradicts himself in the same breath by reading a definite meaning into the Disparates, which he believes to be a case of the disillusioned, tired and aged artist escaping "from the painful world of reality into an asylum in the world of dream."' Arguing along similar lines, the American critic Richard Schikel sees the Disparates as a turning away from objective reality into an essentially "private -hell,"' a tortured inner world of suibjective chaos and psvchopathology. Such interpretations, though they contain an element of truth, are considerably reductive of the complexity with which the Dis- parates operate on many levels. They totally fail to recognise the social respon- siveness whicih, far from being absent from these supposedly "subjective" works, is the precise force behind their mnoral energy. A glance at-the historical context in which Goya created these conclud- ing masterpieces helps in elucidating their meaning. Spain, which had resis- ted a foreign invader at a terrible cost, now lay under the shadow of tvranny at home. The rationalist intellectuals who had befriended Goya in better times were all in exile and the kingwas suirrounding himself with lackevs and reac- tionaries whose raison d'etre was to vindicate and uphold an anachronistic absolutist regime. Against this background, folly, absurditv and insanity</page><page sequence="12">GOYA'S ENGRAVINGS 55 crvstallise in Goya's works as the all-enmbracing ethos of contenmporary social conditions. Openlv political art is impossible in this atmosphere of cen- sorship and persecution. In suich a situation how else would the artist assauilt the existing state of affairs but through a strategy of indirection ? Thus, while it is true that the Disparates descend into dark, antemosaic recesses of humnan consciousness, the fact remains that Goya's preoccuipation with the irrational is at the same time his way of mnilitating against the absurditv of existence in a real historical environment. Intimations of social absurditv in the Disparates resolve into a perception of the world as the abode of madness. The bizarre ambience evoked here proclaims the ad absurdum of a world of surreal, pre- posterous and contradictory relationships. Goya's earlier proposition (that the dream of reason produces monsters) remains the controlling idea in these works too. Mankind has abandoned reason. The notion of madness which predominates in Disparates, as is borne out by several of the engravings, has a manifest social sigrnificance. Consider for example the etching "Folly of Fear." We see a group of people grovelling in thc mud. The source of their terror is twofold-: the military officer to the right whose raised sword threatens and, on the left, the looming, gigantic, ghost-like figure in a hooded shroud, who descends upon them in a scene that expresses the paranoia of a nightmare. Another equally violent illustra- tion which looks back to the Disasters, portrays a Frenchman trampling a man with his boots. The quality of the imagery in many of these plates-with their subtle suggestion of unreal faritasms lurking in the shades, and their use of visuals to evoke a sense of unearthly terror and of uncontrolled violence simmering just beneath a deceptively quiet surface-make Goya a precursor of sur- realism as well as modem cinema Moreover, such effects are not mere technical tours deforce; they are the vehicles of Goya's intuitional as well as philosophic response to the monstrous irrationality and violence that reside deep in the soul of man. "Pure madness" brings palpably to life a world of howling creatures and delirious orgies which epitomises the dark side of religion in an image of monks threatening a kneeling wretch with the fires of Hell. "General folly," summing up the social criticism of the Disparates, projects an inclusive image of the whole human race gone mad. The notion of insanity is exploited within a complex, double-edged con- ceptual structure. On the one hand the frenzies and deliriums of the mad serve as metaphors for unreason in human social life. But on the other hand madness also has a positive value as a form of protest against restrictive superstructural constructs, an assertion of freedom from the frequently spurious rationality of the classical age, which, as emerge in Foucault, was often nothing but a rationale for a hierarchical, absolutist and oppressive status quo. Madness in Disparates is, at one and the same time, a symptom and symbol of insane objective conditions, an inward refuge from the horrors oi the outside world, and a revolt against the hegemonic domination of an officially sponsored rationalism. Goya violendy negates the polite, decorous</page><page sequence="13">56 SOCIAL SCIENTIST and orderly worlci mythitied as an age of reason, and exposes the hollowness of this self-image of the eighteenth century. Goya's preoccupations in Disparates are integral to a wider phenomenon: the paradoxical problem of the obsessive engagement with madness in the discourse of the age of reason. "' The wide incidence of mental breakdown amongst intellectuals of this period is no coincidence. Medical insanity, as modern statistical research indicates, is not merely a matter of the disintegration of the subjective unity of the individual qua individual, but is often directly proportional to loss of cohesion and adjustment in the outer world of social interactions and relationships, reaching a peak in periods of severe crisis such as world wars. The eighteenth-century phenomenon is a pointer to the fact that the birth pangs of the bourgeois world are sym- bolically subsumed within the ambience of widespread neurosis. The binary opposition of 'reason' and 'madness', carried implications that were not so much ideal as ideological. As Hart suggests in The Psychology of Insanity, and as Foucault's findings in Madness and Civilization convincingly substantiate, the classical age viewed madness within a "political conception."'' Neo-classieal culture ultimately derived its values of regularity and obedience to rules in all walks of life, via Boileau, from the authoritarian model of Louis XIV's regime in France. Madness, enthusiasm and excess stood at the outer edge of this polite and proper world, as a refusal to conform to its norms and constraints. The adherents of the light of reason saw madness as a realm of inscrutable darkness-a darkness linked with irreligion, satanism and licentiousness. The delirious frenzies of the madman bespoke a spirit of liberated animality. Defying accepted rationality, he chose to pursue the rhetoric of a-private logic. His delusions reflected dangerous aspirations: the mad man often declared that he was the king. There was in this period an indissoluble link between madness, poverty, idleness and discontent. Hence, in the age of reason the classic response to and solution of the problem of madness was confinement. Madmen, indigents, libertines, criminals and political troublemakers were clubbed together in a world of dungeons and chains. This stratagem made discontent invisible. It also provided cheap labour in times of crisis, since duty and moral obligation here took the form of an insis- tence on universal productivity. The madman distinguished himself from the other outcasts of society by his refusal even in the asylum to fall in with the work-schedule of this forced labour camp. Christopher Hill, E.P. Thompson and Foucault have shown how, in different contexts, madness was a form of protest in the age of reason, and that many of the foremost radicals used madness and prophecy as a cloak in the manner of Hamlet. Against this background in which neo-classical intellectuals like Dryden, Swift and Johnson equated madness with popular rule and insurrection, and a poet like Blake appropriated the credo of mad- ness to confound and overturn establishment conceptions of reason, moralitv and law, as well as the structures of authority they sustained, we may appreciate the full significance of Goya's Disparates. Let us consider, for instance, the engraving titled "A madness of the poor".

Mediating dialectically between tuiese two extremities of the social ladder is a poor woman dancing with bared breasts in a stance which expresses jubilation and abandonment. Here is a vibrant image of those underprivileged individuals who have torn asunder the shackles of officially prescribed orderliness, and whose spirited defiance provides an exemplar to other members of their social class. Several of the 'madness' engravings demonstrate not only the horror and darkness, but also laughter and fun. The framne of the engraving "Merrv Madness" is filled by happy, rejoicing people holding hands and dancing in a circle- the geometrical figure which is traditionally emblematic of concord, and whichi occurs in so many of Goya's works. The etching entitled "Carnival Madness" depicts a gathering of common folk watching with absorption the antics of a dancing duo who are performing in characteristic carnival masks. The merriment, conviviality and good-fellowship embodied in the scene recall Bakhtin's observations on carnivals, animal epics and laughter, in which he identifies the significance of laughter in folk culture as a means of combating the concepts, images, symbols and discipline of ruling cla-ss cul- ture. "Laughter", writes Bakhtin, "overcomes fear, for it knows no inhibition, no limitations. Its idiom is never used by violence and authority. (It) is the social consciousness of all the people (signifying) the defeat of power, of earthly kings, of the earthly upper classes, of all that oppresses and restricts." The trio of madness, spontaneity and laughter functions as a negatory protest against ruling-class "reason". But it also constitutes a positive alterna- tive weltenschauung which acquires special meaning given the historical con- text of spontaneous popular uprisings all over Europe in this entire period from the 1 76Os right upto 1848, with the concomitant ascendancv of a cul- ture from below. Thus we find Goya rejecting the ideological premises of a "high art" which prides itself in its separation from "low brow" entertain- ment forms, and drawing on popular cultural sources to invigorate, enrich and democratise his art. Near the end of his life Goya created a wonderful lithograph called "The Andalusian Dance" which celebrates the vibrance, zest and sheerjoie de vivre embodied in the haunting flamenco music and dancing of the freedom-loving Spanish gypsies. A work such as this testifies by its marked contrast to the sombre, grim and bizarre projections'which pervade much of his artistic output, that Goya's crusade against human bar- barism, injustice and unreason is actuated not as Ferrari supposes by a hatred of Man ingenere, but precisely by his faith in thejoy and beauty which life can attain, and by his ardent committment to what he would term 'humanity'.
