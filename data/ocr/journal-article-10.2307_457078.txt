<plain_text><page sequence="1">XI.-THE THEME OF PARADISE LOST Lovers of Milton's poetry occasionally note with regret signs that his great epic is losing its influenee upon the mind of the race. Hence, any attempt to. revive interest in Paradise Lost deserves the sympathetic attention of students of literature. Such an attempt is the article of Professor E. N. S. Thompson, The Thene of Paradizse Lost, printed in the Publications of the Modern Language Association, March, 1913. As I venture to differ from the writer, however, in a number of important particu- lars, I shall attempt to formulate what seems a more com- prehensive view of the meaning of Mlilton's epic. But before undertaking this, it might be profitable to consider some of the representative views of scholars and critics; for Paradise Lost has been the subject of a vast body of critical writing, and opinions have beeii expressed almost as varied as those upon Hamlet. The most widely accepted, and what was for a long time the orthodox theory, is that Paradise Lost is a theological and historical epic, dealing with human anid super-human facts, its action beginning before the creation, and endiilg with the disposition of things for eternity. Its central conceptions are the truths of Christianity, represented with splendor of language, and in certain portions with wealth of poetic ornament. The attitude of earlier critics who accepted this view was, in the main, one of unstinted admiration. Dennis and Addison may be taken as repre- sentatives. Even Dr. Johnson, who was bitterly opposed to Milton on the subject of politics, and out of sympathy with many of the traits of his character, yet reverenced 256</page><page sequence="2">THE THEME OF PARADISE LOST 257 his achievement in Paradise Lost, and mentioned as an undisputed fact that ' the substance of the narrative is truth.' But with the nineteenth century there came a different view of the universe. Biblical criticism and the advance of scientific knowledge made it impossible for many to ac- cept as literal truth the Biblical account of the creation and the fall. The matter of Paradise Lost is consequently to be discarded, and the fame of the poem is to rest upon the sublimity and harmony of its style. The chief repre- sentative of this class of critics is Edmond Scherer. Another variety of the critical opinion which considers that in substance Paradise Lost is theological and histori- cal is found in Mark Pattison's work on Milton. 'iMil- ton's mental constitution, then, demanded in the material upon which it was to work, a combination of qualities such as very few subjects could offer. The events and person- ages must be real and substantial, for he could not occupy himself seriously with. airy nothings and creatures of pure fancy. Yet they must not be such events and personages as history had portrayed to us with well-knowm characters, and all their virtues, faults, foibles, and peculiarities. And, lastly, it was requisite that they should be the com- mon property and the familiar interest of a wide circle of English readers.' 1 Again, 'The world of Paradise Lost is an ideal, con- ventional world, quite as much as the world of the Arabian Nights, or the world of the chivalrous romance, or that of the pastoral novel. Not only dramatic, but all, poetry is founded on illusion. We must, though it be but for the moment, suppose it true. We must be transported out of the actual world into that world in which the given scene 1 Pattison's Milton, p. 177.</page><page sequence="3">258 H. W. PECK is laid.' 2 The inconsistency in these passages is signifi- cant; the writer seems to be following two divergent paths, historical accuracy, and purely literary appreciation. A second class of critics, who believe that the Biblical account of the creation and the fall is a myth, yet who have been deeply impressed by the grandeur of Milton's epic, have resorted to another method of interpretation. Assuming that Mtilton's avowed purpose to assert Eternal Providence, And justify the ways of God to men was a misconception of the true spirit of his undertaking, they consider the epic to be chiefly symbolic and poetic. On this view, the poet himself may not be fully conscious of his own deeper meaning. Among this class are those who hold that the subject of the poem is the revolt of Lucifer; that Satan is the hero; and the central idea, the struggle of liberty against au- thority. The romantic poets of the nineteenth century, especially Byron and Shelley, accepted this interpretation; and it is congenial to the more recent idealization of the Superman. Readers of Jack London will recall in The Sea-Wolf the admiration of Wolf Larsen for those passages in which Satan is the dominating figure. A contemporary essayist holds that the 'True theme is Paradise itself '; that the profound value and interest of the epic resides in its poetic realization of the ideal of pastoral literature in the portrayal of the Eden bower.3 Another contemporary believes that Paradise Lost is an allegory dealing with the political, religious, and social 2 Pattison's Milton, p. 183. "P. E. More, Shelbourne Essays, p. 239.</page><page sequence="4">THE THEME OF PARADISE LOST 259 conditions of Milton's own time; ' that Satan is the hero, or better, the villain of the poem; that he represents the Roman Church; that the creation of Adam and Eve sym- bolizes the Protestant Christian world; that the descrip- tion of Adam and Eve in the Eden bower is " a remark- able picture of the ideal Puritan combination of C'hurch and State"; that Michael represents Cromwell and pure religion. :Finally, there is the article already mentioned of Prof. E. N. S. Thompson. He maintains that Paradise Lost is not concerned with history or theology, but is symbolic. The poet ' sees beneath the " fable " certain enduring truths regarding man's relations to the opposed forces of good and evil. . . . Milton's theme is philosophical, not historical or theological.' In brief, Professor Thompson seems to consider Par- adise Lost simply an allegory embodying an idealistic system of ethics, accepting as fact the existence of evil, and emphasizing the enduring truth of free-will, and the possibility of the ultimate triumph of good. That this is an inspiring and, from one point of view, a justifiable interpretation will be readily granted; but it does not seem to me the whole truth of the matter, nor does it approach as near to historical accuracy as may reasonably be expected. After a glance at the different theories of Paradise Lost enumerated above, one is im- pressed by the necessity of caution in accepting a theory, especially an allegorical interpretation of Milton's epic. And at the start we should keep in mind the distinction between allegory and allegorizing. Allegory is fiction consciously framed by its author as a means of express- ing abstract ideas. Allegorizing is a process of allegor- 4Rev. H. G. Rosedale, Milton Memorial Lectures, pp. 109-10.</page><page sequence="5">260 H. W. PECK ical interpretation by subsequent critics. The safest method of approach is doubtless the historical one. What did the poem mean to the author and his contemporaries? Then, in the light of their interpretation, what can it mean to us? On this method special weight should be given to the text of the epic itself; to Milton's essay on Christian Doctrine, in which he expressed abstractly con- ceptions which he represented concretely in Paradise Lost, and to the criticism of contemporaries or immediate successors, who, partaking of Milton's general attitude toward man, nature, and God, would probably share his views of the significance of the poem. After going over this ground as impartially as pos- sible I cannot avoid the conclusion that in composing Paradise Lost Milton thought he was dealing with real and historical facts. The fundamental matter of his poem is the Christianity of his time as he accepted it. Paradise Lost is simply an elaboration of The Christian Epic as outlined by Professor Santayana in Chapter vi of his Reason in R,eligion. I cannot read Milton's pro- phetically solemn statement of his purpose in Book I without feeling that he meant just what he said; that he was to sing Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste Brought death into the World, and all our woe, With loss of Eden, till one greater Man Restore us, and regain the blissful seat. Professor Thompson states that 'Milton could not write as Hebrew annalist or Christian theologian. He was free to read the Bible as a poet, not a historian, and to interpret it liberally.' Milton's own discussion of The Holy Scriptures in Ch7ristian Doctrine, Chapter</page><page sequence="6">THE THEME OF PARADISE LOST 261 xXx, gives me an exactly opposite impression. 'The writings of the prophets, apostles and evangelists, com- posed under divine inspiration, are called the Holy Scrip- tures.' 5 ' The Scriptures, therefore, partly by reason of their own simplicity, and partly through the divine illumina- tion, are plain and perspicuous in all things necessary to salvation, and adapted to the instruction even of the most unlearned, through the medium of diligent and con- stant reading.' a 'No passage of Scripture is to be in- terpreted in more than one sense.' 7 The author, how- ever, allows exceptions to this rule. 'The rule and canon of faith, therefore, is Scripture alone.' 8 'Lastly, no in- ferences from the text are to be admitted, but such as follow necessarily and plainly from the words themselves, lest we should be constrained to receive what is not written for what is written, the shadow for the substance, the fallacies of human reasoning for the doctrines of God, for it is by the declaration of Scripture, and not by the conclusions of the schools that our consciences are bound.' 9 Milton's literal interpretation of the Scrip- tures is evidenced throughout this work. He evidently accepts the Biblical account of the creation and the fall, and the miracles; 10 and he believes in the reality of angels, good and evil.11 The tendency of the ninetenth and twentieth century mind is directly away from this point of view. The story of the creation and the fall is now generally re- garded as a myth, and the doctrine of the verbal inspira- 5 C. D., p. 437. 9 C. D., p. 443. 8 0. D., p. 440. 10 0. D., pp. 169, 253. 7 C.

But there is no reason for crediting Milton with views of science of which men had at that time hardly begun to dream. As a suggestive classification of Milton's outlook, the history of myths might be divided into three stages. At first there is the era of unquestioning belief. Later, in a more sophisticated time, there arise doubts and differences of opinion, and the corresponding necessity of explana- tion and apologetics. Finally, in a scientific or philo- sophic age, the myth is either entirely discarded, or, by an allegoristic interpretation, is made the artistic me- dium for the presentation of some significant truth. Ac- cording to the present writer, Milton lived in an age of transition from the first to the second period. But the modern interpreters, ignoring the vast changes which two centuries have made in the mental life of the race, have proceeded summarily to classify Atilton with themselves. Professor Thompson, in support of his contention that Milton 'values the rebellion of Lucifer and the sin in Eden not as historical fact but as symbolical of moral truth,' cites Paradise Lost 5. 570-576. Yet for thy good This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach Of human sense I shall delineate so, By likening spiritual to corporeal forms, As may express them best-though what if Earth Be but the shadow of Heaven, and things therein Each to other like more than on Earth is thought! This species of symbolism Milton explained more defi- nitely in Christian Doctrine. 'When we speak of know- ing God, it must be understood with reference to the im- perfect comprehension of man; for to know God as He really is, far transcends thQ powers of man's thoughts,</page><page sequence="8">THE THEME OF PAERADISE LOST 263 much more of his perception. . . . Our safest way is to form in our minds such a conception of God as shall correspond with his own delineation and representation of himself in the sacred writings.' 12 In other words, the superhuman beings are represented as they are in Para- dise Lost, because that method is in accord with the di- vinely ordained symbolism of the Scriptures. The use of this svmbolism, however, does not negate belief in the reality of the rebellion of Lucifer any more than it does faith in the being of God; but it changes the locus of that reality from the material realm of human perception to the region of the spiritual and the super-sensuous. Mil- ton's description of the revolt of Lucifer is merely adapted to human comprehension; it is a material sym- bolization of historical facts in the supersensuous world. This symbolism, of course, refers not only to events and personages, but also to the moral and spiritual forces which they represent; but the point I wish to emphasize is that the events which Milton narrated through the mouth of Raphael he considered in the main actual events, although their reality was in a different sphere from that which is possible to human perception. This theory, if true, exonerates Mtilton from many of the charges of inconsistency in his narrative; such as his anthropomorphism, and the confusion of material and immaterial acts ascribed to the angels. Not only Professor Thompson's contention that MIilton considered the revolt of Lucifer valuable for its symbol- ism of abstract ideas alone, but also his treatment of Milton's devil as a mere personification of the forces of evil, is lacking in historical perspective. Impossible as the belief in a personal devil is to most people now, it ' C. D., pp. 16, 17. 9</page><page sequence="9">264 H. W. PECK was not so in the age of Milton. 'Throughout the Old and New Tesltament the devil figures as a personage free to dwell where he pleases, and to act as he will'; and he is so represented, together with the legions of other evil angels, in Chapter ix of Christian Doctrine. Students of the Middle Ages are familiar with the conception of an actual personal devil, the originator and head of the forcees of evil in the universe-the prince of the powers of the air-able to assume at will various forms. The modern tendency to attenuate his Satanic Majesty to a mere personification is the last insult. We have only to recall the Salem Witchcraft to be convinced how firm at one time was the conviction of the existence of demonic agencies. Philology as well as history verifies this view. Ephesians 6; 12, 'For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,' means simply: 'We are fighting against wicked demons of the upper air.' 13 The transition from the mythological to the modern view of the devil is illustrated in Burns' Address to the Deil. Burns was, at least while sober, completely emancipated and able to address the devil with patronizing good humor. But his 'rev'rend grannie' was thoroughly orth- odox in her belief, and Burns was, too, when he was drunk. Turning to the earlier criticism of Paradise Lost, not only did the vast body of Milton's contemporaries agree with him that the epic is elaborated upon a basis of his- toric fact, but the critics, the cultivated men of the sev- enteenth and early eighteenth centuries so interpreted it. 13 Greenough and Kittredge, Words and Their Ways in English Speech, p. 258.</page><page sequence="10">THE THEME OF PARADISE LOST 265 John Dennis wrote of Milton as a modern poet who sur- passed all the ancients and all the moderns, because, avail- ing himself of the enthusiasm derived from religion, he wrote under the inspiration of true religion, or Chris- tianity. Dr. Johnson wrote in his life of Milton: 'We all, indeed, feel the effects of Adam's disobedience; we all sin like Adam, and like him must all bewail our of- fenses; we have restless and insidious enemies in the fallen angels, and in the blessed spirits we have guardians and friends; in the redemption of mankind we hope to be included;, in the description of heaven and hell we are surely interested, as we are all to. reside hereafter either in the regions of horror or bliss.' The main reason, then, for concluding that Milton be- lieved that his epic was built upon a basis of historic fact is that it was founded upon the Scriptures, which were accepted as revealed truth by Milton and the mass of his contemporaries. But there is another well-known fact in support of this view-Milton's idea of the function of poetic inspiration. In more recent times there has been a division of human faculty; objective truth being given to the domain of science, and the subjective world of imagination and fancy being relegated to the poet. But in Milton's time this division did not exist, and the imagination was considered an organ in the acquisition of truth. Poetry was held by Sidney and the scholars who inherited the theories of classical criticism as a more philosophical and higher thing than history. Milton looked upon his art as a sublime mission. He identified the muse, Urania, with the spirit of prophetic inspira- tion. In discussing the Holy Spirit he wrote: 14 ' It is also used to signify the spiritual gifts conferred by God 14C. D., p. 153.</page><page sequence="11">266 H. W. PECK on individuals.' In other words, iMilton considered the gift of poetic inspiration as one phase of the Holy Spirit. He selected for his subject truths revealed in the Old Testament by God, and he believed himself also a chosen medium of revelation: Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine Following, above the Olympian hill I soar, Above the flight of Pegasean wing! The meaning, not the name, I call; for thou Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top Of old Olympus dwell'st; but, heavenly-born, Before the hills appeared or fountain flowed, Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse. Another consideration may help to support the view that Milton believed in the historical reality of the main characters and events of his epic. He is accused of blending incongruously the truths of Christianity with the fictions of pagan mythology. But this objection has been answered by De Quincey. 'To Milton the person- ages of the heathen Pantheon were not merely familiar fictions, or established poetical properties; they were evil spirits. That they were so was the creed of the early in- terpreters. In their demonology the Hebrew and the Greek poets had a common ground. Up to the advent of Christ the fallen angels had been permitted to delude mankind. To Milton, as to Jerome, Moloch was Mfars, and Chemosh Priapus. Plato knew of hell as Tartarus, and the battle of the giants in Hesiod is no fiction, but an obscured tradition of the war once waged in heaven.' 15 I have already noted how Milton gave the name Urania to the spirit of divine inspiration; and one quotation will, I believe, verify De Quincey's theory: IQuoted by Mark Pattison, Milton, p. 198.</page><page sequence="12">THE THEME OF PARADISE LOST 267 The hasty multitude Admiring entered; and the work some praise, And some the architect. His hand was known In Heaven by many a towered structure high, . . . Nor was his name unheard or unadored In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell From Heaven they fabled, thrown by Angry Jove Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, A summer's day, and with the setting sun Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star, On Lemnos, the AZgman isle. Thus they relate, Erring; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before.16 Milton, in the words of Mark Pattison, 'conceives a poet to be one who employs his imagination to make a revelation of truth, truth which the poet himself entirely believes.' And when he employs fictitious names and de- scribes material actions it is but as symbolism of that higher reality which transcends human perception and comprehension. It must be admitted that Milton did supplement imaginatively (in the current sense) the out- line of received fact. The allegory of Satan's meeting with Sin and Death, to which Dr. Johnson strenuously objected, is an instance. So, the incidental personifica- tion of Chaos and Night, and of Rumour, Chance, Tu- mult, Confusion and Discord is a survival of the con- ventions of mediaeval fiction. But that allegorical elab- oration may co-exist with a firm conviction of the truth of the subject matter of a work of art may be seen in the case of The Pilgrim's Progress. So much for historical criticism; now, what is to be the attitude of the future toward the greatest epic of the "I P. L., i, 732-748. Cf. also P. L. I, 364-375.</page><page sequence="13">268 H. W. PECK English language? The thought of Paradise Lost, at least for many, ' can never again be accepted as a liter- ally veracious account of the creation and the fall.' For this reason the poem can probably never again hold quite the place, especially in the popular mind, that it once had. But there is left, for scholars at least, the path of historical receptiveness, and the appreciation of Para- dise Lost at its maximum will be the reward of the scholar. If we cannot accept Milton's theology, we should be willing, in the words of Professor Trent, 'to realize it imaginatively.' While Milton thought he was writing about a real universe, we can accept it sympa- thetically as a conventional, imaginary one; just as we accept the supernatural in Hamnlet, and the fairy world of A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest. It would be unfair, however, in re-emphasizing the earlier interpretation of Paradise Lost, to underestimate the contributions of recent criticism. Beyond what seemed to Milton the reality, material or immaterial, of his characters, there loomed the moral and spiritual meaning which they embodied. By restricting himself to this phase of criticism Professor Thompson has made an important contribution to our understanding of Para- dise Lost. My objection to his view is solely to his as- sumption that this interpretation practically covers the field, and that it embraces Milton's own complete view of his epic. As a dramatic poem excels an allegory, be- cause in addition to its abstract or moral significance, it contains the attraction of concrete personalities and the complexity of real events, so to our willing aesthetic imagination the interest in the events and personages of Paradise Lost may be added to the value of its ideal sig- nificance. 'But though the machinery of spiritual in-</page><page sequence="14">TIE THEME OF PARADISE LOST 269 terpretation is thrown aside, the essence of it survives as a permanent gain. The value of human souls and the significance of their destiny are no longer operative as abstract principles to be clothed in allegorical fantasy, but as an added force and tenderness in the penetrative imagination.' 17 In conclusion, trying to give the broadest possible in- terpretation of Paradise Lost, I would define it as an artificial epic, embodying structurally a theistic and Bib- lical view of the universe; but including also a superb portrayal of a type of individualism; supreme in its poetic realization of the ideal of pastoral literature; and exemplifying an idealistic system of ethics, which em- phasizes the doctrine of free will. In addition to this, it is written with the greatest loftiness and sublimity of style, the reflex of a mind of unsurpassable grandeur. That the poem has, like Hamlet, such a breadth of sug- gestiveness, and elements that are of interest to such a variety of types of mind, is an evidence of its enduring greatness. HII. W.
