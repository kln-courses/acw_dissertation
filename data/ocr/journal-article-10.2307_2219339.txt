CLARK One of David Hume's arguments against the belief that moral distinctions are matters of fact is that "incest in the human species is criminal.... [but] the very same action, and the same relations in animals have not the smallest moral turpitude and deformity".' If "the guilt or moral deformity of [an] action" could be proved by "demonstrative reasoning" from the mere rela- tions of the objects under consideration (relations, that is, of "resemblance, contrariety, degrees in quality, and proportions in quantity and number"), we should have to admit that a dog's copulation with his daughter was as much an evil as a human father's betrayal of his child's complaisance. To the imagined reply that a man may know that he is committing an evil, while dogs do not, Hume replies that the evil of incest cannot rest in our knowledge that it is evil (how could we then know that it was?). His point is not that we excuse dogs for copulating with their daughters on the grounds that they don't know what they are doing, but that there is nothing to blame them for. The evil of incest, accordingly, does not rest merely in the physical relations between the partners. It rests instead, so Hume goes on to claim in an outrageous non sequitur, merely in the speaker's attitude. Hume's argument is open to rebuttal. Most commentators are so embar- rassed that such a great philosopher should have thought so bad an argu- ment "entirely decisive" that they pass over it in silence. Is it really obvious that dogs and humans perform the "very same act" when they copulate, given that they do so for different reasons, with different social conse- quences, with different attitudes to their partners and prospective offspring? *An earlier version was read to the Philosophy Society of Stirling University. I am grateful to that body, and also to my colleagues in Glasgow. Some of the material in section II forms the basis for "Good dogs and other animals" in P. Singer (ed.)

CLARK If "animal incest" and "human incest" are acts of the same kind, then they are equally evil, or equally indifferent. To disapprove of the act when done by humans but not when done by dogs would be as silly as approving of assault when performed by whites but not when performed by blacks. Hume points to the inconsistency involved in believing (i) that canine inbreeding is the same act as human incest, (ii) that canine inbreeding is not intrinsically evil, and (iii) that human incest is intrinsically evil. But it is not necessary to abandon the third of these beliefs, nor would it follow from such abandon- ment that nothing was intrinsically evil. Only one of the triad need be rejected, and the objectivity of morals can be preserved whichever choice is made. The third belief has been rejected most consistently by the Cynics. Diogenes concluded that whatever animals did without sin, he too could do. Herodotus had noted that most nations had reckoned that humans might follow the animal example and copulate even in the gods' temples, or enter them after intercourse without washing first. Egyptians and Greeks, he held, were better advised.2 Diogenes revived the argument. The "natural life" led by animals could also be led by human animals, if they put aside their pride and unreasonable shame. "When Oedipus had children by his mother, he should have concealed this or made it legal in Thebes. Domestic fowls do not object to such relationships, nor dogs, nor any ass".3 Incest (father- beating, cannibalism) is not an evil "by nature", but only "by convention". Diogenes' conversion to the simple life came, according to Theophrastus, through watching a mouse "running about, nor looking for a place to lie down, not fearing the dark, not seeking any of the things that are reckoned dainties".4 What other animals did, human animals could do, by realizing what they needed and how easy it was to get it if they were tough enough. Diogenes' animals, like those of most moralists, do what they like, and do not worry about their reputations, nor complain when the universe is not to their moral taste. "Animals have little or no sense of virtue or vice; they quickly lose sight of the relations of blood; and are incapable of that of right and property."5 What Hume forgets is that this is precisely what has been recommended by those of Cynic descent. The good life has been understood as the life that animals lead, in obedience to their natural impulses. "The soul of beasts has a greater natural capacity and perfection for the generation 2 Herodotus, Histories 2.64. 3Dio Chrysostom 10.29; Chrysippus, Diogenes Laertius 7.188. 4Diogenes Laertius 6.22. 5Treatise 2.1.12: pp. 324 ff.</page><page sequence="3">HUME, ANIMALS AND THE OBJECTIVITY OF MORALS 119 of virtue; for without command or instruction, unsown and unploughed as it were, it naturally brings forth and develops such virtue as is proper in each case". It is their nature to flee subjection, and females are in no way inferior to males in spirit and valour. "Beasts' life, for the most part, is controlled by the essential desires and pleasures. As for those that are non-essential, but merely natural, [they] resort to them without either irregularity or excess, [and] celebrate at the proper time a love without deceit or hire, [whereas] not even Nature with Law for her ally can keep within bounds the unchastened vice of [human] hearts."6 Animals, in short, have been held to be creatures that act in accordance with right reason, out of their undistorted affections. What is done "naturally" has been held to be a pattern also for human behaviour. On this account Hume's argument must fail: if incest is no evil amongst animals it is no evil "by nature". It does not follow that there are no natural evils or natural goods. The social aspects of animal life will concern me later in this paper. What is of interest here is that those who have followed in Diogenes' steps have shared with other moralists the notion that animals are essentially unsocial. When Aristotle asserted that an unsocial human being was either a beast or a god,7 he did not intend to imply that all animals were unsocial, for he distinguishes "beasts" precisely as unsocial, flesh-eating and aggressive animals, and acknowledges that some animals treat their offspring in "more politic" a manner.8 But though Aristotle understood that for many animal- kinds living-together was more than "pasturing in the same field",9 as it was for cattle, there has been a tendency to assume that animals were individual- ists in a way that properly brought-up people were not. Animals weren't flag-flappers, nor inclined to sell their self-reliance for security. Their children, once grown, were independent - so that father-beating, the con- ventional Greek's nightmare, was no special evil. Their virtue, natural virtue, lay in the value they placed upon their individual lives, the courage and temperance and prudence with which they made their own ways in the world. Human beings were unusual in that they needed friends if they were to live a worthwhile life.'? Diogenes' mouse was happy in his solitude. This vision is not without its value. Those moral philosophers who have characterised morality as a set of conventions founded upon social conven- ience could usefully be reminded that past philosophers have praised virtue as a necessary element of the worthwhile, self-sufficient life. The value that a 6Plutarch, Gryllus 987 ff., Moralia, tr. H. Cherniss &amp; W. C.

"Altruism", when that is construed as a readiness always to give way to others and prefer their plans to what would have been one's own, is an abdication of responsibility, a denial that one is oneself worth anything - and by implication a denial that any one individual is worth anything: only the collective counts. For the ethical egoist "a person who has no respect for himself, who lacks courage, who neglects his life and values, who degrades himself or wastes himself on trivia may be morally condemned, although he has hurt or endangered no-one but himself"." The virtue of an animal lies in her disposition and capacity to live her life. According to the tradition which I am now considering animals do, in general, maintain their ways. What they do is commendable. If they do not follow all the conventional rules of human society that is a reason for considering those rules to be merely conventional. Natural law is defined as quod natura omnia animalia docuit - what Nature has taught all animals.12 If there is no sign that animals have all been taught a supposed law - as it might be, a law against incest - then incest, for example, is not a natural evil, not something that all creatures should avoid for their own lives' sake. II But let me turn now to the next possible solution of Hume's puzzle, namely to abandon the second member of the inconsistent triad. Perhaps animal inbreeding is indeed an evil, and those that can justly prevent its occurrence ought to do so. Animals, perhaps, cannot prevent its happening (for they lack the knowledge and the power), but those who have charge of them maybe ought to exercise care on their behalf. Hume's argument can be phrased as follows: if we do not acknowledge any duty, however weak, to prevent animal inbreeding, even amongst animals in our charge, how can we claim that incest as such is an evil? The argument is paralleled by one familiar to vegetarians: if we have no duty to prevent predators killing their prey, how can we pretend that the killing of animals is an evil in which we should not ourselves indulge? We cannot claim that it is an evil only if the agents know it is an evil. Either it is an evil independently of their knowledge, or it is itself no evil at all. The question of animal-killing I have considered elsewhere,13 and con- cluded that we have no general obligation to avert all evils. That we ought not to do evil is one thing; that we ought to prevent all evils, at whatever cost to the independence of our proteges, the stability of the ecosystem and the " T.

Predation may be an evil, even if it is one that we cannot hope to eliminate. We are familiar with the occasional moral duty to tolerate the existence of evils we ought not to encourage or engage in. Correspondingly, even a moralist who did conclude that animal inbreeding was an evil would not be honour-bound to engage in any ridiculous attempt to proscribe it, but it might be true that those animals clearly in our charge (domestic and farm animals) ought to be barred from incestuous relationships. What would identify incest as an evil? "Supposing that there is no presage of conscience whatever against such matches, yet the fact that progeny produced from such unions soon dwindle away and degenerate is as much a declaration of [God's] will against them as a presage of conscience before- hand would be".'4 Leonard Williams has commented on the terrible pattern of deformities in the dog-world.... The small terrier is suffering from dislocation of the eye. The face and eyes of the St. Bernard are dropping so low that often its eyelashes are turned inwards. A number of dachshunds are becoming paralysed as a result of spinal trouble, and toy poodles are prone to a slipping kneecap. All this is due to unscrupulous inbreeding."5 The blame for this lies on the breeders, not the unfortunate dogs, but such results do suggest that inbreeding is indeed an evil. Recent evolutionary theory perhaps suggests that the original drawback of inbreeding may not be the production of deformity but the loss of genetic variation,'6 but once the pattern of outbreeding is established it would be dangerous not to continue with it. What of Morris's second criterion for right action, the voice of conscience or immediate revulsion? That "we" feel no such revulsion when considering the affairs of pedigree dogs is Hume's starting point. But our emotions are often not engaged by the doings of those whom we consider alien, or outside our present community: what are the sufferings of Egyptian slaves to us, or corrupt practices in Bangladesh, unless we force ourselves to recall what our attitude would be, were we the slaves or the oppressed? The sense of revulsion that constitutes one piece of evidence against a practice is what "we" feel when "we" are the ones involved or have managed to identify ourselves with those involved. So what "we" feel about animal inbreeding should be what animals feel, so can be expected to feel: what "we", the 14 J. B. Morris, Towards the Conversion of the Hindus (London, 1843), p. 185. 15 L.

CLARK community of mammals as it exists for our sympathetic imagination, expect- ably feel. In Hume's day it was taken for granted that animals would let nothing stand in the way of their desires. Their wants were simple - like the dog with one thought for each paw (Food, Food, Sex and Food) - and it was supposed that they could acknowledge no distinctions amongst the objects of greed and lust. This was not to say that animals do not have preferences, but that they do not seem to have taboos. What endeared them to one class of moralist was anathema to another. To live "like an animal" was (and still is, in the mouths of judges) to live without any acknowledged restraints of decency, good manners or respect for persons. Some of those who disapproved of animal behaviour would also frown at alien human customs. Samuel Johnson could not believe that "savages", illiterate peoples, could have anything to teach him. "Pity is not natural to man ... but acquired and improved by the cultivation of reason. Savages are always cruel." "Natural affection is nothing: but affection from principle and established duty is sometimes wonderfully strong" [- so savages have no more affec- tion than do hens. Nor do they marry:] "a savage man and a savage woman meet by chance; and when the man sees another woman that pleases him better, he will leave the first."" Johnson's determined ignorance is now an embarrassment to his admirers (including myself). Why could he not have understood that other human tribes have their own arts and decencies? He spoke from within his tradition, as Aristotle did when he declared that the further barbarians were beast-like, in that they lived "only by perception", without - he supposed - being able to give principled reasons for their actions, or even strictly to "act" (to choose as the right thing to do) at all.18 Moralists are now conscious that all human tribes have inherited cosmolo- gies and political systems. We hope, at least, that there are no "natural slaves", unable to internalize the law and acting out of immediate desire or fear.19 ButJohnson's attitude to animals, that they too are moved only by the prospect of immediate gratification, is still widely held. "Anthropomorph- ism" is the deadly sin of supposing that animals have customs, friends, serious emotions or needs beyond "the merely physical". Most commenta- tors now recognise that contempt for "savages" serves ideological and com- mercial interests, providing an excuse for disrupting the "savages"' life, 17 J.

That contempt for "animals" serves similarly ideological ends is not so widely recognised. To behave "like an animal" is to have dropped out, to have abandoned cultivated manners and an awareness of one's place in the social universe. To be an animal is to be mere material for the purposes of human beings, whether those purposes are humane or not. This dogmatic rejection of what is supposed to be anthropomorphism is itself a reaction against the moralistic projection on to animals of our own cultural forms. Students of animal behaviour have preferred to suppose that animals are moved by much more local considerations, not by any sense of their place in any social universe. If their behaviour looks rational this is a produce of "the invisible hand". The preference for relatively local, "simple" explanations has been fruitful, even if no adequate account of what consti- tutes a "simple" explanation has yet been given. If woodlice congregate in damp patches we need not suppose that they have some idea of what they are looking for, or an internal map of the neighbouring territory. It is enough that they move faster when it's dry, and slow down when it's damp. If salmon can find their way back to their natal stream, it may be that they are merely swimming up the olfactory gradient, swimming in the direction of the stronger scent. If hunting wasps construct nests and supply their future progeny with paralysed caterpillars, they can do so without any thought of those progeny, merely by following out the "fixed action patterns" of their kind. They thereby give the impression of following a long-term plan - an impression that can readily be removed by interfering with the process - without any need to have that long-term result in mind or adapt their behaviour to achieve it. The higher vertebrates and molluscs are not so readily interpreted as merely responding to immediate stimuli in accordance with fixed action patterns. But even if much of their lives is spent in acting out such relatively fixed patterns, we can reasonably enquire what the patterns are likely to be - and find that they are not so simple-minded as the traditional picture suggests. Animals that did not discriminate between sexual partners, that behaved like Johnson's "savages", would often copulate with close relatives. Their offspring would be born at hazard and be cared for, if at all, solely by the mother. Even the admission of mother-love, incidentally, as an innate mechanism triggered by the sucking reflex or a gaping mouth so as to tie the mother's satisfactions to the satisfaction of her offspring, carries us beyond the simple model of animal egoism. There is good evolutionary reason either to produce so many offspring that a few survive no matter what, or else to produce a few offspring that are then well cared for. This evolutionary function will not usually be the goal even of human endeavour. What can be</page><page sequence="8">124 STEPHEN R. L. CLARK expected is that animals will generally have goals that serve this function. They will prefer sexual partners like, but not too like or too familiar with themselves; and they will (if they are higher vertebrates) care for their offspring. Since such care will require that they be able to provide for them, they will not, in general, do what produces offspring unless they have provision to support them. This is why many land-birds form couples only when there is territorial space available, and may (in some species) be attached precisely to the space rather than to their individual partner. In those species the appearance of marital fidelity is an illusion: what generally keeps the two birds together is that each has an attachment to the territorial space. Those who are unable to make good their claim upon such a territory do not form couples, nor produce many offspring (except of course by "cheating" - laying eggs in an established couple's nest, or seducing the female). In other species the problem is dealt with by enabling them to recognize each other as individuals, and binding them to marital fidelity. Barbary doves, for example, have been shown to be monogamous, to be faithful to their first partners even at unfamiliar nesting sites.20 These patterns of preference can thus be shown to make sense in terms of the needs of the offspring, and the nature of the animal's Umwelt (which is to say, the environment as it is for an animal of that kind, with those senses, capacities and preferences). We can be sure the characteristics of the animal kind in question will not be random assortments. Creatures that characteris- tically produce a few, slowly maturing offspring will not be indifferent to their offspring, nor mate promiscuously, nor be unable to distinguish indi- viduals of their own kind. Further predictions are possible. Members of the same species are natural rivals, for food and territory and mates. But it does not follow that arrogant individualists will be most successful in propagating their kind. Nature encountered her Hobbesian crisis long ago, and found ways of making peace prevail. Less mythologically: creatures that always fight to the finish, that will never accept defeat gracefully, that always kill or rob their rivals, may win an occasional battle, but must devote so much time to forcing their way on others that any submissive mutant will be able to leave more progeny. Therefore, goods will not usually be fought for directly; instead, creatures are likely to evolve "contest-competition", so that they try out their strengths in a way that does not seriously damage anyone. Losers then accept their slot, and may even (in disaster areas) allow themselves to perish while the dominant few eat well. This last phenomenon need not be interpreted as conscious suicide for the good of the tribe. It is more likely to be a byproduct of the strategy of "wait and see": better to wait for the dominant's leavings 20 Carl Ericson, "Mate Selection", in Oxford Companion toAnimal Studies ed. D. MacFarlane (Oxford, 1981), p. 387.</page><page sequence="9">HUME, ANIMALS AND THE OBJECTIVITY OF MORALS 125 and hope for a return match later on than risk a real fight now. Conversely, it is usually better for the dominants to allow their subordinates lives of their own, sometimes even to assist them, and not to press home their attacks lest their victim turn upon them with "the courage of despair" and cost them more than they care to pay." The rules of "war" were among the first to be noticed by ethologists: witness the "merciful wolf', who spares his defeated rival when that rival rolls over and pretends to be a cub again. Lorenz's assumption22 that the wolf is "inhibited" from killing his rival (where a human victor would not be) is questionable on at least two counts. Firstly, there is good reason to think that human beings too are well able to kill each other, but usually do not: their record does not seem much worse than the wolves'. Secondly, Lorenz gives no reason to describe the case as one of "inhibition". The wolf does not (generally) kill - but that is evidence that he does not (generally) wish to; perhaps he wishes only to establish his superior rank. The wolf need not be understood as a soul divided in the Platonic manner between Desire and Spirit. Similar apparent inhibitions obtain in the sexual area. Female chimpanzees resist the advances of their brothers, or of any too familiar males. When Lucy Temerlin, a chimpanzee reared with humans and without experience of her conspecifics, reached puberty she resisted the attentions of her human foster-brother and foster-father while avidly pursuing any other human males.23 Here the reports do suggest more strongly that Lucy experienced considerable conflict between her desire and her aversion, a conflict that might, contentiously, be compared to those of moralizing humanity. For there to be a real analogy, such conflicts must be considered as something more than the merely contingent opposition of one appetite to another. When animals find themselves pulled in two directions at once, their behaviour is either a blend of the two opposed patterns, more or less ritualized, or else some apparently irrelevant "displacement activity". Court- ship ceremonies have plausibly been interpreted as a way of resolving the tension between desire and fear. A moral conscience may be similarly displayed, but there are two features of it that are not so readily identifiable. The first is that the agent is averse not merely to the object that she desires, but to her own desire of it. She is displeased with herself for being weak. For moral conscience to be operative, the agent must not merely feel but reflect on, or contemplate, her own emotion. The second (and connected) feature is that moral conscience reflects upon the actions and emotions of others as well as on one's own. To disapprove of oneself is also to disapprove of others similarly placed. 21 N. Tinbergen, "On War and Peace in Animals and Men", Science 160 (1968), pp. 1411 ff. 22 K. Lorenz, On Aggression, tr. M.

CLARK Indeed, the capacity to contemplate (and disapprove of) one's own emotions and intentions may fairly be regarded as secondary. I come to know of myself by knowing others who know me; I come to disapprove of myself by knowing of (and approving) others who might. So it is crucial to the existence of conscience (and self-consciousness in general) that there be social groups whose members attempt to regulate each other's behaviour. To do this they must be able to reidentify each other, to have some grasp of past history, to attend not merely to the relations between themselves and others but also to the relations between the others. Such behaviour is not always found where we might expect it. The cannibalistic pair of chimpanzees discovered in the Gombe, for example, were (understandably) feared and resented by their fellows, but there was apparently no attempt to ostracise or punish them.24 Other breaches of tribal discipline perhaps earn greater disapproval, notably (in some species) the attempt to dispossess an established nesting couple, or a failure of parental duty. If vervet females can respond to their own cub's cry, and also look (pointedly) at the mother of another crying cub,25 there is reason to think that they are operating such a social system, so that the roots of conscience are there. Accordingly, there seems good reason to question the second member of Hume's inconsistent triad. Incest (for example) perhaps is an evil, even amongst animals, and shown to be so both by the generally obnoxious consequences of inbreeding, and by the fact that most females at least are somewhat averse to it (though whether they are averse to it in others, or actually disapprove of their own slight impulses towards it is another matter). To live like the animals may not be so revolting nor so revolutionary a policy as moralizing judges and romantic drop-outs have supposed. III What of the first member of the triad? Is it really true that canine inbreeding is the same act as human incest merely because the external relations involved are the same? If we understand that "the same act" has been committed when an old lady is pushed over (a) by a domestic dog (savagely), (b) by a hurrying child (carelessly), (c) by a mugger (brutally), (d) by a policeman (to get her out of the way), (e) by an avalanche (indiffe- rently), then in that sense male dog and human father may perform the same act when they tup their daughters. But why should we accept such an external definition of action? Hume's other example betrays the confusion: a sapling whose growth strangles the parent tree, he claims, displays the same 24 J. D. Bygoff, "Cannibalism among Wild Chimpanzees", Nature 238 (1972), pp. 410 ff; see H. Kummer, "Aspects of Morality among Non-Human Primates", in G. S.

But it is obvious that the sapling (unless we are to suppose that it is a dryad), is not committing an act of ingratitude. The same moral act is not done merely when the immediate consequences are the same. Even a gander does not commit the same act, except in an etiolated sense, when he mates with the goose with whom he has conducted the triumph ceremony and when he mates, without ceremony, with another female.26 It is not the same act, because it occupies a different role in the gander's life (and the goose's) - it does not lead on to marital or parental care. When we turn to the animal whose inner life we best appreciate, the human animal, it is clear that similar physical movements may have radically different meanings for the agents, and for any careful observer. Accordingly, it should not so readily be assumed that the same act is done when canine and human males have sex with their daughters, sisters or mothers. Motive and meaning and social consequences may differ. Because morality is concerned with motives and meanings, we cannot equate "incest" merely with "inbreeding". For a human being to commit incest of the commonest kind (a father's or step-father's seduction of his daughter) is to use another creature for his momentary pleasure, to rob a child of her childhood and to betray a spouse. Incest as it is defined in some societies resides precisely in a breach of those rules that define the roles and duties of social beings, and these may have very little to do with "inbreeding" just as such. A man may commit incest in seducing his deceased wife's sister: dogs can do no such thing, even if they mate with sisters. The evil of incest, in other words, may well lie in the motive, the lack of concern for existing obligations, and the breach of custom, not in the physical movements and their physical antecedents and consequences. Dogs, accordingly, do not commit incest, and it is pointless to suggest that we might disapprove of their committing incest. Nor is it true that "the facts are analogous to human prostitution"27 (except in the most superficial and uninteresting sense) if male humming birds allow access to selected flowers only to females who will mate with them. Similarly, when Jane van Lawick- Goodall sees a hyena killing a newly-born wildebeest, she feels sympathy and regret, but does not suppose that the hyena's act is an evil one.28 The spider who eats her mate, and the mate who avoids being eaten by proffering a carefully wrapped fly, are doing no evil, though human couples who behaved like that would hardly escape comment. 26 Lorenz, op. cit. p. 174: Of the gander who mates with a goose without the triumph ceremony: "he does not love her in the least". See also K. Lorenz, The Foundations of Ethology (New York/Vienna, 1981), pp. 89 ff on "functionally determined concepts". 27 D. F.

CLARK On this account moral evil, and moral goodness, do not reside in the physical relations of the agents, but in their motives, their broken or unbroken obligations, the meaning attached to their acts in the social com- munity of which they are parts. This is not to draw Hume's conclusion, that "moral turpitude" lies only in the eye of the beholder: it is to accept that it lies in the motives and meanings (the subjective relationships) of the agents. If an incestuous father did not mean to break the law, and did not exalt his own momentary desire over the well-being of others, and did not isolate himself and his daughter from society, and did not take advantage of filial affection or infantile weakness, then perhaps his act was not wickedly inces- tuous. Correspondingly, so Hillel Steiner claims, "we would not say that an elephant had acted rightly in kicking aside a heavy fallen tree which was blocking the progress of an ambulance on a jungle road".29 She may do what she does out of immediate impulses of kindliness, or out of professional habit, but not out of any serious grasp of what she ought to do. Accordingly, her action is not strictly right action, for it is not fully and properly a moral act at all: it is not undertaken with a view to the right, any more than the hyena's. This is not to say that animals can do no good deeds, and no bad ones. They do not commit incest strictly so called, any more than they evade taxes, but some of their motives are commendable and some are not. Van Lawick- Goodall does not condemn the hyena: she feels very differently when confronted by chimpanzees who spurn and bully one of their own company who is partly paralysed.30 Their behaviour evinces callousness and cruelty because they do know what they are doing. One chimpanzee, indeed, did overcome his own distaste enough to assist his sick companion. Even this is perhaps not true moral action, not a determination to do the right thing, but simply a kindliness. Nonetheless, that chimpanzee's heart was in the right place, and his acts (broadly so called) were commendable. But what if there were rational creatures, capable of intending to do the right thing, who had natural motives of another kind than ours? Gilbert Harman proposes that alien intelligences who had no compunction about treating us as we treat other animals would be "dreadful enemies to be repelled and even destroyed", but that we should not judge that "they should not act as they do".31 That humankind ought not to be destroyed by "supermantises", intelligent beings that reproduce like hunting wasps, would mean only that it would be (for us) a very terrible thing, a thing worth fearing; but no trace of "moral turpitude and deformity" would attach to the acts or the events that brought it about (any more than to solar flares, or the 29 H.

That the genuine actions of the supermantises are not morally evil, while similarly constituted acts of ours would be, rests on the very Humean ground that they lack certain fundamental sentiments: the acts are not the same, because they embody quite different meanings. The hyena is not being cruel, is not delighting in her sadistic control of her victim, and could not be expected to be moved by quasi-parental affection when the young wildebeest seeks parental care. She displays no moral turpitude, because her motives are to feed herself and her young, and she does not deliberately blind herself to the pain of her victims. Supermantises, unlike hyenas, are creatures with a vision of the world to which they can strive to accommodate their unruly emotions. Some of what they do must be accounted action in the strict sense: they do it as being the best thing they can imagine to do. Some of what they do may even issue from motives with which we could sympathise, were we not so deeply involved. Only a few supermantises, let us suppose, are so depraved as to like to see people squirm: most of them consider us only as nesting material. This is not to say, as we should say for creatures of mammalian extraction, that they think of us as food for their young. Not being mammals, the supermantises have no need of parental affection: they enjoy laying eggs in suitable mate- rial, and have no special ties with the eventual product. For much of their history, indeed, they hardly noticed that there was a connection between ovipositing and the emergence of new supermantises. Nor do they feel the sort of concern for their prey that hunters and farmers must develop, lest they cull the creatures to extinction. The supermantises, let us suppose, are native to a planet so large that they have always been able to find new prey. The net result is that they enjoy messing up the world, and have never found any need to restrain themselves from that pleasure. Not being equipped to sympathise with the young or weak, there is nothing that they could mean by sparing us. The moral of this story is that our community of moral agents is no larger than the mammalian order or, perhaps, the higher vertebrates. Only beings with experience of parental and filial affection can get outside themselves enough to take account of what other creatures value. Even they do so fleet- ingly, until they learn to take a more rational view. To understand an action as a moral evil it is necessary to see that it arises from depraved motives, a distortion of the meanings embodied in the social universe. For mammals in general, and human beings in particular, callousness and cruelty, disloyalty and selfishness are depraved. For the supermantises it is sentimental kindli- ness that works against the emotions and purposes that they must have if there are going to be supermantises at all. On this account neither human beings nor supermantises can ask "And who is right?". Hume's argument can now be restated. Insofar as human beings and</page><page sequence="14">130 STEPHEN R. L. CLARK supermantises are not doing the same thing, there is no contradiction in saying that human acts of murder are evil while supermantis acts of oviposit- ing are not - though they have identical results. In this sense, there seems no escape from species relativism. Moral evil is nothing but the projection of our deepest sentiments upon the acts we judge, and nothing is "really" evil, any more than anything is "really" green or "really" tasty. Acts are evil, leaves are green, and caterpillars are tasty only relative to a given kind's perceptions, and nothing more can be said. If human and supermantis are to be judged by the same standards, those standards cannot rest upon species- relative sentiments. If human and supermantis are not subject to the same standards, because they never mean the same by what they do, morality is indeed subjective. There are at least four responses to this argument: we may deny the possibility of supermantises; we may insist that rationality itself constitutes a common framework for moral discourse; we may argue that supermantises are not to be condemned because what they do is allowed by ordinary moral judgement; or we may agree that they are to be condemned, by reference to a higher good than species-survival. First, are supermantises really possible? Conscience and self- consciousness take their beginnings from social life. If supermantises are so blind to the wills and needs of others, so little inclined to natural affection even for their own kind, it may seem doubtful that they could have evolved to a capacity for assessing their own actions in accordance with a vision of the world and their place in it. Creatures capable of reasoned choice must perhaps share with us, and with other mammals, the sentiments on which our ethical commitments are founded. If supermantises had the character I have described, they could not also be rational beings. Like hyenas and hunting wasps they do not strictly act at all, and it remains possible that (for example) deliberately hurting others is objectively evil, although superman- tises do no evil when they hurt others. Lacking ethical sentiment, they lack reason too. This response is not entirely convincing. Even wild dogs display the most touching loyalty and affection toward their pack-mates (though this is not quite the loyalty we feel toward our kin), but regard all other animals as meat. Even lions, who are as mammalian as we, feel no compunctions about killing and eating lion cubs. The sentiments we share even with other mammals do not guarantee that, were they to become rational, they would share our moral views. Conversely, the only non-human animals that have a well-attested "language" are bees: it does not seem impossible that there should be rational superbees, and their moral sentiments, while more agreeable than the supermantises', would probably not be ours. That there is some connec- tion between social forms, sentiments and rationality is intuitively plausible,</page><page sequence="15">HUME, ANIMALS AND THE OBJECTIVITY OF MORALS 131 but in the absence of non-imaginary examples we cannot be sure what that connection is. The second response is as follows: granted that we cannot be sure what sentiments a rational species would have to work with, we can at least insist that rationality itself is constituted by obedience to certain moral codes: to seek the truth, for example, and not to contradict oneself. If the superman- tises can talk and organise their lives by joint discussion, there are at least some creatures (namely adult supermantises) whom each of them regards as something more than mere material. If they can talk to us as well, they must come to realise that we may also be contributors to the ongoing project of rational discourse, and are not to be treated merely as means to supermantis pleasure. All rational beings must, on pain of contradiction, treat all other rational beings as fellow members of the kingdom of ends. These familiar Kantian arguments have some strength. But they do not constitute the whole of our morality. If the supermantises only parasitized terrestrial baboons we would still think that they were doing something evil. Even Kant had great difficulty in consistently excluding non-rational animals from the realm of moral objects. If we ought not to torment baboons so horribly, neither should supermantises (though their lack of immediate sentimental attachment may at first excuse them). The third available res- ponse is to say that neither we nor supermantises would be doing wrong, insofar as the primary moral duty of any creature is to preserve its kind. This second form of species-relativism does not deny that there are objective moral truths, but insists that the relevant truth is that we do right when we do what is best for our own kind. Supermantises are morally obliged to lay their eggs where they may: we are morally obliged to resist them. Such species-relativism is objectivist in intention. Its oddity, like that of naive egoism, is that "we" (the totality of moral agents) are morally obliged to struggle against each other. This need not be a contradiction, but its only plausibility rests upon a notion of the intrinsic value of the world maintained by such a struggle - which leads on to the fourth response. The superman- tises, by hypothesis, intend the destruction of all things that they can; their self-perception is of creatures dedicated to the ruin of the world. Insofar as we, as moral agents not merely as terrified victims, are opposed to them, it must be that we acknowledge the intrinsic value of the living world. Acting for the sake of the right is to act to preserve the living world itself, as a struggling community of many tribes and kinds. The supermantises may justly be condemned insofar as they are a general menace to the living world - as may we. If we are to think that there is a moral system within which supermantises may be condemned, the likeliest truths of that system are that the living world be preserved, that moral agents should conceive themselves "as</page><page sequence="16">132 STEPHEN R. L. CLARK members of a great City whose author and founder is God""3 (i.e. Creative Value), and so move beyond natural affection and fear of natural conse- quences for themselves and their closer kindred. Throughout the whole system of the visible and natural world do you not perceive a mutual connection and correspondence of parts? And is it not from hence that you frame an idea of the perfection and order and beauty of nature? And have not the Stoics heretofore said this pattern of order was worthy the imitation of rational agents? Ought we not therefore to infer the same union, order and regularity in the moral world that we perceive in the natural? Should it not therefore seem to follow that man ought not to consider himself as an independent creature, whose happiness is not con- nected with that of other(s); but rather as the part of a whole, to the common good of which he ought to conspire and order his ways and actions suitably, if he would live according to nature.33 Berkeley, for reasons that are not wholly clear, did not draw the full conclusion, but only that rational creatures were made for each other. The stronger conclusion, that all kinds and examples of creatures are parts of the greater whole and that all rational beings should appreciate that whole, seems as firmly established as the weaker principle, that restricts the moral domain to those creatures that can talk and reason. Even if we hold that moral acts are to be identified by their motives and meanings (so that what a dog does in copulating with his daughter is not what a human being does) we need not fall into species-relativism, the belief that the doings of a supermantis lie beyond our moral judgement. Insofar as such creatures constitute a deliberate danger to the whole web of life their mode of life is evil - as is ours. IV Hume argued that moral distinctions were not matters of fact, on the ground that, if they were, the doings of animals would be as condemnable or commendable as ours. I have argued, on the contrary, that we may hold any of the following positions. Even if we say that neither humans nor dogs do wrong in committing incest, it does not follow that there are no natural goods or natural evils. If we accept the tradition that follows the way of Nature, we will say that that creature is commendable who is toughest and most self-reliant, who values 32 G. Berkeley,Alciphron 3, in Works, ed. A.

Secondly, we may infer from the bad effects of inbreeding and the general disinclination at least of females to have sex with their close relatives, that incest (or inbreeding) is indeed a natural evil. On this account, that creature is commendable whose habits and emotions are of the kind that creatures of that kind must generally have if the kind is to survive. The normal affections of an animal kind constitute the framework within which moral discussion must usually take place. A good mammal is one that cares for her young, gives deference where it is due, responds appropriately to her companions' signals of play, love, pride. Finally, we may deny that non-rational animals ever strictly do what a rational animal does. Dogs do not act: they may be good dogs, but they are not (as it were) good-and-beautiful dogs,34 creatures that act for the sake of doing what is right. Supermantises do act, but their vision of what it is right to do is hideously mistaken. They have failed, so the fantasy declares, to think past their own limitations and see that the world is more than their material. Accident has released them from the normal checks and balances that ensure that no creature, no creaturely kind can quite devour the world. We recognise them as something more than dreadful enemies: they are our own distorted images. They behave as we do, and show their wickedness in disregarding the values that other creatures put upon their worlds. The objectivity of morals can thus survive Hume's attack. But the actual nature of moral objectivity is another story. University of Liverpool 34 Aristotle, Eudemian Ethics 8.1248b17 ff.</page></plain_text>
