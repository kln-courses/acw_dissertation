Mojares While her appearances are miraculous, her disappearances are what make her human. ~ Michael Taussig I The introduction of Christianity in Cebu ? and elsewhere in the Philippines ? is marked by stories of religious images lost and found (Redondo 1886: 21, [Congregantes Marianos...] 1904: 12-13, Anonymous 1932a, Anonymous 1935e, Tenazas 1965: 25-26, Joaquin 1988: 61-69 and Aviado 1975: 168). We recall the Santo Nino, an icon given by the Span? iards to "Queen" Juana on her baptism in 1521, subsequently lost, and "miraculously" rediscovered in 1565. Enshrined in the city's San Agustin Church, it has generated a lore of disappearances and reappearances. Other cases of images lost and found include the discovery around 1570 of a mi? raculous statue of the Virgen de los Remedios in a well inside Fort San Pedro (hence, its name Birhen sa Kotta, "Virgin of the Fort") and, in 1572, of a wood-carved relief of the Ecce Homo in an old Cebuano burial site. These stories of disappearing images have a mundane interpreta? tion. These were relics brought to Cebu in the Magellan expedition of 1521, lost in that interregnum when Cebuanos reverted to their old relig? ion, and recovered after the return of the Spaniards in 1565. The problem however is not quite so simple. These are not common objects but relig? ious symbols charged with meaning. The Spaniards interpreted the finding Dr. Resil B. Mojares teaches in the Departments of History and of Language and Literature at the University of San Carlos, Cebu. He can be contacted at &lt;mo jares@skyinet.net&gt;.</page><page sequence="2">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 139 of these images as a "good omen" in their mission of conquest and con? version and proceeded to encourage a cult of devotion around these sym? bols. How Cebuanos themselves saw these images is more problematic and less accessible. Even so it is clear that these accidents of appearance and disappearance were freighted with a great deal of mystical and politi? cal meaning. The tradition that grew around these images is not the simple story of an object lost and found but one that unfolds ? like faith itself, and history ? as dynamic and disjunctive, and involves symbolic slippages, contested meanings, and associations with antecedent symbols "already there" even before the Spanish coming. This play of knowledge and belief suggests that one can trace the genealogy of religious objects and in this manner construct not only the history of a thing but the sociohistorical field in which symbolic artifacts are circulated, elaborated, suppressed, neglected or revered. This is what I shall attempt to do by taking the intriguing case of another Cebuano religious icon, the Virgin of Guadalupe in the barrio (ba rangay) of Guadalupe in the western suburbs of Cebu City. It is an ex? tremely "thick" case for several reasons. It has a long history that reportedly dates back to the sixteenth century; it implicates the story of other religious symbols; and it is embedded in an indigenous tradition of an earth goddess that antedates the introduction of Christianity. II A foothills community seven kilometers from the center of Cebu City, the barangay of Guadalupe has a Marian shrine as its focal symbol. The foundation narrative of this shrine is invoked as the charter narrative that provides the community with an "origin" and a symbol of coherence. Local tradition claims that Guadalupe had its beginnings at the time of Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi's arrival in the Philippines in the sixteenth century.1 The Spanish takeover of the port of Cebu in 1565 destroyed houses, scattered the population, and sparked a war in which Cebuanos carried out raids and tried to starve out the fledg? ling Spanish camp. As time passed however, Tupas, the leading Cebuano chieftain, accommodated himself to the Spaniards and was baptized as a Christian. Cebuanos who remained unreconciled to the Spanish intruders fled to the foothills ? to what was then referred to as Tagoon ("hidden"), Tagoan ("hiding place"), or Banawan ("flood drain") - and there built a</page><page sequence="3">140 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY community of "free men" outside the control of Tupas and the Spaniards. To suppress the community, Tupas and his warriors engaged the recalci? trants in a bloody battle. Outnumbered, the rebels surrendered to Tupas and to his and Spanish rule. Augustinian missionaries baptized the people in the rebel district and gave them a statue of the Virgin Mary as a reward and symbol of their new religion. Not long after, however, the people "forgot the statue." It was stored inside a "corn hut walled with carabao skin" and was only dis? covered because of a strange happening. At night, people saw light shining from the hut and, in the morning, found dogs that had died from trying to eat the carabao hide. This occurrence revived the people's fervor for Ca? tholicism and they built a chapel for the statue. Subsequently, "Moro pi? rates" attacked the barrio and residents hid the image in a nearby cave but eventually again forgot about it. It is surmised that those who hid the im? age, to save it from being profaned, were carried off by the pirates or killed. Thus, the image could not be located. (Relocating the event to an? other time, another version relates that the image was hidden to prevent the Spaniards from taking it away during the "Filipino-Hispanic conflict.") The image was rediscovered when a trapper (mangangati) of wild cocks, looking for a lost fowl, sought shelter in a cave in the middle of a storm. In the dark of the cave, he found an image "illumined by a bright and mysterious light." The trapper brought the image to the Spanish priest in the town of San Nicolas, to which Guadalupe then belonged. It was en? throned in an ermita (chapel) in the barrio but when this chapel was de? stroyed by a typhoon (another version says it was torched in the Filipino American War), the image was transferred to the San Nicolas Church. For years, it was the practice of the people of Guadalupe, when celebrating their fiesta on the feast day of the Virgin (December 12), to take the image in a procession from the San Nicolas Church to the barrio at the beginning of the fiesta and then return the image at the end of the celebration. On one of these occasions, as the image was being taken back to San Nicolas on an andas (pallet), the statue fell. (Another version says it "jumped.") The people marveled that it fell standing on the ground, facing Guadalupe. They took this as a sign that the Virgin wished to remain in the barrio. Thus the statue came to be permanently enthroned in the barrio chapel. This pastiche of stories is variably told by local residents, simpli? fied or elaborated according to the number of reiterative episodes of loss and discovery, hiding and finding. It constitutes what may be called an "official" foundation narrative since, with the variations alluded to, it is a</page><page sequence="4">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 141 story that has been written down by priests or published in novenas, the popular nine-day prayerbooks that are, for the faithful, the "official" and often the only available written text on the local patron or image. It is a variable, shifting narrative in its surface details, a feature familiar in oral traditions as well as indicative of the fact that, even today, it is a founda? tion narrative that has not quite assumed stable, canonical form. In the main, it circulates today in the fluid, piecemeal form of the vignette, frag? ment, and episode, rather than in the form of a full and rounded narrative. A literary version of this origin-story written in 1955 absorbs (in more transparent fashion) elements from the foundation narrative of what is said to be the prototype of the Marian image the Spaniards gave to the village, the famous Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico (Rama 1955). This version narrates how a beautiful woman "clothed in a sheer, white cloud" appeared to a poor trapper named Juan Digo in a cave where he had sought shelter from a heavy downpour. That night, an old woman came to Juan's house, instructing him to tell the friars in the town what he saw and that it was the desire of the woman in the cave that a church be built in the village. To convince the friars that a miraculous apparition had taken place, the old woman gave Juan a "fragrant scarf filled with flowers that would not wither." Juan did as he was told but the friars thought the trapper was mocking them and threatened him with a whipping. Juan ran away without having shown the scarf. That night, the old woman appeared again and told him to tell the friars to go to the cave where the "Virgin" (Ulay) would be waiting for them. If they refused, they would not be able to come to the village "to talk to Tupas" because the way would be flooded, the mountain springs would overflow and drown them in a flood. This time the friars, exasperated, consented to go to the cave. What they saw struck them with such amazement, they fell to their knees in prayer. Juan saw the beautiful woman who had appeared to him, "clothed in transparent, fra? grant vapor, surrounded by flowers, illumined by a mysterious light." Af? ter commanding the friars to build a church in the village, she vanished. A church was built but when the friars came with a religious icon to place in it, they found already enthroned on the altar "a black image of the Virgin" adorned with wild flowers from the surrounding fields. In time, however, the church fell into neglect because the rich people of the locality used it as a storehouse for crops and stable for sheep and goats. Angry, the Virgin sent a fire that destroyed the chapel but left her image unscathed. Hence, the residents built a new chapel in what is now the pre</page><page sequence="5">142 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY sent location of the Guadalupe Church. The cave itself was regarded by the people as a sacred place where pilgrims could find an image of the Virgin outlined in the stone, curative water flowing from a spring, and the footprint of the old woman who was the Virgin's mysterious messenger. This version connects the narrative to the first days of Christiani zation by alluding to Rajah Tupas but borrows ? unconsciously and with? out acknowledgment of the fact ? from the Mexican foundation narrative in the name given to the trapper (Juan Digo, after Juan Diego, the Aztec commoner to whom the Virgin appeared in Tepeyac in 1531) and the mo? tif of the scarf filled with flowers (after the tilma, the Aztec working apron made of maguey fiber, on which the image of the Virgin miraculously ap? peared). It diverges from the Mexican model in such details as the figure of the old woman-messenger, the motifs of flood and fire, the miraculous spring, and, most important, the stone image in the cave. Threading through this and other versions is the reiteration of the appearance-disappearance motif, the sacralizing of place, the privileging of the role of Church and clergy, and the compounding of story elements of ambiguous meaning. Narrated in a manner that blurs the limits of syn? chrony and diachrony, it ties the narrative to liminal episodes in Cebuano history (Spanish conquest, "Muslim" piratical raids, the revolution), de? ploying a symbol that unites or telescopes more than 300 years of history. For many, it suffices that it conveys the semblance of a linear, pro? gressive, and "marvelous" narrative that begins in the past, unfolds into the present, and gives to the present (and the community sharing the story) its charter. Still, despite the will to be purposive, it is a narrative shadowed by the play of the indeterminate and accidental. While foundation narra? tives aspire to the character of inevitability, of what is preordained, the historical reality they draw from and embody is quite entangled. Ill Michel Foucault warns the stalker of origins: "Genealogy is gray, meticulous, and patiently documentary. It operates on a field of entangled and confused parchments, on documents that have been scratched over and recopied many times" (Foucault 1977: 139). The genealogy of the Virgin is a more complex palimpsest than what is so far suggested. Complexity resides not just in the variable stories told about its origins but in the gaps and contradictions of the "historical" record. It inheres in the Virgin both as discursive creation and material</page><page sequence="6">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 143 reality. It is plausible that the Guadalupan image was indeed introduced in the sixteenth century. It has been argued ? mainly by Mexican historians ? that the Augustinian Andres de Urdaneta brought along an imagen (im? age) of the Mexican Virgin of Guadalupe in the Legazpi expedition from Mexico to the Philippines in 1564-65 and that this image was left in Cebu.2 These sources however are discrepant on the kind of image intro? duced. A Mexican account relates that after the Cebuanos fled to the foot? hills in the wake of the Spanish landing, Urdaneta and the missionaries went forth unarmed, bearing a standard with a painting {pintura) of the Guadalupan Virgin of Mexico. Upon seeing the painting of "a chaste maiden dressed in a modest rose-colored tunic and a mantle the color of the sky, her face humbly inclined and her hands prayerfully put together," the Cebuanos lost their fear, came out of their hiding places, and slowly approached the friars. Thus the Cebuanos were won to the faith (Beltran 1982: 87-88).3 Whether there was an image of the Mexican Virgin, and in what form, is not easily clarified. Until the end of the nineteenth century, much of the history of the Guadalupe area has gone unrecorded. This is not sur? prising. In maritime Cebu and much of the country, "history" hugs the coast; a few miles inland and it is terra incognita. The first recorded refer? ence that I have to the barrio under its present name, Guadalupe (which nominally suggests the presence of the image), is in 1751, when Guadalupe is listed as a visita (a subparish unit) of San Nicolas (Pedro Es pineyra OS A cited in Rodriguez 1984: 182; see also Buzeta and Bravao 1851: 66). Records also mention the building of a chapel in Guadalupe in 1886, a structure of bamboo and nipa palm (cana y nipa), under the parish administration of Spanish Augustinian Jorge Romanillos, who is credited with having improved the road and planted coconut trees in the barrio (Mercado 1933a: 21,24).4 Beyond these bits of information, we know little of the early history of the community and its Marian image. The case of the Virgin, however, confronts us not so much with the problem of what the "facts" were (which would be, in themselves, quite barren) but how folk knowledge works. In Guadalupe, the theophanic event is entangled in obscure mediations. It is an appearance densely con? taminated rather than immaculate. The claim of "origins" for the Guadalupe icon is grounded in a preexistent, indigenous pattern of folk belief. Christian images in the Philippines were "inserted" into a culture with a tradition of sacred ico</page><page sequence="7">144 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY nography (Ocampo 1965, Gatbonton 1979: 12-16). Precolonial Filipinos had religious images of wood, stone, and other materials, called likha (in? vention), larawan (image), or landong (shadow). Sculpted animal figures or anthropomorphic representations, these were placed in makeshift shrines in fields, riverbanks, or caves, and to these images propitiatory rites (animal sacrifices, food offerings) were made. It is not difficult to conceive that the Guadalupan image was absorbed into an older system of iconic practices (as has been cited, for instance, in the better-known case of the Santo Nino in Cebu: Tenazas 1965: 36, 54n, 55). More important, the idea of the image-in-the-cave fits into a matrix of indigenous beliefs in territorial spirits and demideities inhabiting such places as mountains, rivers, and caves. The Virgin's "appearance" in Cebu could not have been disassociated from an existing complex of legends about an earth goddess. A myth widely diffused in the Philippines, it tells of a female deity who inhabits a cave (mountain, forest) and is regarded as a supernatural provider who periodically appears and disappears, a god? dess of fertility who once inhabited the mountains and has now vanished. This legend is popularly identified with the figures of Mariang Makiling and Maria Cacao (Album 1980, Mojares 1988, Olofson and Uy 1989, and Seki 2001). A version reported for Guadalupe is that of a "golden woman" who lives "inside the mountain," weaving golden fiber on a golden loom, appearing in a realm radiant with gold-hued work implements, household articles, and playful animals (snakes, lizards, freshwater eels). In narrative fragments that have survived in Cebu, the disappearances of this deity are associated with such causes as the violation of certain interdictions, in? gratitude of local dwellers (who "borrow" from the cave articles they need but neglect to return them), or the intrusion of irreverent strangers.5 While the "official" Guadalupe foundation narrative is silent on the Virgin's indigenous antecedents, it recalls stories, known in other parts of the world, in which a pre-Christian goddess is displaced by, or trans? formed into, the figure of the Virgin Mary. In legends widely distributed in Europe between the ninth and thirteenth centuries (and, later, in Latin America), Marian images are miraculously discovered in caves, ponds, streams, or trees. The discovery is often made by a shepherd, cowherd, or farmer, aided by animal-helpers and such signs as a vision, strange light, or celestial music. Part of this thematic pattern is the repeated return of the image to the site of its discovery after it is relocated to the town or church. While these legends have been traced to their "root paradigm" in the birth of Christ (shepherds having a vision, going on a pilgrimage, finding the</page><page sequence="8">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 145 Child in a cave or manger), they are embedded in pre-Christian myth (Turner and Turner 1978: 41-44, Christian 1981: 75-91).6 In the Philippines, stories of Christian images appearing, by acci? dent or miracle, mark early accounts of Christianization. The impulse to authorize or naturalize the faith by ascribing to it early origins is conveyed in narratives that either trace a sacred image to the very beginning of Christianization or claim that it was "already there" even before the Spaniards came. Examples are the oral traditions surrounding such Marian images as the Nuestra Senora de Guia in Ermita (Manila), Nuestra Senora de la Pazy Buen Viaje in Antipolo (Rizal), Nuestra Senora de Caysasay in Taal (Batangas), and Nuestra Senora de Poon Bato in Botolan (Zambales) ([Congregantes Marianos...] 1906, Mercado 1980: 55, Bunuan 1997).7 In the lore about these images, the association with fertility cults is indicated by motifs of the image being fished out of the river or sea or found in a tree or cave, and the belief that these images were already there when the Spaniards came. The theme of antecedence is also illustrated in the case of the Santo Nino of Cebu, around which there is the lore that it is a piece of "marvelous wood" that was cast ashore or fished out of the sea and was the object of devotion from times "immemorial" (San Agustin 1998: 338 339, Russel 1907: 119-130, Tenazas 1965: 56-57). In Cebu, as elsewhere in the Philippines, caves were imagined as sacred spaces. A survey of Cebu in 1886 reported a number of caves on the island that had the remains of what were believed to be pre-Hispanic human burials (Abella 1886: 89-90). The legend of "mountain goddesses," who inhabit caves and are a source of both gifts and retribution, is reported in Carmen, in northern Cebu, where there is the story of the Virgin Mary, in the form of a scapular of the Virgin of Carmel (Birhen sa Carmen, hence the name given to the town), antedating the Spanish arrival (Lavilles 1965: 67-68). The association of a Marian shrine with a cave is also illus? trated in the case of the Virgen de la Regia (Virgin of the Rule) in Opon (Lapulapu City) about whom it is told that beneath the church where she is enshrined is a cave with healing waters, the narrow passageway to which is now long closed (Anonymous 1983: 16-17, 18-19; Aviado 1975: 33-39; Bunuan 1997: 22b). Old Guadalupe residents believe that their cave is connected by a subterranean tunnel to the cave in Opon and that the Vir? gins of Opon and Guadalupe are "sisters." (In the folk's ludic imagining, it is told that the Opon Virgin is dark because she spends a lot of time swimming in the sea whereas the "fairer" Guadalupe Virgin is a country maiden sheltered by mango trees.)8 These stories recall for us the myth of</page><page sequence="9">146 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY chthonic goddesses and "Black Virgins" in other parts of the world (Begg: 153-293). Given the lack of local data, this is a theme that will have to be explored more fully elsewhere. It suffices to underscore that the Christian image was not introduced into a vacuum and that, from the very begin? ning, its identity was compromised and ambivalent. IV The myth of the cave goddess has been erased in the official foun? dation narrative in Guadalupe. In modern Guadalupe, this narrative has functioned as a myth of Catholic-colonial origin, absorbed into a Marian meta-narrative that sanctifies a place and a community by the appearance of a sign of Christian redemption. History begins with the Spanish coming and the "seduction of savages" by the Christian Virgin. The image in the cave originates as a Spanish gift. However, the Christian imagen itself is distinctly unfocused and unstable as a sign. Christianity introduced a whole pantheon of images dense and polysemic in its visual properties and internal relationships. The figure of the Virgin Mary is particularly fecund and many-layered. Mary is not only the titular patron of over one-fourth of Philippine parishes, cele? brated in numerous feasts in the Catholic calendar, she appears in a wide range of titles or "guises" (Anonymous 1975).9 Her image is, "next to the Crucifix, the most frequently depicted object in Filipino sculpture" (Anto linez n.d.: 51). Marian iconography tends to be fluid as there is a range of symbols ? crescent moon, sun, stars, angels, scepters, colors ? shared by the Virgin's many guises. Church officials are divided as to whether the image found in the cave in Cebu represents the Virgin of Guadalupe in Spain or the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico. The former refers to the image enshrined in the Royal Monastery of Guadalupe, a celebrated pilgrimage center established in 1340 in Extremadura, a province in the eastern sierra of Sp?in. The lat? ter is the image from the famous Marian apparition of Tepeyac (in what is now Mexico City) in 1531, in which, among other miraculous events, the image of the Woman who appeared to the Indian commoner, Juan Diego, materialized "divinely painted" on his apron, the tilma. A popular account claims that when the statue was first shown to the Augustinian friar in San Nicolas, he identified it as a replica of the Guadalupan image of Extremadura (Arepal n.d.). The oldest extant Ce buano no vena to the Guadalupe Virgin in Cebu, dated 1881, identifies her</page><page sequence="10">THE VIRGIN OF GUAD ALUPE 147 with the Spanish Virgin (Anonymous 1881a). It is likely that throughout much of the Spanish period, the local image was identified with the Virgin of Extremadura. This association may explain the animal motifs in the Ce buano narrative (cock, dogs, carabao hide) as the product of contagion from a Spanish source. On the other hand, there were those who believed that the image was "a copy, though not exact," of the Mexican Virgin (Anonymous n.d.: 3, Anonymous 1935ff). It appears, however, that it was only after 1900, when control of the San Nicolas parish passed from the Spanish Augustinians to the Filipino secular clergy that the Church "offi? cially" took the statue in Guadalupe to be a representation of the Mexican Virgin. This debate may have been remote to many of the devotees in the village. After all, the core plot of the Spanish, Mexican, and Cebuano ori? gin-stories is stable: a woman-deity appears to a commoner in a cave or hill, in a vision or the form of a material icon, and signifies that a church be built at the site of her appearance. (See Appendix for these origin sto? ries and a comparison of motifs.) It is the charter of a Christian commu? nity, one that authorizes a mission of conversion, foretells its fulfillment, and privileges the role of priest and church. The genealogical question, however, is not entirely academic since it determined the particular ways in which the image was represented by priests, its official interpreters, to the community of believers in sermons, devotional texts, and liturgical practices. Identification of its genealogy informed how the story of its origin was told, what particular lessons were drawn from it, how the symbol was explained and embellished, and what kinds of devotional or ritual practices were encouraged. Semantic instability is shown in the textual representation of the Guadalupan image in novenas, prayer manuals intended to codify for the faithful the origin and meanings of the divine patron and its representation. The available novenas in Guadalupe indicate that the code has not been static. The 1881 no vena, earlier referred to, links the Cebuano Virgin to the Virgin of Extremadura by presenting the foundation narrative of the Extremaduran image. It makes no reference either to the Mexican or Ce? buano histories of the image. It foregrounds the noble lineage of the Spanish image (its connection to Pope and Spanish royalty), dwells on the grandeur of the Extremaduran shrine (enumerating the rich gifts given to the shrine by kings and princes), and calls on the Cebuano devout to dem? onstrate the same devotion the Spaniards have shown so that they, too, can partake of the Virgin's graces. In contrast, a 1994 novena orients the im</page><page sequence="11">148 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY age to the Mexican model. While it localizes the image by adding the Ce buano origin-story to the Mexican story, the exegesis of doctrine as con? tained in the prayers is wholly oriented to orthodox Marian dogma and the lessons of the "canonized" Mexican narrative (Anonymous 1881b: 420 428, Anonymous 1994).10 In stressing the Virgin's encounter with a sim? ple Indian peasant, however, it departs from the 1881 novena (with its fo? cus on the grandeur of the image and the duties of the faithful) by humanizing Mary as refuge for the poor and afflicted in her role as Medi? atrix and Mother. Iconography further illustrates the fluidity of the image. Local tra? dition has conjured up the Virgin of Guadalupe in various ways: as an ap? parition, a painting, a rock formation, and a wooden statue. As a wooden statue ? the form in which it is now commonly known ? it is ambiguous. The earliest photograph of the image comes from a catalogue of Marian images in 1904 which says that the icon is morena (brown) and one meter high.11 It was a wooden carving in the round with sculpted details in the robe, and (as present-day informants recall) was a stylized representation of an angel with a crescent moon in the statue's circular base. (We cannot tell from the black-and-white photograph whether the statue is polychro? matic.) In its basic form, it evokes the Virgin of the Immaculate Concep? tion, the most popular Marian representation in the country, also considered the iconic model of the Mexican Virgin of Guadalupe. The Ce buano statue differs from the Mexican Virgin in such aspects as the set of the head (straight in the Cebuano version, tilted to the right in the Mexican model) and the position of the hands (set slightly apart instead of joined). It departs from the Extremaduran Virgin in more significant ways. It is fairer in color and more "Oriental" than "Athenian" in facial features. More basically, the Extremaduran Virgin represents Mary in the guise of Mother of God and Queen and is thus shown seated with the Child Jesus on her lap and her right hand holding a scepter (for descriptions of the Spanish and Mexican virgins, see Garcia and Trenado 1978: 349-383, Garcia 1985, and Rodriguez 1994: 19-30). The practice of "dressing up" an icon further complicates the Vir? gin's visual presence. In the 1904 photograph, she is crowned and framed by a detached, apparently metallic arc signifying rays of light. Alterations and accidents have since changed the image. The crown and arc have been replaced by newer ones. The horn-like protuberance at the base of the statue, signifying the crescent moon, was removed, and the base itself re? placed. At one time, the Virgin's hands were shown holding flowers (a</page><page sequence="12">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 149 Mexican motif) or a white handkerchief; now they hold a scepter. Her face has been retouched, giving it a fair look, and she is now dressed, in Ex tremaduran fashion, in an ornate robe. While there are parishioners who think this "make over" means a loss of authenticity or is an unseemly dis? play of feudal ostentation, ornamenting an image (even applying "make? up") is a common practice, variously explained as a way of honoring the image or demonstrating the status of church and community (or that of the icon's patrons and custodians). This practice makes the Extremaduran model seem more congenial than the fixed and relatively unchanging im? age of the tilma in Mexico but then even the latter has not been exempt from human additions to the divinely manifested image (Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate 1997: 58-61). The sculptor's craft, embellishment, and exigencies of statuary damage or loss of parts "individualize" images. Though it is the intention of the Church for sacred images to have a semiheraldic, stereotyped char? acter, icons tend to be idiosyncratic, localized and personified because of their material particulars (color, clothes, accessories), whether the product of design or accident. In this manner, they take on "a life of their own" apart from what may be their original or intended meaning, fostering ten? sions between the idol, as the iconic image of some immaterial original, and the insistent materiality of the fetish (Spyer 1998). Hybridity in textual and visual representation opened up an area of multivocality in the ways the Guadalupan image was perceived by devo? tees. In a semantic field in which motifs and details coalesced, displaced, or collapsed into each other, those who regulated the faith (priests, cate chists) could select and heighten those elements they deemed relevant and useful, and delete or suppress those that were hostile and inconvenient. At the same time, of course, the faithful themselves could disentangle, com? bine, or imagine elements of the image according to their own desire. We have to pay attention not only to the essentializing and codifying strategies of the dominant but the creativity of the faithful's simplifying and mean? ing-making moves. This is not mere interpretive play. Issues like the Spanish-Mexican controversy are not just stylistic or theological but latently, if not overtly, political. Ramon Pedrosa, a modern advocate of the Mexican Virgin, writes that the Spanish friars "had no intention nor desire to promote" a devotion to the Mexican Virgin in the Philippines (Pedrosa 1995: 31-33, 37-38). While he offers no explanation (and little proof) for what he calls the "deliberate silence, even hostility" of the Spanish friars to the Mexican</page><page sequence="13">150 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY image, one can suggest a number of reasons. The experience of colonial Mexico showed how the Virgin could be appropriated as an oppositional sign. Since the Indians saw the woman who appeared in Tepeyac as the Aztec earth goddess Tonantzin, the Virgin became a symbol of nativism. Since she was viewed as indigenous rather than foreign, she became the emblem of a militant Creole nationalism.12 Compared to the politically and theologically problematic Mexican image, the more distant Virgin of Extremadura ? with a noble "lineage" that goes back to no less than St. Luke and a Pope ? was the safer symbol. Political implications can be drawn as well from the indigenous Christian ambivalence in the case of the Cebuano image. Like the Mexi? can Tonantzin, the woman in the Cebuano cave appeared in a liminal phase of conquest and conversion. Embedded in her narrative are the same values as are represented in the Mexican icon: linking past and present, bridging cultures, dignifying the native and commoner, and nurturing the promise of liberation from anxiety and oppression. The presence of a hy? brid, overdetermined image confounded essentializing strategies, unsettled borders, and opened up novel spaces for the construction of agency. V The genealogy of the Guadalupan icon carries us not to the stabil? ity of an "origin" and a fixity of meaning but a state of chronic indetermi? nacy, the chimerical play of a shifting narrative shaped by the invasions of multiple traditions and realities. It tempts us with Foucault's notion of "transgressive history": "What is found at the historical beginning of things is not the inviolable identity of their origin; it is the dissension of other things. It is disparity." (Foucault 1977: 142) One finds in the story of the Cebuano Virgin not just a disparity in surface details but a ground in which meta-narratives have shifted. In the myth of the earth goddess there is a sign of an edenic unity that is, at the same time and always, present and absent in the vagaries of the sacred in human life and in the conflictual flux of people's relations with nature and supernature. These relations in early times were imagined to be direct, in? timate, and unmediated. Precolonial society had shamans, healers, and other religious specialists whose religious practice gravitated towards the local, dispersed, and decentered. The cave goddess signified a curative presence at once specific and diffuse, a presence potentially available to anyone with the requisite knowledge, virtue, and skill.</page><page sequence="14">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 151 The twin processes of colonization and Christianization suppressed memories of the connections of a presence-in-the-cave with a mythic past and the land. The official Guadalupe foundation narratives make no refer? ence to an indigenous "prehistory." There are ambiguous elements in the local myth of origin - the black icon decked with wildflowers, the death of ravenous dogs, the mysterious woman-messenger ? spectral traces of "other stories" and interpretive possibilities that have not come into full play. The persistence of these traces undermines the wholeness of the dominant narrative, yet they have remained traces. The local myth is buried, overlaid by a Christian narrative more structured and didactic. The deity is materialized as a Marian icon, con? firmed by priests, enthroned in a church, and absorbed into a "universal" religion that unites Spaniards and natives alike, and Christians every? where, since this deity found in a small cave in Cebu is the same deity who appeared on a barren hill in Mexico and in another cave in faraway Extremadura. The symbolic field, however, remains fluid. Speaking of similar stories in Latin America, the anthropologist Michael Taussig points to their restless, volatile creativity (he felicitously calls them "Virginal histo? riography"). While commonly encountered as a myth validating the origin of colonial society, the myth "allows the originary point to slide or skip through time to represent different events." In this manner the Virgin "serves as a mnemonic for focal points in social history," a function that "replenishes the present with mythic themes and oppositions set into se? mi otic play in the theater of divine justice and redemption" (Taussig 1987: 197). These Indian-manifested saints and the particular twist in their story of discovery constitute a map of redemption across the land. Each twist is like a signifier, dependent on the map as a whole to make its meaning. Each pilgrim with each pilgrimage is like an act of speech, bringing that meaning to concrete actuality (Taussig 1987: 188). Semiotic play is occasioned by the common structure of founda? tion narratives. Episodic, anecdotal, and open-ended, they allow space for additions, deletions, and improvisation. New experiences can be incorpo? rated into the narration, motifs are borrowed from other origin stories in a process of "contagion," and the "story" is typically told in broken, piece? meal fashion. While the institutionalizing of shrines (by shrine patrons or church authorities) creates pressures for "fixing" the narrative, the narra? tion almost always remains unstable. The idea of an ''original" or "basic"</page><page sequence="15">152 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY story, Barbara Herrnstein Smith argues, is hypothetical, "a Platonic ideal form: unembodied and unexpressed, unpictured, unwritten and untold" (Smith 1981: 212). All stories are versions driven by particular motives and purposes. The motifs of a "black virgin" appearing in a wild place to a na? tive-commoner can be deployed as counters in a politics of race, class, and space. Depending on the selection and arrangement of story elements, the narrative can be shaped to highlight the agency of the native and the moral ascendancy of the margin (cave, barrio) over the center (the pueblo). It is to a poor trapper that the Virgin appears; it is in the color of his race that she manifests herself; and it is a "wild place" she chooses as her home. It is a native woman she sends as her messenger; it is the rich who profane her chapel; and it is the Spaniards who attempt to steal an image that is the natives' own. The ambiguous and unintegrated elements in the local myth of ori? gin are signifying "twists" that may have been more distinct and active in times past. The flood-motif in the 1955 version ? in which skeptical friars are threatened with punishment if they do not come to the cave ~ is asso? ciated with Cebuano legends in which mountain deities exact tribute (bu his) or retribution by sending a flood to claim lives.13 It illustrates a theme, albeit submerged, in which the prime mover of the action is the land and its spirits rather than the missionaries. In the postcolonial Cebuano "map of redemption," however, the sign of the Birhen sa Langub (Virgin of the Cave) remained occluded. De? spite its reputed antiquity, miraculous powers, and subversive potential, it has been marginal in the social and religious history of Cebu. VI In tracing the history of sacred objects, we have to move beyond the artifact and return to the story of the community itself. The power of a relic resides in its community of believers and the dialectic in which one is empowered by the other. As Taussig reminds us, it is not the image which is active (a notion that is fetishistic) but "the community of persons among whom the image exists, the community of persons doing the imagining and therewith bringing the image to life over and over again" (Taussig 1987: 198). A full analysis of the politics of signs must account for the specifi? cities of the icon's shrine (that sacred site represented by a church, moun</page><page sequence="16">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 153 tain, or cave), community (the locality or patronal domain over which the deity presides), "catchment" (the wider territory from which it draws devotees and pilgrims ? see Sallnow 1981: 166, 178), and the even broader, less bounded spaces (region, nation, world) in which shrine, community, and catchment are enmeshed. On all these levels, the location of the Guadalupe Virgin has been as problematic as her image. There is the matter of the Virgin's peregrina? tions. One assumes that the Spanish missionaries resisted the idea of the cave as a sacred site, with its associations with "pagan" beliefs and prac? tices. Conversion involves not just a conversion of people but spaces. "Unclean," heathen spaces have to be exorcized, purified, and sanctified with the enthronement of a Christian deity. While Marian symbolism has strong associations with the cave and the values of a sheltering, womb-like passage it evokes, the cave, too, harbors the danger of alternative mean? ings. In many cases in the Philippines, this problem of "converting" space (see Remensnyder 2000) was solved when the missionaries built churches either at the site of the tree, adjacent to the river or sea, or (as in the case of Opon's Marian shrine) atop the cave that was considered the deity's abode. These were not ready options in the case of Guadalupe because of the cave's inhospitable location. A small cave (with a capacity of not more than twenty people at a time) on the side of a ravine overlooking a narrow river, it was located in a rugged, thinly populated district. Sources suggest that at various times ? perhaps in the mid eighteenth century when Guadalupe already had the status of a vistta, and in the late nineteenth century ? the image was enthroned in an imperma? nent chapel in the village. This was built on a riverbank close to the cave before it was moved (due to chronic flooding, it is said) to its present site in the village center. The unsettled conditions of the area, however, were such that through much of the Spanish period (and as late as 1904) the icon was kept in the parish church of San Nicolas some four kilometers away, "visiting" the village only on its annual fiesta. These relocations form part of the subtext of the myth of the "vanishing" deity. The power of the Guadalupan icon is not only compromised by complication, it is at? tenuated by absence. The transfer of the Virgin from cave to church created a split be? tween two shrines: cave and church. While the earliest written reference to the cave as a pilgrimage site that we can find is dated 1904, it undoubtedly functioned as a separate, even oppositional shrine over a much longer pe? riod. The removal of the image did not disenchant the cave. A shrine grew</page><page sequence="17">154 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY around certain signs inside the cave, a miraculous spring and a rock for? mation that (a pilgrim in 1980 said) "looks like the Virgin carrying a child," and, at the cave entrance, a footprint that, devotees said, belonged to that mysterious woman messenger in the shrine's legend ([Congregan tes Marianos ...] 1906: 145, Alesna 1980). The cult of the Birhen sa Lan gub had a devoted following but remained informal and covert. Pilgrims came not only from the locality but distant places to light candles, pray, and collect the spring water that was believed to cure illnesses when drank or massaged into the body. Stories of miraculous healing kept the cave devotion alive. Located less than two kilometers from the village center, the cave was a shrine at the margin of a community in the margin. The village of Guadalupe lies in a cul-de-sac where the road from the city ends and the mountains begin. It does not lead anywhere, except for those going upland by way of narrow foot trails. Perhaps as early as the erection of San Nico? las as a parish in 1584, Guadalupe functioned as an outpost for religious, military, and civil work in the city's western outskirts and the uplands. It remained backwoods country however until the end of the nineteenth century. This is shown in the petition of the principales (leading citizens) of San Nicolas, on 28 October 1878, urging that the barrios of Guadalupe and Labangon be separated from San Nicolas and converted into a separate town.14 Making Guadalupe-Labangon a town, it was argued, would en? hance civil and ecclesiastical control in a district that had been neglected because of its distance from the town center. Such neglect had left the area in a "primitive state" with respect to religion and had made it, because of its proximity to the mountains, "a refuge of vagabonds and people of evil ways." Conversion into a town, the petition said, would address "the ram? pant criminality that is now noted in the said barrios." A review of the petition, which was rejected by the Governor General in Manila, indicated that behind this attempt to hive off Guadalupe-Labangon was a state of discord between these inland barrios and coastal San Nicolas, which, because of location, controlled access to the resources of fishing and trade. With 1,503 tributaries (tax-eligible adults), Guadalupe and Labangon, on the other hand, encompassed poor, mountainous land, had few resources, and were locked into a dependent relationship with the town. Coast-inland tensions are a defining theme in Cebuano history. Colonialism sharpened these tensions, particularly in the nineteenth cen</page><page sequence="18">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 155 tury, as lowland-upland spatial distinctions were weighted with cultural, political, and economic differences. As the 1878 petition indicates, Guadalupe was a site of such tensions. Authorities viewed its mountainous district as a stamping ground for animists (diwatahan), vagabonds (vaga mundos), fugitives, and bandits. These tensions came into sharp relief during the anti-Spanish revolution (1898) and the war against the Americans (1899-1901) when the province of Cebu experienced not only an anti-colonial war but a state of insurrection in which long-simmering tensions between center and margins, landlords and peasants, town-dwellers and mountain folk were played out in acts of rebellion and social banditry. From 1898 until 1906, the mountains behind Guadalupe were what the authorities called a "dis? turbed zone." This mountainous zone witnessed battles and skirmishes, famine, disease, and the forced reconcentration of the mountain population carried out by the U.S. Army as an anti-insurgency measure in 1905 (Mo jares 1976, 1999: 175, 191ff). Unfortunately, we have little information about the religious sym? bolism of folk and peasant resistance in the central Cebu mountains during these years. Animist rituals and symbols figured prominently in the revo? lution and it was in the Guadalupe-Labangon area that the Katipunan revolutionaries assembled prior to their entry into the city on 3 April 1898. I have found no reference, however, to the Guadalupe Virgin in relation to these events though there are scattered, passing references to revolution? aries invoking the patronage of such Cebuano religious symbols as the Santo Nino and the Vir gen de la Regia (Mojares 1999: 164-165, Abellana n.d.: 14-15,61). Guadalupe residents recount that in the 1903 cholera epidemic that swept their community (and other parts of Cebu), the epidemic stopped when the Virgin's image was taken out on a nightly rogation procession around the village. (This tradition has been preserved to this day in the an? nual Thanksgiving Feast, Piyesta sa Pasalamat, observed in Guadalupe every July 16.) It was an efficacious image and it may have figured in the idiom of resistance in the Guadalupe environs during the revolution. Yet, the Virgin does not seem to have been prominent as an organizing, oppo sitional symbol on a scale wider than the village of Guadalupe itself. VII To better understand the Guadalupan cult one has to situate it</page><page sequence="19">156 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY within the larger political and religious geography of Cebu. Even as the myth of the cave is a symbolic resource for a marginalized mountain population, the island of Cebu does not have the depth or breadth to sup? port powerful mountain goddesses. An elongated island only 24 miles at its widest, its interior is mostly made up of meridional ridges, 400 to 900 meters in elevation, and a highly dissected, particularistic pattern of val? leys, rivers, and streams. The natural catchment of the Virgin's shrine is the Guadalupe River watershed at the base of which the main village settlement lies.15 It is just one of eight watersheds formed by mostly minor rivers that descend from the central cordillera into Cebu City and its adjacent towns, and thus one of several access points to the uplands. The early establishment of the village made it, theoretically, a focal point for much of the western periph? ery of the city. This wider zone however was rugged and sparsely popu? lated. The first modern census of 1903 identified only five barrios in the upper reaches of the Guadalupe River, north and west of the main barrio settlement, with a combined population of 1,606.16 Guadalupe itself re? ported a population of 1,834 in 1903. Resource-poor and fragmented, the Guadalupe area did not have the makings of a theater in which a powerful, oppositional myth could flourish. Throughout its history, Guadalupe has been subordinated to other places, to San Nicolas (of which it was a barrio until 1901 and a visita un? til 1933) and, more important, the city of Cebu, the island's political, eco? nomic, cultural, and religious center (to which it was incorporated when San Nicolas lost its status as a town in 1901). This dynamic of subordina? tion is expressed in the relationship of the Guadalupe Virgin to the other religious symbols of this wider district. When Guadalupe was part of San Nicolas, the Virgin was ancillary to the patron of the parish, San Nicolas de Tolentino. More important, it has been subordinated to the Santo Nino, symbol of the primary cult of devotion among Cebuanos. Enthroned in the city, in the Augustinian church that was a center of ecclesiastical influence in the Visayas throughout the colonial era, the Santo Nino is the region's dominant religious icon. Moreover, the Guadalupan image is not as well known as its "sister," the Virgen de la Regia. The port location of the lat? ter's Opon shrine, across Mactan channel from Cebu City, makes it a "natural" point of convergence in a maritime environment like the Visayas. Both the Santo Nino and the Virgen de la Regia have been canonically confirmed as high images of the Church. The canonical status of the Guadalupe Virgin, on the other hand, remains ambiguous and con</page><page sequence="20">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 157 tested. The "sacred geography" of Cebu (and the Visayan islands in gen? eral) is decentralized and more maritime-oriented than land-based. It is not in the order of pilgrimage systems in Latin America (or, in the Philippines, the Southern Tagalog region). While the tension between coast and mountain runs through local history, the mountains of Cebu have not been a deep and effective base of power. Caught between mountain and plains, the Guadalupan cult is more peripheral than oppositional in its relationship to the high religious images of the city. We do not have here the phe? nomenon witnessed in Mexico in the symbolic opposition of the "Mexi? can-insurgent" Virgin of Guadalupe and the "Spanish-loyalist" Virgin of Remedies {Virgen de los Remedios) (Kurtz 1972: 205-206; Turner and Turner 1978: 62-76, 90-95). The devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe is an obscured, largely undocumented cult. Ceremonial symbols are not highly elaborated and a rich devotional literature has not been generated. Pilgrims come from dis? persed, largely disconnected places, bound together by individual experi? ences of an icon and a cave rather than by ethnic, class, or territorial identities. Guadalupan miracles consist mainly of stories of personal healing. Compared to the more expansive, communally oriented miracle discourse of the Santo Nino, the Virgin's interventions tend to be special? ized, localistic, and private (on the Guadalupe miracles and the current status of the cult, see Mojares 2000). In the present century, Guadalupe has been slowly transformed into a quiet, pastoral suburb of the city. The suburbanization of the village has blurred its physical, social, and moral boundaries, and weakened its distinctness as a community. Since 1933, parts of its extensive territory have been carved out to form new barangays and parishes. Postwar ur? banization has seen its population grow from 7,160 in 1939 to 16,938 in 1970 and 40,629 in 1990. Transformed from inland outpost to urban dor? mitory, Guadalupe has filled up with new residents without memories of the place and the Woman in the Cave. The present century has also seen attempts at domesticating the cult of the Virgin. In 1933, Guadalupe was established as an independent parish, with the Virgin enthroned in a new, modest church of concrete. The identification of the image with the Virgin of Guadalupe of Mexico received a boost in 1935 when Pope Pius XI declared the Mexican Virgin "Patroness of the Philippines." Local residents celebrated the occasion with a ceremony on their December 12 fiesta that year in which the local</page><page sequence="21">158 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY image was "crowned" by the provincial governor of Cebu. Church authorities, however, quickly pointed out that this coronation was "private, local, and parochial" rather than "official or canonical" (see Anonymous 1935a, b, c, and d). There were reasons for the diffidence of church offi? cials. Guadalupe was not only a minor parish; doubts persisted as to the "real" identity of the image. As early as the 1930s, moves were taken to incorporate the cave shrine to the parish center. It became the practice during the December fiesta to take the image of the Virgin on a dawn procession from the parish church to the cave and back. On one hand, people interpreted the proces? sion as an affirmation of the originary power of the cave. On the other hand, it was viewed as a rite that subordinated cave to church, turning what had previously functioned as an autonomous shrine into a sub-parish devotional center. By the 1950s, occasional masses were celebrated in the cave and, in the years that followed, the "satelliting" of the cave progressed (though unevenly and contentiously) with the organization of a cofradia (a parish based lay association) that organizes and supervises devotional activities in the cave shrine. Roads were built to link the cave more closely to barrio center and city. In time, regular masses were celebrated in the cave even if, officially, the cave remains to this day what the Church classifies as a "private oratory," space not owned and blessed by the Church and in which no liturgical acts are to be performed. The institutionalizing of the cave continues to this day but so does the debate on the genealogy of the image that, tradition says, was found there centuries ago. The cave re? mains, as with shrines elsewhere, a "realm of competing discourses."17 The signs of an ancient theophany have disappeared. Due to severe erosion in the district the spring inside the cave has dried up and there is now nothing to be seen of what the pilgrims of old saw, the face of the Woman in the Stone and the footprint of her messenger. It would seem that the cave, disenchanted, has been emptied of the significations it once had. VIII Human creativity is not unfettered. There are "conditions of meaning" that restrict even as they also generate the production and cir? culation, range and efficacy, of meanings.18 While local imagination was not a vacuum, indigenous, precolonial</page><page sequence="22">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 159 idols on the island of Cebu (and in the Philippines for that matter) did not have the well-developed symbolism of Aztec or Inca divinities. Conditions of geographical and political particularism in precolonial times inhibited the advance of a broadly translocal or transregional ritual system or hier? archy of religious specialists. Conversion under colonial rule carried with it the sweep and force of dogma and orthodoxy. Symbolic play was re? stricted by catechisms, official shrine narratives, approved liturgies and texts, sermons by priest-interpreters, rules of iconographic presentation, and a system of moral and material sanctions and rewards. The history of the Cebuano Virgin of Guadalupe is marked by am? biguity, absence, subordination to other symbols and shrines, and, most decisive of all, a social location in which significant power could not be accumulated. It is a story that reminds us that the power to generate meanings, or make them general, is not wholly free nor equally distrib? uted. Symbols become efficacious not just because of their material prop? erties nor by how they are imagined but who does the imagining. Yet, it is a story that reminds us as well how human creativity, like the vanishing deity it conjures up, keeps bursting forth in the cracks of dominations. The fact is that the Virgin has remained polysemic, elusive, and uncontained. In the unstable, contradictory versions of her genealogy is a refusal of fixed origins, and an appearance of spaces in which people can define and appropriate history in their own terms. In the ubiquity of her myth - for this is a story told not only of this place but other places ? is a dream of continuing possibility. When I asked a village resident whether he had heard the story of the mysterious woman who once appeared in the cave of Guadalupe, he said no but, yes, he knew the story of such an apparition in another cave, deeper inland. Such stories will continue to be told. APPENDIX FOUNDATION NARRATIVES19 Virgin of Guadalupe in Cebu After Legazpi and his soldiers landed in Cebu, the inhabitants fled to the mountains and hid in a place called Tago-an. Five Augustinians went to the mountains, converted the inhabitants, and gave them an image of the Virgin Mary as a sign of the amity in which the missionaries were</page><page sequence="23">160 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY received. Since the people did not quite know what it meant, they kept the image in a hut where carabao hide was stored. The inhabitants were amazed that in the darkness of night a bright light could be seen shining inside the hut. In the mornings they saw dogs that had died because they could not extricate their teeth from the hide they tried to eat. These strange happenings moved the people to accept the Catholic faith. No one can tell when and how it was that the image was found in the cave. According to some village elders, the residents hid the image in? side the cave during a Moro raid to save it from being profaned, and that perhaps those who hid it were either abducted or killed during the raid. Others say it was during the revolution against the Spaniards that the resi? dents hid the image in the cave. It is told by the old folks that after the passage of years the image was found by a trapper of wild chickens. He was driving a stake into the ground to tether a domesticated chicken for bait and, as he was doing this, what turned out to be a guano pit came loose and revealed the image. The image was brought to the parish priest of San Nicolas who declared that it was a replica of the Virgin of Guadalupe of Mexico. The happy news spread throughout the towns and made numberless devotees to the Virgin. A church of nipa-and-bamboo was built where devotees praised the Virgin without cease. Due to the difficult condition of the cave and the road leading to it, the parish priest of San Nicolas had a church built in a place called Kina sang-an, west of the cave, and here the image was enthroned. Because this could be reached only by crossing a creek easily swollen by floods, the church was relocated to the site where the church of Guadalupe now stands. Virgin of Guadalupe in Spain Tradition says that the original image was buried with St. Luke in the first century, came into the possession of Pope St. Gregory the Great, and was famed for such powers as ending an epidemic that swept through Rome. The Pope gave the image to St. Leander, Bishop of Seville, and it manifested its power by calming a storm in the voyage from Rome to Spain. It was venerated at Seville until the Moorish invasion of 711 AD when clergymen, fearing for the safety of the image, hid it in a cave where it was eventually forgotten. In 1326, in the mountains near Caceres (in the</page><page sequence="24">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 161 province of Extremadura), a herdsman named Gil Cordero was looking for a lost cow. Finding it dead, he was about to skin it when the cow came back to life and the Virgin appeared. The Virgin told the herdsman where her statue would be found and commanded him to tell the people that she wished a church built in that place. Upon his return to the town, the herdsman found that his son had died. When the priests came to his house to minister, the son returned to life. It was then that the herdsman reported the apparition. The statue of the Virgin was found in the cave as she had indicated and the people built there a chapel that eventually became the famous Guadalupan shrine of Extremadura. The cave was located on the banks of the river Guadalupe, a word which literally means "Wolf River," probably because this was an area that had been infested with wolves. Hence, the name given to the image. Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico On 9 December 1531, a poor Indian peasant and recent Christian convert named Juan Diego was on his way to church when, passing Te peyac hill (now part of Mexico City), he heard sweet music and a woman's voice calling him by name. Ascending the hill, he saw a young woman surrounded by a radiant halo of light. She told him to tell the Bishop what he saw and that it was her wish that a church be built where she had appeared. Juan went to see the Bishop but was rebuffed twice, and each time the woman appeared to Juan again, telling him to convey the message. On the third visit, the Bishop asked for a sign to convince him that Juan was telling the truth. When Juan saw the woman again and told her about what the Bishop wanted, she told Juan to return to the hill the following day. Juan was unable to do so because he found his uncle dying when he reached home. On December 12, he went to fetch a priest for his uncle but, passing the hill, he saw the woman again. He told her of his predica? ment. She told him not to worry as his uncle will not die. She told Juan to go to the top of the hill. There Juan found roses blooming though it was not the season and the soil was barren and rocky. He gathered the roses in his working apron (tilma) and brought these to the Bishop. As he spread out the tilma before the Bishop, the roses cascaded out and revealed on the cloth, miraculously painted, the image of the woman on the hill. All who saw the image fell to their knees in prayer. Upon his return home, Juan found his uncle well and the latter de</page><page sequence="25">162 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY clared how a woman appeared to him and told him everything that hap? pened. It is said that the name Guadalupe was given to the woman who appeared at Tepeyac because Bishop Juan de Zumarraga (1468-1548), the Franciscan friar to whom the apparition was reported, misinterpreted as Guadalupe the Nahuatl word that the interpreter said was how the woman called herself, Coatlaxopeuh ("She who crushes the serpent").

Mercado, the parish priest of San Nicolas (1909-1942), laid the foundation for the establishment of Guadalupe Parish. Other accounts also probably based on Mercado are Anonymous (1994) and Arepal (n.d.). The war between Tupas and the people of Guadalupe is narrated in the popular account of Labra (1939); see also Anonymous (1932b). A novena (Anonymous 1989) claims that the image of the Virgin was "brought by Magellan to the Philippines." 2 A Mexican historian says that the Virgin of Guadalupe was patroness of the Legazpi voyage and that Urdaneta (who first arrived in Mexico in 1540 when there was popular fervor over the Tepeyac apparitions) was steeped in Guadalupan devotion. Cuevas theorizes that the image of the Mexican Virgin must have been placed in the chapel Legazpi erected in Cebu (Cuevas 1943: 202, 214-218, 220, 223, 233, 259-260). ?^Sources for the account are not cited. Local tradition in Guadalupe has preserved the name of a little-known historical figure, Makiyong (Makyo, Maquiong) as one of the first Christian converts in Guadalupe. He was the Cebuano leader, probably the brother of Tupas, who offered his services to Legazpi after his wife and two daughters were captured by the Spaniards (San Agustin 1998: 380-425, Scott 1986). A local source narrates that Makiyong and Kahukom were the couple the Augustinians baptized as Romualdo and Cleofe and after whom Guadalupe got its first name, Maldope (after the last syllable of their Christian names) (Mercado 1934, Anony? mous 1994: 2). ^Romanillos came to the Philippines in 1873 and served in San Nicolas from 1813 to 1898 (see Perez 1901: 576). An obstacle to local archival research was the loss or destruction in World War II of the Catholic parish records of San Nicolas and Cebu City. 5The reference to the "golden woman" is in Genson (1937), and for references to the cave-motif elsewhere in Cebu, see Bas (1939). The theme of a paradisal realm of gold is found in the Sinukuan and Makiling legends of Luzon (Alejandrino 1996 [1891], Natividad 1912). 6An excellent study of a Latin American case is Watanabe (1990). ^On the transformation of fertility goddesses into Virgin Mary or a Christian saint, see Preston (1982) and Berger (1985). ^Interviews with Zosimo and Trinidad Labra, Guadalupe, Cebu City, 30 July 1999, and Msgr.

The Virgen de la Regia has a tradition similar to that of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Introduced by the Augustinians to Opon in 1735, the Opon Virgin is a replica of an image traced to a fifth-century, dark-colored icon that belonged to St. Augustine, was moved from place to place, hidden in a seaside cave in the Moorish invasion of 711 and then forgotten, rediscovered in 1330 through a dream of an Augustinian friar, and enthroned in Chipiona, Andalucia, Spain. ^"Guises may be drawn from incidents in the subject's mythico-historical biog? raphy, or they may celebrate some facet of the subject's qualities, or they may com? memorate a divine apparition at a certain spot, the dedication of a church or any other anniversary somehow associated with the personage in question. Each of the more widely recognized guises has come to be depicted by a specific iconographic type" (Sallnow 1981: 180). l^See the Cebuano sermon in Anonymous (1881b: 420-428). As a model for the analysis of this type of literature, see the hermeneutic study of the case of the Nuestra Senora de Caysasay of Batangas in Rodriguez and Rodriguez (1996). 11 See the photograph facing p. 50 in [Congregantes Marianos...] (1906). An? other photograph is on the cover of Lungsuranon for 16 October 1935. l^The literature on the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico is vast (see Wolf 1958: 38 and Kurtz 1982). In the Philippines, the bitter conflict within the Augustinian order between pen? insular friars (those who took their vows in Spain) and Creole friars (those who entered the Order in Mexico) from the 1590s to the 1630s may be relevant to the politics of these images (see Phelan 1959: 35-37, 41-42). l^The flood-motif appears in stories of Maria Cacao, a Cebuano cave goddess, and in a legend which explains the name of the Buhisan Mountains near Guadalupe by telling of a deity who exacts tribute (buhis) by sending a flood to claim lives (see Mer cado 1933: 28-29, Alburo 1980). ^Philippine National Archives, Ereccion de Pueblos, Cebu 1831-1894, Bundle # 85, Legajo #83, fol. 246-306b, "Expediente sobre la ereccion de los barrios de Guadalupe ye Labangon...," 28 October 1878-9 to June 1879. l^For a topographic description of the area, see Abella (1886: 39, 59) and Area Research and Training Center (1990).</page><page sequence="28">THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE 165 l^See Oficina del Censo de los Estados Unidos (1905), Volume II, p. 166. Population figures may be understated because the census was undertaken in a time of war. l^The notion of the shrine as a realm of competing religious and secular dis? courses is a dominant theme in the "post-Turnerian" anthropology of pilgrimage (Eade and Sallnow 1991). "I draw the notion of "conditions of meaning" from Dubisch (1995: 164ff). 19See Anonymous (n.d.), Garcia (1985: 4-13), and Johnston (1985: 45-48).
