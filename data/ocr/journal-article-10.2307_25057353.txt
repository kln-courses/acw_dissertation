<plain_text><page sequence="1">JANIE hinds SUNYBrockport Deb's Dogs Animals, Indians, and Postcolonial Desire in Charles Brockden Browns Edgar Huntly In a well-known passage in Charles Brockden Brown's Edgar Huntly, the title character, through a misplaced do-gooder instinct, has followed mysterious stranger Clithero Edny into the "regions around Nor walk," has found his "benevolence" rejected and, frustrated, has returned in his sleep, fallen into the pit of a dark cave, killed and eaten a panther, clawed his way out, and on the way home, stumbled on a crude "hut" (206) in the middle of nowhere, with freed captive girl in tow, to shoot and kill some four?or is it five??Native American men who he assumes have murdered his family, or his friend, or in any case bear murderous intentions toward himself. An unsettling couple of days. Shortly after this moment of high stress Edgar learns whose cabin he has used as both refuge and staging ground for his killing spree. The cabin belongs to Old Deb, also known as Queen Mab, an old friend. Here is how Edgar describes her: sovereign matriarch, relocated but "not forgotten" by her "countrymen," the Lenni Lenape or Delaware, Deb had held her ground when all other tribe members had abandoned, due to "perpetual encroachments of the English colonists," their "ancient seats" (207) some 30 years prior to this story of ongoing frontier conflict. Only two years earlier, Deb had relocated, but only into an isolated, secondhand cabin in the woods, where relatives now visit annually and where she subsists on the produce of her garden and the spoils of her dogs' hunting. Situated as she is both in and out of the Lenni Lenape tribe, Deb has habits that are a peculiar mix of tribal custom, English borrowing, and her own oddities, many associated with her dogs: Her only companions were three dogs, of the Indian or wolf species. These animals differed in nothing from their kinsrfien of the forest, but in their attachment and obedience to their mistress. She governed them {323</page><page sequence="2">EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 with absolute sway: they were her servants and protectors, and attended her person or guarded her threshold, agreeably to her directions. She fed them with corn and they supplied her and themselves with meat. ... To the rest of mankind they were aliens or enemies.... They would suffer none to approach them, but attacked no one who did not im prudently crave their acquaintance, or who kept at a respectful distance from their wigwam. (207-8) Deb appears but briefly in Edgar Huntly and is commonly viewed as less than central; in a novel whose title character is also the first-person narra tor, all events focus around Edgar Huntly, according to the critical tradi tion. However, Deb holds a crucial place in Edgar Huntly s enactment of colonial and postcolonial desire, and her significance is marked by her ap pearance at the important juncture at which Edgar finds himself stripped of friends, humanity, and even his identity. Critical appraisal of Deb has tended to focus on her ethnic and racial characteristics: Brown presents her, says Robert Newman, as a crazy old woman representative of her tribe in what amounts to an "Indian-hating" novel. She is, at the other extreme, a sovereign leader, resistant to English colonizing and a force to be reck oned with: Brown, Matthew Sivils writes, "did not create this character to be ignored" (303). In these and many other readings, character Edgar Huntly's views?whether taken to be Indian-hating or Indian-loving?are conflated with author Charles Brockden Brown's views, an unfortunate confusion in view of the fact that Brown constructs Edgar as a "somnam bulist," an unreliable first-person narrator so frequently on the verge of madness, or at least subject to altered states of mind, that Edgar has little moral authority in the novel as a whole.1 Most persuasive because most complex are Sydney Krause's and Jared Gardner's studies of Deb and the other Delaware in Edgar Huntly. Krause indicates a deeply embedded racism manifest in the character Edgar and possibly going beyond the character to Brown's own role in creating Edgar and the novel's Native Americans; Krause does, on the other hand, draw important distinctions between author and character on the subject of race. Gardner extends this analysis of race in Edgar Huntly somewhat further, viewing its Indians not as merely symbolic of the Anglo Edgar's psyche, as has been too commonly the case, but as representative of contempo rary anxieties surrounding aliens as evidenced by the Alien and Sedition</page><page sequence="3">Animals in Edgar Huntly {325 Act of 1798. Importantly, both Krause and Gardner recognize Deb as not only a representative Native American but also a roundly realized charac ter who participates in Delaware tribal, in English colonial, and in her own isolationist practices. My purpose is to strengthen these heterogeneous readings of Deb, Ed gar, the Delaware, and the novel by opening up a line of reasoning pre viously invisible in the study of Brown's novels. I will return to the racial and ethnic focus later, but I will begin by exploring a question more perti nent to Edgar Huntly than we have heretofore allowed?namely, what are those dogs doing in this novel? More globally, why does Brown deploy ani mals so robustly here, and why, ultimately, are the animals in Edgar Huntly liminal members of their species? I will also address the human animals in Edgar Huntly and their status as liminal or borderline creatures, with regard to both their own and other species. Natural science and natural history were of considerable concern to Brown and his circle, including but not limited to the Friendly Club of New York, and I hope to make the case that in this fermentive period during which boundaries among species and among "races" were being multiply shifted, questioned, and redefined, Brown found occasion to test the limits of Enlightenment possibility re garding human transformation.2 Historicizing the material presence of taxonomically disruptive figures in the eighteenth century and in Edgar Huntly, I explore historical events and issues surrounding Brown. Edgar Huntly's aesthetic configurations of animals, Indians, and storytelling within the narrative reference eigh teenth-century debates among natural historians regarding "race" and species, along with the discursive ground on which the debates were per formed; Edgar Huntly offers to enter those debates via Brown's dramatic rendering of Euro-American taxonomic issues. Guided by F?lix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze's anti-symbolic theoretical discourse on borderline and pack animals, I draw on postcolonial and Second World critical theory to read Edgar Huntly's Deb as a colonized indigenous figure caught in a dis cursive matrix of colonial and postcolonial desire. Related to but distinct from so-called Third World postcolonial discourse, Second World narra tives are those from authors during what Edward Watts describes as the "decolonizing" historical periods of the United States, Australia, New Zea land, and Canada (Watts 2). Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tif fin in the groundbreaking The Empire Writes Back describe these particular</page><page sequence="4">326} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 decolonizing places as "settler colonies," as does Alan Lawson: indeed, The Empire Writes Back argues that the "first postcolonial society to develop a 'national* literature was the USA," and that in their attempt to form a "distinctive American literature in the late eighteenth century," authors confronted "inevitable questions about the relationship between literature and place, between literature and nationality, and particularly about the suitability of inherited literary forms"?that is, confronted postcolonial issues (15). "Writers like Charles Brockden Brown, who attempted to in digenize British forms like the gothic and sentimental novel, soon realized that with the change in location and culture, it was not possible to import form and concept without radical alteration" (15). These settler colonies, as Lawson succinctly puts it, are "colonized at the same time [they are] colonizing" ("Comparative Studies" 157); "land was occupied by European colonists who dispossessed and overwhelmed the Indigenous populations. . . . [Settlers] dealt with their sense of displacement by unquestioningly clinging to a belief in the adequacy of the imported language" (Empire 24), such that Second World narratives speak, in Lawson's terms, in "two lan guages," of "two histories" in a "dual inscription of incompatible geome tries" ("Cultural Paradigm" 73). As Deb's character is revealed more three-dimensionally, Brown-as author emerges as reconstructing late eighteenth-century racial discourse in a "Second World," postcolonial context. Edgar Huntly's decolonizing intricacies?what Lawson would term its "states of interphase" among colonizing and colonized discourses ("Cultural Paradigm" 70) ?are evi dent at not only its geographical but also its taxonomic frontier. The most powerful release of the indigene's voice is in the presence of hybridity, which threatens the hegemonic forces of categorized identity; Old Deb's hybrid status, reinforced by the animal hybrids of Edgar Huntly and to some degree Edgar's own borderline behavior, invokes a multiplicity of self-identity and relations among the characters in partial challenge to tax onomy's species and racial imperialism. Charles Brockden Brown offers, as a Second World author, a critique of character Edgar's colonizing narra tive in the figure of Deb: attention to language, speech, and speechlessness occupies the thematic drama of taxonomy in this novel, and consequently, the issues of "race," species, and postcolonial desire are mutually defined and performed around and through discursive history and its absence. "Talk" operates here as an absent presence of Native American history in</page><page sequence="5">Animals in Edgar Huntly {327 this novel in which a "minor" but central character does manage to "tell" a story, but whose story is largely silenced by the narrative: to hear Edgar tell Deb's story, it is told only to the animals. ANIMALS Most influential in the period of natural history immediately prior to and during Brown's lifetime (1771-1809) was the work of Carl von Linn? (Carolus Linnaeus), the Swedish botanist most fully responsible for focus ing the attention of the Euro-American world on "scientific" taxonomies. Though by no means the first taxonomy of species, it was Linnaeus's clas sification of plants and animals that formed the international language by which species are still known today. Linnaeus's work followed centuries of natural history which had been approaching purely physical system atization of species, as opposed to metaphysical and even allegorical tax onomies. As early as Aristotle's Historia Animalium, species were seen to have physical features in common, yet even medieval bestiaries used non human species primarily to allegorize the human condition: "The world was a cryptogram full of hidden meanings for man," writes Keith Thomas (64). By mid-eighteenth century, however, Linnaeus had revolutionized prior taxonomies with his "sexual" system of plants, a method supported by the same empiricism that drove many other "classifying" projects of En lightenment science, like Boyle's experiments with gases, or Franklin's with electricity.3 Yet here at the historical point of greatest faith in reason and empirical observation, designed to combat mythological, theological, and allegorical readings of nature, many of the West's inherited views of species remained in play. We do well to remember that in this transitional phase, taxonomy was infused with live traces of natural philosophy's past, such that it was always already inflected by more folkloristic readings of transformation among species. Linnaeus was emblematic not only of the rage for clear tax onomy but also of the period's discursive and classificatory crossovers be tween older, more anthropomorphized and allegorical views of nonhuman species and the newer empiricism. Rather than completely "demystify a world previously populated by superstition and fabulous creatures," Lin naeus himself clung to "fragments of folklore" (Broberg 177), believing that mermaids could exist, that swallows wintered under the surface of lakes,</page><page sequence="6">328} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 and that among humans there prevailed several distinct species (including Homo Africanus, Homo Asiaticus, Homo Europaeus, and Homo America nus) with different characterological as well as physical features. Taxon omy's wider cultural and popular cultural presence, as a result, featured both emphasis on clarifying boundaries among species and transgression of boundaries in what appears to be an energetic assertion of "unscientific," even mysterious, potential for singular identity.4 That Brown was aware of these shifting taxonomies is beyond doubt. His article "The Difference Between History and Romance," published in the April 1800 issue of The Monthly Magazine, indicates that he had read both Linnaeus and his French counterpart, the Comte de Buffon.5 His closest friends were intimately involved in reading natural science and natural his tory. Not a close acquaintance of Brown's but known within and impor tant to the Friendly Club circle, Dr. Benjamin Rush lectured and published medical commentary that depended strongly on his choice of taxonomies; in discussing aspects of the mind, Rush returned repeatedly not only to the linkages between the mind and the body but also to the differences and similarities among both races and species. As did most eighteenth-century taxonomers, Rush was at pains to distinguish human from beast at every opportunity. In his published Lectures on the Mind, he claimed the "erect form" of the human distinguished it "from every other animal upon the globe" (70). Rush, like most taxonomers, found lack of speech in animals a key ingredient in their difference from (and inferiority to) humans. And yet, as if to testify to a shifting of boundaries between human and animal species during his lifetime, Rush obfuscates these apparently clear distinc tions, as in this footnote: "I believe that animals, like water, earth and air, nay further, that the mind of man, are all moved only by their appropri ate stimuli" (78, emphasis added). Furthermore, "[i]n many animals we behold evident marks of understanding and passion. The bee and the ant exhibit many marks of the former, and where is the schoolboy that cannot bear testimony to the angry passions of a wasp?" (175). Like Linnaeus, Rush here anthropomorphizes so much that taxonomy, purportedly "scientific" and not a system of metaphors, loses its edge; both authors participate, even this late in the taxonomic project, in the assignment of fantastical properties to animals. Elihu Hubbard Smith, polymath physician and intimate of Brown, read Erasmus Darwin's Zoonomia, a primarily medical volume which also de</page><page sequence="7">Animals in Edgar Huntly veloped a philosophy of natural history, almost religiously during the years in which he and Brown spent a great deal of time together, conversing both privately and in the context of the Friendly Club meetings both attended sporadically. In his Medical Repository, Smith published part of Zoonomia and Darwin's The Botanic Garden, a poetic version of Linnaean taxonomy (Diary).6 Smith's interest in plants and animals focused on their medical lessons; he read Darwin for, among other things, directions on anatomy and medical cures. He read and visited with naturalists from the most re nowned to the more hobbyist collectors. Beyond the professional, Smith took an enthusiast's interest in species, particularly of the animal variety, even more of the peculiar, "monstrous," liminal examples. If an elephant or mammoth exhibit came traveling through New York (or Philadelphia, when Smith visited there), he was certain to visit; he was intrigued by and took seriously a "Learned Pig" on exhibit in New York; he even reports going to see an exhibit of a dwarf, a liminal example of human taxonomy in the view of eighteenth-century taxonomy.7 Smith's Diary records his activities but few of his thoughts on these mat ters. In the context of his natural history reading, however, it seems clear that the changing nature of classification spurred his interest in the limi nal cases. Like Rush, for whom taxonomy was not so strictly defined that it no longer required assertion now and then of distinction among species, Smith was drawn to "specimens" not easily classified in Linnaeas's scheme. That he persuaded Brown at least to consider natural history's new tax onomies appears likely when we consider Brown's placement of animals in Edgar Huntly, which he was composing in an early form as Sky- Walk during periods spent with Smith?in fact, composition of this unfinished novel was largely accomplished at Smith's New York home.8 Indeed, animals? and humans, I will argue later?in the finished Edgar Huntly participate in just the kind of boundary transgressions that interested Smith, either in their "natural" form, or by dint of a transformation from one "species" to another. The novel appears to feature a panther; yet that panther, for instance, turns out to be multiple, to be two panthers.9 Deb's dogs begin at the inter section of two species?wolf/dog?and by their constant interaction with Deb further toe whatever line between species could possibly warrant faith by this era of taxonomic change. These creatures communicate perfectly with Deb, and she with them. They do serve and protect, as canines are</page><page sequence="8">330} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 wont to do, but they do so, as quoted earlier, "agreeably." In fact, much of the language surrounding Deb's dogs is anthropomorphic; or put another way, they are associated with human motives, relationships, and opinions. They "supply" Deb "and themselves" with food; they "suffer" no one near; they demand a "respectful distance from their wigwam." And they do not simply attack; "they were aliens or enemies" to all humans other than Deb. The dogs seem to have come by these human characteristics by commu nication with or contagion by human contact: they have "kinsmen" who differ from them only in Deb's dogs' having learned to communicate and interact with humans (207-8). Animals in Edgar Huntly have been read, if at all, as symbolic extensions of Edgar's psychological state; the further Edgar progresses into the wilder ness, the more animal-like he becomes, perhaps by contact with those very animals he encounters there.10 Leslie Fiedler and Dennis Berthold con tend that just as Edgar becomes more wild the further into the wilder ness he proceeds, he becomes more "civilized" the closer to settled terri tory he returns (Love and Death 148-49; "Desacralizing" 129).11 While these nonhuman creatures do participate in the more general psycho-symbolic mythological tenor of the book, those readings, owing to an almost alle gorical take on psychosymbolism, ignore or supress a full spectrum of possible functions o? Edgar Huntly's beasts. Such unidimensional deploy ment of symbolism fails precisely when the vehicle of the symbol?the thing or subject itself ? transforms from one species to another. This is indeed the case with most of the novel's animals. Deb's dogs, in particu lar, are not just dogs, nor are they just wolves; then again, they are not humans, either. Occupying multiple taxonomic "slots," they are, rather, just what they are?not symbols attached to a single signification. Deleuze and Guattari theorize this issue beautifully in A Thousand Plateaus, insist ing that Freud erred in taking the Wolf-Man's story symbolically, in taking "wolves" to mean "wolf," and then translating the symbol into a transcen dental signifier: "Freud," they write (and I would add, the psychosymbolic readings o? Edgar Huntly), "only knows the Oedipalized wolf or dog, the castrated-castrating daddy-wolf, the dog in the kennel, the analyst's bow wow" (28-29). The Freudian wolf is thus dominated and domesticated by the symbol-making analyst (or literary critic). There is another, less allegorical method of reading animals, Deleuze and Guattari suggest, for though "it was already decided from the very be</page><page sequence="9">Animals in Edgar Huntly { 331 ginning that animals could serve only to represent coitus between parents," Deleuze and Guattari rupture the symbolism with a more syntagmatic reading: "Freud obviously knows nothing about the fascination exerted by wolves and the meaning of their silent call, the call to become-wolf " (28). The importance of the wolves is that they are multiple, that they oper ate rhizomically or across significations in a network with other like and unlike creatures, rather than singularly through a paradigmatic meaning. The "call to become-wolf" speaks to these crossover and transformative functions. I will adopt, then, Deleuze and Guattari's term "phenomenon of bordering" (246) to describe the human and nonhuman pulling away from particular species in Edgar Huntly into a liminal, one might say frontier, ground among multiple possibilities. Importantly, the resulting "multi plicity" (239) is not meant to invoke any specific communitarianism or group identity; indeed, multiplicity offers a counter to the kind of tran scendent identity?ethnic, racial, gendered, or otherwise?invoked in dia lectical identity politics. The border-cases in Edgar Huntly do have signi fying value, but that value is in the transformation, in their coming across to other species, which creates a resistance to strict taxonomy: a kind of deterritorialization was taking place in mid- to late eighteenth-century sci entific taxonomy while the new Linnaean system was taking root, and thus animals like Deb's dogs in Edgar Huntly operate within a phenomenon of bordering that includes humans as well. For it is not the animals alone that seem to morph from one species or kind to another. Clithero Edny, double though he is to Edgar Huntly, much more easily accommodates the wilderness than does the also-sleepwalking Edgar. Clithero "does not shy away from working as a servant," Gesa Mack enthum remarks, and he "survives alone in the wilderness for several days, is nursed back to life with the help of Native medicine, and finally inher its [Deb's] hut" (23). Mackenthum appropriately refers to Clithero as "a cultural mongrel," a combination Irish immigrant, New World inhabitant and participant in Native American culture. What's more, "after only a few days in the woods, the Irishman seems to have turned into a wild man or even a werewolf" (25). Edgar transgresses some borders himself, growing as Fiedler and Berthold pointed out, increasingly "uncivilized," even "sav age," the further into the wilderness he proceeds. Edgar's transformation, both physical and spiritual/psychological, involves a change from a self proclaimed nonviolent soul to a man who can kill both animals and Indi</page><page sequence="10">EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 ans with only a twinge of guilt and, in the case of the panther, with appetite that is not merely physical: "My hunger speedily became ferocious. I tore the linen of my shirt between my teeth and swallowed the fragments. I felt a strong propensity to bite the flesh from my arm. My heart overflowed with cruelty, and I pondered on the delight I should experience in rend ing some living animal to pieces, and drinking its blood and grinding its quivering fibres between my teeth" (164). Edgar raises the issue, in fact, of shifting taxonomies by asserting his own distinction from the animals of the wild. Afraid to attempt a 30-mile journey home after his "adventures" in the wilderness, Edgar suddenly be comes squeamish (this, after eating the panther with "delight") about his own person: "In six hours it would be night, and, to perform the journey in that time would demand the agile boundings of a leopard and the inde fatigable sinews of an elk" (212). Edgar is both weaker than and superior to the animals; he continues: "I have ever aspired to transcend the rest of animals in all that is common to the rational and brute, as well as in all by which they are distinguished from each other" (212). This distinguishing impulse cannily echoes Rush, and indeed several contemporary taxonom ers. The human body, Rush wrote, "possesses animal life. But it does more. It perceives, it contrives ideas, it reasons, it judges: of course it possesses human life, that is, a thinking principle, called mind, united to a human body" (72). Perhaps Edgar is compelled to reassert his humanity because of his recent foray into the borderland of species. He has crossed over, to some degree, at least by ingesting raw panther; as the panther has become (literally) part of Edgar, so he has become panther as well.12 INDIANS As difficult, intractable, even "alien" as Deb appears to be in this novel, she even more than Edgar serves as a locus of border phenomena in Edgar Huntly, in terms of both species and race. This section of my argument will focus on the "race" issues that crept into Enlightenment species tax onomies, and here I will position Deb and Edgar Huntly's other Delaware characters within a discourse of the colonized indigene as they operate in the novel along a geographical frontier of English colonization as well as a narrative liminal-space between speech and speechlessness. Knowledge of Deb comes only from Edgar, whose narrative should serve as a case-study</page><page sequence="11">Animals in Edgar Huntly {333 in colonizing the racialized Other; given Brown's otherwise critical por trayal of Edgar?the somnambulist unknown even to himself, whose inter ventions in the affairs of others lead unfailingly to disaster?one can only conclude that Edgar's colonizing instincts come equally under Brown's critical eye, though Brown's deployment of hybridized racial figures may be disruptive of colonial discourse without offering the racial Other as more authentic or less disturbed than Edgar Huntly himself. Due to the combined colonial and postcolonial situation of Anglo/Native relations in both this novel and in the United States early republican era, I believe Sec ond World critical theory may fruitfully gloss the situation of language and storytelling in Edgar Huntly vis-?-vis the novel's border phenomena of human/animal and colonized/decolonizing characters. Written in 1799 (its predecessor, Sky-Walk, in 1798) and set in 1767, this novel straddles the bor der of postcoloniality with respect to England and the situation of Anglo America in the revolutionizing era of its setting. The Anglo settlers (like the character Edgar) were in a position of decolonization in the late eigh teenth century, a position that, as Steven Slemon writes, was "complicit in colonialism's territorial appropriation of land, and voice, and agency, and this has been their inescapable condition even at those moments when they have promulgated their most strident and spectacular figures of post colonial resistance" (110). Edward Watts comments that the "Second World text participates in the process of decolonization, then, by demanding that its readers initiate and engage the perpetual ongoing dialectic' between the colonized and the colonizing sides of their collective historical experi ence" (19). American Natives continued in the condition of the colonized long after European immigrants to the New World won U.S. sovereignty. In fact, as their own claims to sovereignty and independent nationhood were denied by the new American nation, their colonization as subjects within a foreign, sovereign nation took on a practically legal status within the "transatlantic European imperial world" (Richter 210). Separate sovereignty for Ameri can Indian nations was doomed by such configuring of argument as this statement by the Scots-Irish Prebyterian group known as the Paxton Boys: Mournful experience has convinced us that no nation could be safe especially in a time of war, if another state or part of a state be allowed to live among them, free and independent, claiming and exercising within</page><page sequence="12">EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 themselves all the powers of government, the powers of making war and peace, harboring and corresponding with the enemies of the state wherein they live, received their spies, given [sic] them intelligence, and furnishing them with the means of support and implements of war. (qtd. in Richter 202) That the "other state or part of a state" occupied by Deb and her nation amounts to land alongside the encroaching English creates an uncomfort able enough situation that Edgar Huntly, speaking for Deb, leaves as much of her voice as possible out of his history of the region. Indeed, it is symp tomatic of postcolonial if not Second World narratives in particular that marginalized figures "are usually left out of [official'] history" (Mustafa 15).13 However, recuperating Deb's story can be achieved, albeit carefully, through reading around and behind Edgar's colonizing narrative. In Edgar Huntlfs revisionist history of Deb's story, her voice and even her name, the latter buried too deeply under Edgar's majority voice to be fully recu perated, are all but lost.14 Himself in the "border" condition of the Second World settler, Edgar occupies the position of both colonizer and colonized. Lawson sees the "'settler' colony?indeed the settler subject?as a site of a very particular dual inscription," being colonizer and colonized at once ("Comparative Studies" 157). As Edgar's family has "relocated" the Dela ware in the past, Edgar has himself been likewise dislocated, first by the death of his parents at the hands of Natives and second by his loss of in heritance during the course of the novel; the Huntly family's land is itself threatened with Delaware reoccupation in the novel's present (the 1760s). Brown critically demonstrates Edgar's psychological degeneration through Edgar's retaliatory behavior: his language is more colonizing than colo nized as he clings to his "property" ?geographical and cultural?via nar rative control. Edgar rather high-tonedly ridicules Deb; indeed, he has to be reminded of her existence after he has left her cabin behind, though his history has long been entangled with hers. With a straight face, he glosses the his tory of Deb's and the Lenni Lenape's removal from their "ancient seat," without a clue that it is Deb's story?along with her legitimate complaints about colonial encroachment?and not Clithero's story, that provides the solution to the mystery of Waldegrave's death Edgar has been seeking this entire time. She cuts an absurd figure in Edgar's narrative, with her "pre</page><page sequence="13">Animals in Edgar Huntly tentions to royalty, the wildness of her aspect and garb, her shrivelled and diminutive form, a constitution that seemed to defy the ravages of time and the influence of the elements" (209). He finds her and her "pr?tentions" "a subject of mirth and good humour" (209). It is Edgar who has renamed her Queen Mab, to invoke her inconsequentiality. While Edgar takes quite seri ously the Native warriors he kills, he finds Deb, the stronghold, matriarch, and guerrilla warrior in her own right, not worth remembering except as an all-but-imaginary figure from his youth. And yet for all this, Deb's story is fairly transparent, behind or around Edgar's rendition of it: "She conceived that by remaining behind her coun trymen she succeeded to the government, and retained the possession of all this region. The English were aliens and sojourners, who occupied the land merely by her connivance and permission, and whom she allowed to remain on no terms but those of supplying her wants" (208-9). Dissoci ated from Edgar's mocking, Deb's reasoning is fairly sound: her extended family does, in fact, do her bidding, however infrequent their contact; of that the warriors who appear at her cabin testify. Brown demonstrates her concerns as legitimate, in spite of Edgar's narrative of the facts. The his torical Walking Purchase Treaty of 1737, the "encroachment" event alluded to in Edgar Huntly as taking place 30 years before the events of the novel, stipulated that English settlers would own as much territory as they could walk in a day; when the English hired professional runners to cover at least three times as much ground as a person could legitimately cover in walk ing, the Delaware became understandably hostile, not only about the loss of territory but about the colonists' trick. Deb's territorialism, as a result, is merely the mirror image of English colonial land-grabbing. Edgar, instead of recording her words, "edits" the story Deb might tell if her story were "transcribed" verbatim in the way that the stories of three white, male characters ? Clithero, Weymouth, and Sarsefield?are relayed by him.15 Edgar colonizes Deb's voice by summarizing her history himself.16 As a story?not as a set of facts but as a text overlayered by Edgar's ? Deb's history reinscribes itself partly in the attention to language and speech as sociated with her. While all of the Natives here are speechless, the fact of Deb's narrative silence strikes me as more than ordinarily strange, since a good bit of Edgar's history of her circulates around the issues of lan guage and speech. In younger days, when Edgar spent time with Deb, he learned "her jargon, and could make out to discourse with her on the few</page><page sequence="14">336} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 ideas which she possessed" (209). She, likewise, could converse in English, and in a manner of speaking verbalized, at least in the past, her culturally hybrid names. Most striking is the most obvious fact of speech in Edgar Huntly: though a character refused actual voice by Edgar's gloss, Deb is nevertheless most associated with talking: The chief emplyment of this woman, when at home . . . was to talk. Though in solitude, her tongue was never at rest but when she was asleep; but her conversation was merely addressed to her dogs. Her voice was sharp and shrill, and her gesticulations were vehement and gro tesque. An [sic] hearer would naturally imagine that she was scolding; but, in truth, she was merely giving them directions. Having no other object of contemplation or subject of discourse, she always found, in their postures and looks, occasion for praise, or blame, or command. The readiness with which they understood, and the docility with which they obeyed her movements and words, were truly wonderful. If a stranger chanced to wander near her hut, and overhear her jar gon, incessant as it was, and shrill, he might speculate in vain on the reason of these sounds. If he waited in expectation of hearing some re ply, he waited in vain. The strain, always voluble and sharp, was never intermitted for a moment, and would continue for hours at a time. (208) The "talk" Edgar summarizes but does not incorporate constitutes a trace of the "original" story; the desire to tell that story seeps through in the overflow of Deb's speech to her dogs. Racially Other, neither Deb nor the other Natives in Edgar Huntly have a first-person voice. Their silence has been remarked upon by crit ics since Leslie Fiedler; Krause describes Brown's Indians as stereotypes who "half-nakedly skulk around in the wasteland that is their natural habi tat... and who are not heard to utter one intelligible word, even in their own incomprehensible language, except for the 'mutter' or 'shrieks' they emit when mortally wounded" (370-71).17 As colonized indigenous figures, these characters are spoken for, as they are likewise grouped together in the narrative construction as a single body, any one of whom can be, finally, only representative and can be seen only through the story of the colo nizer. Deb, in spite of her difference from other Lenni Lenape, is treated with the same anthropological distance as the other Native Americans, all subject to generalizations of one sort or another, generalizations not un</page><page sequence="15">Animals in Edgar Huntly like those applied to animals as a category. For instance, Edgar reasons that he must remain perfectly still or risk his life, since "[t]he optics of a Lennilennapee I knew to be far keener than my own. A log or a couched fawn would never be mistaken for a man, nor a man for a couched fawn" (221). Like predator animals with highly developed olfactory abilities, the Delaware are here viewed materialistically in terms of visual acuity. Even retailing Deb's singularities, Edgar's narrative conflates her concerns with those of her "kinsmen": all of her interest, he reasons, must be territorial, her identity representative of the tribe. Deb is, in short, multiply hybrid: she is part of her tribe and she is re lated to the story's animals inasmuch as Edgar entangles the entire tribe's sensory attributes with those of predatory creatures. Deleuze and Guat tari's construct of "multiplicity" can be useful here in recuperating both the singularity of the hybrid and the collective of the group ? such as the Delaware in Edgar Huntly?in its invocation of "modal" as opposed to "molecular" being. The "story of multiplicity. . . the creation of this sub stantive marks a very important moment. It was created precisely in order to escape the abstract opposition between the multiple and the one, to es cape dialectics, to succeed in conceiving the multiple in the pure state, to cease treating it as a numerical fragment of a lost Unity or Totality" (32); instead, multiplicity operates to "deterritorialize," for members of multi plicities?of "packs" ?include both horizontal relationships and hierar chical ones, depending on time and need. In such a complex exchange between individual and group, the territory both "belongs" and does not belong. Importantly, as Nicholas Spencer explains, Deleuze and Guattari's con cept of multiplicity does not assert some apolitical postmodern evacuation of subject: rather, "when the human takes on the pack attributes of the ani mal, he or she is not reverting to a primitive mode but is participating in a mode of becoming that is the ever-present alternative that troubles State and family being_Becoming-animal thus leads to the formation of mi noritarian groups,' or oppositional subcultures" (198). Furthermore, "the critique of reason ... in Deleuze and Guattari's trajectory of becoming animal amounts to not a flight from political activism but an insistence on its virtual ever-presence in the midst of the molar [as opposed to mo lecular] world" (198). Such psychologically and geographically deterrito rialized yet political ground is made possible by transformation between</page><page sequence="16">338} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 and among races and species: "Lines of flight or of deterritorialization, becoming-wolf, becoming-inhuman [or -human] deterritorialized inten sities: that is what multiplicity is" (Deleuze and Guattari 32). Multiplicity moves between and beyond transcendent identity of either the individual or the group through the act of species- and race-bordering. It is in her multiplicity, hybrid and transformative, that Deb disrupts the colonizing discourse of Edgar Huntly. Brown's complex entanglement of the coloniz ing voice of Edgar and the colonized story of the indigenous Deb puts on exhibit both Edgar's tactics and Deb's intervention in that process of colo nization. If, as Lawson suggests, "the settler also exercises authority over the indigene and the land while translating" his desire for land ("Com parative Studies" 157), it is simultaneously the case that the indigene and her embedded story exercise the postcolonial gesture of intervention: with this interplay, Brown thus "engages with, resists, and seeks to dismantle the effects of colonialism in the material, historical, cultural-political, peda gogical, discursive and textual domains" ("Comparative Studies" 156). For a character so closely defined by her speech, the wonder is that Deb's language is not directly reported. Edgar allows her to speak, but only to the dogs. As a border-creature, operating in multiplicity, Deb does, how ever, get her story told, largely owing to her ability to practice multiple languages ? English, Delaware, and the inexplicable language she uses with her dogs ?and thus the trace of Deb's story seeps into Edgar's. "Second World creative texts," Watts writes, "very deliberately live double lives, wherein secondary narratives about the act of writing itself coexist with otherwise recognizable primary narratives telling a story about something else" (18). Thus in its attention to talk and storytelling, Edgar's imperialist historiography and the role of colonizing-by-history in Edgar Huntly tells two stories; or as Ashcroft describes postcolonial histories, "place" is "a palimpsest on which the traces of successive inscriptions form the complex experience of place, which is itself historical" (155). POSTCOLONIAL DESIRE Eighteenth-century taxonomy, not restricted to animals alone, fre quently obscured differences between human and nonhuman. Taxonom ers, concerned with "man's" position in the chain of being, differed on where to draw the line. Prior to the eighteenth-century classifications of</page><page sequence="17">Animals in Edgar Huntly {339 species, almost all nonhuman animal and plant species were placed at the service of humanity; by the eighteenth century, natural historians could either distinguish absolutely between kinds?animals, plants, and humans ? in a hierarchy, with humanity at the top; or they could read into the chain of being "that there were no breaks in the chain, but that each species im perceptibly moved into the next so that the line dividing men from animals was highly indistinct" (Thomas 124).18 Linnaeus inclined toward the latter view, often hinting that humans are simply and only animals,19 as did Rush upon occasion, as in his remark on the sameness of "stimuli" operating upon both animal and (human) mental activity. Important in the context o? Edgar Huntly is the fact that Rush, like many others, asserted that speech is unique to humans?that "if children were not taught a language of some kind, they would be found to convey their ideas like brute animals, en tirely by dumb signs or inarticulate sounds" (197). Newly volatile, in other words, was the definition of the difference between human and nonhuman even as the goal was to clarify those boundaries. Deb's communication with her dogs, along with her "silence" within Edgar Huntly's tale, places her in close association with the speechless brutes of natural history's careful categorization ? "like brute animals," the sounds she makes appear "inarticulate" in the narrative. Moreover, in the Euro-American taxonomers' view, nonwhite races frequently blended in, taxonomically speaking, with nonhuman animals, not least of all because of a kind of "speechlessness." Recall Linnaeus's four "species" of human, including the Native American Homo Americanus. Closer to home was Rush himself, whose writings about Native Americans evince a loathing that surprises modern readers, given Rush's energetic involvement in the New York Manumission Society. His "An Account of the Vices Peculiar to the Indians of North America" purports to "complete their natural history" by, in part, listing Native American "vices": "1. Uncleanness"; "2. Nas tiness"; "3. Drunkenness"; "4. Gluttony"; "5. Treachery"; "6. Cruelty"; "7. Idleness"; "8. Theft"; "9. Gaming"; and a tenth, unnamed vice, "the low rank to which they degrade their women" (151-52). There may be "virtues" among Natives, he remarks in passing, but he cannot but think they are "the qualities of necessity" rather than "the offspring of feeling, or prin ciple" (153). Like Edgar Huntly, and perhaps setting a precedent for Edgar's ruminations about general "Indian" qualities, Rush argues that "[t]he taci turnity of the Indians which has been so much celebrated, as a mark of</page><page sequence="18">340} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE*. VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 their wisdom, is the effect of their wants [sic] of ideas" (153). As animals lack speech, so do Indians; or rather, they approach incoherency of lan guage: "Even at public treaties, they grunt their assent to what is proposed to them, through their throats" (LOM 205). In a chapter of Lectures on the Mind supposedly about "The Facul ties and Operations of the Human Mind Which Distinguish Them From Those of Brutes," Rush performs a bizarre sleight of hand to equate Natives with "brutes," in a passage that slips between the one and the other with complete unself-consciousness: "Brutes have no signs, in monuments or books, to perpetuate their knowledge; and tradition is unable to supply their place. If it were, their knowledge would be limited and uncertain. This is evident, from the imperfect and contradictory histories which the Indi ans give of their ancestors; hence we derive another cause of the inferiority of the minds of brutes, to those of men" (546). Not only are Natives like animals, but, for Rush, they are animals; in some instances, they "rank" lower.20 The beaver and some other animals anticipate winter so far as to build nests in advance, Rush points out, but "[t]he Indians in the coldest regions of our country burn their cabins, and throw away their blankets in the spring, thoughtless of the use they will have for them in the ensuing winter" (LOM 543). Blatantly racist though Rush appears in this lecture, Brown, however, participating in a kind of taxonomic crossover of race and species in Edgar Huntly, held much more complex convictions on the subject of Native Americans than both Rush and the character Edgar Huntly. In the "Histori cal Essay" in the Kent State edition of Edgar Huntly, Krause suggests that it is not only Edgar who has racist views regarding Indians?Edgar's as sumption, for instance, that Delaware "savages" have killed his family in his absence?but also perhaps Brown that held at least mixed views of racial others. "Brown's Indians share some" of the traits of Rush's most disturb ing Indian "vices," most notably in Edgar Huntly"s "idleness" and thirst for blood and "carnage" (Krause 361-62). Brown from time to time goes "out of his way to accent the negative" in representing Native American traits, most pervasively in his use of the term "savage" almost ubiquitously in the novel.21 Perhaps more useful are Brown's own comments in the footnotes to his 1803 translation of Volney's Tableau du climat et du sol des ?tats-Unis d'Am?rique. Here, Brown elaborates on and argues with Volney freely, and here he reveals a rather schizophrenic set of views. Brown snaps at Vol</page><page sequence="19">Animals in Edgar Huntly {341 ney's assertion that Native Indians "must be continent and chaste." To this, Brown notes: This is ascribing to the Indian much more moderation and foresight than he displays on other occasions. Since he is not deterred, by the most palpable and powerful considerations, from the excessive indul gence of other appetites, more immediately and glaringly destructive of his safety and health than this, we cannot suppose him so very wise and provident on this head. (Volney 355) Brown pictures Natives as too appetitive, and yet, even in Edgar Huntly Brown allows some relief from any single-minded race bias, though in the form of a ready-to-hand romanticism, when on occasion Edgar describes, in surprisingly Rousseauistic terms, the "noble" warriors he has so far, un fortunately, killed: "Three beings, full of energy and heroism, endowed with minds strenuous and lofty, poured out their lives before me" (194). In his Volney translation, Brown has much more enlightened thoughts. Here he writes, for instance, that Native Americans' "condition would doubt less be improved, if they abjured every thing new and European" (385). He takes Volney to task for going to the extremes of defending "natural man" as Rousseau did, and for condemning Indians in the next breath (415).22 My purpose is not to defend Brown against charges of racism, either from a presentist position regarding that term or even on the terms of his own era.231 would argue, however, that Brown's Second World, decolo nizing text layers the experience of the indigene in with the narrative of the settler subject, Edgar; such layering amounts in itself to a critique of Edgar's historiography if not his story, for Brown's treatment of "race" allows for the hybrid Deb's story to intervene. Historically speaking, both "race" and "species" have been unstable terms continuously from the eigh teenth century (and before) until the present day, only stabilizing from time to time by political circumstance and desire?for example, for segre gation or desegregation, integration or separation. Racial markers remain highly controversial, but we can be certain that, as Dana Nelson argues, "'race' can be viewed in a literary sense as a viable, active metaphor that serves to inscribe and naturalize (as well as to subvert) power relationships ... reproduced in cultural texts as well as in human relationships" (ix); race has always been a "flexible formation" which has "respond [ed] to various urgent needs of the Anglo-American majority for centuries" (viii).</page><page sequence="20">342} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 My purpose is, however, to demonstrate that Brown's dramatization of race relations and "race" itself speaks for a decolonizing anxiety regarding the very "flexible formation(s)" that Edgar Huntly seems to hint were cul turally in play. Edgar's thoroughgoing "Indian-hating" bespeaks a colonial desire to appropriate the history?the "text" ?of the Natives, and Deb in particular; this discursive "land grabbing" is isomorphic with the English appropriation of actual land. That Deb's story is readable, albeit only in the interstices of Edgar's "official" history, bespeaks her own and possibly Brown's postcolonial desire, a desire to disrupt "the dominant language by interpolating it," as Ashcroft writes (99). By "interpolation" Ashcroft means "the wresting, from imperial hands, of some measure of political control over such things as language, writing and various kinds of cul tural discourse" in order to "resist" colonizing practices (47). Such "in terpolation of history occurs in ways that refuse to leave it intact" (99). Edgar's colonizing discourse no doubt has much to do with the still-live viability of Deb's story?his anxiety about her ownership of history meets and matches her desire for that very ownership, for he too remains snared in the matrix of colonizing and colonized Anglo-American practices. Edgar's own "ancestral" home has been denuded by Natives; his new home with his uncle falls under similar threat. For Edgar, born on American soil, "home" is what was once Indian territory. Thus his colonial desire is interlayered, palimpsestically, with an inherited sense of ownership of the same land Deb likewise "owns." Edgar, however, succeeds in a more legalistic owner ship of territory by virtue of his ownership of language: appropration of Deb's story is only one linguistic advance Edgar makes. In addition, he assumes and asserts his own "humanity," separate from the animals (in a classic taxonomic move) and from the Indians through the exercise of English. Whatever "jargon," singular or multiple, Deb might use, Edgar anglicizes as he appropriates it. Deb's postcolonial desire is manifest as a potentially explosive?as well as expressive?force in the novel's liminal placement of human and ani mal species. The eliding of distinctions between race and species, one race and another, and one species and another may be further elucidated by Gardner's argument that American identity was forged by resistance to and exclusion of racialized others under the rubrics of "savage" and "alien." Gardner persuasively reads a conflation of the concept "alien," enacted by the Irish immigrant character Clithero, and the racially Other of the novel</page><page sequence="21">Animals in Edgar Huntly {343 in the character of its Native Americans by tracing the language of "sav agery" connected with both. Federalist "anxieties about aliens were con flated with anxieties about race" (436). In Brown's canon, [r]ace, conceived as the most perilous threat to American identity, be comes at the same time a cornerstone in the myth of nation-building: it is the presence of "aliens" ?and blacks, Indians, and Europeans alike are here enveloped by this denomination ? that allows Americans to recognize common interests in each other, to recognize each other as Americans.... Without the alien, there is no American. (432) When Edgar Huntly, then, describes a panther (which he identifies as a cougar) as "the most ferocious and untamable of [his] detested race" (124), I would not make too much of his elision of race and species in what might be a simple (and common) linguistic slip, if it were not for this complex and pervasive telescoping of "kinds." That Deb's dogs are "aliens" to "man kind" also takes on more significance in light of this reading. Moreover, Gardner points out that a good deal of the policing of borders between aliens and "Americans" was accomplished culturally by the Alien and Sedi tion laws, which determined citizenship, and to some degree ethnicity and even "race," by attention to speech; these laws "allowed for the imprison ment of anyone found guilty of writing or speaking against the govern ment" (438). Edgar Huntly's attention, both by presence and by absence, to speech in connection with Old Deb turns the matrix of racial and alien otherness into a powerful performance involving animal species as well. Through the animal nature of the human characters and the potential for transforma tion among the animal "characters," a kind of material hybridity affixes to the events o? Edgar Huntly to assert a "multiplicity" against any transcen dental figuration regarding any one of the characters. Central to Ashcroft 's argument about the continued visibility and viability of colonized peoples (in spite of a general perception in postcolonial studies of their victimiza tion) is just such "transformation," which "describes the strategic process by which cultural identity is represented. By taking hold of the means of representation, colonized peoples throughout the world have transformed those processes" ?direct use of the colonizers' language or representation systems such as Deb's communication with Edgar?"into culturally appro priate vehicles" (4-5, emphasis added). Ashcroft employs, in fact, Deleuze</page><page sequence="22">EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 and Guattari's concept of the rhizome to describe the manner in which these transformations take place: "the operation of power, like the opera tion of social relations themselves, is both perpetual and discontinuous and propagates laterally and spatially like the rhizome" (50). Just as "[t]here is no faster-plan' of imperialism," which itself deploys power rhizomically, so does the "voice" of the indigene exercise more power by "producing its effects by a complex, diffracted, discontinuous layering" (50). Deb's hy bridity strengthens the discontinuity of her intervention in Edgar's story; as Ashcroft says of other postcolonial narratives, "this free-wheeling pro pensity for hybrid adaptation ... is a sign of constructive cultural evo lution" (218-19). By virtue of hybridity, both colonizer and colonized are transformed.24 I have argued here that hybridity, or the phenomenon of bordering, to some degree "liberates" at least the character of Old Deb; owing to her as sociation with her dogs, their communication, and their own mongrelized state, the strangeness and singularity of Deb's figure allows for an erup tion, albeit briefly, of an indigenous "voice."25 The possibility of cultural and species hybridity can bespeak freedom at least from the fixed cate gories of Enlightenment taxonomy, not only for the racial Other but for the racial majority as well. The collapse of boundaries between and among race and species in Edgar Huntly, with Edgar's transformative possibility along with that of Deb and others, raises very real potential for a demon strated resistance to Enlightenment taxonomy's fossilizing and racializing influences; Brown's gothicism, his return again and again to bizarre, "para normal" phenomena such as somnambulism (in Edgar Huntly) and spon taneous combustion (in Wieland), may suggest yet another counter to the demystifying tendencies of eighteenth-century science. Brown's friend and biographer William Dunlap seems to suggest as much in a kind of lament for the psychosomatic mysteries lost to science: The explosion of the electric fluid, has been heard with awe, as the voice of the Creator of the Universe; and its effect upon animal life, an effect as natural as that of fever or hunger... has been called his judgment_ As the causes of these effects become known, they ceased to be thus re garded. But a phenomenon so extraordinary, and apparently contrary to the known laws of nature as self-combustion, though easily explained to the philosopher, cannot but, even at this time, hold the mind in aw</page><page sequence="23">Animals in Edgar Huntly {345 ful pause.... Here Mr. Brown had possession of engines wherewith to work, of the most powerful and novel kind. (13-14) Brown's gothic turn can be read as approving of the disruptive within the taxonomic, the disturbing voice from the wilderness. While critics like Newman and Sivils too easily attribute the outright race hatred, on the one hand, or demonstrably respectful judgments of Edgar Huntly, on the other, to Brown himself, the fact is that Brown is not Edgar Huntly. Edgar sleepwalks through this novel in what is surely meant by Brown to demonstrate a debilitating consequence of thought less Enlightenment faith in Reason. To state the obvious, Edgar is wrong about almost everything. He reasons his way into believing Clithero has murdered Waldegrave?this, on that most unfaithful of legal contingen cies and of Enlightenment Lockean philosophy: circumstantial evidence. As Krause remarks, "What an overpowering shock to Huntly's trust in the salutary powers of Reason, and in the whole eighteenth-century structure of the moral contagion of sensibility," when, instead of "curing" Clithero Edny with information that Clithero has not actually murdered his bene factress, he in fact launches Clithero further into his insane belief that this Mrs. Lorimer must die (319). Off Clithero goes, then, to try to finish the job, leaving Edgar with jaws agape. For all of Edgar's pains, "Huntly's con cern [about murdering Indians] cannot be taken as much of a redemptive statement. It is bankrupt benevolence" (Krause 388).26 Brown's own judgments regarding Native Americans, on display in the obscuring of taxonomic boundaries in the multiplicities of Edgar Huntly, dramatically cast opposing discursive and narrative desires against one an other, adjudicating the legitimacy of neither.27 As he does in texts more overtly political, such as his feminist dialogue Alcuin, Brown executes the politics via aesthetic and historical layering of views to the degree that a "voice" of the author is difficult to identify. As did the "scientific" culture of taxonomy and its related disciplines of medicine, somatic and psycho logical alike, Brown, like Linnaeus, and like Rush, entertained the possi bility of bordering phenomena as disruptive of Enlightenment categories, as taxonomy in Edgar Huntly seems to work in two distinct ways: it both re inforces species and race distinction and asserts hybridity, or multiplicity, against those distinctions.28 It is important that these phenomena them selves, however, operate antisymbolically (to invoke Deleuze and Guattari</page><page sequence="24">346} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE*. VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 again) in drawing attention to the material construction of the racialized body itself and its pull against the critical desire to affix symbolic and tran scendent meaning. It might be prudent, then, to end by invoking Russ Cas tronovo's cautionary discussion of Border Theory; he writes that U.S. bor der literatures and Border Theory itself have the capacity simultaneously to explode historical dialectics by assertion of the kind of hybridity I have invoked as antisymbolic and to reinscribe those same historical allegiances and geographies: Critical accounts often narrativize the conflicts emerging along and between cultural boundaries by representing border writing as a dis cursive strategy capable of deconstructing ossified structures like patri archy or the nation. ... [A] different strain in this narrative ... ex amines the interstices between border and nation to suggest that the border involves more than tactics that undermine the inviolate sover eignty of the nation, for negotiations along the border also have the unintended counterpurpose of solidifying and extending racial and na tional boundaries. (196) Rather than suggesting that Brown has "liberated" the voice of Native Americans in the frontier drama o? Edgar Huntly by allowing a seepage of Deb's story to appear around the edges of Edgar's colonizing history, I would heed Castronovo's warning that even the border-phenomena among racial and species taxonomies can, and indeed did, "solidify" into U.S. practices and policies regarding ethnic cleansing, both in Indian "removal" and in tightening restrictions of legal rights of slaves, in the century just following Edgar Huntly''s cultural dialogue on the matter. In the case of Old Deb, however, cultural mongrel herself, accompanied by her mongrel dogs, Brown deploys a view of race and species not yet solidified along the geographical and textual borders that would soon enable full-scale geno cide, when Edgar Huntly's walking dream turned into an imperial night mare. NOTES i. Eve Kornfeld, for example, makes little distinction between author and charac ter in commenting that Brown "represents the Indian as the 'fierce, dark, and jealous' Other" (292). She further suggests that the "Indian as savage Other be</page><page sequence="25">Animals in Edgar Huntly { 347 comes an essential(ist) anchor for Brown's novelistic, and perhaps his personal, psychological explorations in the 1790s" (293). 2. Brown's novel Wieland makes this concern even more central, as witnessed by its subtitle: "The Transformation." 3. Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer outline the contested ground of empiricism between Boyle and Hobbes and their proponents; their argument serves as a re minder that the very premises of eighteenth-century taxonomy were cultural negotiations more than evidence of the transcendental foundations of "Reason" commonly associated with these early modern projects. See Leviathan and the Air Pump. 4. Linnaeus exercised a consistent zeal throughout his career for clarification of boundaries among species: miracles did not occur in nature, he lectured fre quently, and transformation from one species to another was impossible, or so this line of reasoning went. He was a long time coming to the possibility of hy bridization. However, he made exceptions, and it is this strain of his thought that demonstrates the powerful hold of less taxonomically "pure" classifications more broadly in the eighteenth century. For example, he taught his students that "[i]f you rubbed the back of a puppy with aquavit... the animal would become a dwarf" (Lindroth 39). 5. Rpt. in Alfred Weber, ed. Charles Brockden Brown: Literary Essays and Reviews. Brown uses Linneaus and Buffon as examples of the more brilliant of scientists? those who are at heart "romancers" ? along with Isaac Newton: "The same man is frequently both historian and romancer. Buffon, Linneus (sic), and Herschel, are examples of this union. Their observations are as diligent as their theories are adventurous" (83-84). These theorists of nature, Brown would have it, reside at the border between history and romance to the degree that they are a "breed" altogether their own. Fritz Fleischmann writes of this argument, "Both [history and romance] are narratives, members of a protean family of global reach" (139), though, finally, "Brown's summary establishes romance as the nearly all-inclusive mode of relating human events" (140). 6. On the subject of Darwin's cultural influence, see Fredrika J. Teute, who out lines many linkages in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries between "scientific knowledge" and "institutional critique and sexual freedom" and, re latedly, "[a]ttempts to propound a new order of personal relations founded on innate, universal characteristics" which "paralleled the scientific quest to classify the natural world" (320). Her summary assessment that "[o]rdering nature natu ralized order, establishing categories that erected hierarchies and systematized difference" (322) supports my own conclusions about the crossovers between and among species and "races." Teute also includes a thoroughgoing descrip tion of the New York Friendly Club, its extended circle of discussants among men and women, and its various ongoing concerns, including E. H. Smith's involvement with the Manumission Society. David Shields also helpfully elu cidates the fluid world of eighteenth-century clubs and groups, and their role</page><page sequence="26">348} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 in disseminating ideas like those of Darwin. "[T]avern companies, coffeehouse fellowships, tea-table gatherings, salons, dancing assemblies, routs, card parties, gentlemen's clubs, and college fraternities" contributed to "private society" in British America as "discursive institutions," among which the Friendly Club par ticipated (xiv). 7. Smith notes the pig in his Diary in an entry on 9 September 1797 (Diary 357). Interestingly, Smith's twentieth-century editor, James Cronin, finds it necessary to marvel over Smith's interest in animals and hybrid animals. In a footnote to the entry for 4 June 1796, in which Smith remarks on visiting an elephant ex hibit, Cronin writes: "At fairly regular intervals, traveling animals shows (often with one animal), came to New York. Smith seems never to have missed one. The intense interest and hunger of this man for information of the kind that is often today commonplace for children is sometimes startling" (Diary 173). Cronin seems to have forgotten that as a medical doctor, Smith maintained an interest in animals and hybrids that stood to instruct him in anatomy and medi cine. 8. Sky-Walk was published in the April 1798 issue of James Watters's Weekly Maga zine. Smith read the manuscript in April of 1798, and responded enthusiastically: "Every sentence increases my admiration of this performance. Why are there any obstacles to its immediate publication? Why so little liberal curiosity in our country?" (Diary 438). 9. Norman Grabo notes this multiplying feature of the panther(s) as part of his argument about doubling, coincidence, and the surreal effects of both in his Co incidental Art of Charles Brockden Brown, though his argument serves the point that the "logic" of these unaccountable plot issues is psychological and symbolic rather than naturalistic. 10. Leslie Fiedler, Norman Grabo, Bill Christophersen, and Stephen Watts mention animals in association with what Watts calls a "crude anthropology of juxtaposed 'Civilization' and 'Savagery'" (119); for each, discussion of the novel's animals quickly transitions into discussion of "Indians" under the rubric of "savagery," and in each, animals are merely symbolic of Edgar's mental state. 11. Using the same textual phenomena, my argument differs from these in that it I do not read the animals as necessarily symbolic. Edgar "becomes" animal, and later he recuperates some but perhaps not all of his "humanity." Fiedler and Berthold view animals, the panther in particular, as existing solely to reflect upon Edgar; I view the animals as characters operating upon the plot in an agency comparable to that of the human characters. 12. On the Freudean front, the Sarsefield character, surrogate father to both Edgar and Clithero, has survived 20 long years by his ability to adapt to situations as re quired. As Mackenthum recalls, Sarsefield participates in and benefits from "any kind of human society, changing his identity like a weather cock its direction. Unlike Huntly, who emerges from his cave like primordial man, slaying every In dian that crosses his path, Sarsefield chooses to assimilate to the Italian 'savages,'</page><page sequence="27">Animals in Edgar Huntly {349 just as he had earlier religiously assimilated to Hinduism and Islam as necessity required" (22). 13. Gayatri Spivak's famous question, "Can the subaltern speak?" comments on this issue from a perspective of Third World analysis; her answers?yes and no ? speak to voice and voicelessness in Edgar Huntly, though her analysis proceeds from a particularly binary premise of Third World postcolonial analysis in which the subaltern is more directly colonized by European discourse than are the in digenous Natives of the U.S., whose colonization interacts multiply with both "native" settlers and their colonizers, England. 14. Whether even "Deb" is her given name is a matter of some critical debate. Sivils argues that we are never told her real name, since Deb is obviously not a Native American name (298); Grabo, however, makes the case that Deb, as a "Christian ized Indian," may have been given this name at birth ("Introduction" xiii). 15. Edgar is in fact somewhat professional in his compulsion to edit; he believes that a responsible transmission of text includes attention to the opinions that text might influence, as evidenced by his editing the atheistic passages out of his friend Waldegrave's letters for his fianc?e Mary's consumption. 16. Edward Watts points out, in similar fashion, that Brown's Arthur Mervyn prac tices some of the same colonizing gestures in his storytelling mechanisms in Arthur Mervyn. See 113. 17. Leslie Fiedler was one of the first to assign central importance to the Natives' silence in Edgar Huntly (148-49). 18. "Man was the end of all God's works," declared Jeremiah Burroughes in 1657; "He made others for man, and man for himself." "All things," agreed Richard Bentley in 1692, were created "principally for the benefit and pleasure of man." "Man, if we look to final causes, may be regarded as the centre of the world," mused Francis Bacon, "insomuch that if man were taken away from the world, the rest would seem to be all astray, without aim or purpose" (qtd. in Thomas 18). 19. In France, Buffon, himself author of a rival taxonomic system, could not abide any such suggestion, and insisted on maintaining a firm line between humans and all other species. The grounds for such distinctions were varied: some argued for pure physical difference as constituting the uncrossable boundary between species; others maintained that language would ever be a barrier; many, like Buf fon, took the riskier?because least empirical?stance that only humans have souls. To question humanity's absolute dominion over nonhuman species was, to quote Robert Boyle, "a discouraging impediment to the empire of man over the inferior creatures' " (qtd. in Thomas 22); to establish what John Beale, Boyle's correspondent, termed "the empire of mankind," the Royal Society supported the study of nonhuman species to determine " whether they may be of any ad vantage to mankind, as food or physic; and whether those or any other uses of them can be further improved'" (qtd. in Thomas 27). Beyond the traditional Judeo-Christian reasons for maintaining the superiority of humans, the scientific community was interested in producing human-centered results of scientific in</page><page sequence="28">350} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 39, NUMBER 2 quiry. To entertain the possibility of shared human-animal characteristics might raise questions about the ethics of such results-oriented study. 20. This conflation of Indian and animal was not unique to Rush. In A Mixed Race, Frank Shuffelton notes that in Jonathan Dickinson's 1696 narrative of captivity, Dickinson "finds much of the communicative behavior of his Jobese captors in explicable because of the hermeneutic circle he inscribes: the Indians are animal like; therefore their actions and language are irrational; therefore they are animal like" (48). 21. In reference to Brown's translation of Volney, Krause writes: "On the one hand, he chastized Volney for insisting on the technicality that North American Indi ans should properly be called savages to distinguish them from East Indians, yet in Edgar Huntly Brown almost never calls his Indians anything other than sav ages, which, according to the definition he belabored with Volney, means he is picking a term reserved for those 'we want to stigmatize as wicked and cruel, and [which] is given to men in the rudest state of society, only when we allude to their ignorance or ferocity'" (qtd. in Krause 367-68). 22. Arguing with Volney in a footnote, Brown defends the perceived revenge-tactics of Natives: "Retaliation is the mode of punishment which all simple nations, and some refined ones, have solemnly adapted, as the most just. The same structure of mind, which gave this rule to one nation, or one man, gives it to another" (Volney 381). It is worth noting also that the August 1798 issue of the Weekly Magazine, an issue including a continuation of Brown's serialized Ar thurMervyn, printed an anonymous letter on the subject of "Indian Civilization." The au thor of this letter evinces a reasonable and respectful, albeit patronizing, position toward Native Americans, arguing that the project of "civilizing" Natives will be fulfilled only with sufficient knowledge of them. Reprinting in the letter both the minutes of meetings of the Society of Friends discussing their commitments to assistance for Natives and a few letters from representatives from the Seneca and Oneida nations, this author hopes to demonstrate that "the Indians, even in their present degraded situation, profess souls of a refined texture and sus ceptible of the keenest sensibilities" (4) to argue that "sympathy" is called for in Euro-American dealings with Natives. Brown is probably not the author of this letter; it argues too thoroughly from the position of Christian fellowship and goodwill to have been Brown's. However, Brown's awareness of sympathetic views towards Natives?in addition to his awareness of the racism of influential people like Rush?is important in establishing his own complex position. 23. Sivils both praises and condemns Brown from an entirely presentist definition of "sovereignty" in his "Native American Sovereignty," a position that tells us little about Brown's own culture and his own working definitions of race or sov ereignty (301). 24. Shuffelton writes, "The English immigrants to New England were not merely trying to impose their culture violently or otherwise on the Native Americans;</page><page sequence="29">Animals in Edgar Huntly {351 they were being ethnically transformed themselves in the process of confronting and being confronted by the people they found already on the ground" (8). 25. Relatedly, in an early statement about hybridity in Third World narratives, Homi Bhabha carefully maintains that the liberating "Third Space" between histori cally fixed identities "constitutes the discursive conditions of enunciation that ensure that the meaning and symbols of culture have no primordial unity or fixity" ("Cultural Diversity" 208). More recently, Bhabha has made the case that such an in-between position is temporal as well as spatial: "The poetics of iden tification strives to represent the process through which intercultural relations in-between class, gender, generation, race, religion, or region are articulated as hybrid identifications" ("On Cultural Choice" 190). The "emergence of a spectral or virtual 'third' position that mediates the relation of self to other" (192) "lays no claim to an originary self-presence" (190). 26. Mackenthum argues that "Edgar Huntly is not a reliable narrator and... Brown may not have expected the reader to view the events from his perspective alone" (22). 27. David Kazanjian makes a similar case regarding Brown's inscription of Native American history into the colonizing space of the fragment "Memoirs of Car win," though his emphasis is on the "nationalist and foundationalist terms of [Brown's] own reception" (461). 28. Christopher Looby has argued in "The Constitution of Nature" that the prac tice of taxonomy was inherently imperialistic in the eighteenth century owing to overgeneralizing and abstracting of species beyond nature's "chaos" as part and parcel of American expansionism. In The Poetics of Natural History, Christophe Irmscher persuasively contravenes this reading with his readings of collectors and naturalists as idiosyncratic. WORKS CITED Anonymous.
