<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REVIEWS feel that a functional point of view is desirable, if religion is to control all phases of life, but they do not discuss or illustrate how this is to be achieved. Dr. Arlo Brown and others express the fear that, unless "we think through a way of treating religious subjects adequately on an in- terfaith basis in the public school curriculum, the propagandists of atheism and materialism will win the day." But no one among the forty- six writers seems to dare to suggest the radical changes that are needed in basic philosophy and methods. Fears of secularism, atheism, and ma- terialism imply that the Christian religion has not been equal to the challenges of a modern world, that none of the theological gods in its pantheon have been able to control the develop- ing processes. Perhaps the orthodox concepts rest too much on rationalizations of prescientific ideas and fail to appreciate the growing under- standings of the spiritual forces at work in all areas of life. Instead of trying to make man fit into theological arguments about God, let re- ligionists use the growing knowledge of how personality develops and how social forces operate; and let appreciations of the "divine" and use of the symbol "God" be with reference to a universe and a life-process that transcends anthropomorphic images. ERNEST J. CHAVE Federated Theological Faculty University of Chicago The Individual and His Religion: A Psychologi- cal Interpretation. By GORDON W. ALLPORT. New York: Macmillan, I950. xi+I47 pages. $2.50. In examining religion in general from the point of view of psychology in general, there has been no book comparable to this since William James. There have been other excellent and original books on aspects of the theme, such as those of Boisen. But we have long needed a vol- ume with the same scope and broad insight as that of James, which yet took adequately into account all the facets of the great developments which have occurred in psychology since his time. No doubt the author would claim only that he has tried to make a small beginning in this direction. It is true that his work is brief and is suggestive rather than exhaustive. But it is so penetrating that it may well stimulate the more detailed work still needed. Modern psychology, to get ahead, had to turn its back upon the altars of religion and for- sake the philosopher's armchair. In accumulat- ing verifiable facts, however, it became "psy- chology without a soul." The author believes "there is inherent absurdity in supposing that psychology and religion, both dealing with the outward reaching of man's mind, must be per- manently and hopelessly at odds." But if a har- mony of effort is to arise, it cannot be through a "narrowly conceived science" or a "narrowly conceived religion." There is, concludes the author, no single form of the "religious sentiment." "It is the habitual and intentional focusing of experience rather than the character of the experience itself that marks the existence of a religious sentiment." Here, as elsewhere, the recent discoveries about the "unconscious" are recognized and included, but the psychological position as a whole is an ego-psychology in the same sense as that of James. There is also much affinity to White- head, for example: "Perhaps the most striking fact about subjective religion is the contrast be- tween its essential simplicity when, well- formed, it is playing its part in the economy of the personal life, and its extreme complexity in the process of forming." With his characteristic skill in definition, Dr. Allport sees the "mature religious sentiment" as "a disposition, built up through experience, to respond favorably, and in certain habitual ways, to conceptual objects and principles that the in- dividual regards as of ultimate importance in his own life, and as having to do with what he regards as permanent or central in the nature of things." Religion to the individual is "his ulti- mate attempt to enlarge and to complete his own personality by finding the supreme context in which he rightly belongs." A large contribution of the book is its rejec- tion of reductionism and geneticism. "The plain truth is that origins can tell nothing about the validity of a belief." A mature religious senti- ment need feel no inferiority in the face of sci- ence. "Instead of serving as the stale ground from which scientific insights dazzlingly emerge, religion may be perceived as the fresh and sparkling insight needed to supplement and cor- rect the lifeless and de-valued ground of sci- ence." There is an opening chapter on the origins of the religious quest and a useful chapter on the religion of childhood and youth featuring analy- sis of a firsthand study. The religion of maturity, leading to an understanding of the "mature re- 293</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ligious sentiment," is then discussed. The latter three chapters are on conscience, doubt, and faith. On conscience, the author agrees with Erich Fromm's position but for denying that a mature ethics must be antitheistic. In discussing the nature of faith, the author polishes up Brentano's concept of "intention" and brings it up to date to serve as the keystone of our descriptive understanding of faith. "In- tention is the striving of an individual for a goal that is more or less clearly envisaged and con- gruent with a sentiment." There is a "forward thrust" emanating from mature sentiments, dynamic in character; hence faith can be under- stood in terms of the religious intention. "All re- ligious acts try in some way to close the gap that exists between the actual state of one's values and the possibility of their fuller realization." In spite of its brevity, this book is destined to stand high in the literature relating psychology and religion. It also offers new promise that, without threat to the values of either discipline, religionists may once again become also psy- chologists and psychologists become religionists. SEWARD HILTNER Federated Theological Faculty University of Chicago Drawing-room Conversion: A Sociological Ac- count of the Oxford Group Movement. By ALLAN W. EISTER. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, I950. 236 pages. $3.50. The Oxford Group Movement, perhaps more widely known as Buchmanism, or more recently as Moral Rearmament, has been written about often enough during the last two decades and from widely differing points of view. It has been praised, and it has been condemned, but here is the first full-length book study of it from a de- tached scholarly viewpoint. The author is a member of the department of sociology at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, and has employed well-recognized sociological techniques in the investigation and analysis of the movement. Professor Howard E. Jensen, in the Introduction, says: "It is to the accumula- tion of such verifiable data as is disclosed by monographs of this nature in the sociology, psychology and history of religions that we must ultimately look for a more adequate evalu- ation of its (religion's) significance and role in the total experience and social existence of man." Students of religion will agree heartily with him and rejoice at the appearance of this book, for they are themselves convinced that religion has not been accorded the attention it merits as a factor in our culture. A recent con- ference set up by the Committee on American Civilization of the American Council of Learned Societies, devoted to the discussion of religion in American civilization, gave not a little of its at- tention to this failure on the part of scholars to take religion seriously into account as they study American culture. The author writes out of extensive reading of the literature of and about the movement; has made careful firsthand observation of the group in action and effected personal contact with numerous individual members of the group, the obscure as well as the more prominent in its leadership. He tells briefly the story of its found- ing and development; sets forth its principal aims and methods; and attempts an analysis of the basic motivations that lead people into it. After a very good discussion of the "sect" and the "cult," following closely the distinction sug- gested by Howard Becker, he finds that the group fits exactly into neither class but has some of the characteristics of both. Neverthe- less, the rather loose organization of the group puts it definitely in the cult group, rather than the sect, which he characterizes chiefly as "a closed group with rigid qualifying tests for mem- bership." The distinct impression is given that the movement is in a state of decline. This may be true, but no serious evidence in the book sup- ports the conclusion, and it is extremely doubt- ful if those involved in the movement would agree that it is true. There are many significant religious move- ments in America worthy of like sociological and psychological study. It is to be hoped that schol- ars in these fields will give them attention. Here is an excellent field for doctoral studies which might prove of value to the public. CHARLES S. BRADEN Northwestern University The Reunion of the Church: A Defense of the South India Scheme.
