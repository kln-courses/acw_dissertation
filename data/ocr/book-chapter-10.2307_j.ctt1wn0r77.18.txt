<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 5. Psycho-Reflexology We sometimes cry when we catch sight of an object, not because this object  generates a sad feeling in and of itself, but because it reminds us of a dead friend  through an association. – Vladimir Bekhterev, 1913 Feelings and Emotions In October 1927 at Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio a symposium was  held under the title “Feelings and Emotions.” The occasion was the inaugura- tion of a new psychological laboratory, which, as a brand new institution,  was being housed together in one building with the chemists. The lists of  those lecturing was impressive. In the volume that was published shortly  thereafter of the lectures, all the great men – and Margaret Washburn as  the only woman – of experimental psychology were represented, including  Pierre Janet from Paris, Alfred Adler from Vienna, Edouard Claparède from  Geneva, the Hamburg institutional director William Stern, the physiologist  Walter Bradford Cannon from the Harvard University Medical School, and  from Leningrad the old reflexologist Vladimir Makhailovich Bekhterev.1 On  the program were 34 lectures by scientists who belonged to the avant-garde  of psychology and who represented the second generation of the classic  school: Karl Bühler as a student of Ebbinghaus, David Katz as a student  of Georg Elias Müller, Adler as the fallen student of Freud. The whole was  under the auspices of James McKeen Cattell, Wilhelm Wundt’s very f irst  assistant in Leipzig.2 Barely 50 years after setting up Wundt’s f irst psychological laboratory,  a time when psychology schools and methods differentiated themselves,  specialized, and fought with and against Wundt, the enemy factions recon- ciled in late autumn in Ohio. But what seems to be ripe for f ilming in this  scenery, the strolls through the autumn foliage, an international exchange  between scientists, the reconciliation of the different schools, is science  f iction. First of all there are contradictory reports of who exactly was in  Ohio. William Stern merely sent an article from Hamburg, and all that is  known about Pierre Janet is that he had spoken in Princeton, Philadelphia,  and at Columbia University a year earlier as he was on his way back from a  series of guest lectures in Mexico about the “Psicología de los sentimientos.”  Bekhterev, whose visit Ellenberger seeks to authenticate,3 was in the process  </page> <page sequence="2"> 220 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  of being politically sidelined at the time, and in 1927 in the Soviet Union  this meant much more than a travel ban. What is certain is that the Wittenberg Symposium in 1927 was one of the  last great international psychological congresses before the Second World  War. It is also clear that the topic “Feelings and Emotions” was so explosive  that the National Research Council in Washington supported the sympo- sium. The invitations and the interest of the speakers show that the problem  of feelings and sensations was the focus of neurological and psychological  research all over the world. What we can see from the contributions is that  the theories of how to explain, measure, control, and regulate emotions  were still quite diffuse. It is clear that there were certain convergences in  the discussions in Ohio. It is also clear that one person was def initively not  invited: the inconvenient Sigmund Freud. “Feelings and emotions” were no  longer available to simple therapeutic or cultural critical work. At the time,  Freud was writing Civilization and its Discontents, expressing doubt that  a strictly physiological description could do justice to the historical and  cultural networks in which emotions are differentiated. For this reason he  advises starting from associations, images, and representations in order to  infer from this the hidden, underground world of feelings. It is not easy to deal scientif ically with feelings. One can attempt to  describe their physiological signs. Where this is not possible – and I am  afraid that the oceanic feeling too will defy this kind of characteriza- tion – nothing remains but to fall back on the ideational content which  is most readily associated with the feeling.4 In Ohio it was exactly the ideational content that was suppressed. Shortly  before the lights had gone out in Europe – to borrow a documentary f ilm  title from Alexander Hammid – before the various fascist systems could  practically demonstrate that they could stabilize their power in a targeted  manner through mass mobilization of certain feelings, the scientists were  attempting to f ind their way in the darkness of “feelings and emotions.”  They wanted to get from describing and systematizing feelings and sen- sations in the laboratory to inducing and regulating these feelings. The  symposium at Wittenberg College represented an international brainstorm,  in which psychology gathered together its practical clout in order to be  able to promise that they could direct emotionalized bodies in the future,  physiologically, pedagogically, and even aesthetically. The alliance with  chemistry expressed in the new architecture of Wittenberg College would  in fact determine the immediate future of psychology and psychiatry.  </page> <page sequence="3"> PsyCho-reFlexology 221 In 1927, however, there were still quite different concepts of artif icial  emotionalization. It is possible that Bekhterev was not in Ohio in October, 1927, but his  lecture was definitely given. In it he presented a proposal for a linked system  in which nerves and apparatuses, metabolism and chemistry would be  amalgamated beyond the individual body. Feelings are the measurable signs  of this interconnection. Bekhterev’s proposal, which he had worked out in  parallel to the f irst effective mass use of the press in the second half of the  nineteenth century and the signif icant use of the press and f ilm in the First  World War, marked the aesthetic concepts of many avant-garde artists in  Russia, then in the Soviet Union, during the tens and twenties. Meyerhold’s  theater of biomechanics, in which bodily expression simulated and induced  mental activities as the primacy of the “external”, Eisenstein’s montage of  attractions, Kuleshov’s coordinate system of feelings for f ilm, or Vertov’s  kinoki concept are directly or indirectly based on Bekhterev’s research and  are inconceivable without his medial turn in reflexology. With his lecture  in Ohio Bekhterev was attempting to establish transatlantic contact. He  directed his message at those to whom it would concern, due to their own  research: the physicians surrounding Walter B. Cannon from Harvard, this  “shadow community” who had also begun to examine not only individual  organs, but connections and relations between physiological circumstances  and homeostasis within complex physiological systems.5 Emotions, which  had always been considered an infraction into the controlled experiment in  laboratory medicine, were now to be seen as signs and signals of an affective  interaction, as information about the states of the body! Bekhterev wanted  to place his biomedial vision in the context of this research. It came, like  Münsterberg’s proposal ten years earlier, too early for science and too late  for the author. The Ends of Paranoia Whoever experiments must also take into consideration that his hypothesis  might get conf irmed. Vladimir Mikhailovich’s death becomes a legend,  like in a Kleistian biography, at the moment that his life comes to its heroic  highpoint, and at the same time it falls into the grotesque. In December  1927, when the great old man of Russian hypnosis and reflexology, who was  now over seventy, was being celebrated in Moscow at the First All-Union  Congress of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists, he unexpectedly got a  summons from Stalin to pay him a medical visit. Bekhterev diagnosed him:  </page> <page sequence="4"> 222 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  paranoia. Following this Stalin had him poisoned on the very same night  with two specially prepared ice cream desserts.6 Daniil Kharms made the  story famous in Soviet literature: So the professor’s wife was sitting drinking coffee. Suddenly a ring. What’s  that? – A parcel for you. The professor’s wife was really pleased; smiling all over her face, she  thrust a tip into the postman’s hand and was soon unwrapping the parcel. She looked in the parcel and saw an urn of ashes, with a message: ‘Here- with all that remains of you spouse.’7 Bekhterev, who added a “von” to his last name in German, was a celebrity  in international psychiatry8 until he was murdered, and the memory of  his name for the western world became reduced to a disease of the bone  marrow, which results in a stiffening of the spine. In the east his name  remained current because one of the most experimental clinics for nerv- ous diseases is named after him, which is familiarly referred to as “the  Bekhterev” to this day.9 Alongside Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov, his teacher,  and Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, his lifelong rival, Bekhterev is considered the  founder of Russian ref lexology. The comparison with Pavlov’s working  method, strictly concentrated on the physiology of the nerves, does not quite  do justice to the grandiose vision of a unity of all sciences of the human  being and its multiple relationships that Bekhterev wanted to realize in  his Psychoneurological Institute. Because Bekhterev’s experiments and  proposals are almost completely unknown, at least in West Germany, but  nonetheless represent the missing link in a neurological media history,  because they so decidedly influenced the arts and artists in the Soviet Union  and then also in the western world, and because they unexpectedly link the  experiments of the tens and twenties to the later cybernetic experiments of  the sixties, I will present them here, at least to the degree that they affect  an archaeology of the cinema. Bekhterev had studied neurophysiology in Paris with Charcot, experi- mental psychology with Wundt in Leipzig, brain anatomy with Paul Emil  Flechsig, and, like Sechenov and Pavlov, had worked in the psychological  laboratory of Carl Ludwig before becoming professor of psychiatry in  Kazan in 1885.10 The condition that he took on for his appointment at Kazan  was to set up a psycho-physiological laboratory in the classical Leipzig  style: with a pneumograph, a reflexograph, a reflexometer, an apparatus  for measuring brain volume, and a Hipp’s chronograph for measuring  psychic processes. This equipment was standard in the laboratories that  </page> <page sequence="5"> PsyCho-reFlexology 223 were founded all over the world by Wundt students toward the end of the  nineteenth century.11 In 1884, when Bekhterev was Flechsig’s associate at the University Nerve  Clinic, the lawyer Dr. Daniel Paul Schreber had just been admitted, whose  Memoirs of My Nervous Illness appeared in German in 1906, which formed  the basis for Freud’s Psychoanalytic Comments on an Autobiographical Ac- count of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia paranoids).12 Schreber’s memoirs as  “Iatrogenic (i.e., professional) psychosis”13 made it possible to see the mirror  inversion, the feedback between the systematic delusions of psychiatrists  and patients, and Bekhterev’s later misjudgment of this is thought to have  laid the groundwork for his abrupt end. Schreber’s memoirs, as a view to  the dark side, or better yet, the inner side of brain anatomy, would serve to  set the protocol for what was researched in Leipzig under Flechsig. God to start with is only nerve, not body, and akin therefore to the hu- man soul. But unlike the human body, where nerves are present only in  limited numbers, the nerves of God [...] have in particular the faculty  of transforming themselves into all things of the created world; in this  capacity they are called rays.14 Bekhterev’s system of neuroscience forms an odd counterpart to Schreber’s  madness, it is also based on assuming a ubiquity conveyed by nerves, in the  space and intoxication of which trans-personal forms of communication  and transmission occur. Schreber’s and Bekhterev’s constructions are both the flip side of the  new psychological and neurological sciences, which had taken it upon  themselves in the second half of the nineteenth century to experimen- tally fragment the human body. Anyone combining what they analyzed  in interdisciplinary paranoia could recognize the vision of a technically  guided, emotionalized, and rhythmically moved human-machine corpus.  Among the scientif ic parallel worlds that dissected these bodies in a  sensory and motor sense and – as can be seen then in 1895 – made them  cinematomorphic, is the brain research that Bekhterev did with Flechsig  in Leipzig in 1884 as well as Wundt’s experimental examination of the  processes of attention and memory and of “sensations, (of the question of  ‘psychophysics’ strictly speaking)”, which was the majority of his work in  the laboratory.15 At the same time, Londe was ref ining chronophotography  in Paris in order to systematize neurology according to the traces found on  the body’s surface, and in the Bois de Boulogne Demeny was putting on a  suit with metal strips on the side in order to record movement as ergonomic  </page> <page sequence="6"> 224 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  data. The transformation of the body in the signal system was in full gear  everywhere, which would lend itself well to broadcast news technology. Ever since there have been methods of brain anatomy “to take apart the  organ with its billions of ganglion cells and nerve conductors, mechanical  observations of mental appearances have been recognized by science.”16  They are supposed to serve to direct the tributaries in their ever more  mobile existence and also to guide them morally. Brain specialists hoped “to  provide a physiological foundation for ethics [...] in order to be able to base  law on this whenever possible”, as Flechsig suggested in his rector’s speech  in 1894.17 At the end of the nineteenth century neurology was asserting itself  directly as a science of power. Bekhterev, who had studied at all of the centers of this European  neuropower, began to link hysteria, hypnosis, and suggestibility research  on the one hand with nerve-physiology and brain-anatomy on the other.  He examined unconscious mental activity with laboratory apparatuses,  with which he undertook to check and regulate crazy thoughts. And like  Bleuler, Bateson, Deren, or Rouch, he examined hypnosis and suggestibility  as historical and social phenomena. One of the Bekhterev’s f irst great cases was that of the sect founder  Kondrat Malyovany, whom he had described in the study Suggestion and  its Role in Social Life. In this encyclopedic examination of historical mass  illusions, mass hallucinations, and mass possessions, in which Bekhterev  investigated the psychopathological background of religious and political  group dynamics, Malyovanism stands in a long series of psychopathologies  between medieval demon possession and modern mass panic. Bekhterev  did not settle for any psychiatric judgment “of primary madness or of para- noia”,18 but reconstructions, in “numerous examinations” with Malyovany,  the system of mad perception, although he was less interested in a clear  diagnosis than in the way to stimulate and convey Malyovany’s thoughts,  with which he wanted to account for the relations between consciousness,  nerves, and their collective interconnection. Not only in his perception, but also in Malyovany’s movements, in his “de- cisive gestures”, his “restless speech”, the “trembling” of his hands, Bekhterev  discovered affective feedback that extended beyond the person of the sect  leader. His attacks “of trembling or shaking” while preaching led to “some  of those present, namely the women, also coming down with convulsions  or cramps.”19 Bekhterev judged the different expressions of Malyovanian  possession according to Charcot’s system of hysteria.20 Unlike at Salpêtrière,  however, and similar to how Deren will describe Haitian possession in  contrast to clinical hysteria, Bekhterev diagnoses the states not as a sign  </page> <page sequence="7"> PsyCho-reFlexology 225 of individual psychopathology, but describes them as symptoms of social  states and social networks. Like Bleuler, Bateson, Deren, or Rouch, Bekhterev was also a commuter  between two worlds: the world of the European natural sciences and the East  Eureopean world with its multi-spiritualist cultures and states of conscious- ness, which he was also familiar with from his medical practice. Although he  had studied trance techniques, hypnosis, and the lessons of systematizing  them at Salpêtrière, in Russia Bekhterev drew a theoretical cordon sanitaire  around his research on hypnosis by precisely demarcating it against the  traditional shamanistic cures that are so similar to hypnosis. As an inorodčy,  a non-Russian in the intelligentsia, he had good reason not to dare to go near  the fringes of science. Possession and shamanism, which were epidemic in  the Russian past and present as Bekhterev described them in 1905, were  supposed to be cured by the systematic medical form of suggestion.21 Only  by institutionally differentiating suggestion from clinically induced hypnosis  and the practices of shamanism could there be a clean division between  spirits and spirit, between madness and science, between what was examined  as “mental over-inoculation” in archaic mass hysteria and the technological  news systems, which would soon be called media and mass media. Hypnosis as a therapeutic technique belongs to the clinical focal points  of Bekhterev’s work. His therapy program for alcoholics, whom he treated  with hypnosis, were internationally recognized innovations.22 Since 1893  he had been teaching hypnotic procedures at the Psychoneurological  Institute. Like Charcot’s lessons, Bekhterev’s hypnosis lectures were not  only attended by students and doctors, but also by the local public in St.  Petersburg. At this time Bekhterev developed the foundations of a new and  universal theory of the human mind. At least by 1902, due to the results of  his research on “conductors in the brain and the marrow”, Bekhterev was  opposing the various psycho-physiological theories with his new concept  of a “biopsychology”, which outlines the most important strategy of his  research and therapies. The error of all [...] teachers consists in the attempt to fathom the es- sence of things speculatively, while the task of true science does not lie in  investigating the essence of things itself, but is geared toward pursuing  the mutual relationships between appearances.23 Making relations, rather than essence, the object of science was the episte- mological turn from which Bekhterev formed the basis of an avant-garde  science of the human being. </page> <page sequence="8"> 226 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  Everything visionary, however, f irst had to hold up to psychological  experimentation. Bekhterev solved the problem of mental relations in  the light of cellular physiology and impulse transmission by assuming a  universal energy that represents a medium of general inf luence in and  between all things and living beings: ... that the world surrounding us therefore presents itself to a certain  degree as active medium f illed with energy, that furthermore the me- dium, in whatever form we might want to conceive of it, can be modif ied  under the influence of the active principles of energy, and that in this way  the entire visible exterior world owes its emergence to the effectivity of  energy within a medium, which is as unfamiliar to us in its essence as  energy is itself.24 Bekhterev could infer this energy based on experiments in artif icial growth,  in which dissimilar substances entered into mutual effect. Furthermore, he  had discovered “action streams” in the peripheral and central nerves, which  also pointed to a general energy. Incidentally, due to the same experiments  Bekhterev held the view that evolution was not driven by selection, but by  the polymorphous creative powers in organisms to form something new  and to learn.25 Only eighty years later will neurobiologists again introduce  an epistemological turn with similar theses.26 Bekhterev examined the circumstances and functions of transmission  of this world energy, the carrier and director of which would be the central  nervous system in higher organisms. In contrast, for example, to Dubois- Reymond, who attempted to prove that the f low of nerves was “animal  electricity”, Bekhterev describes energy as a principle, which equally encom- passes material, electro-chemical changes and the “subjective states that  are commonly designated as mental appearances or inner appearances.”27 Here, however, it must be emphasized that in our use of the term ‘energy’  we are in no way associating this with the common usage of ‘physical  energy,’ as is currently assumed. In our view, the energy or force for the be- ing is nothing other than an active principle disseminated in the nature of  the universe. We know nothing more of the essence of this active principle,  which appears as the milieu of the global aether, but we see the expressions  themselves in the constant conversion of substance all around us.28 This theory of a universal transformability of the world was Bekhterev’s  answer to Herbert Spencer as well, whose theses were being fiercely debated  </page> <page sequence="9"> PsyCho-reFlexology 227 in Russia around the turn of the century.29 Bekhterev extended Spencer’s  neo-Darwinian thesis, that the activity of the nervous system was an ad- justment of internal circumstances to external ones, by inverting it. “This  def inition, which has nearly become accepted, forgets that there is also a  modif ication of external conditions, that is, an accompanying adjustment  of external circumstances to internal circumstances.”30 This thesis of the  reciprocal effect of nerve impulses set a precedent for the orientation of  Petersburg artists toward reception physiology. The concept of “extensions  of man”, as McLuhan designated the electronic media as an extension of the  nervous system into the surroundings, has one of its most radical origins  in Russian psycho-reflexology. In his book about suggestion, Bekhterev distinguishes between an ac- cessible consciousness and an inaccessible one, which he assumed to be  collective. Although the technical terminology of contemporary psychology  suggested it differently, Bekhterev did not allow himself to designate this  inaccessible thing as the “unconscious”, since it remained unconscious only  for the subject itself, but not for objective psychology with its apparatuses,  measuring devices, and observations. Objective psychology can show that  an object of perception does not land in the “personal” consciousness in the  state of suggestion, “but in other areas of our psyche [...], which can be called  the collective consciousness.”31 The concept “collective consciousness” is the  basis for a psychological model that assumes a connection among subjects in  which, alongside pure language and conscious communication – as is evident  in the model of the telephone – all sorts of roaring is transmitted that no one  understands. These transmissions connect every individual personally and  directly with the “collective consciousness.” The individual is distracted and  scattered by it, but also socialized and cultivated or subjected to suggestions: In such cases the external impression passes by our personal conscious- ness, thus managing to reach the sphere of the psyche without our ‘ego.’  In this case it is not through the main entrance, but through the backdoor,  so to speak, that it lands directly in the inner chambers of the mind. [...]  Suggestion is thus the direct over-inoculation of certain mental states  from person to person.32 If Bekhterev’s examination of the paranoia of Malyonvanism ends with the  conclusion that mass suggestion has its origin in masses of suggestions, this  is only seemingly a tautology. In fact he founded the f irst mass psychology  that attempts to show that the reason for mass hysteria is not a single mad  leader, but physiological and cultural structures that provide the means for  </page> <page sequence="10"> 228 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  psychic mechanisms to run according to laws that can be studied objectively,  structures that make the “over-inoculation” of ideas possible. In 1905 this did  not result in discounting madness or possession as religious deviances, but  in studying them as a social phenomenon. At the time Bekhterev’s diagnosis  was enacted as an anti-tsarist demand to enlighten the Russian people, who  were drowning in misery and alcohol. In 1927, when Stalin showed that  he thought he had conquered the political-bureaucratic apparatus of the  Soviet Union as a single leader, the diagnosis of the intrepid psychiatrist was:  Even Stalin is just part of the apparatus, despite all despotism he is just its  secretary. The diagnosis of paranoia was thus not at all meant personally, but  was a subjective slight for Stalin, even if in the name of objective psychology. In the 1970s a manuscript turned up in Leningrad, long believed to have  been lost, of Bekhterev’s report that he had presented as a lecture to the  All-Union Congress “32 Hours before His Death.” In it Bekhterev presents  his “psychotherapeutic triad”: “explanatory lectures in the groups, group  hypnosis, and treatment by auto-suggestion.”33 Fifty years after his death,  Bekhterev was rediscovered in the socialist countries as the one who had  invented group therapy, before any American or French researcher. The  jubilation was mixed with slightly revanchist undertones in the Cold War  competition between psychiatric technicians, and it was aff irmed, against  all the anarchy of group formation, that Bekhterev had laid the founda- tions “for our psychotherapy, which respects the social determinacy of  human beings”, and therefore he was on the side of order.34 But it was not  quite so simple. Bekhterev viewed a person’s health as a question of the  functioning exchange between people and their surroundings. Reflexology  is fundamentally an ecology of relations.35 The honor given to Bekhterev in the German east could be traced back  above all to his attempts to provide therapy to alcoholics. His system- atic proposals and his neurologically based vision of collective processes,  however, remain without comment. The mixture of nerve physiology and  research on possession, which was only socially acceptable under the term  “psychic infection”,36 the numerous transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary  experiments, and also the medical self-reflection of reflexology seem to  have made Bekhterev suspect for all time and under all regimes. Personality Changes By the turn of the century, in order to create a secure basis for his research  and his researchers, Bekhterev had already planned for a private institute  </page> <page sequence="11"> PsyCho-reFlexology 229 “with a whole series of scientif ic disciplines for general research on the  personality, the training and hygiene of the mental sphere, and also to  set up courses to study the prophylaxis and cure of nervous and mental  diseases.”37 The institute had to attend to a serious lack in tsarist society.  “Due to the enormous number of attendees, it was necessary after a few  years to transform the courses of the Psychoneurological Institute into a  large private university (the f irst in Russia at the time), already accredited,  which comprised up to 8,000 students and was not inferior in either the  quantity nor the quality of the teaching staff to any Russian state university.  Here many people received their education who would not be accepted  into a state university under the current circumstances, which naturally  provoked the reluctance of the state professors and the government.”38 Those excluded from universities in the current circumstances in  St. Petersburg were, for example, women, who were already working in  Bekhterev’s laboratories as researchers and experiment leaders before the  turn of the century. Also excluded or subjected to strict quotas were Jews,  for instance one Solomon Derenkovsky, Maya Deren’s father, or one Denis  Kaufmann, who later became the f ilm director Dziga Vertov. Bekhterev’s  private initiative was necessary to constitute critical research and academic  public life in St. Petersburg: a legal space for minorities, which was also open  to artists, writers, and musicians. Under the tsar the Psychoneurological  Institute became a center of political critique and student unrest. Bekhterev  had defended civil liberties from the position of a nerve physiologist and  in 1906 (in contrast to Pavlov) advocated for academic autonomy without  compromise against the threat that the minister of defense would appoint  positions in the medical academy. In 1905 he wrote a general assessment of  living conditions in Russia from a psychiatric point of view as a manifesto  against suppression in schools, in the family and military, against prohibition  through legal practices, against the political police and the death penalty.  What he made available was the Personality and the Social Conditions of its  Development and Health, but no longer in the sense of a bourgeois individual,  but as part of a larger context of stimulus and reaction. The term personality thus contains, in addition to inner unity and  coordination, a certain activity in relation to the outer world, which is  grounded in the individual processing of external stimuli. [...] Mental  life is not only the sum of subjective experiences, but always also gives  expression to a certain group of objective appearances. It is these objec- tive appearances around which the personality enriches its external  social surroundings.39 </page> <page sequence="12"> 230 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  Bekhterev read the whole manifesto at the congress of psychiatrists and  neurologists, which had only been permitted by the Minister for Interior  Affairs on the condition that no topics outside the f ield be addressed.  Political movements, however, were not outside the professional concerns  of Bekhterev. The intentions of Vladimir Mikhailovich, who also wrote  plays, were exalted beyond any doubt: “...in Russia, in a country that is  backward and uncultivated in many respects, a man of science cannot get  around [...] having to provide answers to various questions of the sick social  entity.”40 160 million people lived in Imperial Russia, for whom there were  350 psychiatrists and neurologists. Bekhterev demanded what was not self- evident: health care for the mentally ill. In 1905, when “enormous violence  rolled over the whole empire as a reaction to the existing order of things,  the unsustainability of which [...] was imposing itself on the population”,41  reflexology showed itself as a mass psychology of the Napoleonic spirit: Why do the masses move inexorably at a mere wave of the leader [...],  why does everything strive toward the same goal as if on command?  [...] However one might think about this, and whether or not one wishes  to accept special ‘psychic waves’ that simultaneously extend over great  masses of people and are even supposed to be capable of a moving  backwards under certain circumstances, what cannot be doubted as  the bases of the whole appearance are the powerful effects of reciprocal  suggestion in masses of people. [...] Such mutual suggestion leads to a  kind of ‘electrical charge’ of singular individuals, whose sensations now  increase into extraordinary tension.42 In the “psychic waves” and “electrical charges” are the electrif ied media nets  without which the leaders of the uprisings of 1905 and 1917 could not have  brought their commands to the masses, presented as an ideal revolutionary  model from the control room of brain physiology. Bekhterev’s scientif ically  def ined agitation lends the artistic and dramaturgical metaphors of the  revolution a neurological foundation. The “shock theater”43 of Meyerhold  and Eisenstein invoked this research and and the concept of a personality  that enters into contact and exchange with its social surroundings when  something is communicated. This concept could only be conveyed with  great effort or incompletely without the corresponding reflex “social theory.”  Some German revolutionary theater artists were indignant. Piscator wrote: In an article published in the German press by Potemkin director S.M.  Eisenstein, he explained that he saw the task of the ‘Potemkin’ f ilm as  </page> <page sequence="13"> PsyCho-reFlexology 231 electrifying, jolting the spectator. If that really were the task of revolution- ary drama, the effect could be just as easily achieved by putting on a  boxing match.44 Brecht in fact adopted boxing as a dramaturgical model, and Vertov will  show how a boxing match would have to be presented in a cinematically  revolutionary way so that it took apart bourgeois consciousness in the  process of reception. Piscator was simply lacking psycho-physical insights.  In the Soviet Union, however, they varied as well. Eisenstein’s idea of a reflex  structure differs from that of Vertov’s as a central nerve system does from  one that is mapped in a net-like way. The methodology of the general, which Bekhterev really was, might even  have helped the tsar prolong his rule, quite in the sense of “sympathy for  the devil.” For Bekhterev added to his analysis of power in the age of mass  movements an instruction manual of collective unconscious electrif ication.  Far from idealistically dreaming up the liberation of the people as enlight- enment and maturity, Bekhterev published power-bestowing knowledge  beyond good and evil, to whom it may concern: Anyone who spends a lot of time with the people and has his own experi- ences knows what the value of logical persuasion is. In the best case it  only has a very slow effect, while suggestion through encouragement or  command almost always leads quickly and surely to the goal.45 The tsar did not wish to hear anything about experimentally tested propa- ganda. In 1917 the Psychoneurological Institute was once again the center  of the uprisings. First the new rulers appreciated the research: under the  Bolsheviks the institute was indeed dependent on state subsidies, but was  developed further. On 321⁄2 dessiatines of land within the city of Leningrad,  ten more buildings were constructed. Bekhterev published journals and  organized congresses on special psycho-neurological topics such as develop- ing personality, criminology, the psycho-physiology and ref lexology of  work, which are very similar to Münsterberg’s psycho-technology. For the  third edition of his General Principles of Human Reflexology in 1925, the  “second after the Revolution”, Bekhterev’s work is off icially recognized in  the foreword as the consummation of the history of psychology. Bekhterev’s  teaching on associative reflexes “paves the way to constructing an objective  teaching of the human personality.”46 The Bolsheviks, inspired by thoughts  of a mass empire that could be uniformly governed by general electrif ica- tion, welcomed the attempt to research the nervous system as the state basis  </page> <page sequence="14"> 232 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  in regulatable personality. In the model of the neurologists who conceived  the nervous circuitry according to the idea of the telegraph system, they  saw their own strategies in good hands. Ways of Behaving The signif icance of Bekhterev’s collective reflexology for an early history of  f ilm, however, is not only based on the idea of a general medium of transmis- sion that affectively links the body beyond its boundaries.47 What is more  important in terms of methodology is the reflexological principle that the  entire human being in its social multiplicity only gets access to observations  from outside. Processes “that we have always called ‘mental’”48 are only  recognized correctly through objective scientif ic observations “with their  strict methods, with their exact apparatuses and measurements.”49 In critical comparing the psychological schools and laboratories,  Bekhterev regrets that “self-observation is the reigning, if not the only  method of research”,50 and that even Münsterberg and Ebbinghaus ulti- mately had prescribed introspection. If he differentiates precisely in this  respect between memory and remembrance, Bekhterev f inds himself  surprisingly closer to psychoanalytic methods than to psychological  ones: “Experience shows [...] that self-observation is not even suff icient  to recognize one’s own psychic life.”51 It was appropriate, then, to draw  conclusions from experimental observations regardless of how test subjects  found or sensed their states. “Free from efforts and attempts to intrude into  the subjective world of dreams and fantasy, psycho-reflexology gives us  prose in place of poetry, for it observes the neuro-physiological functions  exclusively from the outside.”52 For ethical and presumably political reasons,  Bekhterev also criticizes conclusions by analogy in subjective psychology,  with which conclusions are drawn in the introspection of a subject about  another and thus about general experiences. This methodology precisely  takes for granted a general human consciousness, which does not exist all  according to the f indings of objective psychologists: “We deny the right  of subjectivist psychologists indiscriminately to extend, by using analogy  with themselves, the conclusion of their self-observation to the subjective  world of others and particularly to the subjective world of children, of  psychopaths, and of animals.”53 In protest, therefore, against a psychological truth that had already been  elevated to a dogma of a general human psyche before all research and  experimentation, and that already acclaimed to know how a subject had  </page> <page sequence="15"> PsyCho-reFlexology 233 to be attuned, Bekhterev had founded reflexology – the science that, due  to its history in the twentieth century, became a synonym for fantasies  of programming and consolidation: in behaviorism as a science of social  techniques of adjustment and in the adaptation of Pavlov’s theories of condi- tions reflexes for a totalitarian reason of state. Psycho-reflexology in the  sense of its initial founder, however, would have been concerned with the  differences of individual experience, with measurable personality rather  than the measure of the human being, because it examined not the essence,  but the conditions of its emergence, unfolding, and development on the basis  of a general principle of transmission. And a principle of transmission is  general if it is binding not only beyond philosophical frameworks, but also  beyond anthropomorphic ones, for human and animal, sane and insane,  protists, starfish, and voiceless infants. Psycho-reflexology is thus capable of  scientif ically demonstrating, in the middle of Communism, the inequality  and incomparability of human being and pig. The subject can only recognize its conditionality or damage when it is  observed by an outside, an other, or by apparatuses that depict the states of  the self as estranged and reflected. The reflexological method analyzes emo- tions as paths in the nervous circuit and in the general transfer of impulses,  discovering intersubjective relationships there. In contrast to traditional  psychology, in which “the goal of examining objective appearances was  to recognize the human soul”, reflexology explains “the raw relationships  to external influences or stimuli.”54 After the Revolution Bekhterev even  subsumed Marxism into reflexological knowledge: “Existence which deter- mines consciousness” is the activity of associative reflexes that can become  visible as “(in reflexological terminology) human behavior.”55 Behavior is thus to be understood as the complex reactions of psycho- physiological bodies to one another; reactions that the trembling, blushing,  or gasping individuals do not perceive in themselves, nor do they want to  perceive them from themselves. Reproduced technologically, however, they  can behave in relation to themselves. Nerve Priming In contrast to Freud, who, in order to found psychoanalysis, stopped  looking at hysterics and began listening to them, Bekhterev learned to  draw conclusions from observing patients in terms of the state of their  nerve conduction at the Salpêtrière. Even while still in Paris he began  to develop the foundations for a theory of personality as ref lex science  </page> <page sequence="16"> 234 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  from the correlations between disturbances of the nervous system and  the motor expressions observed. “The f irst attempts to approach the study  of personality objectively were made by me as early as 1885, when I was  studying traumatic psychoneuroses and hysteria.”56 In his assessment of  hysteria as the constriction of the f ield of consciousness, Bekhterev was  following Pierre Janet and f inding himself not so far from Leon Solomons’s  and Gertrude Stein’s conclusion that hysteria is “a disease of attention.”  If in doing so Bekhterev was invoking Radin’s theory of hysteria as the  disintegration of personality, then this was not in the sense of a pathologi- cal exceptional case, but as an appearance of collective, social lack. The  objective examination of hysterical symptoms only led to few, disturbed,  or wrongly connected nerve conductors.57 The study of nerve conduction was Bekhterev’s main focus during his time  in Leipzig. His handbook Conductors in the Brain and Marrow, published  in 1896, became a classic in the f ield, used as the basis for neurophysiology  even beyond the borders of German clinics. Bekhterev had written the f irst  edition in German, but already in 1899 the “second, completely revised, and  signif icantly expanded version”58 appeared, translated back into German  from the Russian and enhanced by the experiences had at the new labora- tory in Kazan, but still paying its respects to Paul Emil Flechsig as teacher  and advisor for the work. Wilhelm Wundt had also examined localizations of mental activity in  the cortex and described functional neuro-anatomical connections. His  theory that brain functions are different reactions to stimuli could also  have been considered the inspiration and initiation of Bekhterev’s concept  of association reflexes if Wundt had not made the jump from physiological  laws into mental ones in synthesizing the basic elements of neurology.  Wundt insisted that the individual components that could be examined  physiologically combined into complexes that represented more than the  sum of individual reactions, and out of which were formed the psychic  complexes, “consciousness” and “ego.” It was precisely this conclusion,  however, that Bekhterev would consider hasty, dismantling it on the editing  table of neuroanatomy. Flechsig, who was only ten years older than Bekhterev, was the more  important teacher59 for him in Leipzig, and during his short stay there  the two of them carried out a formidable and certainly merciless series  of experiments together, especially on the brains of human embryos and  newborns, which they got from God knows where. By means of successive  myelinogenesis of the nerve cords they represented the development stages  of the brain – Flechsig’s “myelinogenetic methods” – and localized the  </page> <page sequence="17"> PsyCho-reFlexology 235 “associative areas” in the nerves, which grow up in the end to be the organs  of mental activity.60 To this day, the representation of corporal sensation is  localized in the areas designated by Flechsig.61 Flechsig had outlined certain  areas in the brain as “spheres of bodily feeling”, in which the shape of the  body was illustrated. As an inner mirror relationship, this constituted the  “consciousness” in physiological reflexivity, in which the system of inner  perception is the f irst area that develops and with the the self-feeling of  every small child is more developed than motor self-control.62 Bekhterev  adopts this concept and its topology. From the correspondences he draws  the conclusion that all behavior is not simply the expression of mental  activity, but much more the mirror of all neurophysiological processes of  stimulus and reaction. Nonetheless, the idea that he has of the structure of  the conductors in the brain and marrow can be distinguished signif icantly  from that of Flechsig. Flechsig’s topography was passionately against the  democratization of the model of nerves in early research, which sought to  replace the idea of a hegemonic soul. “It is not the republic, but the monarchy  that is realized in the organization of the mental organs”, thought Flechsig.63  He had presented the coordination through associative centers as “com- mand hierarchies of the fabric of the nerves.”64 Bekhterev’s studies, on the other hand, especially concentrate on those  tracts that run between the various nerve centers, convolutions, cores,  functional joints, as if the hierarchical, monarchic structure from Flech- sig’s model of the brain wanted to be rhizomatically undermined by new  conductors. At any rate, determining some order in the nervous system,  in which “the individual f iber tracts in the marrow and the brain lie in  close contiguity without perceptible boundaries, often even commingling  [...] or form meshworks, even sometimes intersections”,65 is not an easy  task. Bekhterev viewed the “associative tracts” as “intrinsic f ibers” that  internally interconnected the cells of the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex  like a “functional collectivization of its various f iber systems.”66 Bekhterev  structures the topology and functions of the brain as anarchy, against the  position of his teacher, until he, much later, can describe the “function of  the brain” as “the most important apparatus of relating in communication  with the outside world.”67 As a last relay in the communication between inner and outer, nerves and  surroundings, the question of transmission or contact between the nervous  tracts had to be explained. Around the turn of the century there were two  competing hypotheses: one that assumed the continuity of the nervous  networks as a f ibrous mesh and the other being neuron theory, which,  following the research of Forel, His, and Ramón y Cajal, assumed discrete  </page> <page sequence="18"> 236 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  singular cells between which an impulse was transmitted. Bekhterev de- fended the neuron model for the brain. The nervous current, the quality of  which he could never explain, was to be understood as a series of successive,  discrete signals: I consider it much more correct to conceive of the nervous current as if  it it were composed of a series of successive stimuli that each land in the  individually following members of a nervous tract for development.68 When Bekhterev began to develop a psychology on the basis of ref lex,  the discovery of each new nerve connection, each new cervical area was  undiscovered territory in the topography of the body. Where before one  had assumed the amorphous soul, now there were functioning structures.  And so, as Bekhterev was assembling the reflexes, he was opening up new  opportunities to produce, manipulate, regulate, or destroy sensations and  relations. In this light it is possible to understand why Bekhterev’s concept  of personality as a connection of reflex complexes was such a productive  shock for the avant-garde of artists. The fact that the physical body and its  movements could be seen as material disclosure of the subtlest movements  and relations of nerves not only revolutionized the practice of acting, but  the entire apparatus of theater and the emerging cinema. Reflex Arcs Unlike Pavlov, who reduced the processes of perception to a pattern of  stimulus and reaction, Bekhterev researched the combinations of neuronal  microprocesses in order also to be able to understand thinking, speaking,  and remembering using the methodology of objective psychology. In the  last book that appeared during his lifetime, he designates reflexes as the  “correlative activity of individuals” in order to free them f inally from the  connotation of passive interconnection.69 Acting is the traversing of reflex  arcs, and reflexology is meant to become a universal science, in which “the  social interrelations between human beings” would be analyzed.70 As an homage to Flechsig, Bekhterev called the combined nerve priming  “associative”, which includes “all our gestures, such as laughing, crying, and  other physical movements.” Association was also conceived in the logics of  neuronal priming: “Every impression, no matter how it is called up, leaves  a certain trace in the nerve centers that can be reanimated, then appear- ing as as associative or psycho-reflex.”71 The topography of these traces is  </page> <page sequence="19"> PsyCho-reFlexology 237 personal experience, life experience, on whose traces, which determine  and therefore alter the following reactions of the organism as external  stimuli, new experience are laid down as new physiological nerve tracts.  So every personality develops a unique combination of nerves according  to the experiences that it has. Bekhterev considers the experiences inscribed in the body to be socially  transferable as well, for a tradition to be reproduced without the conscious- ness of the carrier. The science of physiologically stored stimulus receptions  and their processing by experiences thus becomes cultural theory: Here it is about a particular way of inheriting, to be called psychic inherit- ance, which in any case contributes more to f ixing psychic acquisition  in posterity than does the factor of physical heredity. The descendants  of a genius can die out, but his mental creations are taken up by many  and become f ixed through psychic inheritance in those who come after  him, thus becoming the possession of a whole series of generations.72 Here at the very latest Bekhterev goes beyond what can be considered a  reflex arc in science today, which only inherited Pavlov’s coup from reflexol- ogy. In nerve interconnections communication with the surroundings is  opened up as complex behavior, extended, and – this links Bekhterev with  the biologists and neurologists at Harvard – fed back: “the cortex of the  cerebrum, in association with lower centres, establishing a correlation of  the organism with the environment on the basis of individual experience.”73 Reflex tracts function through a physiological constraint as a storage  space. Thinking and remembering fall under these processes of correlation  that are interpreted and postponed with time. “The associative processes  influenced by operations of constraint often demand a signif icant time  interval until the reaction is triggered, so that in certain cases the reaction  can appear to be an independent appearance.”74 So what can be considered a  motor reflex is not only the act of speaking, but also complex operations like  giving speeches, reading letters, writing books, or earning money. This ex- pansion of the understanding of reflex was of course contested.75 Bekhterev’s  hypothesis that “consciousness”, “ego”, and all personal activity were made  up of reflex combinations, which could be completely explained through  biochemical processes, was not entirely original. Bekhterev would have  been able to draw on, for example, the teachers of Freud as predecessors  of reflexology: even Brücke, Meynert, and Exner had seen the foundations  of the ego as a thinking subject in the reflexes and their connections in a  system of cortical tracts. </page> <page sequence="20"> 238 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  What was new in Bekhterev’s proposal was that he followed the path of  stimuli and reactions beyond any anthropomorphic framework. Thanks to  objective examination aided by apparatuses, a complex view of reflex inter- actions in living creatures was opened up. In this case the cinematograph  is the aid to the objective psychologist. By enlarging motion, the camera  can make visible that the operations at the basis of nerve transmission are  the same in all living creatures: Cinematic representation of the movements of plants produces, as is well  known, the impression of quick animal movements. [...] we should see,  if our eye were constructed like a microscope, that growing stems and  roots execute groping movements, and, in any case, we should discover  prompt reactions as results of stimulation.76 Quite in the sense of Londe, the camera shows what the naked eye can- not recognize. In the series of these tropisms, ref lexology f inally also  places the behavior of human beings in those “complicated forms that  are conventionally described as acts.” These series of reflexes, which are  guided by a goal, “that is, by a stimulus”, can be traced back to “offense,  defense, concentration, and in certain cases to imitation and symbol- ism.” Neurological modal and cinematic illustration prove in turn to be  complementary. They provide, if they transcend the unity of the single  individual, the same discrete basic signals, from which the movement of  life itself is composed. “Feelings and emotions” are good examples of such reflex complexes.  Movements of an “emotional character” are called mimic ref lexes in  Bekhterev’s systematics. They are only partly observable: for instance as  facial gesture, breaking out in a sweat, blushing, or speeding up the rate of  breath. Mimicry is “obviously a very complicated and peculiar association  of the motor, secretory, and blood vessel reactions of the organism, which  can be distinguished in their complexity from simple reflex movements.  Nonetheless, these appearances run exactly as mechanically as do ordinary  reflexes”,77 wrote Bekhterev in 1913, when he formulated psycho-reflexology  for the f irst time as a “teaching.” Psycho-reflexological methods show ex- actly which physiological processes belong to an emotional complex. The  analysis of mimic movements is more complicated if the organic-reflex  movements appear as components of associated movements. The various  organic reactions were measured in Bekhterev’s laboratory according to  time, intensity, and in their phylogenetic and individual emergence, and  reflex mimicry was physiologically classif ied according to the perceiving  </page> <page sequence="21"> PsyCho-reFlexology 239 surfaces that they originated from.78 More complex associative reactions  come into being through the fact that an external impulse, for instance a  message arriving, is linked to life experience, to the traces of experience  in the brain. In every laugh and in every cry can be seen a mimic dissolve  of our biography as bodily experience. Obviously Bekhterev used photography at the Psychoneurological  Institute, but not serial photography or cinematography, which by then  was widely used in neurology. It is, however, possible that there are  archives in Bekhterev’s institute that have not yet been viewed. Unlike  Münsterberg, Bekhterev, who could have been an eyewitness to one of the  creative phases of cinema, was obviously not interested. But the theory  of technological illustration as reflex analysis or psycho-analysis can be  rediscovered in the works and kinoki manifestos of Dziga Vertov. Vertov  transformed Bekhterev’s thesis – that associated ref lex movements are  supra-individual, non-anthropomorphic, and can be bridged and linked by  means of technological apparatuses – into f ilm technique. In his Man with  a Movie Camera collective reflexology is realized in f ilm. Media or Homeostatic Processes After Bekhterev had disassembled the personality into the discrete single  parts of its basic neuronal functions, he f inally attempted to construct a  theory of relativity of the psychic process. But if matter is a f iction, and only energy is real, there is no ground for  the contraposition of the psychic to the material, and vice versa, and we  have ask ourselves: Is it not possible to reduce psychic activity, too, to  physical energy?79 Only after he had taken the analysis of nerve connectors as far as the  methods of natural science allowed, and after he had reconstructed the  transmission qualities of the nerve tracts in the laboratory and clini- cal practice and newly integrated them into his therapeutic forms did  Bekhterev publish his global theory of relations of a worldwide network  of nervous current, which might appear a metaphysical paranoia, but  he could actually prove the functions of all the individual connectors in  experiments. Bekhterev’s anarchism included the idea that vision was not  conceived as the world on a wire, but as a multiplicity of relations, which  animate reality as a f low of energy between parts, which are smaller than  </page> <page sequence="22"> 240 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  electrons, and between complexes that are larger than the planetary  system. In this way, also, the external world – of course, not that which we  perceive and imagine, but that which exists in reality –is subject to  the law of causality or, more accurately, to the laws of relations. And  when we prosecute our analysis to the end, we must acknowledge one  fundamental and f irst principle of all being, and this we call energy.  In the concept of energy we have the idea of various manifestations  of movement under the form of great masses [...]. To the basis of this  movement, a basis which must be common to all phenomena of nature,  including ourselves as a part of the universe, we give the name universal  energy.80 In this universality energy is reminiscent of Schreber’s rays. Paranoia and  science always lay side by side. Assuming a universal form of energy was nothing extraordinary at  the turn of the century. There were numerous models of nervous energy,  which were analogous to physical models and theories and were only  provisionally proposed in order to link up organic functions and mental  phenomena. Extending from Bergson’s philosophy of life, Pierre Janet had  proposed the “function de réel” as an effect of nervous energy on external  objects. Freud’s f irst neuron-machine model for the psyche, as he describes  it in Project for a Scientific Psychology, also runs with an energy that he  initially calls “quantity.” C.G. Jung’s somewhat later reform of the libido  as a form of energy also belong to these models.81 Bekhterev’s variant is  distinguished by letting the bodies simply become energy-transformers,  despite any Wagnerian tonic notes. When energy penetrates bodies, follows  ref lex arcs, establishes new connections, and then moves on, it leaves  behind experiences as the relay of energy. “But people are, i.e., they must  be regarded as energy accumulators resulting from their past individual  experience and hereditary influences”,82 is written in Collective Reflexol- ogy, the book that, as the second volume in the series “Contributions to  Mass Psychology” posthumously sent Bekhterev’s outrageous message  into the middle of Europe, to Halle. With his relativizing system of a world  energy, which is propagated by discrete impulses, as he had studied in  nerve stimuli, Bekhterev proposes a universal medium of transmission,  which at the same time conveys messages and links relations, which forms  personalities and at the same time turns them into the batteries for the  whole system. Neuronal circuits are linked to bio-social networks by  </page> <page sequence="23"> PsyCho-reFlexology 241 apparatuses. Every transmission alters both the experiential structure  of the body and the energy structure of the surroundings. The nerve  impulses therefore meet the def inition of signals, and the world-energy  that Bekhterev imagines is a network of messages that is far superior to  Siemens’s telegraph system, because it will one day process the structure  of the network itself. Bektherev’s mass psychology is a very early project  for a theory of technological media. Since there is a link between organs  of sense perception and expression by apparatuses, they also alter the  subjects of experience. In 1927 in Ohio Bekhterev’s lecture on feelings and emotions begins  surprisingly dramatically. Suddenly and without warning, opium and  hashish clearly showed how emotional states can be inf luenced by  external means. These drugs produce euphoria, just as adrenaline can  trigger fears or other poisons can precipitate depression. Just as abruptly,  Bekhterev raises the next topic: krov, blood. “Thus we see that the basis  of these states designated as feelings and emotions is alterations in the  composition of the blood.”83 This opening is more than a simple nod to  the institutional reorganization of psychological research at Wittenberg  College in its merger with chemistry. Bekhterev had also emphasized the  role of metabolism as part of the universal energetic system in a variety  of passages in his General Principles of Human Reflexology. Not only is  the human being nourished through metabolism, but it is also connected  to the universal energy through the sense organs and the nerves. The  biochemical side of Bektherev’s research, however, has always only been  a subordinate part, and the fact that he opened his lecture this way gives  an indication of the actual addressee of the message. If Bekhterev makes  controlling somatic-mimetic ref lexes by controlling blood composition  the secret topic of his lecture, extending the neuronal ref lexology to  include chemical ref lexology, it is clear that he, whether present or not,  was speaking to Walter Cannon, and that he was trying to position his  bio-social studies in the context of the biochemical experiments by  the physiologists at Harvard Medical School. In his lecture, Bekhterev  continues: The glands can, and undoubtedly do, react to the chemical composi- tion of the blood (chemical reflexes). Thus there is established a sort of  equilibrium between the various glands, due to the direct effect of the  chemical composition of the blood upon the chemical elements of the  glands themselves.84 </page> <page sequence="24"> 242 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  Using the word “equilibrium”, Bekhterev was speaking to what interested  him in Cannon’s research. Cannon had advanced the f irst thesis on ho- meostatic processes in the human body and experimentally verif ied them.  Even the term homeostasis was his. Cannon was, on the one hand due  to his own research, which regarded the body as an ecological interac- tive environment, and on the other as the teacher of the Mexican Arturo  Rosenblueth, with whom Norbert Wiener collaborated, the pioneer of  cybernetics on both the medical and biological side. In 1956 Wiener wrote  in his autobiography: Walter Cannon, going back to Claude Bernard, emphasized that the  health and even the very existence of the body depends on what are  called homeostatic processes. [...] That is, the apparent equilibrium of life  is an active equilibrium, in which each deviation from the norm brings  on a reaction in the opposite direction, which is of the nature of what we  call negative feedback.85 The f irst experiments on physiological feedback, which brought together  the physician Rosenblueth, the physiologist Cannon, and the mathemati- cian Wiener, were, incidentally, those on the impressions of muscular  joints, body specif ic responses to the state of the organs in movement,  the old dancer problem, which Bekhterev had also and independently  researched and had described in his Objective Psychology.86 According to his  own statements he had been dealing with this topic for some time already.  “Since the beginning of the eighties, my attention has been focused on the  functions of equilibrium or of the organs serving static coordination, which  at the time was a question that had not been examined much.”87 The nerve  physiologist wanted to f ind this principle of equilibrium and balance in the  body for all bodily processes. Both Rosenblueth’s American experiments  and Bekhterev’s were aimed at researching nerves as control systems, in  order then to f ind out that they could be affected and, according to their  physiological surroundings, also modeled. From this developed the concept  of a neurology that would at the same time be social technology. Cannon  had examined the biochemical side of these processes and his studies  on voodoo death were meant to show what happens when homeostatic  systems are taken out of equilibrium by purely social actions, a curse in  this case. In his lecture Bekhterev also explained that affective and emotional  reactions that were seemingly outdated phylogenetically, such as threat- ening gestures, or even blushing or sweating, are also completely sensible  </page> <page sequence="25"> PsyCho-reFlexology 243 ref lexes since transmitting impulses between individuals were encour- aged or obstructed by this. Even in social situation, intra-physiological  or inner-physiological control systems communicate with one another  in order to instigate the optimal exchange of energies. “Feelings and  emotions”, or “somatic-mimic ref lexes” as they are called in Objective  Psychology, represent a complicated and delicate corporal system of com- munication, and the individual need not know anything about in order  for it to work. In this context Bekhterev had advanced the thesis that  the corresponding ref lex tracts or channels are not only so for biologi- cal impulses and signals, but also social ones. “In the case of man the  sources of excitation are to be found not only in biological, but in the  social environment, especially the latter. It is these social excitations that  make man a bio-social being.”88 In the twenties this research was still “questions that had not been  examined much”, and there were not many centers in the world where they  were so intensively examined than at the Medical School at Harvard or at  MIT. And there was hardly anywhere that this research was so systemati- cally pursued in clinical practice than at the Psychoneurological Institute  in Leningrad. Alongside a few attempts with psycho-pharmaceuticals  Bekhterev’s practice primarily focused on hypnotic group therapy, which  was meant to initiate intersubjective homeostasis – similar forms of  therapy, following systematic, cybernetic models, were developed for  schizophrenia patients in the USA only in the sixties by Gregory Bateson  and his colleagues.89 Bekhterev was very familiar with Cannon’s research, including his  most recent experiments on altering the concentration of adrenalin in the  blood, and he was obviously attempting to create a connection to his own  experiments. In Ohio in 1927 Bekhterev wanted to make contact with those  whose research was the most advanced at the time, and to speak about the  science that – as the signif icance of the Macy Conferences would show in  the forties – was to be the science of the future. His lecture in Ohio was  obviously an attempt to consolidate neuronal and biochemical homeostasis  into a theory of the biosocial – or at least to discuss the possibility of such  a “fundamental basis for everything that exists.” World energy, according  to Bekhterev’s wish, was meant to be a scientif ic fusion of east and west, a  homeostatic force. Cannon took the call from the Soviet Union seriously and posed two  questions following Bekhterev’s lecture that show that he had clearly carried  out similar experiments with different results. In his own lecture Neural  Organization for Emotional Expression, a short history of the uses and abuses  </page> <page sequence="26"> 244 Cinema, TranCe and CyberneTiCs  of f its of rage, he had only cited Bekhterev from very old experiments from  his time with Flechsig. He seemed not to be familiar with the new develop- ments from Leningrad or, worse, they did not interest him. The historical  encounter between the two proto-cyberneticists ends in the darkness of  the protocol: “Dr. Walter B. Cannon requested that the following question  may be submitted to Dr. Bekhterev”, we read, then the daily minutes end.  And while in Ohio chemistry and psychology were being fused, in the name  of hormones and vitamins, into a single science that was meant to control  feelings in a more contemporary way than opium and hashish, in Moscow  power was being seized in the old style. Bekhterev’s last work, Collective Psychology, is an elegant synthesis of  all his research, at once mass psychology, war psychology, psycho-history,  political theory, and – social critique from the perspective of objective  psychology. What Bekhterev opposes to Flechsig’s “ethics grounded in physi- ology”90 as the coming project of a biosocial society are accumulator-bodies,  linked to one another but at the same time freely developing, which learn  and learn to learn in exchange with their surroundings, much like anti- authoritarian cyberneticists like Bateson and von Foerster will imagine and  try out much later. If we take Cannon’s and Bekhterev’s research seriously,  feelings would be chemo-neurological complexes that guide social life, an  “autopoietic” variant of reflexology according to Maturana and Varela. In  1913 Bekhterev had imagined that the organism, due to its neuropsychic activity, represents a machine that  is in a certain sense self-determinant and self-actuating. This is why its  outward reactions are not only determined by the external qualities of  the source of the stimulus, but also by its relations to the organism, which  has been shaped under the effect of inherited and acquired conditions.91 The utopia of a society mediated by feelings and emotions remained  Bekhterev’s dream: “Like a living organism, society represents a dynamic  equilibrium rather than something static.”92 No one wanted to know anything about any good-natured application of  multifaceted feelings, about any collective dance of the spheres of bodily  feeling. Much less about their abrupt mass feelings. In the Soviet Union  this ended after Bekhterev’s death in quite coarse propaganda assaults on  the people. In the USA the results of research were ref ined. Emotions were  simply supposed to be what cannot be decoded in the media transmissions  of the enemy. At the beginning of the Second World War the Off ice of War  Information provided its directors with the following: </page> <page sequence="27"> PsyCho-reFlexology 245 ‘How to arouse emotions of the apathetic, and direct the energies of the  frustrated into the war effort, is the informational Challenge.’ That was  domestic information from the OWI, with an emphasis on emotion and  not intelligence or education which its Soviet or Nazi counterparts could  have easily understood.93 Not much was left of all the research, all the high-ranking symposia, all  the publications. All that “feelings and emotions” attested to now were  the remaining traces of the human in the function of the medial. And yet,  cinema people turn up over and over again that bring the dream of the  unknown Bekhterev to the screen. </page> <page sequence="28"> dziga vertov, Jumping Top.
