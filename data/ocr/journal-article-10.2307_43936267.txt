<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ETRUSCANS By Herbert G. Menttnk Central College, Pella, Iowa ASEA has a dynamic voyage, writes effect Toynbee, upon the has a dynamic effect upon the life of a community. I am quite cer- tain that this statement holds true for individuals also. At any rate, it is largely because of my voyage to Italy, in the summer of 1963, that I became interested in Etruscology. The contri- butions of the Etruscans to the ori- gins and early history of Rome led me further to pursue this study. If you are looking for a fascinating subject, here it is. I have yet to come upon a writer who can refrain from such ad- jectives as amazing, fascinating, mys- terious, baffling, enigmatic, puzzling, and ambiguous when he speaks of the Etruscans. I have had a similar experi- ence. When did the amazing and fasci- nating Etruscans first arrive in Italy, where did they come from, and who were they? We know they reached Tuscany early in the ninth century B.C., but interpretation of their ori- gin and identity is another matter. The ancients themselves based their understanding largely on literary sources and not on the linguistic and archaeological evidence relied upon by modern scholars. Herodotus re- corded the tradition that the Etrus- cans were immigrants from the west coast of Asia, and Vergil, Ovid, and Horace often call them Lydians. But we must recognize that Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who also lived in Rome under Augustus, insisted that they were a native Italian people. At least we may with some degree of certainty reject the theory that they were invaders who entered Italy by way of the Alpine passes, nor do we feel that they should be identified with the Tursha, one of the sea peo- ple who raided Egypt about 1226 B.C. Much of our information about the Etruscans comes from Roman writers. Vergil, for example, pays much attention to the Etruscan heri- tage - some feel that he may have been of Etruscan descent. In all prob- ability he borrowed from the Etrus- can legends of his time. The writings of Livy also give considerable space to the Etruscans and their rule in Rome, for according to the tradition he followed the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. were occupied by the reigns of three Etruscan kings. But, like a true Roman, Livy is also quick to tell us of the expulsion of the Tar- quins from Rome. The arrival of the Etruscan princes in Rome and other Latin villages was a most important fact in the devel- opment of the Italic race. Their in- fluence was particularly evident in the development of the city state and of a type of serfdom in the land dis- tricts and farming regions, in the building of drainage canals and other engineering accomplishments such as roads, temples, and city walls, and last</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK Page 9 but not least in the area of commerce, trade, and industry. We shall speak more of these later. Let us first devote some attention to a particularly difficult question, one that has puzzled many scholars and defied repeated attempts to solve it: the decipherment of the Etruscan language. Many of the extant inscrip- tions which are limited to a few words can now be interpreted without too much trouble, but major problems arise with the longer inscriptions. Some think they are written in an alphabet adopted either from the western Greek alphabet via Cumae after the Etruscan settlement in Italy or else, more likely, at an earlier date from the Greeks in the eastern Medi- terranean. The value of the Etruscan letters is known, so that we can as- certain the meaning of many words, and we have something of an Etrus- can grammar; yet the attempts to translate the language completely have so far failed. The challenge of this language riddle, which has long baffled the deftest efforts of philol- ogy, still remains. Whether the Et- ruscan language itself is a pre-Indo- European speech of Asia Minor is likewise still a very debatable ques- tion. In part at least the Etruscan lan- guage survived as a spoken language in Italy as late as the second century A.D., and the Emperor Claudius (41- 54 A.D.) must have had ample writ- ten material at his disposal to com- pose his twenty books on Etruscan history and civilization, all of them unfortunately lost. The Latin vocabu- lary still contains a certain number of words of Etruscan origin, such as his- trio , atrium, and mundus , to mention just a few. There is also the intimate fusion of Etruscan and Latin nomen- clature and the Etruscan custom of using praenomen , nomen , and cog- no?nen. It is possible also that at least three of Rome's seven hills - the Pala- tine, the Velia, and the Caelian - were named after Etruscan families. In ad- dition, the three oldest groups of équi- tés bear Etruscan names: Ramnes, Tides, Luceres; to quote Varro, "om- nia haec vocabula Tusca." Etruscan literature must have come into existence some time during or after the ninth century B.C. Roman literature is much indebted to its contacts with Greece, but many scholars believe that, at an earlier period, Etruria exercised an impor- tant influence and that much of the philosophical and literary impulse commonly ascribed to Greece was, in its elements at least, really due to the Etruscans. Although it is not easy to be absolutely confident, one thing is very certain: the Etruscans did not have the same taste and gift for litera- ture as they had for art, architecture, sculpture, engineering, commerce, and industry. That they did have some literary prestige is clear from the writings of Livy, Varro, Horace, Aulus Gellius, and others who refer to the literature of the Etruscans. If there was an intellectual vacuum in their society, the Etruscans re- VERGIL'S BIRTHDAY " Wielder of the stateliest measure Ever moulded by the lips of man " Vergil was born on October 15, 70 B.C. Why not celebrate his birthday in Latin class, club, or assembly? deemed themselves partially by their passion for music, for they were skilled in the use of flute, lyre, and trumpet, and enjoyed folk and inter- pretative dancing of all kinds. In the world of letters the Etrus- cans were themselves indebted to the Greeks; there is much reference in their literature to Hellenic mythol- ogy. The most important part of their literature was, however, religious in character, and it is their complex religion which now demands our at- tention. No people in the west were more given to rites of every conceivable type than the Etruscans. Livy calls Etruria the most religious of nations. Arnobius calls her the "Mother of Superstitions." Of all the traditions which Rome inherited from the Etruscans, religion was the most sig- nificant. All Etruscan life was sur- rounded and saturated by a system of rites, ceremonies, and rules of con- duct. There naturally resulted a close contact between religious and secular life, for every act was enveloped in an atmosphere of religion. The most striking aspect of this religion was the so-called disciplina . The Etruscan priests, the haruspices , were skilled experts in the rules of a complex theology and masters in the art of divination. To the Etruscans, storms, entrails, phenomena of any and all sorts meant divine interven- tion and direction, as Seneca, Cicero, and Pliny the Elder frequently point out. But it should be noted that the Etruscan religion was not necessarily pervaded with fear and gloom; many of the wall paintings in the tombs por- tray the early Etruscans as a joyous, life-accepting people. Under Greek influence the Etruscan gods became personalized and anthropomorphic. First among them was Tinia, later the Roman Jupiter. With him were as- sociated Uni (Juno) and Minerva. Together they formed a celestial triad whose temple stood in every Etruscan city, as well as on the Capitoline Hill in Rome. Because of their passionate love for the sea, the Etruscans also had a particular devotion to Neth- unus (Neptune). Turmo (Mercury) was associated with funeral rites, Vol- tumna (later Vertumnus) with festi- vals, Tekum (Ceres) with the harvest, and Charum (Charon) with the un- derworld. Because of their belief in a future life, the Etruscans preferred inhumation to cremation. To win the favor of the gods they at times were willing to sacrifice living persons. Their elaborate burial places are am- ple proof of their emphasis on the religious, and their somber cities of the dead reflect their view of life beyond death. Everyone knows that modern knowledge of the Etruscans, the first urban and highly civilized people of Italy, is largely derived from the ruins of their cities and more particularly from their tombs, tombs of many kinds and times. There are the trench tombs of Villanovan times, the tumuli, the famous mushroom-shaped tombs, the grass-covered mounds, the circu- lar stone vaults built into the hillsides, the corridor family tombs hewn out of rocks, and the chamber tombs, plus countless sarcophagi. All these with their wall paintings, pottery, metal vases, furniture, jewelry, wea- pons, and other personal possessions give us a vital picture of the cultural life of the Etruscans. The visitor to Caere, Tarquinii, Praeneste, and simi- lar places has a most unusual treat in store for him. Etruscan art is an area where a great difference of opinion exists, for much has been written on this subject, and there still is much dialogue as to the originality of Etruscan art. Some definitely feel that it is purely pro- vincial and a mere reflection of the Greek art which was its model. An opposing point of view insists that Etruscan art has certain unique char- acteristics and is strictly autochthon- ous. Certainly no one would dare to deny that it benefitted much from Hellenic models. But it is not there- fore merely a servile imitation with- out any real personality of its own. Etruscan art shows trends, gifts, and a spirit that represent the achieve- ment of the first people to develop a civilization worthy of the name Tus- can. We must recognize that Etruscan</page><page sequence="3">Page io THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK artists were influenced by those of the Near East and Greece with whom they had had earlier contact. Yet it seems to us that the art of the Etrus- cans was their most enduring and remarkable achievement, and that their religion gave it occasion and impulse, as is evident in their temples and tombs. Etruscan sculpture was outstanding. Clay and bronze, not marble, were the mediums, and their sculpture is well represented in such pieces as the Apollo from Veii, the Arringatore (Orator), the roaring Chimaera, the She- Wolf, the Warrior, and the Con- test for the Sacred Hind, many of them dating back to c. 500 B.C. and all classic examples of terra cotta and bronze works. Although Etruscan painting is not of special significance, it too reached an unusual develop- ment, mainly in the wall paintings in the tombs at Caere and Tarquinii, in which there is remarkable evidence also of their skill in producing jewel- ry and weapons of various descrip- tions. In engineering and architecture the Romans were especially indebted to the Etruscans, particularly in the use of the arch and vault, prominent in gateways, arches, sewers, bridges, aqueducts, and even in homes and temples. It is interesting to note that Etruscan cities were generally laid out in a regular plan with the two main streets crossing each other at right angles, like the cardo and decu- manus of the later Roman camp. The first buildings to be erected in a new settlement were always the temples for the gods and the palaces for the kings. These cities were located at strategic places, depending upon eco- nomic or military reasons. Some of them were fortified by walls of solid masonry, thirty feet high and as much as thirteen feet thick. While the Etruscan conquerors generally put their subjects to work at lumbering and farming and other occupations, they themselves showed great skill in mining and the metal trades and in the making of bucchero pottery. They also engaged widely in commerce and trade, for they were a sea-faring people and for a time con- trolled much of the sea. Another striking feature of early Etruscan society was a highly devel- oped family life, marked by the noble status of women. Etruscan family life was quite unique in the ancient world. More comradely than the Greek, less patriarchal and authoritarian than the Roman, and not so inhibiting and as- cetic as the early Christian, it was based largely on the equality of par- ents, on comradeship and mutual re- spect. Not only did women have great freedom in social intercourse, but often descent was reckoned on the maternal rather than on the pa- ternal side. How did it happen that a people with these qualities experienced a rather sudden fall after a relatively short period of prosperity? In spite of the speed and vigor of their ex- pansion, the Etruscans were unable to prevent armed uprisings of rebelli- ous subjects or to defend their con- quests against the Romans, Greeks, Samnites, and Gauls. Perhaps their basic weakness was their inability to establish a stable political organiza- tion and a uniform military command. The real power in the state was at all times in the hands of a small circle of influential landowners, the lucumo- nes . Other reasons may have been the unbounded luxury and the gross im- morality of which there is evidence, for example, in the bloodthirsty glad- iatorial combats. With the passage of time sensual indulgences of every kind seem to have sapped the strength of the people, and their aristocratic and arrogant rule could eventually no longer be endured. At any rate, in 509 B.C. the Romans drove out the last Tarquinian king; in 474 the Etruscans suffered a damaging naval disaster at Syracuse; in 396 a Roman offensive resulted in the capture of Veii, which was followed by Gallic invasions; and by the beginning of the third century Etruria no longer counted as an in- dependent power. Its culture and heritage, however, continued to ad- vance until the first century B.C.</page></plain_text>
