<plain_text><page sequence="1">JBL 130, no. 4 (2011): 625-642 Echoes of Gilgamesh in the Jacob Story ESTHER J. HAMORI ehamori@uts.columbia.edu Union Theological Seminary, New York, NY 10027 It was popular for some time to seek apparent Near Eastern parallels to bibli cal narratives. The methodology employed was at times problematic, and conclu sions were often overstated, as similarities between texts explicable in any number of ways were attributed to direct relationship.1 For some biblical texts, of course, there is stronger evidence for Near Eastern influence. I propose that this is the case in regard to one text for which a Near Eastern counterpart has not previously been suggested: the story of Jacobs wrestling match in Gen 32:23-33 (Eng. 32:22-32). There is reason to believe that the Israelite author knew some form of Gilgamesh, and particularly the scene of the wrestling match between Gilgamesh and Enkidu.2 The case presented here is not simply one of a shared motif or logical group ing of elements, but one of an unexpected and striking series of correspondences 1 For useful discussions, see esp.

The two stories in question share several elements that are each highly unusual and that bear no inherent relation to one another. Moreover, these features occur in the same order in the two texts. This is not to suggest that the author of the Israelite text sat looking at a copy of Gilgamesh. However, the unlikely cluster of correspondences, with the same sequence of uncommon elements, implies the author s familiarity with the story. I will argue here that the Israelite author utilized—and skillfully subverted—the framework familiar from Gilgamesh in composing the story of Jacobs wrestling match, and that this use sheds light on the aim of the Genesis passage. While the larger stories of Jacob and Gilgamesh are very different, each includes a critical scene featuring a type of unarmed combat notably distinct from representations of fighting found in other ancient Near Eastern literature. Many significant elements of the wrestling scenes are shared by the two stories, includ ing the manner, purpose, and outcome of the fight; each of these elements stands out from common portrayals of fighting found elsewhere in the Near East. The text with the relevant material is found already in the Old Babylonian version of the Gilgamesh Epic (Pennsylvania tablet [P] 200-239).3 The wrestling match performs a pivotal function in each story. The story of Jacob is characterized by the search, or even struggle, for blessing. This theme reaches its climax in the wrestling scene. Here Jacob is blessed directly by a divine agent and is given his name, his title as the father of Israel. After this scene (setting aside the P addition of the text in ch. 35, which combines material from chs. 28 and 32), the adventures of Jacob come to a close and the character retreats to a sec ondary role. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, before the fight Gilgamesh's rule is harsh and his people are distraught; after it, the formerly unbearable ruler stops tor menting the people of Uruk and directs his attention toward more worthwhile endeavors. In the fight he meets his match, the man who will tame him, and through it he gains his most loyal companion, around whom much of the epic revolves. The function of the two wrestling scenes is not the same—in the Jacob cycle it provides resolution close to the end of the hero's story, and in Gilgamesh the conflict and resolution lay the foundation for the continuation of the story. The reason for this difference lies in the particular perspective of the Israelite text. I. Parallels between the Wrestling Scenes Many intriguing parallels stand out between the fight scenes. In each story the hero is met at night by his opponent, who begins the fight. The antagonist is 3 AU translations of Akkadian and Hebrew are original.

George, The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts (2 vols.; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003).</page><page sequence="3">Hamori:Hamori: Echoes ofGilgamesh in the Jacob Story 627 divine or divinely created for this very purpose. This aggressor is not known by the hero at the time of the attack. The hero, however, is known to him. The aggressor provokes the hero to unarmed combat. They wrestle, though in neither case is the bout intended to be a fight to the death. Rather, in both stories the match func tions as a rite of passage. In neither case is there a traditional end to the fight. In addition to unusual lack of lethal intent, there is also no decisive move that would provide a logical conclusion to the match. Each hero at some point simply lets his attacker go, and the latter ceases to be seen as an antagonist. The hero is somehow appeased, and his opponent blesses him.4 In both cases it is the hero who is attacked while he goes on his way one night: Jacob on his way back to Canaan across the Jabbok, and Gilgamesh on his way into a wedding celebration. It is just on the threshold that each man is accosted by an unknown assailant. Each hero is deliberately sought out by his opponent: Jacob was left alone at night when "a man wrestled with him," and Gilgamesh was engaging in his customary wedding-night activities when Enkidu blocked the door to chal lenge him (P 198-99). The antagonist is divine or a divine agent in both texts. Jacobs attacker is the איש ("man") who shows himself to be God. He renames Jacob Yisra-El, explaining that Jacob has striven with God. He blesses Jacob, and when Jacob realizes that he has encountered God, he responds by naming the place Peni-El, explaining that he has seen God face to face. The figure who names Jacob Israel and blesses him, the man of whom Jacob says, "I have seen God face to face," is God himself.5 In the Gilgamesh story, Enkidu has been created by the gods expressly for the purpose of fighting this round with the hero. Anu responds to the lament of the people of Uruk by summoning Aruru to create a match for Gilgamesh, one equal in strength, in order to contend with him (I 92-104). While the scene of Enkidu's creation is not attested in the OB version, the dreams of Gilgamesh are, and these represent the divine sending of Enkidu to Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh dreams that an object falls from heaven before him but is too heavy for him to lift; he pushes at it but cannot move it (P 7-9). With the help of the townsmen, he brings it home to his mother. Upon hearing this dream, his mother explains that Enkidu will come to him, and Gil gamesh will embrace him. The difference between the divine man in Genesis and the divinely sent man in Gilgamesh is not to be overlooked: this is an important indication that the Israelite author is not content to adopt a story line but intends something quite dif 4 All of these elements are in Old Babylonian (OB) Gilgamesh, with the exception of the divine creation of Enkidu (extant only in the Standard Babylonian Version [SBV]), discussed below. 5 For my detailed analysis of the איש theophany, see Esther J. Hamori, "When Gods Were Men":Men": The Embodied God in Biblical and Near Eastern Literature (BZAW 384; Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 2008).</page><page sequence="4">628 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 4 (2011) ferent from the Gilgamesh text. The significance of this difference will be addressed later. In each story, the identity of the attacker is not made known to the hero until the end of the fight. Jacob asks his opponent his name, and it is when the איש responds, "Why do you ask my name?" and blesses him, that Jacob recognizes the figure's divine identity and declares, "I have seen God face to face, and my life has been delivered" (Gen 32:29, 30). Gilgamesh, too, is surprised by his unknown attacker, who blocks his way, provoking him to a fight. It is only in the next intel ligible scene that the two kiss one another and become friends (Yale tablet [Y] 18).6 So far, then, we have unknown divine agents who appear at night and pro voke the heroes to a fight. Another parallel, and one of great significance, is the lack of intention to fight to the death evident in both matches. Presumably because of the dearth of biblical and Near Eastern references to such nonmortal combat, some have theorized that Jacobs fight was in fact intended to be a lethal encounter.7 It seems that the best foundation for this argument is that engaging in combat was indeed generally assumed to be an act of life-threatening aggression. The descrip tions of the combat in these two scenes, however, do not give any indication that the fights were meant to be lethal. On the contrary, elements of the two stories reveal that neither episode was intended to be a fight to the death. It is of course clear in literary terms that Jacobs fight could not be deadly. Jacob must survive in order to become Israel, and there is no question of the איש being killed; unless both parties survive, there can be no future to the story. Additionally, the basis of Jacob's blessing as the father of Israel is his victory in this fight. The איש says to his wrestling partner, "Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed" (Gen 32:28). At this point, one might argue that this demonstrates only that the author of the text intended the outcome of the fight to be as it is and that this implies noth ing about the intention of the characters; the author may have written a nonlethal ending to what (for the characters) might have been mortal combat. The intention of the author must lie deeper than this, however. The core elements of the story demonstrate that the resolution of the fight is not the outcome of what might have been a death match. On the contrary, the characters themselves are portrayed as 6 For the argument that the Pennsylvania tablet (tablet II) and the Yale tablet (tablet III) should be read together, see Jeffrey H. Tigay, "Was There an Integrated Gilgamesh Epic in the Old Babylonian Period?" in Essays on the Ancient Near East in Memory of Jacob Joel Finkelstein (ed. Maria de Jong Ellis; Memoirs of the Connecticut Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences 19; Hamden, CT: Archon, 1977), 215-18; and George, Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, 1:159-62. 7 See, e.g., Claus Westermann, Genesis: A Commentary (trans. John J. Scullion; 3 vols.; Min neapolis: Augsburg, 1985), 2:516; Hermann Gunkel, Genesis (1901; trans. Mark E. Biddle; Mer cer Library of Biblical Studies; Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1997), 349.</page><page sequence="5">Hamori:Hamori: Echoes ofGilgamesh in the Jacob Story 629 consciously engaging in nonlethal combat. The איש wants to go before the sun rises, and so he tries to disable Jacob—not to kill him. Jacob agrees to let him go once he blesses him. Neither character is portrayed as having any intention of killing the other. The same want of lethal intent is visible in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Here too there is a point at which the partners seem to agree to stop fighting, and the hero lets his attacker go. Gilgamesh simply releases Enkidu when he ceases to be angry. Like boys in the schoolyard, when they are exhausted the one helps the other up and they become the best of friends. The combat is a rite of passage, not a duel to the death. Moreover, it is made perfectly clear from the start of the epic that Enkidu is created to be an equal match for Gilgamesh and to contend with him so that Uruk might be at peace, and Gilgamesh is certainly a changed man after his encounter with Enkidu. Enkidu was not sent to enter potentially lethal combat; he was sent to wrestle Gilgamesh to his senses. In addition to the striking lack of lethal intent in these two fights, it is highly unusual that both sets of partners engage in unarmed combat. Ancient Near East ern references to wrestling—that is, to unarmed combat either classified by a term "wrestling" or described as what we know to be wrestling—do not generally appear in the context of spontaneous fighting. Rather, when wrestling is mentioned, the reference seems to be either to sport, or to an event that has specific military impli cations. Several scholars have compared the wrestling of Gilgamesh to that of the Sumerian king Shulgi.8 Shulgi, however, boasts specifically about his prowess in "wrestling and athletics" (Hymn B:129). In addition, when describing in detail his life as a warrior, Shulgi mentions the javelin, sword, arrow, boomerang, lasso, pro jectiles, spear, sling, and slingstone—a man not known as a hero of unarmed com bat, one might conclude. In short, Shulgi's fame in wrestling was restricted to his athletic endeavors; his fame as a warrior was restricted to the use of weaponry and bore no relation to unarmed combat.9 This is a description not of spontaneous fighting but of wrestling as athletic competition, as also in the Marriage of Martu. The wrestling contests at the new year's festival would also fall into this category.10 8 See, e.g., Jeffrey H. Tigay, The Evolution of the Gilgamesh Epic (1982; repr., Wauconda, IL: Bolchazy-Carducci, 2002), 187. 9 Giorgio R. Castellino, Two Sulgi Hymns (Studia semitici 42; Rome: Istituto di studi del Vicino Oriente, Università, 1972), 40-41,257. In the SBV, Gilgamesh too is praised for his weapons (165). Indeed, part of the general pattern for royal hymns included the portrayal of kings as hav ing expertise with weapons. See, e.g., Amélie Kuhrt, The Ancient Near East, c. 3000-330 BC (2 vols.; London: Routledge, 1995), 1:68. 10 See, e.g., Karel van der Toorn, Family Religion in Babylonia, Syria, and Israel: Continuity and and Change in the Forms of Religious Life (Studies in the History and Culture of the Ancient Near East 7; Leiden: Brill, 1996), 16.</page><page sequence="6">630 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 4 (2011) When not mentioned in the context of athletics, unarmed combat generally has military implications, as in the Mari letter that refers to Zimri-Lim metaphor ically wrestling his adversary Ishme-Dagan (ARM 26 207 = ARM 10 4).11 It is added, however, that the head of Ishme-Dagan will be cut off and that his armies will not come to fight Zimri-Lim once their leader has been killed. Even in this prophetic image of national conflict, the description of unarmed combat is explic itly of a fight to the death, and the overall goal is military in nature.12 Furthermore, the very fact of unarmed combat is unusual. Even gods gener ally fight with weapons. Anzu and Ninurta engage in armed combat, for example; Tiamat and Marduk battle with weapons, and the gods around them are armed as well. The outcomes of the fights of Jacob and Gilgamesh further elucidate the par allel between the stories. While some have left room for the possibility that Jacob did not win his fight (e.g., Claus Westermann and Walter Brueggemann), the main stream conclusion has been that in the end the upper hand was Jacobs.13 Certainly, leaving aside the issue of what can constitute victory in any formal sense in unarmed nonlethal combat, it can be seen that the איש requested to be let go, Jacob agreed to release him on one condition, the condition was met, and the fighting subsided. Moreover, the blessing that Jacob received in answer to his one condi tion stated that in fact he had prevailed over human beings and over God.14 Gilgamesh too was paired with an equal, and in this text there has been much more disagreement as to who prevailed. The description of the struggle itself offers 11 Jean-Marie Durand argues that the word humàlum in this text refers to a cane or staff— though notably, still not a deadly weapon (Les documents épistolaires du palais de Mari [3 vols.; LAPO 16-18; Paris: Cerf, 1997-], 3:322-23, no. 1144). Jack M. Sasson identifies it as a wrestling belt ("Reflections on an Unusual Practice Reported in ARM X4", Or 43 [1974]: 404-10). The gist of the text in either case is that Zimri-Lim will overpower his opponent as they "grapple" and that this is then translated to military victory. 12 A third type of fighting, neither athletic nor military precisely, is succession combat. How ever, these contests were planned, armed, and fought to the death. See Joseph Fontenrose, The Ritual Ritual Theory of Myth (University of California Folklore Studies 18; Berkeley: University of Cal ifornia Press, 1971), 41-49. 13 Westermann, Genesis, 2:518; Walter Brueggemann, Genesis (IBC; Atlanta: John Knox, 1982), 269. For most, there is no question as to the victor. See, e.g., Gunkel, Genesis, 349; E. A. Speiser, Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (3rd éd.; AB 1; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1979), 256; and Roland Barthes, "La lutte avec l'ange", in idem et al., Analyse structurale et exégèse biblique:biblique: Essais d'interprétation (Bibliothèque théologique; Neuchâtel: Delachaux et Niestlé, 1972), 32. 14 This is extremely unusual. Consider for instance the Ugaritic texts, in which deities always prevail in combat against humans (e.g., Anat's victory over two towns full of young men in the Baal cycle) and have trouble only when matched with one other, as in the struggle between Baal and Mot.</page><page sequence="7">Hamori:Hamori: Echoes of Gilgamesh in the Jacob Story 631 only this conclusion: "Gilgamesh knelt, his foot on the ground, his rage calmed, he turned away" (P 227-30). The confusion comes from the fact that kneeling has the potential to signify either victory or defeat. Thorkild Jacobsen, for example, under stands this to be the indication that Gilgamesh loses the fight.15 Gilgamesh is not brought to his knees, however. Rather, he himself knelt (ikmisma, G preterite) on one knee with the other foot on the ground (ina qaqqari sëpsu). While the text does not depict a formal athletic competition, it should be noted that the very stance described is found in Greek portrayals of victorious athletes. One vase, for exam pie, bears two paintings of an athletic victor; in both pictures the athlete, adorned with victors wreath and palm, is kneeling on one knee with the opposite foot on the ground.16 A Near Eastern seal image shows a victorious hero in a similar stance, holding a lion over his head as he kneels on one knee, with the opposite foot on the ground.17 Gilgamesh cannot be construed as having fallen to his knees. On the con trary, "Gilgamesh knelt, his foot on the ground," in what perfectly matches this vie tory stance.18 The final outcome of the match is shared by the two texts as well. In each case the victor is blessed by his attacker. It should be noted immediately that this is not a usual context for a blessing. As Westermann has observed, this is in fact the only place in the Tanakh in which a blessing is acquired through a struggle.19 Further more, the two blessings are similar in both form and content. Jacobs attacker declares: "Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have striven with God and with human beings, and have prevailed" (Gen 32:28). This can be divided 15 Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness: A History of Mesopotamian Religion (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), 199; and idem, "The Gilgamesh Epic: Tragic and Romantic Vision," in Lingering over Words: Studies in Ancient Near Eastern Literature in Honor of William L. Moran (ed. Tzvi Abusch, John Huehnergard, and Piotr Steinkeller; HSS 37; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990), 237. 16 Harold A. Harris, Greek Athletes and Athletics (London: Hutchinson, 1964), 128, plate 32. 17 British Museum Photo BM 89140, cited by Benjamin R. Foster, who translates, "It was Gil gamesh who knelt for the pin" (The Epic of Gilgamesh: A New Translation, Analogues, Criticism [New York: Norton, 2001], 16-17, illustration 2). For further discussion of such comparisons, see George, Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, 1:191-92. 18 Even in formal Greek wrestling, being brought to the knees did not constitute defeat. A match was generally lost through a fall. See Michael Poliakoff, Combat Sports in the Ancient World: Competition,Competition, Violence, and Culture (Sport and History Series; New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987), 23-25; Harold A. Harris, Greek Athletics and the Jews (ed. I. M. Barton and A. J. Brothers; Trivium: Special Publications 3; Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1976), 67; E. Norman Gardiner, Athletics Athletics of the Ancient World (Oxford: Clarendon, 1930), 181-83. There is also artistic evidence that a wrestler could continue to fight even from both knees, such as vases and statues depicting wrestlers grappling on their knees. See, e.g., Poliakoff, 47-49, illustrations 42-47; and Gardiner, 188, illustrations 156-57. 19 Westermann, Genesis, 2:518.</page><page sequence="8">632 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 4 (2011) into two parts. First, the divine opponent makes a declaration regarding the iden titytity and legacy of Jacob in relation to God; second, he affirms that Jacob has pre vailed over all others. Enkidus blessing of victorious Gilgamesh follows the same pattern: "As one unique your mother bore you, the wild cow of the sheep-folds, Ninsunna! Your head is extolled above men; kingship of the people Enlil has decreed for you" (P 234-39). Again, the first statement is in regard to the identity and legacy of Gilgamesh in relation to his mother, the goddess; the second state ment affirms that Gilgamesh prevails over all others. In both cases, the force of the blessing is clear: the hero will continue to prevail as the divinely appointed father or leader of his people.20 II. Parallels in the Surrounding Material In addition to the many shared elements of the two wrestling scenes in par ticular, the larger narratives of these stories also share several unusual features, specifically in regard to the depiction of other main characters. Taken by them selves, these additional similarities would not demonstrate a relationship between the two stories. In light of the close connection between the two wrestling scenes, however, the correspondences between the depictions of key characters in the sur rounding stories are noteworthy. It is possible that the authors use of the cluster of details from Gilgamesh and Enkidus wrestling match could have served as a hook, bringing along secondarily other themes from the surrounding narrative. It is also possible that there already existed some degree of similarity between key charac ters in the two larger stories, and that the process was one of further assimilation.21 While the two stories are clearly very different overall, the portrayals of and relationships between the main characters are oddly parallel. The most significant correspondence at this level involves the principal human conflict of the Jacob cycle, that of Jacob and Esau. In Genesis, of course, the hero's primary rival and his wrestling opponent are not the same character. This is a crucial distinction, and its significance will be taken up later. In the interests of comparison to a broader lit erary phenomenon, it should be noted that the occurrence of character splitting— in which one character in one story is reflected in two separate characters in a later story—is known from transmission of folklore.22 The fact that the portrayals of 20 In addition to his role as father of the people, Jacob's function as the leader of his people is seen in Isaacs original blessing, "Peoples will serve you, and nations will bow down to you" (Gen 32:29). 21 See esp. Yair Zakovitch, "Assimilation in Biblical Narratives," in Empirical Models for Bib licallical Criticism (ed. Jeffrey H. Tigay; Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985), 175-96. 22 Max Luthi, Das Volksmarchen als Dichtung: Àsthetik und Anthropologie (Studien zur Volkserzâhlung 1; Dtisseldorf: E. Diederichs, 1975), 85.</page><page sequence="9">Hamori:Hamori: Echoes of Gilgamesh in the Jacob Story 633 Esau and of Jacobs wrestling partner both reflect shades of Enkidu is not so strange in storytelling terms, but it is surprising and intriguing and will in fact reveal the particular interests of the Israelite text. The hero in each story is described in contrast to his primary rival. Jacob is comfortable dwelling in tents, while Esau is a wild man, at home in the fields. The portrait of Gilgamesh too is that of a civilized man, drawn in contrast to his wild opponent, who lives among the animals. Jacob is "smooth" (חלק), described in con trast to Esau, who is hairy (שער) (Gen 27:11). Our hero Gilgamesh too is fair in appearance (isaru zïmûsu), unlike Enkidu, who is hairy. The two hairy counter parts are described using cognate terms, שער and su^urum.23 The initial descrip tion of Esau states that "all of him was like a garment of hair" (כלו כאדרת שער) (Gen 25:25; cf. 27:11), and in the Pennsylvania tablet, before the wrestling scene, the barber tends to Enkidus entire hairy body (su^urum pagarsu) (P 106). Similarly, in the SBV portrayal of Enkidu, "his whole body was bushy with hair" (I 105).24 The picture of Esau is just as extreme: when Jacob seeks to fool his father into tak ing him for Esau, he dresses in animal skins in order to be hairy enough to compare! Yet, in spite of this conspicuous difference between the hero and his oppo nent in the two stories, they are created to be a pair. Jacob and Esau are of course twins. Enkidu is created to be a match for Gilgamesh, whom Gilgamesh would love like a spouse (P 33). The portrayal of an animal-like man is not in itself uncommon. Gregory Mobley has observed many examples of the individual "wild man" in biblical texts, including Adam, Nimrod, Ishmael, Esau, Elijah, and Samson.25 While it is inter esting to note this motif in its various forms, this range of characters should demon strate that the portrayal of Esau goes beyond that of a common type. He is as hairy as the animals that surround him in the fields and is the counterpart of smooth Jacob at home in his tent. The theme of a civilized and uncivilized pair is also not unique. Mobley points to Ishmael and Isaac as an example of this.26 Even if one accepts this idea, here too 23 This has been observed before; see Speiser, Genesis, 196; Ronald S. Hendel, The Epic of the Patriarch:Patriarch: The Jacob Cycle and the Narrative Traditions of Canaan and Israel (HSM 42; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1987), 117. 24 In the SBV, Gilgamesh and Enkidu are each said to have a healthy head of hair, in virtu ally identical language (160; 1107); however, the lines preceding these refer respectively to the hair on Gilgamesh's cheeks, and the hair covering Enkidu's entire body (I 59; I 105). 25 Mobley, "The Wild Man in the Bible and the Ancient Near East," JBL 116 (1997); 226-27. Mobley offers examples of the "wild man" type in medieval, biblical, and Near Eastern literature but does not aim to compare them to one another. Others have suggested general similarities in "type," such as Ronald A. Veenker, who writes that "Enkidu represents primal or original man much like Adam in the Bible" ("Syro-Mesopotamia: The Old Babylonian Period," in Chavalas and Younger, Mesopotamia and the Bible, 165-66). 26 Mobley, "Wild Man," 226.</page><page sequence="10">634 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 4 (2011) the portrayal of Jacob and Esau clearly goes further: they are twins, smooth and hairy, indoor and outdoor, born together but destined from the womb to be opposed. As Mobley says of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Enkidu is the "feral double, the Doppelgànger, of the hero Gilgamesh."27 This would also describe Esau and his twin Jacob well. The depiction of Jacob and Esau is not merely a vague picture of a civilized and uncivilized pair; if anything, the suggestion of Isaac and Ishmael as such a pair should highlight how much closer the depiction of Jacob and Esau is to that of Gilgamesh and Enkidu. Jacob and Esau have been compared to other pairings as well. Ronald Hendels work on Jacob and Esau cautiously using the classic Levi-Straussian nature-culture polarity includes discussion of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Horus and Seth, and Hypsouranios and Ousôos.28 Hendel is careful not to reduce the characters to a "type," noting that his goal is instead "to highlight one strand in the complex web of traditions that encompasses, to a greater or lesser degree, each of these figures."29 The comparison I am making between Jacob and Esau and Gilgamesh and Enkidu does not rest on seeing a "type" of wild man, or even a pair rooted in broader tra dition. Rather, it is based on recognition of a very specific expression of a smooth hero and his hairy Doppelgànger. In comparison to examples such as Adam, Isaac and Ishmael, or Horus and Seth, it once again becomes evident that the depiction of Jacob and Esau bears an especially close resemblance to that of Gilgamesh and Enkidu. An additional shared theme in the larger narrative of the two stories may be observed in particularities of the hero-mother relationship. In the stories of Jacob and Gilgamesh, each hero receives essential counsel from his mother, a wise woman with divine insight. Rebekah inquires of Yahweh before the birth of her children and he tells her of their future.30 Knowing their destiny, she guides Jacob accordingly. This is noteworthy here because Rebekah is the only mother in the Hebrew Bible described as engaging in this type of activity. The mother of Moses, for example, acts instrumentally regarding his future in Exodus 2 but is apparently unaware of the significance of her actions. Naomi and Ruth, both mothers whose actions affect the line of David, are equally unwitting. Even Hannah, whose story centers on her praying, does not share this quality; it is Eli the priest who speaks to her on behalf 27 Ibid., 223. 28 Hendel uses these comparisons to offer insight into the function of men associated with wilderness in Israelite literature, such as Esau, Ishmael, and Cain (Epic of the Patriarch, 111-31). 29 Ibid., 122. 30 The verb דרש used of Rebekahs activity in Gen 25:22 is used regularly of "prophets" inquiring of God (e.g., 1 Kgs 22:8; 2 Kgs 3:11; 8:8; 22:13; Jer 21:2; Ezek20:l, 3) and of "mediums," "spiritists," and so on inquiring of ghosts, spirits, and foreign gods (e.g., Deut 18:11; 1 Sam 28:7; 2 Kgs 1:2, 3, 6, 16; Isa 8:19; 19:3; Ezek 14:10).</page><page sequence="11">Hamori:Hamori: Echoes ofGilgamesh in the Jacob Story 635 of God. Miriam the prophet is not said to be a mother, and Deborah, who is renowned as a prophet and is instrumental in a phase of Israelite history, is not a mother; nor is Huldah the prophet in 2 Kings 22 and 2 Chronicles 34.31 Notably, these prophets are among the few female characters in the Hebrew Bible who are not said to bear children. The only woman who is called a prophet and bears a child is the unnamed woman in Isa 8:3, who has the title נביאה but does not in the story receive any word from God.32 Furthermore, this type of "inquiring" throughout the Hebrew Bible generally involves the work of an intermediary, whether a prophet, a medium, or another diviner. It is unusual that Rebekah "inquires" of God without an intermediary. In this way as well, the unique divinatory nature of her activity in relation to her son cannot be regarded as standard or incidental. Gilgamesh's mother Ninsunna also has divine insight, not merely because she is herself a goddess but also because she too engages in divinatory activity on her sons behalf. Before Gilgamesh meets Enkidu, he is disturbed by strange dreams and relates them to his mother. She inter prêts the dreams for her son, each time introduced as "the mother of Gilgamesh, knowing everything" (P 15; 37). Both mothers, then, through their divinatory activ ity, gain privileged knowledge regarding the nature of the relationship between the hero and his primary rival, as Rebekah inquires of Yahweh while the twins are struggling in her womb, and Ninsunna interprets her sons dreams regarding the approach of Enkidu. As it happens, this is not the first time it has been suggested that Gilgamesh's two key relationships—that with Enkidu and that with his mother—have influ enced another story. Jack M. Sasson, in a discussion of the influence of Gilgamesh on other texts, notes that T. B. L. Webster "demonstrated the possible dependence in the conception of Achilles and Patroclus upon the model of Gilgamesh and Enkidu," observing that "the protagonists of each epic would become unthinkable without their respective mothers and companions."33 31 Deborah is referred to in Judg 5:7 as "a mother in Israel," but the term is used metaphor ically. See Susan Ackerman, Warrior, Dancer, Seductress, Queen: Women in Judges and Biblical Israel Israel (ABRL; New York: Doubleday, 1998), 38-44. The fourth and last named female prophet is Noadiah, who is also not said to be a mother and who appears in only one verse (Neh 6:14). 32 Esther J. Hamori, "Childless Female Diviners in the Bible and Beyond," in Prophets Male and and Female: Gender and Prophecy in the Hebrew Bible, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Ancient Near Near East (ed. C.

The primary parallels directly related to the wrestling scene include the nighttime attack by an unknown opponent who is either divine or divinely created for this purpose, spontaneous unarmed combat with no intent to fight to the death, the victory of the attacked hero who is somehow appeased, and the blessing given by the opponent, who is known to the hero only at the end of the encounter. These parallels are not arbitrary but in fact touch every part of the basic conflict. Moreover, these events occur in the same sequence in the two stories. The parallels related to the larger narrative include the theme of rivalry between the smooth or fair man and the hairy man, who embody the tension between civilized and uncivilized but are created to be a pair, as well as the theme of the mother who divines knowledge of the relationship between the pair. As suggested above, it is possible that these elements of the surrounding nar rative trailed along as the Israelite author utilized the familiar framework of the Gilgamesh wrestling story. It also possible that a settled/steppe pairing (as in the portrayal of Isaac and Ishmael) was already present in the Jacob story and inspired the use of the Gilgamesh narrative. In either case, it should be noted that the primary and secondary parallels shown above are not scattered haphazardly throughout the whole Jacob cycle, through stories of Jacob, Laban, and Syria, through Priestly and non-Priestly texts. On the contrary, they are all contained in the non-Priestly stories of Jacob and Esau and their mother Rebekah, all of which take place outside of Syria.34 That is, the bib lical parallels to Gilgamesh happen neither in a single pericope nor throughout the entire Jacob story but specifically on the level of the Jacob-Esau-Rebekah cycle. III. Implications The presence of any single motif shared by two stories is not extraordinary; for example, tales of wild hairy men are known from many parts of the world. Even the presence of any single highly unusual theme shared by two stories, such as spon taneous unarmed combat with no intention to fight to the death, might be inter esting but would not constitute evidence of direct influence. It is the shared grouping of multiple motifs that are both independently unusual and have no inherent connection to one another that should raise suspicion of a shared tradi tion. There is no intrinsic link, for example, between the themes of nonlethal unarmed combat, an unknown nocturnal attacker (even while the hero is known 34 On the relationships between various parts of the Priestly and non-Priestly Jacob cycle, see David M. Carr, Reading the Fractures of Genesis: Historical and Literary Approaches (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1996), 265-71.</page><page sequence="13">Hamori:Hamori: Echoes ofGilgamesh in the Jacob Story 637 to him), and the attackers blessing of the hero rather than a traditional end to the fight, not to mention the themes of tension between the civilized and uncivilized expressed in the antagonism between a smooth individual and a hairy one, and the mother who divines knowledge of their relationship. However, the two stories in which we find this shared series of unusual themes are clearly very different. The story of Jacob is about the ongoing process of defin ing Israelite identity, which is obviously unrelated to Gilgamesh. Yet it would appear that the writer of the Jacob story at a certain point utilizes the framework familiar from Gilgamesh to tell a portion of his story. What must be explored, then, is how the use of this framework might have served his purpose. The broader context of the wrestling match in Genesis is the story of Jacob and Esau.35 Jacob has stolen his brothers birthright and finally usurps his blessing. Upon hearing of this, Esau is enraged and vows to kill Jacob, who flees for his life to Haran, where he remains for a good many years. It is on his fearful return to Canaan that Jacob wrestles God. The immediate context of the wrestling scene fur ther establishes that it is linked to the Esau story. The surrounding material forms the story of Jacobs fear of and reconciliation to Esau. Immediately beforehand, Jacob is afraid for his life, expecting an attack by Esau, and sends ahead gifts to pacify his old rival. He then wrestles his opponent. Directly after the fight, Jacob offers his gifts to Esau in person and is reconciled to him. Why, then, should the wrestling match occur between the two halves of the story of the reconciliation of Jacob and Esau? To be sure, the placement of the scene shows literary brilliance—the nocturnal supernatural terror following the realistic daytime fear is shocking to the reader—but there is a message that goes beyond the literary effect. The story of Jacob and Esau is the story of Israel and Edom. It is Edom who originally has the birthright, the inheritance, the blessing. When Jacob (or Israel) returns to Canaan, he asks God to uphold his blessing and his claim on the land. It is at this point in the story that the author utilizes the framework famil iar from Gilgamesh to tell the story of Jacobs struggle and the confirmation of his blessing. But the author does so in the most unexpected way: a fight does ensue, though not the one anticipated. It is of course not Esau whom Jacob wrestles but God. We should be surprised that this bout is not with Esau.36 The immediately 35 On various types of links between the wrestling story and the surrounding material regarding the brothers, see, e.g., Horst Seebass, Genesis (3 vols.; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirch ener Verlag, 1996-2000), 2:399-401; Gordon J. Wenham, Genesis 16-50 (WBC 2; Dallas: Word, 1994), 294; and Mark S. Smith, "Remembering God: Collective Memory in Israelite Religion," CBQCBQ 64 (2002): 643-44. 36 For a later interpretation showing a tradition of physical conflict between Jacob and Esau, see the commentary on Gen 33:4 in Gen. Rab. 78:9: the brothers meet in tears, but instead of falling on Jacob's neck and kissing him (וישקהו), Esau tries to bite Jacob's neck (נשך &lt; נשק). In one</page><page sequence="14">638 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 4 (2011) surrounding material is concerned with the central conflict of the Jacob story, that of Jacob and Esau. We see the expectation of their combat immediately preceding the wrestling match and their reconciliation directly afterward. Why, then, does Jacob wrestle with God and not Esau? The presence of God rather than Esau in the crucial scene is significant in the story of Israel and Edom in several ways. First, a central element in this story is that of the blessing. Jacobs blessing, however, cannot very well come from Esau. It is God who chooses Israel, not Edom. Until this point in the story, Jacob had done his utmost to secure the blessing first given to Edom, but his finagling had backfired to the point of endangering his life. It is in fact only in his dread of Esau as he returns to Canaan that he finally asks God to uphold the blessing he received through deceit. The blessing of Israel and the gift of the inheritance were at first stolen from Edom by Rebekah and Jacob. The confirmation of that bless ing, then, must come not from Esau, or from Edom, who had first rights, but from God. Second, already in the first story about the brothers in Gen 25:30 we are told that Esau is called Edom. Jacob is not called Israel, however, until his attacker blesses him. Once again, it is significant that this attacker is unexpectedly God, and not Esau. It must be God who identifies and first proclaims the name of Israel, not Edom. Third, in the Gilgamesh story the fight paves the way for a sustained rela tionship between the hero and his attacker. We do in fact see the struggle between Jacob and his brother give way to a sustained relationship immediately after the fight scene. It is central to the author of the Jacob story, however, that, while Jacobs primary conflict has been with Esau, or Edom, who originally had the blessing and the inheritance, and while reconciliation between these two is achieved directly following the wrestling match, the sustained bond gained by the fight is not between Israel and Edom but between Israel and God. Thus, we see not only that the author has utilized the Gilgamesh framework at this point in the story, and that the placement of the story connects it to the story of Jacob and Esau's rivalry, but also that the presence of God in the story rather than Esau is crucial. The author tells the story of the conflict over Edom's original right to the blessing (the story of Jacobs struggle and reconciliation with Esau), and demonstrates that Israels name and blessing, his inheritance, and his claim on the land, come from God, not from Edom. Likewise, Jacob's sustained bond after the fight is with God, not Edom. charming version of this, Jacob's neck becomes like marble, which further explains the reasons for the brothers' tears. Jacob weeps because Esau has tried to bite him; Esau weeps because his teeth have been knocked out.</page><page sequence="15">Hamori:Hamori: Echoes of Gilgamesh in the Jacob Story 639 This then begins to address how use of the Gilgamesh framework serves the author of the Jacob story. Through both the use and placement of the familiar framework, both Esau and Jacob's wrestling opponent are evocative of Enkidu's role in Gilgamesh. This incidence of character splitting does not seem to be a fluke: the tight connection between Esau and the divine attacker highlights the emphasis on the role of God over against Edom, as delineated above. We should note that Esau and the wrestler are also linked in the text at the verbal level. Jacob says to his attacker, "I have seen [ראיתי] God face to face, and my life has been delivered" (Gen 32:31), and to Esau, "I see [ראיתי] your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably" (33:10). The wrestling scene is also framed by an anticipation of this, as Jacob says upon sending gifts to Esau, "afterward I will see his face" (Gen 32:21; Eng. 32:20). The author thus links the expected attacker, Esau, to the actual attacker, God, in a manner that draws par ticular attention to the fact that, after the enduring struggle surrounding Edoms original right to the blessing, the one who names Jacob Israel and confirms the promise that he will inherit the land is God, not Edom. The biblical author seems to have found a model for a good fight—that is, a productive fight, in which the hero and the opponent not only both survive but are even bonded through the experience, a fight involving not enemies, but between friends and partners. My purpose here has been to demonstrate the likely influence of Gilgamesh primarily on the Jacob wrestling scene, and secondarily on the Jacob-Esau Rebekah cycle. I do not intend to identify a particular date at which the Gilgamesh framework would have been brought into the Israelite material. It should be noted, however, that there is no realistic date for such composition/redaction at which Gilgamesh would not have been known. In other words, this argument regarding use of Gilgamesh does not rest on any one theory of dating. Gilgamesh was known in Canaan, as is clear from the fourteenth-century Megiddo tablet (MB Megiddo), which Andrew George notes is "likely to be the descendant of an Old Babylonian recension."37 Other Middle Babylonian Gil gamesh tablets from the west include those found at Ugarit, Emar, and Bogazkôy. The Middle Babylonian Ugaritic version, interestingly, includes elements known from the OB, but is quite its own composition.38 Of the two versions found at Bogazkôy, MB Bog! (fifteenth or fourteenth century) is very close at points to the OB Pennsylvania and Yale tablets, and Bog2 (thirteenth century) seems to be a par aphrase, with both a dream scene closely matching an OB text and otherwise 37 George, Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, 1:343; see 1:339-47 for introduction, text, translation, and notes. 38 Daniel Arnaud, Corpus des textes de bibliothèque de Ras Shamra-Ougarit (1936-2000) en sumérien,sumérien, babylonien et assyrien (Aula orientalis supplementa 23; Sabadell-Barcelona: Ausa, 2007), 130-33; Andrew George, "The Gilgamesh Epic at Ugarit," AuOr 25 (2007): 237-54.</page><page sequence="16">640 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 4 (2011) unknown material. For both this tablet and MB Megiddo, George concludes a lengthy process of transmission in the west.39 As he observes, to illustrate the spread of Gilgamesh to the west and the flowering of adaptations, "the story so caught the imagination that versions of it were composed in local languages," that is, Hittite and Hurrian.40 Beyond the specific evidence of knowledge of Gilgamesh in the West in pre Israelite times, George offers a useful summary of the overwhelming popularity of Gilgamesh in scribal training and the broader culture, and the complex interplay of oral and written that we must assume for the transmission of Gilgamesh (as we see in compositions across the Near East and the Levant).41 This last point is impor tant because, as stated at the outset, we are not to assume that the author of the Jacob story was reading a Gilgamesh tablet. It would defy logic and common sense to assume that the story of Gilgamesh was unknown between the dates of the various textual attestations that have been established. From the pre-Israelite Megiddo tablet at one end of the spectrum to the much later influence of OB Gilgamesh on Qohelet at the other end, there is no rea son to posit a time during the span of biblical composition when stories of Gilgamesh would have been unknown.42 Additionally, while there should be no assumption of an Israelite author working from a set text of one precise version, it is noteworthy that both of these ends of the spectrum reflect the OB Gilgamesh tradition. Thus, although an Israelite context for the composition/redaction of the Jacob-Esau-Jacob-Esau-Rebekah cycle may make the most sense, the present argument for the influence of the familiar framework of Gilgamesh on this material is not depend ent on any one model for the dating of the Genesis texts. How, then, may we envision the accessibility of Gilgamesh to the Israelite author? It is known that Gilgamesh had a literary life in the west in the Middle Bronze Age, and was popular in scribal practice. It is unlikely, however, that Gilgamesh would have been copied in cuneiform in the region after this, since 59 George, Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, 1:25-26. 40 Ibid., 1:24. 41 On the popularity of Gilgamesh in scribal practice and broader culture, see George, Baby Ionian Ionian Gilgamesh Epic, 1:33-39; on the oral and written in Gilgamesh, 1:54-57. On the interplay of the oral and the written in ancient Israelite scribal practice in particular, see David M. Carr, Writing Writing on the Tablet of the Heart: Origins of Scripture and Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press,Press, 2005), esp. 111-73. 42 On the influence of OB Gilgamesh on Qohelet, see Oswald Loretz, Qohelet und der alte Orient:Orient: Untersuchungen zu Stil und theologischer Thematik des Bûches Qohelet (Freiburg: Herder, 1964), 116-22; also John Day, "Foreign Semitic Influence on the Wisdom of Israel and Its Appro priation in the Book of Proverbs," in Wisdom in Ancient Israel: Essays in Honour of J. A. Emerton (ed. John Day, Robert P. Gordon, and H. G. M. Williamson; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 59-61.</page><page sequence="17">Hamori:Hamori: Echoes of Gilgamesh in the Jacob Story 641 cuneiform was much more widely known in Middle Bronze Age Canaan than in the Iron Age.43 There are then two possibilities: either the Gilgamesh story continued to be known in the west orally, taking unknown forms, with its themes perhaps fil tering through Canaanite and later Israelite storytelling, or the influence on the Jacob story came from texts of Gilgamesh as known through Israelite scribal con tact in the Assyrian or Babylonian period. Given that the correspondences we see between the two stories are on the level of unexpected clusters of themes and details, but not linguistic parallels, it is more likely the former. One might compare this in a general sense to the flood story, which does not show verbal parallels or other linguistic evidence of direct copying but, in its clusters of themes and details, certainly reveals the influence of the Mesopotamian story, even with its many pro nounced and quite intentional differences. Sasson has remarked that "direct borrowing of Gilgameshian motifs are, understandably, exceedingly difficult to identify in the Bible." He suggests that Jacobs blessing of Simeon and Levi in Gen 49:5-6 might "preserve a memory" of tales of Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven: "Simeon and Levi are a pair / Their weapons are tools of lawlessness / Let not my person be included in their council / Let not my being be counted in their assembly. / For in anger, they slew a man / and in their delight, they maimed a bull."44 Others have of course pointed to the flood story as a place of direct or indirect influence, though this is made more com plicated by the fact that the story was not native to the Gilgamesh Epic and the theme itself is by no means unusual.45 The case at hand seems more consciously contrived than a memory in a poetic couplet, and the parallels are more complex than those between the flood stories. As we have seen, the wrestling stories and surrounding material share approxi mately a dozen highly unusual themes in as many lines, with key elements occur ring in the same sequence, and we cannot brush this off by vaguely attributing the same combination of uncommon unrelated motifs to common folklore. I suggest that the author of the Jacob story shaped his narrative so that the precise echoes of the story of Gilgamesh should throw emphasis on the ideologically essential point where he diverges from it: the point where Jacob wrestles with God, instead of with Esau, as both the plot and the Gilgamesh motifs would lead us to expect. The dra matically powerful reassigning of Enkidu motifs to two characters—Esau and 43 Wayne Horowitz and Takayoshi Oshima, Cuneiform in Canaan: Cuneiform Sources from the the Land of Israel in Ancient Times (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2006), 10-19; Karel van der Toorn, "Cuneiform Documents from Syria-Palestine: Texts, Scribes, and Schools," ZDPV116 (2000): 97-113. 44 Sasson, "Some Literary Motifs," 275. 45 On the incorporation of the flood story into the Gilgamesh Epic, see Tigay, Evolution of the Gilgamesh Epic, 214-40.</page><page sequence="18">642 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 4 (2011) God—is a narrative decision that, as I believe, requires an author and will not allow us to posit instead a series of haphazard accretions, changes, and conflations result ing in the Jacob story as it stands. As I have said, existing Israelite traditions (per haps about the hairy wild brother, perhaps also about the trickster-hero's fight with a divine being) may have sparked the author's inspiration to draw on the Gilgamesh story. It is also possible that once our author had done his work other narrators drew even tighter the net of associations with the Gilgamesh story. These uncer tainties about what happened before and after our author's work do not affect my argument. The argument presented here accounts for the parallels between Gilgamesh and the Jacob story that cannot be explained by casual reference to the ubiquity of folkloric motifs, and gives a more compelling account of the placement of the wrestling episode than is offered by the view that it is, so to speak, a foreign body in the story of Jacob and Esau.</page></plain_text>
