Noriaki Okada, National Aerospace Lab . The Upper Surface Blowing STOL experimental aircraft ASKA, was developed and flight tested by the National Aerospace Labora- tory of Japan. The ASKA operated well on the backside of the drag curve, and because of this flight path control was accomplished with the throttle lever (thrust) during approach and landing. To compen- sate for the sluggish flight path response caused by the thrust response lag, the flight path control law put in stability and control augmentation system. Flight tests were conducted to evaluate flight path and airspeed response characteristics. This paper describes ASKA' s flight path and airspeed response characteristics, as well as construction of the flight path control system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940003. (P-272) Technology requirements for the next gener- ation SST. Takashi Uchida and Hiroshi Mizuno, Japan Aircraft Development Corp. The next generation SST is recognized that environmental and economical issues must be satisfied concurrently. In this paper, what are required, what and how should be done to satisfy these issues are discussed. Especially, emphasis is put on economical viability of the SST. Key technologies for the SST realization are on drag reduction, composite material structure, quiet and low NOx emission variable cycle engine, low cost development and high maintainability aircraft design. As a result of technology feasibility study, it is found that drag reduction technology is very important and especially, low speed aerodynamics is essential for environmental and economical issues. Required technology improvement to realize the SST is more than 20% for aerodynamic efficiency. 940004. (P-272) Ultra-low-maintenance nickel-cadmium bat- tery development program. Fred-Eric Hapiak , SAFT. Saft introduces a new range of Ultra Low Maintenance Nickel- Cadmium batteries for aircraft. Product designs for select military and civil aircraft have been developed, qualified by independent official labs and flight tested during 1992 and 1993. This improved battery product line named Ultra Low Maintenance or ULM features on most applications drastically extended maintenance free periods and interchangeability with current products while being more pow- erful and lighter weight. 940006. (P-272) A PC-based interpreting software for ATLAS language and IBM- AT compatible PC-based ATE. Mar Siew Cheong, Nanyang Technological Univ. Most of the present day automatic testing equipment (ATE) of avionics systems are designed for dedicated applications. Hardware components and sub-systems together with the associated operating software are usually not interchangeable with systems supplied by different vendors and results in high maintenance cost using these ATEs. This article reports on an ATE which was developed using a gen- eral IBM-AT compatible personal computer as the main controller and ATLAS as the operating software. The developed prototype has the advantage of having a portable software and can be used in any system that communicates through the general purpose interface bus (GPIB). 940007. (P-272) On board maintenance systems - The ulti- mate solution. Philippe Mazeau, Sextant Avionique. Avionics is assuming an increasingly important role in modern aircraft. Avionics functions are more and more complex and critical to aircraft safety and performance. Against this background, avion- ics maintenance deserves special attention since the ability to detect and diagnose avionics faults has become a major issue. Maintenance of all modern airplanes relies on built-in test Equip- ment (BITE). Ideally BITE should report accurate and confident information permitting quick isolation of failures. Unfortunately, BITE is not infallible and this expected goal has not been reached. Many of the reasons explaining BITE unreliability have been identi- fied and have solutions that can make a significant contribution toward a usable on-board maintenance system. 940008. (P-272) Repair of trailing edge of C1023 NGVs by a gouge-and-braze technique. L. C. Lim, S. Sivashanker, and S. K. Tung, National University of Singapore. A gouge-and-braze technique has been investigated as an alterna- tive to repair cracks sustained at the trailing edges of CI 023 nozzle guide vanes. Slots of four different widths, namely, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 mm, were gouged at the trailing edge, either by a low-speed dia- mond-impregnated saw or by electro-discharge machining (EDM), to simulate the crack gouging process. The slots were then blasted with glass beads, SiC particles or nickel powder. Then, they were pre-packed with braze mixes, with an excess of braze mixes depos- ited on top of the slots, and brazed in vacuum at high temperature. A few slots were also similarly brazed but in the as-gouged condi- tions. The results show that the as-saw cut slots can be brazed read- ily but it is not so for the as-EDM slots. Blasting by blass beads, SiC particles or nickel powder is effective in improving the wetting char- acteristics of slot surfaces. The results further show that slots wider than 0.3 mm can only be successfully brazed with braze mixes con- taining 30 to 50% of gap filler. The advantages and limitations of using filler metal alone instead of braze mixes as excess filler deposit on top of the slots are also investigated. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940011. (P-272) H infinite-control model of the human pilot based on Neal- Smith criterion. Norihiro Goto, Kunihiro Chatani, and Satoshi Fujita, Kyushu Univ. The Neal-Smith criterion for handling qualities analysis of highly augmented aircraft is rewritten in terms of H infinite norms. The pitch attitude control is solved in the framework of an H infinite problem by the model matching technique to yield H infinite-control pilot models. The obtained H infinite closed- loop transfer function satisfies the Neal-Smith criterion quite well, and the required pilot compensation is clearly exhibited in the H infinite-control pilot model. Surveying all the flight configurations in the work by Neal and Smith, an attempt is made at pursuing the pilot compensation indices that correlate well with pilot ratings. 940012. (P-272) A preliminary evaluation test of GPS/DGPS navigation system. Takatsugu Ono, Kazutoshi Ishikawa, Yoshikazu Miyazawa, and Masaaki Murata, National Aerospace Lab. The National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) has been conducting basic research on the future landing navigation system of airplanes and a proposed future unmanned reentry space vehicle, using NAL research airplane Dornier Do-228 in which a Collins NAVCORE- I GPS C/A receiver was installed. A ground-to-air data link system was developed in order to realize the real time DGPS operation which improves accuracy. In this paper, experimental evaluation test results of not only GPS stand-alone operation but also DGPS opera- tion are discussed. Since the navigation algorithm in the NAV- CORE- 1 receiver could not be modified, this paper mainly discusses the difference of the two operations. In fixed point ground test, ground and onboard GPS receivers were connected to the same antenna in order to avoid common errors, and both receivers output positions were compared with a reference map position. In the flight tests, approach/landing flights were conducted. Do-228 was tracked during flight by a laser tracker, which provides subsequent data on a reference aircraft's position. Onboard GPS receiver output position data was compared to the laser tracker data. 3</page><page sequence="3">940012-940022 From these test results, it was experimentally shown that SA error, which is added to degrade the positioning accuracy of civilian GPS users and is the largest error source, was eliminated by the DGPS operation technique. In addition, the quantitative position accuracy data of GPS/DGPS was obtained. 940013. (P-272) In-flight simulator evaluation of a flight ref- erence display for powered-lift STOL aircraft Keiji Tanaka, National Aerospace lab.; and Kohei Funabiki, Yushi Terni , and Toshiharu Inagaki, National Aerospace Lab. A new flight reference display for powered-lift STOL aircraft was proposed and evaluated in actual flight environment. The dis- play was developed to provide a simple monitoring system of STOL safety margins with good handling characteristics in place of speed indicator. Using this display, pilots repeated simulated approaches of the experimental jet STOL 4 'AŠĶA' ' using the VSRA as an inflight simulator. In the evaluation, emphasis was placed on agree- ment between the display and the motion cues experienced by the pilot. Pilot comments and flight data confirmed satisfactory control characteristics and safety margin presentation of the display. 940016. (P-272) Autonomous spacecraft navigation and ren- dezvous using GPS. Lynn S. Diamant, Loral Space Information Systems. This paper summarizes the development of a Kaiman combining algorithm, the derivation of a GPS selection technique and the results of analyzing 12 cases in demonstrating the accuracy of using GPS, totally independent of ground-based equipment, in determin- ing the relative state of two vehicles during rendezvous. The results show expected-error values ranging from 1 meter and .001 meter/ sec to 24 meters and 3.1 meters/sec. The technique is sensitive to antennae offsets (unknown), GPS selection availability and gravity gradient modeling. It is less sensitive to filter initial values than expected. Most interestingly, the relative state errors are signifi- cantly less than the individual errors in the two spacecraft absolute states and that the technique is virtually immune to refraction and relativistic effects. 940017. (P-272) Numerical simulation of blade-vortex inter- action in two- dimensional viscous flow. Bonian Dong, Yong-Tian Chew, and Boo-Cheong Khoo, National University of Singapore ; and Dean T. Mook, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. A numerical approach based on a finite element method has been developed to simulate the two-dimensional blade- vortex interaction in viscous flows. In the scheme, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the vorticity-stream form are used. When the passing vortex is approaching the airfoil from upstream, two different mod- els for the vortex are used. Firstly, the vortex is modeled as an invis- cid vortex convecting at the speed of the local fluid, and the total flow is the superposition of the vortex-induced flow and the viscous flow. Secondly, when the vortex is close to the airfoil, it is distrib- uted in a weighted manner at the nodes of the element where it is located, and then the total flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. Some numerical results are presented, and the potential of the present work is discussed. 940018. (P-272) Visualization of fluid motions in parallelo- grammic enclosures with varying gravitational fields. T. S. Lee, National University of Singapore. Numerical flow visualization was made on air contained in parel- lelogrammic thermal enclosures under various angles of gravita- tional fields for enclosure aspect ratio of 3.0. Rayleigh numbers con- sidered are in the range of 103 to 106. The gravitational fields act on the enclosures in angels varying from 0° to 360° in steps of 15°. For air with a Prandtl number of 0.7, a transition in the mode of fluid circulation was observed when the gravitational field is varied and the mean Nusselt changed from maximum to minimum. Flow visu- alization experiments were made for air with Pr=0.7 at Ra^XlO3 with aspect ratios of the order &gt; 1 . 940019. (P-272) Computer and experimental simulation of fluid flow through varying-constricted tubes. T. S. Lee and H. T. Low, National University of Singapore. Flow fields in the neighborhood of constrictions in a tube were studied numerically. Flow separation and reattachment as the flow passes through the constrictions in the tube were studied for Reyn- olds number to the order of 200. Constrictions with constriction spacing ratios of 1, 2, 3 and infinite were studied for diameter con- striction ratios of 0.2 and 0.6. Experimental flow visualizations were performed for similar double constrictions. 940020. (P-272) Computational flow visualization of mixed fluid motions in the annuii of heated rotating mercury slip- rings. T. S. Lee, National University of Singapore. A computational flow visualization study was made on the mixed fluid motions and thermal patterns of liquid mercury (Pr=0.02) con- tained within a horizontal slip ring annular region of radius ratio 2.6. Visualizations show that the liquid mercury were found to have points of maximum and minimum thermal plumes at the interior nodes, instead of the top and bottom nodes which is known for the air (Pr=0.7). For liquid mercury, when the inner cylinder is made to rotate the thermal plume moves in a direction opposite to that of the rotation of the inner cylinder. This thermal plume movement is opposite to that observed for the high Prandtl number fluid flow where the mono-thermal plume on top of the inner cylinder moves in the same direction as the inner rotating cylinder. 940021. (P-272) Software application in airline operations - Back to basics. Voon Yih Meng, Loong Kwan Chean Donnell, and Mervyn Sirisena, Singapore Airlines. As we move toward the 21st century, new demands and require- ments on the airline industry will continue to dictate the introduction of many new systems, designs and concepts on the airplanes. In line with these developments, there will also be extensive use of soft- ware given its potential, flexibility and benefits. Software represents an important aspect of a systems operation - often, processing infor- mation, calculating, monitoring, deciding and giving instructions to be carried out. A successful application will be beneficial to the airplane and the airline's operation. On the other hand, the improper and uncon- trolled usage of software will lead to adverse effects. Consequently, it is important to draw from the present accumulated experience and apply lessons learned from in-service operations to avoid any unde- sirable consequences, and to ensure a profitable application. 940022. (P-272) The GE90 - Designing for maintainability. F. R. Szecskay, General Electric Aircraft Engines. The purpose of this paper is to describe and illustrate how design- ing for maintainability in modern ultra high bypass ratio turbofan jet engines has significant cost advantages for both the airline opera- tor and the engine manufacturer. It is also necessary to include in the process of designing for maintainability innovations which opti- mize the airline's ability to utilize engine assets in the most cost effective manner. Contemporary jet engine design evolved to the degree that major engine functional units could be disassembled without disturbing adjacent units to facilitate maintenance in the engine shop, the familiar modular maintenance concept. This was innovative when developed in the early 1970' s but today's 80,000 pound thrust class engines require new initiatives. The significance of designing for maintainability lies in the changing technical attitudes which now recognize that a specific and disciplined process needs to be put in place to acknowledge and understand the 4 'previous design process" short comings relative to reliability impact either directly or indirectly caused by poor or neg- ligent maintainability ergonomics. 4</page><page sequence="4">940022-940030 All of the above factors led to organizing a methodical approach based on previous experience of the CF6 and CFM56 engines regarding the design development of the all new GE90 ultra high bypass ratio turbofan engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940024. (P-272) Use of free time during long-duration space missions. Nick Kanas, University of California. During future long-duration space missions, crewmembers will be subjected to periods of free time which may be monotonous and hypostimulating. Ground-based studies and Russian space missions have shown that dysphoria and interpersonal tension can occur dur- ing these times, and our survey of 54 astronauts and cosmonauts suggests that long-duration space travelers value access to media that can be used to occupy free time. Activities should be individual- ized, capable of privacy, and flexible enough to account for chang- ing preferences. Important media include audio and video cassettes, news teleprinters, books, two-way televisions, games, and hobby and professional supplies. During long-duration manned space missions, crewmembers are subjected to intervals of time which are monotonous and relatively low in sensory stimulation. In past missions, dysphoria and interper- sonal tension have been observed during these periods of free time which have negatively affected crew morale and interfered with the efficient achievement of operational and scientific goals. For this reason, it is important that planning for future long term missions should take into account the need for free time activities that can stimulate and engage crewmembers in positive ways. This will help prevent the psychological and interpersonal problems that can result from conditions of low stimulation and can lead to decrements in performance and unfulfilled mission goals. 940025. (P-272) Projecting human systems requirements for new aeronautical systems. R. Bruce Gould, Edward Boyle, H. Bar- bara Sorensen, and David A. Dahn, U.S. Air Force Armstrong Lab. Technological advancements in aeronautical systems have not been matched by improvements in the way human system require- ments (HSR) are taken into account during the development pro- cess. As a result, HSR accounts for increasing proportions of the life cycle costs of aeronautical systems - 40 to 66 percent in the case of the U.S. Air Force. Effective HSR analysis tools do not exist but this paper presents two emerging technologies which are focused on giving aeronautical system planners, designers, and developers the ability to integrate HSR tradeoffs into the development process and decrease the cost of ownership while maintaining system perfor- mance requirements. 940026. (P-272) Human systems advance technology - A-team. H. Barbara Sorensen, U.S. Air Force Armstrong Lab. The automated-training, evaluation, acquisition, and manage- ment (A-TEAM) program is a U.S. joint service management initia- tive to provide a standardized, integrated set of training develop- ment tools to support and sustain military training requirements. The A-TEAM is sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and has a prime mission to establish commonality, capability, and interoperability in the defense department for advanced training sys- tems development and implementation. The A-TEAM system development evaluates approaches for integrating service-specific automated training development tools. These tools are being cross- service and industry tested. The initial training development tools selected for the A-TEAM evaluation and integration include: 1) joint service instructional sys- tems development/logistic support analysis record decision support system from the U.S. Air Force; 2) authoring instructional material (AIM) from the U.S. Navy; and 3) automated systems approach to training from the U.S. Army. Several other systems that will be eval- uated to support the A- TEAM integration effort include the U.S. Marine Corps automated information management (MC AIM) sys- tem and the U.S. Air Force advanced training system (ATS). 940027. (P-272) Human systems advanced technology - Advanced training systems development. Bettina A. Babbitt, Nor- throp Corp.; H. Barbara Sorensen, U.S. Air Force Armstrong Lab.; S. A. Metalis, Northrop Corp.; Richard Obermayer and Frederick A. Muckler, VRC Corp.; and Sallie Gordon, University of Idaho. The shift toward information intensive, technically sophisticated, military missions will have major implications for current and future training systems which will be developed and implemented under greater budget constraints than previous systems. New methodolo- gies such as Instructional Systems Development (ISD) Decision Aiding Models; Cognitive Conceptual Representation for Decision Making, and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (a form of expert system) hold promise to reduce instructional development time, reduce manpower requirements, and improve methodologies to train higher levels of cognitive skill complexity. The Advanced Training Systems Development project has five main objectives. One, will apply the methods of cognitive science to behavioral research designed to better understand how pilots plan and conduct air combat missions. This application will result in a prototype ITS for pilot training of air intercept radar tracking and intercept geometry. The second representation of an air-combat engagement with a simulated mission. The third objective will pro- vide a report of differences in knowledge and decision making between more and less experienced pilots in air-combat engage- ments. An evaluation of expert system shells and intelligent tutoring systems with demonstrations of pilot tasks on an intelligent tutoring system will impact the fourth objective. The final objective will be completed by the design, and development, and testing of a Joint Service Instructional Systems Development/Aircrew training Deci- sion Support System. 940028. (P-272) Nonlinear analysis of flight dynamics at large angles of attack and sideslip. Gerard Leng, National University of Singapore. Results from nonlinear dynamical systems theory are used in understanding fighter aircraft flight dynamics at large angles of attack and sideslip. Instabilities encountered at large angles of attack and sideslip like pitch-up, nose-slice, wing-rock are readily exam- ined within the context of bifurcation theory. An example of nonlin- ear analysis using a reduced order model and a combined symbolic/ numeric computational approach is discussed. It will be shown that dynamical systems theory provides useful guidelines for flight sim- ulation and testing at large angles of attack and sideslip. 940029. (P-272) Application of GDQ scheme to solve incom- pressible Navier- Stokes equations in the curvilinear coordinate system. C. Shu and Y. T. Chew, National University of Singapore. In this paper, a global method of generalized differential quadra- ture (GDQ) is applied to solve the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the curvilinear coordinate system. The vorticity-stream function formulation was used. Numerical results for a smooth expansion channel flow demonstrated that accurate numerical results can be obtained using a considerably small num- ber of grid points. 940030. (P-272) Calculation of hypersonic turbulent flows using the parabolized Navier-Stokes equations. C. Shu, K. S. Yeo, and B. C. Khoo, National University of Singapore. In the present work, the Osher-Chakravarthy's upwind scheme with Roe's Riemann solver is applied to solve the three- dimen- sional, turbulent, parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) equations. The governing equations are discretized by a finite volume approach, and the turbulence closure for the Reynolds stress is obtained by using an algebraic turbulence model of Baldwin-Lomax. The pres- ent PNS solver can be used for marching the solution downstream from a given initial data surface and also for generating the starting solution. Along each plane in the marching direction, the resultant algebraic equation system was solved by strongly implicit procedure (SIP). Application of present solver to a test problem showed that 5</page><page sequence="5">940030-940042 the present numerical results agree well with the experimental data and other numerical results. 940031. (P-272) Computational study of aerodynamic flows inside nozzles. B. Ramakrishnananda and M. Damodaran, Nany- ang Technological Univ. Compressible aerodynamic flows inside nozzles are computed by a finite volume method to numerically integrate the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The solution procedure is based on an explicit multi-stage time-stepping scheme wherein the spatial terms are central-differenced and a combination of second and fourth dif- ferences in the flow variables are used to construct numerical dissi- pation terms to enhance numerical stability. Convergence to steady state is accelerated dramatically by using local time-stepping, implicit residual smoothing and a multi-grid strategy. Computed results are presented for a wide variety of flow regimes comprising of subsonic, transonic, choked and supersonic flows for a nozzle. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940033. (P-272) The numerical simulation of 3-D viscous compressible flow for modern aircraft turbine components. E. Y-K. Ng, Nanyang Technological Univ. The present work described a method for performing detailed computations of Navier-Stokes equations in turbomachinery appli- cation. The time-marching strategy developed is a modified form of the basic beam-warming implicit algorithm using the concept of novel "pre-processed" approach to solve the equations of the 3-D Reynolds averaged N-S equations with a mixing length turbulence model in finite volume form and in the blade-relative frame using cylindrical coordinates and with appropriate source terms to permit the solution to be obtained in a rotating cylindrical coordinate sys- tem. Time steps are not severely limited when mesh points are finely distributed. Computational efficiency and compatibility to vector- ized computer processors is maintained by use of approximate fac- torization techniques. An outline of the scheme is addressed and the present capabilities of the solver are assessed. Numerical results are reported for a high speed low-pressure modern gas turbine blade and show good agreement with other workers measurements. The over- all accuracy of the predictions is most severely limited by turbulence model, particularly transition modelling. 940034. (P-272) Numerical and experimental study of drag characteristics of HLFC airfoils in high subsonic, high reynolds number flows. Yoji Ishida, Masayoshi Noguchi, Mamoru Sato, and Hiroshi Kanda, National Aerospace Lab. Hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) is one of the most practi- cally promising aircraft drag reduction technologies. We have inves- tigated both numerically and experimentally aerodynamic character- istics of HLFC airfoil and wing at high subsonic, high Reynolds number conditions. In this paper we report the result of a wind tun- nel test on drag characteristics of two-dimensional HLFC airfoils with porous and slot suction approach under some adverse factors against laminar flow, and a numerical analysis of the wind tunnel data, which is based on the boundary layer calculation with new transition prediction method allowed for the adverse factors and the Squire-Young drag formula. 940036. (P-272) Manpower, personnel, and training analysis in aerospace system development. David A. Dahn and H. Barbara Sorensen, U.S. Air Force Armstrong Lab. The manpower, personnel, and training (MPT) in acquisition decision support system (DSS) is an Air Force program providing the first integrated tool for addressing MPT requirements during system acquisition and design. New weapon system development and major modifications have historically neglected how our most important and costly resource - people - will maintain and support the fielded system. Inadequate planning for training and deploying the human element has often delayed system operational dates. The DSS will assist acquisition managers and analysts to effectively integrate people issues (numbers, characteristics, proficiency) with equipment (aircraft) early in the acquisition cycle. Acquisition spe- cialists can use the structured analysis approach provided by the MPT DSS to ensure that system people costs are affordable, jobs are properly structured, and people are trained prior to the system becoming operational. The MPT DSS is being designed to support the human system integration requirements, now directed under DOD Instruction 5000.2. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940038. (P-272) Control of flexible structures - An instanta- neous optimal control approach. S han- M in Swei, Taiwan Techni- cal Consultants, Inc.; Chih-Chen Chang, Hong-Kong Univ.; and Ti- Tsann Jiang, Purdue Univ. An application of instantaneous optimal control algorithm using the Newmark integration scheme to flexible structures is presented. The proposed control design procedure involves only a few simple algebraic manipulations, and this differs from the Riccati equation approach in which one needs to solve a large dimension of eigenval- ue/eigenvector problem. However, in the proposed approach the closed-loop stability is not always guaranteed, as opposed to the classical optimal control problem in which the "performance" guarantees the closed-loop stability. In this paper, we propose a sys- tematic way of choosing and characterizing the weighting matrices so that the closed-loop stability is ensured. We use an example of a flexible plane truss structure subjected to an impact to illustrate our results. 940041. (P-272) Aeroacoustic analysis of transonic helicopter rotor noise. Shigeru Saito and Takashi Aoyama, National Aero- space Lab.; and Keiji Kawachi and Junichi Kamio, University of Tokyo. The viscous effect on the high-speed impulsive (HSI) noise for a helicopter rotor has been investigated by using a combined method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques with the extended Kirchhoff s equation. The pressure distributions around a rotor blade are obtained by Euler and Navier-Stokes equations to capture a precise shock behavior. The Kirchhoff s equation extended to a moving surface is applied to calculate the acoustic pressures at the observer point. In this calculation, the pressures and pressure gradients on the Kirch- hoff surface, in which all the acoustic sources are enclosed, are obtained by using CFD techniques. In order to estimate the effect of the viscosity on the acoustic pressures, two types of turbulence model in Navier-Stokes calculations are used. One is Baldwin- Lomax model and the other is Coakley's q - w model. The HSI noise of a non-lifting hovering rotor is calculated by using the present method, and the reasonable correlation between calculated and experimental results are obtained. The effect of the viscosity on the acoustic signature showed slight difference after the derealization occurred on the rotor blade. On the other hand, there is little difference on the acoustic signature before the derealiza- tion. 940042. (P-272) Estimation of the wing lift distribution of the STOL experimental aircraft, "ASKA". Hamaki Inokuchi, National Aerospace Lab. We estimated the wing lift distribution from the ASKA's flight test, utilizing the stress data of the wing and the horizontal tail fin. The wing lift distribution was estimated, by dividing the wing into three kinds of parts; the center wing part, the USB (Upper Surface Blowing) flap parts, and the outer wing parts. The results are that the lift of the center wing part is relatively high in all configurations. Particularly, it is higher than the lift of the USB flap parts in the STOL take off configuration and in the clean configuration. 6</page><page sequence="6">940042-940057 The induced drag of a USB type powered lift STOL aircraft was calculated from the estimates of the wing lift distribution. The results were compared with an aerodynamics model drag estimated by flight test data. 940043. (P-272) Design of gas turbine controller. Q. Song , Nanyang Technological Univ. This paper describes the design of gas turbine controllers based on working line control strategy, starting from the engine test mod- eling and then discusses the engine simulation results obtained with the control system. Emphasis has been placed on the fixed discrete- time and adaptive control strategies, including parameter and neural adaptive controllers. Simulation results are presented to show the advantage of the proposed scheme. 940047. (P-272) Continuing airworthiness challenges. Ulf G. Goranson and Jack F. McGuire, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Structural safety is an evolutionary accomplishment, and atten- tion to detail design features is key to its achievement. A multitude of design considerations is involved in ensuring the structural integ- rity of Boeing jet transports that have common design concepts vali- dated by extensive analyses, tests, and three decades of service. The active service life of commercial airplanes has increased in recent years as a result of increasing costs for fleet replacements. As air- planes approach their design service objectives, the incidences of fatigue and corrosion may become widespread. Continuing airwor- thiness of the aging jet fleet requires diligent performance from the manufacturer, the airlines, and airworthiness authorities. This paper gives an overview of traditional Boeing maintenance- related activities, joint industry/airworthiness authority initiatives, and the anticipated benefits for future generations of commercial airplanes. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940052. (P-272) A mode of laser propulsion - Axi-symmetric laser-supported detonation. To s hi Fujiwara, Toshihide Fukui, and Futoshi Yonezawa, Nagoya Univ. Expecting that the laser propulsion is one of the most interesting next-generation space propulsion systems, it is important to analyze the mechanism of LSD (Laser-Supported Detonation) waves caused by laser absorption. The performance of laser propulsion is deter- mined mainly by the laser absorption efficiency. We find that four physico-chemical processes take place in a LSD wave: 1) laser energy is absorbed by free electrons through inverse bremsstrah- lung; 2) this energy is distributed to heavy particles (atoms and ions) through elastic and 3) inelastic collisions, and 4) although it is partly lost as radiation emission by bremsstrahlung. We simulate this LSD wave, using 1-D and axisymmetric 3-D models, and considering CO2 and CO lasers. Then we clarify the mechanism of LSD wave. Rapid radiation and ionization processes impose stiffness problems to the numerical analysis. To remove the stiffness, we have used a modified Harten- Yee-type TVD scheme which takes account of real gas effects. 940053. (P-272) Chemical removal of ceramic thermal bar- rier and metallic bond coats from gas turbine combustion com- ponents. Thomas W. B leeks, Enlhone-OMl Inc.; and Glen H. Gra- ham, Tinker Air Force Base. This paper describes a chemical immersion process capable of removing ceramic thermal barrier coatings, high temperature oxida- tion resistant coatings, and, nickel-aluminide bond coat materials from gas turbine engine components typically found in commercial and military jet engines. This process was originally developed to remove thermal barrier coatings from JT-8D combustion chambers for commercial aircraft. Since then, the process has been utilized to remove a variety of MCrAIY coatings from commercial and mili- tary aircraft engines. 940054. (P-272) Plasma spray processing of titanium alumi- nides. K. A. Khor, Nanyang Technological Univ. TÍ3AI (a2) and TiAl (gamma) are of technological importance to aerospace-type applications due to their attractive high temperature properties. Plasma spraying of fine powder and coatings of Titanium aluminides was carried out to examine the effect of spray parameters on the microstructure and properties of these materials. Character- ization of the powders and coatings was performed using the scan- ning electron microscope (SEM) and image analyzer. The results show that while plasma spraying is a viable process for forming coatings and fine powders of Ti- Al, the initial particle size of the powder feedstock and the plasma gas composition play an important role in successful processing of the material. 940055. (P-272) Aluminium lithium (Al-Li) - silicon carbide (SiC) composities by powder metallurgy (PM) route. K. A. Khor, Nanyang Technoligical Univ.; F. Boey, Nanyang Technological Univ.; and T. Sano, AIST, MITI. Aluminium-lithium (Al-Li) alloys have gained prominence in the aerospace industry in recent years as structural materials. This is due primarily to their mechanical properties, such as high specific strength and modulus, and low density. Development of Al-Li/ceramic composites is currently being investigated to enhance the higher service capabilities of this mate- rial. Processing of Al-Li/ceramic composites by the powder metal- lurgy (PM) route offers many advantages over ingot casting such as a well-dispersed reinforcement distribution and easy handling. However, the PM route suffers from agglomeration of the ceramic reinforcement when the particle size is below 2.5 pm. This paper reports the development of several methods of mixing submicron ceramic powders with Al-Li to obtain a uniform distribu- tion of the reinforcement. Among the methods used were mixing in a fluidized bed, ball milling, spray drying and mixing the metal powder with a ceramic slurry. The results showed that the methods employed in ceramic processing such as the uses of deflocculants are important to the success of mixing the submicron ceramics to Al-Li. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940056. (P-272) Material systems for solar sails. Yakov Belopolsky, E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. The use of the solar sail cargo spacecraft in a manned mission to Mars can provide inexpensive means to deliver large payloads in different planetary regions. This paper deals with requirements for material systems for solar sails. Systems based on polyamide and polyester dielectrics were analyzed. Several metallization approaches were experimentally verified. An optimal ratio of the overall metal thickness to the intensity of UV radiation was calcu- lated. This paper provides solar-sail-as- payload calculations for the existing spacecraft design. Using computer finite element analyses, electronic microscopy and experimental procedures, the mechanical stresses and forces were investigated. 940057. (P-272) Erosion behavior of stitched composite lami- nates. Pearl Lee-Sullivan and Guoxing Lu, Nanyang Technological Univ. The sand-water erosion behavior of notched holes in glass/epoxy composites was investigated. Using through-the- thickness stitch- ing, the amount of hole damage caused by impact testing prior to wear tests was varied. Erosion resistance was evaluated based on the amount of mass loss. Results showed that the holes in unstitched laminate which incurred greatest impact damage, eroded the least. The holes in stitched laminates, however were more susceptible to erosive wear even though the internal damage appeared less severe. SEM photographs showed that the lower half of the holes in the uns- titched laminates remained intact while those in the stitched lami- nates were eroded substantially. Cut sections away from the hole were observed with a optical microscope. A comparison of cut sec- tions showed that heavy stitching results in severe fibre impalement 7</page><page sequence="7">940057-940064 damage, thereby reducing the reinforcing capability of the fibers around the hole. For the unstitched composite, in spite of more widespread delamination damage, the inherent presence of protrud- ing fibers in the backplies provided additional resistance against ero- sion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940058. (P-272) Delamination suppression in composites via thermoplastic interleaves. L. Li, P. Lee-Sullivan, and K. M. Liew, Nanyang Technological Univ. The paper presents the development of delamination resistant composite laminates using interleaving technology. A simple tech- nique which incorporates discrete layers of thin thermoplastic films between wet glass/epoxy prepreg, followed by co-curing, is described. Two types of films having widely different properties were used in order to investigate the effects of film characteristics on composite intelaminar shear strength. Microscopic observations of the specimens after four- point shear testing showed that the fail- ure mode was strongly affected by both the presence and the charac- teristics of the interleaves. 940059. (P-272) Hybrid stabilization techniques for sub- integrated finite elements. K. Y. Sze, University of Singapore. It has been know for years that sub-integrated elements are more efficient and accurate than the fully integrated elements. For con- ventional formulation of constrained problems, reduced integration is even a necessity for removal of lockings. Unfortunately, the spuri- ous mechanisms of the sub-integrated elements may give rise to sin- gular assembled stiffness matrices and thus plague practical engi- neering analyses. Even if the spurious mechanisms are suppressed by the displacement boundary conditions, unexpected oscillations of the predicted field quantities may be observed. In the past decades, a large amount of effort has been spent on developing stabilization scheme for sub-integrated elements. In this paper, a brief review would be given on stabilization. A special version of hybrid stabili- zation based on the admissible matrix formulation would be pres- ented. Sample elements and their numerical examples are given. 940061. (P-272) The latest progress in the computational aerodynamic system for practical aircraft configurations. Susumu Takanaski, National Aerospace Lab.; and Masami Take- moto, Sanko, Ltd. An aerodynamic simulation system for practical aircraft configu- rations has been developed. The outline of the system is first described, and then its recent progress is presented especially for a grid generation as well as a newly introduced parallel vector com- puter at the National Aerospace Laboratory, Japan.

(P-272) Development of a proposed international standard for certification of aircraft to high intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Noel B. Sargent, NASA Lewis Research Center. Avionic systems performing critical functions in modern aircraft are potentially susceptible to the hazards of electromagnetic radia- tion from ground and airborne transmitters. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requested that the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) coordinate the development of procedures and guidance material which can be used during the aircraft certification process to ensure adequate protection against High Intensity Radi- ated Fields (HIRF). This paper addresses the technical challenge of drafting a certification procedure and guidance standard, and the management process used by the SAE subcommittee AE4R to con- verge a diverse range of opinions by its international membership in the shortest possible time. 940063. (P-272) A methodology for eliminating the use of ozone-depleting solvents in aircraft maintenance. Michael Zatz, ICF Inc.; and Pakasit Chanvinij, Thai Airways International Ltd. The mandates of the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer are having a significant impact on operations at aircraft maintenance facilities worldwide. The impending phase- out of the use of the two most prevalent cleaning solvents - CFC- 113 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane - requires engineers at these facilities to identify and evaluate potential alternatives to the use of these sub- stances in all applications. While airlines in many developed coun- tries are well on their way to completing their elimination of ozone- depleting solvents, some of the smaller airlines, as well as those in less developed countries, may not have access to sufficient informa- tion about alternative processes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, in coopera- tion with the Industry Cooperative for Ozone Layer Protection, Thai Airways International, and the Government of Thailand, have pre- pared a technical manual designed to aid airlines in their phaseout efforts. The manual, titled "Eliminating CFC-1 13 and Methyl Chlo- roform in Aircraft Maintenance Procedures," provides general information on the alternatives themselves, and presents an overall strategy for identifying and evaluating alternatives. 940064. (P-272) Process-oriented human factors in manufac- turing. Sherrill A. Walker, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Boeing Wichita hired their first human factors professional in the early fifties. For over thirty years, the work in the area of human fac- tors maintained a traditional focus, concentrating on product usabil- ity. Their work was to build the customer's human specifications into the product design. This customer focus centered on building a product that would be easier to use and maintain. In the late seven- ties and early eighties, manufacturing found itself faced with a re- emphasized need to increase productivity to stay in business. To meet this demand, companies began implementing new technology modernization programs, causing the workplace to be in a state of rapid change. These changes called for a new approach in the way companies planned for new technology and in how they utilized their human factors. During this time, Boeing Wichita applied a human factors approach to planning new technology implementation. Employees from the existing Crew Systems organization were directed to staff a new group and build a human factors plan for implementing new technology into the manufacturing environment. This new group departed from the traditional product orientation and took on a pro- cess orientation. Our objective was to apply research data and les- sons learned from past experience to the jobs of people involved in the manufacturing work. The time was right to assist the assembly mechanic in building the plane. At that time, we did not realize that we were on the cutting edge of the application of human factors in American manufacturing. Armed with a small staff and a huge amount of enthusiasm, we began tackling the problems of imple- menting new technology into the workplace. Over the next ten years (1980-1990), with the advent of Occupa- tional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) emphasis on ergo- nomics, and the new Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, the emphasis and work mix of the Human Factors and Ergo- nomie Development organization changed. Global competition, the struggle to remain a world class company, and emerging OSHA and ADA regulations contributed to the increased need for Human Fac- tors' involvement in the design, evaluation and recommendation of new and improved processes for manufacturing. Not only were we concerned with building a better airplane, but building the airplane better. In addition to the human factors work on new technology, this organization is now involved in recommending improvements to existing manufacturing processes, working with the Safety orga- nization to prevent injuries, performing job and task analyses for the return-to-work program, recommending reasonable accommoda- tions under the Americans with Disabilities act, and working on continuous quality improvement teams and design-build teams for new product development. This paper will discuss the evolution of Human Factors' involvement in manufacturing at Boeing Wichita. Discussion will cover how the organization was started, what type 8</page><page sequence="8">940064-940084 of work is performed, how it is done and some recent accomplish- ments. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 940075. (P-273) Improvement of the cold start qualities of diesel engines with swirl chambers. H. Mohr and A. Urlaub , Insti- tut für Verbrennungskraftmaschinen und Flugtriebwerke. A spark ignition was adapted to a passenger-car-type diesel engine with swirl chambers. This should improve the cold start qual- ities, which are sometimes insufficient because of the long ignition delays. Now there were no problems with the cold start. The engine start happened rapidly and the engine run was very smooth. Other advan- tages could be found, too. E.g. the HC-emissions of the warm engine start could be decreased significantly. The energy consumption was only 10% of the standard glow plugs and it is possible to decrease the compression ratio of the engine. 940076. (P-273) Decreasing energy expenditures for warming engines before ignition. Leonid Reznik, Tyumen Industrial Insti- tute ; and Vladimir Karnaukhov, Technological Transport Manage- ment. Efficiency of electrical power use for engines preheating under winter conditions is determined by heater capacity and its operating regime as well as intershift storage conditions and engines adapt- ability towards these conditions. This paper presents heater capacity determination method as well as operating regime that have been worked by the authors. This method is based upon regularities that explain the engine tempera- tures change process. This presented method provides a guidance for power consump- tion reduction. 940078. (P-273) Effects of gas leakage and crevices on cold starting of engines. V. K. Rao , D. P. Gardiner , and M. F. Bardon, Royal Military College. The temperature and pressure of the charge, reached at the end of the compression stroke when an engine is cranked for starting, decide whether it will start and attain self-sustained running. These, in turn, are affected by the crevice volume in, and the blowby from, the engine, particularly at the cold ambient temperatures and low cranking speeds. This paper presents a model to estimate these effects. Tentative values are proposed for the parameters that appear in the model based on experiments performed on small engines motored in a cold chamber. The model can be incorporated in engine cycle simulation programs to allow for crevice and blowby effects. 940080. (P-273) Pre-oiling system during cold-start of IS engine. Matti Parpóla and Petri Satosuo, Helsinki Institute of Tech- nology. Cold-startability of a modern Si-engine is no longer a problem, thanks to advanced fuel injection and ignition systems as well as engine pre-heaters. However, the engine lubrication does not work as required before the oil pressure has been built up at even the far- most end of the lube system. In subzero conditions down to -30°C this means the engine may run 30 .. 70 seconds after turning the igni- tion key without the camshaft and valve mechanism receiving suffi- cient lubrication. Daily cold-starts in very low ambient temperatures may be critical to the engine life, especially if the lubricant has not been chosen carefully. By using a pre-oiling device generating pressure in the main oil gallery before starting, the lubrication delay can be significantly shortened if the lubricant is a mineral oil. However, the pre-oiling also needs preheating. 940081. (P-273) New diesel low temperature operability test AGELFI filtration test. Dominique, M. Hamon, Bernard, Y. Damin, and Philippe N. China, ELF ANTAR France. Low temperature operability of winter grade fuels is a major con- cern for users, car manufacturers and refiners. The cold filter plugging point (CFPP) has been widely used as an indication of the low temperature operability. With the new engine technologies and the new trends to improve the cold flow properties of diesel fuels, it was shown that the CFPP test is no longer a reliable predictor of vehicle operability, hence, requiring a new test. The AGELFI test has been developed with conditions very close to those encountered in the field (nature and size of the filter, pres- sure...). The equipment is composed of four measuring posts totally independent to each other. It is cooled by a cryostat and completely computer monitored. Extensive tests on a wide range of European Diesel fuels show a very good correlation with the operability values measured on cold chassis dynamometers, on different vehicles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940082. (P-273) Experimental and numerical investigations of deicing and anti- icing fluid performances under various pre- cipitation conditions. Patrick Louchez, Jean-Louis Laforte, and Gilles Bouchard, Université du Québec á Chicoutimi. Recognition of the need for safe ground aircraft anti-icing prod- ucts with extended holdover times, and awareness of the related take-off perturbations, have been steadily growing during the 1980's. Standard laboratory testing procedures have been estab- lished by regulators to assess both holdover and aerodynamic per- formances of the commercial anti-icing fluids to be used on airports. Unfortunately, the standard laboratory evaluation procedures do not cover all the conditions encountered in natural cold precipitations which, at times, can vary with respect to the limited conditions sim- ulated in laboratory. Therefore, a research work, on this subject, has been undertaken at the Université du Québec á Chicoutimi (UQAC) with the main objective of identifying the response of deicing and anti-icing fluids under a wide range of icing conditions. Since laboratory constraints are limiting the capability of repro- ducing all types of natural icing events, various numerical simula- tions were developed to study the freezing process of a de/antiicing fluid. These simulations address two situations of the fluid behavior: the state of almost rest on an inclined plate, and the state of high shearing during take-off. To complement this effort, laboratory experimentations were also performed, where icing parameters were varied to increase available data, especially in terms of precipitation rate. This paper intends to present the results derived from the numerical simulations developed under this research program in relation to the experimental data obtained in icing simulations. 940083. (P-273) Cold start automotive research efforts at the University of Alaska Anchorage. David C. Junge, University of Alaska Anchorage. Cold start automobile tests were conducted at the University of Alaska Anchorage to determine the effectiveness of engine block preheaters in reducing emissions of carbon monoxide. The tests were conducted under no-load idle conditions. Sixteen vehicles were tested. The test results indicate that significant reductions in CO emis- sions can be achieved during cold start when engine block prehe- aters are used. Additional tests were conducted to determine if the use of engine block preheaters under cold temperature starting conditions would result in fuel savings. The test results indicate that fuel consumption is not influenced by the use engine block preheaters. 940084. (P-273) A development methodology for improving the cold start performance of spark ignition engines. P. J. Shayler, P. R. Tinwell, and J. Dixon, University of Nottingham; and D. Eade, Ford Motor Co. 9</page><page sequence="9">940084-940094 Optimising an engine specification to improve cold start perfor- mance has been investigated. Taguchi methods were used to define a test program to assess the effect of seven build factors. Experi- ments were conducted to measure mixture ratio at the spark plug location after a short period of engine cranking at test conditions covering +15°C and three fuel-mass- supplied values. The analysis of the results identified build modifications which improved start quality and reduced HC and CO emissions substantially compared to a reference, base-line build. Injector design and location, and inlet valve timing were found to have most influence on robustness to uncontrolled variations in mixture preparation during starts. 940085. (P-273) Computer aided evaluation of cold start fuel- ling strategy and calibration details for spark ignition engines. P. J. Shay 1er, J. D. Sage, and J. Dixon, University of Nottingham; and D. Eade, Ford Motor Co. Spark ignition engines for automotive applications must have good cold start performance characteristics at sub-zero ambient tem- peratures. Satisfactory performance is most difficult to achieve at the lower end of the temperature range, typically around -30°C. The start characteristics of a particular engine depend on basic design features, starter motor characteristics, and the calibration and strat- egy used to regulate fuel supply during start up. The paper reports a computational model which enables the investigation of these with the minimum of experimental data. The model has been developed to run on a desk-top PC machine, specifically as a CAE develop- ment tool. The formulation of the model and the experimental tests were used to generate the input data required for particular applica- tions are described. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940086. (P-273) Diesel engine cold starting with catalytically ignited recirculated exhaust gas. Ruonan Sun, E. Jack Sweet, J. R. Zurio, and William C. Pfefferie, Precision Combustion, Inc. A system using catalytically ignited recirculated exhaust gas (EGR) has been shown to be capable of starting a heavy-duty diesel engine at temperatures as low as -31.6°C (-25°F) within one minute cranking following US Army Cold Start procedure 2-2-650. A Cum- mins 6-cylinder C8.3 automotive diesel engine was provided with an EGR pipe fitted with a catalytic ignitor/burner. During starting, the catalyst was kept above the activation temperature by a low power electric power supply. With this system, the unburned fuel in the EGR gas was rapidly ignited by and partially oxidized within the catalytic ignitor/burner, and then mixed with the fresh air before being inducted into the cylinders. The elevated inlet charge tempera- tures increased the compression temperature, thus promoting autoignition and therefore engine starting. Comparisons were made between starting attempts with and without using catalytically ignited EGR. Pilot fuel additions to the catalytic ignitor/burner on starting were also investigated and found to allow starting well below -31.6°C (-25°F). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940088. (P-273) The development of a temperature compen- sated gas lift cylinder. Mark A. Popjoy and Alan L. Weaver, Sta- bilus. A new method of temperature compensation for gas lift cylinders has been developed which results in improved operating characteris- tics by using a thermal switch activated poppet valve. This allows the use of lighter weight lift cylinders, which have a more consistent handle load over the operating temperature range; with subsequent increased flexibility for applications. 940089. (P-273) Improvements in heater, defroster and emis- sions performances using a latent heat storage device. Anestis P. Tsantis, J. Steven Brown, Robert J. Hutter, and Peter M. Lyon, Ford Motor Co.; and T. Singh, Wayne State Univ. Here we present a latent heat storage device which is used to pro- vide "quick/supplemental" heat to the vehicle's conventional heat- ing system. First, we present data from actual in-vehicle cold weather tests. Data are presented for heater and defroster perfor- mance tests, emissions tests and cold start tests after extended soaks. Secondly, heater performance predictions are made using a com- puter simulation program. Finally, the actual heater performance results are compared with the computer simulation. 940090. (P-273) Design and evaluation of a towed snow plow for the small unit support vehicle (SUSV). Paul W. Richmond and Michael R. Walsh, U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineer- ing Lab. Light Infantry Divisions must conduct semiautonomous opera- tions and limited self-resupply in remote snow covered areas. Most wheeled vehicles become immobilized once the vehicle sinkage is greater than their ground clearance. Since many roads and trails will not have been kept open prior to deployment, truckmounted plows will be ineffective for clearing snow. In most instances, heavy tracked vehicles, which may not be available, are required to plow snow. Therefore a snow removal method using vehicles readily available to light forces is needed. The US Army's Small Unit Support Vehicle (SUSV) is a light- weight, low-ground-pressure tracked vehicle. A towed V-type plow assembly was proposed for this vehicle. A four-bar parallel linkage towing assembly was developed that bolts directly on to the SUSV' s pintle hook mounting bracket. The plow was constructed primarily of aluminum, has three plowing widths, and can be towed over the road on integral wheels. This paper presents a description of the design and operation of the plow along with the results of field tests conducted in Alaska. The SUSV successfully towed the plow through 85 cm of unbonded snow. 940092. (P-273) New information on the differences between studded and unstudded tires. Timo Mäkelä, Test World Oy; Mariti Merilinna, Tekniikan Maailma Magazine; and Jukka Antila, Test World Oy. There are always factors of uncertainty in tire testing which may, at worst, lead to incorrect conclusions. Acknowledging and control- ling these factors is an essential part of tire studies. One factor of uncertainty in investigations of studded tires is stud protrusion. If changes in stud protrusion are not controlled in the course of the test, this will inevitably lead to incorrect evaluation of the differences between different tires. This is most probably the main reason for the observed contradiction between different test results. In order to control changes in stud protrusions, a so-called two-protrusion method was developed. For each tire model to be studied in the test, two sets of test tires are used with different stud protrusions. Both sets of tires are examined, and the final results are given with linear corrections for all tested tires to correspond to a certain stud protrusion, e.g. 1.2mm. When the so-called reference tire, used to control the changes in test conditions, is a studded tire, with protrusions changing during the course of the test, the risk of drawing incorrect conclusions is great. The stud protrusion of the reference tire can be standardized by using glued studs. The experience from this method is encourag- ing. The method works especially well when the stud protrusion used in the reference tire is as close as possible to that of the studied tires. The grip of a winter tire depends largely on weather and road conditions. A studded winter tire is at its best in slippery conditions on smooth ice, whereas on rough ice and on snow an unstudded win- ter tire can reach a good friction level, comparable to that of some studded tires. Wear may have a notable effect on the grip of the tire. The grip of studded tires will usually slacken with wear more than that of fric- tion tires. 940094. (P-273) Bringing agricultural tractor hydraulics to life at -30°C. Donald J. Macdonald, John Deere. 10</page><page sequence="10">940094-940108 The intent of this paper is to explain specific considerations nec- essary to successfully start up and use an axial piston hydraulic pump system at -30°C without changing to a winter- grade hydraulic fluid. The particular vehicle involved was a new design of agricul- tural tractor. Testing was done on drivetrain parts in a small cold room, and complete prototype tractors were tested in a large cold room. The modifications to the hydraulic system resulted in a vehi- cle which starts readily at -30°C and can start to steer in less than one minute. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 940096.

Lohuis, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp. A test program has been conducted to evaluate the low- tempera- ture cranking, pumping and stating characteristics of light and heavy duty diesel trucks using various lubricants. The low-temperature performance of oils with different SAE viscosity grades and base stock type were evaluated. Included are formulations based on con- ventional mineral, hydrocracked and synthetic base stocks. The results show that lower viscosity grade oils using special base stocks, in particular synthetics, demonstrate improved low- temperature cranking and pumping performance over conventional lubricants. The engine test results are compared against laboratory low-temperature flow, cranking and pumpability tests. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940098. (P-273) Lube basestock manufacturing technology and engine oil pumpability. Albert Rossi, Exxon Chemical Co. The trouble-free operation of an engine during and after starting at low temperatures is achieved by an uninterrupted supply of oil to points of friction, i.e., by the oifs pumpability. A key parameter in pumpability is wax, and in particular its composition, concentra- tion and morphology. Wax or paraffin compositions of engine oils are dependent upon the basestocks used in the formulation. The hydrocarbon compositions of lube basestocks and the carbon num- ber distribution for each hydrocarbon class (n-paraffins, isoparaf- fins, cycloparaffins, aromatics) depend upon the crude oil's source and more importantly on the manufacturing technology used. In North America, there are essentially four process pathways used to produce lubricant basestocks: solvent extraction or hydrocracking, followed by solvent dewaxing or catalytic dewaxing. Each process pathway can produce basestocks with similar physical properties (viscosity, viscosity index, pour point), but these basestocks may have markedly different paraffin compositions (concentration, car- bon number distribution and paraffin type), which impart different low temperature pumpability properties to engine oils formulated with these basestocks. In contrast, basestocks produced at different refineries via the same pathway have similar paraffin (wax) compo- sitions and thus, similar pumpability properties. In pumpability tests on three SAE 10W-40 oils (ASTM D 4684 at - 25°C) formulated with basestocks produced via three different pathways, the oils exhibited different pumpability properties. The non-conventional, mineral typed, basestocks are manufac- tured by these same processes, except that the severity of the process technology has been increased. These non- conventional basestocks have good pumpability properties because the wax crystals that formed have a poorly defined structure and are easily sheared. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940099.

(P-273) The use of vehicle drive cycles to assess spark plug fouling performance. P. J. Shayler and J. Dixon, University of Nottingham; and R. M. Isaacs, Ford Motor Co. Spark plug fouling is a common problem when vehicles are repeatedly operated for very short periods, particularly at low tem- peratures. This paper describes a test procedure which uses a series of short, high-load drive cycles to assess plug fouling under realistic conditions. The engine is force cooled between drive cycles in order to increase test throughput. Spark plug resistance is shown to be a poor indicator of the effect of fouling on engine performance and the rate of misfiring is given as an alternative measure. An auto- mated technique to detect misfires from engine speed data is described. This has been used to investigate the effect of spark plug type, fuelling level and spark timing on fouling. Spark plugs which are designed to run hotter are found to be more resistant to plug foul- ing. Isolated adjustments to fuelling level and spark timing calibra- tions within the range providing acceptable performance have a weak effect on susceptibility to plug fouling. These effects are syn- ergetic, and when fuelling and spark timing are both optimized this susceptibility is reduced substantially compared to cases when pro- duction calibration values have been used. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940104. (P-273) A portable radar for ice thickness measure- ments. Martti Toikka, Ins.tsto Toikka Ltd.; and Periti Vainikainen, Helsinki University of Technology. A high-resolution and light-weight impulse radar has been devel- oped for short range detection of subsurface objects and interfaces. This radar can be used as a hand-held instrument or it can be mounted on a vehicle. The new radar is optimized for fairly short measuring distances (about 2 m) with good accuracy (few centime- ters). Modern data processing and display technology has been used in order to reduce the power consumption and physical size of the instrument. The radar has proved to be very useful in ice thickness measurements. For safety reasons it is essential to measure continu- ous profiles of the ice thickness and to find the weak spots in order to avoid vehicles to sink through the ice. The impulse radar mea- sures a continuous profile of ice thickness without any conventional methods, e.g. by drilling holes in ice and measuring the thickness with a scale stick. 940107. (P-273) General preheating system for cold starting of internal combustion engine. Gabriel Anghelache and Nicolae Boriaru, Polytechnic University of Bucharest. The paper presents a study of the preheating process of a diesel engine functioning at very low ambiental temperatures. A general preheating of the engine was used. The study consists of a mathe- matical modeling for the unsteady heat transfer in the cylinder and in the oil sump. Two versions of oil preheating equipment are ana- lyzed. The numerical results are compared with the experimental ones. 940108. (P-273) Initial study of railplugs as an aid for cold starting of diesels. K. Shen, R. D. Matthews, J. P. Chiù, M. H. Dar- den, R. W. Faidley, S. P. Nichols, and W. F. Weldon, University of Texas at Austin. The results of continuing investigations of a new type of ignitor, the railplug, are reported. Previous studies have shown that railplugs can produce a high velocity jet of plasma. Additionally, railplugs 11</page><page sequence="11">940108-940130 have the potential of assuring ignition under adverse conditions, such as cold start of an IDI diesel engine, because the railplug plasma can force ignition in the combustion chamber rather than relying on autoignition under cold start conditions. In this paper, engine data are presented to demonstrate the improved cold starting capability obtainable with railplugs. Data acquired using a railplug are compared to results obtained using no assist and using glow plugs. The engine used for this investigation will not start without glow plugs (or some starting aid) at temperatures below 0°C, and the manufacturer's specification of the cold start limit for this engine using glow plugs is -24°C. Railplugs are able to initiate combustion at -29°C in one to two seconds with no preheating. The experimental facility did not allow exploration of starting at colder temperatures. The results show that railplugs can extend the cold start temperature for IDI diesels to colder temperatures. It is believed that these results also indicate the potential of railplugs as a cold start aid for DI die- sels. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940109. (P-273) Unique cold start method used on Volvo's new 12L unit injector diesel engine. Tommy Gustavsson and Hans-Olof Cederberg, Volvo Truck Corp. Volvo Truck Corporation has developed a new cold-start method for heavy duty engines. The background for this new method is to get a high cold-start quality, at a low product cost for the customer This paper describes the development of the new cold-start method, the layout for the system and the start procedure in low ambient temperature. The basic element for this start principle is to increase the tem- perature in the combustion chamber before the combustion begins. The tools for achieving higher temperature are the following: 1) precranking a number of revolutions without fuel injection; and, 2) produce a back-pressure in the exhaust pipe to reduce the gas exchange and decrease the loss of heat in the combustion chamber. Volvo Truck Corporation uses the new cold-start method in pro- duction of the D12 engine. At the Detroit-94 SAE conference, a paper entitled "The New Volvo D12 Heavy Duty Diesel Engine" will give a complete description of the D12 engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940110. (P-273) Three approaches to winter traction testing using instrumented vehicles. S. Shoop and B. Young, U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab.; R. Alger, Michigan Technological Univ. ; and J. Davis, Testing Services and Instrumen- tation Co. Traction on winter surfaces was measured using three test vehi- cles, each designed to measure traction for a different purpose: vehi- cle mobility research (CRREL instrumented vehicle), commercial tire testing (Uniroyal-Goodrich traction tester) and airport runway safety (SAAB friction tester). The traction measured with each method is comparable, but there are systematic differences due to the effects of the surface materials and test and analysis techniques. This comparison serves as the basis for collaboration between the various traction and data analyses for traction testing and evaluation. 940111. (P-273) Evaluation of engines in passenger cars and light duty vehicles - Correlation of test results between testbed and road testing under sub zero conditions. Hubertus Lemke, Volkswagen AG. This paper presents the results of a comparison between testbed and road testing for various engine related test procedures. The development of engines and engine management systems for pas- senger cars and light duty vehicles requires extensive testing. Very important is the behavior of the engine/vehicle combinations at extreme cold ambient temperatures, which are defined by our cus- tomers. Unfortunately, the time period during the year when one can consistently find these temperatures is very limited and in most cases the time period is much too short to conduct all the necessary tests. Therefore a large part of the testing has to be done on a testbed (cold chamber with dynamometer). 940112. (P-273) Experimental car and trailer axle cornering characteristics at low friction conditions. Nils G. Vâgstedt, Royal Institute of Technology. To determine the axle cornering characteristics of a car and trailer combination from measurements of the vehicle motion. Axle force generation is derived from the equations of motion of a non-dimensional mathematical model, based on the "Bicycle model" using one "averaged tire" at each axle, with the effects of steering and suspension design included in the axle cornering char- acteristics. This facilitates analysis of the dynamics of the combination, including individual axle cornering characteristics and hence, char- acteristic velocity. The empirical "magic tire formula" was applied to the calculated axle characteristics. Experimental results of maneuvering on lake ice are confirmed by simulation and linear analysis. 940114. (P-273) Boeing research aerodynamic/icing tunnel capabilities and calibration. George E. Cain, Roger F. Yurczyk, Dale L. Belter, and Seethram H. Chintamani, Boeing Co. Flight testing of aircraft under natural icing conditions can be extremely tedious, time consuming, costly, and somewhat risky. However, such testing has been required to demonstrate the effec- tiveness of anti-icing systems and to certify new aircraft models. To reduce the need for extensive flight testing, Boeing has built a new icing tunnel that has the capability for developing ice shapes and evaluating anti-icing features on full scale sections of critical parts of the aircraft. The icing tunnel was made by modifying an existing 5 ft. by 8 ft. Boeing Wind Tunnel to add icing capabilities. This paper describes the design specifications, the tunnel capabili- ties, and the major equipment systems and presents the results of the tunnel calibration relative to the specified requirements. 940116. (P-273) Wing/ground ice detection system for air- craft. William G. Kunik, Rosemount Aerospace Inc. The ability to accurately and reliably annunciate the presence of aircraft wing contaminants greatly reduces the hazards of aircraft operation in winter precipitation environments. A new wing con- tamination detection system was designed to detect contaminants on the surface of an aircraft wing. Testing on a Fokker F100 aircraft was completed during the 1992-1993 winter icing season. The test- ing revealed that the system was able to detect ice, frost, hoar frost, and deicing fluid mixtures on the wing. The system performance was evaluated against Fokker' s current requirements for an opera- tional system. 940117. (P-273) Ice thickness and particle size from an eddy current deicer. Samuel O. Smith, Electroimpact, Inc. This paper details the icing wind tunnel test results of a new eddy current repulsion deicing system (EDS). There are only a trio of in- flight, anti-icing or deicing systems used on aircraft. Hot engine bleed air, electrothermal blankets, and pneumatic boots are either energy intensive or force the aircraft to fly with relatively large ice particles attached to critical aerodynamic surfaces. Several ideas have been put forward for electrical pulsed deicing systems. The EDS consumes little power, maintains ice thickness buildup less than 2.5 mm, and sheds small ice particles less than 150 mm2. 940130. (SP- 1011) Diesel engine design for the 1990s. David F. Merrion, Detriot Diesel Corp. Just over 100 years ago, in December 1892, the first patent was issued by the German Reich Patent office to Rudolf Diesel, covering his new engine concept. Although his original idea was to put the Carnot cycle into practice, he soon realized that this was impossible. However, his auto-ignition cycle engine has proved to be an effi- cient and durable power plant well suited for many applications. 12</page><page sequence="12">940130-940136 Diesel's early efforts were hampered by the inability to produce close clearance hydraulic fuel injection equipment. However, a form of fuel fumigation into the intake air proved effective enough to demonstrate that the diesel engine could achieve better than 26 per- cent thermal efficiency in 1897. This was sufficient to convince engine producers that the diesel should be developed for production and numerous licenses were granted to market the engine in Europe and abroad. By 1904, 141 patents had been applied for in 37 coun- tries around the world. The diesel engine was introduced to North America by Adolphus Busch, the famous German Brewery owner, who acquired the patent rights in 1897 for the United States and Canada. Busch founded the Diesel Motor Company of America to make engines designed abroad. Unfortunately, these early production engines were plagued with problems hurting this marketing effort. This led to increased development efforts around the world that solved the problems and paved the way for the spread of engine sales in North America. Unfortunately, Busch never was enthusiastic about producing the engines, thus limiting the number of engines marketed before 1912. However, in 1911 Gebrader Sulzer and Busch formed a new com- pany, the Busch-Sulzer Bros. - Diesel Engine Company just before the North American patents expired. This proved to be a successful engine producer that was eventually taken over by the well-known North American Nordberg. The diesel proved to be much more popular in Europe during the early part of the twentieth century, leading to diesel development for stationary power, marine and locomotive applications. Each appli- cation had its unique problems but the engineers overcame them and put many engines into commercial service around the world. Some of these original installations were still in service as late as 1955. Eventually, the low price of fuel that could be consumed in the diesel and the engine's thermal efficiency advantage over other power plants led to world wide acceptance. Another step towards broader acceptance was the introduction of turbocharging technology in the thirties and high boost turbocharg- ing that became possible in the fifties. From then on, diesels could be found successfully engineered into all applications including one opposed-piston, two-stroke airplane engine that was in series- production and proved its operational reliability during numerous trans-Atlantic flights. 940131. (SP- 101 2) Behavioral modeling in the high-level mul- tiplex system simulation. Andrea Borin and Hassan Nazha, Magneti Marelli. In the last few years a large number of Top-Do wn approaches that allow system designers to partition multiplex systems have been proposed. Using these methods different structures of the system can be obtained so that automotive system designers need only to evaluate the limits of the system and which architectural solution satisfies the functional requirements. The performance evaluation can be achieved by means of system simulation and, to do this, it is mandatory to raise the abstraction level of the system description in order to model and verify complex systems more easily. In this paper we present the use of VHDL (Vhsic Hardware Description Language) for high-level description and simulation of multiplex systems. 940132. (SP- 101 2) Sirex, vehicle electric network simulation software. Hervé Duval and Christophe Brient, Renault S. A. A large increase in the power on board vehicles is expected in the years to come. More complex electric networks will then be required to provide adequate reliability and minimal petrol con- sumption to reduce pollutant emissions from thermal engine pow- ered vehicles. The scope of this paper is to introduce Sirex, a model- ing software package which was developed to simulate current and future architectures, multi-voltage, high voltage networks, etc. We describe hereafter the main characteristics of Sirex, its models, the software architecture, ..., and we give some examples of simulations results. 940133. (SP- 101 2) Analyzing the real-time characteristics of Class C communications in CAN through discrete event simula- tions. Bhargav P. Upender, United Technologies Research Center. Class C vehicle communications impose demanding require- ments on an underlying communication protocol. The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol, developed for automotive applica- tions, addresses these requirements through collision avoidance and global prioritization. In this paper, a generic workload for Class C applications is presented. The workload defines minimum require- ments and provides the stimulus for a discrete-event model of the CAN. The simulations reveal the importance of proper synchroniza- tion of the periodic messages, quantify response times for messages with different priorities, and measure network operation under vari- ous speeds. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940134. (SP- 10 12) Performance modeling of automotive mul- tiplex systems. Oliver J. Rumpf, Michael J. Eckrich, and Gero G. Kempf BMW AG. The increasing number of local control units in automotive sys- tems led to growing emphasis on developing and using multiplex systems. For reasons of price and robustness the use of asynchro- nous and slow multiplex systems is preferred. Since the communication volume now reaches critical dimen- sions in peak load situations during the use of those systems, new concepts on different communication levels have to be developed. Due to the use of many different message types (wide range of message length) and the statistical dependence of the communica- tion behavior of control units (e.g., question-answer- combinations), the application of standard methodologies is only partly suitable for a performance analysis of automotive multiplex systems. In this paper a simulation concept is proposed, which combines the different methodologies used for modeling embedded control units (finite state machines), multiplex systems (queuing theory) and external input (statistical approximation based on real data). Finally first analysis results and deduced proposals for an opti- mized communication protocol are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940135. (SP- 101 2) Data reduction in automotive multiplex systems. Gero G. Kempf, Michael J. Eckrich, and Oliver J. Rumpf, BMW AG. Increasing demand for utilities like navigation systems or user- defined electronic phonebooks on one hand and sophisticated engine and gear controls on the other hand leads to growing bus load between distributed local control units. This paper shows the benefits and the characteristics of various state of the art data-compression algorithms and their impact on typ- ical automotive multiplex dataclasses. The evaluation and optimization of promising algorithms can be done via a proposed 4 'communications prototyping" -approach. The hardware/software components of such a rapid prototyping package are outlined. Finally, first performance results of suitable data- compression measures are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940136. (SP- 101 2) Testing automotive systems modeled by finite state machines. Michael J. Echrich, Gero G. Kempf, and Oli- ver J. Rumpf, BMW AG. The use of micro controllers in automotive systems renders the coordination of about 150 actors (70 electric motors, 15 magnetic valves and 50 relays). The resulting complexity of those systems as well as the requested zero defects demands time consuming testing. This work describes a method of performing test-scenarios, start- ing from a zero defect running specification, modeled by finite state machines. The test-scenarios are intended to determine whether a given system meets all specification requirements. 13</page><page sequence="13">940136-940144 First, a kind of structured modeling reactive automotive systems is deduced. Next, some important test selection methods, developed for the case the specification is given in the form of a finite state machine, are considered. Finally, a procedure and method for per- forming minimized complete test-scenarios for automotive systems are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940137. (SP- 101 2) Using the MC68332 TPU to implement the J1850 protocol. Bruce Beyeler, Rollins Group of Companies; and Todd Langley, Automotive Diagnostic Equipment Corp . This paper describes an implementation of the J 1850 protocol using the Time Processor Unit (TPU) of the Motorola MC68332 microcontroller. In particular, it describes the creation of an intelli- gent J 1850 interface that fits onto a PCMCIA Type III PC Card. A key factor allowing this much functionality to be placed into a PC Card is the integration of the J 1850 interface into the MC68332 itself, rather than relying on external ICs to provide the network interface. This paper describes the organization of the J 1850 inter- face and shows how it can be integrated into any MC68332 design in which the TPA is available for use as a communication processor. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940138. A comparison of physical layer devices for Class B and Class C multiplex systems (using recommended practice SAE J1699 for testing physical layer devices). Mark Zachos, Dearborn Group, Inc.; Marvin Stone, Oklahoma State Univ.; and Scott Eisenhart, Texas Instruments. The objective of this paper is to suggest the advantages of using SAE J 1699 tests and methods as a basis for characterization of phys- ical layer devices. This paper will examine some of the commer- cially available physical layer IC' s that could be used to drive Class B and C multiplex networks. Device characteristics such as propa- gation delays, current consumption, and common mode will be pres- ented. These characteristics could be used to test device perfor- mance in Class B and Class C multiplex applications. Also pres- ented will be an introduction to the new SAE J 1699 Recommended Practice for multiplex device testing and how J 1699 might be used for physical layer device testing. 940139. (SP- 101 2) Distributed communications in embedded military systems. Paul C. Richardson, U.S. Army Vetronics Tech- nology Center. The development of the Standard Army Vetronics Architecture (SAVA) is our response to performance and cost issues raised in a highly volatile arena. The architecture provides application develop- ers with a network type interface to distributed communications facilities. Technology insertion with minimal system impact is pro- vided through interface standardization. Currently a token ring bus with redundancy and reconfiguration built in at the data link and physical link layers provides a fault tolerant communications link. SAVA shows promise in providing emerging embedded systems with a communications platform that can respond to evolving tech- nology. 940140. (SP- 101 2) Fault management in the Time Triggered Protocol (TTP). H. Kopetz, Technical University of Vienna. The Time Triggered Protocol (TTP) is an efficient real-time pro- tocol for automotive networks. The TTP class C version of the pro- tocol provides all services needed for the implementation of safety critical distributed fault-tolerant class C systems. The TTP class B version of the protocol provides an economical solution to class A and B applications. Both protocol versions use the same frame for- mat on the communication network and the same application soft- ware interface. This paper describes the protocol objectives, com- pares the functionality of TTP/C and TTP/B, and focuses on the fault management strategy of the TTP/C protocol. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940141. (SP- 101 2) Network application layer. Wolfhard Lawrenz, I+ME GmbH. Networked systems inherently must be considered as highly complex systems. In order to guarantee high quality and highly effi- cient results while designing and applying networked systems the degree of complexity to be handled by the system designer must be decreased to an acceptable level. The methodology to achieve this goal is to hide details in software/hardware support drivers. The subsequently presented paper gives an overview on CAL = CAN Application Layer. CAL has been defined in Europe by indus- trial manufacturers of CAN networked controller systems. As the CAL features and characteristics are of generic type the gained results may be of interest for being considered in automotive appli- cations. Furthermore CAL can be regarded as a generic higher layer for autobus protocols whether it is CAN, VAN, J 1850, ... Therefore, the ideas presented in this paper may be a point of discussion for the design of a generic automotive communication layer. 940142. (SP- 1012) ACP - Ford's audio control protocol. Bruce D. Emaus, Consultant. A new network solution has been developed and implemented by Ford Audio engineering to support several upcoming distributed audio product programs. Organized around the seven layers of the OSI model and imple- mented primarily in software, ACP is based on the physical layer of SAE J1708 (same as Ford's DCL) and a portion of the SAE J2178 message structure. ACP' s UART-based protocol depends heavily on a conversation structure that utilizes message coupling to provide reliable distrib- uted control functionality. The use of controlled network traffic, a collision avoidance tech- nique, and a structured message language enhance the efficiency of this new network realization. 940143. (SP- 1029) Direct estimation of cyclic combustion pressure variability using engine speed fluctuations in an inter- nal combustion engine. Francis T. Connolly, Ford Motor Co. Cyclic variability (CV) in combustion in IC-SI engines, mani- fested as variation in combustion pressure, is a long term as well as a contemporary problem. CV and its relation to several areas of engine control and diagnostics are discussed. A novel stochastic model relating combustion pressure to crankshaft velocity in an IC-SI engine is presented. This model incorporates a random com- bustion pressure signal model composed of a deterministic wave- form and a random sequence modeling cyclic variation in combus- tion pressure. A discrete recursion is developed relating this sequence to noisy measurements of velocity. The inverse problem of reconstructing this sequence from one measurement of velocity per combustion is solved using a signal processing deconvolution method. Experimental results using real-world engine data are pres- ented verifying the theoretical developments for low to moderate engine speed and moderate engine load. This reconstruction of cyclic pressure variability is simple to implement and may provide practical utility for engine control and diagnostics. 940144. (SP- 1029) Misfire detection and cylinder pressure reconstruction for SI engines. Yaojung Shiao and John J. Moskwa, University of Wisconsin. Many researchers have studied and developed methods for on- board engine combustion misfire detection in production vehicles. Misfiring can damage the catalytic converter within a short time and can lead to increased emission levels. For that reason, the on-board detection of engine misfire is one requirement of the On Board Diagnosis II (OBDII) Regulation and a recent interest for many researchers. One object in this paper is to propose a misfire detection method for multi-cylinder SI engines. The detection is achieved by examining the estimated cylinder pressures and combustion heat release rates in engine cylinders. The Sliding Observer methodology is applied in these estimations. This detection method provides a 14</page><page sequence="14">940144-940151 reliable and low-cost way to diagnose engine misfires. The other object of the paper is to eliminate large estimation errors due to sys- tem unobservability and reconstruct cylinder pressures. These reconstructed cylinder pressures are advantageous for use in engine control or other applications. 940145. (SP- 1029) Estimation of the cylinder pressure in a SI engine using the variation of crankshaft speed. Byeongjin Lim , Inkeon Lim , Jongbum Park, Youngjin Son, and Eungseo Kim, Seoul National Univ. This paper describes measuring the cylinder pressure in a SI engine using the variation of crankshaft speed. Assuming engine dynamics as a single degree of freedom the energy equation is derived. Through some assumptions each cylinder pressure can be estimated from the pressure torque. Through this study, cylinder pressures by this method show good accord with measured value in low to medium speed ranges. For more accurate analysis the crank angle based modeling of friction and vibration is required. 940146. (SP- 1029) Measurement and analysis of knock in a SI engine using the cylinder pressure and block vibration sig- nals. Kwang Min Chun, Yonsei Univ.; and Kyung Woon Kim, Dae- woo Motors Co. In this study, spark-ignition engine knock was studied experi- mentally. Cylinder pressure and cylinder block vibration of a four cylinder SI engine were measured. Knock characteristics, such as knock intensity, knock cycle percentage, knock occurrence crank angle, were determined from pressure and vibration signals using different analysis methods. Methods using band-pass filter, third derivative and step method, which was developed in this study, were shown to be the most suit- able. The step method only used signals above threshold value dur- ing knocking and, as a result, both pressure and vibration signal analysis results with this method showed good signal-to-noise ratio. The knock intensities calculated from cylinder pressure and block vibration were proportional to each other over a wide range. It was confirmed in this study that vibration signals were useful in knock detection. More accurate results were achieved by using nar- row band-pass filtering frequency range which avoided engine's res- onance frequencies. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940147. (SP- 1029) Locating the main conversion period exactly, using a newly developed characteristic value of the com- bustion pressure in an SI engine. Klaus Gebauer and Herbert Müller, Technische Universität Braunschweig. This paper describes a new way to locate the position of the com- bustion process in a spark-ignited engine. This method uses a char- acteristic value which is calculated from indicated high pressure (Pmax). This calculation requires much less time than traditional methods and allows the on-board-management (OBM) system to predict misfire cycles, and therefore, to avoid them. The new characteristic value correlates closely to given percent- ages of the rate of converted energy, and has been tested using high relative air/fuel ratios (À), high rates of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and different fuels. Use of this method in the OBM systems allows extremely sensitive adjustments of ignition timing (ocig), which maximize efficiency and minimize pollutant emissions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940148. (SP- 1029) Relationship among harmonics from the diagram of pressure and parameters of operation of the engine. Emilio Navarro Arévalo and Emilio Varela Arroyo, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. From the pressure signal, in the cylinder of an spark-ignition engine, measured experimentally, we have obtained the variation of pressure due only to the process of combustion. We have proceeded to the study of this signal using Fourier's analysis and we have obtained several relations between the har- monic's amplitude of the transformed and the engine's operation parameters. These relations can be used as tools of detection of trou- bles or anomalous processes in the engine's combustion. 940149. (SP- 1029) Automatic control of cylinder by cylinder air-fuel mixture using a proportional exhaust gas sensor. Kevin J. Bush, Neil J. Adams, Sanjay Dua, and Craig R. Markyvech, Motorola Inc. Cylinder to cylinder air-fuel imbalance in an engine due to geo- metrical factors and component tolerances may be overcome by a system capable of individually controlling the sir-fuel ratio for each cylinder. A stable feedback controller for individual cylinder air- fuel ratio was designed using dynamic models of the gas transport process and the proportional exhaust gas sensor (UEGO). The con- troller was tested using a proportional exhaust gas sensor located in each bank of a V6 engine. Preliminary test results indicate that auto- matic balancing of the air-fuel ratio to each cylinder can reduce car- bon monoxide emissions compared to a feedback system controlling overall air-fuel ratio. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940150. (SP- 1029) Performance improvement from dual energy ignition on a methanol injected Cosworth engine. Edward VanDuyne and Paul Porreca, Adrenaline Inc. Based on testing done on a 4-cy linder Cosworth dual overhead cam engine, running on methanol, a significant performance improvement was achieved with a Dual Energy Distributor-Less Ignition system. Peak power was increased by 2%, with an over- all average power increase of 3% over the entire power curve. Peak torque was increased by 4% and, most significantly, MBT timing advance was decreased by 7 degrees. The system was tested with one ignition coil per cylinder, discharging 2 Joules of energy /firing to 7,200 rpm. The Dual energy ignition system delivers energy to the spark plug more efficiently by separating the voltage creation device from the current delivery device. This separation improves the impedance matching of the circuit during the SPARK and the ARC modes that occur during the ignition process. It is very simple to implement with the addition of two low-cost components to each ignition coil. The system does, however, require one shielded coil per cylinder to meet Federal requirements for electromagnetic interference. The Dual Energy Ignition provides the benefit of allowing the engine control system to significantly vary the energy delivered to the spark plug. During cold starts energy delivered can be increased to reduce hydrocarbon emissions. Under normal operating condi- tions, requiring lower levels of ignition energy, this system consum- ers less power than current OEM systems. This ignition was originally developed to enhance lean combus- tion. It was first tested at the Arthur D. Little laboratories, showing fuel economy gains of 6 to 10% were feasible. The biggest benefit comes from the extension of the lean limit, reducing the level of NOx created in a lean-burn engine. 940151. (SP- 1029) Automated system for optimized calibra- tion of engine management systems. G. Schmitz, U. Oligschläger, and G. Eifler, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH &amp; Co. KG; and H. Lech- ner, Carl Schenck AG. Due to the stringent emission standards modern engine concepts require special equipment for reducing exhaust pollutants and mini- mizing fuel consumption. Usually all those engine functions are managed by an electronic engine control unit (ECU). A good potential for emission reduction is dependent on a well optimized set of calibration maps, tables and constants, contained in the ECU. The time to evaluate an optimum data design strongly depends on the number of these calibration parameters. With an increasing number of such parameters, there is a need for sophisti- cated test systems which automatically initiate parameters varia- 15</page><page sequence="15">940151-940159 tions, perform necessary measurements and search for an optimized engine calibration. VEGA is an automatic optimization system that controls the whole calibration process from the first basic mapping until the final programming of the ECU. It performs much faster and, following exact mathematical algorithms, results in better reproducibility than with manual optimization. The time required for an automatic operation depends on the Optimization-Algorithm and the chosen parameters. Various results are shown and discussed. 940152. (SP- 1029) Interactive engine development - A new approach. Anthony O. Dye , David J. Battison, and Neil J. Good- ship , Epicas, Ltd. Engine development is an information-intensive business. Design improvements have to be sought against an increasing array of objective criteria and constraints imposed by technical, economic and legislative forces. The volume of information emerging from engine test cells threatens to isolate the development engineer behind a wall of 4 4info gluť ' . Solutions often then require the inter- vention of computer specialists with their machines, increasingly separating the development engineer's evaluation from engine test events. New, small, powerful instruments which employ parallel infor- mation processing, are now entering the market. They are able to transform sensor system output into immediately useful informa- tion, displayed to the operator at rates commensurate with the cap- ture rate of the raw data. This new level of power and performance is complemented by absence of operational complexity for non- specialist users. The paper briefly explores the main characteristics of these machines, the opportunities they offer to the development engineer and the cost-benefit advantages they can grant to the industry. 940153. Optimizing properties of automotive cylinder heads cast of aluminum. Paul H. Mikkola, General Motors, Inc.; and John A. Redemske, Metal Casting Technology, Inc. An analysis of the long range potential for improvement of alu- minum castings for use in automotive applications was made. Com- parisons of lost foam, semi-permanent (SPM), and sand casting were done using cylinder heads as the test configuration. The casting processes were compared on the basis of tensile properties, as well as their basic capabilities to provide the highest strength. It was found that, while all three processes are very useful, sand casting can be used to make the highest properties in a wide variety of alloys. Countergravity casting sand molds at low metal tempera- tures with controlled amounts of hydrogen yielded castings with excellent properties and required minimum risering. This same effect could not be obtained in heads cast in the semi- permanent mold process, due to segregation of hydrogen caused by the metal molds. Hot isostatic pressing (HIPping) was required to produce the optimum properties , and sand castings with controlled hydrogen HIPped very well. A new low cost HIPping process developed should increase the use of HIPping in the near füture. The ultimate in stiffness was shown to be provided by aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs). Metallurgy of castings made with up to 40% particulate silicon carbide is discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940154.

This paper describes the work undertaken by BMW with assis- tance from Alean to examine the manufacture and performance of stamped sheet monocoque Body-In- White structures. A range of component and structure trials was conducted culminating in the manufacture and test of a small number of vehicles based on the cur- rent BMW 3-Series architecture. This program illustrated that sub- stantial weight saving could be achieved whilst maintaining the nec- essary level of structural performance. 940155. The use of probabilistic methods to determine the energy absorption of circular thin wall aluminum tubes. J. F. McMichael, Aluminum Company of America. To determine the effect of variation in geometry and material properties on the energy absorption during axial crush of aluminum circular tubes, Mahmood and Paluszny's predictive equations were coupled with PROBAN, a probabilistic analysis code in which the distributions of model parameters are input, and distributions of result parameters are calculated. For the purposes of this study, minimum values and typical distributions of the model parameters were assumed. Calculations based on minimum material properties and dimensions indicated that a mean load of 40.3 kN would be obtained. PROBAN analyses determined that the mean load that would be achieved 95% of the time, ranged from 41.8 to 44.6 kN, depending on the assumed distributions of yield strength and dimen- sions. This indicates that further lightweighting of the circular cross section is possible. This study also demonstrates that reliability methods can be successfully used in the design of automotive com- ponents. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940156. An in-depth analysis of automotive aluminum recy- cling in the year 2010. Lonny R. Gorban, George K. Ng, and Michael B. Tessieri, Reynolds Metals Co. The use of aluminum in automotive applications is growing. The 1991 calendar year automobiles used over 190 pounds per vehicle. The growth for aluminum applications is expected to be significant over the next ten years. Expected changes in end use and alloy mix pose challenges to the recycling system. These challenges need con- sideration by both the automotive and aluminum industries. This paper discusses these challenges and presents detailed analysis of the weight and chemistry aspects of automotive aluminum recy- cling. It also demonstrates a feasible and efficient recycling system in which post-consumer scrap is consumed in new production. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940158.

Bal- dantoni, Alean International Limited; and E. R. Pickering, Reynolds Metals Co. The use of aluminum is rapidly gaining acceptance for structural applications in this automotive industry. While laser beam welding offers many advantages for joining of aluminum alloys, it also pos- sesses certain inherent characteristics that differentiates laser beam welding of aluminum alloys from ferrous materials. These charac- teristics include aluminum's high reflectivity, large differences in vapor pressure between aluminum and many of its alloying constitu- ents, and relatively low surface tension and viscosity in the molten state. This paper addresses process requirements for effective laser beam welding of aluminum alloys designed primarily for automo- tive applications and characterization of welded joints commonly used in the automotive industry. 940159. Extruded aluminum bumper system. Patrick A. Allen, Aluminum Company of America; Dennis W. MCullough, Miles Inc.; and Soo A. Tan, Aluminum Company of America. An innovative, lightweight bumper system has been designed and developed in conjunction with an OEM, Alcoa, and Miles Inc. The bumper system uses extruded aluminum (6061-T6) for the rein- forcement beam and mounting brackets, and resilient polyurethane foam (Bayfill EA-70) for the energy absorbing material. There are two key advantages of this lightweight system. The first is that the extruded aluminum beam can be highly swept to meet the demanding styling requirements, and the second is that the polyurethane foam is directly molded to the aluminum beam for part consolidation and assembly cost reduction. By integrating extruded 16</page><page sequence="16">940159-940165 aluminum and polyurethane foam, this system provides tighter dimensional tolerances not common in most bumper systems today. In addition, the extruded system provides low mass due to variable wall thicknesses and a major reduction in tooling costs over other manufacturing methods. 940160. A fresh look at resistance spot welding of aluminum automotive components. 7. R. Auhl and E. P. Patrick , Aluminum Company of America. With a worldwide interest in aluminum as a major structural component in automotive manufacture, a renewed investigation of resistance spot welding as a joining method was undertaken. A com- parison was made among various methods and standards for evalu- ating resistance spot welds. Included is a review of the criteria for electrode life testing and an examination of the resistance sport welding behavior of 5XXX alloy as compared to 2XXX and 6XXX alloys. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940161. The effect of crystallographic texture on the forma- bility of AA 2036 autobody sheet. J. D. Bryant , A. J. Beaudoin, and R. T. VanDyke, Reynolds Metals Co. The aluminum alloy 2036 is presently being used in the produc- tion of automotive body panels. In the study presented, specimens of 2036-T4 with varying crystallographic textures were subjected to tensile testing and limiting dome height (LDH) evaluations in an effort to gauge the effect of texture on formability and stamping per- formance. To describe the texture, relative magnitudes of ideal tex- ture components were derived from the orientation distribution function. Finite element analysis was used to study the effect of anisotropic properties due to texture on thinning in the LDH test. The impact of textural character on formability is discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940162. Metal ion implantation for the automotive market. James R. Treglio, Anthony J. Perry, and Robert J. Stinner, ISM Technologies, Inc. The practice of metal ion implantation is currently experiencing a simplification in the technology and an increase in the beam cur- rent available for industrial use. The availability of large cathodic arc implantation units generating metal ions with great throughput permits the question of the processing rate and the economics of ion implantation to be revisited. In the present work, an assessment is presented of the effect of cost per unit area of implantation on the applicability of the process to solving problems associated with reducing auto emissions and/or increasing fuel efficiency. Consider- ation is given to metal ion implantation to allow 1 ) weight reduction by substituting aluminum and other light materials for steel, 2) pro- tection of components from the corrosive effect of new fuels such as methanol, and 3) alteration of the optical properties of glass including increasing transmission in the visible and/or reduction in the infrared or ultraviolet. The cost of implantation using mass sepa- ration accelerators is of the order $1 0,000-$ 1 00, 000/m2, which is acceptable to the medical industry. As a spin-off to the US Fusion program, the cathodic arc metal ion implantation systems developed by ISM Technologies reduce the cost drastically, to the range $10-$100/m2 necessary to penetrate the automotive industry. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940163. A quantitative decision-making approach for assist- ing in the selection of manufacturing processes, applied to cut- ting of extrusions for automotive aluminum spaceframes. Israel Stol, Automotive Structures International. For the past ten years, Alcoa has supported a comprehensive pro- gram to design and develop advanced manufacturing techniques for the fabrication of aluminum intensive vehicles. AIV's, as they are called, are considerably lighter and thus more fuel efficient than today's steel vehicles. Because cars traditionally have been made of steel, the manufac- turing methods employed with this material have evolved into very mature technologies. But, the inherent differences between steel and aluminum prevent the direct applications of these technologies to the fabrication of aluminum. Alcoa's current investigations focus primarily on a spaceframe concept. The spaceframe idea is to build vehicles by welding cast components and extruded lineais in a truss configuration. Traditionally, cars have been assembled from steel sheets by resistance spot welding. Aluminum spaceframes will be fabricated mainly by gas metal arc welding (GMAW) with robots. After extensive cooperative development efforts with Alcoa, a major European car company has decided to introduce a spaceframe based aluminum intensive vehicle in the early 90s. Alcoa will be the supplier of the cast and extruded components of this vehicle, as well as a select number of robotically welded subassemblies. At the present time, Alcoa is in the process of constructing a manufacturing plant in Germany, which will produce castings, extrusions and welded subassemblies for automotive aluminum spaceframes. In the plant, the castings and extrusions will be fabri- cated and thermally treated in discrete manufacturing centers from which they will be conveyed to a central surface cleaning facility. After surface cleaning, some of the parts will be moved to the plant's welding assembly line for fabrication of subassemblies and the remaining parts will be shipped to Alcoa's automotive custom- ers. When selecting some of the manufacturing processes and pre- ferred systems' vendors for the plant, a broad and complex range of issues had to be considered through application of a diverse assortment of expertise and perspectives. This was addressed by complementing the conventional qualitative decision- making meth- odology with a refined quantitative decision-making tool. By assist- ing each of the team members in systematically reviewing and ana- lyzing all pertinent considerations and confirming, or substantiating, their individual preferences, a more systematically rationalized col- lective decision-making process resulted. This article presents the principles of the quantitative decision- making approach and illustrates an actual case where it was used to assist in comparing between the laser and the blanking processes, for cutting extrusions in the new plant. This approach, which can be utilized by individuals and teams in a great number of endeavors (e.g., R&amp;D, engineering, sales, purchasing, etc.), has already been applied to selecting a surface cleaning systems supplier, a type of data management system, and the associated software for the plant. 940164. Understanding how molecules permeate through solid substances. L. William Buxton, Peter D. Spohn, and Rod R. Will, DuPont Co. The purpose of this paper is to describe how molecules in a fluid move (permeate) through a solid material. The paper will describe permeation on a molecular level and discuss the general relation- ships between different types of fluids and different forms of solid materials. A general understanding of the behavior of molecules at the fluid/solid interface should be useful to engineers responsible for selecting permeation resistant materials. As specific example, the interaction of various automotive fuel mixtures and fluoropolymer barrier materials will be presented. 940165. Development of multilayer thermoplastic fuel lines with improved barrier properties. Gerhard Hopf and Hans Ries, Hüls, A. G.; and Edward K. Gray, Hüls America. Nylon 12 resins have been utilized for liquid fuel lines in auto- mobiles for more than 25 years. This resin has proven its suitability in monowall tubing in the chassis environment and in contact with normal fuels. The development of more aggressive fuels (mostly those containing alcohol) and the establishment of new hydrocarbon emission standards by various government agencies have change this. 17</page><page sequence="17">940165-940172 In response to the changing situation, multilayer tubing has been developed in order to improve the properties of the nylon 1 2 tubing, primarily the permeation resistance. Hüls has developed two differ- ent constructions, both of which contain a fuel-resistant barrier layer in the wall of the Nylon 12 tubing. One utilizes a barrier layer of a specialty polyester resin with good bonding to the outside and inte- rior layers of Nylon 12 without use of an adhesive. The other utilizes a PVDF resin bonded to the Nylon 12 by an adhesive layer. The results of the addition of these barrier layers are a 10 to 20 fold improvement in permeation resistance compared to Nylon 12 monowall tubing. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940166. ETFE-nylon 12 multi-layer fuel lines and the requirements of a changing fuel line environment. Edward K. Krause and Kenneth J. Kuenzel , Pilot Industries , Inc. Future fuel lines will have to meet far stricter requirements than current nylon 12 fuel lines are capable of meeting. New capability must be added in three areas: 1) permeation resistance, 2) electro- static dissipation, and 3) chemical resistance. Fluoropolymers as a family have emerged as the highest perfor- mance polymers with respect to all three criteria. The drawbacks associated with fluoropolymers have traditionally been: 1) high cost and 2) relatively poor physical properties. The challenge for the fuel systems researcher was to develop a fuel line with the desirable properties of the fluoropolymers without the disadvantages. Further, emulating the desirable performance ' 'fingerprint' ' of nylon 12 around which all current fuel line specifi- cations are written would allow ready acceptance and enable safe and easy substitution. As there is currently no single material that approaches all of these requirements, a composite system is neces- sary. A system that meets all aforementioned criteria has been devel- oped using ETFE as the inner layer with nylon 12 bonded to it as the outer layer. Where electrostatic dissipation is required, two lay- ers of ETFE are used with the innermost being conductive. 940167. Development trends for automotive fluid system con- nections. George Szabo , ITT Automotive. The development of Fluid System Connections, commonly referred to as "Quick Connects", continues as the availability of new engineering thermoplastics, elastomers and greater customer performance requirements drive the development of higher perfor- mance designs. This paper describes some of the areas in which engineering efforts are directed. 940168. Comparison of analysis results to physical testing for the performance of engineering thermoplastic bumper beams. Janet M. Rawson , GE Plastics. Engineering thermoplastics are commonly used in the automo- tive industry as a replacement for steel bumper systems. As the usage of thermoplastics expands in this and other applications, it becomes increasingly desirable to be able to perform preliminary feasibility studies that estimate the performance of the plastic part before tooling is cut. Hence, a study was conducted by GE Plastics in order to correlate the predicted performance of thermoplastic bumper designs via hand calculations and detailed finite-element analyses with results of physical testing. Actual injection-molded thermoplastic bumper beams of a Polycarbonate- Polybutylene Terephtalate alloy were used. This paper will describe the steps used in bumper design, begin- ning with hand calculations and detailed finite-element analysis, compare the results obtained to actual physical testing, and make recommendations on techniques for use in future feasibility studies of thermoplastic bumper systems. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940169. Recycling RIM thermoset polymers into automotive fascia. Roy E. Morgan and Lydia Nemeday, Dow Plastics ; Susan G. Yester and Douglas Peterson, Chrysler Corp.; and Brad Arm- strong, Polyrim Green Lane. The technologies of recycling Reaction Injection Molded (RIM) polyurethane polymers have been refined to the stage of commercial reality. Chrysler Corporation is in the process of qualifying the use of automotive fascia containing recycled RIM thermoset polymers. This will mark the first use, in North America, of a recycled RIM thermoset polymer into a class A surface exterior automotive part. This was made possible through a close working relationship with Polyrim Green Lane, a division of Decoma International, and Dow Plastics. The described process technology allows the recycle of painted and unpainted process scrap, and potentially post consumer scrap, into the same application without the loss of surface quality or polymer performance. This will divert these materials from the waste stream that is currently being landfilled. Described refine- ments included scrap pulverization, the effect of particle size, mois- ture content, and the effect of painted scrap on the polymer's perfor- mance. Details of the three stream RIM process are also discussed. Although there are other alternatives for recycling RIM thermoset polymers, such as chemolysis and hot compression molding, the three stream RIM regrind process holds a potential cost advantage over the other recycle routes. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940171. A comparison of C-shaped and I-type cross-sections for bumpers using compression molded thermoplastics. Christopher Clark and Peter Bejin, GE Plastics. The C-section bumper design has developed through an evolu- tionary process and has come to be regarded as a reasonable geome- try for frontal bumper impacts, especially for use with glass-filled sheet-stampable thermoplastic composite materials. C-section bumpers are now well proven and accepted in the automotive indus- try, performing satisfactorily in a variety of crash situations. A new and more complicated cross-section geometry (I-type with multiple ribbing) has recently been proposed for glass-filled thermoplastic composites. While, in some specialized cases, these highly engineered bumper cross-sections can be useful, they may not perform adequately in all reasonable crash scenarios. Further, it is important to consider manufacturing limitations and the realities of material performance in such complex geometries. Data will be presented to question the practical advantages of the use of ribbed bumper designs over the traditional C-section beam. It will also be shown that when the processing difficulties inherent with these designs are taken into account, the traditional C-section bumper design remains the most logical choice for mass-production vehicle use. 940172. Thermal spray preforms: an economical route to SRIM composites. James H. Barron and James Entringer, Dow Chemical Co. An innovative and economical new method has been developed to fabricate glass fiber preforms in the Structural Reaction Injection Molding (SRIM) process to produce structural composite compo- nents. The method involves blowing a resin powder through a ring of flame in a commercial thermal spray gun to achieve a melt, and directing the melt onto a fiber reinforcement where the polymer solidifies on contact and binds the fibers together. The fibers are fed through a chopper gun and concurrently deposited with the binder onto a screen in the shape of the part. A vacuum is applied to the back of the screen by a blower to hold the fibers in place. The ther- mal spray process has significant economical advantages over the use of mat to fabricate preforms due to lower raw material costs and waste. It also has many advantages over traditional directed fiber processes, including capital and energy savings from the elimination of the preform drying operation. The process is very clean and easily adaptable to robotic operation. Targeted applications include 18</page><page sequence="18">940172-940180 bumper beams, instrument and closeout panels, and seat backs in the automotive market. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940173. Measurement of lateral and torsional rail stiffnesses of vehicle frames for use in prediction thermoplastic bumper performance. Kenneth C. Sherman , GE Plastics. In past physical testing of thermoplastic bumper beams, a large difference in the performance of the bumper on a test cart versus the actual vehicle was found. This difference was large enough to cause concern over the accuracy of testing on test carts to determine part feasibility. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the effect of rail stiffness on bumper beam performance. For this reason, a previous paper discussed a simple method with which to assess the great effect that rail stiffness can have on bumper beam performance. Cur- rently, the only method available to engineers to account for this effect is to model the rail and support bracket in a complex analysis. This technique is time consuming and difficult to use in the prelimi- nary stages of design when it is preferable to use quick hand calcula- tions to rough out part geometry. It would be desirable to develop a simple method to approximate the stiffness of rails in calculations that entail varying degrees of complexity. Hence, it is necessary to take the stiffness of the rails and reduce this parameter to two con- stants-torsional and lateral rail stiffness-that can be used in a vari- ety of calculations. Responding to the need to be able to measure this torsional and lateral rail stiffness data, a mechanism that can measure the stiffness of an arbitrary frame and end-panel geometry has been constructed. The device is portable and can be used in a garage, parking lot, or any other flat area, and enables engineers to obtain the required stiff- ness parameters. This paper will describe the device and instruct engineers on how to use data gathered from testing in simple or complex calculations to predict a bumper performance. 940174. Reduced density RIM fascia with improved impact properties. Brian R. Suddaby, Michael F. Hurley, Bin Lee, and Robert Eiben, Miles, Inc. Reaction Injection Molded (RIM) polyurethanes are well-suited to automotive fascia applications. Their excellent impact resistance, paintability, and styling capabilities are well known. Efforts are underway in the automotive industry to improve the production economics associated with manufacturing RIM faseias. One method of reducing fascia material costs is to reduce the density of the polymer. This paper describes new experimental RIM systems that can be molded at a reduced density, yet still pass current OEM require- ments, including on-car impact tests. These experimental RIM sys- tems combine new filler technology and new resin formulations. The material cost for this system is competitive (based on molded part cost) with all other current methods of manufacturing fascia. 940175. Requirements for vehicle dynamics simulation mod- els. R. Wade Allen and Theodore J. Rosenthal, Systems Technology, Inc. Computer simulation and real-time, interactive approaches for analysis, interactive driving simulation, and hardware-in-the- loop testing are finding increasing application in the research and devel- opment of advanced automotive concepts, highway design, etc. Vehicle dynamics models serve a variety of purposes in simulation. A model must have sufficient complexity for a given application but should not be overly complicated. In interactive driving simulation, vehicle dynamics models must provide appropriate computation for sensory feedback such as visual, motion, auditory, and propriocep- tive cuing. In stability and handling simulations, various modes must be properly represented, including lateral/directional and lon- gitudinal degrees of freedom. Limit performance effects of tire satu- ration that lead to plow out, spin out, and skidding require adequate tire force response models. Additional steering and braking sub- system characterizations are necessary to represent important han- dling and stability requirements. Steering compliance and appropri- ate tire aligning torque effects provide a significant component of understeer. Front-to-rear brake proportioning plays a significant role in limit performance directional stability, including the effects of nonlinear brake pressure proportioning valves. This paper summarizes vehicle dynamics model requirements for various classes of interactive and computer simulations. General formulations include sets of force and moment equations, with sub- sidiary equations for effects such as tire force response, antilock, traction control, four-wheel steering, and other advanced vehicle control systems (AVCS). Examples of simple and complex models will be given, including validation methods, for vehicle and driver models. 940176. The Ford driving simulator. Jeffry A. Greenberg and Thomas J. Park, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes the design and development of the Ford Driving Simulator. The simulator is a fixed-base device which pro- vides real-time, interactive feedback to the driver through a combi- nation of visual, auditory and tactile cues. The system is comprised of a modular buck, 150° field-of-view visual scene, a steering torque controller, high fidelity dynamics models, and an interactive experi- menters station. Data acquisition systems have been developed to capture a broad spectrum of drive performance metrics. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940178. Real-time wheel brake and tire lateral force models refined for low speeds. Ken J. Whatmough, University of Toronto. This paper discusses the development of a model of wheel brake force and tire lateral force for real-time, human-in-the-loop simula- tion running on a relatively slow computer. The model is refined to avoid numerical instabilities in the vehicle's equations of motion, especially at zero and very low forward speeds. The result is a com- putationally inexpensive algorithm to approximate the model's behavior including its transient response. The performance of this model is compared to published data for actual tires, and preliminary results from its implementation in a piloted flight simulator are discussed. 940179. The General Motors driving simulator. Gary P. Ber- tollini, Charles M. Johnston, James W. Kuiper, James C. Kukuļa, Małgorzata, A. Kulczycka, and William E. Thomas, General Motors Corp. A driving simulator development project at the Systems Engi- neering and Technical Process Center (SE/TP) is exploring the role of driving simulation in the vehicle design process. The simulator provides two vehicle mockup testing arenas that support a wide field of view, computer-generated image of the road scene which dynam- ically responds to driver commands as a function of programmable vehicle model parameters. Two unique aspects of the simulator are the fast 65 ms response time and low incidence rate of simulator induced syndrome (about 5). Preliminary model validation results and data comparing driver performance in a vehicle versus the simulator indicate accurate han- dling response dynamics within the on-center handling region (&lt;0.3g lateral acceleration). Applications have included supporting the development of new steering system concepts, as well as evaluating the usability of vehi- cle controls and displays. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940180.

Design analysis of an electronically-controlled hydraulic braking system using the Saber Simulator. Mike Don- nely, Craig Siegel, and Dale Witt, Analogy, Inc. An electronically controlled hydraulic pressure regulator, that could be used in an automotive or aircraft "brake-by- wire" system, is analyzed using the Saber® Simulator. The design incorporates electrical, mechanical and hydraulic elements. The entire dynamic system is modeled, including the interactions between the hydraulic and electrical components. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify key parameters affecting performance, and stress analysis indicates components that are operating near or above rated values. These simulation techniques are applicable to a broad range of dynamic systems, especially those containing multiple technologies that must work together to accomplish the overall design objectives. The method supports the concept of interdisciplinary design teams, by providing enhanced communication among engineering special- ists. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940185. DSP-based automotive sensor signal generation for hardware-in-the-loop simulation. Herbert Hanselmann, dSPACE GmbH. Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation is a technology where the actual vehicles, engines or other components are replaced by a real- time simulation in a simulation computer, based on a mathematical model. That simulation reads ECU (Electronic Control Unit) output signals which would normally go to actuators. On the other hand the simulation must output the sensor signals which make the ECU 'think' it controls a real system. Generating these signals can be very difficult. Signals may be complex, depend on on-line computed variables, and be required to be output at high timing resolution. This paper describes the problems and presents a solution which employs high-performance Digital Signal Processors (DSP) to gen- erate such signals on-line by Direct-Digital-Synthesis (DDS). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940187. New TPO and coating technology for bumper with- out 1.1.1-trichloroethane. Yasunori Komatsu, Junji Kamimura, and Osamu Aoki, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Dennis B. Chung, and Michel S. Wiseman, Honda R&amp;D North America. Thermo plastic olefin (TPO) for automotive bumper has poor paintability and 1.1.1-trichloroethane vapor treatment is applied in order to improve the paintability. 1.1.1-trichloroethane has the func- tion of not only degreasing, but also it etches and swells the sub- strate. This paper introduces an alternative technology of modified TPO substrate with functional group which was newly developed. Also developed were a waterborne primer and aqueous based cleaning to show effect on specially TPO without the use of 1.1.1- trichloroethane which will be phased out by the end of 1995 to meet the Montreal Protocol. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940188. (SP- 1026) Characterization of the transient spray form a high pressure swirl injector. Lawrence W. Ever s , Michigan Technological Univ. The project is intended to characterize the transient spray from a high pressure swirl injector. The spray regions were identified as the leading edge, cone, trailing edge, and vortex cloud. Each region was influenced somewhat differently by changes in the operational parameters. Increasing the ambient chamber pressure increased the droplet size in all regions of the spray. Increasing the fluid pressure reduced the droplet size in all regions of the spray, except for the vortex cloud. Increasing the swirl of the fluid leaving the fiiel injec- tor increased the size of the droplets in the leading edge and cone region. 940190. (SP- 1026) Analogy between atomization and vapor- ization based on the conservation of energy. Lawrence W. Evers, Michigan Technological Univ. An analogy is presented which descries the similarity between atomization and vaporization based on the conservation of energy. Many of the classic principles of ideal vaporization are shown to apply equally well to ideal atomization. The analogy provides a basis to evaluate atomization processes, systems involving atomiza- tion, and efficiencies of atomization devices. An example presents the calculation of various atomization parameters, including atom- ization efficiency. 940191. (SP- 1026) Study on atomization and fuel drop site distribution in direct injection diesel spray. Hoang Xuan Quoc and Maurice Brun, Ecole Centrale de Lyon. Diverse techniques have been developed for spray investigations, especially high speed cinematography and microphotography. Recently, the progresses obtained in the application of laser tech- niques to simultaneous measurement of droplet size and velocity have opened new perspectives for in situ investigations of diesel fuel jets. In this study, a laser measuring system, based on the Phase Doppler Anemometry method (PDA), is applied to examine the dynamic behavior of the fuel jet in an experimental direct injection diesel engine fitted with large optical accesses. The local measure- ments have been performed for two cases: with combustion and without combustion. The experimental set-up and the elaboration of a procedure for both data acquisition and treatment allow investiga- tions about different aspects of fuel spray such as the nature of atom- ization process, the influence of injection conditions (advance of injection and injected fuel quantity) and the spatial and time- resolved evolution of droplet diameters in the combustion chamber. Finally, the experimental data about fuel droplets have been exploited in order to specify drop size distribution laws. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940192. (SP- 1026) Spray characteristics of five-hole V.C.O. nozzles of a diesel electro-injector. R. Campanella, D. Laforgia, and A. Ficarella, Instituto di Macchine ed Energetica ; and V. Dami- ani, and M. Ricco, ELASIS. The study of the spray of standard, five-hole, V.C.O. nozzles for D.I. diesel engine has been carried out. Several pictures of the spray have been taken using the back-light photography technique. Injected volume, feeding pressure, injection duration, spray penetra- tion, angle and thickness, and flash delay from the start of injection have been measured both for nozzles of two different manufacturers and for a group of four injectors before and after a fatigue test of about 1,500 hours running. Measurements revealed that each spray strongly depends on the needle lift, the back-pressure and the nozzle geometry and that, for the same injector, sprays are totally different from hole to hole. The causes of the most important differences have been attributed at the different hole inclination, their asymmetric feeding conditions (due to the eccentricity between needle and noz- zle) and the microdefects caused by drilling operation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940193. (SP- 1026) Diesel electro-injector: a numerical simu- lation code. P. Digesù, A. Ficarella, and D. Laforgia, instituto di Macchine ed Energetica; and G. Bruni, and M. Ricco, ELASIS. A simulation code of an electro-injector for diesel engines is presented with the preliminary parametric analysis carried out with the code. The simulation code is based upon the concentrated vol- ume method as for the chambers of the system. Energy and flow rate conservation equations and dynamic equations are used for the mov- able parts of the system under stress or friction. The magnetic force acting on the electro-injector actuator has been calculated by means of a Finite element simulation. The one-dimensional code simulated 20</page><page sequence="20">940193-940200 the propagation in feeding pipes and the control of the electro- injector. The program, in fact, uses the method of the characteristic equations to solve conservation equations, simulating the propaga- tion in a pipe between two chambers. The sensitivity analysis has pointed out that the parameters which are influenced by the propagation in the pipes are: needle lift, injected flow-rate, pressure in each chamber and volume. The per- turbations reduce the effective pressure of injection and are influ- enced by pipe lengths and diameters. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940194. (SP- 1026) Recent progress in rate shaping technol- ogy for diesel in-line pumps. Hiroshi Ishiwata, Xin-he Li, Hideaki Yoshikawa, and Nobuhiro Kitahara, Zexel Corp. Simultaneous reductions in NOx, combustion noise and particu- late (PM) are required in future diesel engines. In order to satisfy this, rate shaping technology is a key factor in fuel injection system design. This paper describes firstly the latest status of high pressure injection in In-line pump-line-nozzle systems. The effect of smaller nozzle orifice application will be explained, commenting on a reduction in ignition delay period and NOx emission. Secondly, recent progress in rate shaping technology will be reported. Characteristics of a concave cam profile and an oblong- shaped spill port will be explained. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940195. (SP- 1026) A feasibility study of pilot injection in TICS (Timing and Injection rate Control System). Hiroshi Ishi- wata, Takashi Ohishi, Kotaro Ryuzaki, Ken Unoki, and Nobuhiro Kitahara, Zexel Corp. This paper describes the development status of TICS pilot injec- tion. Stable pilot injection with an appropriate pilot injection quan- tity and pilot-main injection interval can be obtained by the newly introduced pilot injection element in TICS. A single cylinder NÁ engine has been tested to clarify the effect of pilot injection. The results show the advantages of pilot injection for NOx, HC, BSFC and noise reduction. The pilot quantity is required to be as small as possible in order to minimize the penalty in smoke emission. Finally, the latest results of the feasibility study of TICS pilot injec- tion are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940196. A new multi-impingement-wall head diffusion com- bustion system (NICS-MH) of a DI diesel engine. Masaru Ogura and Bai-fu Lin, Nippon Institute of Technology. Fuel injected from multi-hole injector with a small injection angle (100°) is impinged to the multi-impingement- wall head (MIW head), which is located in the center of combustion chamber and is attached to the cylinder head. The fuel is diffused into the piston cavity to form a three-dimensional diffusion spray. The main advan- tage of diffusion spray is that the effects of the fuel impinging diffu- sion and the collision between fuel particles can be obtained. Based on the concept of MIW head, the experimental results show that the combustion performance and the fuel consumption have been improved. Besides, the NOx, HC and smoke densities of the exhaust gas of a diesel engine have been reduced. 940197. (SP- 1038) Intercooled-supercharged gas generator engine. Lin-Shu Wang, Intercool Development, Ltd.; and Cheng -Ta Chung, State University of New York. The significant fuel-economy gain that may be achieved from the application of ceramic materials to the piston engine technology requires practical and reliable exhaust heat recovery means. Such a means has so far eluded the engine technology community. The "add-on" bottoming cycles to the traditional piston engines based on Otto cycle and diesel cycle are totally impractical. By con- trast, steam injection has been effectively applied to gas turbine (electric generator) systems with significant increase in power out- put and thermal efficiency. The steam-injected gas turbine has been increasingly adopted in power production, and can be regarded as a mature technology. The questions then arises as to whether steam injection can be used for piston-type engines in transportation. Gas generator engines - which have been investigated as experi- mental engines for many years - may be one of the piston-type engines ideally suited for practical heat recovery. The traditional gas generator engine, however, is inferior in performance to the com- mon piston engines. A new cycle principle for gas generator engines was proposed by Wang and Jeng (1992). In this paper, a zero- dimensional compute simulation is used to demonstrate that the intermittent-combustion gas generator engine based on the proposed intercooling-supercharging cycle principle can match the perfor- mance of the best of diesel engines, equal in thermal efficiency, and greatly superior in specific power output. The intercooled-supercharged gas generator engine is, therefore, an attractive candidate for the future adaptation of injected-steam. The resulting gas generator engine may be expected to be excep- tional in both specific power output and thermal efficiency. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940198. (SP- 1038) Development of V6 Miller Cycle gasoline engine. Tsuyoshi Goto, Koichi Hatamura, Shinobu Takizawa, Nobuhiro Hay ama, and Hiroshi Abe, Mazda Motor Corp.; and Hiroshi Kane saka, Kane saka Technical Institute, Ltd. A gasoline engine with an entirely new combustion cycle deriv- ing from Miller Cycle is developed. By delaying closing timing of intake valve and with new Lysholm Compressor which provides higher boost pressure, engine knocking is avoided which high com- pression ratio is maintained and approximately 1.5 times larger torque than that of a naturally aspirated (NA) engine of the same dis- placement is realized. This V6 Miller Cycle gasoline engine can be the alternative to a larger displacement NA engine because of its equivalent torque performance and its lower fuel consumption by the effect of smaller displacement. 940199. (SP- 1038) The 2&amp;2-stroke cycle engines. Miin, J. Yan, Two &amp; 2-Stoke Engines. The new 2&amp;2-stoke cycle engine completes 4 strokes in every re volutin by a 2-part piston - the piston cap and piston body. The light piston cap performs the exhaust/intake strokes separetely through a light operating mechamism and the heavy compression/ combustion strokes jointly with the piston body. Furthermore the 2&amp;2-cycle allows differential strokes in displacements and periods. Completing the 4 strokes the 2&amp;2-cycle inherits from the 4- cycle the exhaust characteristics that are amiable to current emmis- sion treatments. Yet having a combustion in every revolution the 2&amp;2-cycle produces torque like a 2-cycle. Developing the 2&amp;2- cycle is cost-effective as it shares the same know-how and most hardware with the popular 4-cycle. This article describes the 2&amp;2-cycle technology and its promises and challenges. 940200. (SP- 1038) A practical recirculating spark ignition power plant Stephen P. Hendrickson and Benjamin Russ, Aurora Flight Sciences Corp. An exhaust gas recirculating power plant has been developed using an existing lightweight spark ignition four-stroke engine. Application is a remotely piloted unmanned aircraft for global envi- ronmental research at very high altitudes. The engine uses gasoline and oxygen as reactants. Liquid oxygen is carried in a cryogenic tank on board of the aircraft. Mass balance is maintained through a waste gate in the loop. A specially tailored electronic engine man- agement system had to be developed to control fuel injection, oxy- gen metering and ignition timing. Additional control parameters are the waste gate to control the loop pressure and the aerodynamic cooling flaps on the cooling ram air side of the exhaust gas heat exchanger to control the air charge temperature. The advantages of this control scheme are the manifold pressure and the ratio of reactant to diluent can be held at any desired level, independent of atmospheric conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 21</page><page sequence="21">940201-940207 940201. (SP- 1038) Examination of the factors that influence the durability of railplugs. J. P. Chiù , M. H. Darden , R. D. Mat- thews, H. E. Childs, R. W. Faidley, J. Zheng, G. Weigand, W. F. Weldon, and S. P. Nichols, University of Texas. A new type of ignitor, the railplug, shows promise of extending the dilution limits for spark ignition engines. While much of the effort expended in our study of railplugs has focused upon demon- strating their effectiveness, it is recognized that railplug durability is presently not acceptable for production engine applications. The goal of the present study was to examine the factors that affect dura- bility. The results of two types of investigations are reported. The effects of rail materials, pressure, delivered energy, and voltage at constant delivered energy on electrode erosion rates were studied for repeated firings in air at constant pressure. Railplug durability in a four-stroke SI engine was also evaluated, including examination of the effects of delivered energy, current pulse characteristics, and materials. This research was not intended to demonstrate improved railplug durability, but rather was intended to develop information to guide future efforts to improve railplug durability. The erosion rate studies showed 1) that several materials are promising candi- dates for center rails, and 2) that use of a high voltage firing circuit should significantly improve durability. The engine tests used a low voltage firing circuit and 1) indicated that future durability tests should be done using the capacitance that results in fastest combus- tion, 2) reaffirmed that decreased delivered energies increase dura- bility, and 3) isolated two separate failure mechanisms that depend upon the delivered energy, with the division appearing to be a deliv- ered energy in the range of 1.0-1.4 J. It is concluded that future efforts to improve railplug durability should focus upon 1) addi- tional studies of center rail materials, 2) use of a high voltage firing circuit, 3) the lower delivered energy levels, and 4) most impor- tantly, improved railplug geometries. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940202. (SP-1038) Cut-off control: a promising method of load regulation in spark ignition engine. M. M. Youssef Abdalla, Minia Univ. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of the effect of cut-off control on engine performance. Cut-off control is an alternative method of load regulation in spark ignition engine. During cut-off operation, the charge is admitted at wide open throt- tle, hence the inlet charge passage is to be shut down before the completion of intake stroke. Cut-off is to be attained by means of an additional rotary valve mounted in series with the conventional inlet valve. The study indicates that cut-off control can provide a significant improvement in fuel economy. The effect of some important design parameters is also considered. 940203. (SP-1038) Joining of SÌ3N4 Turbine rotor and metal shaft. Hisao Takeuchi and Akira Yamakawa, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. The joining process of silicon nitride (SÍ3N4) turbine rotor and steel metal shaft was investigated. The process consists of brazing procedures with multi-layer metallizing and complementary steps involving shrink fitting and non-destructive tests. In the course of the brazing steps, preliminary investigations using small specimens were conducted on the formation of a highly strengthened interface at high temperature and thermal stress reduc- tion, and superior high temperature strength and heat cycle resis- tance were obtained. Rotary tests at high temperature were successfully completed using the rotor joined by this process. 940204. (SP-1038) Axial internal combustion engine - Practical prospects for the future. V Kutenev, Y. Romanchev, and M. Zlenko, NAMI. Reduction of fuel consumption and dangerous emissions remains one of the most important problems in the automobile industry. It is necessary not only to find ways of lowering harmful influence of automobile on the environment but also to make maximum efforts to reduce ecological pressure on nature, resulting particularly due to C02 emissions, during the whole care manufacturing cycle, beginning with ore output and processing and ending with ready- made car leaving the plant's conveyor. Increasingly rigid car toxic- ity and effectiveness standards stimulate the search for new solu- tions and a critical analysis of old one which in the past could not be put into practice. Among the latter is the idea of piston displacement control, which in our opinion is the greatest and practically still untapped reserve of increasing engine efficiency. Till now this area lacks proper attention of both science and industry though arguments in favor of piston displacement control have long been sufficiently convincing and never questioned by anyone. These arguments are widely known; elimination (or reduc- tion) of throttling, reduction of friction losses and, as a consequence, a drop in mechanical losses, a gain in indicator and mechanical effi- ciency, reduction of fuel consumption and dangerous emissions. The final result depends on a way of achieving piston displacement control. 940205. Geometric parameters of four-valve cylinder heads and their relationship to combustion and engine full load perfor- mance. Jose ' F. Regueiro, Regueiro Engine Technologies ; and Salo J. Korn, Chrysler Corp. Mathematical relationships are established between valve sizes, valve included angle (VIA) and bore diameter for four- valve pen- troof chambers. Graphical results show the effects of these relation- ships on geometric breathing capacity and links them to cylinder displacement, rated speed, bore/stroke ratio, intake valve lift, and intake exhaust valve diameter ratio. A ''geometric engine" mathe- matical model relates these parameters to combustion chamber sur- face to volume ratio and easily determines the piston top configura- tion. Current production engines are analyzed to produce relation- ships between these geometric parameters and full load perfor- mance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940206. Study of intake system wave dynamics and acoustics by simulation and experiment. John J. Silvestri and Thomas Morel, Ricardo North America; and Michael Costello, General Motors Corp. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the com- parison between measured and simulated intake system dynamics of the General Motors Quad 4 engine. Simulations of the engine were conducted at eleven wide-open-throttle operating conditions ranging in engine speed from 2500 rpm to 6000 rpm under both fir- ing and motoring operation. Comparisons of basic engine perfor- mance (torque, volumetric efficiency, BSFC), as well as dynamic pressure at two locations within the intake manifold (runner and ple- num) showed good correlation between measurements and simula- tion. The total sound pressure level radiated from the intake orifice was also calculated and compared to measured data. The results of this study show that the simulation program has the ability to accu- rately capture the major features of engine intake system wave dynamics, including amplitude, phasing, and excitation of system resonances throughout the engine operating range. Thus, it may be used early in the design stage to develop intake and exhaust systems optimized for maximum engine performance as well as minimum radiated noise levels and superior sound quality. 940207. Concurrent simulation and testing concept in engine development. Thomas Morel and Leon A. LaPointe, Ricardo North America. The use of engine simulation is rapidly increasing throughout the engine industry. In the present paper, the major contributing factors which drive this trend are discussed. These include the increasing sophistication of the simulations, both in the area of high accuracy and in user-friendliness. Also, the decreasing cost of engineering computer workstations places them on the desktop of engineers and 22</page><page sequence="22">940207-940213 makes them readily available. Furthermore, the steadily rising com- puter processing power now provides the response needed in the engine development environment. The advances seen in simulations now open a new area for their applications - as a tool fully complementary to test and measure- ment in a "concurrent test and simulation" process. The wide- ranging benefits and opportunities offered by the process are described in detail 940208. A new model for fuel supply dynamics in an SI engine. Raymond C. Turin , Ernesto G. B. Casartelli, and Hans P. Geering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH). In this paper we introduce an improved model for the fuel supply dynamics in an SI engine. First, we briefly investigate all the thermodynamic phenomena which are assumed to have a significant impact on fuel flow into the cylinder (i.e., fuel atomization, droplet decay, wall- wetting, film evaporation, and mixture flow back). This theoretical analysis results in a basic set of dynamic equations. Unfortunately, these equations are not convenient to use for control purposes. Therefore, we proceed to a simplified formulation. Several unknown parame- ters remain, describing phenomena which are difficult to quantify, such as heat and material transfer characteristics. These parameters are subject to operating conditions and are not discussed further. In order to validate the model dynamics, we refer to frequency and step response measurements performed on 4-cylinder, 1.8 liter BMW engine with sequential fuel injection. From the frequency response measurement we first extract the time constants of the oxygen sensor used throughout the experi- ments. Provided with these parameters we investigate the transient behavior of the model due to both steps in air and in fuel supply. In order to vary fuel supply we control injection time, whereas air supply variations are generated by controlling the throttle set point. For this purpose, the amount of air residing in the cylinder is calcu- lated according to intake manifold pressure, thereby eliminating intake manifold dynamics. We verify that the model proposed is sufficient to describe most of the dynamic phenomena in fuel supply. 940209. Tractor diesel engine performance under variable loading. A. A. Golverk, Moshe Sharet. The new method for calculation of engine performance charac- teristics under variable loading is developed. It is shown, that the increase in values of the torque fluctuations results in corresponding increase in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and reduc- tion of the engine effective power. Also, the regulator characteristics for both normal and extreme regimes of the engine operation are obtained. These regimes are characterized by the values of the torque variation coefficient 15% and 30%, respectively. The differ- ence between regulator characteristics under variable loading and those obtained within the test bed runs under constant loads are illustrated. The method for development of the relative operation character- istic plotted in a non-dimensional coordinates is proposed. It is use- ful for comparison between the performance characteristics of dif- ferent engines, since their operation characteristics are plotted onto the same diagram. The appropriate equations for calculation of the BSFC increase and the engine effective power reduction with variation of the torque variation coefficient within the test bed runs are derived. 940210. Optimal design of the intake system in 4-s.i.c.e. Rafael Royo, José Corberán, and Antonio Pérez , Universidad Poli- técnica de Valencia. This article sets global rules for the design of the different ele- ments of the intake system for a wide range of 4-s.i.c.e., examining the different phenomena related with the gas exchange process. With this objective, a broad analysis of a set of very different auto- motive engines was carried out, using a full wave action model developed by this same research group and widely checked by com- parison with experimental results. The design criteria presented in the paper have been extensively and successfully applied in different development projects carried out for several automotive engine companies. 940211. Numerical simulation of the turbulent combustion process in a rapid compression device. U. Bielert, M. Klug, and G. Adomeit, Institut Für Allgemeine Mechanik. The combustion process in a compression apparatus with rectan- gular cross section is simulated using a front tracking technique. The numerical model allows to trace the movement of the flame zone in time and space allowing the flame to change its shape and posi- tion. A two-dimensional calculation of the flow field and the flame propagation is combined with a zero dimensional calculation of thermodynamic quantities. An entrainment model is applied, crev- ices are taken into account. The influence of the turbulence intensity on flame propagation is modeled by the turbulent flame speed for which an expression is given. Results of numerical calculations are given for different turbulence intensities. The results of these simu- lations are compared with experimental data. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940212. The analysis of a constant depression carburetor with a fuel feeder. B. Sendyka, University of Durban-W estville; and W. Heydel, Technical University of Cracow. This work conducts an analysis of the advantages coming from application of the constant depression carburetor with a fuel feeder. The fuel feeder enables an automatic change of the dynamic characteristic to the economic characteristic of the carburetor. The computer analysis of the characteristic of the constant depression carburetor was conducted based on a mathematical model. The com- parison was made between the prototype of the constant depression carburetor and a standard one. The greatest advantages are for the partial loads of an engine. The fuel consumption was decreased by about 18% comparing to the standard carburetor. The additional advantage of a constant depression carburetor is the automatic change of its economic characteristic to dynamic one during the work of an engine. 940213. Computation of the in-cylinder processes of a natu- ral gas engine. Zhiyu Han, Keh C. Tsao, and M. M. Youssef Abdalla, University of Wisconsin. Multidimensional computations were carried out on a spark- ignition natural gas engine with a bowl-in-piston combustion cham- ber. The engine in-cylinder flow distributions and their effects on combustion are examined. The fact that the engine swirl would speed up the combustion process is confirmed due to the enhance- ment of turbulent diffusion process. The engine squish increases both the mean velocity and the turbulence intensity of the gas flow and, therefore, quickens the combustion process. The computations indicate further that the engine swirl impacts the engine in-cylinder flow fields more profoundly than the engine squish does. When the piston bowl is offset, the in-cylinder gas motion can be enhanced considerably. Computations were also made to study the sensitivity of the computed cylinder pressure history to initial values of the selected thermodynamic parameters and chosen initial turbulence conditions. Two approaches to initialize the turbulence length scale at the beginning of computation were examined and compared. It is found that the variations of the initial turbulent kinetic energy could lead to significant changes of the pressure history when turbu- lence length scale is initialized to be uniform throughout the cylin- der. However, the pressure history is much less sensitive to the vari- ations of the initial turbulent kinetic energy when turbulence length scale is initialized to be proportional to the distance to the nearest solid wall. 23</page><page sequence="23">940214-940220 940214. The analysis of the dynamic contact stresses occur- ring in the valve-camshaft system of the internal combustion engine. B. Sendyka, University of Durban-Westville. The work analyzes the dynamic contact stresses, taking into the consideration shear stress occurring between the cam and the fol- lower in the valve-camshaft system of a high speed engine. After calculating the dynamic and friction forces as the function of the rotational speed of an engine, the method of calculating contact stresses is presented. The results of calculations are also presented as a function of angle of rotation of the camshaft. In the dynamic model the effect of the rebound phenomenon on the instantaneous increase of Hertzian stresses was considered. The places of the potential damage of the surfaces of the cams are listed. The results of the analysis are presented as a function of the angle of rotation of the camshaft for the varying speeds of an engine. The maximum permissible speed of an engine was determined, above which the allowable contact stresses are exceeded. At the end of this paper the proposal of changing the cam shape of the camshaft is presented, so that to allow the increase in the max- imum allowable rotational speed of an engine. This can be done without increasing the stiffness of springs, which allows us to main- tain the same (not increased) contact stresses at the increased rota- tional speed of an engine. 940215. Study about burned gas fraction and its relationship with engine performance at low loads. José Corberán, Antonio Pérez, and Rafael Royo , Universidad Politécnica de Valencia. In this paper the results and main conclusions of a study concern- ing BGF at low loads, its relationship with valve timing and load, and its influence on engine instability and emissions, are presented. The study covered a wide range of load and valve timings for both intake and exhaust valves. Measured values of engine perfor- mance, emissions and instability were used. BGF was estimated by a global engine code based on a full wave action model. The good correlation found between calculated BGF with mea- sured parameters proves the capability of wave action models to pre- dict the influence of design modifications on engine performance at low loads. A very interesting relationship, found among BGF, volumetric efficiency, IVO and permeability is presented. As well, the relation- ship between BGF and manifold pressure, with engine instability and NOx emissions are discussed and a correction of the manifold pressure which describes very well both aspects of engine perfor- mance is presented. 940216. (SP- 1034) Development of a lateral acceleration com- pensating seat. Steven T. Gamache, Lear Seating Corp. An automatically articulating seat which compensates for lateral acceleration has been developed. The seat provides additional lateral support by moving seat torso bolsters towards the occupant. The support is provided on the side needed and can accommodate any size occupant. This additional lateral support during cornering reduces fatigue and enhances comfort. The activation and deactiva- tion thresholds can be adjusted to any desired setting. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940217. (SP- 1034) Benchmarking seat comfort. Virginia A. Runkle , Lear Seating Corp. Seat comfort is a very subjective issue because it is the customer who makes the final determination. Furthermore, customer evalua- tions are based on their opinions having experienced the seat, not on objective measurements of a seat. The challenge for seat suppli- ers is to develop effective methods for translating customer opinions into physical seat characteristics. This paper describes Lear's Seat Comfort Benchmarking methodology which incorporates and inte- grates four tools into a single comprehensive seat comfort analysis; Market Research studies, Benchmarking studies, Body Pressure Distribution analyses and Human Factors studies of anthropometric data. 940218. (SP- 1034) Integrated restraint seat with composite frame. John C. Wainwright, Lear Seating Corp.; Larry Verellen, TRW Vehicle Safety Systems, Inc.; and Pat Glance, Concept Analy- sis Corp. An Integrated Restraint Seat (1RS) improves occupant protec- tion, comfort, ease of rear seat ingress and egress, and eliminates special restraint packaging issues normally associated with convert- ible top vehicles. Two years ago, seven companies formed a Consortium which is now known as the Lear Seat Consortium. The goal of the Consor- tium is to provide cost and mass effective Integral Restraint Seats. A Composite seat frame consisting of high modulus metal stabi- lized by low modulus plastic results in a low mass, cost effective seat. A unique insert extrusion blow molding process is utilized to form the composite structure. This paper describes the design, materials, process, load criteria, structural analysis and testing of the composite 1RS. 940219. (SP- 1034) MDI-based polyurethane foam for low- density automotive seating. V. S. Murty, ICI Polyur ethanes. A unique low density, water-blown MDI polyurethane foam chemistry has been developed for U.S. Automotive Seating. This breakthrough technology is competitive with incumbent TDI seating systems and can be processed in existing production tools and machinery. Contrary to previously available MDI-based products, this new technology yields densities and Indentation Load Deflec- tions (ILDs) equivalent to what is commonly available with TDI. In addition, a wide firmness range can be achieved by merely changing index, thus eliminating the need for more expensive filled polyols, and multiple systems. A single MDI system can thus be used to pro- duce seat backs, cushions, and dual firmness parts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940220. (SP- 1034) Recycling benefits of pour-in-place molded seat technology versus traditional cut and sew technology. Larry Demoe and Ed Nichols, Magna International. Preservation of the environment has been recognized as an important criterion by which to measure the impact of our activities in the Automotive Industry. Solid waste is a concern with process scrap from production of parts for new vehicles, and with any mate- rial sent to landfill after the old vehicles are scrapped at the end of their useful lives. There are significant technical hurdles inherent in the recycling of vehicles on the road today since yesterday's designs did not consider the concept of recyclability. These hurdles should disappear in future automobiles as design for recycling or disassem- bly becomes a key priority. Recent studies have shown that post-consumer automotive seat- ing foam can be used to produce good quality bonded underlayment. A substantial and viable market currently exists for scrap polyure- thane flexible foam. More than 220 thousand metric tons per year of polyurethane flexible foam are used to produce quality carpet underlayment for wall-to wall carpeting. Reduction of ASR (Automotive Shredder Residue) can be accomplished by selective removal of polymers prior to the shred- ding process. Traditional cut and sew seat technology uses embed- ded wires and rods, as well as velcro, staples and hog rings to fabri- cate vehicle seats. This technology makes it difficult and time con- suming to economically recover usable flexible foam. The study presented here contrasts recovery of materials from Pour-In-Place (PIP) automotive seating produced using MDI-based polyurethane flexible foam technology with traditional Cut and Sew (CAS) tech- nology. Disassembly, labor, and amounts of foam recovered from seats produced using CAS and PIP technologies are presented, and implications for viable recycling technologies reviewed. 24</page><page sequence="24">940221-940227 940221. (SP- 1034) PURRC flexible foam task group: recy- cling automotive seating an update. John J. Quinlan, Arco Chemi- cal Co. Today, automobiles exemplify how plastics can provide signifi- cant benefits to designers, manufacturers, and end-users. At the same time, vehicles today embody the environmental questions con- fronting the automotive manufacturer and the material supplier. Can our vehicles be recycled or recovered at the end of their service lives, and how can these products be effectively and efficiently reclaimed? The PolyUrethanes Recycle &amp; Recovery Council (PURRC) was founded in September 1990, a unit of the Polyurethane Division of the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc. to help answer these ques- tions. PURRC' s mission is to identify commercially viable technol- ogies for recycling and/or recovering polyurethanes to promote fea- sible recovery technologies and to communicate that polyurethane products are recyclable and recoverable. This paper reviews the steps that the polyurethane industry is tak- ing to provide the automotive industry with answers to the recycle/ recovery issue. One of PURRC' s initial foci has been recovering polyurethane foam from automotive seating. PURRC conducted a pilot dismantling project to examine the economics and infrastructure requirements for removing flexible foam from post consumer car seats at the dismantler level. The recovered foam was provided to a manufacturer who was able to incorporate up to 100% of the recovered foam into commercial car- pet underlay. To investigate new end uses, recovered foam was also cryogeni- cally ground and used in a pilot scale trial, where up to approxi- mately 20% of the foam was added to the production of slabstock, currently used in automotive seating and furniture. Other studies and results covered include: an evaluation of cur- rent available technologies to separate polyurethane flexible foam from automotive shredder residue; a combustion trial to study the recovery of energy from polyurethane flexible foam in a commercial municipal solid waste facility; evaluation of methods to recycle polyurethane foam from automotive instrument panels; and new end use markets for recovered polyurethanes. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940223. (SP- 101 6) Dynamic tire modeling for application with vehicle simulations incorporating terrain. Dan Negrut and Jeffrey S. Freeman, University of Iowa. The purpose of this study is to improve predicted tire forces for vehicle simulations on off-road terrain and for simulations incorpo- rating terrain features such as curbs, pavement markers or potholes. The model presented in this paper describes the longitudinal behav- ior of the tire for traversing high-fidelity terrain profiles. An extended rolling radial-interradial tire model is used to estimate the pressure distribution of the tire contact patch, while a tangential spring model of the tire carcass is used to estimate tractive forces at the tire/road interface. Due to the complexity of the model real- time simulation is not possible, however it is useful for off-line sim- ulations incorporating rough terrain or short-wavelength terrain fea- tures. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940224. (SP- 101 6) The effects of roll control for passenger cars during emergency maneuvers. Christopher J. Constantine and E. Harry Law, Clemson Univ. A nonlinear eight degree of freedom vehicle model has been used to examine the effects of roll stiffness on handling and performance. In addition, various control strategies have been devised which vary the total roll couple distribution in order to improve cornering capa- bility and stopping distance. Of all cases tested, a controller which varies the total roll stiff- ness based on roll angle feedback, and continuously updates the roll couple distribution as a function of steering wheel angle, braking input, and the total roll stiffness, yields the greatest improvements in collision avoidance. 940225. (SP- 1016) Methodology for tripped vehicle rollover testing and analysis of experimental results. Andrzej G. Nalecz, University of Missouri; and Zhengyu Lu, Vehicle Dynamics Interna- tional. This paper presents the results from an experimental project involving the full-scale testing of vehicles in a variety of maneuvers. The maneuvers include tripped rollover maneuvers resulting from impacts of eight test vehicles with both soil and curb pavement dis- continuities. The reduced data from experimental tests form the impact condition variables which are augmented with vehicle design parameters in the analysis of results. The data are analyzed in data- sets created according to such criteria as maneuver type, maneuver result, and type of terrain discontinuity. These results are investi- gated on the basis of mean values and coefficients of correlation. Results throughout the study support the conclusion that soil- tripped rollover maneuvers are qualitatively different than curb- tripped rollover maneuvers. The results obtained confirm that imple- mentation of anti-lock braking systems and traction control systems reduces a risk of rollover when vehicle encounters a terrain disconti- nuity. Also covered is the processing of experimental results into a form suitable for computer simulation validation and the analysis of vehicle rollover behavior based upon obtained results. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940226. (SP- 101 6) Effects of outrigger design on vehicle dynamics. Charles P. Dicker son, Stephen M. Arndt, Gregory A. Mowry, and Mark W. Arndt, Arndt &amp; Associates, Ltd. Outriggers are devices that arrest vehicle rollover during han- dling test maneuvers to protect the test vehicle and/or test driver. Validity of data in these tests has been questioned because the effect outriggers have on vehicle dynamics is not well understood. This research quantifies changes in handling characteristics with outrig- gers attached to a test vehicle. Three outrigger systems of different masses were developed and tested through various limit and sub- limit handling maneuvers. Analysis of the data generated during testing indicates improvements necessary for future outrigger designs leading to better understanding of vehicle dynamics and potentially reduced injuries from rollovers. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940227. (SP- 1 0 1 6) Simulator motion base sizing using simula- tion. W. Riley Garrott, Vehicle Research and Test Center. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proposed building the National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS). As proposed, the NADS will move the simulator's cab so that realistic motion cues are provided to the simulator's driver. It is necessary to determine the motion base capabilities that the NADS will need to simulate different severities and types of driving maneuvers with adequate simulated motion fidelity. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop tools, based on existing vehicle dynamics simulations, simulator washout algo- rithms, and human perceptual models, that allow required motion base capabilities to be determined and (2) to use these tools to per- form analyses that determine the motion base capabilities needed by the NADS. The NADS motion base configuration examined during this study, which may not correspond to that used when the NADS is actually constructed, includes an X-Y Carriage capable of large excursion. Riding on top of the X-Y Carriage is a Hexapod that can perform smaller motions in all three directions and generate rota- tions about all three axes. On top of the Hexapod is a Yaw Turntable which allows for continuous yaw rotation. The simulator cab is on the Yaw Turntable. Ideally, NADS will be able to simulate motions with sustained accelerations of up to 0.8 g with a scale factor (a multiplicative fac- tor applied to all accelerations and rotations) of at least 0.50. Meet- ing this specification for the washout algorithm studied and the 25</page><page sequence="25">940227-940234 motion fidelity requirements used requires a motion base that has ±120 feet of X-Y Carriage travel. Building a motion base of this size will be an engineering challenge. It may be acceptable to use a scale factor as low as 0.375 with the NADS. Using the lower scale factor drops the required X-Y Car- riage travel to ±45 feet. This study also found that a limited (as compared to continuous or unlimited) rotation Yaw Turntable may well be adequate for the NADS. 940228. (SP- 101 6) Meeting important cuing requirements with modest, real-time, interactive driving simulations. R. Wade Allen and Theodore J. Rosenthal , Systems Technology , Inc. Interactive simulation requires providing appropriate sensory cuing and stimulus/response dynamics to the driver. Sensory feed- back can include visual, auditory, motion, and proprioceptive cues. Stimulus/response dynamics involve reactions of the feedback cuing to driver control inputs including steering, throttle and brakes. The stimulus/response dynamics includes both simulated vehicle dynamics, and the response dynamics of the simulation hardware including computer processing delays. Typically, simulation realism will increase with sensory fidelity and stimulus/response dynamics that are equivalent to real- world conditions (i.e. without excessive time delay or phase lag). This paper discusses requirements for sensory cuing and stimu- lus/response dynamics in real-time, interactive driving simulation, and describes a modest fixed/base (i.e. no motion) device designed with these considerations in mind. The simulations includes reason- able complex and validated vehicle dynamics, and visual, auditory and steering force-feel cuing. Compensation is also provided for computational delays. The simulation has been used in research applications, and as a means for screening drivers for impairment. The modest and successful nature of this approach suggests that driving simulation might find wide application in research, training and screening applications where cost is an important consideration. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940229. (SP- 101 6) Active control of drive motion of four wheel steering car with neural network. Toshinari Shiotsuka and Akio Nag amats u, Tokyo Institute of Technology; Kazuo Yoshida, Keio Univ.; and Mitsuru Nagaoka, Mazda Motor Corp. Two kinds of active control systems, using neural networks, (NN), are presented for realizing optimal driving motion of four wheel steer (4WS) cars. The first system is based on the assumption that the car is simplified as a linear two wheel bicycle model, and that the friction force between tire and road surface is represented by Fiala' s nonlinear model. The nonlinear relation between the slip angle of tire and the cornering force is expressed with NN. A model- following type control strategy is adopted in the first system, with both the feedforward and feedback gains for the control of the rear wheel steering angle adaptively determined with NN according to change of front wheel steering angle. The second system is based on the assumption that both the dynamical characteristics of the car and the tire friction force ar nonlinear. The nonlinear dynamical characteristics of the car and the friction forces are identified with NN, using the measured data of an actual car. The second control system is composed of only the NN model. It becomes evident by the simulation and the experiment using an actual car that driving performance of a car with the active control systems presented is far better than that of a car with the usual control system of fixed control gain. 940230. (SP- 101 6) A systematic approach to vehicle design using VDAS (Vehicle Dynamics Analysis Software). D. A. Crolla , D. N. L. Horton, P. C. Brooks, G. R. Firth, D. W. Shuttlewood, M. Woods, and C. K. Yip, University of Leeds. A comprehensive and systematic approach to vehicle dynamics analysis is described. All the commonly required calculations for vehicle dynamics studies have been embodied in a computer pack- age called VDAS (Vehicle Dynamics Analysis Software). Examples taken from off-road vehicle applications are chosen to show how this particular class of dynamics problem can be tackled efficiently using this package. In addition to the standard range of calculations for vehicle ride and handling behavior, e.g. natural frequencies, mode shapes, fre- quency responses, power spectral densities, steady state handling diagrams, etc., the package incorporates more advanced features including derivation of control laws for active/semi-active suspen- sion applications and sensitivity analysis to assist design studies. The VDAS package currently contains a range of ride and han- dling models of varying degrees of complexity, suitable for vehicle analysis. Further models can easily be added and a front- end pro- cessor has been developed for automating the derivation of new models. 940231. (SP- 101 6) Validation of computer simulations of vehicle dynamics. J. E. ABernard and C. L. Clover, Iowa State Univ. This paper examines the validation process for computer simula- tions of ground vehicle dynamics. Validation in this context may be defined as the process of gaining confidence that the calculations yield useful insights into the behavior of the simulated vehicle. It is our view that this process requires three separate questions to be addressed: 1) Is the model appropriate for the vehicle and maneuver of interest? 2) Is the simulation based on equations that faithfully replicate the model? 3) Are the input parameters reasonable? This paper addresses each of these questions, mainly from an analytical point of view. The paper then addresses strengths and weaknesses of vehicle testing as part of the validation process. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940233. (SP- 1020) A review of diesel particulate control tech- nology and emission effects. John H. Johnson, Susan T. Bagley, Linda D. Gratz, and David G. Leddy, Michigan Technological Univ. Studies have been conducted at Michigan Technological Univer- sity (MTU) for over twenty years on methods for characterizing and controlling particulate emissions from heavy- duty diesel engines and the resulting effects on regulated and unregulated emissions. During that time, control technologies have developed in response to more stringent EPA standards for diesel emissions. This paper is a review of : 1) modern emission control technologies, 2) emissions sampling and chemical, physical and biological characterization methods and 3) summary results from recent studies conducted at MTU on heavy- duty diesel engines with a trap and an oxidation cat- alytic converter (OCC) operated on three different fuels. Contol technology developments discussed are particulate traps, catalysts, advances in engine design, the application of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and modifications of fuel formulations. Meth- ods for dilution tunnel sampling, particle size analysis, chemical analysis with emphasis on polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nitro-PAH, and biological characterization using muta- genic activity (AMES) assays are described, along with statistical approaches to experimental design and data analysis. In studies at MTU, both particulate traps and an OCC have been shown to be effective for the reduction of total particulate matter (TPM), with the OCC being better at reducing all forms of hydrocar- bon emissions, including PAH and nitro-PAH, and with the traps being better at removing the solids (SOL). The use of low sulfur fuel (0.01% by mass) has led to additional reductions in TPM; the low sulfur fuel has been shown to reduce the number of small, nuclei- mode particles for one of the engines tested. PAH, nitro-PAH, and mutagenic actively levels generally decreased with use of either the traps or the OCC. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940234.

(SP- 1020) Development of a diesel particulate filter composition and its effect on thermal durability and filtration performance. Martin J. Murtagh, Diana L. Sherwood , and Louis S. Socha, Jr., Corning, Inc. This paper details the development of the EX-80 composition, a new cordierite material for use as a diesel particulate filter (DPF), that was developed based on the following objectives; (1) improved thermal durability, (2) high filtration efficiency and (3) low pressure drop. The achievement of these goals was demonstrated through engine testing, stress modeling, and other evaluations. EX-80 has a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) averaging less than 4x10"7oC'1 (25 °C- 800°C), the Modulus of Rupture (MOR) averages greater than 350 psi and the Modulus of Elasticity (MOE) averages less than 0.8 x 106 psi. The improvement of these three properties has resulted in improved thermal durability for EX-80 as compared to the current Corning DPF compositions (EX-47, EX-54 and EX-66). The new cordierite composition has been designed to achieve a low pressure drop as a function of soot loading (0.30 in Hg/gm of soot collected), coupled with high efficiency, averaging greater than 90%. Engine testing was performed by Ortech Interna- tional on a Detroit diesel 6V92TA DDECII engine to evaluate filtra- tion performance. In addition to confirming that EX-80 meets the filtration efficiency and back pressure goals, microscopy studies of engine tested filters has led to further understanding of the filtration mechanism for wall-flow filters. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940236. (SP- 1020) Flow characteristics of SiC diesel particu- late filter materials. S. C. Sorenson and Jakob W. H0j, Technical University of Denmark; and Per Stoobe, NoTox A/S. Recent studies have shown that SiC provides substantial advan- tages for use as the material for wall flow diesel particulate filters. In addition to very advantageous thermal properties, it has been shown that SiC based filter material has higher permeability than Cordierite. This paper presents a comparison of the basic flow characteris- tics of SiC based and Cordierite based wall flow filter material, expressed terms of parameters which are basic materials properties that are independent of filter geometry. In addition, the flow characteristics of the particulate matter col- lected on the filter during engine operation are presented. The results show that the advantageous flow characteristics observed with the basic filter material are retained for loaded filters, up to very high loadings. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940237. (SP- 1020) Development of wall-flow type diesel par- ticulate filter system with reverse pulse air regeneration. Toshio Yamada, Minoru Machida, and Yukihito Ichikawa, NGK Insulators, Ltd. The effects of the factors of reverse pulse air regeneration; pulse air pressure, pulse air time and pulse air interval, were evaluated. Pulse air pressure significantly affects of DPF' s pressure drop increase. Pulse air time and pulse air interval do not greatly affect a DPF' s pressure drop. Current DPFs and samples with modified materials were tested. The pressure drop increase varied with the material properties, such as mean pore size and porosity. Currently DPFs are applicable to a DPF system with reverse pulse air regeneration. There is the possibility to get an optimum DPF for the reverse pulse air regeneration system by changing the mean pore size, porosity and/or other properties. 940238. (SP- 1 020) International experience using diesel cata- lytic converters for urban buses. S. Özuürk and D. L. McKinnon, Engine Control Systems, Ltd.; J. L. Puliafito, Government of Men- doza; and C. I rigo and Jorge Sans, Mendoembrague S. A. A series of demonstration programs have been carried out over the last three years to determine the efficiency and performance of diesel catalytic converters on urban buses for smoke and gaseous emissions reductions. Some of these studies and results were out- lined last year in an SAE Paper No. 930132. This paper highlights the final results of the demonstration pro- grams including the gaseous emissions and opacity reductions achieved on various types of diesel powered engines by using diesel catalytic converters. Also included in this paper is durability data obtained on the converters during these demonstrations. 940239. (SP- 1020) Performance characteristics of a novel die- sel oxidation catalyst. Ken Voss, Bulení Yavuz, Carol Hirt, and Robert Farrauto, Engelhard Corp. The catalytic control of emissions from diesel engines is more complicated than for the gaseous pollutants generated from spark ignited, gasoline fueled engines in that particulates composed of sol- ids (dry carbon, and inorganic sulphates and ash), and liquids (unburned fuel and lubricating oil) in addition to gases (hydrocar- bons including oxygenates, carbon monoxide and nitric oxides) are emitted. Furthermore, the sulfur present in diesel fuel can be con- verted to sulphates by the catalyst contributing to the particulate load. Still further, the lubricating oil contains compounds of zinc, phosphorous, calcium, sodium, etc. which accumulate on the cata- lyst and can contribute to loss of durability by poisoning of the cata- lytic sites. This paper describes the results of a catalyst screening and aging study designed to determine the nature of catalyst deactivation for diesel applications. The effectiveness and durability of the catalyst towards the oxidation of the VOF portion of the particulates was the primary goal of the program. A secondary goal was to determine the effect of aging on gas phase activity; that is the reduction of gaseous CO and HC. An important consequence of this study was the devel- opment of a completely new family of catalyst technologies in which proprietary base metal oxides dominate the catalytic conver- sion of the VOF component of the particulates. Gaseous CO and HC are also reduced, without generation of unacceptable amounts of sulphate by SO2 oxidation. This is accomplished by incorporating relatively small amounts of precious metals and other base metal oxides into the formulation. 940240. (SP- 1020) Development of oxidation catalyst for die- sel engine. Yoshitsugu Ogura, Kazuya Kibe, Satoshi Kaneko, and Yukari Ito, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Norihiko Aono, Cataler Indus- trial Co., Ltd. In developing an oxidation catalyst for reducing diesel particu- lates, it is necessary to balance two conflicting characteristics. One is high oxidizing activity so that the catalyst can reduce the Soluble Organic Fraction (SOF) efficiency even at low exhaust tempera- tures. The other is the suppression of sulphate formation at high exhaust temperatures. First it was studied that active metals and coating materials are given effects on the reduction of SOF, the formulation of sulphate and durability, by using catalysts equivalent in composition to the oxidation catalyst for gasoline-engines. Based on these findings, a two-stage catalyst was developed. It satisfies the two characteristics at a comparatively high level by selecting materials and optimizing the catalyst composition. 27</page><page sequence="27">940241-940248 940241. (SP- 1020) The influence of an oxidation catalytic converter on the chemical and biological characteristics of diesel exhaust emissions. K. F. Hansen, F. Bak, E. M. Andersen, and H . Bejder, Danish Technological Institute; and H. Autrup, Institute of Environmental and Occupational Medicine. The reduction of diesel engine exhaust emissions was investi- gated using a conventional low-sulphate catalyst, manufactured by Svenska Emissionsteknik AB, Sweden. Measurements were made of regulated pollutants (HC, CO, NOx and particulates) and also some unregulated pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH]). The mutagenic potential of the emissions were investigated by Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium) using tester strains TA98, activation. In general, it appeared that the use of an oxidation cata- lytic converter decreased pollutants emission. 940242. (SP- 1020) Catalytic performance of Alumina for NOx control in diesel exhaust. Hiroshi Tsuchida, Mitsunori Tabata, Katsumi Miyamoto, Tomohiro HYoshinari, and Hatsutaro Yamazaki, COSMO Oil; Hideaki Hamada, Yoshiaki Kintaichi, Motoi Sasaki, and Takehiko Ito, National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research; and Tadao Nakatsuji, and Masafumi Yoshi- moto, Sakai Chemical. The catalytic performance of alumina for NOx control from the exhaust of a diesel engine was investigated. Although a slight decrease in catalytic activity was observed at the initial stage of the catalyst evaluation, more than 70% of NOx conversion was obtained at 400°C and a space velocity of 10,000 1/h for more than 2,000 hours by using a honeycomb type alumina catalyst and methanol as the reducing agent. The experimental results using synthesized exhaust gases con- taining SO2 and characteristics of alumina revealed that the initial catalytic deactivation is ascribed to the accumulation of sulfur on the surface of the alumina. We have also succeeded in improving the de-NOx performance of alumina, and more than 90% of NOx conversion can be obtained. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940243. (SP- 1020) Effects of an oxidation catalytic converter on regulated and unregulated diesel emissions. Gregory M. P ataky, Cummins Engine Company, Inc.; and Kirby J. Baumgard, Linda D. Gratz, Susan T. Bagley, David G. Leddy, and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. In this study, the effects of an oxidation catalytic converter (OCC) on regulated and unregulated emissions from a 1991 proto- type Cummins LI 0-3 10 diesel engine fueled with a 0.01 weight per- cent sulfur fuel were investigated. The OCC' s effects were deter- mined by measuring and comparing selected raw exhaust emissions with and without the platinum-based OCC installed in the exhaust system, with the engine operated at three steady- state modes. It was found that the OCC had no significant effect on oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and nitric oxide (NO) at any mode, but reduced hydrocarbon (HC) emissions by 60 to 70 percent. The OCC reduced total particulate matter (TPM) levels by 27 to 54 percent, primarily resulting from 53 to 71 percent reductions of the soluble organic fraction (SOF). The OCC increased sulfate (SO42 ) levels at two of the three modes (modes 9 and 10), but the overall SC&gt;42"contribution to TPM was less than 6 percent at all modes due to the low sulfur level of the fuel. The solids fraction (SOL) was not significantly affected by the OCC at any mode. Vapor phase organics (termed XOC) were decreased by 56 to 58 percent. The particle size distribu- tions with the OCC were similar to those under baseline conditions, with virtually no change in either the nuclei or the accumulation mode. The OCC generally reduced the measured polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, (PAH) associated with the SOF and XOC. Some nitro- PAH levels (e.g., particle-associated, 1,6-DNP) were lower when the OCC was used, but due to higher variability in the data (compared to the PAH data), statistical-based comparisons were not conducted. The OCC generally increased the mutagenic activity per mass of the SOF and XOC; however, for all but one case, these increases were offset by the decreases in the SOF and XOC levels. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940244. Calculation of random vibration fatigue life from finite element model calculations. Dean M. Ford, Delco Remy. Exposure to random vibration excitation is a test criteria used to screen, compare, and validate components for automotive and aero- space applications. Finite element analysis is sometimes employed to help understand or correct random vibration induced failures. A logical and consistent method for calculating relative fatigue life due to random vibration is needed. The method presented uses the calculated natural frequencies, normalized mode stresses, modal participation factors, and modal damping ratios to synthesize a representative time history which can then be processed through existing damage calculation algorithms such as rainflow counting. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940245. Prediction of the fatigue life with the finite element method. Wilfried Eichlseder and Bernhard Unger, Steyr Daimler Puch AG. A postprocessor program for the calculation of the fatigue life of components calculated with the finite element method (FEM) is described. Based on the stresses calculated by FEM and the material data of unnotched test specimens, s/n curves in relation to FE nodes are calculated for components taking into account the most varied influencing factors, such as amplitude stress tensor, mean stress ten- sor, relative stress gradient, surface roughness, technological influ- ences, local plastic deformations, etc. The results of the calculations, such as damage distribution and insusceptibility to permanent rup- ture, are graphically represented in the form of FE color plots. Besides the possibility of the calculation of the fatigue life of com- ponents also costs and time can be reduced during the development phase of vehicles. 940246. Critical plane fatigue analysis of various constant amplitude tests for SAE 1045 steels. C.-C. Chu, Ford Motor Co. A large number of published constant amplitude test results, in- phase as well as out-of-phase, on SAE 1045 steels are analyzed here in an attempt to evaluate the general applicability of several damage parameters to complex multiaxial cyclic loadings. The critical plane approach is adopted and the calculated results from various constant amplitude tests are directly compared on a damage parameter versus fatigue life plot. It is found that while many damage parameters can predict fatigue life for in- phase constant amplitude loadings within a factor of two of the observed life, only two biaxial types of param- eters evaluated here can consistently produce acceptable fatigue life prediction for out-of-phase constant amplitude loadings. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940247. Random fatigue load history reconstruction. S. Thangjitham, N. E. Dowling, and C. Leser, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. A concise method for modeling nonstationary fatigue loading histories is presented. The minimum number of model parameters is achieved by fitting the variations in mean and variance by a trun- cated Fourier series. An autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is used to describe the stationary component. Justification of the method is made by comparing fatigue relevant parameters obtained when subjected to the original and reconstructed histories. In spite of a relatively small number of parameters required, the model is shown to give good results that fall within the bounds pre- dicted by the original history. 940248. Modeling of shock absorber behavior using artificial neural networks. J. w. Fash, Ford Motor Co. There is an increasing need for simulation of vehicle perfor- mance in the development process in order to achieve quality and reliability targets within (World Class) vehicle program timing. 28</page><page sequence="28">940248-940255 Simulation of vehicle dynamics, handling behavior and component loads has been achieved with multibody dynamic software. Predic- tion of service loads for component durability assessment requires accurate modeling of each component in the system over the full range of operation. In particular, the automotive shock absorber has a significant influence on the load transfer between suspension and body. Traditional models for shock absorber behavior are dependent on the internal velocity of the component. Previous studies and experimental data show that the behavior of the shock absorber is much more complex. In this study, neural network modeling tech- niques have been used to represent this complex behavior and pro- vide a simple but accurate model that is computationally efficient and that can be integrated into a full vehicle simulation. 940249. Fatigue properties of fillet welded lap joints of high strength steel sheets for automobiles. Akihide Yoshitake, Masayuki Kinoshita, Koichi Osawa, Kazuhiro Ogawa, Hirotaka Nakagawa, and Makoto Kabasawa, NKK Corp. The effect of a concentration of stress at a welded joint on the fatigue limit was investigated from the point of view of the effective design of automotive parts made of high strength hot rolled steel sheets. The stress concentration at the welded joint was evaluated using FEM analysis and the effect of stress concentration on endurance limit was investigated by fatigue tests using specimens of practical welded joints and specimens with the simulated configuration of welded joints. It is pointed out that another effect besides stress concentration and residual stress should be considered to evaluate the endurance limits for high tensile strength materials of over 590 N/mm2. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940250. The design and application of a multi-axis load transducer. Mary J. Wickham, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories ; Dale R. Galliart, Deere &amp; Co.; and Christopher J. Nachtsheim and Donald R. Riley, University of Minnesota. The determination of loads applied to a structure is often neces- sary in the design process. In some situations it is not feasible to insert a load cell in the system to measure these applied loads. In these cases, it would be advantageous to utilize the structure itself as a load transducer. This can be accomplished by measuring strains at a number of locations on the structure. The precision with which the applied loads can be estimated from measured structural responses depends on the number of strain gages utilized and their placement on the structure. This paper pres- ents a computational methodology which utilizes optimal experi- mental design techniques to select the number, locations and angular orientations of the strain gages which will provide the most precise load estimates based on the generalized load vector. Selection is made from a candidate set created using a finite element analysis. This method is illustrated by applying it to an existing component on an agricultural disk. Both laboratory and field tests were com- pleted and the results are provided. 940251. High temperature cyclic fatigue damage modeling of alumina. Darrell, Socie and Nishit Dey, University of Illinois. Cylcic loading is not as damaging as static loading of ceramics at high temperatures. Microcrack growth retardation has been estab- lished as a mechanism for increasing the durability of ceramics at high temperatures. A combined experimental and theoretical approach provides a mechanistic understanding of the deformation and failure processes in ceramic materials at high temperatures. Results demonstrate that the high temperature behavior of some ceramic material systems are controlled by the behavior of the grain boundary phase whose response is considerably different under static and cyclic loading. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940252. An efficient approach for considering durability schedules in the structural optimization of ground vehicles. M. E. M. El-Sayed and E. H. Lund, Florida International Univ. This paper presents an approach for considering durability sched- ules in the optimal design of ground vehicles. The desired crack ini- tiation fatigue life requirement of the structure in blocks of the dura- bility schedule is achieved by using an equivalent limiting stress in the optimization process. The equivalent limiting stress is calculated using the contemporary fatigue life formulation and the golden sec- tion technique. To demonstrate the approach, the minimum weight optimization tasks of some test cases with fatigue life constraints are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940253. The influence of calcium treatment on the mechani- cal properties of plain carbon (SAE 1050) steel. S. K. Putatunda, Wayne State Univ.; A. H. Christ, Bethlehem Steel; E. J. Cabadas and M. G. Shapona, Ford Motor Co.; K. N. Tatteff, Bethlehem Steel ; and M. B. Rao, Wayne State Univ. The influence of calcium treatment on the mechanical properties of a plain carbon steel (SAE 1050) was investigated. The mechani- cal properties investigated were tensile and impact strength, fatigue crack growth rate, and the fatigue threshold. Impact testing was con- ducted at both room temperature and at -40°C. Several heats of both calcium and non-calcium treated steel (SAE 1050) were tested in both the as hot-rolled condition and in the quenched and tempered condition (with a hardness level of HRC = 45). The results of this investigation show no significant difference in the tensile properties or room temperature impact properties between the calcium treated and the non-calcium treated steels. However, the impact strengths of calcium treated steels were slightly higher than that of no-calcium treated steels at -40°C. The fatigue threshold was lower and the near- threshold fatigue crack growth rate was higher for calcium treated material than for the non- calcium treated material, both in the as hot-rolled condition and in the quenched and tempered condition. This difference in fatigue threshold and fatigue crack growth rate has been determined to be caused by the difference in size of inclusions in these two materials. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940254. GPS receiver using in-vehicle diversity antenna. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Seiji Ishikawa, Yuichi Murakami, and Tornio Yasuda, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd.; and Atsushi Watanabe, Toyota Motor Corp. The usage of GPS (Global Position System) in various fields is growing. The best solution known for GPS outage problems in vehi- cle navigation systems is DR (dead reckoning). An inertial system based on distance and heading sensors backs up the GPS equipment by relaying information during periods without satellite visibility. Because the DR inertial system delivers relative positions and GPS absolute positions, it seems logical to combine the two to minimize the cumulative drift errors, mainly due to distance and heading sen- sor resolution. For in-vehicle GPA receiver, there are problems in maintaining the operation performance even in unfavorable environments like an urban area and using antenna layout which does not hinder the vehi- cle design. In the test, the solutions to these problems and a new type GPS receiving system which is equipped with Toyota Electro- Multivi- sion are described. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940255.

A very low noise uP, interfaced, multiple high side driver with self diagnostics for car radio application. Mario Paparo, William Javurek, William H. Smith, and Giovanni Pietro- bon, SGS-Thomson Microelectronics. Modern car radio applications demand small, low cost power devices that can control large currents with the lowest power dissi- pation. These devices must be very low in EMI and easily adaptable to "distributed" radio system along the vehicle. This paper will dis- cuss a new multiple high side driver realized in a mixed Bipolar- CMOS-DMOS 60V technology capable of delivering several amps. The mixed technology approach also allows the realization of a complete set of built-in diagnosis circuitry monitoring the function- ality of the different outputs, open, short, thermal status. Over 700 CMOS gate digital interface makes this available for distributed car radio applications on a serial Bidirectional Bus. To extend the total system functionality each of the three channels have an independent temperature sensor. This permits the radio to continue to operate event if an overload affects one of the auxiliary functions. Rdson versus die size of the high efficient N channel DMOS output devices was optimized by the use of a computer aided power DMOS layout generator and double level of Aluminum metalization. In order to meet the EMI car radio requirements, a low noise internal charge pump drives the N-channel DMOS outputs. 940258. Universal grid vacuum fluorescent display for auto- motive applications. Soichi Shinya, Yoshimichi Matsuda, Masanori Saito, and Itaru Hatori, Futaba Corp.; and Martin A. Saunders, Futaba Corporation of America. VFD has occupied a superior position as an automotive informa- tion display device because of its self emissive high luminance, high reliability, and excellent readability. Recently, most VFD applica- tions have demanded more flexible graphic design capability, reduc- tion of development cost, and short lead time. To respond to these demands, the Universal Grid VFD was developed and mass pro- duced for consumer applications. Taking advantage of its free design capability and unique driving method, Universal Grid VFD was adapted to automotive applications (ECC, ETR, Odo/Trip Meter) and achieved 1700 cd/m luminance at 12V and 1/3 duty anode/grid operation. This paper discusses the development of Uni- versal Grid VFD, its characteristics and reliability. 940259. One-chip fluency DAC. Takas hi Tokuyama and Tadashi Sano, Alpine Electronics Inc. Six years ago Alpine made the proposition that ultrasonic com- ponents were important to audio reproduction. The implementation of our proposal was the DA-07, a unique D to A converter employ- ing a new interpolation program. Since then we have continued to study the impact of ultrasonics. We introduced a D to A converter unit for car audio (model 3900), which employed this technology. But, it did not penetrate widely because of its size and cost. Success required integration. The new one-chip Fluency DAC (FEDAC) incorporated D/A conversion and DSP to fully implement the ' 'Flu- ency" interpolation method without loss of audio performance. This paper describes the theory of Fluency interpolation, the history of integration, and the performance evaluation of the one-chip Fluency DAC. 940260. The radio mounting system. Gilbert L. McCauley and James Van Hout, Chrylser Corp. Chrysler Corporation Interior Electrical/Entertainment Depart- ment currently has three different mounting tab configurations on the radio escutcheon required by five platforms of radio installation. Prior to the re-organization into platforms, the corporation had one corporate mounting configuration. The reorganization into plat- forms encouraged diversification including different radio mounting locations. This however, requires three separate part numbers for the same radio unit, resulting in additional cost. How can we assure product diversification between platforms while controlling cost and managing complexity? 940261. Coping with road noise: a DSP solution. Thomas E. Miller, International Jensen Inc. The performance of automotive sound systems is compromised by the effects of acoustic noise. Digital techniques are necessary to measure the noise in a car accurately and to predict the effects of masking. It will be shown that it is possible to predict and reverse the effects of noise induced masking. The following paper will describe a system that modifies music signals to compensate for these effects. The system is similarly effective on music and speech. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940262. A new technique for measuring spider compliance. Robert J. True, International Jensen Incorporated. A new system for measuring spider compliance has been devel- oped. The result of the measurement is a plot that maps the compli- ance versus displacement. The technique quickly and nondestruc- tively generates the data and is almost completely automated. The method is reviewed and results documenting performance and improvement over an EIA standard test are presented. Several examples of actual measurements that illustrate the usefulness of the measurement are shown as well. 940264. Integrated backlite antenna system for AM/FM and TV broadcast reception and for mobile telephone. H. K. Linden- meier, J. F. Hopf, and L. M. Reiter, University of the Bundeswehr Munich; and B. M. Leinwetter, Hans Kolbe &amp; Co. With increasing number of mobile radio services (AM/FM/TV/ phone/weatherband/remote control) the number of antennas required increases. For better quality of FM-reception antenna diversity must be applied. Mobile TV reception is almost impossible without antenna diversity. Therefore for some services more than one antenna is required. In the paper a multiantenna backlite system is presented. The antenna structures of the active receiving antennas are printed on the glass, partly simultaneously used as heaters. The phone antenna is mounted "on glass" in the middle of the screen at the upper edge of the window far away from passers-by. The electromagnetic field in the car is reduced by a shielding additionally printed on the screen. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940265. Mobile FM reception: an evaluation of the effective- ness of FM diversity systems. Richard D. Zerod, Ford Motor Co. Increasing customer expectations, combined with the expanding application of high-performance media delivery systems, requires a high performance level be achieved for automotive FM reception with the existing analog broadcast technology. Multipath distortion is often cited as a leading industry concern that can limit the quality of mobile FM reception. FM diversity has been identified as a potential methodology for improving the reception performance under multipath conditions. However, the delay time and strength of any signal reflections can vary considerably under differing terrain and geographic conditions. The corresponding amplitude and phase disturbances within the transmission channel are significantly different as a function of the propagation environment. Additionally, the specific implementation strategy and architecture of the diversity system can have a signifi- cant impact on the performance effectiveness of the system. This paper will review the spectral and transmission channel requirements for distortion free FM reception and the contamination that occurs under multipath propagation conditions. Phase calcula- tions and antenna system measurements will attempt to quantify the relative performance improvements that might be expected with a space diversity system.

AUDIONAV - An automotive voice operated sensor- free navigation system. Charles La Rue , ANSI; and Robert Diller and Yosufi Tyebkhan, Ameri gon. An in-car navigation system has been developed that eliminates the hurdle of high retail costs now restricting the widespread market penetration of navigation systems. Most commercial navigation systems utilize expensive location devices such as Global Positioning Satellite (G.P.S.) systems to ensure that the vehicle "knows" where it is at all times. Addition- ally, these systems typically use some mechanical means to input the destination. The Amerigon AudioNav does not use expensive location devices and sensor systems. It is voice operated, using state-of-the- art speech recognition technology and recorded speech to communi- cate with the driver. This paper describes the AudioNav system and details the sys- tem's benefits by discussing its capabilities and performance. 940267. Hybrid combustion engine with premixed gasoline homogeneous charge and ignition by injected diesel fuel - Effects of pre- combustion chamber parameters. Hiroaki Yone- tani, Tokyo Polytechnic College; and Itaru Fukutani, University of Industrial Technology. A hybrid combustion engine in which a premixed gasoline homogeneous charge was ignited by a small amount of injected die- sel fuel under a high compression ratio has been tested utilizing a modified 4-stroke cycle diesel engine with a pre- combustion cham- ber. This concept was effective not only in decreasing smoke density and fuel consumption but also in increasing engine output. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940268. Hybrid combustion engine with premixed gasoline homogeneous charge and ignition by injected diesel fuel - Exhaust emission characteristics. Hiroaki Yonetani and Kaoru Hara, Tokyo Polytechnic College; and Itaru Fukutani, University of Industrial Technology. A hybrid combustion engine in which a premixed gasoline homogeneous charge was ignited by a small amount of injected die- sel fuel under a high compression-ratio has been tested on a modi- fied 4-stroke cycle DI engine. It was found that the premixed gaso- line was effective not only for decreasing the fuel consumption, but also for reducing the particulate mass emission both in the high and over load regions. 940269. Hybrid combustion engine with premixed gasoline homogeneous charge and ignition by injected diesel fuel - On-road test using a bus. Hiroaki Yonetani, Tokyo Polytechnic College ; and Naoki Okanishi and Itaru Fukutani, University of Industrial Technology. A hybrid combustion engine in which a premixed gasoline homogeneous charge was ignited by a small amount of injected die- sel fuel under a high compression ratio was made by modifying a 4-stroke cycle diesel engine and was tested on a a bus. It was found that the premixed of gasoline was effective not only for decreasing the fuel consumption but also for reducing the smoke density during an acceleration road test. The effect of introducing a small amount of N2 gas for suppressing the diesel knock under heavy load operation was examined. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940270. Optical measurements of soot particle size, number density and temperature in a direct injection diesel engine as a function of speed and load. Dale R. Tree, Cummins Engine Co.; and David E. Foster, University of Wisconsin. In-cylinder measurements of soot particle size, number density, and temperature have been made using optical measurements in a direct injection diesel engine. The measurements were made at one location approximately 5 mm long and 1.5 mm wide above the bowl near the head. Two optical techniques were used simultaneously involving light scattering, extinction and radiation. An optical probe was designed and mounted in a modified exhaust valve which intro- duced a beam of light into the cylinder and collected the scattered and radiating light from the soot. The resulting measurements were semi- quantitative, giving an absolute uncertainty on the order of ± 50% which was attributed mainly to the uncertainty of the optical properties of the soot and the heterogeneous nature of the soot cloud. Measurements at three speeds and three overall equivalence ratios were made. For all of the operating conditions the soot in the mea- surement volume increased in size to a maximum followed by a rapid decrease. The peak soot diameters were in a range of 30-50 mm. Peak soot diameter, soot volume fraction, and soot temperature appeared to increase with equivalence ratio at the measurement location. The results also suggested the soot cloud to be very dense with peak soot volume fraction near 4-6 x 10"6 and thick with a soot cloud thickness approximately 0.4-0.6 times the length from the pis- ton to the head. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940273. Design for pitch and bounce motions of single- passenger off- road vehicles. David A. Renfroe and Gregory L. Fleniken, Renfroe Engineering, Inc. Using a validated computer model, general design rules of thumb are developed fo the design of single passenger off-road vehicles (ATV). The question of spring stiffness balance from front to rear is discussed along with the effects of damping ratios in jounce and rebound, and tire/suspension stiffness ratio, and suspension travel. The design objective is to minimize vehicle bounce and pitch accel- erations transmitted to the rider and to maintain as flat of a riding position as possible. 940274. Modeling of pitch and bounce motions of singe- passenger off- road vehicles. Gregory L. Fleniken and David A. Renfroe, Renfroe Engineering, Inc. A four degree of freedom model of a single passenger off-road vehicle (ATV) is presented. A designer may use the model to study the effects of spring stiffnesses, damping coefficients in bump and jounce, tire stiffnesses, center of gravity placement, and vehicle moment of inertia on the vertical bouncing and pitching motion of the sprung and unsprung masses over any terrain profile. In order to isolate the effects of the rider, he is modeled as if in the posting position as a mass concentrated at the foot pegs. 940275. Effect of an add-on cab on the golf-cart's rollover characteristics. Bangalore A. Suresh and James C. Wambold, Pennsylvania Transportation Institute. The purpose of this study was to reconstruct the accident situa- tion of a golf-cart with three persons in it. The cart was designed to carry two persons and their golf bags, someone had fixed an add-on cab. Tilt-table testing was carried out to estimate the rollover threshold and to measure the center-of- gravity location of the vehi- cle, which was used to do preliminary stability analysis for different loading conditions. Tests were carried out with and without the add-on cab. The add-on cab deteriorated the rollover characteristics by raising the center- of-gravity height, while the presence of an additional rider on the rear-left wheel arch, biased the load distribu- tion. These two effects resulted in reducing the rollover threshold. Generally, tilt-table test results overestimated the rollover threshold, so there is a good possibility in real world situations the acceleration experienced by the vehicle during steady-turn maneuvers on an even surface could lead to rollover. Other factors like the transient vehicle response, uneven terrain, wind, or bad driving practice may further reduce this threshold value. 31</page><page sequence="31">940276-940282 940276. Evaluation of a proposed ATV design modification. R. L. Piziali, G. F. Fowler , R. Merala , D. S. Grewal, and R. L. McCarthy, Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. Successful development of a product requires the consideration and balancing of many design parameters. Proposals to modify designs that have been fully implemented and put into production are often made by people who were not involved in the original design process. Such proposals, commonly focusing on a specific aspect of the product, must be evaluated in the context of the overall product and its intended use by consumers; a design change may improve performance in one area but compromise performance in another, or even introduce new problem areas. As a case in point, several proposals have been made for operator systems with the claim that they would reduce the frequency and severity of injuries associated with All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) oper- ation. For example, Johnson, Carpenter, Wright &amp; Nelson (1991) considered selected accident modes and proposed a set of design changes involving a rollover protection system (ROPS) and signifi- cant vehicle modifications. In this paper, the design concept is eval- uated in more detail. A full-scale operating model of the proposed four-wheel vehicle prototype was built; systematic comparisons to ATVs were made considering mobility, utility, performance, and occupant protection. It was found that the proposed vehicle modifications in fact produce a new vehicle type with significantly reduced utility and perfor- mance compared to ATVs, without the likelihood of reducing the accident and injury risk associated with the use of the vehicle. Unlike existing ATVs, the Johnson et al. design does not appear to be a viable approach to balancing utility and safety. This outcome is consistent with other analyses and with the general conclusions reached by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). 940277. Steady-state and transient response characteristics of selected all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Graeme F. Fowler, Robert H. Fries, Roger L. McCarthy, Farshid A. Forouhar, and Robert E. Larson, Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. Lateral directional dynamic response properties and handling characteristics of All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) have been the sub- ject of several investigations. Experimentally measured steady-state and transient handling response parameters of four ATVs are pres- ented, reflecting two traditional automobile handling tests, the cir- cle-turn and the J-turn test. Two three- wheel and two four-wheel ATVs were tested. One of the three- wheel and one of the four- wheel ATVs were equipped with conventional, but lockable differ- entials. The J-turn tests yielded transient response properties includ- ing lateral acceleration and yaw rate response times to step steer inputs, and steady-state response properties such as understeer coef- ficient, steering sensitivity and yaw response gain. ATV J- turn test results are compared to J-turn test results from selected automobiles. The circle-turn tests provide a tool to investigate the influence of axle configuration on the handlebar steering effort required to nego- tiate a turn. 940279. Characterization of intake-generated flow fields in I.C. engines using 3-D particle tracking velocimetry (3-D PTV). N. Trigui and J. C. Kent, Ford Motor Co. ; and Y. G. Guezennec and W.-C. Choi, Ohio State Univ. Flow fields generated during the intake stroke of a 4-stroke I.C. engine are studied experimentally using water analog simulation. The fluid is seeded by small flow tracer particles and imaged by two digital cameras at BDC. Using a 3-D Particle Tracking Velocimetry technique recently developed, the 3-D motion of these flow tracers is determined in a completely automated way using sophisticated image processing and PTV algorithms. The resulting 3-D velocity fields are ensemble averaged over a large number of successive cycles to determine the mean characteristics of the flow field as well as to estimate the turbulent fluctuations. This novel technique was applied to three different cylinder head configurations. Each config- uration was run for conditions simulating ideal operation two differ- ent ways: first with both inlet ports open and second with only the primary port open. As expected, the resulting flow fields were found to be very different, and the level of detail provided by these experi- ments went far beyond the conventional swirl and tumble ratio esti- mates usually obtained with the steady flow rigs. This new approach yields valuable insight into the complex fluid mechanics of the intake stroke and the effect of geometry changes on the process. The results of this investigation were successfully correlated with com- bustion data available for the simulated conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940280. Use of experimentally measured in-cylinder flow field data at I VC as initial conditions to CFD simulations of compression stroke in I.C. engines - A feasibility study. N. Trigui, H. Affes, and J. C. Kent, Ford Motor Co. The feasibility of using experimentally determined flow fields at intake valve closing, IVC, as initial conditions for computing the in- cylinder flow dynamics during the compression stroke is demon- strated by means of a computer simulation of the overall approach. A commercial CFD code, STAR-CD, was used for this purpose. The study involved two steps. First, in order to establish a basis for com- parison, the in-cylinder flow field throughout the intake and com- pression strokes, from intake valve opening, IVO, to top dead cen- ter, TDC, was computed for a simple engine geometry. Second, experimental initial conditions were simulated by randomly select- ing and perturbing a set of velocity vectors from the computed flow field at IVC. These represent random sampling of velocity vectors and experimental errors from such techniques as 3-D PTV (3-D Par- ticle Tracking Velocimetry), 2-D PIV (2-D Particle Imaging Veloci- metry), LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry), ... The number of selected vectors as well as the magnitude of the imposed errors were varied systematically to determine the limitations of the approach. Using the interpolated field of the chosen subsets, the computation was then restarted and continued throughout the compression stroke. Comparisons with the base calculations were made to estimate the accuracy and limitations of the approach. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940281. Particle image velocimetry measurements of barrel swirl in a production geometry optical IC engine. . Reeves, C. P. Garner, J. C. Dent, and N. A. Halliwell, Loughborough University of Technology. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) here has been used to measure the instantaneous velocity field within a realistic geometry motored single cylinder engine. Through-the-piston-crown illumination of a vertical plane bisecting the inlet and exhaust valves in a four valve pent roof combustion chamber and the use of a corrective optical system has for the first time allowed the velocity field in a vertical plane within a cylindrical bore to be quantified with PIV. Tech- niques are described which permit accurate and repeatable camera focusing, laser to engine synchronization and seeding density con- trol. Large scale motion observed at 180° ATDC has been inter- preted as barrel swirl. Limitations of the current technique are dis- cussed with respect to general in-cylinder applications. 940282. Application of LIPA (Laser Induced Photochemical Anemometry) to the water analog model of a four-stoke IC engine. B. Stier and R. E. Falco, Michigan State Univ. Our research contributes to the overall attempt to gain knowledge of the fluid dynamical processes in engines by applying a new mea- surement technique called LIPA (Laser Induced Photochemical Anemometry). It concentrates on detecting fundamental flow and mixing mechanisms by performing experiments on the induction stroke in an axisymmetric motored water analog model of a four stroke IC engine. We present results of the investigations done at an engine speed of 20 RPM in water (corresponding to 340 RPM in air) at three different valve lifts (3,6 and 9 mm). Maps containing velocity vectors depict in 2-D a toroidal recirculation pattern that scales with cylinder volume and they suggest that the recirculation pattern possesses the highest degree of order - thus least mixing - 32</page><page sequence="32">940282-940290 for 9 mm valve lift and the lowest for 3 mm valve lift. A fluid dynamic model on the basis of freestream jet characteristics has been proposed to account for this phenomenon. Ensemble averaged velocity data demonstrates the stability and repeatability of the aver- aged flow field pattern in the investigated area for the second half of the induction stroke. A brief introduction is given on the addi- tional potential of LIPA by discussing data of velocity fluctuations, by including information of a velocity-versus-time plot for one loca- tion in the flow field, and data of vorticity distributions as contours in 3-D diagrams. 940283. Particle image velocimetry measurements in the pis- ton bowl of a DI diesel engine. P. Sweetland and R. D. Reitz, Uni- versity of Wisconsin. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to make gas velocity and turbulence measurements in a motored diesel engine. The experiments were conducted using a single-cylinder version of the Caterpillar 3406 production engine. One of the exhaust valves and the fuel injector port were used to provide optical access to the com- bustion chamber so that modifications to the engine geometry were minimal, and the results are representative of the actual engine. Measurements of gas velocity were made in a plane in the piston bowl using TÌO2 seed particles. The light sheet necessary for PIV was formed by passing the beam from a Nd:YAG laser through the injector port and reflecting the beam off a conical mirror at the cen- ter of the piston. PIV data was difficult to obtain due to significant out-of-plane velocities. However, data was acquired at 25° and 15° before top dead center of compression at 750 rev/min. Experiments were also conducted in a turbulent jet for comparison with previous jet measurements made with other techniques. It was found that high and low estimates of the turbulence intensity can be obtained from limited PIV data, and that length scales can be found by computing the turbulent dissipation and using ke turbulence model relations. In addition, the size of the eddies visible in high-pass filtered PIV data, and the size of vorticity concentrations were also found to be repre- sentative of the turbulence integral length scale. The engine PIV data was compared to flow and turbulence predictions from the mul- tidimensional KIVA-3 code. Reasonably good agreement was found between measured and predicted turbulence intensity and length scales in the engine. 940284. Analysis of in-cylinder turbulent air motion depen- dence on engine speed. Felice E. Cordone and Gerardo Valentino, Instituto Motori. In-cylinder cycle-resolved LDV measurements have been made in a diesel engine having a high-squish re-entrant combustion cham- ber with compression ratio of 21:1. The engine has been motored in the range of 1,000 to 3,000 rpm thanks to the use of self- lubricating seeding particles. Conventional ensemble- averaging and filtering techniques have been used for analyzing instantaneous velocity data obtained at two points along a diameter located in a horizontal plane at 5 mm below the engine head. The dependence of the mean motion and turbulence on engine speed has been evalu- ated. The effect of cut-off frequency selection on turbulence values has been also analyzed. Moreover, the Kolmogorov's -5/3 power domain has been investigated in detail by spectral analysis on the instantaneous velocity data. The results show the almost linear dependence of mean motion and turbulence on engine speed in the range investigated. The selec- tion of cut-off frequency has a greater influence on the high fre- quency fluctuation at lower engine speeds than at higher ones. The spectrum analysis of the instantaneous velocity data has shown that in the medium and high frequency range the data do not follow the Kolmogorov's -5/3 law, that is characteristic of isotropic turbulent flow. 940287. A study on sealing performance of dust cover. Tetsuro Iwami, NOK Corp.; and Shuji Shimamura, NOK General Partnership. Various kinds of dust covers made of rubber are used in the chas- sis of automobiles such as suspension and tie rods. Generally, sealing performance of the dust cover is expressed by the lip radial load and the repulsion force effected by the membrane stiffness. However, sealing performance was not fully explained by the concept of the lip radial load and the repulsion of the membrane stiffness. Through experiments, authors fully clarified the sealing perfor- mance introducing the concept of the pressure per unit area which is greatly affected by heat degradation and endurance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940288. Design optimization of automotive powertrain gas- kets and seals using CAE techniques. M. Radhkrishnan, Vasantha Sural, and Viresh Doshi, EASi Engineering. Lack of good sealing of the interfaces between the various com- ponents of the automotive powertrain can affect its functionality, performance and efficiency. The performance characteristics of a gasketed, or sealed joint (or assembly) in the powertrain, are its sealability, the strength of the flanges under assembly loads and the long term bolt torque retention under material degradation due to creep. A CAE approach has been presented to design, evaluate and optimize automotive powertrain gaskets, seals and gasket/seal assemblies under assembly conditions. In this approach, the shape of the gasket/seal cross-section is optimized to maximize sealing pressure, and the gasket/seal assembly is optimized for its perfor- mance characteristics. The interactions between the gasket/seal and the flange materials under assembly loads govern the performance of the gasket/seal assembly. A conventional linear CAE approach cannot be used because of, (a) the non-linear gasket/seal pressure versus compression characteristics, and (b) the 'geometric' non- linearity due to the positive sealing pressure when the gasket/seal is in contact with the flanges and lack of sealing pressure when the gasket/seal separates from the flanges. The design evaluation and optimization of (a) foam type gaskets with and without rubber beads that are common in the automotive engine, and (b) rubber seals that are common in the automotive transmission, using this approach, have been discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940289. Analysis of rubber boot seal using finite element method. Nobuo Maeda and Masahiro Matsuno, Keeper Co., Ltd. Knowing deformations and stress-stress fields of a rubber boot at large joint angles is a key factor in the design. Determinations of the deformations and strains used to depend on experiments. It would contribute greatly to the improvement in the development efficiently, if such experiments could be substituted by numerical analysis. It is, however, difficult to analyze the rubber boot, due the particular mechanical properties of the rubber materials and the complex three-dimensional contacts with the shaft and the boot itself accompanying such parts. Difficulties involved in the analysis are finally about to be solved by 5 measures. 940290. A system for the static and dynamic measurement of cylinder head to block separation in operating engines. Andrew J. Woodward, T&amp;N Technology Ltd. Measurement of the separation between cylinder head and block at discrete points across the gasket provides information to the designer which can be crucial in determining the properties of the gasket required to ensure complete sealing over all engine operating conditions, particularly during deep thermal shock testing. This paper describes the development of a measurement system which uses capacitive displacement transducers combined with high speed charge amplifiers to allow real time static and dynamic measure- ments of head to block displacement at discrete points across the gasket over a complete range of engine operating conditions.

Elastomer moulded gaskets for stationary structural components in combustion engines. Uwe Drebing, Dichtungstech- nik G. Bruss GmbH &amp; Co., KG. Elastomer moulded gaskets nowadays have to fulfill require- ments extending far beyond there basic function of sealing. Based on the specific know-how of the product-development gasket supplier, the characteristics of the finished gasket are deter- mined already during early stages of development. Model tests and the use of appropriate calculation methods lead to high quality levels of design within shortened development periods. 940293. (SP- 1023) Influence of battery characteristics on traction drive performance. Udo Winter, Siemens Automotive; and Jürgen Brandes, Siemens Drive and Standard Products. The development of zero emission vehicles requires new con- cepts of the electrical drive train. On one hand the vehicle perfor- mance for a Californian electric vehicle must give high acceleration values together with enough vehicle range. On the other hand the expected battery performance will be an extreme limitation of capa- bility. In this paper a comparison of an induction motor drive system is given for different working conditions and batteries such as Sodium Sulphur, Sodium Nickel Chloride and Nickel Cadmium. The results of simulations and practical experience show that exact vehicle predictions can be done if the battery effects such as internal losses and dynamic behavior are taken into account. 940294. (SP- 1023) Chassis design for a small electric city car. T. G. Chondros, S. M. Michalitsis, and S. D. Panteliou, University of Patras; and A. D. Dimarogonas, Washington Univ. The increasing environmental pollution, the noise emissions, the deteriorating traffic conditions in the big cities, and the decreasing oil deposits have forced the car industries to search for alternative energy sources and new concepts. Increasing R&amp;D efforts in the field of the electric vehicle, which seems to become a substantial part of the fleet of automobiles in the years to come, request for automated and simplified design and simulation techniques. The design of the chassis of E-240, a two-seated electric compact city car, developed at the University of Patras with the use of computer aided software tools, is presented here. 940295.

(SP- 1023) Proton exchange membrane fuel cell char- acterization for electric vehicle applications. D. H. Swan, B. E. Dickinson, and M. P. Arikara, University of California. This paper presents experimental data and an analysis of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell system for electric vehicle applica- tions. The dependence of the fuel cell system's performance on air stoichiometry, operating temperature, and reactant gas pressure was assessed in terms of the fuel cell's polarity and power density- efficiency graphs. All the experiments were performed by loading the fuel cell with resistive heater coils which could be controlled to provide a constant current or constant power load. System parasitic power requirements and individual cell voltage distribution were also determined as a function of the electrical load. It was found that the fuel cell's performance improved with increases in temperature, pressure and stoichiometry within the range in which the fuel cell was operational. Cell voltage imbalances increased with increases in current output. The effect of such an imbalance is, however, not detrimental to the fuel cell system, as it is in the case of a battery. 940297. (SP- 1023) Power quality problems at electric vehi- cle's charging station. George G. Karady, Shahin H. Berisha, and Tracy Blake, Arizona State Univ.; and Ray Hobbs, Arizona Public Service Co. An area of electric vehicle (EV) racing which will require sub- stantial study is the racetrack battery charging facility. During the 1993 third Annual APS Solar and Electric 500 race at Phoenix Inter- national Raceway (PIR) the generated current harmonics were mon- itored for various groups and types of battery chargers operating at the time. Measurements were taken on the low voltage side of the single phase supply transformer which supplied the charging station. Input current waveforms were recorded for 26 different chargers. The purpose of this paper is to show measurement results and statis- tically predict what the impact on the racetrack power system when large number of battery chargers are operated simultaneously. A sta- tistical simulation was performed by adding randomly selected com- binations of the digitized current waveforms which had been recorded at the racetrack charging facility. The THD was calculated for each iteration of the simulation. Measurements show that indi- vidual battery chargers generate distorted currents with THD in a range from 10% to 100%. Experimental measurement and simula- tions show that the total current generated by the by the simulta- neous operation of several charges is less distorted than individual charger currents. As the number of chargers increased there was a continual decrease in the THD of the combined currents. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940298. (SP- 1023) Low frequency magnetic field generated at electric vehicle's charging station. George G. Karady, Shahin H. Berisha, and Mukund Muralidhar, Arizona State Univ.; and Ray S. Hobbs, Arizona Public Service Co. The electric vehicle is one alternative form of transportation that has gained importance over the last few years, due, in part, to pollu- tion-free operation. Electric vehicles in their charging mode gener- ate magnetic fields. Over the last few years these fields have been investigated for possible health hazards. A study was undertaken to measure and evaluate the magnetic field generated within a charging station. The 1993 Arizona Public Service Solar and Electric 500, a race for solar and electric vehicles held at Phoenix International Raceway, offered an excellent opportunity to collect data on the magnetic field generated within a charging station. Quantification of the magnetic field is necessary to predict the level of the field, the location where the maximum field is generated, distribution of the field within the charging area, etc. An electric vehicle requires both periodic and fast charging times. These factors necessitate building a large number of charging stations in the future, each with sufficient capacity to service a large number of vehicles simulta- neously. Therefore, the requirements of a charging station were also studied. The magnetic field was measured inside and around the charging trailer, along the charging cords and at four points around each of the electric vehicles in their charging mode. This paper char- acterizes the overall magnetic field generated in the charging sta- tion. The maximum field magnitude measured is 64.37 mG at a dis- tance of 50 cm from the circuit breaker panels. Results show that a low frequency magnetic field is generated. The frequency range for the field is 60 - 420 Hz. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940299.

Although concerns have been raised that the performance of acti- vated carbon canisters will decrease when exposed to air at higher humidities, results of a recently conducted test program do not sub- stantiate these concerns. The results show that the purge efficiency and the working capacity of canisters that are purges with air at 75 grains per pound of dry air (GPPDA) humidity are equal or greater than those obtained with 50 GPPDA humidity purging.

(SP- 1043) The determination of EPA city fuel econ- omy from hot start results. Paul M. Mrozek, DAKO Services, Inc.; and Thomas M. Watson, Ford Motor Co. Most computer simulation models do not predict the transient warm-up characteristics of a vehicle. This paper shows how the standard EPA fuel economy equations can be used to predict city fuel economy from only the "hot start" fuel consumption. The results of 2,550 emission certification tests on gasoline-fueled auto- mobiles were used in the analysis. A plot of the data shows a strong linear relation between cold start fuel economy and hot start fuel economy; R2=99.76%. The regression equation from this compari- son was then used to express EPA city fuel economy as a function of only the hot start economy. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940301. (SP- 1043) Effect of aftermarket PROM chips on vehicle fuel economy and emissions. Jim Lindner, U.S. EPA. In support of the regulations prohibiting the sale of devices which bypass or defeat automotive emissions control strategies, a study was undertaken to compare emissions generated from vehicles using original (OEM) and aftermarket programmable-read-only- memory (APROM) chips. Six different vehicles and chips from three separate APROM manufacturers were tested in this investiga- tion. The driving cycles used in this work were the standard Federal Test Procedure (FTP) driving schedule and a cycle that closely resembled the California acceleration (CA) cycle. The test plan was based on running two OEM emissions tests, followed by two APROM tests, and then a final OEM test. The data were analyzed using an unpaired t-test to compare differences between means. Data for one vehicle was analyzed using a two way analysis of vari- ance to separate driver effects from PROM effects. This was neces- sary due to the use of two different drivers during testing. The APROMs and vehicles have not been specifically identified since this data is still viewed as confidential. However, only one APROM was used per test vehicle so that identification of the vehi- cle will serve as the APROM identification also. On specific vehi- cles there was strong statistical evidence (&gt;95% significance level) for increases in FTP HC up to 27%, FTP CO +59%, FTP NOx +53%, FTP CH4 +17%, and fuel economy decreases of roughly 2%. Generally speaking, all vehicles appeared quite similar when driven on the CA cycle, although CO and NOx was increased 93% and 176% respectively in specific cases. Please note that it is possible to obtain large percent differences when measuring small values such as exhaust emissions. Also, other differences in FTP and CA fuel economy and emissions were seen at lower significance levels. 940302. (SP- 1043) I/M effectiveness as directly measured by ambient CO data. Huel C. Scherrer and David B. Kittelson, Uni- versity of Minnesota. The effectiveness of a centralized Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) program, implemented in a major U.S. metropolitan area in 1991, is directly measured through ambient CO monitor data. A multi- factoral analysis is developed which quantifies effects due to the interaction of hourly traffic levels with wind vector and ambient temperature conditions allowing a better measure of I/M effective- ness. The time-trend of the measured CO levels is seen to closely match those predicted by the analysis throughout the 7 year study period. An average ambient CO reduction of 1.3 ± 1.4 percent attrib- utable to I/M is measured, with individual results of +1.5 percent, +5.8 percent, and -3.4 percent obtained for the three monitor loca- tions studied. 940303. (SP- 1043) Aggregate vehicle emission estimates for evaluating control strategies. Jonathan W. Fox and John B. Hey- wood, Sloan Automotive Lab.; and Gregory J. McRae, Massachu- setts Institute of Technology. Currently, states that are out of compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards must, according to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), develop and implement control strategies that demonstrate specific degrees of reduction in emis- sions-with the degree of reduction depending upon the severity of the problem. One tool that has been developed to aid regulators in both deciding an appropriate course of action and to demonstrate the desired reductions in mobile emissions is EPA' s mobile 5a emission estimation model. In our study, mobile 5a has been used to examine the effects of regulatory strategies, as applied to the Northeast United States, on vehicle emissions under worst-case ozone-forming conditions. We examined the effects of the following mandatory and discre- tionary measures: inspection and maintenance (I/M), enhanced I/M, anti-tampering, reformulated gasolines (RFG I &amp; II), federal tier I &amp; II vehicle standards, California's program of emission standards (LEV, ULEV, ZEV), stage II refueling, and on-board vapor recov- ery (VRS). The rank order of effectiveness, for pollutant reduction, of these measures depends on the pollutant and the time period cho- sen. Two time periods are of interest, near- term (1993-2000) and far-term (2000-2010). In terms of non-methane organic gas (NMOG) emission reductions in the near-term, RFG I is the most effective measure followed by enhanced I/M and then regular I/M with less effectiveness attributable to the remaining programs. In the long-term the benefits from RFG I &amp; II on NMOG emissions are still present; however, they are overshadowed by those from I/M programs and tier I vehicles. The NOx situation is different due to the smaller benefit of reformulated gasolines on NOx emissions. In the short-term the largest benefits come from I/M programs with those from tier I vehicles emerging by the year 2000. In the long- term regular I/M and tier I vehicles are the most significant mea- sures with fewer benefits from enhanced I/M. The results we obtain indicate that the adoption of the California vehicles in the Northeast instead of tier I vehicles, with the other requirements of the 1990 CAAA, would not provide any emissions benefits before the year 2005. This is due, primarily to the reduced benefits of I/M assumed in mobile 5a for California cars. In accordance with this result, the sensitivity of the aggregate fleet emissions to the possible phase-in date of the California cars is small. A separate finding is that the in-use aggregate-fleet emissions of light-duty trucks are not attenuated by fleet rollover as substantially as those of the light-duty passenger cars. Additionally, the relative growth rate in vehicle miles traveled for light-duty trucks is much higher. Thus, the relative contribution of light-duty trucks to vehicle emissions is predicted to increase. 940304. (SP- 1043) Nitrous oxide emissions from light duty vehicles. Vera F. Ballantyne, Peter, Howes, and Leif Stephanson, Environment Canada. Recent evidence has linked vehicle catalysts to nitrous oxide emissions. As the population of catalyst-equipped vehicles increases, so does the need for a better understanding of this power- ful greenhouse gas. Nitrous oxide measurements were made on fourteen vehicles over the FTP urban and highway cycles utilizing an FTIR analyzer. To quantify emissions from aged catalysts, emphasis was placed on testing in-use vehicles with odometer readings between 30,000 and 120,000 kilometers. Tailpipe N2O emissions averaged 126 mg/mile for the nine aged catalyst vehicles and 74 mg/mile for the five new catalyst cars. These results are about two times greater than previous N2O studies using the FTP cycle. Also, twice as much N2O was pro- duced during the urban driving cycle, than during the highway cycle. 35</page><page sequence="35">940304-940311 Based on our measurements, N2O emissions from light duty vehicles in Canada were estimated to range from 8 to 20 kilotons for 1992. Pre-and post-catalyst measurements confirm that N2O is formed during the catalytic reduction process. 940305. (SP- 1043) Hydrocarbon emission sequence related to cylinder mal- distribution in a L-head engine. Tachih Chou and Donald J. Pater son, Univeristy of Michigan. The distribution of fuel-air mixtures in many L-head engines is not homogeneous. If local mixture is too rich or lean, incomplete combustion occurs. This can play a major role in unburned hydro- carbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Fuel-air mixture distribu- tion depends on in-cylinder swirl and turbulence and is directly related to intake manifold configuration, fuel delivery system design and combustion chamber shape. Understanding the spatial mixture distribution may help improve the design of these aforementioned components. Consequently, a more complete combustion process may result, and emissions reduced. A method that measures the emissions of CH and C2 radicals via the use of an optical fiber bundle was used in this research to map the mixture uniformity in the combustion chamber. The intensity ratio (Ic2/Ich) was correlated to the fuel-air equivalence ratio. The mixture distribution measured was then correlated with the hydro- carbon emission sequence. The exhaust gas was sampled by a port mounted sampling valve and analyzed by a FID. Two fuels, propane and Indolene, were used with a Tecumseh horizontal shaft L-head engine. For both fuels, high hydrocarbon emissions early in the exhaust process were identified as resulting from locally overrich mixture in the valve region of the chamber. For propane, the hydrocarbon content of the gases leaving the cylinder last, was independent of mixture distribution and was likely due to wall quenching. On the other hand, for Indolene, mixture mal-distribution was found to con- tribute to the hydrocarbon emission late in the exhaust process. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940306. (SP- 1043) The effects of crevices on the engine-out hydrocarbon emissions in SI engines. Kyoungdoug Min, W ai K. Cheng, and John B. Heywood, Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy . To understand the effects of crevices on the engine-out hydrocar- bon emissions, a series of engine experiments were carried out with different piston crevice volumes and with simulated head gasket crevices. The engine-out HC level was found to be modestly sensi- tive to the piston crevice size in both the warmed-up and the cold engines, but more sensitive to the crevice volume in the head gasket region. A substantial decrease in HC in the cold-to-warm-up engine transition was observed and is attributed mostly to the change in port oxidation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940307. (SP- 1043) Optimization of swirl and tumble in KMC 2.4L lean burn engine. Taehoon Kim, Seokhong Noh, Chulho Yu, and Insik Kang, Kia Technical Center. Incorporating lean burn engine technology has been considered as one of the most promising methods for improving fuel economy and reducing emissions. There has been, however, difficulty in expanding the compatibility region, where both the extension of LML (Lean Misfire Limit) and the reduction of NOx are simulta- neously achieved while keeping satisfactory drivability. The lean misfire limit has been extended by the introduction of swirl and tumble motion. Three types of ports with an IACV (Intake Air Control Valve) have been developed to satisfy seemingly con- tradictory requirements of obtaining sufficient swirl and tumble motion to improve combustion and still keep high volumetric effi- ciency. Effects of newly designed ports with IACV on LML, emis- sions (NOx, THC, CO), BSFC, MBT, were confirmed in a four cyl- inder engine. Tests showed that the combustion duration was short- ened and consequently lean misfire limit and EGR tolerance were improved. Emission level of NOx is considerably reduced. 940308. JPI octane number requirement survey 1982-1992 Japanese model passenger cars. M. Nagashima, Esso Sekiyu K.K.; M. Ishino, Advanced Technology &amp; Research Institute; M. Kagami, Kyodo Oil Technical &amp; Research Center Co., Ltd.; H. Kawaguchi, Tonen Corp.; M. Matsubara, Mitsubishi Oil Co., Ltd.; T. Mori, Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K.; K. Ogawa, Cosmo Research Institute; and I. Tsukuda, Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. Annual surveys on Octane number Requirement (ONR) of Japa- nese model passenger cars have been conducted, and the trend cov- ering the period of 1982-1992 is described as a follow-up of the ear- lier report-SAE 830510. The ONRs showed a gradual decrease until 1990, but increased in later two years, reaching 91.2 and 95.3 ON at 50% and 90% car satisfaction levels, respectively, in 1992. The ONR at high speed range (80-120 km/hr) tended to increase and its differences from the low speed ONR (30-120 km/hr) have become gradually smaller for 1985-1992. Also, engine speed distri- bution at the maximum ONR values shifted to higher speed range above 2050 rmp. Reflecting the recent increasing use of premium gasoline-spec cars, ONR distribution of these cars was separately measured, and resulted in 97.5 and 100.5 RON at 50% and 90% satisfaction levels respectively, in 1992 year model cars. This value is approximately 5 RON higher than regular gasoline spec cars at 90% satisfaction level. 940310. The effect of three-way catalyst formulation on sul- phur tolerance and emissions from gasoline fuelled vehicles. P. Beckwith and P. J. Bennett, BP Oil International ; C. L. Goodfellow, Statoil ; and R. J. Brisley and A. Wilkins, Johnson Matthey. In a collaborative program, the effects of gasoline sulphur con- tent on regulated emissions from three-way catalyst equipped vehi- cles have been studied. The program evaluated the sulphur tolerance of three different catalyst formulations on the same range of vehi- cles. The catalyst chemistries were chosen to be representative of typical current formulations in different markets, as follows: 1 . Plat- inum/Rhodium (Pt/Rh); 2. Platinum/Rhodium/Nickel (Pt/Rh/Ni) and 3. Palladium/Rhodium (Pd/Rh). Each vehicle/catalyst combination was tested with fuels contain- ing sulphur at nominal levels of 50, 250 and 450 ppm weight. All fuels were produced using the low sulphur fuel as a base and doping to 250 and 450 ppm S with a mixture of nine sulphur compounds, typical of those actually occurring in European gasolines. The results show clear differences between the magnitudes of the sulphur effect with different catalyst formulations. Furthermore, it was apparent that several vehicles, fitted with catalysts of identical chemistry and precious metal loading, did not all responde to sul- phur in the same way. It is concluded that the influence of fuel sul- phur content on regulated emissions from current three-way catalyst vehicles in a particular market place depends strongly on the catalyst and engine technology that predominates in that market. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940311. The effect of oxygenates in motor fuel blends on the reduction of exhaust gas toxicity. Andrey Neimark, Vladislav Kholmer, and Eran Sher, Ben-Gurion Univ. The effect of oxygen-containing additives on the toxic emission of a SI engine, has been studied. The relationship between the chem- ical structure of the additives, their oxygen content and molecular mass, and the chemical composition of the exhaust gas toxic com- pounds (CO, HC and NOx), has been established. More than 20 samples of fuel blends containing oxygenates, were tested. The tested oxygenates represent three large chemical struc- ture categories which can be found in the chemical industry wastes -alcohols, ethers and ketones, The tests were performed using a four-cylinder, spark-ignition engine. In order to determine the optimum types of fuel additives for the suppression of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitro- oxygens, fuel blends containing 10% oxygenates with different oxygen con- tent (from 9% to 50%) and molecular mass (from 32 to 170) were examined. It was found that with 30 to 50% additive oxygen con- 36</page><page sequence="36">940311-940317 tent, the CO and HC can easily be reduced by some 60% and 30% respectively, while this was always associated with an increasing in the NOx emission by some 5-10%. The effect of the oxygenate addi- tive on the exhaust gas emissions, was found to be strongly depen- dent not only on the additive oxygen content, but also on the chemi- cal structure of the additive. The CO reduction activity is in the order ketones&gt;alcohols&gt;ethers, while the HC reduction activity is in the order ketones&gt;ethers&gt;alcohols. The NOx increasing reactivity is in the order ethers&gt;ketones&gt;alcohols. 940312. Analytical and experimental evaluation of a ther- mally insulated automotive exhaust system. Dale, L. Hartsock, Ernest D Stiles, William C. Bable, and John V. Kranig, Ford Motor Co. For automotive exhaust system, analytical evaluation of coat- ings, dual wall, multiwall, and blanket insulation methods indicated that the blanket insulation provided the best method for heat con- tainment. An experimental vehicle was tested with and without a blanket insulation on the exhaust system over a demanding heat pro- tection cycle. The exhaust gas, pipe wall, surrounding air, and adja- cent component temperatures at 25 locations along the pipe are reported indicating reduced outer wall temperatures and good con- tainment of the heat. A comparison of the heat lost through the exhaust system walls is presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940313. An alternative tubing and heat shield material for under hood application in the automotive industry. James D. Aston, Clevaflex, Inc.; John O ' Conner, Torrington, Res. Co.; and Parviz Daneshgari, Motor Consultant of America. The future emission requirements for Transitional Low Emission Vehicle (TELV) and Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) will force automobile manufacturers to use extraordinary design mea- sures. Compliance is likely to increase the need for heat shielding. Two system types have been available for some time as design options. These are emission reduction systems such as EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) and A.I.R. (Air Injection Reactor). Both systems create temperature difficulties because of hot exhaust gases. Shielding is needed to insulate other under hood components from high temperature and to retain heat within the emission system. Heat shielding and air conducting tubes have to be flexible, with- stand vibration, resist corrosion from the exhaust gas and endure many cycles of heating over the life of the vehicle. Traditionally stainless steel has been the material of choice. With the increased amount of shielding required for systems in the future a more eco- nomical material will provide large cost savings. A corrugated flexible tube that is a sandwich of fiberglass and stainless steel layers has been developed and tested. The tube is made using an economical, proprietary manufacturing process. Due to flexibility the tubes are formed very easily reducing packaging and assembly effort compared to plain stainless steel. The durability, heat resistance, shielding capabilities and eco- nomics of this new material is discussed. Comparison is made with stainless steel and other materials currently used. 940314. High performance Airgap heat shields using Blow- Molded Roll- Bond aluminum technology. V. H. Scott, Chrysler Corp.; W. E. Swenson and C. W. Fulton, Alean Aluminum, Ltd.; and G. L. Wedekind, Oakland Univ. A new Blow-Molded Roll-Bond (BMRB) aluminum technology has been developed to produce a durable, light-weight, double-wall heat shield with high performance characteristics. The resulting heat shield product is known as an Airgap heat shield. Theoretical results indicate that radiation heat shields should be made from materials with low emissivity and designed to maintain low emissivity levels. Wind tunnel testing showed that Airgap heat shields provide ade- quate thermal protection and road test results verified the thermal performance and durability of these heat shields. This heat shield technology is currently being used for volume production on a minivan platform. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940315. Design of a variable-conductance vacuum insulation. David K. Benson, Thomas F. Potter, and C. Edwin Tracy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory. This paper describes one approach to the design of a variable- conductance vacuum insulation. In this design, the vacuum insula- tion consists of a permanently sealed, thin sheet steel, evacuated envelope of whatever geometry is required for the application. The steel envelope is supported internally against the atmospheric pres- sure loads by an array of discrete, low- conductance, ceramic sup- ports, and radiative heat transfer is blocked by layers of thin metal radiation shields. Thermal conductance through this insulation is controlled electronically by changing the temperature of a small metal hydride connected to the vacuum envelope. The hydride reversibly absorbs/desorbs hydrogen to produce a hydrogen pres- sure typically within the range from less than 10"6 to as much as 1 torr. Design calculations are compared with results from laboratory tests of bench scale samples, and some possible automotive applica- tions for this variable-conductance vacuum insulation are suggested. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940316. Airflow and thermal analysis of underhood engine enclosures. Sami D. Habchi and Simon Y. Ho, CFD Research Corp.; and J. Elder and Sati Singh, Caterpillar, Inc. A numerical model that utilizes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques has been developed for the analysis of underhood engine cooling systems of large slow moving vehicles. Several physical models have been developed and incorporated into a CFD code including; a) a model for predicting pressure losses due to screens and grills, b) a model for approximately the forces exerted by the fan on the flow, and c) a model for calculating the heat trans- fer inside the radiator. The CFD code and physical models have been demonstrated and validated against experimental data. Several three dimensional com- putational grids that represent various engine enclosures have been created and used to analyze the fluid flow and heat transfer inside the engine enclosure system. The computational results are com- pared to test data which were obtained for this study. The results are presented in the form of predicted pressure drop and system total flow rate in addition to velocity vectors and temperature distribution inside the engine enclosure. 940317. (SP- 1040) Flow distribution effects upon air filter performance measurements. R. D. Sabnis, Q. Cai, and F. W. Chambers, Oklahoma State Univ. Problems have been encountered in the repeatability of perfor- mance measurements in the panel filter universal test housing speci- fied by the Society of Automotive Engineers' SAE J726 Air Cleaner Test Code. The flow fields inside the test housing were analyzed for two different sized filters using flow visualization and two compo- nent laser doppler velocimeter (LDV) measurements. The analysis clearly indicated that the flow inside the housing was very turbulent, recirculating and separated from the walls. The filter in the housing receives non-uniform velocities with the central part receiving higher velocities than the sides. Simple filtration theories were applied to calculate the local filtration efficiencies for monodisperse particles for a clean filter. The predicted local efficiencies were inte- grated to give the effect of the non- uniform velocities upon the overall filter efficiency. Calculations predict that for larger particles the filtration efficiencies with a uniform flow distribution are better than with non-uniform flow distributions. For small particles the fil- tration efficiency decreases for the uniform flow distribution. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 37</page><page sequence="37">940318-940326 940318.

(SP- 1040) A descriptive analysis of paper media for the cabin air filtration application. Jan G. Kaukopaasi, Ahlstrom Filtration , Inc.; and Ugo Arbe zzano, Ahlstrom-Bosso. Cellulose-based saturated filter paper media has already for many years successfully been used in different engine filter applica- tions, ranging from auto and heavy-duty air to oil and fuel filters. Paper media has for many years also been used in various segments of the cabin (car interior/compartment) air filter market, primarily within the agriculture and construction industries. Recent studies have illustrated that saturated filter paper can be engineered to meet the challenging technical requirement of the sub- ject application. This paper will provide detailed performance data on new filter paper products designed specifically for small particle removal and high contaminant holding capacity. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940320. (SP- 1040) Practical aspects of testing gas removal fil- ters for cabin air filtration. Steven J. Ilkka, Volker Neveling, and Y. M. Tang , 3M Co. This paper describes the current state of technology for evaluat- ing gas removal filters designed for cabin air filtration. Many automobile manufacturers are aware of the importance of a filtration system to improve cabin air quality. This can be seen by the increasing number of vehicles being produced with such systems in Europe and Japan. The air in the interior of a vehicle contains par- ticulate and gaseous pollutants such as dust, pollen, soot, tobacco smoke, hydrocarbons, oxides of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen (e.g, CO, SO2, NO2), and ozone. To effectively reduce the level of partic- ulate matter entering the vehicle's ventilation system, filters using electrostatically charged media have become the industry standard due to their combination of high particle capture efficiencies, low pressure drop and long life. In combination with these, filters for effectively removing gaseous pollutants are also being developed. The factors affecting the performance of gas removal filters are complex and to properly evaluate their performance a practical, yet technically sound test method must be used. A significant effort has been put forth to understand these factors and a useful test method for measuring filter performance has been developed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940321. (SP- 1040) An experimental evaluation of the factors influencing the performance of car interior air filters. T. J. Ptak, Jon Wake, and Tadeusz Jaroszczyk, Nelson Industries, Inc. In order to be effective in car ventilation applications, an air filter must possess suitable capabilities in each of the following catego- ries: efficiency, pressure drop, dust holding capacity, strength, tem- perature, humidity and chemical resistance. An evaluation method should provide clear information on the filter characteristics in each of these areas. The most important are pressure drop, dust holding capacity, and gravimetric and fractional efficiencies. They depend on the filter media, air flow, air contaminants and environmental conditions. This paper discusses automotive filter environments in order to understand problems experienced in the field. The influence of sev- eral factors involved in car interior air filter performance are evalu- ated. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940322.

The samples were characterized using particle size distributions, elemental analysis, mineral composition and par- ticle angularity. Particle size distributions were determined for sim- ulated fuel cells with intermittent and continual mixing. The results obtained from the world-wide soil sample analyses were compared against AC and PTI SAE fine and coarse test dust results. 940323.

Marinaccio and A. Robertson, Adapco. An extensive calibration study has been initiated to assess the predictive ability of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) for the aerodynamic design of automotive shapes. Several codes are being checked against a set of detailed wind tunnel measurements on ten car-like shapes. The objective is to assess the ability of numerical analysis to predict the Cd (drag coefficient) influence of the rear end configuration. The study also provides a significant base of informa- tion for investigating discrepancies between predicted and measured flow fields and for assessing new numerical techniques. This technical report compares STAR-CD predictions to the wind tunnel measurements. The initial results are quire encouraging. Calculated centerline pressure distributions on the front end, under- body and floor compare well for all ten shapes. Wake flow struc- tures are in reasonable agreement for many of the configurations. Drag, lift, and pitching moment trends follow the experimental mea- surements. The predicted Co levels, however, are higher than the measurements and, despite the fine computational grid, modeling of the rear end flow is incorrect for some configurations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940325.

(SP- 1027) Combustion and emissions characteristics of minimally processed methanol in a diesel engine without igni- tion assist. Thomas W. Ryan, Milan Maymar, and Dale Ott, South- west Research Institute; and R. A. LaViolette, and R. D. MacDowall, EG&amp;G Idaho, Inc. Mixtures of methanol, water and heavier alcohols, simulating "raw" methanol at various levels of processing were tested in a constant volume combustion apparatus (CVCA) and in a single- cyl- inder, direct-injection diesel engine. The ignition characteristics determined in the CVCA indicated that the heavier alcohols have beneficial effects on the auto-ignition quality of the fuels, as com- pared to pure methanol. Water, at up to 10 percent by volume, has little effect on the ignition quality. In all cases, however, the cetane numbers of the alcohol mixtures were very low. 38</page><page sequence="38">940326-940335 The same fuels were tested in a single cylinder engine, set-up in a configuration similar to current two-valve DI engines, except that the compression ratio was increased to 19:1. Pure methanol and five different blends of alcohols and water were tested in the engine at five different speed-load conditions. The engine was operated at conditions simulating turbocharging with no inter-cooling, so that the inlet air temperatures were in the range of 120-145°C. It was possible to achieve auto- ignition on all of the fuels at all five test conditions. The smoke emissions were very low on all fuels at all operating conditions. In addition, the hydrocarbon and nitric oxide emissions were equivalent to the corresponding data for diesel fuel at high load, and higher than the diesel fuel data at light load. There were no systematic differences between the fuels or with neat meth- anol so that it appears that both the water and the heavier alcohols have little impact on the combustion of the methanol. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940327. (SP- 1027) Atomization of coal water slurry sprays. Manikandan Prithiviraj and Malcolm J. Andrews, Texas A&amp;M Univ. The atomization of coal water slurry (CWS) sprays is modeled using the aerodynamic theory of atomization. Several extensions to the theory have been explored to account for the non-Newtonian behavior of the slurry. For comparison with experiment the follow- ing spray parameters are identified; spray angle, intact core length, drop diameters, and velocities of drops and gas. Results from com- puter simulations that use the CWS atomization model have been compared with recent experimental data, particularly with the tran- sient development of the spray. Good agreement between experi- ments and computations has been found. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940329. (SP- 1027) Modeling diesel engine natural gas injec- tion: injector/cylinder boundary conditions. Jianfang Zhang, Roy don. A. Fraser, and Allan B. Strong, University of Waterloo. Direct injected natural gas diesel engines are currently being developed. Numerical analyses results are presented for 20.0 MPa (= 3000 psia; 200 atm), 444 K, natural gas injection into 4.0 MPa cylinder air where the ambient turbulence field is representative of diesel engines. Two very important, non-intuitive, observations are made. First, the seemingly reasonable spatially uniform velocity profile currently used at the injector exit is not appropriate, rather a double-hump profile is correct. Second, a spatially uniform, injec- tor exit, temperature profile results in local temperature overesti- mates as large as 300 K. Considering the strong role of temperature on chemical kinetics, this second observation may have profound implications on the validity of conclusions reached using uniform exit profiles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940330. (SP- 1027) Effective utilization of blended plant fuels in pre-combustion chamber compression ignition engines. Kiyoshi Enoki and Shigenobu Hayashi, Muroran Institute of Tech- nology ; and Norihiro Sawa, Ibaraki Univ. Blended fuels of turpentine oil and castor oil, palm oil, and sun- flower oil have been used as alternative fuels in compression igni- tion, pre-combustion chamber CI engines. The effect of these blended fuels on engine performance, exhaust emissions, and com- bustion process have also been investigated. Here, the effect of higher injection valve opening pressures with blended fuels was investigated, and the behavior of the fuel spray at the higher injec- tion valve opening pressure were observed by a Liquid-Liquid Injec- tion Technique. The fuel injection rate at the higher injection valve opening pressure was measured by the Bosch method. The experimental results showed that: 1) Blended fuels of turpentine oil and plant oils such as castor, sunflower, or palm oils displayed better thermal efficiencies and NOx emissions than turpentine oil, close to the values obtained with diesel oil. 2) With increasing fuel injection, valve opening pressure brake thermal efficiency improved and ignition lag was delayed, and then the combustion instability improves. 3) The Liquid-Liquid Injection Technique showed that spray penetration was longer and that the spray impingement at the wall of the pre-chamber increased with higher injection valve opening pressure and a part of the fuel escapes from the pre-combustion chamber into the main combustion chamber before ignition. 940331. (SP- 101 8) Objective characterization of vehicle brake feel. David G. Ebert and Richard A. Kaatz, General Motors Corp. Historically, vehicle brake feel has usually been evaluated in a subjective manner. If an objective measure was used, it was pedal force versus the deceleration rate of the vehicle. Stopping distance is almost always used to characterize vehicle braking performance by the automotive press. This represents limit braking performance, but ignores braking performance under nor- mal driving conditions experienced by customers most of the time. Evaluation of pedal feel by the press is generally limited to subjec- tive adjectives such as "mushy", "positive", and "responsive". A method will be presented, which is being used by General Motors, to translate customer brake feel expectations into objective performance metrics. These metrics are correlated to actual subjec- tive ratings and are used to set objective, measurable requirements for performance. Having objective requirements allows the use of math based computer models to design systems early in the vehicle development process, which have a high likelihood of satisfying customers. An index has been established which combines various braking feel parameters, with appropriate weighing, to give an overall num- ber which correlates well to customer perception of brake system performance. This number is referred to the "Brake Feel Index" (BFI). 940332. (SP- 101 8) The evolution of the pad guided disc brake caliper. Nui Wang, PBR Automotive Pty Ltd.

Since then over 300,000 units have been produced, in both twin and single piston versions, and have been fitted to vehicles ranging from high performance sports cars to off-road rugged four-wheel- drive trucks. This paper covers both the PGC concept and the development history of the current and the new generation PGC. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940333.

The present evolution of regulated braking requires the knowl- edge and control of dynamic parameters of the vehicle during the braking process. The application we propose is the on-line strain measurement of the braking torque of the caliper support on a disk brake, with in situ signal processing. At the car manufacturer's request we studied an additional version of the measurement system. On the basis of these considerations we defined a low-cost intelli- gent sensor. It may also be applied to other fields for strain and stress measurement. 940335. (SP- 101 8) Weight reduction of disc brake systems with the utilization of new aluminum material. Bernd Neitzel, Michael Barth, and Matthias Matic, ITT- Automotive. Continuously increasing pressure on car manufacturers to improve the fuel economy of future vehicles lead to weight reduc- tion considerations for all components. The reduction of the weight of brake systems requires the utiliza- tion of new materials. 39</page><page sequence="39">940335-940345 The use of ALMMC for rotors seems to be one solution to meet weight reduction objectives. A comparison vehicle test and lab test between conventional grey iron rotors and ALMMC rotors have indicated that aluminum rotors could become a realistic solution for weight reduction. 940336. (SP- 1023) Specific analysis on electric vehicle perfor- mance characteristics with the aid of optimization techniques. P. Frantzeskakis, T. Krepec, and S. Sankar, Concordia Univ. In this paper the effects of design parameters on the performance of an electric vehicle are presented. A detailed mathematical model was established using governing vehicle dynamics equations. Ideal energy storage systems were modeled with high order polynomial equations and represented graphically in the form of Ragonne curves. This was followed by the development of a simulation pro- gram which was utilized to optimize the design parameters, such as specific energy and mass of the storage system, electric motor oper- ating voltage and electric drive final gear ratio. The effects these parameters had on the objective functions, namely range, accelera- tion, specific consumption, battery cycle life and cost were investi- gated. The outlined optimization process is presented in a manner which enables the designer to optimize electric or hybrid electric vehicles. Conclusions were drawn from the simulation and optim- ization results which would yield the best electric drive system for the vehicle in question. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940337. (SP- 1023) The development and performance of the AMPhibian Hybrid Electric Vehicle. Gregory * W. Davis, Gary L. Hodges, and Frank C. Madeka, United States Naval Academy. The design specifications and the results of the performance and emissions testing are reported for a series Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) which was developed by a team of midshipmen and faculty at the United Stats Naval Academy. A 5-door Ford Escort Wagon with a manual transmission was converted to a series drive hybrid electric vehicle. The propulsion system is based on a DC motor which is coupled to the existing transmission. Lead-acid batteries are used to store the electrical energy. The auxiliary power unit (APU) consists of a small gasoline engine connected to a generator. All components are based upon existing commercial technology. 940338. (SP- 1023) The selection of lead-acid batteries for use in hybrid electric vehicles. Frank C. Madeka, Gregory W. Davis, and Gary L. Hodges, United Stats Naval Academy. Lead-acid batteries are currently the least expensive option for use in hybrid electric vehicles. The battery selection process for use in hybrid electric vehicles is complicated due to the limited use of these vehicles. Considerable data exists for the use of lead-acid bat- teries for other purposes. Unfortunately, much of this data is not directly applicable when these batteries are to be used in hybrid electric vehicles. Currently, there exists a wide variation in the type and format of battery data that is provided by the manufacturers. A comprehensive survey of deep cycle lead-acid batteries was con- ducted. Batteries were compared using manufacturers published data. To provide a consistent basis for comparison, various perfor- mance parameters-energy capacity, capacity, weight, and volume were normalized with respect to both weight and volume. Addition- ally, all data was normalized to reflect three hour discharge rates. The battery selection process is then described in detail. Finally, rec- ommendations are presented for the type and format of data that, if provided by the manufacturers, would greatly assist the hybrid elec- tric vehicle battery selection process. 940339. (SP- 1023) Development of the University of Alberta entry in the 1993 HEV challenge. M. D. Checkel, V. E. Duckworth, C. B. Collie, and K. M. W. Workun, University of Alberta. Because of the limitations of their storage batteries, electric cars have always suffered from short range, high weight, and high cost. New battery technologies will provide a significant improvement but all-electric vehicles will still tend to be heavy, costly, and severely limited in range compared with their combustion-engine counterparts. Despite these inherent disadvantages, there is a high impetus for electric car development because of the pollution disad- vantages of the combustion engine. Given the weight/cost/range problems of purely electric cars, it is desirable to develop hybrid cars which have the capability of operating as zero-emission electric cars in urban areas and which use a small internal combustion engine to extend the operating range. The internal combustion engine and its fuel are far lighter, cheaper, and more effective at extending range than carrying enough battery capacity to give an all- electric vehicle a suitable range. The U.S. Department of Energy, Ford, and SAE organized a stu- dent design competition to highlight the possibilities of hybrid elec- tric cars. The University of Alberta, along with 29 other North American university teams, spent eighteen months developing and building safe, practical, road-licensed cars with hybrid electric drive systems. The car developed by the University of Alberta team dem- onstrates the near-term feasibility of the hybrid electric concept and was successful in winning the 1993 HEV Challenge Competition. This paper describes the major design choices and the development process used to produce the University of Alberta vehicle. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940340. (SP- 1023) Hybrid electric vehicle development at the University of California, Davis: the design of Ground FX. Rebecca Riley, Mark Duvall, Robert Cobene, Gregory Eng, Keith Kruetzfeldt, and Andrew A. Frank, University of California. The last few years have been an exciting time for alternative vehicle development. New concerns about the environmental impact of personal transportation and about the United States' dependence on imported oil have pushed energy efficient, ultra- low, and zero emissions vehicles to the forefront of automotive design. Califor- nia's own mandate for Zero Emissions Vehicles (ZEV) takes effect in 1998, creating a tremendous push towards the difficult goal of producing a commercially viable, practical electric vehicle for sale in 1998. Beyond California, most of the world's automakers are simultaneously committing tremendous research and development resources towards the technology necessary for a viable electric vehicle. The University of California at Davis is one of seven California universities participating in the 1993 Ford Hybrid Electric Vehicle Challenge. The Vehicle Design Team in our College of Engineering is one of thirty in the United States and Canada, each developing its own brand of viable two passenger hybrid electric automobiles for this competition. The sponsors of this competition, Ford Motor Co., the Department of Energy, and the Society of Automotive Engineers, have established common guidelines and performance goals for the schools to attain. 940342. (SP- 1028) The emission of PAH from a DI diesel engine operating on fuels and lubricants with known PAH con- tent. Jesper Schramm, Technical University of Denmark; and Shigeo Hori and Tsugio Abe, Japan Ministry of Transport. Engine experiments were carried out in order to investigate the mechanisms involved in connection with the emission of lubricant related polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from a D.I. diesel engine. In the experiments only the mechanisms related to pyrene emissions were investigated, since synthetic fuels and lubricants containing pyrene as the only aromatic compound were used. Particulate matter (PM) and the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of PM as well as PAH emissions were measured for different engine conditions at different levels of pyrene in the lubricant and the fuel. Possible mechanisms of PAH transportation from the lubricant to the exhaust gas are dis- cussed based on the experimental results, as well as the importance of fuel and lubricant to SOF and PAH emissions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940345. Effects of combustion chamber deposits on tailpipe emissions. William H. Bitting, George P. Firmstone, and Charles T. Keller, Texaco R&amp;D. 40</page><page sequence="40">940345-940357 An initial investigation into the effects of combustion chamber deposits (CCD) on tailpipe exhaust emissions has been completed. Four different model vehicles were evaluated for tailpipe emissions at four different deposit conditions. The deposit levels included a baseline clean level, a condition after deposit accumulation, a condi- tion after CCD removal and finally a réévaluation after disassembly and mechanical clean up of the entire intake system. A special rig was developed using a walnut shell blasting device to allow cleaning of CCD without disturbing other engine deposits and without disas- sembly of the engine. This approach was taken to eliminate numer- ous time related variables and focus on the effects of CCD removal. The results of this investigation confirm that directionally HC, CO, and NOx all increased after the deposit accumulation period and decreased with the removal of CCD. However, statistically only NOx emissions increased significantly at the a 90% confidence level. 940346. Combustion chamber deposit measurement tech- niques. Martin K. Megnin and Peter J. Choate, Texaco , Inc. Combustion chamber deposits (CCDs) have been quantified with a variety of methods in the past. Historically, the primary means of quantifying fuel related deposits involved either a visual rating, deposit weight, or an audible method. However, these methods can be time consuming and do not give any indication of actual location or volume of these deposits. A unique method of gaining accurate cylinder head and piston top deposit volumes has been developed and utilized for several years. Data will be shown using the deposit thickness method and its benefits compared to CCD weights, Coor- dinating Research Council (CRC) visual merit ratings, and an audi- ble method. 940347. Honda generators used to evaluate fuels and additive effects on combustion chamber deposits. Charles T. Keller and Keith C. Corkwell, Texaco, Inc. Portable generator sets have been successfully used as gasoline additive screening tools for intake system deposits (ISD) and intake valve sticking tendencies. To assist in the additive development pro- cess, a program was undertaken to determine if the generator sets might also be used to examine additive effects on combustion cham- ber deposits (CCDs). Tests that were performed and evaluated, show that the generator set is capable of discriminating between additives and correlating with engine and fleet testing results with respect to CCDs. This has resulted in a screening test with a single test cycle that can effectively screen fuels and fuel additives for intake system deposits, intake valve sticking and combustion chamber deposits. This paper discusses the engine and fleet tests that are used to show the generator set's ability to satisfy these criteria. 940348. Development of a CRC intake valve deposit test. Sean A. Bannon, Chrysler Corp.; Noyes, L. Avery, Mobil Research &lt;£ Development Corp.; William H. Bitting, Texaco Research &amp; Devel- opment; Graig A. Carlson, Ford Motor Co. ; Daniel T. Daly, Lubri- zol Corp.; Peter Fuentes Afflick, Chevron Chemical Co.; Dean R. Schoppe, EG&amp;G Automotive Research; and Donald V. Swaynos, Exxon Chemical Corp. The Coordinating Research Council (CRC) Intake Valve Deposit Group is evaluating a dynamometer based test to rank fuels for their relative tendency to form intake valve deposits. The Ford 2.3L OHC, dual spark plug equipped engine was previously selected for use in the current test program to determine optimum test condi- tions. A fifteen test design of experiments was constructed to reproduce intake valve deposit weight and morphology, representative of that causing field driveability problems. Test results were analyzed and a two-mode composite test was deduced from deposit weights, visual ratings, observations on the test valves and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results. Once the test was optimized, an additional ten test matrix was conducted to assess both repeatability and the performance of the test over a range of deposit levels. Base fuel and base fuel + two additive combinations were tested to provide a range of deposit ten- dencies. 940351. What is system engineering? Its utility in innovation processes. William M. Spurgeon, Toltec Co. System engineering was developed as a means of dealing with complex products and processes. It provides a conceptual and orga- nizational framework for managing the design, development, manu- facture, marketing, servicing and ultimate disposal of a system such as a passenger car. A theme of this paper is that it also promotes competitiveness by facilitating product innovations. It does this regardless of whether the innovation comes from market pull (cus- tomer needs and wants), technology push, stiffened safety require- ments, or the practice of continuous improvement that has character- ized the automotive industry since its inception. 940355. Laser Welding P/.M for automotive applications. Jack A. Hamill, Jr., Hoeganaes Corp.; and Peter Wirth, Rofin- Sinar, Inc. The ability to laser weld automotive components is a determining factor in converting the currently specified wrought or cast materials to powder metallurgy (P/M) parts for various applications. Material selection, process conditions and joint design are known to have a significant influence when fusion welding P.M components. Weld- ing trials were conducted to determine the appropriate laser parame- ters for several P/M grades at various density levels. Bead-on-plate, overlap and butt joint designs were attempted, primarily without filler metal additions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940356. The evolution of hard turning a P/M differential gear ring. Kevin Ackman, Thomas Farley, and James Zoschg, Pennsyl- vania Pressed Metals, Inc. When performing a hard turning operation, many factors come into play in order to produce a quality part. Questions on tool geom- etry, tool material, tool coating, machine horsepower, spindle tool- ing, rigidity, coolant usage, spindle speeds and tool feeds, heat dissi- pation and gaging equipment, are all unknown factors in a first attempt at hard turning. How we dealt with these factors is the con- tent of this paper. 940357. Enhanced machinability of P/M parts through microstructure control. John J. Fulmer and J. Michael Blanton, Burgess-Norton Manufacturing Co. As the geometric complexity and tolerance requirements of pow- der metal parts become more demanding added machining opera- tions are required as a necessary step in the manufacturing process. Likewise, a better understanding of the effects powder metal materi- als and processes have on the machinability of P/M components is needed. An investigation into the effects of post-sintering cooling rate on the microstructure, machinability and tensile properties of an FC- 0208 copper steel was conducted. Machinability was measured using a drill test on a high volume production component. Three cooling rates (9, 17 and 40 ° C/minute) were used to generate the variation in microstructure. Machinability analysis was performed using box-and-whisker plots and includes drill motor load, hole size on drill entry and exit, and microfinish. Metallography and tensile properties and a discussion of their relationship with machinability are included. Results indicate that the above mentioned cooling rates can pro- duce a measurable difference in microstructure, machinability and tensile performance. A slow cooling rate can be employed to improve the machinability of this material. However, a substantial decrease in tensile properties results. Therefore, care must be taken to properly control the microstructure to optimize both machinabil- ity and mechanical properties for the application of interest. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 41</page><page sequence="41">940358-940367 940358.

François Chagnon, Yves Trudel, and Joel P. Poirier, Quebec Metal Powders Ltd. Drastic reduction of costly machining operations is a definite advantage of powder metallurgy. However, due to design con- straints, many P/M parts still require some machining. For these applications, the machinability of materials becomes an important parameter of the part manufacturing process. Test programs have been conducted at Quebec Metal Powders Limited to characterize the machinability of ferrous P/M materials. The effects of sintered density and alloying elements, namely car- bon, copper and phosphorus, on the drilling thrust force ar presented together with those of machinability enhancing additives such as manganese sulphide and boron nitride. Methods to optimize both strength and machinability of P/M materials are also discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940361. (SP- 101 2) CAN controller architecture optimized for SAE-J1939 applications. Peter Buehring, Philips Semiconductors. An electronic module in a J 1939-compatible network requires to be equipped with an CAN protocol controller, which might be inte- grated on the main CPU or is attached to the CPU as a separate chip. Besides the fundamental functions required to transmit and receive CAN-compatible messages, the CAN hardware can support the CPU effectively, if the typical communication structure of J1939 was respected during the design of the CAN controller. It is shown that the CPU's management of, especially, received messages can be accelerated, if the CAN controller's architecture reflects the internal structure of the J 1939 recommendations. 940362. (SP- 101 2) Propagation delay and oscillator drift analysis for CAN networks. Christopher A. Lupini, Delco Elec- tronics Corp. For a given CAN application the nominal data rate can be pro- grammed in the range of about 5Kb/s to IMb/s. Each bit is made up of programmable segments and programmable sampling and synchronization elements. These parameters may be chosen so as to favorably influence the allowed propagation delay through the CAN link and the allowed oscillator frequency tolerance for a CAN node. This paper will investigate these issues and define several equa- tions that demonstrate the interrelationships of the various CAN bit elements, and the effect that propagation delays and oscillator toler- ance have on the fundamental ability of CAN receivers to success- fully decode a CAN waveform. Graphs are given to illustrate the allowable CAN bus length and oscillator tolerance for various bit rates. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940363.

Mitsunori Kato, Yutaka Matsuda, and Yusaku Himono, Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd.; and Takeshi Nakada, and Yasuhiro Arima, Furukawa Information Technology Co., Ltd. The latency time of class C in-vehicle LAN systems was evalu- ated in order to analyze the difference in latency time between the non-destructive CSMA/CD (CSMA/CD+NDA) and the token pass- ing selected as the high speed LAN protocols. The evaluating method was constructed by combining simulation and an analysis equations. As a result, the limits of traffic volume available for vehicle application were approximately 80 to 90% for the CSMA/CD+NDA and 30 to 40% for the token passing at a transmission rate of 1 Mbps. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940364. (SP- 101 2) A multiplexing communication IC for automotive body-electronic control. Yasushi Shinojima, Masumi Kawakami, and Akira Kawahashi, Toyota Motor Corp. In the field of automotive body electronic control such as control of door locks, power windows, and wipers, there is a growing need of multiplexing communication to reduce the amount of wire har- nesses. To meet this need, we developed a multiplexing communica- tion protocol particularly suited to the body electronic control. Based on the developed protocol, we designed a communication control IC and a simple drive/receiver circuit with a few discrete components. The bus access method of the communication is the CSMA/CD with nondestructive bit arbitration, and its bit rate is 5 kbps. It trans- mission media is a single wire. The communication IC has a multi- plexing control block and a serial I/O block for an interface with a host CPU. It was fabricated using CMOS technology and has a chip of 2.6mm x 3.0mm in size that contains about 5,000 transistors. The driver/receiver circuit consists of one transistor, one capacitor and several resistors. Therefore, the cost of the circuit is quite low. This paper gives a detailed description of the design specification and features of the communication control IC and the driver/receiver circuit. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940365.

Hideki Kimura, Yusaku Himono, and Yutaka Matsuda, Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd.; and Naoki Hiwa, Yoshikazu Nobutoki, Hiroaki Sakamoto, and Tet suya Te rada, Mazda Motor Corp. In order to expand the applicable range of in-vehicle LANs down to popular cars, drastic cost reduction is essential. In addition, an in- vehicle LAN with high transmission rate and advanced functioning is extremely important for the further spreading of vehicle electron- ics intended to enhance vehicle intelligence. We developed the Protocol for Automotive Low and Medium Speed Network (PALMNET) as an in-vehicle LAN system and put it into practical use in 1990. Based on this, we developed a new communication protocol and three ICs for an in-vehicle LAN called the Advanced Protocol for Automotive Local Area Multiplexing Network (Advanced PALMNET), which satisfies the above- mentioned requirements and covers the medium-to-low transmis- sion rate (up to 125kbps) to high rate (up to 1Mbps). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940366.

Lucas has recently developed a multi-master automotive wiring system based on a distributed intelligence network.

Alan Williams and Jim Smith, Lucas Advanced Engineering Centre ; Howard Evans, Lucas Rists Wiring Systems; and John Scholfield and John Elvidge, Ford Motor Company, Ltd. The paper focuses and develops issues raised by the SAE paper "THE FUTURE OF VEHICLE ELECTRICAL POWER SYS- TEMS AND THEIR IMPACT ON SYSTEM DESIGN" and describes the realization of a vehicle with a 12 V architecture of flexible configuration and a power management function. The paper describes the methodology, reasoning and mission behind the creation of the vehicle, developed after collaborative exercises in Europe and the USA, and resulting in a joint program involving a major vehicle manufacturer and a European system sup- plier. The electrical system is becoming the focus of activity world- wide due to rapid changes in vehicle requirements, in the area of safety, environmental and functional demands. There are opportunities for : (a) improve starting; (b) integrated management of power generation and demand; (c) higher system integrity; (d) higher efficiency; and (e) improvement of the vehicle electrical environment, giving benefits in component cost. These areas have formed the main objectives for the program. The emphasis of the discussion will be on the development of the existing 12 V vehicle systems. The focus of the program will be the needs and requirements as seen today and for the foreseeable future, together with the possible functions of a Power Manager System (PMS). The outline workplan for the vehicle is described and proposals for further development are discussed, including the use of simula- tion in the analysis of existing systems and in the evaluation of promising alternatives. The important message from the paper is that an integrated vehi- cle systems approach to the management of electrical power on the vehicle is essential, together with understanding the complex inter- actions between the electrical power supply and the rest of the vehi- cle, whilst recognizing the practical constraints and risk involved in making wholesale changes. Twelve volts will be here to stay for sometime yet; it will need to be considered in a more systematic manner. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940369. (SP- 101 2) Snap-finger design analytics and its ele- ment stiffness matrices. Dhirendra C. Roy, United Technologies Automotive. In the automotive industry, thermoplastic snap-fit designs, are widely used. For various reasons, the related design analytics have become a subject of special interest. The available references offer a limited scope of effectively using analytical methods. In ceratin cases, more rigorous assumptions are needed. Closed form solutions as presented in this paper cover all of the important features constituting the global structure of snap- fingers and deliver exact values of deflections and other results. Other meth- ods like Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or graphical computation could also be adopted to fit certain design environments and profes- sional preferences. Snap-fit designs are occasionally required to meet certain installation efforts, and the necessary evaluation can be done analytically or by using a vector diagram. Getting eignevalues is occasionally difficult. However, column loads and dynamic responses can be estimated by using the Rayleigh-Ritz method of approximation. Organizing snap-fit design analytics could have numerous advantages and constitute the vital step toward possible standardiza- tion of snap-fit designs. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940370.

High density electronic packaging applications will benefit by utilizing this very thin multilayer interconnect construction. Specific advantages include higher packaging density, thinner composite profiles, and flexibility for installation. Especially useful for auto- motive multiplexing applications is the ability to readily combine high density signal carrying capability with high current carrying capacity all in the same compact package. This paper describes an approach to building ultra-thin multilayer circuits in a repeatable high volume production process. Properties evaluated include dielectric strength between layers current carrying capacity, and ability to withstand tight folds in flex-to-install applications.

(SP- 1029) Direct digital control of diesel engines. Minggao Yang, Tsinghua Univ.; and Spencer C. Sorenson, Techni- cal University of Denmark. Initially, a new direct digital diesel fuel injection system: and electronic Pump-Pipe-Valve-Injector system was introduced. A general comparison of this system with other electronic diesel injec- tion systems indicated that the new system can be more effective for high pressure diesel injection and more flexible for wide engine speed range. Then, the digital injection control characteristics of this system were studied by both experiment and computer simulation. Some special digital injection control functions were obtained. In particular, it was found that transient effect of the control valve action can be used to regulate the pulsed diesel fuel flow to achieve a low initial injection rate and high injection cut-off rate. This effect can be optimized by appropriate selection of the control valve loca- tion. Finally, a direct digital diesel engine governing technique was investigated. The theory of discrete systems was applied to model the dynamic transfer characteristic of a diesel engine equipped with the new injection system. A new digital diesel idle speed governing system was designed, which adopted a cascade control structure with both the engine speed at the time of injection and the cycle average engine speed for feedback to synchronize governing action with discrete engine operation events. This system was implemented on a computer and tested on a research engine. Satisfactory govern- ing performance was achieved, and a comparison test between the new control strategy and a conventional PID control method showed that the new system resulted in much better control performance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 43</page><page sequence="43">940373-940379 940373. (SP- 1029) Adaptive air-fuel ratio control of a spark- ignition engine. Brain Ault, V. K. Jones , J. D. Powell, and G. F. Franklin, Stanford Univ. Good control of air-fuel ratio under all operating conditions is essential for low exhaust emissions. In an effort to achieve this goal, an engine model based observer control structure has been applied to a single-cylinder CFR engine. The model includes fuel puddle dynamics, cycle delays inherent in the four-stroke engine process, and sensor dynamics for a universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor. This control structure has been shown to be capable of main- taining the air-fuel ratio within 0.5% rms of the commanded stoi- chiometric value during throttle transients. To achieve this level of performance, accurate values of model parameters such as time con- stants, delay times, and fuel puddle parameters are necessary. Since these parameters tend to vary with engine speed, throttle angle, time, and temperature, a method of periodically updating these parameter values is useful. This paper presents a nonlinear least squares parameter identifi- cation technique which provides accurate values of model parame- ters from data collected during normal engine operation. The inputs are the control signals for an electronic fuel injector and drive-by- wire throttle, while the output is the measurement from a UEGO sensor located in the exhaust manifold. Sensor characteristics and engine air flow parameters are identified during steady-state condi- tions by imposing small dithers about the nominal throttle angle, and fuel puddle parameters are identified during load transients. The identified values are then used in the model-based AFR control sys- tem previously descried to control AFR over a range of throttle angles and engine speeds. Using this self-tuning regulator structure, air-fuel ratio control is demonstrated to follow the commanded stoi- chiometric value within 0.5% rms during various throttle transients with no off-line calibration effort. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940374. (SP- 1029) Model-based adaptive fuel control in an SI engine. Raymond C. Turin and Hans P. Geering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. This paper introduces a model-based adaptive controller designed to compensate mixture ratio dynamics in an SI engine. In the basic model the combined dynamics of wall-wetting and oxygen sensor have to be considered because the only information about process dynamics originates from measuring exhaust X. The control- ler design is based on the principles of indirect Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC). The indirect approach connotes that explicit identification of the system parameters is required for the determination of the controller parameters. Due to nonlinearities and delays inherent in the process dynam- ics, an adaptive extended Kaiman filter is used for identification pur- poses. The Kaiman filter method has already been described in detail within an earlier paper. It proves to be ideally suited to deal with nonlinear identification problems. The estimated parameters are further used to tune an adaptive observer for wall-wetting dynamics. This observer provides us with an estimate for fuel residing in a cylinder, which is actually the quantity to be controlled. In practical experiments, performed on a sequentially injected 3.5 liter, six cylinder BMW engine, the proposed method proves to be a feasible approach to improve transient mixture ratio behavior. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940375.

Nonlinear observer theories are applied to the engine estimation problem in order to reconstruct engine states based on the measured engine variables, and dynamic mean torque production and cylin- der-by-cylinder engine models. Engine cylinder and intake manifold pressures are two important factors in engine control and diagnos- tics.

In this research project, modeling of the dynamic air excess ratio (X) behavior in the exhaust gas at the confluence point in the exhaust manifold was performed. By applying an observer which is one method described be modern control system theory, estimation of the X for each cylinder was carried out using one X sensor. The esti- mated value was used to perform X feedback control for each cylin- der, allowing compensation of deviation in air-fuel ratio between cylinders and individual control of fuel injection volume for each cylinder, dramatically enhancing X controllability. 940377. (SP- 1029) Conventional event based engine control. Elbert Hendricks, Michael Jensen, Alain Chevalier, and Thomas Veste rholm, University of Denmark. Many existing production engine controllers use event (or cons- tant crank angle increment) based sampling and computation sys- tems. Because the engine events are synchronized to the internal physical processes of an engine, it is widely accepted that this is the most logical approach to engine control. It is the purpose of this paper to deal with this assumption in detail and to illuminate various failures of it in practical systems. The approach of the paper is in terms of overall general control system design. That is to say that the problem of event based engine control is considered as a general control problem with its standard components: 1. modeling (engine plus actuator/sensor), 2. specifica- tion of desired performance goals, 3. control system design method selection and 4. experimental testing. It is shown that transport and computation delays, system pumping fluctuations (state noise), sen- sor/actuator characteristics and available design methods make event based systems somewhat less attractive than intuitive precon- ceptions would indicate. Moreover the insights obtained in the detailed study suggest that some improvements of conventional event based control systems are possible. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940378. (SP- 1029) Survey of the electronic injection and con- trol of diesel engines. Ming gao Yang, Tsinghua Univ.; and Spencer C. Sorenson, Technical University of Denmark. The electronic injection and control of gasoline engines has caused a revolution of he conventional four-stroke and two-stroke SI engines. Now, this technique is also playing a more and more important role in the diesel engine area. In this paper, we will focus on the electronic injection and control of diesel engines to discuss injection systems, dynamic models and advanced controls. First, the typical R&amp;D results on first generation and second generation of the electronic diesel injection systems will be reported. Different design approaches will be described. Then, dynamic submodels of the diesel fuel injection systems and dynamic models for the whole diesel engine will be summarized. The main dynamic processes and modelling philosophy will be analyzed. Finally, the advanced diesel governing techniques and diesel man- agement systems will be reviewed. At the end of the paper, some suggestions for further develop- ment an a theoretical summarization on the electronic injection and control of diesel engines will be presented. 940379. (SP- 1029) A new combustion pressure sensor for advanced engine management. Werner Herden and Matthias Kiisell, Robert Bosch GmbH. 44</page><page sequence="44">940379-940386 A new combustion pressure sensor (CPS) for advanced engine management is presented, which is designed to carry out the func- tions: misfire detection, knock control, ignition control, camshaft phase detection and engine roughness control. For small size and high accuracy at a reasonable cost the piezoresistive effect, which is realized within an integrated circuit device and delivers low impedance output signals, has bene chosen. Due to the optimized sensor housing, membrane and force transfer design, the sensor shows little offset drift when affected by flame front and environ- mental thermal stress. This paper describes the CPS and its perfor- mance in comparison with a well-known highly accurate reference sensor. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940380. (SP- 1029) Self-calibrating hall-effect Pilot Timing Sensor for diesel fuel injectors. Marshall Smith and Peter Wolff, Wolff Controls Corp. A new Pilot Timing Sensor (PTS) has been developed that allows the precise determination of the beginning and end of fuel injection in dual-or-single stage diesel engine fuel injectors. The sensor is inexpensive, rugged, small, and easy to maintain and interface. It can be multiplexed or stand alone. It operates at any speed down to zero or to over 10,000 RPM (or to 25 kHz). 940381. (SP- 1029) Evaluation of a spark-plug-integrated fiber-optic combustion pressure sensor. Gang He and Marek, T. Włodarczyk, Optrand, Inc. We present design considerations of a diaphragm-type spark- plug-integrated fiber-optic combustion pressure sensor employing low-cost sensor and optoelectronic components suitable for large- scale production. Sensor system evaluation data are presented for high-engine-load and high-combustion-temperature conditions, and for knock detection. The fiber-optic sensor output closely resembles that of a heat-sunk, flame-shielded instrumentation- grade piezo- electric reference transducer, and demonstrates a high degree of temperature stability. Better than 4% accuracy is demonstrated over a full-scale pressure range. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940382. (SP- 1029) In-cylinder mixture excursions in a port- injected engine during fast throttle opening. Dean Rose and Nicos Ladommatos, Brunei Univ.; and Richard Stone, Oxford Univ. Fast throttle opening in port-injected gasoline engines often results in a lean air-fuel ratio excursion lasting several engine cycles. Even when the engine is equipped with a three-way catalyst this lean excursion can lead to high tailpipe emissions. This paper will describe an in-cylinder method of measuring these air-fuel ratio excursions, using a fast flame ionization detector. Examples will be given of air-fuel ratio excursions obtained on a four-valve-per- cylinder sequentially-injected gasoline engine equipped with a lambda sensor. The air-fuel ratio excursions together with measure- ments of the engine air flow are used t estimate the build up of the fuel film on the inlet manifold walls. Whilst air-fuel ratio excursions have been recorded previously by other investigators, their results were obtained from exhaust gas analysis using fast oxygen sensors. This paper will demonstrate that the duration of the excursions recorded from exhaust gas analysis is overestimated, probably due to mixing of the exhaust gases from successive engine cycles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940383. (SP- 1033) Steady-state cornering behavior of novice and experienced drivers: in case of rear wheel steering vehicle. Kenji Masuda and Masami Nagata, University of Industrial Tech- nology; Hiroshi Kuriyama, Research Institute of Human Engineer- ing for Quality Life; and Takeshi B. Sato, Keio Univ. The skill acquisition process of novice drivers under conditions of steady-state cornering with a rear wheel steering vehicle is com- pared with the visual and control performance of experienced driv- ers. After a short-term training session, the vehicle control skills of the novice drivers were considerably improved. The above findings correspond with the results that novice drivers perform with a front wheel steering vehicle. The visual behavior of the novice drivers, however, presented a striking contrast to that of the experienced drivers. The experienced drivers concentrated their eye fixations on the inside of the course, while the novice drivers paid more attention to the vehicle's direction of travel. 940384. (SP- 1033) Horizontal space judgement of novice and experienced drivers. Masami Nagata and Kenji Masuda, Univer- sity of Industrial Technology; Hiroshi Kuriyama, Research Institute of Human Engineering for Quality Life; and Takeshi B. Sato, Keio Univ. The perceptual performance of horizontal space judgement for novice and experienced drivers is investigated. Two of poles were used for the space judgment. The judgment tasks involved the evalu- ation of three different pole spacings at two separate distances. The drivers were required to judge the possibility of negotiating between the poles. When the drivers were positioned at a long distance from the visual objective, their space judgement between poles was narrower than that when they were positioned at a short distance. When the judgment object was placed at a short distance, the novice drivers tended to judge the space narrower than the experienced drivers. Furthermore, the response time of judgment for the novice drivers whose skill progress speed was slow, became long when he judg- ment object was placed at a long distance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940385. Combustion chamber deposit interference effects in late model vehicles. Stephen M. Moore, Chevron Chemical Co. Certain late model vehicles have experienced an audible clatter- ing during cold engine-start that is caused by the piston top striking the cylinder head after combustion chamber deposits build up to a level that exceeds the available clearance between the piston and the head. This clattering is referred to variously as "carbon knock," "carbon rap," "deposit induced noise," and "combustion chamber deposit interference (CCDI)." The audible clattering intensity increases with mileage as deposits continue to accumulate. An extensive vehicle fleet test program used vibration intensity to quantify the individual impact events that cause the clattering noise. This quantification was used to examine the effects of base fuel, various deposit control additive packages, engine operating conditions, and engine mechanical clearances. The research effort described here involved the testing of 20 vehicles of 5 different makes and accumulated over 900,000 road test kilometers. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940386. (SP- 1033) Model for drivers' perception of vehicle performance. M. A. Passmore and J. C. Wheals, Loughborough Univ.; and A. Patel, Ford Motor Co. A driver's preference for one of two different vehicle models that have the same measurable acceleration may be explained by compli- cated factors such as styling, NVH or ergonomics. If the vehicles have identical appearance but different levels of engine tune, dis- crimination would probably be due to the measurable difference in performance although other factors cannot be entirely discounted. If however, the assessment is made of vehicles with identical appearance and identical performance then andy preference is attrib- utable to an area of human assessment that has been termed subjec- tive performance. This paper discusses the first step in a qualitative approach to the analysis of driver perception of vehicle performance and more spe- cifically investigates subjective performance. The proposed model ascribes distinct components such as induced and perceived perfor- mance to the total subjective performance rating. The model is based upon the analysis of the influence on driving behavior of a single powertrain component (pedal to throttle pro- gression) that previous studies have shown to correlate strongly with subjective performance. Parameters associated with this component 45</page><page sequence="45">940386-940394 were varied by use of a vehicle fitted with a drive-by-wire system (electronic throttle) and were assessed using a novel application of paired comparisons during a test format involving specific maneu- vers and free-driving. Any change in the continuously recorded behavior of the driving subjects was attributed entirely to these parameters and was treated as evidence of induced performance; conversely, high ratings that arose without a significant change in driving behavior were due to perceived performance. In drawing this distinction between modifications which encour- age the driver to drive with greater levels of acceleration and speed and those which make the car feel more powerful without a corre- sponding change in driving style, it is hoped to provide guidelines to direct powertrain development towards the most effective routes for improving subjective performance without necessarily increas- ing vehicle performance. 940388. (SP- 1033) A methodology for evaluating barriers and aids to vehicle ingress/egress. Daniel Koester, Johnson Controls, Inc.; and Richard Hamilton, Ford Motor Co. A methodology for evaluating aids and barriers to vehicle Ingress/Egress (I/E) was developed to assess subject performance with prototype features designed to improve I/E. The measures used included Perceived User Difficulty, Total Time to perform a task, and Observed Body Movements identified during video analysis of the I/E tasks. The observed movements included foot/door interfer- ence, movement discontinuity, trunk rocking, and upper extremity usage. Pilot testing of this methodology showed that subjective and objective user preference and performance data could be measured and that this information provided a more complete understanding of the problems associated with specific prototype solutions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940389. (SP- 1033) Assessment of importance of automotive characteristics by older and younger drivers. Carol S. Saunby and Calvin C. Matle, Ford Motor Co. A study was conducted to rank 34 ergonomie characteristics of automobiles by their degree of importance to older and younger drivers. The older drivers were students in AARP driver eduction classes; the younger drivers were students in university classes. Three geographic locations were sampled. The primary variable analyzed was age, but geographic location, gender, driving experi- ence, and use of glasses were also investigated. Of the characteristics that were found to be of more than average importance to older drivers, seven were appreciably more important to older drivers than to younger drivers with the "control of glare light" being the most dominant. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940390. (SP- 1033) A human factors analysis of optical distor- tion for automotive windshields. Minoru Makiguchi, Tomoaki Shida, Seiichi Sugiura, Kenji Kimura, Eiji Fujiwara, and Yutaka Yamada, Toyota Motor Corp. A very difficult problem exists regarding windshield shape, and that is to create a balance between aerodynamics and optical distor- tion. To assist in solving this problem this study, concerning the characteristics of visual perception for the optical distortion when drivers receive visual information through a windshield, was carried out. In this study, the windshield area was divided into 4 zones from the viewpoints of the level of drivers' fixation frequency and types of objects observed. Distortion was defined as the gap angle (distor- tion angle), which crossed the lines of a grid board with and without a windshield, and distortion angles were measured on a total of 4 windshields. Four drivers indicated areas in each windshield in which they felt the area was distorted. As a result, the thresholds of optical distortion were shown as a function of the horizontal and vertical distortion angles by discriminatory analysis. In addition, it was suggested that the thresholds of optical distortion corresponded with visual contrast sensivity for the spatial-temporal frequency of stimulus luminance about which drivers felt distorted. Finally, we developed a CAD simulation program which enabled estimation of the optical distortion level using windshield shape data, and we used this to investigate effects of the windshield installation angle and driver's eye point on the optical distortion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940391. (SP- 1033) A new automatic optical distortion mea- suring system for automotive windshields. Shigeyuki Seto, Yukiko Nakashita, Ken Uemura, and Takao Kurita, Asahi Glass Company, Ltd.; and Minoru Makiguchi, Toyota Motor Corp. We have developed a system that can measure the distribution of optical distortion over the entire surface of an automotive wind- shield glass as observed from the driver's eye point with high accu- racy by using "distortion angle" as a parameter. This paper intro- duces the system together with examples of measurement result. To measure the position of gratings accurately, we adopt the spe- cially designed video cameras and the method for detecting bright line position based on pixel. To reduce the time required for mea- surement, the filtering process for measured data has been optimized and the data retrieval process has been contrived. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940392. (SP- 101 9) Cyclic variation of CO and CO2 emissions and scavenging flow in a two-stroke engine. Tetsuya Ohira, Suzuki Motor Corp.; and Yuji Ikeda, Takekazu Ito, and Tsuyoshi Nakajima, Kobe Univ. The purpose of this study is to experimentally understand the cyclic variation of combustion state in a two-stroke engine with respect to the variations in scavenging flow and the CO and CO2 emissions. The criteria of grouping combustion states into misfiring was established using the in-cylinder pressure at the crankangle of maximum variability in peak pressure instead of indicated mean effective pressure. The CO and CO2 emissions and the flow velocity variations in the transfer port and the exhaust pipe were measured. Combustion of each cycle was grouped into misfiring, incomplete firing or firing by the criteria of the in-cylinder pressure. In the cycle before misfiring, the CO and CO2 concentration showed high level and the first peak of he exhaust flow showed large velocity and the positive velocity remained for long duration, and the exhaust and the transfer port flow were steeply decelerated to negative velocity mid- way between scavenge port opening and bottom dead center. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940393. (SP- 101 9) Scavenging of a firing two-stroke spark- ignition engine. Bruce J. Tobis, Ford Motor Co.; Robert Meyer, RWTH Aachen; and Jialin Yang, Diana D. Brehob, and Richard W. Anderson, Ford Motor Co. Current demands for high fuel efficiency and low emissions in automotive powerplants have drawn attention to the two-stroke engine configuration. The present study measured trapping and sca- venging efficiencies of a firing two-stroke spark-ignition engine by in-cylinder gas composition analysis. Intermediate results of the procedure included the trapped air-fuel ratio and residual exhaust gas fraction. Samples, acquired with a fast- acting electromagnetic valve installed in the cylinder head, were taken of the unburned mix- ture without fuel injection and of the burned gases prior to exhaust port opening, at engine speeds of 1000 to 3000 rpm and at 10 to 100% of full load. A semi- empirical, zero-dimensional scavenging model was developed based on modification of the non-isothermal, perfect-mixing model. Comparison to the experimental data shows good agreement. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940394. (SP- 101 9) Investigation of the fuel distribution in a two-stroke engine with an air-assisted injector. J. B. Ghandi, P. G. Felton, B. F. Gajdeczko, and F. V. Bracco, Princeton Univ. Results of experiments performed on a direct-injection two- stroke engine using an air-assisted injector are presented. Pressure measurements in both the engine cylinder and injector body coupled with backlit photographs of the spray provide a qualitative under- standing of the spray dynamics from the oscillating poppet system. 46</page><page sequence="46">940394-940400 The temporal evolution of the spatial distribution of both liquid and vapor fuel were measured within the cylinder using the Exciplex technique with a new dopant which is suitable for tracing gasoline. However, a temperature dependence of the vapor phase fluores- cence was found that limits the direct quantitative interpretation of the images. Investigation of a number of realizations of the vapor field at a time typical of ignition for a stratified-charge engine shows a high degree of cycle to cycle variability with some cycles exhibit- ing a high level of charge stratification. Laser diffraction droplet siz- ing was performed in the motoring engine and shows that the air- assist injector produces a very finely atomized spray under condi- tions of early injection when the ratio of injector pressure to cylinder pressure is high. However, when the air rail pressure was decreased larger drop sizes were observed. 940395. (SP- 1019) Non-isentropic analysis of branched flow in engine ducting. Gordon P. Blair , Queen's University of Belfast. Over recent decades many studies have emanated from The Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) regarding the modeling of the performance characteristics of the reciprocating internal combustion engine by following the unsteady gas flow in the ducting and through the cylinder. More recently, the author has published an 'alternative' method of modeling the unsteady flow in the engine ducting together with experimental proof of its accuracy for the sim- ulation of two and four-stroke cycle engines. Not only does the new model impose mass flow continuity at all sections of an engine and its ducting, but is fully non- isentropic in its handling of friction, heat transfer and area changes along any duct. This paper presents a non-isentropic model of flow at a three way branch in a duct, which model expands significantly on previous theoretical approaches from QUB by its capabilities in dealing with mixtures of gases travelling through the branch. This is important for model- ing all engines, but is especially so for the two-stroke cycle. The paper presents theoretical proof of these contentions by modeling significant elements of the exhaust systems of both two- and four- stroke engines and by a full engine simulation of a twin cylinder four-stroke engine. 940396. (SP- 101 9) A generic engine simulation program applied to the development of a V6 automotive two-stroke engine. David Thornhill and Robert Fleck, Queen's University of Belfast. The authors have described the preliminary stages in the design of a V6 automotive two-stroke engine in a previous SAE paper. This paper discusses the application of a gas dynamic simulation model to the development of that engine's design. It is more often the case that papers describing the gas dynamic simulation of an engine dis- cuss relatively simple configurations with only a few pipes and rarely more than one junction. The engine described in this paper comprises 12 junctions in the intake alone. Having compared the model with measured data the program is used to improve the engine design. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940397. (SP- 101 9) Development of a pumpless air-assisted injection system for two-cycle, S.I. engines. R. Gentili, S. Frigo, and L. Tognotti, Università di Pisa. The study and the evolution of a simple air-assisted injection sys- tem for two-cycle, S.I. engines is described. In the first stage of the research the validity of the system was investigated. During this time the system underwent several improvements and modifications. Later, the research was carried on with the following aims: a) to distinguish the spray characteristics by means of a high speed photo- graphic technique; b) to investigate the dependence of such charac- teristics on some parameters of the injection system, and their influ- ence on engine performance, with special regard to fuel economy and exhaust emissions. Finally, the case of fuel vaporization at the outlet of the electroin- jector was investigated. In fact, vaporization and ideal atomization are similar under some aspects and the knowledge of b.s.f.c. and HC emission in the limit case of perfect atomization would give a pre- cise idea of the improvements obtainable through betterments in spray characteristics. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940398. (SP- 101 9) Initial comparison of computed and mea- sured hollow-cone sprays in an engine. C. F. Lee and F. V. Bracco, Princeton Univ. Efforts are reported to reproduce the distribution of liquid and vapor fuel from a pulsating hollow-cone liquid-only injector mea- sured by the planar exciplex technique within the head cup of a motored ported single-cylinder engine operated at 1600 rpm with high swirl and a squish ratio of 75%. The injector, cup and cylinder were coaxial. The measurements show that shortly after the begin- ning of the injection the maximum liquid and vapor fuel concentra- tions are along the axis but also that the spray achieves substantial radial and axial penetrations. The engine flowfield without injection had previously been characterized by LDV and PIV and so had been the injector and its spray in constant pressure environments so that little arbitrariness was left in reproducing the spray in the engine. Two spray models were used. In one the large drops produce by the breakup of the liquid sheet were introduced into the numerical field at the injector exit nearly with the poppet seat angle. In the other, the large drops produced by the liquid sheet were introduced at the end of the liquid sheet nearly with the poppet seat angle and small drops from stripping of the liquid sheet surface were introduced between the injector and the end of the liquid sheet. In neither model was the propagation and motion of the liquid sheet itself explicitly computed. Extensive parametric studies were performed varying: initial drop size and size distribution function, initial drop tempera- ture, amount of residual fuel in the engine, drop drag coefficient and Nusselt number, gas swirl velocity, gas tumble, gas turbulence and numerical resolution but the accumulation of fuel along the axis was never reproduced. The conclusion is always the same: large drops coming in at nearly the poppet seat angle are needed to reproduce the radial and axial penetrations of the spray and they induce a gas flowfield that sweeps along most of the small drops and prevents significant liquid fuel from accumulating along the axis of the spray. It is concluded that one must consider the actual motion of the liquid sheet and its gradual collapse toward the axis so that the large drops that it generates start with nearly the poppet seat angle but end being projected right along the axis. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940399. (SP- 1019) CFD prediction of a two-stroke, in- cylinder steady flow field - An experimental validation. N. R. McKinley, R. G. Kenny, and R. Fleck, Queen's University of Belfast. LDV is used to measure steady flow in a two port loop scavenged model two-stroke engine cylinder. The model cylinder machined from acrylic for maximum optical access, is geometrically identical to that used in a previous dynamic study of transfer port efflux vec- tors. The measured flow field is compared with a CFD prediction which employs experimentally measured velocity, mass flow rate, and turbulence intensity as the inlet boundary condition at the trans- fer port. The finite volume prediction, using the PHOENICS general purpose code recreates the global flow pattern well, but shows some local discrepancies in flow direction and magnitude. Levels of tur- bulent kinetic energy were poorly recreated using a k-e model of tur- bulence, especially around impingement of the incoming jets where local errors of up to 60% were seen. 940400. (SP- 101 9) A stepped-piston two-stroke engine for high altitude applications. Eran Sher and Michal Zeigerson, Ben- Gurion Univ. The crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle engine is preferred in cases where low weight and high power output are paramount requirements. These qualities are most important in small pilotless 47</page><page sequence="47">940400-940410 aircraft. It was found that the main problem in the use of two-stroke cycle engines for this purpose, is a sharp decrease in the engine power with the increase in altitude. This is attributed not only to the low density of the ambient air, but also to the deterioration of the efficiency of the gas exchange process. In order to improve the engine performance at high altitude, it is proposed here to employ a stepped-piston engine. The engine is constructed of a stepped piston and a single stepped cylinder thus forming three compartments; a power, a compression and a crank- case compartment. In this arrangement, the fresh charge is com- pressed in the compression compartment before it enters the crank- case compartment. A computer program, the MICE (modeling Internal Combustion Engines) program, was modified to consider this type of engine, and used to study the effect of various parameters on the engine perfor- mance. A geometry optimization for maximal performance was per- formed. It is shown that a significant improvement in the engine perfor- mance map at high altitudes can be obtained with the stepped-piston engine. The optimized engine can function well at 5,000 ft. (-1,500 m) higher than the conventional engine, while its specific fuel con- sumption at low altitudes is well below the conventional one, thus increasing the aircraft mission range. 940401. (SP- 101 9) In-cylinder gas velocity measurements comparing crankcase and blower scavenging in a fired two- stroke cycle engine. Paul C. Miles, Robert M. Green, and Peter O. Witze, Sandia National Laboratories. The in-cylinder flow field of a Schnlirke (loop) scavenged two- stroke engine has been examined under conditions simulating both blower and crankcase driven scavenging. Measurements of the radial component of velocity were obtained along the cylinder cen- terline during fired operation at delivery ratios of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. Both mean velocity profiles and root mean square velocity fluctua- tions near top center show a strong dependence on the scavenging method. Complementary in-cylinder pressure measurements indi- cate that combustion performance is better under blower driven sca- venging for the engine geometry studied. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940402.

(SP- 101 9) Hydrocarbon modeling for two-stroke SI engine. P. Ramesh Babu, B. Nagalingam, and Pramod S. Mehta, Indian Institute of Technology. Hydrocarbon emissions due to short-circuiting of the fresh charge during scavenging process is a major source of pollution from the two-stroke spark ignition engines. This work presents a prediction scheme for analysis of hydrocarbon emission based on the material balance considerations. A generalized form of globular combustion equation has been used for general applicability of the scheme to any fuel or fuel blends. The influence of mixture quality, scavenging characteristics, residual contents and the delivery ratio are predicted. A good qualitative prediction has been established at all delivery ratios. The predictions are found quantitatively satisfac- tory in the higher delivery ratio rang where the short-circuiting phase of the scavenging process is dominant. 940404.

This paper presents the design and prototyping work involved in the development of a new, lightweight Mg seat back frame. The major objectives were to produce a lightweight, cost compet- itive strong dual passenger bench seat, that would integrate a three point belt system for both occupants. Sand cast AM and AZ alloys were used to fabricate functional prototypes, that were used to test the actual diecast design. The com- plexity of the geometry and the high ductility characteristics were adequately reproduced, as shown during the testing. Applicable FMVSS tests were performed on the prototype seats with positive results. The objective of the prototypes were to achieve 80 to 85% of the diecast properties, to allow rapid design changes at low cost and provide the first parts within a tight sched- ule. 940405.

This paper describes the method and technology in which a com- bination of extruded and stamped magnesium components were used to develop a lightweight seat frame for use in automotive and/or aircraft industries. A current production steel frame was used as a base model for packaging comparison. A prototype sample was made based on simple design practices which, when tested, resulted in fatigue failure. A non-linear Finite Element Analysis was con- ducted which suggested some minor changes. Additional samples were than made and tested. The seats' s performance data from tests conducted and a computer model from the Finite Element Analysis is submitted. An economic and manufacturing feasibility study was conducted to investigate the potential of such a system for high vol- ume production. The results suggest that positive benefits will be obtained in the area of increased payloads and more efficient gaso- line consumption by using a magnesium seat frame compared to an existing steel or plastic seat frame. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940409.

Dry machining of five commercial magnesium alloys with alu- minum content in the range 2-9% has been investigated by turning tests. At high cutting speeds, workpiece material may build up on the flank sides of carbide tools (FBU). The critical speed for FBU formation is dependent on the presence of ß-phase (mg^Alu). The amount of ß-phase increases with increasing aluminum content, and depends on the temper condition of the alloy. The formation of FBU can be eliminated by the use of a suitable cutting fluid or a PCD tool. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940410.

(SP- 1022) Investigation of the quality and corrosion resistance of recycled AZ91D magnesium ingot. Gary A. Rozak, Garfield Alloys Inc. Recycled magnesium ingots were processed by Garfield Alloys, Inc. and evaluated for compositional consistency, corrosion resis- tance and microstructural integrity. Ingots were batch processed from recycled (new) scrap materials. Primary ingots (Dow Chemical Co.) were subjected to a similar evaluation. Chemical analysis was conducted on a spark spectrometer, while corrosion resistance was measured with salt spray testing (ASTM B 1 1 7). Ingot microstruc- tures were inspected with an emphasis on grain structure and discon- tinuities. Recycled AZ91D ingots behaved similar to the primary ingots in this test sequence. Spectrographs test results of the ingots were not comparable to the batch analysis; lower levels of aluminum and zinc were indicated. Corrosion rates of the ingots ranged from 0.59 to 1.1 and 0.40 to 0.90 mg/cm2/day for the recycled and pri- mary ingots respectively. 940413. (SP- 1022) High purity magnesium die casting alloys: from ingot to cast product. Ola v H olía and Hâkon Westengen, Hydro Research Center ; and Darryl Albright, Hydro Magnesium Marketing. The current strong interest in magnesium alloy die castings for automotive applications relies heavily on the "High Purity" con- cept. The basic knowledge of-the detrimental effects of heavy ele- ment impurities on the general corrosion of magnesium alloys has been known for more than 60 years. However, it was not until the 1980' s that the full potential of high purity alloys was recognized. The level of impurities (in particular, cooper, nickel and iron) that can be tolerated in a die cast part exposed to a corrosive environment necessitates careful control throughout the complete manufacturing process, from ingot to finished product. In the present paper, some basic principles for the production of high purity alloys and the influence of subsequent melt handling practice in the die casting shop are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940414. (SP- 1036) The effect on aerodynamic drag of the lon- gitudinal position of a road vehicle model in a wind tunnel test section. K. P. Garry, Cranfield Institute of Technology; K. R. Coo- per and A. Fediw, National Research Council; S. B. Wallis, Ford Motor Co. ; and D. J. Wilsden, Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. It is not generally appreciated that the longitudinal position of a road vehicle model in a wind tunnel can have a significant influence on its measured aerodynamic drag. This paper explores the influ- ence of the proximately of the end of the test section on measured aerodynamic drag, where the 'end' of the test section is defined by the start of the first diffuser or the end of a separate groundboard. Both flat plates and three-dimensional, automotive shapes were tested in three different model-scale and full-scale wind tunnels. It was found that the drag began to change from its upstream, undis- turbed value when a vehicle model was closer than a distance of four times the square root of its base area from the end of the test section and that large changes occur when a vehicle model was closer than twice the quare-root of its base area to the end of the test section. The effect is attributed to base pressure changes in the proximity of the diffuser or of the end of a groundboard. It is suggested that this effect may have contributed to some of the lack of correlation observed between wind tunnels and that it may be partially responsi- ble for the lower drag levels measured in short-test-section, open-jet wind tunnels, when compared with closed-wall wind tunnels. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940415. (SP- 1036) On the induced flow noise of test sections in different wind tunnels and in the cabin of a passenger car. E. Mercker and K. Pengel, German-Dutch Wind Tunnel. An acoustic comparison test of eleven European and two Ameri- can full-scale automotive wind tunnels was carried out with a pas- senger car. The scope of investigation comprised in-flow and out-of- flow background noise measurements of the empty test sections as well as interior noise measurements inside the passenger compart- ment of a standard type Volkswagen Passat Variant CL. For this purpose seven different vehicle configurations were investigated in the various wind tunnels. The aim of this experimental investigation was to establish phys- ical criteria in order to carry out a suitable acoustic comparison between wind tunnels with different types of test sections and to establish upper limits of wind tunnel background noise levels where acoustic measurements inside a passenger compartment are ques- tionable. 940416. (SP- 1036) The Chrysler 3/8-scale pilot wind tunnel. Gary F. Romberg, Chrysler Corp.; and James A. Gunn and Ronald G. Lutz, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. The Chrysler 3/8-scale model automotive wind tunnel is a pilot facility for a planned full-size tunnel of the same design. The 3/8- scale tunnel, which has a complete compliment of instrumentation including a pressure system and high-precision balance, will also be used for 3/8 model aerodynamic development testing of vehicles after piloting is complete . The tunnel is convertible from a slotted- wall test section to a semi-open jet test section. Commissioning, cal- ibration, and piloting results show the performance of some features being piloted including slotted- wall effectiveness, open jet collector performance, and tunnel background noise levels. Calibration results include static and dynamic pressure distributions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940417. (SP- 1036) Aeroacoustic testing improvements at Pininfarina. Antonello Cogotti, Industrie Pininfarina s.p.a. Aeroacoustics is playing an increasing role in the development of new passenger cars. However, most existing wind tunnels, with few recent excep- tions, have been designed and built with little or no attention to their aeroacoustic aspects. Building new wind tunnels with excellent low noise levels is technically feasible today, however it is not often justifiable from an economic standpoint. In the case of the Pininfarina wind tunnel, built in 1972 without any specific noise target, a decision was taken in 1984 to progres- sively upgrade the facility and the acoustic measuring techniques. A target of reaching a background noise level low enough to allow satisfactory acoustic development work on new cars, with the con- temporary use of more modern measuring techniques, was estab- lished. This decision implicitly assumed that, to do this development work, it is not necessary to reach the very low noise levels of a pure acoustic wind tunnel. The paper reports a short description of the main modifications made to the facility, in the years 1985-90, and the main results obtained. Then, it describes some of the new measuring techniques which have been set up in the meantime. They are optimized so as to be as efficient as possible in the presence of the background noise. This noise has a relatively low level and a favorable spectrum when com- pared with other aerodynamic wind tunnels, but this noise still remains worse than that of the acoustic wind tunnels. In order to further improve the existing situation, a new three- year research program has been recently started (mid 1992). 49</page><page sequence="49">940417-940427 Its main aim is to improve the capability of detecting the noise sources on the outer surfaces of cars. To do that, new measuring techniques are in course of development and testing. At the same time, further modifications to the facility are going to be carried out, mainly to its fan-drive system, to reduce the back- ground noise level. An overview of this new research program is reported in the sec- ond part of the paper, together with some examples of the latest experimental results. 940418. (SP- 1036) A further evaluation of the ground-plane suction method for ground simulation in automotive wind tun- nels. G. W. Carr, MIRA; and W. Ecker, Porsche AG. For wind-tunnel measurements of drag and lift on passenger and racing-car models, correlations have been established between results obtained with a stationary ground-plane, with and without boundary-layer-suction, and a moving ground-plane. Compared with the stationary-ground-plane results without suc- tion, the application of suction caused significant reductions in lift. These reductions were smaller, though, than those obtained with the moving-ground-plane, particularly in the case of rear-axle lift force. The influence of ground-plane suction on drag was also less than that of the moving ground-plane, which induced small drag increases. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940419. (SP- 1036) Recent developments of experimental techniques and their applications at NASA Langley Research Center. Scott O. Kjelgaard and William L. Sellers, NASA Langley Research Center. The need for highly accurate measurements of velocity, tempera- ture, pressure and density has required the development of new experimental techniques. While the majority of these development efforts at NASA Langley are focused toward applications for aero- nautical programs such as the High-Speed Civil Transport, Advanced Subsonic Transport, and the National Aero-Space Plane, a number are applicable to other fields. The intent of this paper is to review recent instrumentation developments and applications at NASA Langley Research Center that may have applications in auto- motive testing. Five experimental techniques are described along with recent results obtained in NASA facilities. 940420. (SP- 1036) A detailed drag study using the coastdown method. M. A. Passmore, Loughborough Univ.; and G. M. Le Good, Rover Group Ltd. This paper describes a technique for determining the components of vehicle drag based on the well established coastdown method. Using onboard anemometers to continuously measure the ambient wind input and a sophisticated analysis procedure the method makes it possible for small changes in vehicle configuration to be analyzed. The experimental technique and analytical approach are described and discussed in detail, and the accuracy achieved and that expected in further tests is highlighted. 940421. (SP- 1036) Drag measurements on 2,3 &amp; 4 car pla- toons. M. Zabat, S. Frascaroli, and F. K. Browand, University of Southern California. Wind tunnel tests are conducted using l/8th scale models of a standard U.S. mini-van to study the effect of inter-vehicle spacing on the drag of each of the vehicles in 2, 3 &amp; 4-car platoons. The wind tunnel has a ground plane equipped with boundary layer con- trol provided by means of suction over a homogeneously porous sur- face. Internal, 3-component force sensors are used to measure drag, side force, and yawing moment on each model. Drag coefficient of an individual vehicle alone is about 0.33. When spacing between platoon members is greater than about one vehicle length, the inter- action among members is relatively weak. The drag of the lead vehi- cle is unaffected by the presence of other platoon members; each succeeding vehicle exhibits a lower drag coefficient. For spacing less than 1 vehicle length, drag coefficients are reduced for all mem- bers of the platoon, although the interior members experience the greater savings. At a spacing of half a vehicle length, the average drag coefficient in a 4- vehicle platoon falls to 0.62 of the non- pla- toon value. 940422. (SP- 1036) An experimental study of the aerodynamic interference between road vehicles. A. F. Abdel Azim, Zagazig Univ. An experimental study of the aerodynamic interference between road vehicles during the passing process was performed. 1/10 scale models for a truck and a semi-trailer were employed. Static type testing was followed. Thus, eleven relative longitudinal positions between both vehicles were examined in a wind tunnel. Moreover, to investigate the severity of close proximity of vehicles, four lateral spacings between both vehicles were considered. The pressure distribution over horizontal planes of the circumfer- ence of both vehicles were measured separately at first for each vehicle. Next, these measurements were repeated forty- four times for each vehicle to account for both longitudinal and lateral relative positions between both vehicles. The difference in the pressure coef- ficient Cp over both sides of each vehicle furnishes the side force and yawing moment on each vehicle. The sensitivity of the small vehicles to both influences, leads to a drift from its path. Moreover, the corresponding side force and yawing moment of the trailer about the hitch point of the semi- trailer, leads to its turn around the hitch point. Consequently the safety and stability of the nearby vehicle is critically influenced. 940423. Steel powders for high performance automotive parts. R. A. Chernenkoff, D. W. Hall, and S. Mocarski, Ford Motor Co.; and L. F. Pease, Powder-Tech Associates. Increased use of powder-forged connecting rods in the automo- tive industry prompted an investigation into the suitability of pow- ders from different suppliers for this application. Specifications developed by North American users call for ultra clean powders to enhance machinability and fatigue life. Powders from four manufacturers were each blended with graph- ite and lubricant, then pressed, sintered and forged to full density. Metallographic samples were prepared and evaluated for inclusion content. In addition, the powders were mixed to the composition of connecting rods, (C-0.5%, Cu-2% and MnS-0.3%), and were simi- larly pressed, sintered and forged. Test bars were machined from the forged discs. Uniaxial fatigue tests were performed in the tension- compression mode and strain-life curves were developed. It was determined that all powders examined were very clean and were comparable in their inclusion content. Fatigue test results have shown that all four materials had strain-life curves within a narrow scatterband. It was concluded that all four powders examined are suitable for forging high performance automotive parts. Thus, con- necting rod manufacturers have freedom of choice in regards to sources of the base raw material for these highly stressed parts. There is also an adequate supply of powder for conversion of steel connecting rods to powder metal. 940427. Powder injection molding airbag sensor components. Anime s h Bose, Parmatech Corp. For safety and protection against life threatening automobile accident injuries, the use of airbags in automobiles is on the increase. Currently, there are two competing sensors in use: the Electronic Sensors (ES) and the All Mechanical Sensor (AMS). Powder injection molding (PIM) has been used to fabricate two key components (Firing Pin and D-Shaft) for the AMS devices. This paper discusses some of the powder injection molding processing issues and attempts to demonstrate the capabilities of this unique process (PIM) in the fabrication of small and complex shaped parts that can be used by the automotive industry. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 50</page><page sequence="50">940428-940436 940428. The processing, properties, and applications for alu- minum powder metallurgy materials. Kevin Couchman and Clem Cousino, Pennsylvania Pressed Metals, Inc. Aluminum powder metallurgy (P/M) has been the subject of renewed attention recently. This is driven by the need to reduce weight, improve efficiency (such as fuel economy), and reduce costs. A review of the materials available, how they are processed, and how they perform, as compared to wrought and cast forms, will provide a current status in aluminum P/M technology. Some insight will be given into the direction of future technology. 940429. The Northstar cam bearing caps: A new application for aluminum P/M. Jim Foss, General Motors Corp.; and David DeFranco, Powder Metal Products, Inc. A new application for the use of aluminum powder metallurgy in automotive engines has been developed. The duel overhead cam Northstar engine which began production in the 1993 model year uses aluminum metal powder for he camshaft bearing caps in the cylinder head assembly. The material was chosen because it offered the opportunity to eliminate both the machining operations and the capital required for the machines when compared to traditional die cast bearing caps. Tolerances for the P/M cap were essentially the same as those for traditional machining operations, and from a func- tional perspective, they performed equally as well as the die cast parts. 940430. Automotive main bearing caps manufactured by powder metallurgy. Mark A. Jarret, General Motors Powertrain; Terry M. Cadle, Zenith Sintered Products, Inc.; and William L. Mil- ler, General Motors Powertrain. Powder metallurgy main bearing caps (MBC) are being used in General Motors 3 100 and 3800 engines with over 1,500,000 bearing caps assembled to date. Powder metal was chosen to replace nodular iron because of its functional advantages and because its net shape capability eliminated major investments in bearing cap machining lines at General Motors. This paper explains the functional advantages of powder metal bearing caps. Grey cast iron, nodular cast iron and powder metal bearing caps are compared. Main bearing cap requirements of strength, fatigue life and consistency are discussed. The various experiments and durability tests used to develop powder metal caps are described. 940431. IM240 repair verification: an inexpensive dynamom- eter method. Jan B. Mickelsen and William B. C lemme ns, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An inexpensive system was designed that would allow repair shops to verify the adequacy of repairs made to cars that had previ- ously failed the new high-tech I/M test (IM240). Before and after repair tests on a limited number of vehicles were performed with both official IM240 and prototype repair grade (RG240) equipment systems. Analyses were performed to determine if the RG240 sys- tem concept is capable of determining if the repairs performed resulted in adequate emissions reductions to assure a passing IM240 retest. This study focuses on development of a prototype RG240 system consisting of a 100 SCFM CVS, a dynamometer with an eddy current power absorber and non- adjustable 2000 pound inertia flywheel, and a BAR 90 emissions analyzer with an additional nitric oxide analyzer. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940432. Overcoming the limitations of the system architec- ture of on- board vehicle diagnostics. Moshe Gray, Edge Diagnos- tic Systems. Today's automotive service technicians use on-board diagnostics (OBD) as the primary diagnostic tool in diagnosing faults in com- puterized vehicle systems. However, owing to the inherent limita- tions of the system architecture of OBD, the scope and accuracy of the diagnostic information available from it is frequently insuffi- cient. This paper describes a new category of "intelligent" off- board diagnostics (OFBD) designed to cost-effectively supplement the diagnostic capabilities of OBD by providing the diagnostic informa- tion and functionality OBD is incapable of. It also examines the lim- itations to advancing the system architecture of OBD, and why OFBD is now the only solution to overcoming those limitations. Fully self-contained and infinitely software-configurable, the OFBD system is driven by a comprehensive VIN-based perfor- mance specification database, enabling both OEM systems develop- ers and the automotive service industry to design and integrate into it virtually unlimited expert analysis capabilities. It connects in series with the vehicle system under test, enabling it to monitor every signal entering and exiting the PCM (ECM/ECU). The OFBD system is equipped with special circuitry to allow it to break signal circuits to take complete control of the vehicles system's various functions. This enables the OFBD system to isolate and verify the integrity of all the components and signal circuits comprising the vehicle system, including the PCM itself. 940433. The integrated service system. Kevin E. Flood, AI Squared, Inc. The increasing emphasis on the quality of service is forcing orga- nizations to re-thing their strategies on developing and deploying automated service systems. Particular attention is being given to integrating conventional technologies with more advanced knowl- edge-oriented technologies. These new integrated service systems pose some interesting challenges in their development and deploy- ment. This paper will provide some insight into why an integrated sys- tem is important. It will discuss the various technologies that are part of an integrated system and offer suggestions on how an organiza- tion would implement such a system. It will also cover the potential impact of the implementation of an integrated system on an organi- zation. 940435. New polyolefin based elastomers for TPO impact modification. S. P. Chum, H. C. Silvis, and C. I. Kao, Dow Chemi- cal Co. A new family of homogeneous polyolefin copolymers can be produced by Dow' s INSITE Technology. These ethylene/octane based, designated as polyolefin plastomers (POP) and polyolefin elastomers (POE), exhibit many unique physical and mechanical properties due to their narrow composition distribution (i.e. como- nomer distribution and molecular weight distribuiton). In addition, the INSITE technology also allows for the production of homoge- neous copolymers with a controlled level of long chain branching (LCB) along the polymer backbone. This unique molecular structure results in many improved rheological properties, such as enhanced shear thinning and high melt elasticity, and improved polymer melt processability. Additionally, the unique rheological properties of the INSITE Technology polymer (ITP) also provide improved disper- sion capability in rubber modified polypropylene (PP) blends. Ther- moplastic polyolefins (TPO) containing (ITP) elastomers have excellent low temperature impact strength and injection moldability. The performance and impact toughening mechanism of the ITP impact modified PP will be discussed in this paper. 940436. Mechanism and prevention of winter discoloration of light- colored PVC exterior trim. Bryan M. Kazmer, Craig L. Shoemaker, David A. Ernes, and James F. Daly, Geon® Co. In recent years, trends towards monochromatic styling have increased the use of body side moldings matched to panel paint col- ors. These moldings can be painted to match, but are increasingly using pigmented flexible poly (vinyl chloride) to improve durability and reduce part cost. Even complicated "special effect" colors like metallics and pearlescents are now matched in pigmented vinyl. However, after several winters in severe climates like the Great 51</page><page sequence="51">940436-940446 Lakes region, some white moldings were observed to be noticeably yellowed. Since white is the most popular choice of car buyers, this is particularly troubling. The effect proved to be difficult to consis- tently reproduce in laboratory experiments. This paper will describe work done at The Geon Company to identify the likely chromophore via analyses of staining road "slop" and yellowed moldings. This paper will then describe the proposed mechanism whereby the chromophore appears in the part. The relative roles of transport and chemical phenomena in creating the observed effect will be pro- posed. Last, this paper will show how the yellowing can all but be elimi- nated by designing the plastic compound so as to retard and interrupt the proposed mechanism, while retaining other desirable physical and chemical properties. 940437. Polyurethane structural foam for automotive spoiler applications. Gene Symosko, Miles, Inc. Recent developments have shown that polyurethane structural foam materials work well in exterior trim applications. In the past, these materials had been considered mainly for interior applications. However, new designs in spoilers have shown that they are also an excellent choice for exterior trim components as well. In reviewing these spoiler programs, physical properties, processing, and design advantages will be discussed. By using the polyurethane structural foam process, spoilers can be molded which are single components, are light-weight, and have good physical properties. These materials also require less postfinishing and can be painted with conventional paints. 940438. Global standardization of the acquisition and pre- sentation of comparable data on plastics. H. Breuer, BASF AG; M. H. Tiba, DiiPont de Nemours; R. Shastri, Dow Chemical Co.; S. J. Itkin, Ford Motor Co.; P. M. Sarnacke, Dow Chemical Co.; R. A. Latham, DuPont Polymers &amp; Automotive; W. B. Hoven- Nievelstein, BASF Corp.; K. S. Mehta, Miles, Inc.; J. S. Kennedy, Hüls America, Inc.; J. A. Grates, Hoechst Celanese ; and G. P. Diehl, GE Plastics. One of the problems faced by design engineers, as well as anyone involved in resin selection in the automotive industry, is access to comparable data among similar products from different material suppliers. This stems from the lack of standardization in the acquisi- tion and reporting format for materials properties data in the plastics industry. Currently, a multiplicity of national test standards are widely used in the acquisition of materials properties data, which often allow a broad flexibility in the choice of test specimen shapes and geometry, conditions for preparing the test specimens, test vari- ables, and test conditions, as well as units, rendering any compari- son between materials extremely difficult. ISO 10350, and 11403 parts, 1, 2 and 3 were developed specifically to address these issues for the acquisition of the data and the CAMPUS® database was developed as a tool for standardization of the reporting format for plastics properties. These efforts are well suited to meet the growing need of the automotive industry for comparable data on a global basis. The key benefits are cost savings to both the OEMs and the material suppliers. This paper will discuss how these objectives are achieved by the worldwide standardization efforts and the experi- ence gained to date. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940440. Low thermal expansion plastic alloy for exterior parts. J. Koizumi, T. Okumoto, H. Mizutani, and Y. Shichida, Toy oda Gosei Co., Ltd. Recently, R-PP (Rubber modified Polypropylene) has been often used in automotive exterior parts, but is difficult to use for longer parts because of the limit of its dimensional stability. Studies of the thermal expansion mechanism of R-PP by the rule of mixtures and FEM indicated that optimization of the volume elas- ticity ratio of PP/rubber is a key point to design the low thermal expansion alloy. And the selection of rubber which is partially com- patible with the PP is also important., The developed new alloys are used for automotive longer exte- rior parts such as the rocker panel and side moldings which have bet- ter dimensional stability than the usual R-PP and R-RIM (Rein- forced Reaction Injection Molding). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940441. New bonding techniques to enable use of TPE in win- dow encapsulation. Torsten Röder and Frédéric Drujon, Saint- Gobain Vitrage. Thermoplastic-Elastomer Material (TPE) was chosen for the encapsulation of an automotive glass. Therefore primer-systems have been developed to guarantee a good bonding between glass pane and TPE-polymer. Adhesion tests were performed on quarterlites and on specimen to obtain answers concerning the behavior of these primer-systems even after different aging storage. This application for TPE will allow automotive manufacturers to replace PVC-compounds for window encapsulation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940444. (SP- 1015) The influence of mixture preparation on a warm 1.9L Ford engine. Charles H. Daniels, Ford Motor Co.; and Lawrence W. Ever s , Michigan Technological Univ. An experimental technique was used in evaluating the influence of mixture preparation in the intake port on the performance of a steady-operating, 1.9L Ford engine. The fuel preparation compo- nents investigated in this study were vapor, droplets, and liquid streams. Engine performance was evaluated in terms if in- cylinder pressure and exhaust gas emissions. Fuel vapor, small droplets (Sauter mean diameter less than 10|im), and liquid streams were produced and varied in a carefully-controlled mixture preparation system, which delivered an air/fuel mixture to an engine test cylin- der. The air/fuel mixture was saturated prior to delivery to the cylin- der so as to stabilize the fuel preparation components for study. Also, incorporated in the preparation system were devices for physi- cally measuring the amount of fuel in the form of droplets and liquid streams. For a load of 50 kPa and a speed 1500 rpm, the effects of mixture preparation were evaluated for IMEP, COV imcp,10- 90% Burn Angle, HC, CO, CO2, NO, NOx, and exhaust O2 at a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. Results of the study generally showed that engine per- formance was significantly diminished by increasing the amount of fuel in liquid stream form (i.e. more wall-wetting). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940445. (SP- 1015) The behavior of multiphase fuel-flow in the intake port. Gang Chen, Michael T. Vincent, and Terry R. Gutermuth, Chrysler Corp. Most of the current fuel supply specifications, including the key parameters in the transient fuel control strategies, are experimentally determined since the complexity of multiphase fuel flow behavior inside the intake manifold is still not quantitatively understood. Optimizing these specifications, especially the parameters in tran- sient fueling systems, is a key issue in improving fuel efficiency and reducing exhaust emission. IN this paper, a model of fuel spray, wall-film flow and wall- film vaporization has been developed to gain a better understanding of the mulitphase fuel-flow behavior within the intake manifold which may help to determine the fuel supply specifications in a multi-point injection system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940446. (SP- 101 5) Fuel film dynamics in the intake port of a fuel injected engine. Mary Comben Bourke and Lawrence W. Evers, Michigan Technological Univ. 52</page><page sequence="52">940446-940451 Up to 80 percent of the total hydrocarbons emitted during the EPA Federal emissions test are produced in the first five minutes of this procedure. It has been theorized that this is in part due to wall wetting of the intake port and cylinder. This study measures the behavior of the fuel film thickness in the intake port during cold starting, steady state and transient operation. Three injector spray patterns with varying droplet sizes were utilized for the tests. The fuel film thickness in the intake port of a Ford 1.9L engine was measured using optical sensors. It was found that the spray pattern and droplet size affected the port wall wetting charac- teristics. 940447. (SP- 101 5) Measurement of the wall-wetting dynam- ics of a sequential injection spark ignition engine. Christopher H. Onder and Hans P. Geering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. In this paper the fuel path of a sequentially injected gasoline engine is discussed. Since a fraction of the injected fuel suffers a delay due to the wall-wetting phenomenon, in transient phases a sig- nificant deviation of the air-to-fuel ratio from its setpoint can arise. The amount of fuel on the manifold wall and its rate of evapora- tion cannot be measured directly. Therefore, the effects of the wall- wetting on exhaust lambda and engine torque have to be considered for the identification of the dynamics. The dynamics of the exhaust-gas-oxygen (EGO) sensor is not negligible for the interpretation of the lambda measurement. Since both the dynamics and the statics of a Zr02 Sensor are very nonlin- ear, a normal EGO-sensor is not suitable for these investigations. On the other hand, the engine torque is a good measure for the cylinder lambda when all other effects which lead to torque changes can be eliminated. The engine torque has to be calculated from the load torque and the resulting engine speed. On a dynamic engine test bench step response and frequency response measurements are used for the identification of the wall- wetting dynamics. The measurements are executed on a 6- cylinder 3.4 liter BMW engine with sequential injection. In sequentially injected engines, a wall film can be located at each intake valve. These parallel dynamic systems are multiplexed in input and output as well. This effect can be shown clearly in the measurements. A mathematical model taking into account the multiplexing is given and the parameters are identified. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940448. (SP- 101 5) The effects of various engine control sys- tem malfunctions on exhaust emissions levels during the EPA I/M 240 cycle. Ahmed Soliman and Giorgia Rizzoni, Ohio State Univ. Ensuring the reliable operation of the emissions control system is a critical factor in complying with increasingly stringent exhaust emissions standards. In spite of significant advances, the perfor- mance of available diagnostic and test equipment is still amenable to further improvement, especially as it pertains to the diagnosis of incipient and intermittent faults. This paper presents experimental results pertaining to the diagno- sis of complete, partial and intermittent faults in various components of the engine emissions control system. The instrumentation used in the study permitted simultaneous and essentially continuous anal- ysis of the exhaust gases and of engine variables. Test were con- ducted using a section of the EPA urban driving cycle (I/M 240), simulated by means of a throttle/dynamometer controller. Various faults were induced in the engine control system (e.g., vacuum leaks, misfire, miscalibrated injectors) in an attempt to approximate realistic fault conditions and their effects on the exhaust emissions during the I/M 240 cycle were quantified. The paper also proposes procedures capable of isolating the defective components(s) using model-based fault detection strate- gies in conjunction with a set of logical rules, representing a compi- lation of available diagnostic and design experience. The overall aim of this study is to provide a useful framework for the design of diagnostic instruments that will help in the improvement of the qual- ity of high volume emissions inspection lanes and to provide accu- rate and reliable diagnostic information. 940449. (SP-1015) New variable intake and mixture forma- tion system for multi- valve SI engines. H.-J. NeuBer and H. Endres, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH &lt;&amp;. Co.; and M. Breuer , Insti- tute of Applied Thermodynamics. To meet the future challenges of reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, load and speed dependent control of mixture for- mation and the combustion process are necessary. Although variable intake systems will contribute to this issue, current designs are char- acterized by costly deactivation mechanisms and have sensitivity to production tolerances. In this paper, a new type of variable intake and mixture formation system is presented, which offers a new, economical and reliable way to control mixture formation and charge motion. A theoretical analysis was done to determine the best geometric dimensions and subsequent experimental results demonstrated the best potential strategies for reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions through improvements in lean burn capability and EGR-tolerance. Compared to conventional port deactivation systems, all control features have been realized with a reduced number of required parts. Flexible mixture formation is achieved with a combination of single point (SPI) and multi point (MPI) injection which, in combination with a novel deactivation method, provides the potential for a high level of EGR tolerance as well as lean burn capability. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940450. (SP-1015) Further development of solenoid operated gas injectors with fast opening and closing. Harry Kekedjian and Tadeusz Krepec, Concordia Univ. The existing state of the art in solenoid operated injectors tech- nology promotes their use mainly for gasoline manifold injection in spark ignition engines. The attempts to use such injectors for direct fuel injection are hampered by slower and less repeatable dynamic response, as compared with hydraulically or mechanically operated diesel injectors. Also, the impact of the solenoid overheating and the resulting loss of power, is considered detrimental for such injectors when installed in the cylinder head of an engine. The next (third) generation of solenoid operated injectors is dealing with all these disadvantages. First, it is using a special inductive driving circuit for the solenoid to boost the opening of the injector needle by amplify- ing the supply voltage, but only for a very short instant of time. Sec- ond, it is utilizing the differential angle in the conical needle seat to reduce the unbalanced pressure force acting on the injector needle when closed; this allows the injector to open at higher gas pressure or to use stronger return spring to accelerate its closing. The paper explains the principles of these improvements and simulates the injector's behavior on a computer. 940451. (SP-1015) Developement of the module type fuel fil- ter. Katsuhisa Yamada , Hideo Kamo , Hiroshi Ueda, Kouji Izutani, and Yoshihiko Ohya, Nippondenso Co., Ltd. In recent years, concerns with global environmental problems have become major issues. Environmental regulations such as fuel consumption/economy, for example, have become very stringent. On the other hand, the pursuit of a comfortable and spacious passen- ger compartment and reduced engine compartment room have become more progressive. Size and weight reduction of automotive components are necessary to cope with these requirements. With regards to the fuel filter, size reduction of the filter element is the key technology to achieve both component size and weight reduc- tion. As to a fuel filter, the reduction of its size and weight can be accomplished by reducing the size of its element. We have studied this subject and have invented a new type of element structure. Additionally, we have developed a new filter paper which features a favorable combination of contaminant holding capacity and micron rating. 53</page><page sequence="53">940451-940458 Based on these studies, the development of a new type fuel filter (Module-Type fuel filter) has been completed. The new Module- Type fuel filter paper offers a 40% reduction in size and a 30% reduction in weight, when compared to a conventional fuel filter. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940452. (SP- 101 5) A critical study of the dual versus single plug systems in S.I. engines. Harish Chandra, Automotive Research Association of India. Dual spark plugs are occasionally employed on certain modern S.I. engines operating with very lean fuel-air mixtures, or with larger proportion of EGR, or on engines operating in other conditions which are difficult to ignite. Different researchers have advanced different reasons for gains due to dual spark plugs; namely, shorter flame travel distance, change in flame speeds and shapes, etc. According to the hypothesis proposed by the present author, the exact cause of the gains due the dual plug system is different from that put forth by the other researchers. The hypothesis states that, in adverse engine operating conditions when the success rate of spark ignition is poor, the presence of two spark plugs increases the probability of generation of the self-sustaining flame kernel thereby reducing the probability of misfires. The hypothesis is proved by conducting a brief parametric study using a validated mathematical model. Furthermore, the hypothesis forms the basis of the explana- tions to the behavior of certain dual plug engines resulting in a con- sistent and acceptable description of the engine behavior. 940453. (SP- 1020) Emissions control technology for locomo- tive engines. Christopher S. Weaver and Douglas B. McGregor, Engine, Fuel, and Emissions Engineering, Inc. This paper reports some results from a study of emissions control for railway locomotives performed for the California Air Resources Board. Feasible and cost-effective control techniques for locomotive emissions include retarding injection timing and other engine modi- fications, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), use of liquified natu- ral gas (LNG) fuel with low-emission dual- fuel or spark-ignition (SI) natural gas engines, LNG combined with SCR, and electrifica- tion. Use of a combination of dual-fuel and SI LNG engines could reduce locomotive NOx emissions by 80%, at a cost of less than $1, 100 per ton of NOx eliminated. SCR added to diesel and LNG could produce NOx emission reductions of 90 and 97%, respectively, as costs less than $3,300 per ton. All of these technologies could be retrofit to existing diesel locomotives. Electrification of line-haul locomotive operations would give an even greater NOx reduction, but the cost would be ten times that of the next most expensive option, and the incremental NOx reduction over the best non- electric approach would be small. Railway locomotives constitute one of the largest remaining uncontrolled NOx sources in many areas, including California. The objectives of the study reported here were: 1. to identify a set of feasible and cost-effective techniques to reduce locomotive emissions in California to the greatest extent pos- sible at an acceptable cost; 2. to characterize the technical requirements, costs, emission impacts, and impact on railway operations of each technique in suf- ficient detail to serve as a basis for regulation; 3. to identify and recommend areas where ARB or other public funding for additional research, development, and demonstration of specific techniques are required in order to make them available for widespread application; and 4. to develop and recommend a regulatory strategy and imple- mentation schedule for reducing locomotive emissions in California as quickly and cost-effectively as possible, and estimate the emis- sion benefits which would result. This paper presents some of the main results and conclusions of the study. More detailed information is given in the final report to the Air Resources Board. 940454. (SP- 1020) Ceramic trap system for passenger cars. K. N. Pattas, Aristotle University; S. H. Lee, Changwon Carburetor Co.; K. R. Cho, Korean Ministry ' of Environment; S. G. Papa- dopoulos, Hellenic Vehicle Industry; and N. A. Kyriakis, Aristotle University. An automatic forced regeneration ceramic trap system with throt- tling before the trap, using Ce based fuel additives, for installation on light-duty diesel passenger cars is described. The system was installed on two vehicles and tested in the laboratory. The repeata- bility of the back pressure variation due to the soot accumulation during successive FTP cycles was determined, and the operation period of the system was defined. The operation of the system in both applications was equivalent to about 35 km of urban driving. The filtration efficiency approached 80% in FTP cycle and 90% in ECE and JAPAN 13 mode tests, while gaseous emissions and fuel consumption were practically not affected by the system. 940455.

Several previous SAE papers have discussed the direct on-line soot measurement device that uses radio frequency (RF) technology to measure filter soot loads in diesel particulate filters. This paper presents differential pressure measurement data from several differ- ent retrofit vehicle applications using various filter geometries.

Hideo Yoshikawa, Chiba Institute of Technology; Takashi Ikeda, SRI International East Asia; Kazu- toshi Haraguchi, Dai Nippon Ink Chemical Inc.; Tetsuo Kawamura and Masatomo Tanaka, Chiba Institute of Technology; and Tateo Yamaguchi, Godo Technical Service Corp. This study relates to the simultaneous reduction of NOx and soot exhausted from direct injection diesel engine. With use of the surface treated carbon fiber, NOx is significantly reduced through the adsorption and chemical conversion into N2 and CO2. With use of stainless steel nets connected with the cathode and electro conductive material composed of Cu coated cloth, carbon fiber and stainless steel net connected with anode of the car battery, soot is collected electrically and is easily removed and combustible into CO2. The test result operated with 500 ml D.I. diesel engine shows excellent performance of NOx and soot at more than 50% reduction with the long recycle life of the used material. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940458.

EAO (Ford European Automotive Opera- tions) 1.8 liter Sierra Turbo-Diesel passenger car is investigated. Plain and Pd catalyzed monolith wall flow diesel particulate traps are examined using Phillips No. 2 diesel fuel (Reference Standard), low sulfur (0.05%S) diesel fuel and an ultra-low sulfur (0.001 %S) diesel fuel. Comparisons are made with baseline FTP75 and High- way exhaust emissions and Federal and CARB mandated particulate standards for 1997 and 2003. Effectiveness of catalyzed traps, plain traps, copper octoate trap regeneration fuel additive, and fuel sulfur content on the particulate emissions is determined. On the basis of limited durability tests, cordierite wall flow filter traps of 100 cpi and 0.432 mm (0.017 in.) wall thickness having palladium catalyst on exit channel surfaces, with 0.1 3gm Cu/liter fuel (0.5g Cu/gallon) with Cu as copper octoate fuel additive for trap regeneration, dem- onstrates capability for reducing diesel particulate emissions to well below the stringent 1997/2003 particulate emission standards, with low (0.05% S) and ultra low (0.001% S) sulfur fuels. This investiga- tion identifies a potential means for reducing NOx emissions. How- ever, the NOx standards still pose a formidable challenge. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940459. (SP- 1020) Pre-turbo application of the knitted fiber diesel particulate trap. A. Mayer, TTM; R.-M Schmidt, H. Sud- manns, and P. Mattes, MTU ; and A. Buck, TSP. The development of particulate-traps for big engines is more dif- ficult than for automobile applications. The usual placement, after the turbo-charger, necessitates complex solutions to challenges in size, flow distribution and regeneration. The placement of the partic- ulate trap ahead of the turbo-charger has technical and financial advantages, and has previously been extensively investigated, but did not prevail because of poor reliability of the monolithic traps. This paper investigates the knitted fiber trap, a mechanically and thermically dependable unit, developed for integration into the engine. A modular design makes the trap very compact. Filtration rate and pressure loss are satisfactory. The filter element has not shown any weakness. A typical deficiency of this application, that needs further investigation, is worsening of the engine's transient response by the thermal inertia of the filter material. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940460. (SP- 1020) Control of diesel soot, hydrocarbon and NOx emissions with a particulate trap and EGR. Yiannis A. Levendis and Iraklis Pavlotos, Northeastern Univ.; and Richard F. Abrams, CeraMem Corp. This study demonstrated the concept of using exhaust gas recir- culation (EGR), coupled with a high-collection efficiency particu- late trap to simultaneously control smoke, unburned hydrocarbon and NOx emissions from diesel engines. Although EGR technology has been extensively used in gasoline engines, its application to die- sel engines has been hindered by the particulate content of the recir- culated exhaust gas. Even with the use of conventional ceramic monolith filters, with soot collection efficiencies in the range of 50-80%, the exhaust stream is not adequately clean for recirculation to the engine. This investigation used a high soot collection effi- ciency Ceramem filter to make EGR possible. This ceramic filter is coated with a thin microporous ceramic membrane to provide soot removal efficiencies in the order of 99%. Aerodynamic regeneration of this filter not only provided low-temperature failure-free opera- tion but, also drastically reduced the unburned hydrocarbon emis- sions by promoting their condensation on the soot, as was demon- strated earlier. This feature is important since EGR often increases unburned volatile hydrocarbon emissions, since it reduces both the in-cylinder oxygen concentration and temperature. 940461. (SP- 1020) An aerodynamically regenerated diesel particulate trap with a flow-through soot incinerator section. Sandeep Mehta, Frederick Oey, Christianto Sumbung, Chester Li, and Yiannis A. Levendis, Northeastern Univ. The development of an Aerodynamically Regenerated Trap (ART) with a flow-through incinerator section is discussed herein. The ART system presented herein employs a single high-collection efficiency ceramic monolith fo filter particulate emissions. Regener- ation is performed aerodynamically, using compressed air flowing in the direction opposite to the exhaust flow. Dislodged particulates are captured in the incineration section of the trap directly below the ceramic monolith, where they are burned using an electric heater. This work concentrates on the design an development of the inciner- ator sections of the diesel particulate trap, whose function is to retain the soot from the regeneration air stream, without impeding the flow of the regeneration air itself. Three variations in the design of the incinerator chambers were developed: (a) a dead flow system, (b) a flow- through system with a secondary revolving-disk filter, and (c) a completely passive flow-through cylindrical secondary filter. The secondary filters in the flow-through designs are used to clean the regeneration air itself and retain the soot in the chamber for burn- ing. The evaluation of the ART systems was conducted with the aid of a computational fluid dynamics package and extensive road tests. All systems were constructed and road- tested in a diesel-powered vehicle. The trap that was fitted with the cylindrical secondary filter proved to be the most reliable and effective. It solved the problem of the conflicting needs of unobstructed flow of regeneration air through the trap and of soot retention for subsequent burning in an incineration chamber. These incineration chambers may replace the fiber bags used in earlier versions for collecting particulates from the regeneration air. 940462. (SP- 1020) A new design of monolithic particle filters with transverse isotropic property for diesel motors. Chu-Wan Hong and Ulrich Weiss, Mercedes-Benz AG; and Nils Claussen and Dierk Götz Feldmann, Technische Universität Hamburg-Harburg. The monolithic DPF made of cordierite ceramic has unsatisfac- tory on his fatigue or long-term strength. A new design of configura- tion of plugs combined with the hexagonal channels shows a trans- versely isotropic property, and can remove the anistropy of mono- liths with square channels. This anistropy is assumed to be one of main reasons for the failure of monoliths with square channels regarding the experimental results. Considering the honeycomb structure as a homogeneous material based on the Boltzmann con- tinuum can't give the correct behavior of this structure in a FEM simulation. Another homogenization procedure using the Cosserat theory has been discussed. The FEM stress analyses with structural detail-models show that the maximal tensile stresses in the monolith with square channels exist in the diagonal (i.e. 45°-) direction, or on the edges of channels. This feature is identical with what the theory has predicted and the experimental results have shown. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940463.

(SP- 1044) New technology for reducing the power consumption of electrically heated catalysts. Takehisa Yaegashi, Kouji Yoshizaki, Tetuo Nagami, and Shigeki Sugiura, Toyota Motor Corp.; Tohru Yoshinaga, Nippon Soken, Inc.; and Katsuyuki Ohsawa, Toyota R&amp;D Labs. A new heating strategy for electrically heated catalysts has been developed which reduces power consumption while achieving the desired hydrocarbon conversion. The relationship between catalyst volume and power consumption is presented. Observations of cata- lytic reactions by a thermoviewer camera and mathematical simula- tions are used to optimize the heating pattern. Significant reductions in power consumption, while maintaining conversion efficiency, are reported by heating only the front face of the catalyst. However, prior to mass production additional work is required to improve durability, and reliability and to resolve manufacturing issues. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940465. Ultra-low power electrically-heated catalyst system. Paul F. Küper, Porsche AG; and Wolfgang Maus, Helmut Swars, Rolf Brück, and Friedrich W. Kaiser, EMITEC GmbH. Compliance with future emission standards in the United States of America, California in particular, and in Europe, will require cat- alytic converter modifications to achieve increased effectiveness of emission treatment. A significant factor is cold start behaviour. At least one part of the catalytic converter must be catalytically active shortly following start of the engine - about 15 seconds in the FTP (federal test procedure) test, i.e. achieve operating temperature in this frame - in order to attain ULEV values. As has frequently been indicated in the past, the heated catalytic converter is one possible solution for achieving future standard values. In the course of devel- opment, modifications to heated catalytic converter and exhaust sys- tems, as well as engine management, have successfully lowered energy consumption by post-heating to between 1.5 and 2 kW. It can be seen that numerous applications of various heated catalytic con- verters successfully achieve the target area HCcULEV values at a heating energy of &lt;30 Wh. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940466. (SP- 1044) A structurally durable EHC for the exhaust manifold. H. Mizuno, F. Abe, S. Hashimoto, and T. Kondo, NGK Insulators, Ltd. It is well known that an EHC (Electrically Heated Catalyst) is very effective in reducing cold start HC emissions. However, the large electric power consumption of the EHC is a major technical issue. When installed in the exhaust manifold, the EHC can take advantage of exhaust heat to warm up faster, resulting in a reduced electric power demand. Therefore, a structurally durable EHC which can withstand the severe manifold conditions is desirable. Through the use of an extruded monolithic metal substrate, with a flexible hexagonal cell structure and a special canning method, we have succeeded in developing a structurally durable EHC. This new EHC installed in the exhaust manifold with a light- off catalyst directly behind it demonstrated a drastic reduction in FTP (Federal Test Procedure) Total HC emissions. Even after severe engine aging equivalent to 50,000 miles (850°C x 100 hours with a fuel cut mode), emissions continued to be reduced by more than 50%, with less than 2kw of post heat, when tested in a 2 liter engine car. This low wattage and durable EHC can be a practical solution to meet LEV/ULEV regulations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940467.

Gibbs, William J. Webster, Robert Johnson, and Gerald Wilson, New York State Automotive Emissions Laboratory. A low thermal mass, metal monolith, catalytic converter, was tested for reducing automotive emissions for applications both as lightoff and main converters. FTP testing was carried out to measure the first four minutes of Bag 1 emissions for a 2.2L, fuel-injected Plymouth Reliant, at New York State, Automotive Emissions Labo- ratory, Albany (NY-AEL). The car had approximately 17,000 miles when tested and its driving history had been catalogued by NY- AEL. Both resistively heated and non-resistive mini-converter sys- tems were tested in series with a conventional replacement new automotive converter. The non-resistive converter reduced HC, CO and NOx emissions by more than 50%, 40% and 30%, respectively, despite excess air addition. Lightoff occurred within 10 seconds of engine start. A modified cycle exploring steady state conditions under load showed greater than 70% reduction in NOx. The resistively-heated converter system further reduced THC, CO and NOx emissions, with lightoff occurring even earlier, without any pre-crank heating. Short-term durability of the catalyst and substrate was demon- strated through SEM and micrographie testing of the substrate from the test converter. The stock converter, aged for 17,000 miles, was compared against the replacement new converter and the performance drop is reported. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940468. (SP- 1044) Optimization of extruded electrically heated catalysts. Louis S Socha, Jr. and David F. Thompson, Cor- ning Incorporated ; and Phillip A. Weber, Southwest Research Insti- tute. Low mass extruded electrically heated catalysts (EHC) followed directly by light-off and main converters resulted in non-methane hydrocarbon emissions (NMHC) between .020 and .023 g/mi at power levels as low as lkw and energy levels as low as 4whr. These results were achieved on a 1993, 2.2 liter vehicle. The success of this system is due to rapid heat up of the catalyzed surface areas of both the heater and light-off converter. The energy added to the exhaust from both the heater and the light-off is then efficiently transferred to the main converter. In additions, the impact of power and energy on NMHC levels was determined. The Ultra-Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) stan- dard was also achieved with uncatalyzed heaters and on a 1990, 3.8 L vehicle. The new California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards require a significant reduction in tail pipe emissions compared to current standards. One of the big- gest challenges is achieving the non-methane organic gases (NMOG) level for the LEV and ULEV standards. Many strategies have been studied to achieve lower cold start tail pipe hydrocarbon emissions such as electrically heated catalysts, hydrocarbon storage devices, light-off converters, and exhaust gas ignitors. Electrically heated catalysts have received the most attention and have been demonstrated to be an effective solution. Previous EHC systems yielded low emissions but they required unacceptably high power and energy. Coming's development efforts have been focused on continuing to achieve low emissions while significantly lowering power and energy. This paper will discuss the development of new EHCs and systems which operate at significantly lower power and energy levels. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940469. (SP- 1044) Concepts for ultra low emission vehicles. Karl Kollmann, Jörg Abthoff, and Wolfgang Zahn, Mercedes-Benz AG. To achieve low emission levels, the handicap of the TWC is its^ light-off characteristic. It achieves a maximum hot efficiency of nearly 100%, but this requires a temperature in the range of 300 to 450°C. To improve this time lag after cold start, the TWC needs additional help to reach the targets of future low (LEV) or ultra low emission (ULEV) levels. This paper describes the work on additional devices to reach the ULEV-levels such as: Electrical Heated Catalyst (EHC), Burner Heated Catalyst (BHC), Hydrocarbon Trap (HCT) as external 56</page><page sequence="56">940469-940474 device, and Adsorber Coated Substrate (ACS) in the usual converter box. The comparison of these systems was done with a concept car. The low mileage exhaust results demonstrated the principal suit- ability of all these devices, but there is still much work to be done to meet the ULEV levels with the guaranteed durability. The advan- tages and disadvantages of the systems are discussed, including esti- mated weight and cost. 940470.

Apart from the reduction of engine-out emissions from the powerplant, the development of an efficient and reliable catalytic converter heating system is an important task of automotive engi- neering in the future to meet standards that will require reduction of cold start emissions. Carrying out a comprehensive study in this field, BMW has tested and evaluated possible solutions to this chal- lenge. In addition to the electrically heated catalytic converter (E- cat) and the afterburner chamber, an incorporated burner system would meet the requirement for fast catalyst light-off in the future, particu- larly in the case of larger engines. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940471. Cost effectiveness of the California low emission vehicle standards. Thomas C. Austin and James M. Lyons, Sierra Research, Inc. The "low emission vehicle" (LEV) standards adopted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) require that large-volume manufacturers begin selling electric vehicles in 1998 and that over 99% control of hydrocarbon exhaust emissions be achieved on most other vehicles. When the LEV standards were adopted, the CARB staff estimated that prices for gasoline-fueled cars would increase by $70-170 per vehicle. The price premium for electric cars was estimated to be $1,350. However, a review of detailed information supplied by automobile manufacturers and vendors of emissions control equipment indicates that the actual cost of meeting the LEV standards will be much higher. Based on the least expensive systems currently under develop- ment by vehicle manufacturers, and assuming costs decline by 5% per year, the average price associated with meeting the LEV stan- dards will be about $1,000 higher than vehicles certified to the 1993 federal standards, not including the effect of the 10% electric vehicle mandate. If the public will not pay the estimated $21,000 premium for electric vehicles, the price of the average California vehicle could increase by an additional $2,100 to subsidize the sales of elec- tric vehicles. The increase in average vehicle prices necessary to off- set the price premium for electric vehicles is projected to suppress new vehicle sales, causing hydrocarbon emissions to be higher than without the electric vehicle mandate. If other states require Califor- nia-certified cars, price increases would be somewhat lower due to economies of scale. Assuming nationwide adoption of the LEV standards, the price increase over 1993 models for gasoline- fueled vehicles is projected to be $775 and the price premium for electric vehicles is estimated at $12,600. With a 10% electric vehicle sales mandate, the price of the average new vehicle would be expected to increase by approximately $2,000. Except for the electric vehicle mandate, the LEV standards might be economically justified in California because of that state's more serious air pollution problems. Outside of California, the LEV stan- dards are projected to result in a cost to society that exceeds the eco- nomic benefits by more than a factor of ten. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940472. (SP- 1044) Secondary air injection with a new devel- oped electrical blower for reduced exhaust emissions. Karl Koll- mann, Jörg Abthoff, and Wolfgang Zahn, Mercedes-Benz AG; and Hubert Bischof, and Jochen Göhre, Robert Bosch GmbH. Secondary air injection after cold start gives two effects for reduced exhaust emissions: an exothermic reaction at the hot exhaust valves occurs, which increases the temperature of the exhaust gas and it gives sufficient air to the catalyst during the cold start fuel enrichment that is necessary to prevent driveability prob- lems. Handicaps for the wide use of air injection include space con- straints, weight and price. An electrical air blower was chosen to best satisfy all these requirement. The development steps are described. The result is a three stage radial blower with extremely high revolutions of about 18,000 rpm. The system configuration and the outcome are demonstrated on the new C-Class of Mercedes-Benz. The results show emission reductions higher than 50%, while also satisfying the development goals of noise, volume, weight and cost requirements. 940473. (SP- 1044) Evaluation of specialized methane cata- lytic converters on a CNG-fueled vehicle. Karl H. Hellman, Greg- ory K. Piotrowski, and Ronald M. Schaefer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The current U.S. highway vehicle fleet is almost totally depen- dent on petroleum-based (i.e., gasoline and diesel) fuels. Alterna- tives to petroleum-based fuels may become increasingly important in future years because of their potential contribution to a solution for air quality problems as well as a means to lessen the demand for imported oil in the U.S. One candidate for serious consideration as an alternative motor vehicle fuel is compressed natural gas (CNG). CNG is composed primarily of methane (CH4), but it may contain up to 10 percent higher weight hydrocarbons (mostly ethane, propane and butane). Ozone-forming photochemically reactive fuel-related emissions from CNG vehicles consist primarily of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC). HC emissions from CNG-fueled vehicles are 90-95 per- cent methane, a relatively non-reactive hydrocarbon (HC) species. Gasoline vehicle exhaust HC consists of 65-95 percent more reac- tive non-methane hydrocarbon species, however. It is estimated that CNG-fueled vehicles may have 36-93 percent lower volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, determined on a reactivity-equivalent basis, than gasoline-fueled vehicles (depending on the configuration of the CNG vehicles as either dual-fuel or optimized for CNG). The large methane fraction of the HC exhaust emissions from CNG-fueled vehicles is a problem for engine designers, because methane is the most difficult HC to oxidize catalytically. Some vehi- cle emission tests conducted at General Motors Research Laborato- ries showed that poor methane conversion on lean calibrated CNG- fueled vehicles occurred over the FTP cycle when commercial three-way catalysts were used. Recently further General Motors research indicated good methane conversion occurred when a palla- dium/alumina catalyst was used together with slightly rich feed- stream conditions. Other catalyst development work to date suggests that with proper engine controls, selected catalyst formulations can effectively control methane emissions from CNG-fueled vehicles. EPA' s Technology Development Group routinely conducts and publishes the results from emission control technology evaluations to spur further interest in new technologies. Recently three catalyst companies furnished EPA with samples of fresh, unaged catalysts specifically formulated for use on CNG- fueled vehicles. Thee cata- lysts were evaluated on a CNG-fueled pickup truck at the EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory. The results from this evaluation are presented in this report. 940474.

Polat Öser and Eckart Müller, Volkswagen AG; and Günter Härtel and Armin O. Schürfeld, Pier- burg GmbH. Intensive research and development activities which have been carried out by automotive manufacturers and suppliers of the auto- motive industry are currently focused on new solutions to meet the 57</page><page sequence="57">940474-940479 strict exhaust gas emission standards defined by LEV, ULEV and EG III. While both CO and HC emissions have been curtailed fur- ther and require novel emission technologies, the latter takes on a higher priority due to drastic reduction imposed by ULEV regula- tions. In current emission control systems with three-way catalysts, the major part of these emissions is created during cold start and warm-up phases when the catalyst temperature is below its light-off temperature. The present paper reports on burner/catalyst systems for improv- ing the catalyst's cold start performance, which is a novel technol- ogy compared to other known technologies such as electrically heated catalysts (EHC) and adsorbers. The burner system heats up the catalyst rapidly to its light-off temperature and reduces the cold start emissions without a noticeable fuel penalty. The present paper describes the current state of development of this burner/catalyst system. It provides conversion data obtained from vehicles of Volk- swagen Group and suggests additional improvements to reduce cold start emissions further. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940475. Flow and combustion in a four-valve, spark-ignition optical engine. C. Arcoitmanis, C. S. Bae, and Z. Hu, Imperial Col- lege of Science, Technology and Medicine. The in-cylinder flow during induction and compression in the pentroof chamber of a four-valve, single-cylinder, spark-ignition optical engine was quantified by LDV and correlated with combus- tion development especially under lean mixture conditions. The tumble-generating capacity of the cylinder head was first character- ized by a tumble adaptor under steady flow conditions and, subse- quently, enhanced by two sleeves introduced into the intake ports which generated a stronger tumbling motion. LDV measurements of the in-cylinder flow confirmed the correlation between the stronger tumble during induction and the higher convective velocity and turbulence levels near the spark gap at the time of ignition, which resulted in faster combustion rates and more stable combus- tion under lean mixture conditions. Combustion development was monitored by a pressure transducer and the flame propagation was visualized by an UV intensified CCD camera which allowed com- parison to be made of the initial flame images generated by the sleeved and non-sleeved prot configurations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940476. Investigation of flame speed models for the flame growth period during premixed engine combustion. K. Boulouchos, T. Steiner, and P. Dimopoulos, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The premixed flame growth period of about 1% of the cylinder mass burned has been theoretically investigated under typical homo- geneous charge engine conditions. For this purpose various flame kernel development models have been tested against measured val- ues of flame radius versus time after ignition in a research engine. The flame kernel growth has been computed on the basis of a zero- dimensional model incorporating spark-induced energy, heat loss to the electrodes and flame curvature effects. Subsequently the transi- tion phase from laminar to fully turbulent flame propagation is shown to depend strongly on the relationship between the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum and characteristic scales of the flame. We thereby make use of recently reported results of fundamental experi- ments on vortex-flamelet interaction, that yield typical vortex sizes for flame wrinkling and quenching. Predictions based on this model are in good agreement with measured flame radii over a wide range of engine speeds and equivalence ratios. Moreover, in comparison to simpler flame speed models for steady flame propagation, the spectral approach contributes to a better understanding of the involved processes during flame growth in SI engine combustion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940477. Planar measurements of OH radicals in an S.I. engine based on laser induced fluorescence. Tatsuya Tanaka and Michihiko Tabata, Mazda Motor Corp. The planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique was applied to two dimensional visualization of OH radicals in a com- bustion flame. A frequency doubled Nd:Yag laser pumped dye laser was used to form a laser light sheet which excited the OH X ü-A2! transition. A fluorescence image of the OH radical and a visible image of a combustion flame were simultaneously imaged by a pair of CCD cameras with image intensifiers. Measurement of the OH radical in the combustion flame could be carried out by using this PLIF technique without Mie scattering lights from soot particles and other optical disturbances. The PLIF technique was employed to study the OH radical in the combustion chamber of a spark ignition (S.I.) engine using gasoline as fuel. Measurements of the OH radical fluorescence were carried out under various operating conditions of mass burned fraction, swirl ratio and air-fuel ratio. Images of the OH radical fluorescence were very complicated in structure compared with visible images of the combustion flame in the engine. The fluorescence distribution of the OH radical was not only observed in the near-flame front but also in the post flame gases. The fluorescence intensity of the OH radical increased with the progress of the combustion. The OH radi- cal fluorescence intensity reached a peak value and the concentra- tion of HC emissions in the exhaust gases indicated a minimum value at the optimum swirl ratio. Both the OH radical fluorescence intensity and the concentration of NOx emissions in the exhaust gases reached a peak value at the near-stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940478. The effects of octane enhancing ethers on the reactiv- ity of a primary reference fuel blend in a motored engine. Houliang Li, Srinivasa K. Prabhu, David L. Miller, and Nicholas P. Cernansky, Drexel Univ. This paper presents results of studies investigating the effect of octane enhancing ethers on the reactivity of an 87 octane mixture of primary reference fuels, 87 PRF, in a motored engine. 87 PRF was blended with small percentages of MTBE, ETBE, TAME and DIPE based on a constant gravimetric oxygen percentage in the fuel. The experiments were conducted in a modified single-cylinder Wis- consin AENL engine at compression ratios of 5.2 and 8.2. Super- charging and heating of the intake charge were used to control reac- tivity. The inlet gas temperature was increased from 320K, where no reactivity occurred, until either autoignition occurred or the maxi- mum temperature of the facility was reached. Exhaust carbon mon- oxide levels and in-cylinder pressure histories were monitored in order to determine and quantify reactivity. A fast-acting sampling valve and GC analysis of the extracted samples were used to obtain the concentration profiles of in-cylinder stable species as a function of crank angle degree. Results indicated that while each ether reduced the overall levels of CO formation and increased the inlet temperature at which autoignition occurred, the magnitude of the effect varied. The underlying chemical mechanism for inhibition of autoignition is discussed based on species analysis using 87 PRF, 87 PRF/MTBE, and 87 PRF/DIPE mixtures. The difference in the behaviors of these ethers is discussed in terms of the molecular structure and oxidation chemistry. 940479. Can the maximization of fuel economy be compatible with the minimization of pollutant emissions? A. K. Oppenheim and J. A. Maxson, University of California; and S. M. Shahed, Southwest Research Institute. The mandate of the President's Clean Car Initiative to produce a car engine that will more than double the mileage per gallon of fuel and simultaneously eliminate pollutant emissions poses an unprecedented challenge to automotive industry. It ought to be met, it is claimed, by radical improvements in the execution of the exo- thermic process of combustion. The conventional combustion pro- cess involves the mode of flame traversing the charge (FTC). In this process control over the exothermic process is, in effect, non- existent. The exothermic process should be executed instead by a microprocessor controlled fireball mode of combustion (FMC) - the epitome of direct injection stratified charge (DISC) engine, featur- 58</page><page sequence="58">940479-940485 ing late injection and stratified combustion using a pulsed combus- tion jet (PJC) system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940480. Effect of engine operating variables and piston and ring parameters on crevice hydrocarbon emissions. Neil D. Thompson and James S. Wallace, University of Toronto. A study was performed to determine the effects of engine operat- ing variables and piston and ring parameters on the crevice hydro- carbon emissions from a spark-ignition engine. Natural gas was used as the test fuel in an effort to isolate crevice mechanisms as the only major source of unburned hydrocarbons in the test engine's exhaust. The largest of the in-cylinder crevices, the piston ring pack crevices, were modified, both in size and accessibility, by altering the piston top land height and the number of piston rings and their end gaps. Each piston and ring configuration was subjected to a series of test sweeps of engine operating variables known to affect exhaust hydrocarbon emissions. None of the physical crevice modifications had any significant effect on the level of the exhaust hydrocarbon emissions, although the cycle-to-cycle repeatability of these emissions, measured with a fast hydrocarbon analyzer, was found to vary between the different configurations. Exhaust hydrocarbon concentrations were mini- mized by engine operation at leaner than stoichiometric fuel/air equivalence ratios and, at a fixed ratio, by choosing engine operating parameters which maximized exhaust temperature. A linear correlation between the exhaust hydrocarbon and oxy- gen concentrations was found at a stoichiometric fuel/air equiva- lence ratio. Crevice storage and release of unburned fuel/air mixture was thought to be the reason for this interrelationship. A correlation was derived between the exhaust hydrocarbon con- centration and the exhaust temperature and engine speed which pro- vided an excellent fit to the experimental data. It was concluded that, for an engine fuelled with natural gas, at a fixed fuel/air equivalence ratio, exhaust hydrocarbon levels are primarily determined by the degree of post-combustion oxidation as dictated by the post- combustion in-cylinder temperatures and residence times. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940481. Reduction of HC emission from VTEC engine during cold-start condition. Yukio Nakayama, Takeshi Maruya, Toshihiro Oikawa, and Mikio Fujiwara, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Masashi Kawamata, Honda R&amp;D North America, Inc. In the cities of the U.S., the worsening ozone problem has attracted attention and prompted reinforcement of regulations against emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) from automobiles. To cope with this situation, a reduction of HC is a vital challenge for the automotive industry. HC emission comes mainly from a cold engine, which usually uses a richer air-fuel mixture to achieve stable combustion and secure good driveability. The purpose of this paper is to show that using an engine with a variable valve timing and lift system (VTEC) it is possible to reduce considerably HC emission in cold-start conditions. In other words, it is able to employ a leaner mixture than in existing engines (A/F=15.5) by using the VTEC system to alter the valve timing and lift according to various driving conditions, thereby considerably reducing HC emissions due to the improvement and stabilization of engine combustion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940482. Improving the NOx/fuel economy trade-off for gaso- line engines with the CCVS combustion system. J. Stokes, T. H. Lake, and M. J. Christie, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd.; and I. Denbratt, Volvo Car Corp. A system for stratifying recycled exhaust gas (EGR) in order to substantially increase dilution tolerance has been applied to a single cylinder manifold injected pent-roof four-valve gasoline engine. This system has been given the generic name Combustion Control by Vortex Stratification (CCVS). Preliminary research has shown that greatly improved fuel consumption is achievable at stoichio- metric conditions compared to a conventional version of the same engine whilst retaining ULEV NOx levels. Simultaneously the com- bustion system has shown inherently low HC emissions compared to homogeneous EGR engines. A production viable variable air motion system has also been assessed which increases the effective- ness of the stratification whilst allowing full load refinement and retaining high performance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940483. Preliminary investigation of solenoid activated in- cylinder injection in stoichiometric S.I. engines. T. H. Lake, M. J. Christie, and J. Stokes, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd.; and O. Horada, and K. Shimotani, Isuzu Motors Ltd. An investigation into the application of electronically controlled solenoid activated high pressure in-cylinder gasoline injection sys- tems has been carried out in both conventional and novel four- valve four-stroke pent-roof chamber single-cylinder engines. Air motion requirements were studied and their effects on port design and lay- out were assessed. Alternative injector types, locations and spray characteristics were investigated. Transient and steady-state com- parisons of the engines were made under both normal and cold run- ning conditions. The outlook for the use of in-cylinder injection technology compatible with ULEV emissions requirements is dis- cussed in the light of the results obtained. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940484. A computer model for the assessment of engine con- trol system parameters. Jorge J. G. Martins, Universidade do Minho ; and Denis J. Boam and John F. Bingham, National Engi- neering Laboratory. A computer model has been developed to investigate ways of improving the control of the mixture strength supplied to a spark ignition engine during transients and steady-state operation. The model comprises four sub-models, which calculate the gas dynam- ics, the response of the sensors, the fuelling logic (mass flow and speed-density) and the air-fuel ratio of the running engine. Comparisons are made between different fuelling logics and sen- sor responses for various transient modes (fast and slow accelera- tions) and for a range of engine operating conditions. 940485. (SP- 1039) Performance evaluation of electric dyna- mometers. Carl M. Paulina and John F. Schwarz, U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency has recently purchased electric dynamometers for use in emission and fuel economy testing of light duty vehicles. These dynamometers are equipped with a sin- gle large diameter roll (1.219 meter, 48 inch) and electric inertia/ road load simulation capability. The dynamometers are required to pass a series of robust performance requirements. The evaluation of the system performance was based on data acquisition and analysis completely independent of the dynamometer's operational and anal- ysis software. An independent test system was used for verification of the dynamometer's operational features, control and error report- ing software. Testing was performed following the dynamometer installation at the EPA National Vehicle Fuel and Emission Labora- tory (NVFEL). EPA performed evaluation tests, analyzed the data, and graphically displayed the results using commercially available microcomputer hardware and programs. EPA designed the test data acquisition system and assembled the components. The data acquisition system specifications, final com- ponent build-up documentation, overall capabilities, and various methods of numerical or statistical analysis are presented. The testing program consisted of accelerations, coastdowns, steady speeds, and the Federal Test Procedure Bag 1 driving sched- ules. The simulation settings for two different load curves were used on inertia weight settings which range from 907 kilograms to 2495 kilograms (2000 pounds to 5500 pounds). The tests were performed with and without a vehicle. The parameters which were monitored included time, dynamometer speed, acceleration rates, load cell out- put, dynamometer control demand signal, vehicle wheel speed, 59</page><page sequence="59">940485-940493 vehicle wheel torque, and motor amperage. The data was sampled at 20 and 500 hertz rates with 16-bit resolution. The criteria exam- ined consisted of accuracy, repeatability, and response require- ments. This program objectively quantifies the dynamometer perfor- mance characteristics in these tests. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940486. (SP- 1039) Simulation of 8.65" uncoupled twin-roll hydrokinetic dynamometer operation on a 48" single-roll elec- tric dynamometer. Charles L. Brownell and Curtis Brownell, Horiba Instruments, Inc.; Severino D'Angelo, Real Time Instru- ments, Inc.; Todd M. Fagerman, Ford Motor Co.; and William G. Mears, Dynamotive Engineering, Inc. Vehicle operation on 8.65" uncoupled twin-roll hydrokinetic and 48" single-roll dynamometers were analyzed for speed, road load, and inertia simulation differences. Tire slip measurements were used to determine generic coefficients accounting for differences on the two dynamometers. Control methods were developed to use operational speed and load measurements on the 48" dynamometer to predict the instantaneous rear roll speed which would have occurred on the twin rolls, and to compute instantaneous load cor- rections on the 48" dynamometer to simulate the twin-roll dyna- mometer. Emission and fuel economy tests were run to evaluate simulation effectiveness. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940487. (SP- 1039) High accuracy high response 48 inch roll chassis dynamometer. Yorikatsu Suzuki, Ken Torikai, Hisashi Ichiriki, Toshimitsu Maruki, and Akira Yamamoto, Meidensha Corp. The development is completed of a new 48" roll chassis dyna- mometer for 2 wheel drive (2WD) and 4 wheel drive (4WD) light duty vehicle (LDV). Overhung roll configuration onto the shaft of a hydraulic frame floated AC dynamometer is applied. Braking force measurement accuracy of PAU is ±0.1% of full scale. Vehicle traction force can be measured in high response manner without wheel torquemeter. The above and some new instrumentation archi- tecture are reported. Digital vector controller for PAU and a new digital road load controller enabled 90% step response in 75 ms. Besides that, a dynamic road load verification method and 4WD application is reported. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940488.

Given the legal requirements for quality assurance of passenger car exhaust emissions worldwide we define our quality assurance system and present the emission laboratories of the Mercedes-Benz assembly plants Sindelfingen and Bremen. We developed a hierar- chically structured, multi-level computer system, which enables us to automize emission test procedures, calibration, maintenance of measurement systems and documentation of exhaust data. Test cell computers coordinate the different components of the test cells and perform maintenance and calibration of measurement devices, thus guaranteeing a high measurement quality with reason- able economy. The coordinating level computer, the emission host system (EHS), processes test parameters, controls and supervises the test sequences and evaluates the test results on a statistical basis. This ensures that all legally required test sequences worldwide are adhered to and allows us to recognize changes in exhaust emission quality and thus react to any changes quickly. The test results are stored in a data-documentation-system, where data cannot be deleted or changed without leaving traces and all pre- vious data being shown. This data is evaluated in many ways by Research &amp; Development, Mercedes-Benz Headquarters and Pro- duction thus forming a basis of quality control loops for further exhaust emission improvements. All in all, with this integrated computer system we achieve highly reliable measurements and high conformity to legal require- ments while reasonable economy is also ensured. 940490.

(SP- 1039) A strategy to demonstrate the compliance of automotive controller software to systems requirements using simulation technology. Kenneth R. Butler and John R. Wagner, Delco Electronics Corp. Real time embedded automotive control systems permit vehicles to operate within established emissions, safety, and passenger com- fort guidelines. The increasing size, functionality, and complexity of controller software requires the development of rigorous verifica- tion methodologies to demonstrate compliance with software and systems requirements. To anticipate the needs of vehicle manufac- turers, Delco Electronics is reviewing their internal software verifi- cation process. In this paper, one strategy for the methodological testing of automotive controller software is presented and demon- strated. To initiate the testing process, systems requirements are reviewed and used to create test plans and procedures. These materi- als, cross-referenced to the software and systems requirements, out- line the type of tests to be performed, the test procedures, and the expected results. Automotive controller tests may then be executed on static or dynamic vehicle simulators, which supply an electronic environment similar to the actual vehicle. The real time hardware - in-the-loop simulation facility provides a dynamic and repeatable test environment with integrated data acquisition. To facilitate test- ing, several strategies have been formulated which permit the direct control of controller and/or driver inputs during a test. An example test plan and set of procedures will be developed for two linear exhaust gas recirculation valve systems requirements. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940493.

Gunness, MTS Systems Corp. 60</page><page sequence="60">940493-940500 Components often experience multi-axial loads in service. How- ever, it is a common practice to test components with uniaxial applied loads. Uniaxial lab tests are valid when the principal angle of the measured data remains constant. If not, the lab failure modes may be different than failure modes in service. Historically, cycle based editing has offered great testing efficiency but has only been available for uniaxial data. This paper outlines a method of cycle based editing which reproduces the multi-axial fatigue mechanism on fixed reaction test rigs. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940494.

A high efficiency mechanically assembled aluminum radiator with real flat tubes. Maurizio Parrino, Andrea Parola, and Luigi Dentis, Magneti Marelli S. p. A. The use of oval flat tubs in the Mechanically Assembled Radia- tors (MAR) has extended the application field of this technology, covering wide range of brazed radiator applications. This second generation of Mechanical Radiators is characterized by oval tubes with a/b ratio greater than 3.0, which allows to approach to the brazed radiator tube shape. To approach to the flat tube geometry a new mechanically assembled aluminum radiator with real flat tubes has been devel- oped and realized. The purpose of this paper is to present the development results of a radiator with real flat tubes of mechanical assembled type, named SIRIO, the effect of flat shape on the performances and com- parison with relevant oval flat tubes. 940496. A heat transfer study of a copper/brass automotive heat exchanger. Steven Worley, Chrysler, Corp. Early in the design process of a copper/brass automotive heat exchanger, such as a radiator or heater core it is desirable to deter- mine the heat transfer performance of the proposed design. Straight forward computer aided design can be used in the form of a BASIC computer program that can be run on a personal com- puter. By developing such a program an insight can be gained into the mechanisms at work within the heat exchanger core. This paper is a mathematical heat transfer study of a typical cop- per/brass automotive heat exchanger. The heat transfer mechamisms which are involved in this crossflow type heat exchanger are broken down into their discreet paths. The paths to be studied are the cool- ant to the tube convective heat transfer, the fin to tube interface, and the fin to air convective heat transfer. From this study an under- standing of the critical design features are identified, which is essen- tial for diagnosing which features are responsible for causing a sig- nificant reduction of heat exchanger performance especially during production where heat transfer is monitored on a regular basis and a quick and accurate diagnosis is required to correct heat transfer performance. From this analysis, an algorithm will be developed for calculating the heat transfer for a given geometry. 940497. Corrosion mechanism of high lead solder and corre- lation to dissolved oxygen. David L. Miller, Renee T. Bade, and John E. Orth, Texaco, Inc. High lead solder coupons are frequently tested in ASTM D 1384- 87 and D 2570-91 tests to determine the corrosion protection pro- vided by engine coolants. In contrast to 70/30 solder, high lead sol- der is often observed to show relatively high corrosion rates in D 1384-87 testing. Surprisingly, the high lead solder corrosion rates tend to be lower in the D 2570-91 test, despite the long duration of this test. The basis of this effect has been investigated in different coolant formulating and in both ethylene glycol land propylene glycol. The corrosion of high lead solder was found to be directly related to the presence of oxygen in the D 1384-87 test. Replacement of the air purge with a nitrogen purge significantly reduced the corrosion rate of high lead solder in inhibited coolants. These results are inter- preted in terms of the solder composition. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940498. The effect of silicate content in engine coolants on the corrosion protection of aluminum heat-rejecting surfaces. Paul Van de Ven and Jean-Pierre Maes, Texaco Research &amp; Develop- ment. The effect of small amounts of silicate on coolant performance has been studied. The corrosion protection provided by different coolant technologies was evaluated for different silicate contents. This work includes results from electrochemical tests and static and dynamic heat-rejecting tests on aluminum surfaces. The results indicate that small amounts of silicate have a negative effect on the corrosion protection of aluminum. Depletion of sili- cates can therefore be expected to affect aluminum heat-rejecting surfaces. The use of carboxylic acid corrosion inhibitors can over- come this problem. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940499. Development of an understanding of the critical fac- tors influencing waterside corrosion behavior of brazed alumi- num radiators. Alan Gray and Andrew Howells, Alean Interna- tional Ltd. The application of aluminum alloy materials for automotive heat exchangers, including engine cooling and air conditioning systems, is now widespread. To meet the industry demands of both extended service life and improved reliability for heat exchanger components, it is important that the critical factors influencing corrosion behavior are properly understood, particularly with the trend towards down- gauging of materials. To maximize resistance to waterside corrosion, manufacturers have adopted the approach of using an internal cladding, commonly a high purity or zinc-containing alloy, to provide sacrificial protec- tion of the core material. Recent studies have shown that the presence of an internal clad- ding can, under certain conditions, promote rapid localized attach of the core alloy. This paper will discuss the implication of these results to in- service performance of radiator units and describe the development of a rapid screening test for evaluating the performance of different core/cladding systems. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940500. Long life performance of carboxylic acid based cool- ants. Debra A. Washington and David L. Miller, Texaco Chemical Co.; Jean-Pierre Maes and Paul Van de Ven, Texaco Research and Development; and John E. Orth, Texaco Chemical Co. An inhibitor package which is silicate-, nitrate-, borate- and phosphate-free has been developed as the basis for a world-wide automotive coolant formulation. The formulation contains aliphatic mono-and dicarboxylic acids and tolyltriazole as the sole inhibitors. Formulations containing carboxylic acid inhibitors have been stud- ied in ASTM bench tests and found to sufficiently protect all preva- lent cooling system metals. In addition, fleet tests have shown that carboxylic acid inhibitors deplete much more slowly than conven- tional inhibitors, making possible a much longer life coolant. Results from laboratory tests which simulate extended usage indi- cated that carboxylic acid-containing coolants have a significantly longer life span for the protection of all cooling system metals. 61</page><page sequence="61">940500-940507 Finally, the carboxylic acid/tolyltriazole inhibitor package is com- pletely adaptable to a propylene glycol base. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940501. An analytical prediction of water droplet travel when discharged from the face of an evaporator core. J. Steven Brown, Joseph L. Terry ' and Robert J. Hutter, Ford Motor Co. Here we present an analytical model, written in general terms, which predicts the trajectory of a spherical particle/droplet placed in a uniform fluid stream. The model is compared to an experiment in which three millimeter diameter polypropolyene spheres (specific gravity=0.91) are dropped in a uniform airstream (velocity varies from 0.9 to 3.8 m/s). Agreement between the two suggests the model incorporates all the important physics and thus should be useful as a design tool. 940502. NOCOLOK™ Sil Flux - A novel approach for braz- ing aluminum. A. Baidantoni, B. J. Janeway, D. C. Lauzon, M. J. Purdon, and R. S. Timsit , Alean International Ltd. The need to reduce the weight of automobiles has favored the widespread use of aluminum in automotive ventilation and cooling systems. Space, weight restrictions, the need for increased thermal efficiency, and recycling legislation have all contributed to new designs for heat exchangers. In many cases there has been a move to using extruded tube rather than seam- welded tube, leading to a reliance on the relatively more expensive clad fin. A new process, NOCOLOK™ Sil flux brazing, offers the poten- tial for materials cost savings through the use of "in- situ" filler metal generation. This eliminates the need for using clad brazing materials. It can be applied to a number of alloy systems and product forms. This new technology is firmly rooted in the well established NOCOLOCK™ non-corrosive aluminum brazing flux system. In many applications it can be substituted directly for the conventional non-corrosive flux system, the new process uses the same equip- ment and brazing cycle, while eliminating the use of clad materials. This new technology has been successfully used for brazing automotive heat exchangers. Fin-to-tube joints can be made in a controlled atmosphere furnace using unclad materials, and tube- to- tube joints can be made without brazing wire preform rings using any suitable heat source. The resulting joint quality is equivalent in every respect to that produced using the conventional non-corrosive flux/braze sheet process. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940503. Optical methods aid for visualization of convective heat flow patterns. Scott P. Dudley and Tommy B. Hoover, Ford Motor Co.; and Robert E. Barry, Lawrence Technological Univ. The use of Shadowgraph and Schlieren optical systems is a sim- ple method to determine flow patterns of heated air external to the vehicle at idle. In particular, the method can be used to visualize nat- ural convective air flow patterns at the underbody to aid in heat shielding design. Moreover, air recirculation patterns around the front end of the vehicle can be visualized without the use of smoke. The optical equipment is described and recommendations proposed for setting up the equipment. A video tape of some results is also presented. 940504. Rationally based heat transfer and friction correla- tions for the louver fin geometry. Eric R. Dillen and Ralph L. Webb, Pennsylvania State Univ. The louvered fin geometry is widely used for heat transfer to air in automotive heat exchangers. The only published correlation for heat transfer and friction in the corrugated louver fin geometry is that of Davenport. However, this correlation is strictly empirical, since it is based on a multiple regression correlation using dimen- sional parameters assumed to be important. Further, the correlation does not include the dimensions of the inlet/exit and the internal flow redirection louvers. The objective of the present work is the development of an improved, rationally based correlation. The cor- relation is based on dividing the total fin surface into four different regions, and applying rationally based heat transfer and friction equations to each of these regions. The resulting correlation is semi- analytical, since it is based on heat transfer mechanisms and theoret- ical relationships expected to apply the various regions of the fin. A similar procedure is used for the friction correlation. The heat transfer (and friction) correlations each contain only one empirical constant. The development of the correlation is illustrated using the data on 32 core geometries published by Davenport. The standard deviation of the heat transfer and friction correlations are 7.0% and 9.0%, respectively. In terms of maximum deviations, 97% of the data are predicted within ±20%, with 81% of the data predicted within ±10%. Because the fin geometries tested by Davenport do not contain near-parallel fins, better results are expected using a database of commercially typical louver fin geometries. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940505. Development of a long life aluminum brazing sheet alloy with enhanced mechanical performance. G. J. Marshall, A. J. E. Flemming, and A. Gray, Alean International Ltd.; and R. Lle- wellyn, Alean Rolled Products UK. The use of aluminum alloys for automotive heat exchangers has increased considerably in the last 15-20 years and, in parallel, new alloys have been developed to meet the increased demand for strength and improved corrosion resistance. A non-heat treatable Al-Mn alloy, X800, has been developed by Alean to significantly increase the corrosion resistance of radiator tubes when subjected to typical service environments. The alloy development employed considerable microstructural understanding to provide heat exchanger manufacturers with an improved product that readily attained enhanced performance during any brazing cycle. A similar philosophy has been adopted to address the issue of increased mechanical performance, high intrinsic sheet strength, both during and after brazing, provides the opportunity for sheet downgauging and thus lightweighting of components. These are key requirements in an industry sensitive to the need for fuel economy and sound environmental practices whilst maintaining or improving component performance. It is only by the detailed understanding of those microstructural features that control sheet properties that new alloys can be successfully developed to meet these stringent demands. This paper will discuss the options for enhancing the mechanical performance of brazing sheet and detail the development of a second generation of X800, Alean' s new X900 brazing sheet core alloy. Reference will be made to the control of microstructural features that are important to this new alloy and that create the significantly increased strength without detriment to the long-life corrosion behavior of the parent alloy. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940506. Low odor binder for molded fiberglass. Philip F. Miele, Schuller International. Molded automotive headliners are composed of a matrix of glass fibers and an organic thermosetting binder. Conventional fiberglass binders for applications such as automotive headliners contain nitro- gen based formaldehyde scavenging compounds to reduce the release of highly irritating formaldehyde fumes in the product form- ing and molding steps. The scavenging compounds employed can result in the formation and deposition of objectionable amine com- pounds, specifically trimethylamine, in the finished products. Since the release of highly odorous compounds in a vehicle interior is very undesirable, a new fiberglass binder has been developed for molded products that eliminates the root cause of objectionable odors. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940507. Viability of modified polyphenylene ether foam for headliner applications. Holly Wilson, GE Plastics. Design of experiments results indicate that PPE foam is feasible for use in headliner applications. These results correspond to the current use of thermoplastic foams as headliner substrates in Japan and Europe. 62</page><page sequence="62">940507-940517 Thermoplastic foams offer many benefits for headliner applica- tions. However, one concern has been with heat resistance and envi- ronmental cycling, specifically heat sag performance. To address this concern, a Design of Experiments (DOE) was completed on Polyphenylene Ether foam to understand how PPE content, foam density, thickness, and thermoforming compression effect heat sag performance for headliner applications. The DOE determined that for heat sag performance: %PPe and density strongly effect heat sag, thickness does not effect heat sag, thermoforming compression interacts with PPE content in its effect on heat sag. This paper will focus on the methodology behind the study and indicate optimum foam configuration for heat sag performance in headliner applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940508. Balancing customer driven requirements for high value headliner systems. James P. Shedlowsky and Thomas F. Wentworth, General Motors Corp. This paper outlines a process for a vehicle manufacturer to iden- tify and prioritize requirements for headliners which provide CUS- TOMER VALUE. The process includes those requirements placed on headliners to satisfy the vehicle purchasing customer, as well as the in-process customers involved in the design, development and manufacturing of the vehicle and the headlining assembly. Means of quantifying performance for each requirement are pro- posed. CUSTOMER VALUE can be compared for various headliner alternatives using the definition; VALUE=PERFORMANCE/ COST. A VALUE SELECTION WORKSHEET is presented as the framework for a vehicle manufacturer to select the highest value headliner design and materials for a specific vehicle application. 940510. (SP- 1023) Development of a 24 kW gas turbine- driven generator set for hybrid vehicles. Robin Mackay, NoMac Energy Systems, Inc. A 24 kW, 30% efficient gas turbine-driven generator set is being developed for hybrid electric vehicles. With the generator mounted on the same shaft as the compressor and the turbine, the rotor group is the only moving part other than the fuel pump. There are no engine-driven accessories. There is no oil as the rotor is mounted on air bearings. There is no water or antifreeze as the generator set is air cooled. Orientation can be vertical or horizontal. Emission levels on unleaded gasoline, methanol, M85, ethanol or natural gas are much less than ULEV standards using a lean pre- mix combustor. They are one or two orders of magnitude less than ULEV standards using a catalytic combustor. This paper addresses some of the design and application factors considered in developing the hardware. 940511. Development of design tools for modeling the illumi- nation of automotive displays and instruments. John F. Van Der- lofske, Thomas A. Hough, and Lloyd W. Hillman, University of Ala- bama. We will discuss our cooperative effort between university research and private industry on modeling, testing, and design of optical systems for illuminating automobile dashboard systems. Under this project, we are developing models and algorithms that yield cost-effective and optimized configurations: simple designs that provide uniform illumination using the fewest number of bulbs. This effort reflects how private industry can increase its competi- tiveness using university resources. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940512. Management of light in thick optical waveguides for dashboard illumination: an application of radiometric princi- ples. Thomas A. Hough, John F. Van Derlofske, and Lloyd W. Hill- man, University of Alabama. We are using principles of radiometry and non-imaging optics to model and test flux collection and transportation in thick optical waveguides. Output from these systems is used to illuminate auto- mobile dashboard clusters and radio modules. Starting with the bulb, we determine the input flux distribution. We then demonstrate how the waveguide collects and transports flux down its length. We will discuss ways of controlling and optimizing this process. 940513. High visibility virtual instrumentation. Kunimitsu Aoki, Tadashi lino, and Yoshiyuki Furuya, Yazaki Corp.; and Yasuyuki Watanabe, Yazaki Meter Corp. Virtual instruments for motor vehicles are already used on sev- eral car models to improve visibility and reduce the size of display devices (by utilizing the optical enlargement technique). The merits of a virtual instrument are gradually recognized. The performance of a conventional virtual instrument allows a display distance of approximately 80 mm and an enlargement factor of 1 .3 times. Better results would be obtained if the performance is further improved. The virtual instrument which has been developed by us improves these features to 200 mm and 1.5 times, respectively, by using an optical design which is different from a conventional system. The present paper describes the result of evaluation of visibility, structure and design technique for the new virtual instrument. 940514. High luminance graphic vacuum fluorescent display for automotive applications. Tukasa Minato, Masahiro Torikai, and Kazuyuki Y ano, Futaba Corp.; and Robert Davis, Futaba Cor- poration of America. The Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) is widely accepted as a superior display device because of its self luminance and excellent readability. A reconfigurable graphic VFD consisting of 128 x 32 dots, with high luminance, has been developed. It is suitable as a multi function automotive message display. To realize a high lumi- nance and reliable graphic VFD, the improved phosphor material, mechanical construction and driving condition have been studied. This paper discusses these considerations to achieve high lumi- nance. 940515. Development of a display unit for an automobile nav- igation system. Yukio Kominami and Junichi Kojima, Sumitomo Wiring Systems, Ltd.; and Hiroaki Nobuta, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. This paper describes a display unit for automotive navigation systems. The distinguishing feature of this display unit is the fact that it employs a 5.6 inch TFT-LCD (Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) for on-vehicle use. Compared with a 6- inch CRT, the unit has an expanded effective display area (screen) for improved readability, as well as greater compactness (for saving space), lighter weight, and lower power consumption. In terms of reliability, the display unit outperforms conventional LCDs due to its wider working temperature range and outstanding resistance to thermal shock. In terms of operation, the system employs a combi- nation of infrared touch switches, hard-key switches and a joy stick to ensure safety and ease of operation. The 1994 Model MAZDA "SENTIA" is equipped with this newly developed display unit for an automobile navigation system. 940517. (SP- 1038) Performance of a high speed engine with dual fuel capability. Christopher J. Tennant, Reme o D. de Jong, Richard J. Atkinson, Michael L. Traver, Christopher M. Atkinson, Christopher J. Vincent, Nigel N. Clark, and Donald W. Lyons, West Virginia University. Concern over dwindling oil supplies has led to the adoption of alternate fuels to power fleet vehicles. However, during the interim period when alternate fuel supply stations are few and far between, dual fuel engines prove a necessity. In the light duty arena, these engines are typically gasoline engines modified to accommodate compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternate fuel, but they are sel- dom optimized with both fuels in mind. A Saturn 1.9 liter 4 cylinder 63</page><page sequence="63">940517-940522 dual overhead cam engine was selected as a base for developing an optimized gasoline/CNG powerplant. Baseline data on power and steady state emissions (CO2, CO. NOx, HC) were found using the standard Saturn controller. In addition to monitoring standard sensor measurements, real-time pressure traces were taken for up to 256 cycles using a modified head with embedded PCB piezoelectric pressure transducers. A controller was developed that could mimic original Saturn controller performance yet permit excursions on any control variable in order to map engine response. Effect of spark timing and equivalence ratio on emissions and performance were then assessed using gasoline as a fuel. Classical variation of CO, HC, and NOx with air/fuel ratio variation was observed. Natural gas operation was achieved using four simultaneously firing solenoid operated injectors with a 100 psi feed pressure, situated upstream of the throttle plate. For stoichiometric operation with the speed, torque and location of peak pressure held at the same points as those for gasoline, hydrocarbon emissions were found to be significantly lower and NOx emissions slightly lower than on gasoline operation. Data on effects of varying timing and air/fuel ratio during natural gas operation were also obtained. This study is working toward the goal of recovering power loss usually associated with CNG opera- tion, while avoiding knock during gasoline operation. 940518. (SP- 1038) The Rand-Cam engine: a pistonless four stroke engine. Patrick Badgley, Adiabatics, Inc.; and Gregory Thompson, Nigel N. Clark, Ralf Wohl, Victor H. Miicino, and James E. Smith, West Virginia Univ. The Rand-Cam engine is a positive displacement machine, oper- ating on a four stroke cycle, which consists of a rotor with multiple axial vanes forming combustion chambers as the rotor and vanes rotate in a cam shaped housing. The cam housing, consisting of two "half-housings" or stators, contains a toroidal trough of varying depth machined into each stator. The two stators are phased so that the shallowest point on one trough corresponds to the deepest on the other. A set of six vanes, able to move axially through machined holes in the rotor, traverses the troughs creating six captured zones per side. These zones vary in volume with rotor rotation. Since each trough has two deep sections and two shallow sections with ramps in between, full four stroke operation is obtained between each pair of vanes in each trough, corresponding to twelve power "stokes"; per revolution. Since intake, compression, power and exhaust strokes are separated in space along the trough length, intake and exhaust flow is achieved using ports and opportunities for simple variable port timing exist. Aside from dynamic considerations, trough and vane shape are influenced by thermodynamics and man- ufacturing considerations. The desire for a continuous line contact between the vane seal and trough (cam) throughout a rotation under constraint of a finite vane thickness has led to the construction of a prototype model to demonstrate this concept. Vane motion is then purely cycloidal. The cam profile is also influenced by the need to keep the pressure angle between the vane and bearing surface cam as low as possible, while providing enough dwell near "top-dead- center" to provide adequate compression ratio. Basic design of a prototype, including port and plug placement, are presented and compression ignition design considerations are reviewed. 940519. (SP- 1038) Parametric modeling and analysis of a planetary gear-CVT mechanism. Victor H. Mucino, James E. Smith, Ben Cowan, and Marek Kmicikiewicz, West Virginia Univ. The mechanism considered here, combines the functions of a planetary gear train and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) system, through a circulating power control unit, which results by connecting the sun-gear shaft and the ring-gear rotation through a variable pitch pulley system. The mechanism is simple and does not require clutches for its operation. Three basic configurations are presented, two of them produce a power feedback effect and a third one produces a power split forward, without a "geared neutral" condition. Parametric analysis is carried out in relation to the circu- lating power split feature in order to assist in the design of an opti- mum configuration for light-weight applications. A parametric approach is used to generate a model that can be used to perform parametric sensitivity analysis. In the optimization process, a parametric characterization is made based on the most significant parameters and functional ratios of the system to evaluate the performance of the variable transmission and power control unit. Three different transmission ratios and two independent design parameters fully define the configuration of the system. These are: the planetary gear train ratio the CVT transmission ratio, and the control to output gear ratio. The two independent parameters can be selected from the radii of two groups of elements (one from each), that include: a) the planetary gear carrier, the sun gear, the internal ring gear and b) the control ring gear, and the output gear. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940520. (SP- 1038) Thermal and mechanical properties of mullite-crystallized glass ceramics DPF with pulse-wave corru- gated honeycomb structure. Kenich Nakamura, Kunio Kimura, Atsushi Nishino, Kimimichi Tokuda, and Mineo Aoki, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.; and M akoto Ogawa, and Koichi Watanabe, Kyushu Matsushita Electric Co., Ltd. As one of the high temperature capability Diesel Particulate Fil- ter (DPF), mullite fiber ceramics had developed. It had some merits as high filtration efficiency, low initial back pressure, light weight and so on, but it also had a fatal weak point as lower thermal shock resistance compared with cordielite ceramics. It's derived form its higher thermal expansion coefficient, lower mechanical strength and lower thermal conductivity. Sericite clay used as a ceramic binder mainly effects on the ther- mal properties, and the structure of DPF effects on the mechanical strength. New sericite clay, in which the potassium oxide content is refined, reduces the thermal expansion coefficient compared with the previous clay and the ratio of the sericite clay and ceramics fiber relates to the thermal conductivity of DPF. The structure of DPF is also examined to improve the mechanical strength. In this paper, we will report how these properties are improved, and describe the evaluation of the mullite-crystallized glass ceram- ics DPF. 940521. Simulation of flow field generated by intake port- valve- cylinder configurations - Comparison with measure- ments and applications. Pierre Godrie, Teuchos; and Marc Zellat, Renault S. A. Steady flow simulations have been performed on two typical intake port shapes: a straight port and swirl producing one. The code Star-CD was used with the standard k-e turbulence model. For both ports, detailed comparisons with measurement data have shown good qualitative results for the discharge coefficient and velocity field in the cylinder. For the second port, the swirl coefficient com- putation has been largely improved by a global mesh refinement and a blended higher order discretization scheme. Due to the more com- plex flow structure produced, results for the straight port were found to be less sensitive to those parameters. The discharge coefficient evaluation was also slightly better. As this approach was shown to be efficient, it is now applied industrially. Sensitivity to upstream conditions is shown for particular port shapes. Correlation with the swirl measured by a paddle wheel is discussed. The swirl production mechanisms are described using several tools By analyzing these mechanisms, we improved port shape to reach a requested compromise between the discharge and the swirl coefficients. Engine torque predictions based on computed discharge coeffi- cients correlate properly with test bench results for various cases. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940522. An investigation of steady flow through a curved inlet port. A. Chen and J. C. Dent, Loughborough University of Technology. 64</page><page sequence="64">940522-940527 This paper presents a combined experimental and computational study of steady flow through a curved inlet port. Three- dimensional flow within the port and cylinder for the intake process has been simulated using the CFD code STAR-CD. Flow structures affected by the valve lift and port shape were predicted. Local static surface pressure was measured on a twice full size model of the port, valve and cylinder assembly. The static pressure maps from both measure- ment and computation provide detailed information on the intake port flow. The numerical predictions show an appreciable pressure recovery for a favorable flow passage between the valve seat and the valve head, which confirm earlier port design procedures. An optimum valve size for the present curved port was explored. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940523. Modeling the effects of fuel injection characteristics on diesel engine soot and NOx emissions. M. A. Patterson , S.-C. Kong, G. J. Hampson, and R. D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin. The three-dimensional KIVA code has been used to study the effects of injection pressure and split injections on diesel engine per- formance and soot and NOx emissions. The code has been updated with state-of-the-art submodels including: a wave breakup atomiza- tion model, drop drag with drop distortion, spray/wall interaction with sliding, rebounding, and breaking-up drops, multi-step kinetics ignition and laminar-turbulent characteristic time combustion, wall heat transfer with unsteadiness and compressibility, Zeldovich NOx formation, and soot formation with Nagle Strickland-Constable oxi- dation. The computational results are compared with experimental data for a single-cylinder Caterpillar research engine equipped with a high- pressure, electronically-controlled fuel injection system, a full-dilution tunnel for soot measurements, and gaseous emissions instrumentation. The results show the use of the updated version of KIVA gives good agreement between measured and predicted engine cylinder pressures and heat release data for single injection cases. This level of agreement was found to be necessary so that the predicted and measured soot and NOx emissions trends would also agree well. Soot and NOx emissions were also found to be very sen- sitive to factors that influence the chamber gas temperatures such as crevice flow. The results show that the combustion is controlled by the details of the spray model. In particular, drop breakup and drop drag effects govern the penetration and mixing of vaporizing sprays under diesel engine conditions. The effects of spray-wall impingement were also found to be important. Consistent with mea- sured data, computations showed that soot and NOx emissions increase at low injection pressures. Predictions made with ultra-high injection pressures suggest that there is a limit to the usefulness of high injection pressures for NOx emissions reduction. Good agree- ment with measured data was also found for split injections with rel- atively short dwells between injections. For split injections with larger dwell, the agreement deteriorated, indicating that refinements in spray, ignition and combustion models are still needed. Consis- tent with experiments, the computations show that split injections have a significant effect on the overall rate of pressure rise. The good agreement between experiments and model predictions indi- cates that computer models are now available for use by the engine industry to provide directions for engine design and to gain insight into in-cylinder events. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940524. The simulation of autoignition and knock in a spark ignition engine with disk geometry. C. A. Blunsdon and J. C. Dent, Loughborough University of Technology. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code KIVA has been modified to include a combustion model and the Shell autoignition mechanism, and has been applied to a disk-chambered homoge- neous charge spark ignition engine. The effects of ignition timing, turbulent kinetic energy and EGR were investigated for offset igni- tion. The effects of swirl and central ignition were separately inves- tigated. For the central ignition case the influence of asymmetry of piston and cylinder head surface temperatures was also considered. The results of the computational study are in general agreement with experimentally observed trends regarding heat release rate and phasing and their influence on cylinder pressure development, autoignition and knock. With the CFD code it was possible to observe, following autoignition, large amplitude pressure waves and acoustic resonant modes in the combustion chamber, which are gen- erally in agreement with the published literature. This aspect of the present study merits further attention in relation to combustion noise and engine roughness. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940525. Modeling fuel spray impingement on a hot wall for gasoline engines. Makoto Nagaoka, Hiromitsu Kawazoe, and Naomi Nomura, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc. A new spray/wall impingement model for gasoline engines has been developed. The model is based on experimental analysis of impinging spray droplets using a phase doppler particle analyzer (PDPA). Three new equations were obtained in terms of droplet size, Weber number and the angle from a wall for droplets which were splashed after impinging or created by the impact of a droplet on the liquid film layer on the wall. The three- dimensional calcula- tion results using the model agree very well with the experimental data. The model is also applied to the fuel mixture formation process in a lean-burn gasoline engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940526. Numerical prediction of fuel secondary atomization behavior in SI engine based on the oval-parabola trajectories (OPT) model. Ken Naitoh, Yasuo Takagi, and Hiroko Kokita, Nis- san Motor Co., Ltd.; and Kunio Kuwahara, Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. A theoretical model based on a nonlinear ordinary differential equation was developed, which can estimate the atomization process of fuel droplets after the wall impingement. The phase- space trajec- tory of the equation for droplet deformation and oscillation varies from oval to parabola with increasing impact velocity. Four differ- ent regimes for droplet diameter distribution are derived from this complex feature of the equation. The amount of liquid film remain- ing on the wall and the number of droplets are estimated from the related mass and energy conservation laws. The model is called the oval-parabola trajectories (OPT) model in the present report. Comparisons made with some fundamental experimental data confirm that this mathematical model is effective in a velocity range from 2m/s to 40m/s and in a diameter range below 300 micrometers. A previously reported numerical code based on the multi-level formulation and the renormalization group theory is combined with the OPT model and the TAB model. The visualization reemerged by computations indicate that secondary atomization behavior on valve surfaces plays a significant role in the fuel mixture formation in the cylinder of spark-ignition engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940527. Vehicle occupant position sensing. David S. Breed, Wilbur DuVall, and Vittorio Castelli, Automotive Technologies International, Inc. Regardless of whether crash sensors are mounted in the crush zone or non-crush zone, there will always be crashes where the sen- sors trigger late and the occupant has moved to a position near to the airbag deployment cover where he or she may be injured by the deployment of the airbag. The required sensor triggering time is now determined by assuming that the occupant is a 50% male sitting in the mid seating position. 70% of vehicle occupants are smaller and, on average, sit closer to the airbag and thus are even more likely to be out-of-position. Finally, current sensor systems make no allowance for occupants that are wearing seatbelts, for rear facing child seats located on the front passenger seat or for unoccupied seats. There are thus strong safety reasons for occupant position sen- sors. 65</page><page sequence="65">940527-940536 This paper discusses the above problems, the difficulties in sens- ing occupants and objects located in the vehicle and attempts to define the requirements for such devices. It also presents some of the added benefits which will result from effective sensors which can characterize the contents of the vehicle such as heating, air con- ditioning and entertainment systems which adjust to vehicle occu- pants. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940528. (SP- 1045) An overview of emergency locking retrac- tor performances of shoulder harness safety belt systems in American made vehicles. Prasenjit Adhikari and David A. Ren- froe, Renfroe Engineering , Inc. With the advent of the Emergency Locking Retractors (ELRs) in the seventies, the mechanism of the seat belt safety system started becoming increasingly complex. The ELRs were made either web- bing sensitive or vehicle sensitive. The former type contained an inertial device that activated after sensing webbing acceleration. The latter contained an inertia responsive pendulum mass and had the ability to lock-up whenever the vehicle experienced a sudden change in velocity or a sudden tilt or rotation. In this paper, the ELR mechanisms that employ the pendulum- pawl system are discussed and their susceptibility to fail under cer- tain conditions investigated. The present research was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the ELR mechanisms and identify those conditions where the ELR was least effective. The scope of this study constituted of development of a mathematical model to predict and simulate the kinematics and dynamics of the system and also conducting bench-scale seat belt tests under varying conditions. In order to observe the operation of the retractor mechanism under test conditions, an exemplar seat belt assembly was mounted on a specially fabricated movable carriage. The effect of a stationary barrier crash was simulated by providing a positive acceleration on the carriage. Acceleration data were recorded using a computerized data acquisition system. The entire test procedure was recorded using a high-speed (1000-4000 frames/sec) motion analysis system and analyzed later in more detail. 940531. (SP- 1045) Smart seat belts - Some population con- siderations applied to intelligent restraint systems. Murray Mackay, Birmingham Accident Research Center. Throughout the motorized world seat belts are now accepted and worn by the majority of front seat occupants and by an increasing proportion of rear seat passengers, and data is presented to illustrate current rates. Current seat belts and airbags have fixed characteris- tics, usually optimized around the 30 mph flat barrier test for airbags with an otherwise unrestrained 50th percentile male dummy, and in the case of the restrained dummy the restraints are optimized to the 35 mph NCAP crash test. Some real world populations characteris- tics are described, particularly the ranges in sitting position, weights, sitting heights and biomechanical tolerance variation. Some of the population characteristics of frontal crash severities are also summa- rized. The desirable parameters of future restraint systems which would have variable characteristics are outlined in an effort to address these population issues. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940532. (SP- 1045) Human occupant kinematic response to low speed rear-end impacts. Thomas J. Szabo , Judson B. Welcher, Robert D. Anderson, Michelle M. Rice, Jennifer A. Ward, Lori R. Paulo, and Nicholas J. Carpenter, Biodynamics Engineering, Inc. Human volunteer kinematic response to low speed rear-end colli- sions was investigated. Nominal 16 kph (10 mph) car-to-car impacts were conducted, using human volunteers and anthropomorphic dummies. The human volunteers were both male and female, aged 27 to 58 years, with various degrees of cervical and lumbar spinal degeneration (documented by MRI scan) at the time of the tests. Human volunteer response was monitored and analyzed via acceler- ometers and high speed film. The impacts resulted in no injury to any of the human volunteers, and no objective changes in the condition of their cervical or lumbar spines. The results indicate a minimum injury tolerance to low speed rear-end impacts for males and females with various degrees of spi- nal degeneration. Kinematic responses of the head, mandible, upper torso and knees are discussed in light of existing theories regarding injury causation and tolerance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940533. Influence of wheel resonance on tire acoustic cavity noise. R. W. Scavuzzo, L. T. Charek, and P. M. Sandy, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.; and G. D. Shteinhauz, PG Engineering Co. The acoustic cavity inside the tire-wheel assembly is known to contribute to audible noise in the passenger compartment of some vehicles. Traditionally, the source of this noise issue has been viewed as only response from the acoustic resonance of the air cav- ity inside the tire-wheel assembly. This paper demonstrates that cou- pling between the cavity resonance and a structural resonance of the wheel can amplify the response and result in higher noise levels in the passenger compartment. Laboratory measurements show that vehicle interior noise generated when coupling occurs between the cavity resonance and a structural resonance of the wheel is signifi- cantly higher than when the coupling is eliminated. This phenome- non is demonstrated by comparing vehicle noise levels which results from two different wheel designs: one that has a structural resonance very near the acoustic resonance and one that does not. In addition, a finite element modeling technique capable of simulating spindle vibration resulting from the cavity resonance is introduced. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940534. Development of the SAE J 1981 road hazard impact test for wheel and tire assemblies. Trevor J. Brown, Trevor Brown Agency, Inc.; and Rick S. Wallace, General Motors Corp. The SAE J175 Impact Test in its original and revised form was developed to simulate side impact on wheels under vehicle roll- over conditions. Wheel users and manufacture's have tried to use J 175 test fixture, with 90 degree impact, to evaluate the performance of the rim during frontal pot hole or curb impacts. With drop mass so high and the velocity so low there has been poor correlation with actual field testing. A lower mass higher velocity impact test has been developed that effectively reproduces road hazard impact dam- age under controlled and reproducible conditions. This paper pro- vides readers with the background information that led to the devel- opment of the new Road Hazard Impact Test - SAE Recommended Practice J 1981. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940535. Integrity assessment of repaired cast-aluminum automotive wheels. Ellen E. Youngblood, Lehigh Univ.; Gary A. Miller, Concurrent Technologies Corp. ; and Daryl L. Robbins and George J. Herschman, Wheel Collision Center. A collaborative program between the Wheel Collision Center of Bath, PA and Lehigh University was undertaken to: (1) develop the process of repairing cast-aluminum automotive wheels, and (2) assess the structural integrity of the repairs. Structural integrity test- ing involved the application of bending moments to open the rim-to- flange juncture of the wheel cross section, simulating deformation in an accident. Of the various repair procedures employed, hot straightening, and hot straightening and welding were found to be essentially non- damaging to the wheel's structural integrity. The best properties in the welded material resulted from closely matching or slightly undermatching the wheel composition with that of the consumable welding electrode. Cosmetic welding has little effect on repair integ- rity, but cold straightening was found to decrease the maximum load to failure. 940536. Reduction in weight of steel wheels by development of 780 MPa- grade hot rolled steel sheets. Isao Machida, Masayuki N arita, and Ryota Kureura, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; 66</page><page sequence="66">940536-940543 Masahiko Morita and N oblio Aoyagi, Kawasaki Steel Corp.; and Masaru Sano, Kanai Motor Wheel Co., Inc. Two new types of high-strength 780 MPa-grade hot rolled steel sheets were developed for use in wheel discs and rims, which are the structural parts of the wheel. The fundamental composition of the disc material is 0.08%C-1. 5%Si-1.75%Mn-0.1%Ti. The basic material is a dual phase, ferrite- martensite steel, with precipitation strengthening of the soft ferrite phase by TiC. The aim of hardening the ferrite phase is to suppress the difference in hardness between the ferrite and martensite phases, and thus secure good stretch flangeability. The fundamental compositions of the rim material is 0.09%C-1. 7%Mn-0.05%Nb-0.15%Ti. This steel is based on a ferrite-bainite material and is precipitation strengthened using NbC and TiC. Although 590 MPa-grade steel had been considered to represent the limit of formability for wheels, a 30% increase in strength was achieved in the newly developed materials, while maintaining good formability. This makes it possible to reduce the thickness of discs and rims and achieve a reduction of approximately 10% in wheel weight. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940537. Weldable preprimed steel. Cornelius Pie tersen, Hoo- govens Groep B. V. In cooperation with supplier of coating materials we have devel- oped a weldable preprimed steel for automotive applications. In this paper we present the performance of the material. Important aspects of this performance are formability, corrosion resistance and spot weldability. Forming the material does not cause delamination of the paint film. The corrosion resistance is as good as a cataphoretic reference panel used in the automotive industry. The spot welda- bility is superior to a hot dip galvanized reference. 940538. Development of anti-corrosion steel sheet containing copper for automobile body parts. Toru Sano, Yukiyasu S hi roi, Yoshimitsu Fukui, and Shigeru Usuda, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. An investigation of anti-corrosion steel sheets (non- galvanized) which contain copper for automobile body parts has been con- ducted. Copper additives accelerate the formation of amorphous substrates. These substrates decrease the rate of corrosion. In order to retain the steel's formability and weldability, the con- tents of the alloying elements have been optimized. As a result, this newly developed steel sheet can be used for many different applica- tions such as door sashes and door panels of mass produced cars. This paper describes the key properties of the newly developed steel sheet and additionally the mechanism of corrosion prevention, weldability, formability, and so on. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940539. Improvements in formability and spot weldability of galvannealed steel sheet. Youichi Tobiyama, Chiaki Kato, Akira Yasuda, Kazuo Mochizuki, and Nobuyuki Morito, Kawasaki Steel Corp. Modifications in the properties of galvannealed steel sheet have been made to meet the needs of the automotive industry. The press formability (powdering and flaking) of the galvannealed steel sheet is very sensitive to the phase composition and coating weight of the coating. The allowable coatings for a satisfactory anti-powdering property may fail to provide the anti-flaking property, showing a high coefficient of friction due to the existence of a soft phase, Ç,at the surface. In this study, the effects of an inorganic film on the sur- face of the galvannealed coating were studied improving press for- mability. It was found that a thin borax film was effective to mini- mize surface friction and to improve anti-flaking properties. Short electrode life is another problem, as it limits continuous spot welding of the galvannealed steel sheet. During welding, elec- trode tips (Cu) are consumed by an interaction with the coating and the steel substrate. A small amount of B addition in the ultra-low carbon steel substrate was found to be effective in increasing the electrode life by reducing this interaction. Thus, galvannealed steel sheet becomes one of the best balanced materials for automotive panels when used with a borax coating and B addition to the ultra- low carbon steel substrate. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940541. Chrome effluent reduction in the treatment of alumi- num refrigeration components. Mark A. Kuehner, Betz Metchem; and Chris Wagner, Ford Motor Co. Rinseable chromáte coatings have historically been the treatment of choice for aluminum automotive refrigeration components because of their excellent corrosion resistance. Major efforts have been underway to develop alternative non- chrome aluminum treat- ments to provide performance equivalent to chrome without the gen- eration of expensive and hazardous wastes. The approach to eliminate chromáte effluents has been two- fold. As a first step, a chrome-bearing non-rinseable treatment was devel- oped which provides all the benefits of a chromáte treatment while substantially reducing the amount of hexavalent chrome in the efflu- ent. However, since this "Dried-In-Place" system still utilizes chro- mium compounds in its operation, it is considered to be only an intermediate step in the total elimination of chrome in the manufac- turing process. This paper will describe the results of several years manufacturing experience with a non-rinseable chrome coating used on air conditioner condensers. A second, and more long-term approach, is the use of a com- pletely chrome-free coating process, which will totally eliminate all chromium compounds from the manufacturing environment. This paper will also describe the promising performance achieved in a cooperative effort between automotive manufacturers and vendors in the development of a truly chrome- free treatment system for automotive refrigeration components. 940542. Low VOC automotive clearcoats. Basil V. Gre- gorovich and Robert R. Matheson, Jr., E.I. Dupont de Nemours and Co. Automotive manufacturers are facing changes to automotive clearcoat materials and process because of the Amended Clean Air Act. The available options, abatement and water, high solids and powder coatings, have been reviewed. All may have value depend- ing on specific circumstances. However high solids clears appear to offer the most flexible and timely response to regulations. The tech- nical feasibility of very low VOC liquid coatings is examined in this paper. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940543. Impelementation strategies for the Ford waste mini- mization program. William F. Schneider, Ford Motor Co. The environmental impact of manufacturing operations is a con- tinuing concern due to increasing regulatory pressures, heightening public awareness about the environment, and rising costs associated with the treatment and disposal of wastes. Ford Motor Company has adopted a proactive waste minimization strategy for handling manu- facturing emissions in a cost-effective fashion. A waste opportunity assessment was performed at the Livonia Transmission Plant and succeeded in identifying over $1 .2 million in waste reduction oppor- tunities. The assessment suggests that immediate, low-cost opportu- nities to reduce waste generation exist at Ford facilities. These short- term opportunities can be addressed without major process or facil- ity modifications, but they do require a greater investment in time and resources to identify problem areas and to act on them. A guide- book and training program have been developed to assist plants in forming waste minimization teams and conducting internal assess- ments to realize the first tier opportunities. The training will be used to establish teams at various Ford locations. Many long-range opportunities also exist; to realize them requires more uniform and accurate facility reporting, more information on the environmental impacts of hazardous and toxic wastes, and consideration of waste generation earlier in the manufacturing and product design pro- cesses. 67</page><page sequence="67">940545-940550 940545. (SP- 1027) Performance of HD-DI-diesel engine with addition of ethanol and rapeseed oil. J. Czerwiński , Engineering College Biel-Bienne. Some alternative fuels which can be produced in the agriculture may be suitable for engine applications, particularly in the the cases of self-supply. Use of pure alcohol and crude plant oil as fuels poses some problems. This paper analyzes several potential applications using mixtures of ethanol, crude rape oil or a combination of both. The analysis of injection, combustion and of the total emissions was carried out. Additives influences on emission and combustion characteristics depend on the engine's operational range. In general ethanol decreases particulate emissions, increases ignition delay due to the lower cetane number and shortens combustion duration. Crude rape oil increases the emissions of particulates and affects less the com- bustion speed. Both diminish full load torque due to the lower calo- ric value. 30% ethanol - 15% rape oil mixtures were used to obtain on the investigated HD-DI-engine emissions, similar to conventional die- sel fuel. However, this was accompanied by power reductions, up to 12.5%. 940546. (SP- 1027) A PC-based fuel and ignition control sys- tem used to map the 3- D surfaces of torque and emissions ver- sus air-fuel ratio and ignition timing. M. L. Franklin, D. B. Kittel- son, and R. H. Leuer, University of Minnesota; and M. J. Pipho, DAI Technologies, Inc. A system was designed for controlling fuel injection and ignition timing for use on a port fuel injected, gas-fueled engine. Inputs required for the system include manifold absolute pressure, mani- fold air temperature, a once per revolution crankshaft pulse, a once per cycle camshaft pulse, and a relative encoder pulse train to deter- mine crank angle. A prototype card installed in the computer con- tains counters and discrete logic which control the timing of ignition and injection events. High current drivers used to control the fuel injector solenoids and coil primary current are optically isolated from the computer by the use of fiber optic cables. The program- ming is done in QuickBASIC running in real time on a 25 MHz 80486 personal computer. The system was used to control a gas-fueled spark ignition engine at various conditions to map the torque versus air-fuel ratio and ignition timing. Each surface was mapped for a given fuel flow and speed. At constant fuel flow, fuel composition, and engine speed, thermal efficiency is proportional to torque. Therefore, the air-fuel ratio and ignition timing for best torque is also that for best thermal efficiency. NOx and HC maps were also measured to deter- mine the tradeoffs between efficiency and emissions. Natural gas, propane, and propylene were used to determine the effect of differ- ent fuels. The results show that changing composition could have an effect on optimum air-fuel ratio and ignition timing. The engine used for the experiments was an in-line four cylinder Volkswagen 1.7 liter spark ignition engine with gaseous sequential port fuel injection. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940547. (SP- 1027) Synchronous, simultaneous optimization of ignition timing and air-fuel ratio in a gas-fueled spark igni- tion engine. M. L. Franklin, D. B. Kittelson, and R. H. Leuer, Uni- versity of Minnesota; and M. J. Pipho, DAI Technologies, Inc. A two-dimensional optimization process which simultaneously adjusts the spark timing and air-fuel ratio of a lean-burn natural gas fueled engine has been demonstrated. This has been done by first mapping the thermal efficiency against spark timing and equiva- lence ratio at a single speed and load combination to obtain the 3-D surface of efficiency versus the other two variables. Then the ability of the control system to find and hold the combination of timing and air-fuel ratio which gives the highest thermal efficiency was explored. The control system described in SAE Paper No. 940546 was used to map the thermal efficiency versus equivalence ratio and ignition timing. NOx, CO, and HC maps were also obtained to determine the tradeoffs between efficiency and emissions. A load corresponding to a brake mean effective pressure of 0.467 MPa was maintained by a water brake dynamometer. A speed of 2000 rpm was maintained by a fuel-controlled governor. The optimization process adds small synchronous disturbances to the spark timing and air flow while the fuel injected per cycle is held constant for four cycles. The engine speed response to these disturbances in used to determine the optimum values of spark tim- ing and air-fuel ratio. For the condition tested, the control system found and held the equivalence ratio and spark timing corresponding to the maximum thermal efficiency. The maximum thermal effi- ciency was about 10% while NOx emissions were about 50% lower than for stoichiometric operation. This approach offers the promise of an engine control process in which the engine itself is the primary sensor. The control system is fully adaptive to changes in fuel composition, operating conditions, engine wear, or other factors which may not be easily measured. It allows the engine to continuously remap itself. 940548. (SP- 1027) Dual fuel natural gas/diesel engines: tech- nology, performance, and emissions. Christopher S. Weaver and Sean H. Turner, Engine, Fuel, and Emissions Engineering, Inc. This paper summarizes a review of dual-fuel natural gas/diesel engine technology carried out for the Gas Research Institute. In the past, dual-fuel natural gas/diesel engines have been relegated to a few small niche markets, but our review has shown that dual-fuel engine technology has significant potential. Potential advantages of dual-fuel engines include diesel-like efficiency and brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) with much lower emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter. New technologies offer solu- tions to the problems of poor efficiency and emissions at light load. Dual-fuel engines can be designed to operate interchangeably on natural gas with a diesel pilot, or on 100% diesel fuel. Many existing diesels can be converted to dual-fuel operation. Preliminary eco- nomic analyses show that such conversions could be justified from the fuel cost savings alone in applications such as railroad locomo- tives, marine vessels, mine trucks, and diesel power generation sys- tems. 940549. (SP- 1027) Understanding the potential of the non- aftercooled Navistar 7.3T CNG engine. D. P. Clarke, I. J. Penny, and D. A. Wise, Ricardo Consulting Engineers, Ltd. ; and P. K. Das, Navistar International Transportation Corp. This paper describes the continued development of the Navistar 7.3 liter V8 CNG engine. The project background, objectives and preliminary results have already been described. Development results show that U.S. 1994 emissions standards can be comfortably met without the use of electronic air fuel ratio control or an oxidation catalyst. Transient cycle emissions of 1.7 g/bhph NOx + NMHC have been obtained from de-rated engines to be used in field demonstra- tion vehicles. Electronic control will allow 2.5 g/bhph NOx + NMHC to be achieved without de-rating. Further emissions reduction without aftertreatment will depend on aftercooling, which also offers the potential for an increased rating. 940550. Competitive intelligence for the automotive industry using electronic sources. Marydee Ojala, Ojala &amp; Associates. The automotive industry is global in nature. Competitive threats can come from anywhere in the world. To compete effectively, the automotive industry must be able to keep on top of competitors' plans and actions. Also important is tracking trends in the industry, noting the activities of suppliers, following changing labor relations philosophies, and focusing on customer requirements. Information, particularly that which can be garnered from commercial, remote 68</page><page sequence="68">940550-940557 databases, is a critical component of any company's management strategy. 940551. High strength HNBR - The new benchmark elasto- mer for automotive synchronous and serpentine belts. William G. Bradford and Michael E. Wood , Zeon Chemicals, Inc. Global competition in the automotive industry, specifically new trends in engine design, involve the replacement of traditional engines with high performance overhead cam engines and multi valve designs. This has created a unique challenge to the engineer- ing of timing belts with increasing underhood temperatures due to hotter running engines and compact engine compartments. These factors along with increased load bearing requirements has pushed traditional synchronous belt materials beyond their limits. Materials suppliers and belt manufacturers have combined efforts to develop new designs and materials which address these performance needs. This paper evaluates the performance of past, present and future belt compounds including polychloroprene (CR), alkylated chloro- sulfonated polyethylene (ACSM), hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR), and high strength HNBR utilizing static and dynamic testing equipment. These findings illustrate that high strength HNBR will provide improved heat and ozone resistance, higher abrasion resistance and improved dynamic performance. Its higher load bearing capabilities will help establish this material as the new benchmark for extended warranties and dynamic perfor- mance in synchronous and serpentine belts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940552. Polybenzimidazole based materials in automotive tribological applications. T. E. Andres, Hoechst Celanese Corp. Thermally, mechanically, and tribologically demanding automo- tive applications have, for many years, belonged exclusively to met- als. Metals were the only materials to exhibit the high temperature mechanical properties and low part costs required for under-the- hood and transmission applications within the automotive industry. Now a new family of plastic materials is breaking fresh ground in these demanding automotive applications. This new family of ultra- high performance polybenzimidazole, PBI, based materials is cur- rently being tested for use as piston rings, valve seals, transmission thrust washers, and air conditioning compressor vanes just to name a few. Applications with the most profound advances are centered around the combustion chamber such as the oil control rings and valve stem seals. Significant environmental and performance advan- tages of PBI based materials in the combustion chamber are explained with detailed test results. The attributes that enable PBI to penetrate demanding automo- tive applications and distinguish PBI from other ultra-high tempera- ture polymeric materials are exceptional tribological performance, mechanical strength at temperature, extremely low creep, seala- bility, and especially, minimal processing costs. This paper will examine the mechanical, thermal, and tribological properties and processing methods that permit Celazole® PBI based materials to access these traditionally metal applications. Within the scope of automotive applications, the materials' s characteristics and advan- tages will be detailed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940553. Use of EPR rubbers in engine mounts as related to polymer structure and compound. Silvia Caldari and Massimo Demaio, EniChem Elastomeri. The study of structural characteristics determining the dynamic behavior of raw and compounded ethylene-propylene elastomers, has shown their potentialities as components for vibration damping and control. As a result, proper EP copolymers and terpolymers have been compounded and tested, that exhibit promising dynamic stiffness values and good mechanical characteristics, together with well-known EPR resistance to temperature and aging; this shows the possibility to employ such materials in engine mounts, in place of natural rubber. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940554. Valve lifter guides - The development of a nylon internal engine component. Dale Moretz, Mid-American Products, Inc.; and Stephen M. Hartig, DSM Engineering Plastics. Continued development in the area of polymer chemistry, alloy- ing and compounding and growing understanding of engineering principles as applied to thermoplastic materials has allowed consid- erable expansion of the applications for thermoplastics in areas for- merly not considered for these materials. The development of a thermoplastic roller valve lifter guide described in this paper illustrates some of the principles and tech- niques which can be used to develop aggressively innovative appli- cations for thermoplastic materials and emphasized the advantages to be gained by applying simultaneous engineering principles in such developments. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940555. Designing composite engine sealing components. Marie Winkler and Dan Gosen, Dow Chemical Co. The market for composite engine oil sealing components, such as valve covers and oil pans, continues to expand, replacing tradi- tional metal stamping and die casting materials. As the market for these composite components grows, so must the understanding of the material performance characteristics and the relationship of these characteristics to the design of the part. Unlike metals, com- posites are viscoelastic in nature, exhibiting time-temperature dependant properties. Therefore, the traditional design approach uti- lizing static property data to predict long-term performance under load and over a wide temperature range will not sufficiently charac- terize the nonlinear property response of polymeric-based compos- ites. A robust composite sealing design requires complete materials characterization, including long-term creep performance as a func- tion of temperature, loading, and cycling. During the product development stage of an engine sealing sys- tem, the use of finite element techniques is a viable approach to modeling component performance. Dynamic, long-term material performance data is critical in this modeling, because the available sealing force begins to change as the materials creep and relax, thus directly impacting the sealing ability of the system. This paper will present the creep performance of various thermoset composite mate- rials and show how this information can be used to provide essential design criteria to generate targeted sealing force for the under-the- hood component. 940556. (SP- 1023) The NGV challenge - Student participa- tion, faculty involvement, and costs. Richard M. Lueptow, North- western Univ. Automotive design projects offer an outstanding opportunity for students to obtain practical experience in engineering design. Over the last three years student groups have competed in one such proj- ect, The Natural Gas Vehicle Challenge, which involved converting a pickup truck to be fueled by natural gas. This paper reports a sur- vey of faculty advisors involved with the project at the competing universities. Fifteen students were typically involved in the project at each university participating in the competition. Five or six were usually "key" to the project. Usually faculty advisors had a research interest in automotive engineering or alternate fuels, and they often incorporated the project into a design course. Although the funding level for such a design project varied substantially, the typical funding level for one year was about $25,000, most of which came from local sponsors. Faculty advisors often commented on the educational value of the project and their satisfaction in working closely with students. 940557. (SP- 1023) Analysis of data from electric and hybrid electric vehicle student competitions. Keith B. Wipke, National Renewable Energy Laboratory; and Nicole Hill and Robert P. Lar- sen, Ar gonne National Laboratory. The U.S. Department of Energy sponsored several student engi- neering competitions in 1993 that provided useful information on electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The electrical energy usage 69</page><page sequence="69">940557-940567 from these competitions has been recorded with a custom- built digi- tal meter installed in every vehicle and used under controlled condi- tions. When combined with other factors, such as vehicle mass, speed, distance traveled, battery type, and type of components, this information provides useful insight into the performance character- istics of electrics and hybrids. All the vehicles tested were either electric vehicles or hybrid vehicles in electric-only mode, and had an average energy economy of 7.0 km/kWh. Based on the perfor- mance of the "ground-up" hybrid electric vehicles in the 1993 Hybrid Electric Vehicle Challenge, data revealed a 1 km/kWh energy economy benefit for every 133 kg decrease in vehicle mass. By running all the electric vehicles at a competition in Atlanta at several different constant speeds, the effects of rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag were evaluated. On average, these vehicles were 32% more energy efficient at 40 km/h than at 72 km/h. The results of the competition data analysis confirm that these engineer- ing competitions not only provide an education experience for the students, but also show technology performance and improvements in electric and hybrid vehicles by setting benchmarks and revealing trends. 940558. (SP- 1045) An advanced finite element data base of the Hybrid III test dummy - Phase I - model generation and sled test validation. Lars, A. Fredriksson and Larsgunnar Nilsson, Lin- köping Univ. We are concerned with the development of an advanced finite element (FE) model of the Hybrid III dummy. The Hybrid III model is closely corresponding to the mechanical dummy with respect to geometry, segment masses and inertia properties. The model is crated to serve as an occupant data base in an explicit FE program. Therefore, much work is put on generality in positioning, model refinement, contact definitions and choice of material models. Initial validations by sled test simulations show that the rigid ver- sion of the FE dummy has a potential to reproduce results obtained in rigid body programs, and in the future also reproduce test results obtained with the mechanical Hybrid III dummy with reasonable accuracy. 940561. Sensing side impacts. David S. Breed, W. Thomas - Sanders, and Vittorio Castelli, Automotive Technologies Interna- tional, Inc. Now that airbags are the accepted solution for protecting occu- pants in frontal impacts, and now that safety sells cars, it is natural to look closely at the second largest killer of automobile occupants, side impacts. This paper develops the theory of sensing side impacts based on the assumption that airbags will soon be used for side impact protection. The trade- offs between the various sensor tech- nologies are discussed including electronic and mechanical sensors. For mechanical sensors, fluid damped, undamped and crush sensing switches are compared. Finally, the requirements for a successful predictive sensor will be presented. 940562. (SP- 1045) Collision performance of automotive door systems. David Blaisdell and Gregory Stephens, Collision Research &amp; Analysis, Inc.; and Uwe Meissner, Volkswagen of America, Inc. Historically, most safety related improvements to door systems have involved retention of occupants within the vehicle. However, such improvements have not been without some safety trade-offs. The recent update to FMVSS 214 (Side Impact Protection) has focused attention on increased occupant protection in side impacts. The standard essentially increases vehicle side strength require- ments in order to reduce intrusion into the occupant space. The safety consequences associated with strengthening vehicle side structure will be evaluated with respect to various impact configura- tions. Energy management considerations of current as well as con- ceptual door systems during a collision will also be discussed. Indi- vidual latch and hinge component testing as currently required by FMVSS 206 does not completely evaluate the collision performance of the door as a system. From field collision evaluation, it has been seen that doors and surrounding side structure must act as a system to efficiently manage collision forces and distribute occupant loads. Procedures for evaluating current and future door systems by means of revised laboratory testing procedure will be evaluated. 940563. Comparison of BIOSID and EUROSID-1 dummies in full-vehicle crash tests. Sherman Henson, Robert Hultman, Roger Daniel, Anthony Spadafora, and Ishwar Parekh, Ford Motor Co. As a continuation of the AAMA side impact test procedure eval- uation, the Association conducted six full-vehicle crash tests accord- ing to the NHTSA FMVSS 214 test procedure, but using a EURO- SID- 1 dummy for the NHTSA SID. The purpose of these tests was to evaluate the EUROSID-1 dummy and compare its responses to the BIOSID dummies previously tested by AAMA under identical conditions. Repeat tests of mid-size Pontiac vehicles with padded and unpadded door interiors were run. The tests showed that the EUROSID-1 dummy chest deflection and viscous criterion responses are not repeatable, especially in the rear seat. In addition, it was found that the EUROSID-1 and BIOSID chest deflection responses were different and, sometimes, are directionally opposite. 940564. (SP- 1030) Impact center and restitution coefficients for accident reconstruction. Hirotoshi Ishikawa, Japan Automo- bile Research Institute, Inc. Based on a previously presented two-dimensional car-to-car impact model, automobile collision tests were analyzed to under- stand the relationship of the impact center to the residual vehicle deformation, which is essential for improving the reliability of the impact model. The results from a number of automobile collision tests indicated that the impact centers of the two vehicles at the end of collision were located near the center of the contacting surface when the vehicle deformation is maximized. This leads to a method of defining the impact center from the crush profile at the time of maximum deformation. The relationships of the normal and tangen- tial restitution coefficients to the collision type were also presented, discussed and evaluated to obtain some guidelines on how to choose the restitution coefficients from impact conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940566. (SP- 1030) Conservation of momentum analysis of two-dimensional colliding bodies, with or without trailers. Gregory C. Smith, Collision Safety Engineering, Inc. This paper presents a method of automobile collision analysis based on conservation of momentum. The analysis is applied to the collision of two two-dimensional bodies, either or both of which may be attached to a trailer. Newton's laws of motion are employed to determine changes in linear and angular velocities for the two-dimensional colliding bodies. Knowing the masses and rotational inertias and the initial velocities of all bodies at impact, the post-impact velocities can be calculated if appropriate constraints are applied to the bodies' post- collision motion. Various motion constraints, including lock-up, slip, and restitution are examined, and a methodology for modeling vehicle motion experienced during a collision is presented. The full set of basic equations characterizing this conservation-of- momentum analysis is presented with sufficient detail to allow their implementation on a programmable calculator or personal com- puter. A Windows™-based computer program written to implement the method is introduced. Called PLASMO, the programs's accuracy is briefly examined by comparison to previously published reconstruc- tions of instrumented crash tests. 940567.

Daubert, Search Engineering, Inc. Accident reconstruction normally involves the travel of vehicles on a roadway. Many times it is important to know the attributes of the roadway because the roadway contributed to the accident or the geometries of the roadway help determine courses of travel or vehi- cle positions. Knowledge of reading the characteristics of the high- way from construction drawings therefore becomes important. 940570. (SP- 1030) Spot weld failure analysis for accident reconstruction. Richard I. Garber and H. Fred Chen, S.E. A., Inc.; and Dennis A. Guenther, Ohio State Univ. Adequacy of resistance spot welds in low carbon steels in rela- tion to structural integrity can become an issue in the reconstruction of automotive accidents. Because formation of a plug (or button or slug) in a peel test is used as a quality control criterion for welds, it is sometimes assumed conversely that a weld which failed is defective if no plug is present. Spot welds do not necessarily form a plug when fractured. Fracture behavior of spot welds both by over- load and fatigue is reviewed. Then techniques for examinations of Field failures are discussed. Finally two case histories are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940571. Glenn H. Curtiss: an early American innovator in aviation and motorcycle engines. Larry M. Rinek, SRI Interna- tional. Glenn H. Curtiss (1878-1930), an early member of the SAE, was one of America's premier aviation pioneers, a self-taught engineer, and creator of a broad series of commercially successful engines for both aviation and motorcycles. Best known for his aerial accom- plishments (from the 1908 June Bug to World War 1 aircraft, such as the JN-4 Jenny trainer), Curtiss developed solid experience with engines long before (dating back to 1901). His early interest in bicy- cle racing led to motorcycling and his motorcycle engines evolved into aero engines - First for airships, then aeroplanes. Curtiss engines of this era (the most familiar are his V-8 4-stroke water- cooled designs) were noted for advanced construction materials, lighter- than-average weight, reasonable reliability and some inno- vative mechanical features. Curtiss engines were not the most radi- cal or advanced examples of the art, but were sufficiently respected and built well enough to capture the majority of the early U.S. air- craft engine business to the WW1 era and slightly beyond. Much has already been written about Curtiss and his aircraft work but much less has appeared on his distinguished engines. Accordingly, this paper will address early Curtiss engines from 1901 to 1918, after which the inventor was largely disengaged from the business. The piston aircraft engine enterprise founded by Cur- tiss continued on, merged with Wright in 1929, and finally ceased production in the early 1960s. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940575. Life cycle management - A solution for decision making in the global market. Robert J. Kainz, Chrysler Corp.; Michael S. Simpson, U.S. Congress; and W. Charles Moeser, Chrys- ler Corp. Environmental issues continue to impact operations in the auto industry. With the introduction of the new Clean Air Act Amend- ments (CAAA), a new emphasis away from traditional command and control regulations towards technology driven regulations has begun. Innovative ways of meeting the new regulations are more essential than ever before. The Life Cycle Management (LCM) approach combines sound environmental decision-making with good business practices. This management approach focuses on the total cost impact of a decision throughout the entire life of the prod- uct, process and material. LCM concentrates its efforts up front at the product's developmental stage where 80% of all cost savings can be gained. LCM is not a formula for success. It is an approach which stimu- lates corporate cultural changes to produce quality, environmental friendly products at the lowest total cost. It provides the means to address environmental costs, once viewed as an overhead cost, as a true product and/or process cost. This new cost serves as the cata- lyst for a transition from a reactive to a proactive environmental pro- gram. LCM allows managers and decision makers to view air and waste emissions along with solid waste disposal as lost profits and non-value added cost burdens to both product and plant. This approach forges a strong bond between design and manufacturing that did not previously exist in the auto industry to meet regulatory requirements by examining all product costs. It preserves our agility to manufacture under stricter environmental regulations without a loss of quality or increase in non-value cost to the customer. At Chrysler, LCM has become a natural extension of our platform approach to building cars and trucks. To compete in the global mar- ket place, U.S. manufacturing corporations must accept and utilize LCM principles. The regulatory impact on our domestic industry will become more restrictive on those corporations that fail to accept change and will eventually eliminate them from the global market- place regardless of their past performance or size. 940579. Effect of gasoline olefin composition on predicted ozone in 2005/2010 - Auto/oil air quality improvement research program. Charles H. Schleyer and William J. Koehl, Mobile Research and Development Corp.; William R. Leppard and Alan M. Dunker, General Motors Corp.; and Greg Yarwood, Jonathan P. Cohen, and Alison K. Pollack, Systems Applications International. The effect of gasoline olefin composition and content on urban ozone was estimated using the Urban Airshed Model (UAM), emis- sion measurements for a base fuel, and projected emission for two hypothetical fuels with reduced olefin content. The projected emis- sions for the hypothetical fuels were developed using regressions developed from Auto/Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Pro- gram (AQIRP) Phase 1 testing, a vapor headspace model and other information. Ozone modeling was conducted for Los Angeles in year 2010 and Dallas-Fort Worth and New York in year 2005. When all olefins were removed from the base fuel, the light-duty vehicle contribution to peak hourly ozone was reduced by 8 to 12%. This corresponds to a projected reduction of 0.6 to 0.8% in total peak ozone from all sources. Removing only light (C5) oleFins provided 67 to 78% of the peak ozone beneFit from removal of all olefins. Reducing fuel C5 olefin content was estimated to be 3.5 to 6 times more effective in reducing peak ozone than reducing heavier olefins (Cö'd+) by an equal volume percent. The effect of oleFins on pre- dicted ozone was due primarily to a reduction in the reactivity of evaporative, running loss and refueling/storage emissions. There is uncertainty in the predicted effects; in particular, the effect of olefin reduction expressed as a percentage of total peak ozone from all sources may be underestimated. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940581.

Chládek, M. C. Papiita Peck, J. E. Weir, D. Schuet- zle, and T. E. Jensen, Ford Motor Co. 71</page><page sequence="71">940581-940587 A study was carried out to increase our understanding of the emissions of air toxics from normal and high-emitting vehicles. This study is part of a larger study on fuel effects in high- emitting vehi- cles, and is part of the Auto/Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Program (AQIRP). Detailed measurements were carried out on the emissions of two vehicles run on industry- average gasoline. The two vehicles, having similar emissions control technologies, repre- sent a high-emitting vehicle and a normal-emitting vehicle. In addi- tion to the regulated emissions (HC, CO and NOx), a detailed chemi- cal analysis was carried out on the gas- and particle-phase non- regulated emissions. The vehicles were tested over the U.S. EPA UDDS driving schedule. The high emitter was highly variable with regard to emis- sions, but always operated rich of the stoichiometric point. Up to 46% of fuel carbon was emitted as CO and unburned HC for the high emitter, compared to less than 1 .4% for the normal emitter. Par- ticle mass emissions were approximately 4-7x higher for the high emitter; however, extractable PAHs on the particles were 15-100x higher. The air-toxic species: benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formalde- hyde, and acetaldehyde were emitted at rates of 10-40x higher from the high-emitter vehicle than from the normal-emitter vehicle. 1 994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940582. Real world emissions variability as measured by remote sensors. Robert D. Stephens, Michael T. Giles, and Peter J. Groblicki, General Motors Corp.; Robert A. Gorse, Jr. and Ken- neth J. McAlinden, Ford Motor Co.; Dougles B. Hoffman, Chrysler Corp. ; and Rodger James and Sam Smith, Michigan Department of State. During the fall of 1992, the Michigan Roadside Study was con- ducted. During this study IM240 tests were conducted on vehicles that had also been emissions tested during on-road operation via two remote sensors that were separated by 100 feet. The use of two remote sensors provided an indication of the short-term-real-world emissions variability of a large number of on-road vehicles. This data was used to determine the frequency of flippers, i.e., vehicles that are sometimes high emitters (&gt;4%CO) and at other times low emitters (&lt;2%CO). The data show that the flipper frequency increases for older model year vehicles. Also, the correlations between remote sensor readings of emissions concentrations and IM240 mass emissions rates were determined. The data show that the correlation between remote sensing and IM240 improves with increasing numbers of remote sensing readings. For three remote sensor readings, CO correlates with an r2 of 0.69 and HC correlates with a r2 of 0.54. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940584. (SP- 1025) Development of a fiber reinforced alumi- num piston for heavy duty diesel engines. Reinaldo Soave, Jose M. M. Leites, and Gustavo F erran, Metal Leve SA Ind. e Com.; and Charles W. Kuhn, and Gerald A. Gegel, Caterpillar, Inc. This paper discusses a joint customer-supplier program intended to further develop the ability to design and apply aluminum alloy pistons selectively reinforced with ceramic fibers for heavy duty diesel engines. The approach begins with a comprehensive mechani- cal properties evaluation of base and reinforced material. The results demonstrated significant fatigue strength improvement due to fiber reinforcement, specially at temperatures greater than 300°C. A sim- plified numerical analysis is performed to predict the temperature and fatigue factor values at the combustion bowl area for conven- tional and reinforced aluminum piston designs for a 6.6 liter engine. It concludes that reinforced piston have a life expectation longer than conventional aluminum piston. Structural engine tests under severe conditions of specific power and peak cylinder pressure were used to confirm the results of the cyclic properties evaluation and numerical analysis. As predicted, the conventional aluminum pis- tons failed at the bowl rim, while the ceramic fiber reinforced pis- tons did not. The results demonstrated that selective ceramic fiber reinforcement is a technical solution for extending the use of alumi- num pistons to heavy duty diesel engines for today's and future applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940585. Design and development of the Jacobs Model 340A Engine Retarder using concurrent development. Kurt E. Frei- burg, Jacobs Vehicle Equipment Co. The Model 340A Engine Retarder represents the first opportunity in Jacob's history with Caterpillar, Incorporated to design the retarder during the development of an engine. This paper explains the development process improvements utilized to produce the Model 340A. There were two primary goals of the project: performance and delivery. The Caterpillar performance goal for this retarder was to bring its new engine in line with the best retarders in the trucking market without sacrificing reliability. This attention by Caterpillar engineers (external concurrent development) positively affected retarder performance and serviceability. The delivery goals were severe by past standards. This pressure resulted in incorporation of new development tools (internal concur- rent development) to meet delivery as well as cost and quality goals. These efforts have resulted in a much stronger customer- supplier relationship, as well as exceeding the original project goals. 940586. (SP- 1025) Benefits of new fuel injection system tech- nology on cold startability of diesel engines - Improvements on cold startability and white smoke reduction by means of multi injection with common rail fuel system (ECD-U2). Isao Ositka, Masataka Nishimura, Yasushi Tanaka, and Masahiko Miyaki, Nip- pondenso Co., Ltd. In the diesel engine field, increasingly strict emission regulations and customer requirements have necessitated advanced technology. One important subject for diesel engines is cold startability and white smoke under cold conditions. In this paper, the combustion mechanism of a multi cylinder engine under cold conditions is dis- cussed. First, during a starting condition, it is proved that the cold flame, which is caused by previously misfired fuel during intermittent com- bustion, promotes good combustion on the following cycle. Secondly, following engine starting, it is estimated that there is minimum fuel quantity above which combustion is carried out. The minimum fuel quantity depends upon the temperature of the com- bustion chamber. Unbalance between the minimum fuel quantity and actual injection quantity results in white smoke emission. From this analysis, in order to improve diesel engine perfor- mance at cold condition, we have introduced a "MULTI INJEC- TION" strategy by using a common rail type fuel injection system, called, "ECD-U2". Great improvement in both cold starting time and white smoke emission are confirmed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940587. (SP- 1025) New Mitsubishi 2.8L four-cylinder diesel engine. N. Osaki, Y Tsutsui, Y. Kakoi, Y. Sakino, and K. Okazaki, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. In the light commercial vehicles (LCV) market, primarily cross- country 4-wheel drive station wagons and derived cargo vans, diesel powered vehicles have been gaining popularity among customers because of their increased fuel economy. In the Japanese market particularly, total sales of such types of vehicles have been rapidly growing. The volume is about 3 times larger than the last five years with diesel engines having a steady share of about 90 percent. Under such circumstances the customers' requirements for diesel vehicles are becoming more severe. Their primary demands have been for increased power, low noise, low vibration and clean smoke, similar to those found in gasoline engines. On the other hand, the exhaust gaseous emission regulations of the diesel engines are getting strict and will become very severe in the near future. 72</page><page sequence="72">940587-940597 We, MITSUBISHI MOTORS CORPORATION, have been pro- ducing a 2.5L 4-cyIinder diesel, the 4D56 Series, for the LCVs.

Bruns , Dana Corp. New emissions requirements for compression ignition engines have led engine designers to review the attributes of positive valve stem seals. Federal standards for particulate emissions were initiated in 1988 for heavy duty diesel engines in the United States. Since then, the standards on particulates have been significantly reduced from .6 g/kW*hr in 1988 to .1 g/kW*hr for 1994. Lowering particu- lates, improving oil economy and reducing guide wear have all become important issues in the heavy duty engine marketplace. All of these factors are affected, in part, by the amount of oil flowing through the clearance between the valve guide and valve stem. Bench tests indicate that heavy duty valve seals could reduce over- head oil consumption by as much as 99% during idle/motoring con- ditions and lower particulate emission levels contributed by lube oil up to 75%. In addition, they can significantly reduce guide wear and valve stem scuffing under turbocharged conditions. 940589. (SP- 1025) Friction measurement in the valve train with a roller follower. Jongmin Lee , Southwest Research Institute; and Donald J. Patterson, Kevin M. Morrison, and George B. Sch- wartz, University of Michigan. The valve train was instrumented to record the instantaneous roller speed, roller pin friction torque, pushrod forces, and cam speed. Results are presented for one exhaust valve of a motored Cummins L-10 engine. The instantaneous cam-roller friction force was determined from the instantaneous roller speed and the pin fric- tion torque. The pushrod force and displacement were also mea- sured. Friction work loss was determine for both cam and roller interface as well as the upper valve train which includes the valve pushrod, rocker arm, valve guide, and valve. Roller follower slip- page on the cam was also determined. A kinematic analysis with the measured data provided the normal force and contact stress at cam/ roller interface. Finally, the valve train friction was found to be in the mixed lubrications regime. Further efforts will address the theoretical analysis of valve train friction to predict roller slippage. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940591.

Corp.; and Xiao-Nan Zhang, Shanghai Jiao-Tong Univ. The distance between cylinder axes (D.B.C. A.) is a fundamental factor for delimiting the engine configuration of all wheeled and cat- erpillar vehicles, shorter the length, more compact the engine overall size. It is also the essential dimension of manufacturing equipment for machining the main components of engine, and will be hardly ever changed once fixed. But is was merely determined by layout drawing in the past. This paper details three main factors for deter- mination of D.B.C.A. A series of semi-empirical formulas were establish using for the engine layout design after other factors affect- ing the design were carefully considered. 940592. (SP- 1025) Optimum sealing design of cylinder head gasket for high peak pressure diesel engines. O samu Aizawa, Masato Yakushiji, and Tsuneo Uno, Marusan Corp. In recent years, in association with the increase of the develop- ment of higher turbocharged diesel engines for commercial vehicles, the requirements for the gas sealing ability of cylinder head gaskets have been getting more severe. This paper introduces the requirements of he optimum design of a cylinder head gasket having the structure that minimizes: 1) the amplitude of motion between a cylinder head and a block and 2) the contact pressure fluctuation of the cylinder head gasket. Both of these are caused by the internal pressure change in the bore of the running engine. In order to examine the relationship of the structure of the various sealing areas with the amplitude of motion and the contact pressure change in cylinder head gaskets, the amplitude between the head and block and the contact pressure changes were empirically observed at three different locations. These were in the vicinity of: 1) the periphery of gas sealing areas, 2) the head bolt openings and 3) the periphery of the gasket bodies. It was found that for the optimum design which minimizes the effects of the internal pressure changes in the bore, it was necessary not only to put sufficient sealing pressure on the gas sealing armors but also to provide adequate contact pressure in the vicinity of their peripheries. 940594.

Sumio Yokoo, Koichi Doi, and Tsutomu Takano, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Takashi Kaimai, Kyodo Oil Technical Research Center Co., Ltd. This paper presents a new refrigeration lubricant for use with the HFC- 134a retrofit refrigerant in automotive air-conditioning sys- tems originally designed to use the CFC- 12 refrigerant, one of the regulated CFCs scheduled to be phased out. This new retrofit lubri- cant provides high lubricity and excellent performance characteris- tics as a result of adopting a newly developed PAG base oil with a block polymer structure and a new antiwear additive formulation. In retrofit systems, it assures sufficient durability for wobble-plate- type variable displacement compressors, which experience severe lubrication conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940595. Application of innovative HNBR elastomers in auto- motive air conditioning systems which use refrigerant R-134a. Michael J. Recchio, Zeon Chemicals, Inc.; and Mark S. Jones, Zeon Chemicals USA, Inc. The Montreal Protocol and subsequent legislation to control the emission of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) have mandated the replace- ment of chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants with hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants. This has resulted in the replacement of R-12 refrigerant with R-134a refrigerant. This change is currently being implemented in automotive air conditioning systems. Significant pressures are accelerating the phaseout of the CFC refrigerants. Work with a group of hydrogenated nitrile rubber elastomers, some of which utilize novel polymerization technology and con- trolled molecular weight distribution, has resulted in some unique materials which are well suited for these types of applications. These hydrogenated polymers were subsequently compounded to yield a new generation of HNBR materials which provide an excellent bal- ance of properties for R-134a refrigerant service. This study will compare these new HNBR's with currently avail- able elastomers in contact with various lubricants and refrigerants. This evaluation will also include permeation resistance, explosive decompression and low-temperature performance. A designed experiment, to optimize permeation resistance, will be evaluated. 940597.

A model of this design was constructed and com- putational analysis was performed to identify the opportunities for improvement. The location and position of the baffle was modified based on the computational fluid dynamic analysis.

(SP- 1040) Studies on the condition of vehicle air con- ditioning systems - Two years after retrofitting to HFC-134aš S. H. Colmery, T. W. Dekleva, and C. L. Jarrell, ICI. This paper is a continuation of a series of papers presented by ICI on the North American retrofit fleet with HFC- 134a. Building on our last paper, which profiled this fleet, this paper describes the results of the studies in which a number of vehicles have bene removed from test, and their air-conditioning systems examined. After an update on performance and service requirements, the paper provides results which include the conditions of the compressors and other components, the quality of the refrigerant and lubricant, and the amount of the refrigerant charge retained. This information will be correlated with previous information to determine the actual efficiency of previously employed clean-out methods. The data indi- cates existing OEM hoses and elastomers are likely to provide suffi- cient containment of HFC- 134a in retrofit situations. Vehicles retro- fit under a variety of procedures (flushed or not) have shown good A/C performance and compressor durability. The refrigerant and lubricant analyses, after the test period, suggest no degradation of the quality of either fluid. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940600.

This study is a joint development project between Chrysler Cor- poration and CFD Research Corporation. The objective of this investigation was to develop a 3D computa- tional flow land heat transfer model for a vehicle windshield de- icing process. The windshield clearing process is a 3D transient, multi-medium, multi-phase heat exchange phenomenon in connec- tion with the air flow distribution in the passenger compartment. The transient windshield de-icing analysis employed conjugate heat transfer methodology and enthalphy method to simulate the velocity distribution near the windshield inside surface, and the time progres- sion of ice-melting pattern on the windshield outside surface. The comparison between the computed results and measured data showed very reasonable agreement, which demonstrated that the developed analysis tool is capable of simulating the vehicle cold room de-icing tests. 940601. Fuzzy logic based-system to control climate in auto- mobile. Nizar Al-Holou and Kashyap H. Shah, University of Detroit. Traditional climate controller process depends upon the estab- lishment of a mathematical model. Expert systems were created to mimic the behavior of a skilled human operator for those processes too complex to be mathematically modeled in real time. Fuzzy logic inference engine use an expert system paradigm for automatic pro- cess control, and have been successful in controlling climate for a vehicle controller. Recently, there have been many practical applica- tions of fuzzy control. Applications of fuzzy control to vehicles become more attractive. In this paper we implemented fuzzy logic based climate controller using software development tool (MATLAB). 940602. Automotive climate control in passenger compart- ment with external thermal irradiation. J.-G. Lee, CFD Research Corp.; and M. Sioshansi, Chrysler Corp. This work is a joint development project between Chrysler and CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC). The objective of this investi- gation is to perform a 3D computational heat transfer analysis in a vehicle passenger compartment, for better climate control, under external thermal radiation. One of the major tasks is to simulate the transient temperature variation in the passenger compartment after the AC unit is turned on. Two physical models were incorporated in the computations, namely, the radiation model and the conjugate heat transfer method- ology. The 3D radiation model was employed to evaluate the solar irradiation through the glazed surfaces, namely, the front wind- shield, the rear window, and the two side windows. Conjugate heat transfer methodology was employed to compute the heat transfer across the glazed surfaces due to heat conduction and convection. These developed models were then integrated and incorporated into the CFD-ACE code, a multi-domain, 2P and 3D combined general equations solver developed by CFDRC. Comparison shows very reasonable agreement between compu- tational results and experimental data obtained from vehicle hot room cool down tests. This study demonstrates that Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology can be used as a design and pro- totyping tool for automotive climate control systems. 940603.

A numerical simulation program for the design of the cooling air duct and the cooling system of vehicles for stationary operating con- ditions is introduced. This program allows the simulation of interac- tions with the system environment resp. an air conditioning. Hot recirculations of air in the front part of the car and the inhomoge- neous flow through the heat exchangers radiator and condenser in their affects on the heat transfer capacity are simulated. The power demand of the fan, the water pump and the compressor is taken into account for calculating the heat flow from the engine into the cool- ing water. 940604. Visualization of vehicle sound quality using human hearing model. Toshihiro Wakita, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc. The purpose of this study is to develop a method for analysis and evaluation of vehicle sound quality that replicates the human hear- ing sense. First, a method for analysis using a human hearing model was developed, and the results of the analysis were expressed as an image. Second, a method for objective evaluations of vehicle sound quality was developed, based on subjective evaluation tests, and the evaluation result was expressed as an image and number. These results reflect the properties of human hearing, enabling intuitive recognition of vehicle sound quality. Therefore, this is applicable to sound quality comparison and interior sound quality design. 940606. A study on active noise control using the half scaled compartment cavity model. W. G. Lee, S. K. Park, and M. W. Suh, Kia Motors Corp. A study on ANC system to reduce the noise level inside a half- scaled-compartment-cavity-model was carried out. Numerical anal- yses were performed to find the acoustic resonance modes of the 74</page><page sequence="74">940606-940613 cavity model and to select the proper locations of the control sources inside the cavity having the noise sources. The amplitudes and the phases of control sources at fixed positions were calculated for the ANC system to reduce the acoustic potential energy of some spe- cific points inside the cavity. The results of the experiments using the half-scaled- compartment-model to verify those of the numerical simulation were shown. These results showed the possibility to develop ANC system making use of the current loudspeakers in car audio system without any change of layout and additional control speakers. 940607. The effect of engine mounts on the noise and vibra- tion behavior of vehicles. Michael Muller and Uwe Weltin, Carl Freudenberg; and Delbert Law, Mark M. Roberts, and Thomas W. Siebler, Freudenberg-NOK. The noise and ride behavior of a vehicle can be significantly affected by vibrations transferred from the engine through the engine mounts to the chassis. Considering the engine, engine mounts, and chassis as individual components limits the potential gains on the overall vehicle performance. By describing the engine, engine mounts, and chassis as a vibrational system, emphasis can be placed on the capacity for engine mounts to improve the vibra- tional characteristics of a vehicle. The focus of this paper is on the role of engine mounts in the optimization process of vehicle vibrational and acoustic behavior. Passive, semi-active, and fully active engine mount designs are dis- cussed. Characterization of the different effects of these types of mounts on noise and vibration performance is provided based upon analytical and experimental results. 940608. High performance active noise control system for engine noise in a car cabin. Hiroshi Uchida, Norihiko Nakao, and Tetsuro Butsuen, Mazda Motor Corp. A very effective and practical technique for active control of engine noise in a car cabin has been developed. By utilizing the repetitiveness of the engine noise and introducing the idea of error scanning, a new control algorithm was developed that requires only 30-50% of the arithmetic operations of the filtered-x least mean square method. A system with only 3 microphones allocated on the basis of the spatial distribution of the noise is able to make the whole cabin space quiet. Experimental results show that a maximum noise attenuation of 8dB(A) has been achieved at each seat position. 940609. Vehicle interior noise prediction using sound inten- sity measurement. Haruki Saito and Toru Mori, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Center, Ltd. Demand for more accuracy in prediction and analysis of noise and vibration characteristics is increasing. Prediction and analysis are essential to the vehicle development process. However, in the case of vehicle body vibration due to forces applied at the engine over a wide frequency range, accurate prediction and analysis are difficult to achieve using conventional numerical and experimental modal analysis methods. The vehicle body typically has high modal density and high damping levels. Also, using the results of interior panel vibration measurements in a vehicle model, enormous amounts of time are required to measure on each panel in the passen- ger compartment. In this study, a new method has been developed, in which spa- tially averaged vibration velocity, determined from sound intensity measured on each panel, was combined with the results of numerical analysis of interior sound field. Time required for testing was reduced by using spatially averaged sound intensity. In addition, accuracy was maintained by incorporating the phase difference between vibrating panels. By using this method, interior noise levels largely due to the engine vibration were predicted and vehicle body panel contribu- tions are analyzed. The frequency range of interest is from 150 to 500Hz, which has the greatest contribution to sound quality in a vehicle. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940611. Vibration damping rubber/metal elements for auto- motive applications. Klaus- Peter Zeyen, General Tire, Inc. The demands expected of a modern state-of-the-art car with regard to optimum quality are constantly increasing. In addition to safety and travelling convenience, the noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) characteristics are increasingly important considerations when purchasing a car. This has been confirmed in the past by the steady growth of the market share held by Japanese cars, also as a result of this aspect, for instance the LEXUS top model from Toyota which incorporates dampers (rubber-metal vibration absorbing elements) for utmost travelling smoothness and acknowledged luxurious riding comfort. However, be warned in this context: The Japanese designer elim- inates vibrations in a slightly different manner. The problem is rec- ognized beforehand and tackled by ensuring that vibration damping, through corresponding car internal masses, forms an integral part of the car during the design stage. This calls for a different approach in the design departments as the car can no longer be considered solely under the aspect of rigid- ity and safety, but also from the standpoint of its dynamic, vibration technical characteristics. This paper aims at drawing attention to this aspect on the basis of authentic and practical examples from the automobile industry. To arouse the interest of both the vibration spe- cialist from the NVH department as well as the designer, the paper will also cover fundamental aspects of vibrations, as well as the car and man as vibration systems. 940612. Theoretical, computational and experimental inves- tigation of helmholtz resonators: one-dimensional versus multi- dimensional approach. A. Se lamet, N. S. Dickey, and P. M. Radavich, Universit y of Michigan; and J. M. Novak, Ford Motor Co. Helmholtz resonators are widely used for the noise reduction in vehicle induction and exhaust systems. This study investigates the effect of specific cavity dimensions of these resonators theoretically, computationally and experimentally. By considering one- dimensional wave propagation through distributed masses in the connector and cavity, a closed-form expression for the transmission loss of axisymmetric configurations is presented, thereby partially eliminating the limitations of a lumped-parameter analysis. Eight resonators of fixed neck geometry and cavity volume with length-to- diameter ratios of the volume varying from 0.32 to 23.92 are studied both computationally and experimentally. The first of the two com- putational approaches employed in the study implements a finite dif- ference time domain technique to solve the nonlinear governing equations of one-dimensional compressible flow. It is shown that individual volume dimensions may have a considerable effect on resonator performance, particularly in reducing the primary reso- nance frequency compared to the classical result. The second com- putational approach investigates the effects of multi-dimensional physics by solving the three-dimensional wave equation with a boundary element method and comparing the results with those of the one-dimensional treatments. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940613. Development of high performance exhaust mount- ings. Masaaki Hamada, Tokai Rubber Industries, Ltd. The rubber mountings used to support the exhaust piping in auto- mobiles also play important roles in isolating the cabin of the vehi- cle from the exhaust pipe vibrations. Through our evaluation on the characteristics and mechanism of vibration transmission behavior of the rubber mountings, it was confirmed that dynamic stiffness of the rubber mounting increases at specific frequency ranges, and thereby increases the vibration transmission to the cabin in those frequen- cies. It was identified by both Modal and FEM analyses of the rub- ber mounting structure that this phenomenon of increase in dynamic 75</page><page sequence="75">940613-940620 stiffness is induced by resonance modes of the rubber which inher- ently accompanies the structure of conventional rubber mounting designs. Sensitivity analysis of the vehicle body at the installation points of the rubber exhaust mountings in the piping line, confirmed that frequencies of high sensitivity zones coincide or are near the resonance frequencies of the rubber mounting. This is assumed to be a big factor to worsen the noise and vibration in the cabin from the exhaust pipes. Through careful study of the modes of the rubber resonance phenomenon, a new structure design for rubber exhaust mountings has been developed. Characteristic tests and vehicle eval- uations confirmed that the new design mountings can successfully suppress the inherent resonance modes of the rubber mounting in the problem frequencies, and subsequently reduce vehicle vibration and noise when installed. 940614. Effect of resonator location on resonator effective- ness using NASTRAN mode shape prediction analysis and LAMPS acoustic model. John D. Ko stun and J. S. Lin, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes a CAE methodology for optimizing the per- formance of induction system resonators on the basis of their loca- tion within the standing wave modes of the system. An acoustic modal analysis utility of NASTRAN, and a duct system acoustics model, LAMPS, are used interactively to determine resonator loca- tion and resonator size requirement. The NASTRAN code predicts the standing wave mode shapes for the resonant frequencies of the induction system which includes the air inlet system and the intake manifold. Resonator location is determined on the basis of the pres- sure anti-nodal points of the mode shapes. Maximum attenuation is achieved at or near the anti- nodal points and minimal attenuation at the nodal points. The LAMPS code is used to predict the acoustic response characteristics of the system with and without resonators. Induction noise measurements made on an operating engine agree fairly well with the computer predicted results. 940615. Carbon-and glass-fiber knits for thermoplastic com- posites in cars. J. Mayer, S.-W. Ha, K. Ruffieux, R. Tognini, B. Koch, and E. Wintermantel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. Knitted high performance fibers as reinforcement are interesting for loaded parts, due to their drapability and the possibility of waste free near net shape production methods. Additionally, a consider- able advantage is seen in the coherence of the knit structure, which prevents uncontrolled fiber flow during thermoforming processes and allows strain hardening and strain stiffening during controlled drawing. Compared to common composite manufacturing pro- cesses, this may lower costs. The knit structure allows an adjustable anisotropy of the mechan- ical composite-properties due to its drawability. It has been shown that the rate of drawing and the mechanical anisotropy have a linear correlation. Specific weakening of the fiber- matrix interface revealed a dependence of fiber-matrix adhesion on the failure behavior. Two advantageous manufacturing techniques for advanced com- posite processing were studied for knitted fiber reinforced thermo- plastics: net-shape pressing and organo sheet deep drawing. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940616. A parametric study of laminated composite shells with environmental effects, using a higher-order FE model. A. M. M. Jayasuriya, S. N. Dwivedi, N. T. Sivaneri, and Don Lyons, West Virginia Univ. In this study a higher-order shear deformable, analytical model is developed to analyze composite shells with parametric modeling capabilities. The material and geometric properties and loading con- ditions can be varied as parameters which satisfy a set of constraints to allow the designer to achieve a sensible and computationally fea- sible FD model. The formulation is derived with equal emphasis on all the six strains as well as stress components at a generic point in the shell laminate. Unlike many other available models which vio- lates the equilibrium conditions at lamina interfaces, this model sat- isfies the equilibrium conditions at the lamina interfaces for a certain class (angle-ply and unidirectional orthotopic) of laminates. This model also can calculate the through-thickness stress distribution very accurately, thereby allowing the design or material processing engineer to have a better understanding about all the components of residual stresses at surface and within the shell laminate. An existing micromechanics model is integrated into the present model to deter- mine the material degradation due to environmental effects such as high moisture absorption and heat conduction. The residual stresses caused by the changes in environment are also included in the analy- sis. A parametric study is conducted to study the structural response due to changes in geometry, ply set-up and environmental effects. 940617. An elasticity solution of angle-ply laminated compos- ite shells based on a higher-order FE analysis. A. M. M. Jaya- suriya, S. N. Dwivedi, N. T. Sivaneri, and Don Lyons, West Virginia Univ. In the case of advanced light weight material applications, the design of such components, in many cases, are based on applied sur- face tractions. These surface loads can be caused by various means. When wind effects are present these traction can be due to pressure, suction or drag. In the case of underwater applications, hydrostatic pressure and friction caused by moving against water current needs to be considered in the design. These are some of the traction load applications, a design engineer has to deal with in his advanced material applications. In contrast to the conventional materials, the modern structures made of highly directional dependent material properties, respond the applied loads and environment in an unpre- dicted way, so that, a detail analysis and design is always necessary. Hence in the present study a higher-order shear deformation formu- lation is developed to calculate the distribution of stresses accurately in angle-ply laminated shells of revolution. In this work the state of strain and stress at any point in the shell laminate are treated without any assumptions in the displacement fields in any direction. A Lagrange multiplier constraints are introduced into the formulations to enforce the surface traction conditions. The calculated displace- ments and stress distributions can be used to study the material fail- ure, interface stresses and delamination, etc. This analytical proce- dure also becomes very useful in the cases where more attention is needed in the properties in the thickness direction of the laminate. A set of numerical examples are given using the FEM based on derived formulation. 940619. An integrated variable-curvature laminated compos- ite shell analysis module for impact loading and excessive hygro- thermal effects. A. M. M. Jayasuriya, S. N. Dwivedi, N. T. Sivaneri, and Don Lyons, West Virginia Univ. The composite laminated shell structures such as tubes, pipes, cylinders, spherical, conical and variable curvature parts can be seen in many advanced engineering applications. Among them, many are exposed to liquids, vapor, and high and low temperature gradients and subjected to various external loads. Therefore it is important to analyze and study performance of these shell components under such environmental and loading conditions with a more diverse ana- lytical tool. In this study an integrated computer module based on the FEM is developed for the analysis and design of laminated com- posite shells with variable curvatures. The laminates can be made of general shells of revolution and can be subjected to uniform or axisymmetric line-impact loadings, or uniform or linearly varying ring-impact loadings. The hygroscopic and thermal expansions as well as material degradation due to moisture absorption and heat are included into this integrated computer module. 940620. Rationalization of processing conditions for gas injection molding. Christopher L. Clark and Rick Williams, GE Plastics. 76</page><page sequence="76">940620-940627 The gas injection molding process created a great deal of interest when it was first introduced, especially on the part of the automotive plastics industry. The process allows injection molders to make larger parts with increased rigidity at lower clamping pressures. This, in turn, allows parts to be molded that have not previously been able to be created. However, the process has been hampered by problems. First and foremost have been the numerous patent infringement suits and licensing difficulties that have retarded the spread of the technology in the United States. Second, technological problems - such as con- trolling the seemingly erratic nature of the gas - have also been an issue. As with any new molding technology, the plastics industry is still attempting to establish logical techniques to set up and rational- ize processing conditions for the method. Although the gas equip- ment allows a great deal of adjustments to be made, there is an opti- mum processing window-providing control and repeatability of the process- that needs to be established in order to make consistent, acceptable parts. The purpose of this paper is to describe one set of rationalization techniques for the emerging gas injection technology that is applica- ble regardless of the type of machine or processing license a molder is using. This technique makes use of an in-line pressure transducer and one or more in-mold pressure transducers to determine the actual gas injection pressure and, therefore, flow rates to optimize processing. The technique allows the comparison of input process conditions versus actual changes that affect the resultant part. The discussions will not be specific to any particular machine or mate- rial. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940621. Advances in polypropylene for automotive blow molding. James R. Beren and Cathleen Capellman, Himont U.S.A. Himont has developed a technology that dramatically improves the melt strength characteristics of polypropylene. This technology has been applied to the generation of polypropylene grades designed specifically for large part blow molding. Compared to conventional polypropylene, these materials exhibit less parison sag and more uniform stretching, which can lead to improved part uniformity and the potential to downgauge. In addition, inherent to the high melt strength polypropylene is improved heat resistance and a better stiff- ness/impact balance as compared to its conventional polypropylene counterparts. The improved processability and physical property balance have made high melt strength polypropylene ideal for blow molding of seat backs, resonators, and many other automotive com- ponents. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940622. Electromagnetic welding of thermoplastics and spe- cific design criteria. Micheal H. Topping, Ashland Chemical Inc. Electromagnetic (EMA) bonding of thermoplastics provides a simple, rapid and reliable assembly technique to produce structural, hermetic or high pressure seals on most thermoplastic materials. It employs the basic principles of induction heating by developing fusion temperature at the abutting interface of parts to be welded using a thermoplastic electromagnetic interlayer. The process is so versatile it can weld almost any thermoplastic, filled or unfilled, to itself plus certain dissimilar thermoplastics and non-thermoplastic materials, such as paper to thermoplastics. The EMA process can easily weld engineering, high performance resins and such difficult-to-weld materials as polyolefins and nylons. Understanding the design criteria for the electromagnetic bond- ing is essential to the new product designer. It involves an under- standing of the process itself, the work coil designs, and the joint designs. The purpose of this paper is to relate some of these funda- mentals and apply them to specific applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940623.

This paper discusses the design issues related to bolted joints in automotive composites. Pin bearing strength and fatigue test results of bolted joints in both random fiber as well as continuous fiber sheet molding compound composites are reviewed. Fatigue failure modes in bolted joints of these composites are presented. Based on these tests, design guidelines for bolted joints in sheet molding com- pound composites are proposed. 940624. (SP- 101 3) Electronic crash sensing unit for airbag. Junji Kanamoto, Masahiro Miyamori, Kazunori J inno, and Manabu Hirao, NEC Home Electronics, Ltd. This paper describes an electronic crash sensing unit which uses a semi-conductive accelerometer for implementing a single point sensing system. This electronic sensing unit uses a new crash recog- nition mechanism utilizing two-dimensional discrimination func- tion. A new crash recognition mechanism is capable of providing reli- able crash recognition in high speed crashes, as well as reliable per- formance in non-deployment situations. This paper also discusses the evaluation procedures which com- pare recognition processing time and the robustness of the scheme. 940625. (SP- 101 3) Hot wire mass gas flow sensing device. Masatoshi Sugiura, Hitachi Farmington Hills Technical Center, Inc.; Isao Okazaki, Hitachi Automotive Products, Inc.; and George Saikalis, Hitachi America, Ltd. The key issue in gas metering of alternative fuel vehicle is to obtain low emission and accurate air-fuel ratio. A hot wire mass air flow sensor can directly monitor the air flow by using thermal trans- fer amount in an unit time to keep the hot wire at a certain tempera- ture. Surveys were conducted regarding this method and it was veri- fied that this method enables to monitor mass gas flow in applica- tions such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and propane (C3H8). The gas passage body for this sensor, which consists of a 10mm diameter bypass and a main pass has been surveyed and developed. This electrical sensing device for CNG has been completed and its performance was verified with a CNG flow test stand and a CNG engine. We have found that this thermal transfer monitoring method is not affected by a pressure change. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940626. (SP- 101 3) Study on hot wire sensor characteristics under high pressure gaseous operation. George Saikalis, Hitachi America, Ltd.; and Masatoshi Sugiura, Hitachi Farmington Hills Technical Center. A new gas flow sensor was derived from the current air flow sensing technology. This sensor is targeted at measuring the amount of gaseous mass flow under high pressure and with varying gas tem- perature. Thermodynamical properties of CH4, air, N2He and CO2 have been complied at different pressures and temperatures. This infor- mation is required for the simulation. A theoretical model has been developed to analyze the behavior of the sensor circuit with different gases at varying pressure and temperature. The theoretical model encompasses a model of the gas flow circuit as well as a flow model with an optimized fluid dynamic equation. Fluid dynamics have also been studied to demonstrate the usage of a bypass and a mesh screen for flow regulation. A finite element analysis (FEA) is also generated to study the velocity profile and potential turbulence areas. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940627. (SP- 101 3) Diagnostics and communications in vehicle control systems using smart power ICs. Randall Wollschlager, Keith M. Wellnitz, and Randy Frank, Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector. The increasing complexity in automotive systems is resulting in the need for more extensive diagnostics and protection, especially at the output (high stress) portion of the system. These diagnostics 77</page><page sequence="77">940627-940634 are inputs to the vehicle control system which can provide an imme- diate indication to the driver of the need for servicing and store information for subsequent interrogation by service diagnostic equipment. This paper will present techniques for fault protection, diagnosing faults and obtaining bi- directional communication between various vehicle loads and micro-controllers (MCUs) in vehicle electronic systems through the use of power ICs (integrated circuits) with embedded sensors. The power handling capability of these devices combined with integrated circuit design allows con- siderable simplification of printed circuit board layout and reduction in electronic module size, while providing the possibility of sophis- ticated communications with the MCU. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940628. (SP- 101 3) A universal and cost-effective fuel gauge sensor based on wave propagation effect in sold metal roads. Erich Zabler, Anton Dukart, Nicolas Grein, and Frieder Heintz, Robert Bosch GmbH. In recognition of safety considerations, modern fuel tanks are fre- quently extremely irregular in shape. This places limits on the appli- cation of conventional Potentiometrie sensors. Required are more universal sensors without mechanically-moving parts. These sen- sors should also be characterized by especially good resolution and precision in the residual-quantity range, that is, the zero point preci- sion should be of a high order. One type of metal rod can be bent into any of a variety of shapes to provide an effective means of monitoring the fuel level. In this metal rod, the propagation characteristics of a certain type of sound wave, known as bending waves, display major variations according to the level of the surrounding medium. The waves spread more rap- idly through the exposed section of the rod than through the area which remains submerged. Thus the rod's characteristic oscillation frequency varies as a function of immersion depth. For electric pro- cessing, electromagnetic excitation is employed to induce ultrasonic oscillations in the rod. The phase at the exposed end of the road is regulated to a constant value in order to maintain the rod at a charac- teristic natural frequency corresponding to the instantaneous fuel level. It is possible to maintain temperature-induced fluctuations in both zero-point stability and sensitivity at minimal levels through careful selection of suitable rod material and an appropriate operat- ing frequency. Suitable profiles can be employed to optimize other operating parameters and adapt the sensor for use with specific mea- surement ranges. The present treatise reports on the basic principles of the process - the theory of which is simple to describe and simulate - as well as initial research results. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940629. (SP- 101 3) A non contact strain gage torque sensor for automotive servo driven steering systems. Erich Zabler, Frieder Heintz, Anton Dukart, and Peter Krott, Robert Bosch GmbH. Tapping of one or more torques (ranges 10 Nm and 60 Nm) on the steering column for the purpose of servo control must satisfy high accuracy requirements on the one hand and high safety require- ments on the other hand. A suggestion for developing a low-cost solution to this problem is described below. Strain gages optimally satisfy both thee requirements. However, for cost reasons, these are not applied directly to the steering column but to a prefabricated, flat steel rod which is laser welded to the torque rod of the steering col- umn. The measuring direction of the strain gages is under 45° to the steering column axis. The strain gages are either vacuum metallized onto the support road as a thin film or laminated in a particularly low-cost way by means of a foil-type intermediate carrier. The relatively low output signals of the measuring resistor bridge are amplified on site (on the steering column) with an integrated electronic evaluation circuit and converted into a frequency-analog, highly interference-proof signal. Signal output and power supply may be connected to the fixed parts of the body neither by collector rings nor by cables. Both connections are made totally non-contact by means of a very simple and low-cost rotary transformer which surrounds the steering column concentrically and has two separate winding chambers. In this case, it is practically impossible for air gap fluctuations and similar interferences to falsify the frequency- analog measuring signal. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940630. (SP- 101 3) Modeling and experimental validation of torsional crankshaft dynamics. Georg F. Mauer, University of Nevada. Crankshafts are subjected to complex forces and torques which vary continuously with location and time. A nonlinear crankshaft dynamics model is developed on the basis of a dynamic simulation language. The model comprises compression and combustion forces, dynamics of oscillating parts, spatially distributed inertial and elastic effects on the crankshaft, and dissipative effects. The model is validated through experimental records of crankshaft tor- sional dynamics on an eight-cylinder diesel engine, comprising wide ranges of engine torsional loads and speeds. The analysis of crank- shaft dynamics allows to determine the computational requirements for the determination of the instantaneous engine torque. Such instantaneous torque measurement is of interest for improved per- formance and emission control. 940631. (SP- 101 3) High precision angular position sensor. Shigeru Kato and Jun-ichi Nakaho, Tokai Rika Co., Ltd. The authors have developed an angular position sensor which outputs an analog voltage in accordance with the angular position of rotation. The sensor detects the absolute angular positions of rota- tion and offers high precision along with high durability. The sensor detects the angular positions by means of optical detection of the rel- ative distance between a spiral slit and a circular slit, which both have a coaxial center and are transparent. The nonlinearity of this sensor is less than ±0.5% and the detection range of the angular position is more than 355°. The operating temperature range is -30°C to +80°C, with a thermal drift within Io at the center of the detection range. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940632.

A SOI type pressure sensor has been developed which can mea- sure pressure at high temperature environments above 150°C. SOI stands for Silicon On Insulator. A single-crystalline silicon layer is located on an insulating layer formed on a silicon substrate. The piezoresistors of the SOI type pressure sensor are made from the single-crystalline silicon layer which is isolated from the silicon substrate by the insulating layer. There is no leakage current from 78</page><page sequence="78">940634-940641 the piezoresistors. The SOI structure is made by the laser- recrystallization-method.

(SP- 101 3) An improved temperature sensing system for diesel engine applications. Eric B. Andrews, Cummins Elec- tronics Co.; and Dipchand V. Nishar, Cummins Engine Co. Thermistors are used for temperature measurement in the auto- motive industry because of their low cost, reliability and sensitivity to small changes in temperature. The thermistor resistance is a non- linear function of the measured temperature. Normally, a bias resis- tance is used to linearize the thermistor characteristics. Unfortu- nately, this leads to reduced resolution at the low and high end of the temperature range. In this paper, a novel design scheme is pro- posed in which comparator-based logic is used to select one of four bias resistors. The resistor selected depends upon the magnitude of the temperature being measured. This approach provides improved resolution (and consequently improves the overall measurement accuracy) while requiring lesser memory and execution time than existing schemes. The proposed approach also improves the ability to diagnose open and short circuits as well as sensor faults. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940636. (SP- 1033) Improved projector headlamps using HID (litronic) and incandescent bulbs. Rainer Neuman, Robert Bosch Corp. A new automotive headlamp has been developed under the des- ignation LITRONIC (Light Electronics). In order to improve the light quality and to increase driver safety on the road, a gas- discharge lamp was chosen as the light source instead of the conven- tional incandescent bulb. The projector headlamp is well-suited for the application of the LITRONIC system. Especially in the US market, there is currently a potential interest in applying projector headlamps in series produc- tion. Compared to conventional headlamps, advantages can be seen in the flexibility of this kind of headlamp from the styling viewpoint. In this paper, newly developed solutions for projector headlamps for Bosch will be presented, for HID as well as for incandescent bulbs. Applications for low beam and for high beam are included. By means of concrete examples, the improvements in light quality compared to conventional systems will be demonstrated. And the boundary conditions in relation to styling aspects (high vertical inclination of the outer lens, lens diameter, overall system length) are taken into account and will be discussed. It will be shown that the projector headlamp system can be ide- ally applied to result in an improved US-light pattern, thus contrib- uting to safety in night-time driving. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940637. (SP- 1033) Development of smoothly curved inner lens. M. Ishikawa, Y. Ohtsuka, M. Maeda, S. Igarashi, and K. Mochizuki, Kioto Manufacturing Co., Ltd. This report details our development of a smoothly curved inner lens for use in automotive signalling lamps, such a lens allows for greater freedom at the design stage of an automobile, and it can be useful for economizing on space. Until recently, however, the design of such lenses has been in dif- ficulty due to the complex geometries involved, and the appearance and light distribution has often turned out to be inferior to that of conventional plane and spherical lenses. The main reason for this is that in the case of these conventional lenses, optical calculations can be reduced to simple equations, but this is generally not possible with smoothly curved lenses. Our goal has been to develop a smoothly curved inner lens whose optical characteristics could be calculated and verified. This devel- opment project can be divided into three stages: design, processing, and evaluation. We are currently developing the third stage. This report explains the procedure by which the surface characteristics of the lens are calculated, and offers some concrete examples of this procedure applied. 940638.

(SP- 1033) Headlight beam pattern evaluation - Customer to engineer to customer. Daniel D. Jack, Stephen M. O' Day, and Vivek D. Bhise, E ord Motor Co. A method for communication linking the vehicle user and the lighting engineer has been developed to improve the headlight beam patten development process. A technique called the semantic differ- ential has been used to quantify the user's perception on a large number of attributes of the beam pattern. The basis of the technique utilizes descriptive words used by both drivers and engineers to characterize headlight beam patterns. Beam pattern evaluations con- ducted in a series of dynamic drive situations formed the initial data base. Subsequent evaluations using this technique have facilitated close and quick interaction between the customer and the engineer during the development of headlight beam patterns. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940640. (SP- 1033) The relative importance of horizontal and vertical aim of low- beam headlamps. Michael Sivak, Michael J. Elannagan, and Takashi Sato, University of Michigan. This study evaluated the relative effects of horizontal and vertical misaim of low-beam headlamps. The approach involved analyzing light-output matrices of 150 production low beams, manufactured for sale in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. The specific analysis involved computing, for 225 locations in the central part of each beam pattern, the ratios of nominal intensity and intensity for verti- cal and horizontal misaim of up to 1.5°. The ratios greater than 1 log unit were considered to be of practical significance in terms of changes in visual performance and discomfort glare, and those greater than 0.5 log unit of likely significance. Only changes relative to visual performance and glare under nominal aim were considered; absolute levels were not examined. Furthermore, simultaneous hori- zontal and vertical misaims were not considered. The results indicate that horizontal misaim of the U.S., European, and Japanese lamps up to 1.5° in either direction is unlikely to be of practical significance. For the U.S. lamps, vertical misaim is of practical significance when misaim reaches 1.5°, and is of likely sig- nificance at misaim of Io. For the European lamps and the Japanese lamps of the European type, vertical misaim of 1 ° is of practical sig- nificance, and misaim of 0.5° is of likely significance. For the Japa- nese lamps of the U.S. type, vertical misaim of even 1.5° is unlikely to be of practical significance; likely significance is reached at 0.5° of misaim. The present findings imply that photometric standards for low beams should include less strict tolerance limits for horizontal aim than for vertical aim. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940641. (SP- 1033) Quantifying the benefits of variable reflec- tance rearview mirrors. Michael J. Elannagan and Michael Sivak, University of Michigan. We collected photometric data, concerning the simultaneous levels of rearview mirror glare and luminance of the forward scene, in order to characterize the night driving environment of rearview mirrors. An instrumented vehicle was used to collect photometric data for each combinations of three road types (urban, expressway, and rural) with two pavement conditions (dry and wet). We then 79</page><page sequence="79">940641-940646 used these data to quantify the benefits of variable-reflectance rear- view mirrors relative to: (1) fixed- reflectance mirrors, and (2) two- level prism mirrors. The performance of the various types of mirrors was quantified in terms of a figure of merit. The figure of merit is simply the percentage of the time that all of three mirror- performance measures are met: (1) discomfort glare, (2) forward visibility, and (3) rearward visibility. Results of the model indicate that variable reflectance mirrors offer substantial improvements, both as replacements for prism mir- rors in the center mirror position, and, additionally, as replacements for fixed reflectance driver-side mirrors. The advantages are present in approximately equal magnitudes for most combinations of road type and pavement condition. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940642. (SP- 1033) Side mirror quality improvement - Design philosophy and computer aided engineering approach. Gajanan V. Gandhe and V. Sural, EASi Engineering; Todd Pastrick, Don- nelly Corp.; and Keith Hoelscher, Ford Motor Co. Side mirror design optimization has been traditionally accom- plished using an iterative design and testing process, often resulting in considerable cost in retooling operations, and causing significant delays in production. The ever increasing demand for high quality products has led major automotive companies to set high perfor- mance standards for side mirrors. These include structural, vibra- tion, and aesthetic criteria, which affect the functionality and appearance of the mirror. The first two issues have been successfully addressed here using a fundamental design philosophy and a com- puter aided engineering approach. This approach has helped improve product quality, reduce the costs associated with redesign and retooling and minimize the development cycle time from con- cept to production. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940643.

(SP- 1033) Advanced indication of braking: a practi- cal safety measure for improvement of decision-reaction time for avoidance of rear- end collisions. Reuven Koter, Baran Group Ltd. The objective of this paper is to show that an Advance Brake- lights Warning System (ABWS) device improves the detection- reaction time for avoidance of rear-end collisions and to recommend its installation. In the United States, acordig to National Accident Sampling Sys- tem Data, rear-end collisions constitute approximately 25 percent of all multi-vehicle accidents (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1992). Therefore it is not surprising that over the past 25 years much research has been devoted to evaluating alterna- tive vehicle rear lighting, signaling, and brake systems that would enhance their conspicuousness and visibility, thus inducing quicker accident avoidance maneuvers from following drivers. This line of research culminated in the development, evaluation, demonstration of effectiveness, and finally, implementation of the Center High- Mounted Stop Light (CHMSL) as part of the mandatory US Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108. But the quest to find the ultimate response to the problem of rear- end crash consequences did not end and will probably never end. The newly emerging IVHS project is an example of the continued search for safety solutions. The overriding goal is to improve driv- ers' ability to process the collision-avoidance- perception-detection response to about-to-stop vehicles. Because the most recent and sophisticated approach to the problem is based on the assumption of differential human behavior for abrupt versus regular braking, an alternative approach consists of developing Advance Brakelights Warning Systems (ABWS). This paper shows that such a system provides the optimal solution available today to rear-end collisions caused by tailgating, in terms of cost/performance/public acceptabil- ity ratio. The Advance Brakelights Warning System (ABWS) provides an anticipatory activation of vehicle signaling lights in response to the detection of the driver's intention to brake. Another attractive fea- ture of ABWS is that while its operation is indistinguishable from actual emergency braking, it precedes it by approximately a quarter of a second. The implementation of this approach is embodied in the ABWS anticipatory activation devices providing following drivers with an early warning coupled with improved perception-detection of the leading vehicle's imminent braking. What makes the ABWS device unique is its simplicity, ease of installation, After-Market (Do-It- Yourself) and OEM adaptability, non-interference with the car's human engineering, its low cost and availability. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940645.

There have been many attempts to improve rear vision for drivers of passenger vehicles, including but not limited to the following: Periscope mirrors, - Fiber optics - Fresnel Lenses - variable radius mirrors, which are used to some extent in Europe but have not been approved in the United States - Electronic devices such as TV cam- era/monitor - infrared, mini- radar - photo cells and video micro chips. Many of these devices depend on electrical power to even be operational, and all of these devices have proved to be expensive as well as impractical and don't hold any promise for the near-term future. 940646. Instrument panel coatings to reduce veiling glare and for decorative effects. Charles D. Storms, Red Spot Paint &amp; Varnish Co., Inc. Veiling glare causes vision safety problems particularly with low windshield angles. Ultra- Suede® coatings contain spherical, beaded pigments to produce low gloss, mar resistant coatings found to sig- nificantly reduce veiling glare in car and truck upper instrument close-out panel applications. The soft, lustrous feel and polychromatic look offer unique deco- rative styling effects. Low gloss and mar resistance are generally competing properties. The use of flexible spherical pigments and flexible binders/resins meets the long sought after requirement. The reduction in veiling glare property of the suede-like coating was studied by University of Detroit Mercy and builds on the research done by Chrysler and University of Detroit Mercy pres- ented in the 1992 SAE paper 920105. The conclusions reached in this new work presented in this paper are: 1) the suede-like coating reduces veiling glare more than other flat paint. Suede-lie coating samples proved significantly more effective in glare reduction as measured by both the number of per- ceived errors and discomfort ratings than other paints tested; i.e. waterborne at 4° gloss and Munsell matte finishes; 2) the suede-like coating is more effective than in-mold texture. No significant differ- ences in errors or discomfort were noted as a function of surface tex- ture; i.e., molded in texture. Paint type is the independent variable primarily influencing subjective glare effects with surface texture yielding minimal effects; and 3) the suede-like coating can be used in lighter colors than other paints. Matte finishes are only effective up to Munsell Color 3 while the suede-like coating is effective up to Munsell Color 7 (0 = Black and 10 = White). 80</page><page sequence="80">940647-940653 940647. Improved heat and light stability of vacuum form- able PVC alloys for automotive interior trim applications. Gregory • B. Ratlief, O 'Sullivan Corp. An improved PVC alloy with a soft feel that is vacuum formable has been developed for better durability in heat and light. This sheet is intended for automotive interior trim applications that utilize a PVC alloy coverstock backed with a pour-in-place polyurethane foam. Accelerated heat (oven aging 120°C) and light (Xenon Arc) aging show this material to have excellent durability characteristics. This new material contains no cadmium-based pigments or stabiliz- ers. It has been designed to help meet the automotive industry's desire to reach a 5- and 10-year life with the economical benefits of a thermoforming process. 940648. Improved heat age staining properties of PVC slush power vinyl. Jospeh T. Donatti and Robert P. Cavender, United Technologies Automotive. Since 1988, significant progress has been made improving the color stability of polyvinyl chloride slush vinyl. This has been accomplished by utilizing an optimum combination of non- cadmium Perchlorate salt stabilizers. Color stability of such vinyl has been improved from the standard 168 hours at 100°C to 336 hours at 122°C and in some cases depending upon color exceeding 336 hours duration. New developments are underway at United Technologies Automotive based on a second generation of new non- cadmium Perchlorate salt stabilizers. This new technology has lead to significant improvements where specific colors have surpassed 500 hours at 122°C. Although this new development is incomplete, at this time, it does indicate that further improvements can be made with new generation stabilizers and with continued assistance from the polyurethane suppliers and catalyst manufacturers. 940649. New material for supplemental inflatable restraint doors. Robert C. Bondar, James D Hass, and James E. Shrewsburg, BASF Corp. New specialty urethane foams have been developed for use in composite type air bag doors (doors which consist of a vinyl skin, a foamed urethane core, and a supporting substrate). These air bag door foams are characterized by: high strength and tear resistance (much greater than typical instrument panel [IP] foam); good low and high temperature physical properties (required for varied deployment conditions); excellent heat aged physical properties (required for long life in vehicle service); and low vinyl staining rivaling good IP foam. Detailed descriptions of the air bag door foam physical properties are presented along with recent developments. 940650. Automotive interior system harmony. John A. Gard- ner and John A. Grimes, Davidson Textron. The automotive interior has evolved over the years from a collec- tion of individual components each serving a specific function to an orchestrated trim surround which is serving the dual purpose of functionality and crating a pleasing environment. We can not say we have fully achieved our goal, of a full coordinated interior which displays harmony of appearance and system dimensional integrity, as much more needs to be done. The object of this paper will be to review the past, comment on the present, and discuss a direction toward achieving these illusive goals. Interiors of past vehicles were created to satisfy specific func- tions with appearance being a secondary consideration. There was little effort to coordinate the material, grain, or color for the initial customer and even less concern how these components would co- exist with each other three, five, or ten years later. Recently, the styling studio developed themes which exhibited a coordination effort between major interior components. Fre- quently, however, the theme was poorly executed for a variety of reasons, not only limited as follows: inconsistency due to lack of manufacturing capability; poor subsystem coordination; lack of dimensional management; and unrealistic color expectation. Competitive market pressure has created the need for a homoge- neous interior trim system. This has brought about changes which have heightened the effort to coordinate the interior trim system. Some of these changes are the co-located cross functional program teams, improve dimensional management, continual material improvement, early expectation definition and improved measure- ment of color/gloss, and introduction of new, more predictable man- ufacturing technologies. 940651. The development of gas assist injection molding tech- nology for instrument panel carrier. Yasuo Watanabe and Hiro- fumi Gohda, Idemitsu Petrochemical Co., Ltd.; and Hideki Tajima and Yutaka Enomoto, Nissan Shatai Co., Ltd. Gas Assist Injection Molding technology is becoming a popular new or alternative method for producing various types of automo- tive plastic components. Qualitatively, the benefits of Gas Assist Injection Molding have been thoroughly researched and made known to the public. But, quantitatively, there are only a few appli- cations known to the automotive industry. For our research, we con- structed a Gas Assist Injection Molding set of tooling that was based on the design of a production instrument panel carrier. We compared the Gas Assist Injection Molding component and normal instrument panel carrier with the intent to observe or define the following bene- fits: 1. Reduction of part weight; 2. Enhance the material flow in the mold. 3. Reduce the required press clamp tonnage versus injection molding. 4. Simplification of the mold tooling; and 5. Define the optimum mold conditions for selected candidates of plastic resin to be evaluated in the trials of the instrument panel. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940652. Fully integrated structural instrument panel system. David J. Wiegand, General Motors Corp.; and Richard J. Giba, Dow Chemical Co. The first fully integrated structural instrument panel significantly reduces the cost, weight and part count of a conventional instrument panel. The structural design consists of a cross-car beam/duct, retainer, and knee bolsters. Part integration and consolidation, use of ductile engineering thermoplastics, and the total system design are all contributors to the success of reducing cost and weight. A cost savings of $1.3 million in tooling and $500,000 in manufacturing were achieved with a weight savings of 6.0 pounds per vehicle. The new instrument panel design effectively meets the require- ments of Federal Legislation for occupant protection (FMVSS 208). All parts are molded from the same ductile engineering thermo- plastic, which enhances the potential for economical disassembly and recycling. The fully integrated structural instrument panel system was developed for the 1994 Buick Roadmaster Platform. The system consists of a structural cross-car member, which acts as a cross- car beam and duct, a structural retainer and structural driver, and pas- senger side knee bolsters. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940653. Determination of dimensional changes in injection molded bosses using strain gages: effects on joint durability. Robert V. Hoy, ARCO Chemical Co.; and Christopher J. Bartos, Richard K. Leung, Richard J. Rozmus, and Martin A. Trapp, Ford Motor Co. Improvements in clamp load retention of fastened joints in instrument panels are desired by automotive OEMs to minimize warranty claims due to squeak and rattle problems. The decrease in torque retention of these plastic boss and metal fastener joints over time and temperature cycling was described in a previous SAE tech- nical paper. This loss in clamp load retention (which is another mea- sure of joint durability), as measured by torque, was shown to be affected by differences in the thermal expansion rates of the cap- tured materials. 81</page><page sequence="81">940653-940658 The purpose of this paper is to further quantify these differences by using strain gages to measure the thermal expansion rates and dimensional changes of the joint's various components: metal fas- tener, molded plastic boss, and captured material. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940654. Environmentally friendly instrument panel concepts. Darlene B. Collins, Chrysler Corp. The automobile interior of the 90' s must not only meet the funda- mental design requirements of customer satisfaction through quality and performance but must be designed with the philosophy of recy- clability. Recycle content of the motor vehicle is 75% by weight with the majority of this being steel based components. The remaining 25% is composed of non-metallic materials such as plastics, glass, fibers, foam, dirt, sand and gravel. These materials are often contaminated with automobile fluids and oils which add there own special prob- lems to landfilling. Approximately 9% of this 25% is plastic materi- als of which the bulk is interior components where the largest share is the instrument panel materials. The reclaiming process of automobiles materials requires that the metallic and non-metallic materials be separated and shredded. The secondary metallic industry recovers the shredded metal materials and the non-metallic automobile shredded residue (ASR) is sent to landfilling. The increasing landfill cost, along with the environmen- tal concerns of waste contaminates encourages the search for cost- effective alternatives to landfilling. This paper will discuss environ- mentally safe techniques for usage of materials for design, manufac- turing and reclaiming practices for the instrument panel system. 940655. An evaluation of S/MA instrument panel recyclâtes. Jay S Rosenthal, ARCO Chemical Co. The material issues pertaining to recycling glass reinforced S/MA from instrument panel offal and post consumer instrument panels are addressed in this paper. Values are assessed for the vari- ous types of recyclâtes obtainable from offal and post consumer instrument panels using mechanical separation. Impurity levels and impurity types as well as other factors determining value are dis- cussed in detail. Different instrument panel constructions are evalu- ated including vinyl skin/PU foam variants and TPO skin/XPP foam variants. Recycling thermoplastics from automotive applications is an increasingly important component of both the material's and the part's life cycle. As a major supplier of material for instrument panel (IP) substrates, ARCO Chemical Company (ACC) has recognized its responsibility to is customers and products in this area through the Dylark® Materials Recycling Program. The objective of this program is to develop the materials technology required for recy- cling the styrene/maleic anhydride (S/MA) substrate material back into high value applications like IPs and associated components. The cascade scenario, whereby the recyclate is used in lower perfor- mance applications, is always an option. S/MA materials are already commercially recycled in IPs and related applications, however, this paper will focus on the value of various types of S/MA recyclâtes and how to obtain maximal value if enhancement is needed. The S/MA recyclâtes evaluated in this paper are representative of recyclâtes from IP offal and post consumer IPs. IP offal refers to the material generated in the plant by trimming and related opera- tions. Unlike regrind, offal from IPs is not used as refeed in the injection molding operation because offal generally consists of mul- tiple materials. Instead, IP offal has typically been landfilled which involves a double cost to the manufacturer: landfilling charges and lost material opportunity costs. S/MA recyclate is obtained in one of two forms depending on the method of reclamation. Glass reinforced (GR) S/MA grinds are recovered from mechanical separation processes such as air classifi- cation and hydrocyclone while solvent separation processes yield unreinforced S/MA resin. The GR S/MA recyclate grinds can be dry blended with virgin material (on site, if desired) and remolded directly. The S/MA resin recyclate, however, requires recompound- ing if a GR S/MA is the desired end product. Most of the discussion in this paper will focus on material representative of GR S/MA recy- clate recovered by mechanical separation. The IP offal recycling studies involved formulating the known impurities with virgin GR S/MA to allow a sensitivity analysis. Actual recyclate as obtained from air classification was used in the post consumer IP recycling studies. Recyclate purity is an additional consideration when mechanical separation processes are used. Impurity level and certainly impurity type is directly related to the initial IP construction. In this paper, two IP constructions will be considered, the conventional IP and the developmental IP. The conventional IP is used to refer to construc- tions utilizing vinyl skins and polyurethane (PU) foams. The con- ventional IP is representative of the majority of soft feel IPs cur- rently produced today. The developmental IP construction discus- sion will be limited to thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) skins and crosslinked polypropylene (XPP) foams. It is worth emphasizing at this point that mechanical separation can not enhance the value of the associated recyclate beyond the value affiliated with standard regrind which is typically composed of sprues, runners, etc. Therefore, in blends wit virgin material, recycle from mechanical separation can not exceed the maximum level of regrind acceptable for a particular application (typically 1 5%-20% for IPs). 940656. (SP- 1035) Vehicle model complexity - How much is too much. Bangalore A. Suresh and Brian J. Gilmo re, Pennsylvania Transportation Institute. Simulation studies are widespread in vehicle handling/dynamics analysis. Over the years, many researchers have developed vehicle models ranging from a simple half-car model to a very detailed model. There is a general perception that a detailed model is guaran- teed to yield a better result; yet it should be noted there are no rec- ommended or standard procedures to measure vehicle parameters required for simulation studies. Recent studies have revealed that different measurement procedures could lead to significant differ- ences in the measured parameters. This paper discusses the issue of model complexity in the context of available input parameters, espe- cially tire data. Also, for vehicular application, the lumped parame- ter modeling approach and multi-body formulation approach advan- tages and disadvantages are discussed. 940657. A manufacturing cost analysis of tube and node steel spaceframes. JeffR. Diffenbach, IBIS Associates, Inc. ; and J. Bruce Emmons, Autokinetics. The design and manufacture of today's automobile structure is dominated by a singe approach: the stamping and spot welding of sheet steel. There are, however, a number of potential challengers to this steel unibody approach. These include a steel spaceframe, an aluminum unibody, an aluminum spaceframe, a composite mono- coque, and hybrids of these types. The primary barriers to adopting these alternatives have been technical practicality and cost. This paper considers one of the alternative approaches - the steel spaceframe - and examines its cost for two potential design and manufacturing scenarios using a computer spreadsheet based technique called Technical Cost Modeling. Selected default assumptions - including annual production volume, piece count, and assembly rates - are then varied to assess their impact on overall cost. The manufacturing costs for a conventional steel unibody as well as several of the other alternatives are used as a baseline for comparison. The results of this paper shed light on the economics of the steel spaceframe and thus its potential for market acceptance. 940658. (SP- 1035) Application of a control system CAD pro- gram to a study of an electronic engine control system. Hiroyuki Itoyama, Masaaki Uchida, Nobutaka Takahashi, and Kazutaka Adachi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. 82</page><page sequence="82">940658-940666 Automotive electronic control systems have tended to become more complex in recent years as a result of stronger requirements for environmental friendliness and higher levels of driveability. The first step in developing a control system is to study the required logic and system configuration at the initial stage of new vehicle development. The authors have incorporated an engine-vehicle model in a control system CAD program to simulate the logic needed for various control tasks. This paper presents a typical appli- cation in which a behavior of some outputs, such as engine torque and acceleration, were analyzed, and the electronic controls needed to assure driveability were identified. The construction and opera- tion of a controller-in-the-loop system are also described. 940659. Development of an optimum design program for wiper linkages. Jin-Ho Choi and Dong-Hoon Choi, Hanyang Univ.; and Myung-Won Suh and Jin-Won Suh, Kia Motors Corp. An optimization program for the design of wiper linkages is developed to minimize jerky motion while satisfying design con- straints on kinematic and torque performances, mobility condition, and packaging. The lengths/orientations of links and the position of a driving motor are selected as design variables. In our optimum design program for wiper linkages, an optimization module interacts with an analysis module which calculates kinematic and force/ torque properties, until convergence. The optimization results of a particular wiper linkage are pres- ented to illustrate the effectiveness of the program developed. 940660. (SP- 1035) Rapid engine development system for internal combustion engines: from concept to production vali- dation. P. J. Stewart, Perkins Technology, Ltd. A project management system covering all aspects of advanced internal combustion engine development, from concept to high- vol- ume series production within three years has been developed by Per- kins Technology Limited. This paper focuses on the engine develop- ment aspects of the system with an overview of the principal techni- cal processes. 940661. (SP- 1035) Supplier improvement process plan. Richard D. Fauteck and Gary C. Studziński, Ford Motor Co. Ford Motor Company Powertrain Engineering instituted an inno- vative Work Process Plan designed to evaluate, develop, and improve its selected long-term suppler base. This process was implemented in 1987 and continues to function improving our sup- pliers capabilities in the areas of Product &amp; Manufacturing Engi- neering, Quality, Production Control, and Sales/Purchasing Interac- tion. A pilot Supply Base Development, Casting and Machining team was set-up in July, 1987 to assist the casting, machining, piston, and ring supply base. The success of this team lead to the formation of three additional Supply Base Development teams within the follow- ing year to assist suppliers in Sealing, Assemblies, and Front End Accessory Drive (FEAD) commodities. The benefits of this process to Ford and its suppliers has resulted in assisting two suppliers to reach the TQE level, support the Ford directive to bring all suppliers to the Q-l level, guide suppliers not meeting the minimum technical levels required by Ford Powertrain to meet those levels, and institute cross-functional training and team building at Ford and its suppliers. 940662. (SP- 1035) Optimizing resistance spot welding of alu- minum-alloy 6111 autobody sheet. Eric Pickering and Charles J. Hart, Reynolds Metals Co. Aluminum use for automotive body sheet applications is grow- ing. This growth requires improvement of related joining processes and technology. Resistance spot welding will be one of the major joining technologies used in assembling automobiles. When spot welding aluminum, electrode tip life is limited by tip erosion and pickup of aluminum on the tip. Increasing weld current improves weld strength (to a limit), however this reduces tip life. This study examines the control variables in the resistance spot welding process and offers an improved weld schedule to achieve desired weld properties while maximizing tip life. First, the limits of weld parameters where satisfactory welds can be obtained are determined. A window of tip force and weld current is established for a given material and tip geometry. These limits are used to opti- mize the weld schedule in terms of tip life. Spot welds fail on the basis of shear strength, button diameter or peel rate. Weld parameters determine the probable failure mode. An analysis of the failure mode is also used to optimize the weld sched- ule. We will also examine the effects of various surface treatments on weld quality and electrode tip life. 940663. (SP- 1035) Customer/supplier partnership for quality improvement and cost reduction. Om P. Gupta, Zexel-Gleason, Inc.; and Scott Eighmy, American Turned Products. As the automotive industry establishes itself for a global position in respect to Cost and Quality, the supplier industry must follow by making quantum cost reductions and quality improvements. Zexel-Gleason, Inc. manufactures a unique TORSEN traction differential system. Drastic cost reduction was the only way to improve competitive position and increase sales. As part of an over- all product cost reduction project, a long term component supplier was given an opportunity to reduce cost which was not accom- plished due to the culture barrier of "business as usual". Zexel- Gleason selected American Turned Products (ATP) as the new sup- plier for the Journal Pins used in its TORSEN T1 product. This paper covers a unique customer/supplier partnership which has developed between these two companies. Both Zexel-Gleason and American Turned Products have benefitted. These benefits are presented in this paper. Zexel-Gleason benefitted by meeting its cost reduction and qual- ity improvement target on a long term basis and developed a sup- plier who will assume full component responsibility-Quality, Cost, Delivery and Flexibility. American Turned Products benefitted by learning the benefits of up front quality planning, learning the effec- tive use of SPC and fool-proofing the processes as well as being proactive in cost management. This has helped ATP in gaining other business as well. The stage has been set for both companies to learn from these positive experiences relating to Quality Improvement and Cost Reduction and help them to grow their respective businesses. Other companies in the automotive industry may benefit from the lessons learned by this unique customer/supplier partnership. 940665. (SP- 1035) Development of the inspective devices using 3D visual sensor for measuring volume of the piston com- bustion chamber at production line. Koji Kuno, Kazuya Nakashima, and Hiroyuki Suganuma, Aisen Seiki Co., Ltd.; and Kazunori Higuchi, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc. Automating the inspection of the piston combustion chamber volume is difficult and prevents establishing an unmanned machin- ing process of the piston in the future. So, we developed an inspec- tion technique which uses a Range Finder, non-contact visual sen- sor, and calculate the chamber volume by integrating 3D position data. We applied this real-time measurement technique which enables 100% inspection to our production lines. Then, we devel- oped the "Defect Free Production Line", which calibrates itself by feeding back the measured volume data to the machining process. Our paper will explain this inspection technique and our "Defect Free Production Line". 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940666. (SP- 1028) Diesel exhaust emissions prediction under transient operating conditions. Z Bazari, Lloyd's Register. A non-linear transient engine cycle simulation software has been integrated to a versatile quasi two-dimensional multi-zone combus- tion-emissions model in order to predict exhaust emissions under transient operating conditions. The basic engine and exhaust emis- sion models are outlined with special reference to the requirements 83</page><page sequence="83">940666-940672 of engine transient operation. The predictive capability of the simu- lation is demonstrated through comparison of measured and pre- dicted performance and emissions for several engine transients. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940667. (SP- 1028) Development of OSKA-DH diesel engine using fuel jet impingement and diffusion - Investigation of mix- ture formation and combustion. Saloshi Kato and Shigeru Onishi, Nippon Clean Engine Lab. Co.; and Hideaki Tanabe and G. Takeshi Sato, Kanazawa Institute of Technology. This study is concerned with development of a new type of diesel engine using the fuel jet impingement (OSKA-DH). Simultaneous reduction of the NOx and smoke emission were demonstrated with single cylinder prototype OSKA-DH engine. As a fundamental study on the mixture formation process, the observation of impinged fuel spray was studied by using a pressur- ized constant volume vessel. The high-speed combustion photo- graphs of both re-entrant and open type combustion chamber were also taken by using the experimental transparent engine. From the observation of pressurized vessel and high-speed com- bustion photographs, the mixture formation and combustion was strongly affected by the squish flow velocity. The short ignition delay and faster combustion were observed by the re- entrant type combustion chamber because of high squish speed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940668. (SP- 1028) Measurement of the effect of injection rate and split injections on diesel engine soot and NOx emissions. D. A. Nehmer and R. D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin. This study was conducted to develop an understanding of how rate-shaped and split injections can affect the soot and NOx emis- sions of a heavy-duty diesel engine. The test were performed on a single cylinder version of the Caterpillar 3406 production engine, modified to accept an electronically-controlled, high- pressure com- mon-rail injection system that offers a very high degree of flexibility in injection timing, split injections, and rate shaping of the initial injection. The engine was instrumented for particulate measure- ments with a full dilution tunnel, and CO, C02, NOx emission meters. Cylinder pressure was used to study heat release rates, and the response to changes in the injection scheme. The results show that rate-shaped injection, when optimized for lowest BSFC, does not appreciably affect pressure rise or peak cylinder gas pressures. Split injections, however, allowed peak pressures to be reduced by more than 45%, and have a significant effect on the overall rate of pressure rise. The emission measurements showed that split injec- tions have a trend of reduced NOx as the quantity of fuel in the first injection is reduced, without particulate emissions increasing rap- idly. Furthermore, it was determined that split injection better uti- lizes the air charge and allows combustion to continue later into the power stroke than for a single injection case, without increased levels of soot production. This indicates that pulsed injection may provide a means to reduce particulate emissions, and allow for reduced NOx from controlled pressure rise. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940669. (SP- 1028) Effects of increased altitude on heavy-duty diesel engine emissions. Cynthia A. Chaffin and Terry L. Ullman, Southwest Research Institute. Concern over emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines at high altitudes prompted an investigation into the effects of increasing altitude on gaseous and particulate emissions. On behalf of the Engine Manufacturers Association, emissions from a Detroit Diesel Corporation Series 60 at local test conditions (barometer 98.9 kPa), and two simulated altitudes, Denver (82.6 kPa) and Mexico City (77.9 kPa) were examined using a special altitude simulation CVS. Transient torque output and full load steady-state torque, for this turbocharged aftercooled engine, decreased slightly with increasing altitude. Although, the DDC Series 60 compensates for variation in barometer, transient composite emission of HC, CO, CO2, smoke, and particulate matter generally increased with increasing altitude for both transient and steady-state operation. No significant change in transient composite NOx emissions with altitude was noted during transient testing, but NOx emissions slightly decreased with increas- ing altitude for steady-state operation. Peak smoke opacity deter- mined in the snap-smoke test procedure increased approximately 80 percent when apparent barometric pressure was decreased from 98.9 kPa to 77.9 kPa. 940670. (SP- 1028) Direct injection diesel engine soot model- ing: formulation and results. William H. Lipkea and Arnold D. DeJoode, Deere Power Systems Group. The objective of this work was to develop simplified soot models for use with a direct injection diesel engine combustion simulation. The soot models, when used with the combustion simulation, were required to be able to predict engine exhaust emissions trends, to be sensitive to major combustion system variables, and yet to be effi- cient enough to be used with an engine cycle simulation and formal mathematical optimization procedures. The background of soot for- mation in diesel engines is reviewed and the assumptions for the models are discussed. The resulting models have global soot forma- tion and consumption steps with an Arrhenious temperature depen- dence. The choice of the model constants, the selection procedure for the constants, and the sensitivity of the constants to engine oper- ating conditions are presented. General considerations for the testing of emissions models and possible extensions of the soot models are discussed. Comparisons of model predictions with the experimental data at several operating conditions demonstrate that the models are sensitive to major combustion system variables, predict the correct soot emissions trends and are computationally efficient. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940671. (SP- 1028) A three-zone heat release model for DI die- sel engines. G. V. J. Sastry and Harish Chandra, Automotive Research Association of India. Heat release analysis brings out the various phenomena that cause the development of the combustion chamber pressure. A three-zone heat release model computes the rate of heat release and other properties of all the three zones (representing vaporized fuel, unburnt and burnt gas zones) for measured pressure-crank angle data obtained from an instrumented engine. It is a useful diagnostic tool giving a great deal of information about an existing engine. Heat release analyses for Five different operating conditions have been conducted for a DI diesel engine. Also, ignition delay, wall heat losses and mass, volume and temperature in each of the three zones have been computed. It is found that the overall quality of the computed heat release rates are strongly dependent on the accuracy of the measured pressure data. The model can be integrated to a high speed data acquisition system for concurrent analysis of the heat release patterns. 940672. (SP- 1028) Technology for low emission, combustion noise and fuel consumption on diesel engine. Susumi Kohketsu , Kazutoshi Mori, Tetsuro Kato, and Kenji Sakai, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. In order to reduce exhaust emission and combustion noise and to improve fuel consumption, the effects of the combustion system parameters of a diesel engine, such as injection pressure, injection nozzle hole diameter, swirl ratio, and EGR rate on exhaust emis- sions, combustion noise and fuel consumption are investigated and described in detail by analyzing rate of heat release, needle valve lift and injection pressure. Based on these results, reduction of exhaust emission and combustion noise and improvement of fuel consumption are described in the latter part of this paper. These results are shown as follows. The smaller nozzle hole diameter is effective for reducing smoke and PM, and by optimizing the injec- tion timing and swirl ratio, NOx can also be reduced. In addition to the above, by applying EGR and higher injection pressure it is possi- ble to improve the fuel consumption with the remaining low NOx and PM. It is effective to apply higher compression ratio and smaller 84</page><page sequence="84">940672-940677 injection nozzle hole diameter for reducing combustion noise with the remaining low exhaust emissions. 940673. (SP- 1028) Analysis of the irreversibilities in diesel engines. José Antonio Velásques, DAMEC - CEFET - PR; and Luiz Fernando Milanez, DE - FEM - UNICAMP. Comparative studies regarding the optimization of internal com- bustion engines sometimes are carried out according to the perspec- tive of an exergetic analysis. Time or space-time resolved irrevers- ibilities and irreversibility production rates are determined, depend- ing on the information that the simulation model permits. However, the irreversibility production rates not always provide an appropri- ate criterion for comparisons to be made. For these cases Second Law efficiencies are used to evaluate the degree of reversibility of each process or of the complete cycle. Nevertheless this procedure does not allow to explore the advantages that a time or space-time resolved model can offer. In this work an instantaneous Second Law efficiency is proposed from the differential equation of the energy balance. It is shown that this parameter provides a consistent com- parison criterion for situations when comparisons based on the irre- versibility production rates may lead to in appropriate conclusions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940674. (SP- 1028) Preinjection - A measure to optimize the emission behavior of Dl-diesel engines. Manfred Diirnholz, Hel- mut Endres, and Peter Frisse, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH &amp; Co. KG. Diesel engines continue to offer outstanding benefits in fuel con- sumption and durability over other engine types. Recently however, the environmental impact of diesel engines has become an increas- ingly critical factor and has a significant influence on diesel engine development trends. The fuel injection system is one of the most important keys to fulfill the stringent exhaust emissions standards while still maintaining the fuel economy and related CO2 emission benefits of the diesel engine. Research has shown that, to a significant extent, by using the technique of fuel preinjection, DI diesel engines can simultaneously reduce NOx levels and particulate emissions while also improving the level of combustion noise. In addition, the technique has demon- strated the possibility to address these environmentally-focused goals while maintaining low fuel consumption, a characteristic strength of diesel engines, which is directly related to the reductions in CO2 emissions. Since all of these important environmental factors are significantly influenced by the fuel injection system characteris- tics, it will undoubtedly play a dominant role in successful future diesel engine development. This paper outlines and describes potential improvements in combustion and exhaust emission characteristics through the appli- cation of injection rate shaping and pilot fuel injection. These improvements will be analyzed for many applications using a proto- type injection system with advanced hydraulic performance. Fur- thermore, it will show how pilot injection should be performed in order to get both a reduction of exhaust emissions and combustion noise. Finally, the potential for optimizing engine behavior, through variation of these injection system characteristics, will be discussed. 940675. (SP- 1028) Combustion and emissions in a new con- cept DI stratified charge engine with two-stage fuel injection. N oboru Miyamoto, Hideyuki Ogawa, and Toshio Shudo, Hokkaido Univ.; and Fumiaki Takeyama, Japan Railway Co. A new concept DISC engine equipped with a two-stage injection system was developed. The engine was modified from a single cyl- inder DI diesel engine with large cylinder diameter (135 mm). Com- bustion characteristics and exhaust emissions with regular gasoline were examined, and the experiments were also made with gasoline- diesel fuel blends with higher boiling temperatures and lower octane numbers. To realize stratified mixture distribution in combustion chamber flexibly, the fuel was injected in two- stages: the first stage was before the compression stroke to create an uniform premixed lean mixture and the second stage was at the end of the compression stroke to maintain stable ignition and faster combustion. In this paper, the effect of the two- stage injection on combustion and exhaust emissions were analyzed under several operating condi- tions. The results showed that stable and smooth combustion without knocking over a wide range of operation could be realized in the new concept DISC engine, and compared with stoichiometric homo- geneous combustion at a BMEP of 0.61MPa, simultaneous 30% SFC and 50% NOx reductions were achieved. The SFC and NOx were reduced remarkably not only in the lean conditions but also in the stoichiometric conditions by the stratified charge combustion with the two-stage injection. Optimization for spark timings, sec- ondary fuel injection timings, the proportion of two-stage injection, were essential for efficient combustion and ignition. Smokeless and knockfree operation could also be achieved with higher boiling tem- perature and lower octane number fuels. Soot was not detected even with gasoline containing 50vol. % diesel fuel. 940676. (SP- 1028) Influence of the molecular structure of hydrocarbon fuels on diesel exhaust emissions. N oboru Miya- moto, Hideyuki Igawa, Masahiko Shibuya, Keiji Arai, and Olivier Esmilaire, Hokkaido Univ. The influence of the molecular structure of hydrocarbon fuels on soot, SOF, and NOx emissions from a diesel engine was analyzed while ignition delay and other physical fuel properties were kept constant. Mixtures of normal paraffin (n-tetradecane) and iso- paraf- fin (heptamethylnonane) were used as a base fuel and one of 5 kinds of hydrocarbons including mono-aromatic, di-aromatic, and non- aromatic were added. The aromatic content varied in the range of 0-60 vol% for the mono-aromatic fuels and 0-40 vol% for the di- aromatic fuels. The experimental results showed that regardless of the molecular structure of the fuel, both particulate and NOx emis- sion increased linearly with the C/H atomic ratio of the fuels under constant ignition lag. The increase in particulate emission with C/H atomic ratio was caused by increases in dry soot. The SOF, THC, and BSEC were little affected by the C/H atomic ratio and molecular structure of the fuels. The fuel properties discussed here showed similar results in both DI and IDI engines. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940677. (SP- 1028) Interactions and main effects with auxil- iary injection a two- stroke DI diesel engine. Jospeh S. Shakal, Tsukuba Science City ; and Jay K. Martin, University of Wisconsin. A two-stroke diesel engine was outfitted for operation with an electronic solenoid-controlled unit injector and an additional sole- noid-controlled air-assisted injector at the inlet ports. Factorial experiments were designed in order to quantify, in a statistically rep- resentative manner, the effects of pilot (or 'split') and port auxiliary injection on main fuel combustion. Results indicated that interactions between experimental parame- ters (such as between pilot fuel quantity and pilot-to-main spacing), as well as main effects are important in analyzing auxiliary fuel injection. The bulk gas temperature at main injection was deter- mined primarily by the experimental parameters acting indepen- dently of one another, which is a case where main effects only are important. Conversely, analysis of indicated specific fuel consump- tion and peak cylinder pressure involved interactions of the experi- mental parameters in both cases. Other results indicated that addition of a pilot injection could effectively separate the premixed and diffusion portions of the com- bustion process. The port fuel was observed to undergo a two-stage ignition process and suppress the premixed burn of the main fuel. The early premixed burn spike of the pilot fuel could increase the bulk gas temperature at main injection by over 350 K. The two-stage ignition process of the port fuel could cause an increase in this quan- tity of up to 200 K. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 85</page><page sequence="85">940678-940683 940678. Flow and heat transfer characteristics of impinging transient diesel sprays. C. Arcoumanis and J-C. Chang, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. The spatial and temporal characteristics of transient diesel sprays impinging on unheated and heated walls were investigated by phase doppler anemometry (PDA) and the heat-transfer distribution in the vicinity of the impingement region was determined by fast response thermocouples. The results have provided quantitative evidence about the effect that the presence of the flat wall exerts on the spray characteristics. For example, independent of the thickness of the liq- uid film, the wall rearranges the droplet size distribution of the free spray with droplet collision and coalescence playing an important role in both the droplet redistribution and in the development of the wall-jet. Droplet sizes were reduced and mean tangential velocities increased with wall temperature at the upstream side and at the front of the wall-jet, respectively. The wall temperature also affected the rearrangement of the droplet size distribution by reducing droplet coalescence at the leading edge of the wall-jet and enhancing it after the passage of the head vortex. The pre-impingement droplet veloci- ties were found to play the dominant role on the local, time-resolved heat transfer rates; the higher the pre-impingement axial droplet velocities are, the higher the heat transfer rate. A correlation for the instantaneous and spatially-resolved spray/wall heat transfer was thus developed, based on a Nu-Re-Pr-We number relationship, which can be useful for multi-dimensional computer simulations of diesel engine combustion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940679. Engine-based image acquisition for piloted diesel fuel spray analysis. D. Pushka, K. Sinko, and B. Chehroudi, Uni- versity of Illinois. An optically-accessible research engine, image acquisition, and a control system are designed to acquire two-dimensional images of a pilot and main diesel fuel sprays. This paper presents the engine- based apparatus, image acquisition techniques, and preliminary results of analysis performed upon interacting diesel fuel sprays. The engine is a single-cylinder compression-ignition two-stroke with optically-accessible head mounted on a high speed CFR engine crankcase. It is equipped with a special dual-injection system for production of in- cylinder interacting sprays (main and pilot) with a high degree of adjustability with regard to the sprays fuel quanti- ties and injection timings. The engine construction permits illumina- tion of the sprays by a thin sheet of laser light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser frequency doubled to operate at the visible wave- length of 532 nm. Light scattered from the droplets passes through a top- mounted viewing window on a diode array camera, yielding a digital image which defines the boundary of the spray plumes. Within the plumes the varying scattered-light intensity permitted acquisition of spatially-resolved images of the interacting sprays. Personal-computer-based programs control injector activation times, synchronize operation of the laser illumination system, and acquire/process and display of the spray plume images. Two dimen- sional images are presented and discussed for a selected condition. 940680. A/F ratio visualization in a diesel spray. Kevein Cara- bell and Patrick Farrell, University of Wisconsin. We have applied an imaging system to a spray in an engine-fed combustion bomb to investigate some of the features of diesel spray ignition. A high pressure electronic unit injector with main and pilot injection features was used. Our interest in this work was the local air/fuel ratio, particularly in the vicinity of the spray plumes. The measurement was made by seeding the air in the intake man- ifold with biacetyl. A tripled Nd:YAG laser causes the biacetyl to fluoresce with a signal that is proportional to its local concentration. The biacetyl partial pressure was carefully controlled, enabling approximate estimates of the local stoichiometry in the fuel spray. Twenty-four different cases were sampled. Parameter varied include swirl ratio, fuel quantity, number of holes in the fuel nozzle and distribution of fuel quantities in the pilot and main injections. This paper presents the results of three of these cases. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940681. Spray and self-ignition visualization a DI diesel engine. T. A. Baritaud, T. A. Heinze, and J. F. Le Coz, institut Fran- çais du Pétrole. In a DI diesel engine with optical access, spray and self- ignition were visualized. The engine was designed to provide a large optical access, no spray impingement and thermodynamic conditions close to those of commercial engines. The spray from a single hole injec- tor and the combustion zone can be fully observed. Laser induced exciplex fluorescence is used to provide information on the the spray structure as well as penetration. Luminous emission from the burnt gases served as a marker of the self-ignition sites. The flow field was characterized with laser anemometry. Data from these three techniques were collected for a set of oper- ating conditions involving changes of air temperature, pressure in the cylinder, injected quantity and engine speed. The effect of vary- ing these parameters is discussed. At the beginning of spray penetra- tion, the liquid and vapor advance at the same speed. Quite soon, the liquid phase stops its progression while the gas phase continues to progress. Self- ignition occurs in a region of high mean shear quite close to the nozzle, often close to the liquid phase tip. This was explained by the presence of coherent structures in the liquid spray creating favorable self-ignition sites. This mechanism was con- firmed by simultaneous self-ignition and liquid Mie scattering visu- alizations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940682. Quantitative 2-D fuel vapor concentration imaging in a firing D.I. diesel engine using planar laser-induced Rayleigh scattering. Christoph Espey, Pennsylvania State Univ.; John E. Dec, Sandia National Labs.; and Thomas A. Litzinger and Domenie A. Santavicca, Pennsylvania State Univ. The application of planar laser-induced Rayleigh scattering for quantitative 2-D measurements of vapor-phase fuel concentration in the main combustion zone of a direct-injection diesel engine has been explored, developed and demonstrated. All studies were con- ducted in an optically accessible direct- injection diesel engine of the "heavy-duty" size class as 1200 rpm and motored TDC condi- tions which were typical of the production version of this engine. First, this study verifies that beyond 27 mm from the injector all the fuel is vapor phase. This was done by investigating the diesel jet under high magnification using 2-D elastic scatter imaging and subsequently evaluating the signal intensities from the droplets and other interfering particles (Mie scattering) and the vapor (Rayleigh scattering). Then, in this vapor-phase region, which corresponds to the main combustion zone in this engine, planar laser-induced Ray- leigh scattering was applied to obtain quantitative 2-D fuel-vapor concentration images of the fuel-air mixture from 4.0° to 5.5° after start of injection (ASI). At 4.5° ASI, which corresponds to the time of first indicated heat release, the fuel and air were relatively well mixed throughout the leading portion of the diesel jet. The equiva- lence ratio in the majority of the jet ranged from 3 to 5.5. The edge of the jet at the front and along the sides was well defined with the signal level rising sharply from the background air level up to levels corresponding to equivalence ratios of 4 to 5. By 5.0° ASI, the fuel vapor concentration the front of the jet has decreased sharply to near stoichiometric values indicating rapid mixing of the fuel with the air. Then at 5.5° ASI extremely low Rayleigh signal intensities in the images suggest regions of early premixed combustion with no evidence of soot formation at these crank angles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940683. The effects of wall temperature on flame structure during flame quenching. David J. Cleary and Patrick V. Farrell, University of Wisconsin. 86</page><page sequence="86">940683-940688 The effect of wall temperature on single surface flame quenching and flame structure of an atmospheric premixed methane- air flames were studied. The luminous region of a laminar flame was located at an angle of 45 degrees to a temperature-controlled surface. C2 laser-induced fluorescence was used as an indicator of flame posi- tion while Raman spectroscopy was used to determine gas tempera- ture profiles near the surface. These measurements were conducted for wall positions (vertical distance from the surface) ranging from 50 ļum to 1.0 mm and wall temperatures ranging from 150°C to 600°C. C2 laser-induced fluorescence measurements indicated flame position is affected by the presence of a surface and the surface tem- perature. Larger C2 fluorescence intensity values were observed for higher wall temperatures at all distances from the surface. At a posi- tion of 50pm from the surface, the C2 fluorescence intensity for a wall temperature of 600°C was 2.5 times the C2 fluorescence inten- sity for a wall temperature of 250°C at the same location. A single surface flame quenching distance, based on C2 fluorescence mea- surements, was determined. It was found to be a non-linear function of wall temperature. The flame quenching distance varied approxi- mately linearly with wall temperatures ranging from 150°C to 450°c, but showed a non-liner variation for wall temperatures rang- ing from 450°C to 600°C. Pulsed spontaneous Raman spectroscopy of nitrogen was used to measure the gas temperature profiles near the wall. These measure- ments showed that a wall temperature of 600°C resulted in higher gas temperatures for wall positions less than 280 firn from the sur- face compared to gas temperatures at the same locations at a wall temperature of 250°C. However, for distances far from the wall (&gt;350pm), the gas temperature at sampled locations was approxi- mately 100°C lower for a wall temperature of 600°C compared to a wall temperature of 250°C. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940684. Combustion analysis of methanol-fueled Active Thermo- Atmosphere Combustion (ATAC) engine using a spec- troscopic observation. Norimasa lida, Keio Univ. To analyze the combustion mechanism of the so-called Active Thermo-Atmosphere Combustion (ATAC) in a two stroke S.I. engine, a measuring system to obtain images of radical lumines- cence in the combustion chamber was developed. The ATAC engine tested was equipped with quartz windows as the cylinder head. The instantaneous luminescence from radical species was observed using an image intensifier with a single band pass filter for both con- ventional and ATAC operating conditions. At ATAC operation, emissions from OH radicals were observed before heat release began, and after that, emissions for CH were observed. It wa found that the ignition was initiated over the entire area of the combustion chamber and "bulk-like" and/or "non propagating" combustion occurred during ATAC engine operation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940685. Spatially resolved determination of the turbulent flame speed from CH band emission measurements under engine conditions. A. D. Grudno, S. E. Trautwein, H. J. Wassen- berg, and G. Adomeil, University1 of Technology. A single stroke compression expansion apparatus is used to investigate the flame propagation under SI engine conditions. The gas is ignited by a row of electrodes located along the center line of the cylinder head of a square cross section combustion chamber. This leads to a cylindrical flame geometry which allows spatially resolved measurements of the light emission. The quasi two dimen- sional flame geometry allows the determination of the origin of the light emission and the distinction between the flame zone and the regions of burnt and unburnt gas. The correlation of the light emission of the CH band at 43 1 .5 nm with the mass burning rate is used to derive information about the mass burning rate distribution from CH ban emission measure- ments. In the selected region of the CH band emission a consider- able intensity of light emission emanating from the burnt hot gas region is also observed. From this part the emission originating from the flame zone is separated. It correlates well with the mass burning rate. By measuring the spatial and temporal distribution of this quantity the local flames speed relative to the unburned gas along the flame surface can be determined. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940687. Early flame acceleration measurements in a turbu- lent spark- ignited mixture. D. S-K Ting, M. D. Checkel, R. Haley, and P. R. Smy, University of Alberta. Research on ignition, flame growth and flame propagation in engine-like turbulence has produced widely varying correlations between turbulence parameters and flame speed. Some previous work has shown that the burning velocity observed in a given turbu- lence level depends on the flame size as well as the turbulence inten- sity and scale. This explains some of the previous experimental dis- crepancy and emphasizes the importance of measuring flame growth and turbulence effects over the range of interest for a given model- ing requirement. This paper reports on an experimental study of flame growth from ignition sparks in spatially uniform, decaying turbulence similar to that found in engine combustion chambers. High speed Schlieren video and pressure trace analyses were used to study 3-dimensional turbulent flame growth in a constant volume, cubical combustion chamber. Lean methane-air mixtures of 60%, 70%, 80% 90% and 100% stoichiometric compositions were ignited at 1 atm and 300 K. Schlieren images of flame growth were recorded on high speed video at 2000 frames per second while the combus- tion chamber pressure rise was recorded concurrently. The com- bined high speed Schlieren video and pressure trace analyses enables the study of flames growth from ignition spark until the end of combustion. Pre-ignition turbulence was generated by pulling a perforated plate across the chamber. The ignition-time turbulence intensity ranged from 0 to 2 m/s with integral scale of 8, 4, 2 or 1 mm depending on the plate hole size. The assumed turbulence inten- sity during flame propagation was continually adjusted to account for viscous decay and rapid distortion. Laminar flame growth calculated from the pressure trace using a multi-zone thermodynamic model agreed well with the flame growth deduced from high speed Schlieren video. Results showed that laminar flames grew at a quasi-steady rate determined by the laminar flame speed and chamber temperature and pressure. Turbu- lent flames were found to accelerate from the ignition spark until the flame was quenched by the walls, by which time it was many times larger than the turbulence length scale. Burning velocity results show that, for a given flame size, the normalized turbulent burning velocity, St/Si, is approximately proportional to the normal- ized rms turbulence intensity, uVSi; where St is the turbulent burning velocity and u' is the rms turbulence intensity. The slope of this roughly linear relation increases with increasing flame size and decreases with increasing integral scale. In short, a given level of combustion chamber turbulence becomes progressively more effec- tive in enhancing the burning velocity as the turbulent flame grows. For a fixed turbulence intensity and flame size, faster burning can also be achieved by using smaller scale turbulence. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940688. (SP- 101 7) Influence of pulley profile on automotive accessory drive noise. J. E. Connell, Gates Rubber Co.; and R. J. Meckstroth, Eord Motor Co. This paper presents the findings of an experimental study to investigate the effect of pulley profile variations on belt misalign- ment noise performance. Pulleys were devised which featured vari- ous geometry modifications to the standard K-section V-ribbed belt profile. A series of tests were run to assess the impact on misalign- ment noise ("chirp") using a single belt construction. Supplemen- tary data on belt wear and belt stability is also provided. Results demonstrate pulley diameter to have a significant effect on noise and belt stability. Notable yet less substantial differences were observed as a result of K-section profile modifications. These findings pro- vide accessory drive designers with additional insight into issues 87</page><page sequence="87">940688-940696 associateci with improving the overall noise performance of the FEAD system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940689. (SP- 101 7) Torsional response of automotive timing chain systems. Sheng-Jian Hwang and Lynn M. Retallack, Ford Motor Co. An analytical model is developed to describe the longitudinal response of the timing chain and the associated torsional response of all the sprockets and tensioner. A closed-form equilibrium analy- sis reveals that equilibrium tensions are functions of tensioner stiff- ness, chain preload, steady cam torques and engine speed. The equa- tions of motion are linearized about the equilibrium position to determine natural frequencies, mode shapes of the torsional modes and the forced response due to cam torque harmonics. Experimental measurements of the system natural frequencies and the forced amplitudes are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940690. (SP- 1017) A new approach for analyzing load distri- bution of toothed belts at steady states using FEM. Ryuichi Kido and Takayuki Kusano , Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.; and Toru Fujii, Doshisha Univ. A concept and a (nonlinear finite element) model of how to ana- lyze load distribution of toothed belts having curvilinear tooth pro- files for automotive engines at steady states was developed by utiliz- ing a general nonlinear finite element program considering contact problems as well as geometrical nonlinear problems. A toothed belt in the FEM model consists of circularly linked beam elements for endless tension members and two dimensional solid elements for a belt body. A curved pulley surface is supposed to be rigid. Interac- tion between surfaces of belt teeth and pulleys is considered as mov- ing boundaries. A quite good agreement between experimental and computed results for frictional forces and tooth load confirms that the proposed model is presently the only one practical approach for analyzing load distribution of toothed belts which none of the exist- ing theories can do. Some numerical simulations were performed by changing parameters such as belt pitch, dimensions of teeth and so on. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940691. (SP- 1017) Improvement of multi-layer aluminum- silicon-tin bearings for high power engines through a reinforced intermediate layer. Yoshiaki Sato, Yoshikazu Mizuno, Masaaki Sakamoto, and Tadashi Tanaka, Daido Metal Co., Ltd. The recent trend toward the compact and light-weight construc- tion of automotive engines with high power output has been impos- ing higher requirements of fatigue strength, anti- seizure property and conformability on bearings. In order to meet these requirements, the authors analyzed the property of each layer of multi-layer Al- Si-Sn bearings and investigated its influences on bearing perfor- mance. Improvement was achieved as to the bearing alloy and the intermediate bonding layer based on the results of the investigation. As a result, this newly improved bearing has been concluded to pro- vide better fatigue strength than conventional bearings. It has thus become possible to apply it as a bearing for the recent engines used under harsh conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940693. (SP- 101 7) Achieving a selected load distribution in the bolted joint of a cylinder head of highly variable stiffness and contact geometry. Donald L. Goddard and George D. Bibel, University of North Dakota. A preselected, non-uniform load distribution was obtained in a single-pass, load-controlled, bolt-up procedure. This was done by experimentally determining the elastic interaction coefficients. The coefficients were based on measurement of compressive load in the joint in the vicinity of the bolts being tightened. The elastic interac- tion coefficients were then used to predict what loads associated with the tightening of each bolt would be required to achieve a selected non-uniform load distribution in the joint. The procedure worked on a cylinder head of an overhead valve V-8 engine. The desired distribution of load was achieved with an average deviation of 4.7%. Most of the deviation is due to a single undesirable sensor/ bolt pairing which, if eliminated, results in an average deviation of 2% and a maximum deviation of 10%. 940694. (SP- 101 7) Analysis of stick-slip noise of piston ring. Keiichi Urano and Masao Ishida, Teikoku Piston Ring Co., Ltd. Reducing engine noise of passenger cars has always been a great concern to engine manufacturers. Of late, increasing attention has been paid to the noise developed during the idling operation of engines. There are various noises that can be produced in and around engines. In conducting an analysis of engine noise, the authors focused on the noise produced during the idling of gasoline engines that employ a 3-piece piston ring. The 3-piece oil ring has been iden- tified as a source of noise depending on the ring geometry and design employed. The noise is often made near the top and bottom dead centers with peak amplitude around frequencies of 2 to 3 kHz. The noise varies with the tension of the 3-piece oil ring and the peripheral form of the side rail. It is more likely to take place when the peripheral sliding surface of the side rail, in contact with the cylinder bore, is of a high unit pressure design. The stick-slip phenomenon of the 3-piece oil ring was suspected to be the cause of the noise. The axial (vertical) movement of the side rail having high unit pressure within the groove of the oil ring during the sliding motion of the piston was examined using a motor- ing test machine. This test was undertaken to develop and under- standing of the design parameters influencing the stick-slip phenom- enon. It was confirmed that the side rail with higher unit pressure form moves more violently than that with lower unit pressure form. The stick-slip phenomenon of the side rail was thus identified as a possi- ble cause of the noise. Accordingly, the low unit pressure peripheral form of the side rail combined with side clearance control is an effective solution of the noise problem during engine idling opera- tion. 940695. (SP- 1017) Engine experiments on the effects of design and operational parameters on piston secondary motion and piston slap. James P. Ryan, Victor W. Wong, Richard H. Lyon, and David P. Hoult, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Yoshiki Sekiya, Yoichi Kobayaski, and Shunichi Aoyama, Nissan Motor Co. Experiments were done to quantify the dynamic motion of the piston and oil-film during piston impact on the cylinder bore, com- monly known as "piston slap". Parameters measured include engine block vibration, piston-skirt to liner separation, oil- film thickness between the piston and liner, and other engine operating conditions. Experimental parametric studies were performed cover- ing the following: engine operating parameters - spark timing, liner temperature, oil-film thickness, oil type, and engine speed; and engine design parameters -piston-skirt surface waviness, piston- skirt/cylinder-liner clearance, and wrist-pin offset. Two dynamic modes of piston-motion-induced vibration were observed, and effects of changes in engine operating and design parameters were investigated for both types of slap. It was evident that engine design parameters have strong effects on piston slap intensity, with piston-skirt/liner clearance and wrist-pin offset being the dominant parameters. However, for given engine and component geometries, slap intensity was significantly affected by lubricant properties. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940696. (SP- 101 7) A numerical model of piston secondary motion and piston slap in partially flooded elastohydrodynamic skirt lubrication. Victor W.

Ryan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Yoshiki Sekiya, Yoichi Kobayashi, and Shunichi Aoyama, Nissan Motor Co. This paper presents a numerical model of the rotational and lat- eral dynamics of the piston (secondary motion) and piston slap in mixed lubrication. Piston dynamic behavior, frictional and impact forces are predicted as functions of crank angle. The model consid- ers piston skirt surface waviness, roughness, skirt profile, thermal and mechanical deformations. The model considers partially- flooded skirt and calculates the pressure distributions and friction in the piston skirt region for both hydrodynamic and boundary lubri- cation. Model predictions are compared with measurements of pis- ton position using gap sensors in a single-cylinder engine and the comparison between theory and measurement shows remarkable agreement. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940697. (SP- 101 7) The effect of bearing stiffness on crank- shaft natural frequencies. V. Prakash, Bharat Earth Movers Ltd.; and D. N. Venkatesh and U. Shrinivasa, Indian Institute of Science. Crankshafts of internal combustion engines are torsionally soft; they are well known to get into resonance during engine operation. Also, fatigue due to operation under resonance conditions is the usual mode of their failure. Because of the presence of the webs and crank pins it could be expected that bearings play an important role in determining even the torsion dominated natural frequencies. However, there do not appear to be any systematic study which brings out the interaction between bearing design parameters and the life of crankshafts. It also appears from the literature that bearings are routinely designed without considering their influence on the crankshaft dynamics. This study brings out the influence of radial and rotational stiff- nesses of bearings on the torsion dominated natural frequencies. It obtains the threshold values for the stiffnesses below which the nat- ural frequencies vary significantly with bering stiffnesses. It also demonstrates that the effect of wear of bearings, during their life time, on crankshaft natural frequencies, could be taken into account. Such design procedures could facilitate the development of reliable crankshafts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940698. (SP- 101 7) Parametric study of crankshaft natural frequencies. V. Prakash, Bharat Earth Movers Ltd.; M. R. Vadiraj, Intergraph Private Ltd.; and D. N. Venkatesh and U. Shrinivasa, Indian Institute of Science. Identification of natural frequencies is a fundamental step in crankshaft design. For satisfactory operation they should be well separated from the operating speed range and several of its harmon- ics. These frequencies depend on crankshaft's mounting conditions, its geometry and material properties. In this work ten crankshaft parameters are identified besides the bearing stiffness which can bring about changes in natural frequencies. The effect of variation of each of these parameters is studied. Also, the feasibility of using geometrically identical spheroidal graphite iron crankshaft in place of a forged one is examined from the point of view of natural fre- quencies. Three crankshafts are considered for the intended study. 940699. (SP- 101 7) Three dimensional crankshaft vibration analysis including gyroscopic effect. Chang-Seok Han, Kang-Woo Lee, Don-Boo Cho, Young-Jin Cheon, and Seung-Dong Yeo, Hyun- dai Motor Co. It has been recently reported that the crankshaft vibration pro- vides the main exciting source in the powertrain vibration. This paper presents the analytical method for the vibration of crankshaft by using the finite element method. The optimization process is employed so that the beam model of the crankshaft can have the same natural frequencies as those of solid model on the free-free condition. The mode analysis of the crankshaft whirling is made in the consideration of the gyroscopic effect and the changes of the nat- ural frequencies are also studied with the increase of the engine speed. Finally, the forced vibration of the crankshaft is solved on the time domain and the results are compared with those of the experimental measurements of bending moment by using the strain gage. This crankshaft system model can be used to analyze the forced vibration of the full powertrain as well. 940700. Cost effective molded polyurethane foam for auto- motive acoustical carpet underlay and dash insulators. David R. MacFarland, ICI Polyurethane s. NVH (Noise Vibration Harshness) control is receiving increased attention in the automotive industry, as the automotive engineers seek new ways to improve vehicle quality and customer satisfaction. Significant advances in cast (molded) polyurethane foam for automotive acoustical applications are increasing the cost competi- tiveness of this technology against more traditional sound deadening media, such as polyurethane slabstock foam (for dash insulators) and die-cut or molded resinated polyester waste fibers (''shoddy pads") for carpet underlay. This paper details these continuous improvements, which include density reduction without the use of any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) blowing agents from 5.0 pcf to 3.0 pcf, and demold time reduction for 5.0 minutes to 2.0 minutes for cycle time (productivity) improvements. While these advantages pertain to economics, advancing technology has also resulted in cast polyurethane systems meeting increasingly stringent physical prop- erty requirements, including heat and humid aged tensile strength, fogging and mildew resistance, without compromising acoustical performance. The economic impact of these developments will enable the automotive NVH engineering/design community to expand the use of cast acoustical polyurethane foam to a greater number of North American-built vehicles. 940701. Automotive demand, markets, and material selection processes. David J. Andrea and Brett C. Smith, University of Michi- gan. Cost reduction, quality improvement, and regulatory compliance are well-recognized competitive issues. Companies must excel along each of these fronts while operating in an environment of rapid and multi-faceted change, limited financial and human capital, and increasing product development time pressure. In addition, con- sumers are demanding automobiles that provide greater perfor- mance, function, and comfort while emitting lower emissions, con- suming fewer gallons of gasoline, injuring fewer humans, and requiring fewer dollars to build and purchase. A solution to these seemingly conflicting objectives is to take a systems view of the product and industry. This paper explores the material decision pro- cess so that manufacturers, component suppliers, and material pro- viders may better understand the interlocking web of compromises that shape the pursuit of value- added alternatives and avoidance of unprofitable compromises. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940702. LD-SRIM III: progress in lower density foam com- posites. Paul W. Mackey, ICI Polyurethane s. Low density structural RIM is a well established process that is used to make polyurethane foam matrix composites for automotive interior trim substrates. This technology has gained this position because these substrates are high in quality, durable, and most importantly, light weight. A vehicle equipped with low density structural RIM door panel substrates will save about 40% of the sub- strate weight, over one equipped with substrates made from thermo- plastics or other traditional materials. Low density reinforced RIM is an similar process that is used to make polyurethane foam matrix composites for interior trim substrates. These composites will save about 15% of a door panel substrate weight. Since saving weight is a goal for the automotive engineer, low density structural RIM sys- tems have been developed to produce even lighter weight compos- ites. This development yields composites with a specific gravity of 0.30 compared with composites currently employed which have a specific gravity of 0.60. These composites can save over 55% of the weight of a door panel substrate and reduce material cost. This paper 89</page><page sequence="89">940702-940708 describes the physical properties of these composites and demon- strates their utility as interior trim substrate, as well as comparing them to low density reinforced RIM materials. 940703. New developments in low density RIM composites for interior trim. Laura B. Weaver , Donald M. Ference, and Joseph J. Laux , Dow Chemical Co. The use of low density reinforced Reaction Injection Molded (RIM) substrates for covered interior automotive articles continues to increase globally. Reduced party mass, consolidation of manufac- turing steps (labor), and the use of aluminum tooling, instead of steel, are cited advantages that LD- RIM offers when compared to traditional wood based and thermoplastic materials. Two RIM processes are successfully being used to produce cov- ered interior door panels. Low density structural RIM (LD- RIM), utilizing conventional RIM equipment, involves the placement of a pre-cut fiberglass mat in the tool cavity prior to open-pour injection of the 2-stream liquid urethane components. Low density reinforced RIM (LD-RRIM), utilizing lance cylinder RIM equipment, incorpo- rates reinforcing fibers, such as milled fiberglass or wollastonite, in the liquid resin component. The liquid resin containing reinforcing filler is injected with the isocyanate component into a closed mold. Both LD-SRIM and LD- RRIM covered door panels meet OEM per- formance specifications. Little difference exists between LD-SRIM and LD-RRIM sub- strates, aside from tool design considerations and processing with either glass mat or reinforcing filler. In-mold polymer cure times and pressure/temperature profiles are essentially the same for both processes, and are dependent on the polyurethane components (i.e. polyol, catalysts, etc.) employed, polyurethane wall thickness, and polyurethane density. Aluminum production tools are preferred because: 1) the polyurethane substrates are "class B surfaces" and do not have the distinctness of image requirements which "class A" parts obtain from steel surfaces, 2) the low level of reinforcement (&lt;20 percent by weight of the substrate) is non-abrasive to the tool surface, and 3) the low tonnage (&lt;100 ton) RIM clamps which are used. Advancements have been made in LD-RIM substrates to reduce weight further, to proliferate the LD-RIM substrate to other automo- tive applications, to demonstrate the recyclability of both PVC cov- ered LD-SRIM and LD-RRIM substrates, and to impart "self- release" properties of the LD-RIM substrate from aluminum pro- duction tools. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940704. Advances in low-density RRIM foam for automotive interior trim. Michael P. Dempsey, Miles Inc.; Henry Mueller, Bayer AG; and Takanori Chiba, Sumitomo Bayer Urethane Co., Ltd. Low-density polyurethane RRIM has drawn increasing interest as a material option for automotive interior trim. Past systems have suffered from poor thermal stability and the need to mold thick, heavy parts to attain sufficient impact resistance. A new low-density polyurethane/polyurea RRIM system has been developed with improved thermal properties. This paper serves to outline the sys- tem's physical properties with particular emphasis on thermal and impact performance. System performance will be compared to other interior trim materials. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940705. Interior automotive plastic part testing. Cliff Brock- wcry, Blue Water Plastics, Inc.; Andy Mikloiche, General Motors Corp.; John Plomer, Dow Chemical Co.; and Gary Eaton, SAE. Late in 1992, it was recognized that the majority of the test meth- ods for evaluating interior plastic parts varied drastically between customers, often at great expense to the molder. There are tests requested that do not evaluate the interior part performance, while adding to the cost of testing. This paper describes the work conducted in developing a new SAE J 1 7 1 7 document that will allow O.E.M.'s to standardize test and evaluation methods and thereby minimize costly testing. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940706. Comparison of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polypropylene in automotive interior applications. Deborah J. Locke, GE Plastics. A study was conducted comparing the physical properties, adhe- sion capabilities, and impact performance of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polypropylene in a typical interior trim applica- tion. The results of this study showed that the ABS resins retained greater degree of their physical properties and exhibited greater low temperature impact resistance in a side collision than the tested polypropylene materials. Further testing demonstrated that, in gen- eral, untreated ABS possessed greater adhesive bond strength than did polypropylene, even after Corona discharge treatment. 940707. A comparison of polypropylene and ABS resins for automotive interior trim applications. Douglas Haberman and Timothy Brasei, Himont Inc. This paper compares the relevant properties of various materials currently used in automotive interior trim applications, including: general purpose Acrylonitrile- Butadiene-Styrene (ABS), High Heat ABS, Polypropylene copolymers (PP), and filled PP. The intent of this paper is to present comparisons that will assist material and design engineers when selecting materials for interior trim applica- tions. In addition, the paper discusses design issues that must be considered when converting between materials. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940708. Intrinsically foamed SMA in interior trim applica- tions. J. S. Gill, DSM Polymers; V. Härtel, Göppinger Kaliko GmbH; and H. G. Schoot, DSM Polymers. Co-polymers of styrene and maleic anhydride have been around since the '40' s. The addition of maleic anhydride to the polymer backbone has a two fold effect; firstly, it increases chain stiffness and secondly chain-chain interactions are increased. Both of these effects increase the glass transition temperature of the co-polymer. A production technology has been developed which enables to generate co-polymers containing a relatively high maleic anhydride content (typically up to 35 wt%) resulting in materials with glass transition temperatures up to 170°C. A technology has been discovered and patented whereby these high maleic anhydride containing co-polymers can, under the influ- ence of the right chemistry and temperatures (between 230 - 260/ mDC), release carbon dioxide which is then used as the blowing agent to generate low density (intrinsically blown) foams. In general these foams are produced on tandem foaming lines and typically have the following property profile: Temp, resistance -120-170°C; Density - 40 kg/m3; Open cell content - &lt;10%; weight - 200-240 g/m2; and Friability - comparable with other styrenie based foam systems. The advantages of SMA-foam produced by the intrinsic foaming technology are obvious: high temperature resistance, environmental friendly (no CFC or hydrocarbon emission), and low cost. Based on this intrinsically blown SMA foam, a new generation of headliners has been developed. The thermomechanical properties of these headliners are comparable to those of structures based on thermosetting polyurethane. The SMA used in the headliners can be recycled using a "solvent recycling" process. Due to the large segmental repulsion between the polar/a-polar monomer units SMA forms miscible or compatible blends with a large range of polymers or co-polymers, which effectively reduces this internal repulsion. Examples of polymers which are compatible with SMA are PMMA, SAN, PVC, PCL, ABS, PA and PET. This broad miscibility/compatibility range enhances options for recy- cling. 90</page><page sequence="90">940709-940714 940709. (SP- 1042) Trauma center based crash investigation research: methodologies and applications. Frances D. Bents, Dynamic Science, Inc.; Patricia C. Dischinger, University of Mary- land; and John H. Siegel, New Jersey Medical School. In recent years a new collaboration has been formed between highway safety researchers and the medical community. Both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have sponsored crash investigation studies in which accident reconstructionists work in conjunction with Level 1 Trauma Center staff. For the first time, the detailed analysis of crash circumstances and injury producing mechanisms is developed in concert with a forensic analysis of injury producing forces and tissue response. Long term patient outcome and rehabili- tation costs are also addressed. This paper compares the methodologies employed in this trauma based research with those of other major data systems. It describes the background and focus of each research program and addresses the data needs that can be met. 940710. (SP- 1042) Lower extremity trauma in vehicular front-seat occupants: patients admitted to a Level I trauma cen- ter. Patricia C. Dischninger, National Study Center for Trauma and EM; Andrew R. Burgess, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center; Brad M. Cushing and Timothy D. O 'Quinn, National Study Center for Trauma and EM; Carl B. Schmidhauser, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center; Shiu M. Ho, National Study Center for Trauma and EM; Paul J. Juliano, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center; and Frances D. Bents, Dynamic Science, Inc. Motor vehicle crashes are a major cause of lower extremity trauma, especially leg/foot fractures. Leg/foot fractures occur fre- quently, are costly, and often result in lifetime impairments. Although current information on the biomechanics of these injuries is limited. It is known that they occur more often in frontal motor vehicle collisions, and that vehicular intrusions of the toe pan and instrument panel have been implicated as possible causes. Current motor vehicle safety standards are designed to protect vehicle occu- pants from serious injury in collisions with a change in velocity (AV) of less than 30 mph. Preliminary evidence suggests that colli- sions resulting in these injuries may occur at delta V's well within the purview of current regulatory standards. This study was designed to develop a data collection instrument with which to capture detailed information on the crash reconstruc- tion, biomechanics, engineering, and orthopaedic aspects of leg/foot fractures. Data are being collected on patients admitted to a Level I trauma center so that postulates can be developed regarding mech- anisms of injury such as axial loading, translation, dorsiflexion, inversion, eversión, and bending. To be included in this study, the patient must have been a front seat occupant (restrained or unre- strained) of a late-model passenger vehicle or light truck/van involved in a collision, must not have been the victim of a rollover or ejection type crash, and must have sustained a lower extremity fracture distal to the femur. To date, data have been obtained for 42 trauma patients (22 men and 20 women). The mean Injury Severity Score for this group was 16, with an average of 2.2 lower extremity fractures distal to the femur per patient. The mean delta V was 28.4 mph (n = 39). Prelimi- nary findings, including postulated patterns for mechanism of injury, are described. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940711. (SP- 1042) Research program to investigate lower extremity injuries. Jeff R. Crandall, Stephen M. Klisch, Gregory S. Klopp, Edwin Sieveka, Walter D. Pilkey, and Peter martin, Uni- versity of Virginia. The University of Virginia is investigating the biomechanical response and the injury tolerance of the lower extremities. This paper presents the experimental and simulation work used to study the injury patterns and mechanisms of the ankle/foot complex. The simulation effort has developed a segmented lower limb and foot model for an occupant simulator program to study the interactions of the foot with intruding toepan and pedal components. The experi- mental procedures include static tests, pendulum impacts, and full- scale sled tests with the Advanced Anthropomorphic Test Device and human cadavers. In these tests, the response of the lower extremities is characterized with analogous dummy and cadaver instrumentation packages that include strain gauges, electrogonio- meters, angular rate sensors, accelerometers, and load cells. An external apparatus is applied to the surrogates lower extremities to simulate the effects of muscle tensing. Sled tests are performed with a toepan device that subjects the lower extremities to rotational, lon- gitudinal, and vertical intrusion pulses typical of offset vehicle crashes. Based upon data from the component and full-scale sled tests, a risk function which correlates observed cadaver injury with dummy responses is developed. 940712ģ (SP- 1042) The accident research unit Hannover as example for importance and benefit of existing in-depth investi- gations. Dietmar Otte, Medical University Hannover. The in-depth investigations of the Accident Research Unit Han- nover (Germany), which have been carried out since 1973 are described in the paper. The importance of the detailed analysis con- sists in the method, in the statistical approach and the continuous data collection over the years. The government as well as industrial manufacturers use this data. Since 1985 a statistical procedure including a mathematical weighing procedure has been applied. About 1,000 cases per year are collected. In the paper, principal aspects in the technique of data collection, definitions of variables and possibilities of data usage are described. The limitations of in-depth investigations are discussed in principle, and demands for a worldwide level are pointed out. 940714. (SP- 1042) Airbag protected crash victims - The chal- lenge of identifying occult injuries. Jeffrey S. Augenstein, Univer- sity of Miami; Kennerly H. Digges, George Washington Univ.; Louis V. Lombardo, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion; Elana B. Perdeck, University of Miami; James E. Stratton, Arvin Caslspan Corp.; A. C. Malliaris, Data Link, Inc.; and Patricia M. Byers, Diego B. Nunez, Jr., Gergory A. Zych, Jonathan Andron, A. Kevin Craythorne, and Carla Verga, University of Miami. A multidisciplinary, automobile crash investigation team at the Jackson Memorial Hospital/Ryder Trauma Center in Miami, Flor- ida, is conducting detailed medical and engineering study. The focus is restrained (seatbelts and/or airbag) occupants involved in frontal crashes, who have also been severely injured. More than 60 crashes have been included in the study to date. Analysis of the initial data indicates that restraint systems are working to reduce many of the head and chest injuries which unre- strained occupants suffer. However, internal injuries among airbag-protected occupants may be unrecognized in the field providing new challenges in triage and injury diagnosis. In other cases, survival in extremely high severity crashes presents trauma management challenges due to the extent and complexity of the multiple injuries which result. The paper provides case examples to illustrate types of chest and abdom- inal injuries associated with airbag cases. Three types of cases are presented: (1) Jackson Study Involving Occult Chest/Abdominal Injury, (2) National Accident Sampling System (NASS) Special Crash Investigation (SCI) and (3) Jackson Study Involving Crash Severities Greater than 45 MPH. To assist in recognizing the extent of injuries to occupants pro- tected by airbags, it is suggested that additional evidence from the crash scene be used in the triage criteria. For the occult chest/ abdominal cases observed in the Jackson study, deformation of the steering system was the vehicle characteristic most frequently observed. The challenges of recognizing injuries to airbag-protected occu- pants are discussed. The presence of steering wheel deformation may be a sufficient signal of caution to justify transporting the 91</page><page sequence="91">940714-940725 injured victim to a Level 1 or 2 trauma center so that a close exami- nation for occult injuries can be made. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940716. Upper extremity injuries related to air bag deploy- ments. Donald F. Huelke, Jamie L. Moore , and Timothy W. Comp- ton, University of Michigan; and Jonathan Samuels , and Robert S. Levine, Wayne State Univ. From our crash investigations of air bag equipped passengers cars, a subset of upper extremity injuries are presented that are related to air bag deployments. Minor hand, wrist or forearm inju- ries-contusions, abrasions, and sprains are not uncommonly reported. Infrequently, hand fractures have been sustained and, in isolated cases, fractures of the forearm bones or of the thumb and/or adjacent hand. The close proximity of the forearm or hand to the air bag module door is related to most of the fractures identified. Steer- ing wheel air bag deployments can fling the hand-forearm into the instrument panel, rearview mirror or windshield as indicated by con- tact scuffs or tissue debris or the star burst (spider web) pattern of windshield breakage in front of the steering wheel. 940719. (SP- 1030) Use of Monte Carlo simulation techniques in accident reconstruction. Garrison Kost and Stephen M. Werner, Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. This paper describes a straight-forward, automated approach to performing sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation tech- niques. Probability distributions are assigned to key input parame- ters, and results are expressed in the form of probability distribu- tions of each of the desired output parameters. With this technique, it is possible to obtain quantitative results regarding the probability of results being within selected ranges. The approach is fast and automated, and provides a rational basis for dealing with uncertainty and ranges of parameters in accident reconstruction analyses. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940720. (SP- 1030) Monte Carlo simulation methods applied to accident reconstruction and avoidance analysis. Denis P. Wood and Sean O'Riordain, Wood &amp; Associates. When reconstructing vehicle accidents it is necessary in the course of the analysis to account for the uncertainty in the values of the key parameters such as tire to road adhesion, the direction of vehicle movement both pre- and post-impact etc. In this paper Monte Carlo simulation methods are applied to accident reconstruc- tion and accident avoidance analysis. Also the benefits which can be obtained from redundancy of the relationships describing the par- ticular accident are examined. The results which can be obtained are demonstrated by a number of case studies. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940721. (SP- 1030) A rule based system for accident recon- struction. Frank Navin, University of British Columbia; and Karoly Krajczar, Greater Vancouver Regional District. Motor vehicle accidents are often difficult to resolve since the data is conflicting and of questionable validity. Conventional analy- sis requires a great deal of expertise on the part of the accident inves- tigator. Problems that are conceptual and cannot be reduced to num- bers can often be solved using expert system technology. KAR is a prototype rule based Knowledge-based Accident Reconstruction system used at the initial stage of an investigation. The program is capable of calculating vehicle speeds using any combination of the following techniques: skid, roll, overturn, yaw, vault, momentum and energy. The system's most notable feature is its interpretive abilities. The program is able to determine how to solve the mechanics of the accident, and verifies the evidence before it uses a particular method in the calculations. Additionally, an inter- active explanation facility allows the user to examine the program's reasoning. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940722. (SP- 1030) Uncertainty in accident reconstruction cal- culations. Raymond M. Brach, University of Notre Dame. The problem of determining the uncertainty in the result of a for- mula evaluation is addressed. The origin of the uncertainty is the presence of variations in the input variables. Three popular tech- niques are discussed in the context of accident reconstruction. The first establishes upper and lower bounds through calculation of the largest and smallest possible values of the quantity being estimated for all combinations of the input variables. The second method used differential calculus and places variations of the variables into a delta equation derived from the mathematical formula. The last method covers cases where statistical information about the input data is known. Approximate means and variances are developed for linear and nonlinear formulas. Examples are given for all of the methods, such as calculation of speed from skid distance and calcu- lation of stopping distance including perception-decision-reaction (PDR) time. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940723. (SP- 1030) Braking and cornering effects with and without anti-lock brakes. Richard F. Lambourn, Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory. The results of three inquiries of relevance to accident reconstruc- tion are given. In the first the difference between anti-lock and locked-wheel braking on a dry surface is examined, with the finding that average decelerations with anti-lock are about 12% higher. In the second the effect of anti-lock operation on the curved yaw-mark method of speed calculation is explored; the finding is that the method is still valid, although it is possible that there is a greater ten- dency towards underestimation. The third inquiry is into the appear- ance and enhancement of tire marks from anti-lock braking, where it is found that marks are infrequently made; they are more likely to be found on uneven surfaces, and while faintly visible marks can sometimes be seen more easily with polarized light, no way has been found of developing invisible or latent marks. 940724. (SP- 1030) Ice, ABS, &amp; temperature. Ross Eddie, C.R. Eddie Engineering Inc. To examine the effect of anti-lock brakes with summer, all- sea- son, and winter type tires on ice and snow, tests were carried out on a flooded frozen track and on asphaltic pavement with newly fallen snow. The friction values obtained were compared with those reported by other investigators. The most important factor governing the amount of traction on snow or ice was the temperature of the tire/snow/ice interface at the time of the test. The same tires on the same surface produced twice as much or half as much traction during tests done later after the temperature had changed. Surface roughness was also a significant factor. Overall, decelerations ranged from 0.10 g to 0.30 g. This is con- sistent with the majority of earlier published data. Directional control was often lost during test with the anti- lock brake system inactive. Control was never lost during tests with the anti-lock brake system active. Under most circumstances the anti- lock brake system offered a slight advantage providing greater deceleration than was recorded in tests with the anti- lock system inactive. With fresh snow on pavement and a temperature just below freezing, somewhat better traction was obtained with the anti-lock brake system inactive. On smooth surfaces of ice or hard packed snow the winter, all weather, and summer tires had very similar traction. Any possible differences in deceleration were masked by variations attributable to changes in surface temperature. Snow tires gave the best traction in loose snow. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940725. (SP- 1026) Intentional acts of violence in motor vehi- cles: suicide and murder. Wilton D. Nelson, Livingston County Sheriff's Department. 92</page><page sequence="92">940725-940732 Many fatal vehicle crashes are intentional acts to cover an act of suicide or murder. Some experts estimate that this total can be as large as 10% to 25% of all motor vehicle fatals. The stigma attached to suicide causes families to conceal the details, notes, threats, etc. to authorities. Today's society takes vehicle accidents as a matter of fact and injuries resulting from them. Consequently, a staged crash is not always examined in detail to determine the causal fac- tors which include murder. This is particularly true of single vehicle crashes in which the driver, the only occupant, is dead. Police may assume that since the deceased brought about their own demise that no additional investigation is necessary. The unfortunate result of reporting these incidents as "accidents" results in inappropriate insurance payouts which affect rates and inflate the fatal statistics that are used to enact vehicle regulations. The latter can increase the manufacturing costs of vehicles. The objective of this paper is to make the public aware of the use of a motor vehicle as a means of self destruction and murder by describing a number of actual events. Unfortunately, in most cases public recognition of the intentional act will be after the event has occurred. Insurance carriers and vehicle crash data collectors need to be able to identify and separate these events from their "accident " files. Hopefully, identifying the profiles of suicidal drivers may also lead to the appropriate medical and psychological treatments needed to save the lives of some symptomatic individuals. 940726. (SP- 1030) Time-position-visibility analysis: a graphi- cal approach. Kenneth G. Sorenson, Invetech, Inc. Reconstruction of vehicular accidents frequently involves devel- oping an understanding of time-position relationships - "who was where when", position-visibility relationships -- "who could see what from where", and time-position- visibility relationships - "who could see what from where when". A spreadsheet calculation is used to generate the pre-impact time- position history for vehicles traveling along known paths at known or estimated speeds. The position-visibility relationship is determined either by direct mea- surements at the site, or by measurements from a scale site diagram, or both. A spreadsheet/graphical analysis combines the position- visibility and time-position results into a time-position-visibility presentation format which is used both for analysis and for presenta- tion of results. This technique is particularly well suited to perform- ing sensitivity analyses to explore the effects of uncertainties in vehicle speeds and approach paths. 940727. (SP- 1032) Improvement in pitting resistance of transmission gears by plasma carburizing process. Toshimitsu Kimura and Atsumi Hatano, Daido Steel Co., Ltd.; and Noriko Uchiyama, M akoto Yoshida, and Shinji Asano, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The application of both high strength gear steels and shot peen- ing technology has succeeded in strengthening automotive transmis- sion gears. This technology, though, improves mainly the fatigue strength at the tooth root, but not the pitting property at the tooth face. Therefore, demand has moved to the development of new gear steels with good pitting resistance. In order to improve pitting resistance, the authors studied super carburizing which is characterized by carbide dispersion in the case, especially processed with a plasma carburizing furnace. Firstly, the influence of the carburizing temperature and carburizing period on the carbide morphology was investigated and the optimum carburiz- ing conditions were determined. Secondly, the fatigue strength and pitting resistance was evaluated using carbide dispersed specimens. Gear fatigue tests and roller pitting tests show that the 0. 18%C-0. 5%Si-0.3%Mn-2.25%Cr-0.4%Mo steel super carburized by the plasma carburizing furnace and shot peened has a better pitting resistance than gears conventionally gas carburized and shot peened. Furthermore, as revealed by a gear pitting test that simulates real transmission, the combination of the steel and the process shows good pitting durability. 940728. (SP- 1032) Fighting debris: long life HTF bearings for transmissions. Michael R. Beerbower, NSK Corp.; and Takaaki Shirantani, Yasuo Nurakami, and Kenichi Abe, NSK Ltd. Lubricant contamination is a frequent hazard to bearing life in automotive transmission. The "sealed clean" bearing concept uses dynamic, rubber seals to exclude significant contamination from transmission bearings. However there is often insufficient space in a roller bearing application to accommodate seals. HTF steel speci- fications and processing were developed for such applications. Debris within a rotating bearing will create indentations in the raceway. Contact stress is concentrated at the indentation edges and fatigue damage is accelerated. A indentation's diameter and edge radius determine the stress concentration between the ball and race- way. The HTF steel specification and tightly controlled heat treat- ment processing have been developed to provide long life despite the contamination hazard. Testing confirms the effectiveness of the new material. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940729. (SP- 1032) Effects of shot peening and grinding on gear strength. Toru Sakurada and Motokazu Kobayashi, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. In recent years, higher strength for truck and bus transmission gear has become necessary. For the transmission gears, carburized gears have generally been used. We have examined the effects of shot peening and grinding using a CBN grindstone on the pitting strength and the bending fatigue strength of a carburized gear, and further evaluated a material which reduces the structural anomalies produced during carburization. As a result, it has been found that shot peening or CBN grinding is more effective for improving both pitting strength and bending fatigue strength than improving the material composition. Therefore, it is evident that residual compressive stress caused by shot peening or CBN grinding suppresses the propagation of cracks. 940730. (SP- 1032) Effect of overrunning speed and plate gap on power dissipation in MD type one way clutches. Frank L. Fitz, James Blum, and Paul Pires, Epilogics, Inc. The Mechanical Diode one way clutch was developed as a high strength alternative to roller ramp and sprag clutches where high torque or limited space are overriding considerations. The planar ratchet design of the MD is ideal for providing single or dual one way functions with minimal axial space required. This paper presents an evaluation of the MD's overrunning char- acteristics. MD's of various sizes and with varied internal gap geom- etry have been overrun at speeds between 1,000 and 11,000 rpm. Speeds, overrunning torques and lubricant temperatures are recorded and overrunning power dissipation characteristics of MD's are presented in tabular and graphic form. 940731. (SP- 1032) Development of brazing method with arc- sprayed coatings and application to torque converter. Toshikuni Kusano, Ryuichi Uchino, and Takaaki Nakano, Aisen Seiki Co., Ltd. Brazing using arc-sprayed coatings was investigated for applica- tion to non-oxidation copper brazing. It was found that the more porous sprayed coatings have an excellent brazeability. This newly developed joining method is more suitable than conventional meth- ods for brazing complicated parts. We have applied this method to fabricate a torque converter for practical use. 940732. (SP- 1032) Characterization of semi-float axle shaft bending fractures. Gregory A. Fett, Dana Corp. Semi-float rear axles are used today throughout the world on most passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, and many light trucks. The axle shaft in the semi-float axle assembly serves two functions; to transmit torque, and to carry the vehicle weight. The shafts are typically conservative in design and extremely reliable. However, they will occasionally fracture by bending overload as a result of an accident such as side impact with another vehicle or obstacle, or a 93</page><page sequence="93">940732-940739 rollover situation. These fractures have been, on occasion, grossly mischaracterized leading to an erroneous conclusion as to the cause of an accident. It is the intent of this work to serve as a guide in rec- ognizing the cause of bending fractures that may occur in this type axle shaft. Fortunately, these fractures are easy to identify and the information they provide is absolutely reliable. 940733. (SP- 1032) Advanced development of self-controlled torque sensitive limited-slip differential by means of helical gears. W. Rohregger, GKN Viscodrive GmbH ; P. Amborn, GKN Automotive AG; and O. A. Kaufmann, GKN Viscodrive GmbH. This paper compares and contrasts several types of torque- sensi- tive limited slip differential designs while focusing on the self- controlled helical gear differential. Cone- and plate-type locking dif- ferentials in common use today offer a low production cost but tend to change locking characteristics as they wear and influence vehicle handling and braking. Current worm gear type limited slip differen- tials present a disadvantage in that they have a limited range of available locking ratios as a function of cost and also present long- term durability issues. Thus, attention has turned in recent years to the self-controlled helical gear approach. This method offers a wide range of locking ratios thus making it possible to tune the perfor- mance of the differential to match virtually any vehicle. Applica- tions involving use of this design as a rear wheel differential and as a center differential are described. Uneven distribution of torque is often desirable in a center differential and the design principles involved in achieving this effect are explained., Finally, a test rig was developed to measure the locking effect and service life of the helical gear differential and it showed that these devices maintain consistent performance over their service life, as compared to cur- rent torque sensitive devices. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940734.

(SP- 1032) A study on a metal pushing V-belt type CVT. Shigeru Kanehara, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Toru Fujii and Takashi Kitagawa, Dos his ha Univ. Block compression force and ring tension of a metal pushing V- belt type CVT have been experimentally measured at steady states. The peculiar transmitting mechanisms for this type of belts has also been outlined based on the experimental results in the previous works. In this paper, other forces simultaneously acting on a block at steady states were measured using newly developed devised blocks. These forces are frictional force between blocks and rings, normal force between blocks and pulleys, frictional forces between blocks and pulleys in radial and tangential directions. The transmitting mechanisms for the metal pushing V-belt type CVT were drawn in detail based on new experiment data. The following conclusions are emphasized in the present work. (1) A cohesive point where the block coheres with the ring exists in the pulley having a larger pitch radius at all conditions. This is not dependent on speed ratio and transmitting torque. The all blocks run faster than rings in the smaller pulley. This fact governs the ring tension. (2) The phenomenon that the block compression force once increases in the driven pulley is due to penetration of blocks into the pulley groove. (3) The radial frictional force becomes extremely large at the exit of the larger pulley since the normal force acting on the side surface of the block becomes large there. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940736.

(SP- 1032) The Jaguar XJ220 triple-cone synchronizer - A case study. Lee M. Sykes, FF Developments. AS befits such a prestigious vehicle, the transmission shift sys- tem of the Jaguar XJ220 supercar requires 'state-of-the-art' perfor- mance, with particular emphasis on low effort, minimal travel and positive feel. To meet these targets, a high capacity triple-cone syn- chronizer is specified for both First and second gears. The design of this new synchronizer system is discussed, together with a review of the analysis, testing and development undertaken to achieve a successful and reliable solution. This success is measured by favor- able vehicle reviews noting the 'superb' gearchange. Additionally, the reliability of the synchronizer system, and the transmission as a whole, was further demonstrated when an XJ220 won the GT class in the 1993 Le Mans 24 hours endurance race. 940738. (SP- 1043) Collection of exhaust hydrocarbons by a heated stainless steel canister and a heated stainless steel syringe. Ken-ichi Akiyama, Japan Automobile Research Institute, Inc. and Saitama Univ. Gas collection techniques for determining in hydrocarbons (HCs) in automotive exhaust are discussed. Stability of HCs in a Tediar bag (3L) is cleared on this study. C7-C12 alkanes storaged in the Tediar bag were lower than correct value by adsorption on bag surface. HCs storaged in the Tediar bag were higher than correct value by condensation of water vapor immediately after sampling. Sampling techniques of vehicle exhaust gases that can be getting reliablity must satisfy a number of requirements. It needs to retain the components in exhaust gases for several hours, without photo chemical reactions, and to collect it at a constant speed. Sampling method, therefore, both with a heated stainless steel canister and with a sampling method with a heated stainless steel syringe were developed to satisfy these requirements. In the heated stainless steel canister, C7-C12 alkanes were stable for 1 hour and water vapor was stable for 10 minutes at 120°C, and in the heated stainless steel syringe, these were stable for 3 hours at 120°C. The flow rate of exhaust gas collected into the heated stainless steel canister was stable from 15 seconds to end. The flow rate of exhaust gas collected into the heated stainless steel syringe was constant. 940739. (SP- 1043) Modal measurements of some important NMOG species by FT-IR spectroscopy. Jay P. Roberts and S. R. Lowry, Nicolet Instrument Corp. The EPA and the State of California are phasing in tighter emis- sions requirements for hydrocarbons. Designing emissions control systems to meet these standards requires detailed information of the composition of the exhaust stream. Of particular interest is the abil- ity to determine non-methane organic gases (NMOG) to meet reac- tivity index (RI) specifications. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is a technique widely used to measure organic compounds. Many NMOG com- pounds have unique infrared signatures that can be speciated by FT-IR. Because FT-IR can analyze samples in real time, the effects 94</page><page sequence="94">940739-940746 of driving cycle events such as the cold start and acceleration modes may be studied. This paper gives a brief overview of the new regulations being phased in for hydrocarbons, as well as the techniques currently used for these measurement. FT-IR instrumentation and sampling tech- niques for exhaust gas analysis are explained. A discussion of the different gases which may be analyzed by FT-IR is presented, with the gases divided into their functional groups. Finally, the capabili- ties and limitations of FT-IR will be summarized. 940740. (SP- 1043) A comparison of gas chromatography- based methods of analyzing hydrocarbon species.

The main methods compared were a Tenax cold trap injection (TCT) method (C5-C12 HCs) and a cold trap injection (CTI) method (C2-C4 HCs; C5-C12 HCs). Our own direct (DIR) method was used to confirm the collection efficiencies. Both methods yielded good results, but the CTI method showed low collection efficiency for some C2-C4 HCs. Measurement of individual species is needed with this method for accurate analysis of tailpipe emis- sions. Both the CTI method and the TCT method combined with the DIR method for determining C2-C4 HCs yielded nearly the same ozone specific reactivity values for the NMHC species analyzed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940741. (SP- 1043) Particulate matter emissions, analysis by means of a sampling sonde technique. Rogelio Gonzálex-Oropeza and Alejandro F. Romero-López, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Even though the method described here could not at all be con- sidered as an alternative to the Federal Test Procedures (FTP), speci- fied by the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 40, Protection of the Environment), a sampling sonde technique (SST) is proposed for particulate matter generation (PMG) analysis. Since this procedure is not accepted by the main regulatory agencies, it can, however, be used to give a reasonable indication of the main characteristics of PMG in diesel engines. An experimental set up is briefly described along with the main results of the analysis. An emphasis is made on some performance conditions that induce a reduction of PMG, when the internal design parameters of the engine can not be changed. The parameters that were changed and subject to experimentation were engine speed and load, and injection timing. 940742. (SP- 1043) Analysis of the FTP performance of metal foil and ceramic substrate catalytic converters using statistical methods. Joseph V. Bonadies, AC Rochester. A designed experiment was conducted to determine the effects of varying noble metal concentration, converter volume, substrate material, aging schedule, and performance engine on FTP effi- ciency. Sixteen catalytic converters of common containment and washcoat technology were aged and evaluated on 3.8L and 5.7L engine dynamometers using the cold start FTP as the performance test. Gaseous conversion efficiencies for Cycle 2 (light-off), Phase 2 (steady state), and End of Test Summary are compared for the five main factors and their interactions. 940743. (SP- 1043) Optimization of catalytic converter loca- tion achieved with a curve catalytic honeycomb substrate. Mitsuyoshi Hattori and Gayu U esugi, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; and Minoru Machida, NGK Insulators, Ltd. A new type of catalytic converter has been developed for the coming TLEV (Transitional Low Emission Vehicle) standards. It is a "Front Curve Catalytic Converter (FCCC)" using a curved cordi- erite ceramic honeycomb substrate. During this development, an optimum location and volume of the front curve catalytic converter were determined from the view points of thermal deterioration of the catalyst and hydrocarbon con- version performance. Based on CAE (Compute Aided Engineering) analysis, the best curvature radius of the substrate was selected to minimize a pressure drop of the front curve catalytic converter. The emission conversion and light-off performances of the front curve catalytic converter were compared with a conventional straight design. A series of durability tests; hot vibration, engine dynamome- ter and vehicle fleet tests were also conducted to confirm the reli- ability of the new front curve catalytic converter. This paper discusses the details of the development conducted by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and NGK Insulators, Ltd. 940744. (SP- 1043) Design considerations for a ceramic pre- converter system. S. T. Gulati, S. Socha, and P. M. Then, Corning Inc.; and P. D. Stroom, 3 M Co. The preconverter is an essential element of exhaust gas treatment to help meet the tighter emission standards of TLEV and LEV levels. Its design must be chosen so as to meet the simultaneous requirements of compactness, faster light-off, low back pressure, high temperature durability and low cost. This paper presents design options for a ceramic substrate and durable package which leads to an optimum and cost-effective preconverter system. Preliminary data for high temperature physical durability of selected converter systems are presented. Performance parameters for light-off activity and back pressure are also computed and compared with those of standard substrates used in underbody application. Laboratory tests comprising of axial push-out test, high temperature vibration tests, exhaust gas simulation test and the engine dynamometer test demon- strate the viability of ceramic preconverters for automotive applica- tion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940745. (SP- 1043) The effect of lubricant phosphorus level on exhaust emissions in a field trial of gasoline engine vehicles. Carol Drury and Scott Whitehouse, Shell Canada Ltd. The objective was to evaluate the effect of lubricant phosphorus level on catalyst converter efficiencies in a range of modern gasoline engines. Six pairs of late model (1991 and 1992) cars were purchased for the trial. The lubricants were premium quality 5W-30 oils differing only in the level of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), in that one oil contained 0.12% mass phosphorus and the other oil contained 0.05% mass phosphorus. The cars were driven on local roads in a specified route of mixed conditions. The exhaust emission were measured at 4,000, 40,000 and 80,000 km using the standard FTP 75 cycle. Oil samples were taken at 6,000 km intervals and the oil was changed at 12,000 km intervals. At 80,000 km there was no significant lubricant effect on catalyst efficiency. Three pairs of vehicles from this trial are continuing on to 120, 000 km. In addition, the results from this field trial will be integrated with data from concurrent trials in the U.K. and Germany. Final results will be available later in 1994. 940746. (SP- 1043) Engine oil additive effects on deactivation of monolithic three-way catalysts and oxygen sensors. Fumio Ueda, Shinichi Sugiyama, Kazutaka Arimura, Shigeki Hamaguchi, and Kenyu Akiyama, Toyota Motor Corp. It is widely known that pellet-typed catalysts are deactivated by phosphorus (ZnDTP) that comes from engine oils. In this paper, the poisoning of monolithic three-way catalysts and oxygen sensors by engine oils is studied. First, catalysts and oxygen sensors were poi- soned on the engine bench by test oils in which the quantity of phos- phorus and ash was varied. Next, performance of the catalysts and sensors alone was examined and the vehicle exhaust emission at FTP mode was measured on a chassis dynamometer. The results indicate that phosphorus in engine oils poisons the monolithic cata- lyst and the oxygen sensor resulting in deterioration of the vehicle 95</page><page sequence="95">940746-940753 NOx exhaust emission. However, Ca sulfonate and Mg sulfonate detergents act by restraining phosphorus poisoning of the catalyst and the oxygen sensor. Through analysis of the catalyst and sensor surfaces, it is con- cluded that phosphorus poisons the catalyst and sensor forming a dense coating. But Ca and Mg prevent phosphorus from adhering to the catalysts and the sensors and from forming in the dense coat- ing. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940747. (SP- 1043) The physical and chemical effect of man- ganese oxides on automobile catalytic converters. Allen A. Aradi, Joseph W. Roos, Ben F. Fort, Jr., Thomas E. Lee, and Robert /. Davidson, Ethyl Corp. Manganese oxide deposits which are exclusively in the form of Mn3Û4, a benign form of manganese, are introduced in the exhaust stream from sue of MMT, an octane-enhancing, emission- reducing fuel additive. The physical and chemical effect of these deposits on catalytic converters has generated some controversy in the literature. In this paper, we will focus on the effects that manganese oxide deposits have on catalytic converters. The physical effect of these deposits on the morphology of the converters was investigated by B.E.T. surface area measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x-ray fluorescence (XRF). The chemical effect was investigated with tests using both slave- engine dynamometers and a pulse-flame combustor to probe for differences in catalyst perfor- mance. Data from an extensive vehicle fleet which was tested according to a program designed in consultation with the EPA and the automo- bile industry will be presented. The automobiles were paired so that one was assigned to clear fuel and its partner to the same fuel with the HiTEC 3000 additive. These automobiles were equipped with three-way catalytic converters with Pt/Rh as the active metals. Each vehicle operated over 75,000 miles, with FTP tests carried out at intervals of 5,000 miles. Emissions data from this fleet have previ- ously been presented. Additionally, six 1911 Ford Escorts were sim- ilarly tested to 24,000 miles. The catalysts in the 1991 Escorts had Pd/Rh as the active metals. Our results clearly show that the manganese oxides deposits on catalytic converters: 1) do not adversely affect performance; 2) do not adversely affect the surface area of the catalysts; and 3) inhibit the deposition of catalyst poisons such as phosphorus and zinc on the catalyst surface. 940748. (SP- 1021) Using a geometric toolkit to link finite ele- ment calculations in sheet metal forming analysis. Kito-Kuang Ghen and Michael P. Campabell, General Motors Corp. Sheet metal forming of automobile body panel consists of two processes performed in series: binder forming and punch forming. Due to differences in deformation characteristics of the two forming processes, their analysis methods are different. The binder wrap sur- face shape and formed part shape are calculated using different mathematical models and different finite element codes, e.g., WRAPFORM and PANELFORM, respectively. The output of the binder forming analysis may not be directly applicable to the subsequent punch forming analysis. Interpolation, or approximation, of the calculated binder wrap surface geometry is needed. This surface representation requirement is carried out using computer aided geometric design tools. This paper discusses the use of such a tool, SURFPLAN, to link WRAPFORM and PANELFORM calculations. By SURFPLAN, an interpolated Bezier surface and an approximated C1 smooth Bezier surface are obtained based on the WRAPFORM calculated node points on the binder wrap surface. The approximated binder wrap surface geome- try is used in punch forming analysis by PANELFORM. Two exam- ples are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940749. (SP- 1021) Predicting forming limit diagrams with explicit and implicit finite element codes. Mark F. Horstemeyer, Mike L. Chiesa, and Doug J. Bammann, Sandia National Laborato- ries. An internal state variable plasticity/damage model was employed in explicit and implicit finite element codes to predict forming limit diagrams. The finite element analyses showed that either the explicit or implicit methods can be used to determine sheet metal thickness effects, temperature and rate effects, and loading history effects. A novel way of introducing instability was introduced by different ini- tial void volume fractions in neighboring materials. Shell elements can be used to shorten cpu times, given that shell bending assump- tions are not violated. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940750. (SP- 1021) An approach for designing out surface defects in metal stampings. Jacek Kołodziejski, Ahmad Assemp- oor, and Sheng-Dong Liu, Forming Technologies Incorporated. Surface defects occur during forming, material unloading and during further material processing. During forming operations the compressive forming stresses are the cause of defects. During mate- rial unloading and further material processing, springback and resid- ual stresses are the major cause of such defects. The conditions for the occurrence of surface defects at these three stages are examined and discussed. A computer aided method- ology is presented for estimation of the residual stresses, application of the approach is given for some practical examples. 940752. (SP- 1021) On the use of a computerized tool kit as an analysis aid for product and process design of clamshell heat exchangers. Pratip Dastidar, Carrier Corp.; and Taher Aboutour, Forming Technologies Incorporated. The paper illustrates the application of a tool kit of computer pro- grams to evaluate possible process designs and tooling details for clamshell type heat exchangers. The work demonstrates modeling rules for analyzing local, regional and global features of a complex stamping. Local analysis is performed on each critical area using the plane strain and axisymmetric approximations as well as a three dimen- sional model of the beads. Global three dimensional models are then used to investigate interactions between main features. The forming forces, flywheel energy and out-of-balance forces required to select the press are evaluated. It is shown that the design and analysis programs within the tool kit are complementary to each other; each providing a different information perspective, each satisfying different lead time and accuracy requirements to address design and analysis needs. The ability of comparing solutions from the different computer tools is an excellent way of building confidence when using computer aided tools in a production environment. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940753. (SP- 1021) Stamping and hydroforming process simu- lations with a 3D finite element code. Chi-Mou Ni, General Motors Corp. In the automotive industry, the finite element analysis (FEA) has been extensively used in metal forming process simulations during recent years. A number of papers have been published to document these progresses, especially for the 2D applications. Up to very recent years, due to the advent of high speed computers, the use of 3D finite element codes to model complex sheet metal forming and hydroforming processes has become possible. This paper is intended to present some of the applications using a commercial 3D finite ele- ment code, DYNA3D, to production-type stamping and hydroform- ing process simulations. The modeling methodology and some of the correlations between models and experimental measurements are given herein. Also, the benefits of using the FEA process simula- tion at the early stage of the product developments are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 96</page><page sequence="96">940754-940759 940754. (SP- 1021) Transformation of stamping part profiles to roller profiles. Z T. Zhang, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and S. M. Panton and J. L. Duncan , University of Auckland. An important extension to the process of roll forming is the pro- duction of embossments by a secondary stamping operation. In this paper, a system is described for transforming stamping profiles to roller profiles, thus eliminating the need for the secondary stamping operation. Included in the system are techniques for identifying and avoiding interference between the rollers, and for calculating torque and power requirements. The system is illustrated by describing how the process was used to design a pair of rollers for embossing a profile generated by the LaBarge method. 940755. (SP- 1021) Sheet metal forming simulation, methodol- ogy and material data base issues. R. El Khaldi, Engineering Sys- tems International; S. Tasaka, IBM Japan Ltd.; and F. Hatt, Engi- neering Systems International. The mass production of sheet metal stamped parts is a very well established technology, supported to a large degree by the practical experience and know-how of tool and die engineers. Often, die try- out involves several iterations, before an acceptable part quality is reached. Previous experience from the manufacture of similar parts plays an important role. However, with today's requirements for the use of new material (aluminum, laminated steel, etc.) as well as the strong demand for new product shapes (exterior automotive body parts), these traditional techniques are challenged to their limit. A number of successful attempts have been made towards simu- lating the sheet metal forming process by the finite element method. The earliest were based on the membrane formulation or used 2-D analysis assumptions. Following initially promising results, subse- quent efforts have been made to develop 3-D simulation codes using implicit techniques. However, major difficulties arose, among them: dealing with the large number of elements required to correctly cap- ture material flow, the resulting memory requirements for solving the simultaneous equations, convergence problems for contact and constitutive algorithms, etc. After the very successful industrial application of explicit codes for simulating crash events in the transportation industry, similar technology has been utilized towards simulating sheet forming pro- cesses. These applications document the potential impact of such numerical tools on the stamped part design and production process, shortening the design period and resulting in cost reductions. How- ever, until now, not enough attention has been paid to the material data base issue, because the priority had to be given to proving the feasibility of such applications. Today, the key issues are accurate material data bases in addition to quick tool surface meshing capa- bilities. 940756. (SP- 1021) An industrial application of sheet metal forming simulation. A. Heath, B. Eisner , and K. von Versen, Engi- neering System International GmbH; and H. Blodt, General Motors Technical Development Center Europe. A simulation study is described which aided the planning of an industrial sheet metal forming process for the manufacture of an automotive suspension housing. Various alternative process designs were evaluated using an explicit finite element technique. The simu- lation results suggested that the component would have to be drawn in two stages, which was successfully applied in production. Subse- quent trials confirmed the predictions of the simulations and are also presented in the paper. 940757. (SP- 1021) Structural performance and weight reduc- tion of steel, aluminum and stampable sheet for bumper beams. Takao Mori, Hidemitsu Hamano, and Koji Suzuki, NKK Corp. This paper presents the results of experimental analysis on the structural performance of steel, aluminum alloy and stampable sheets for bumper beams and the calculation results on the weight reduction of those bumper beams. Bending tests of straight beams, which were made of the three kinds of materials, were carried out in order to examine their struc- tural performance. In consideration of failure modes, it was found that the maximum load and the absorbed energy of those beams can be evaluated by their material strength, their side- wall thickness and the height of their cross sections. Based on this evaluation method, the weight and the absorbed energy of the constant displacement were calculated using a common cross section. The weight reduc- tion of aluminum alloy and stampable sheets is superior to 590MPa high tensile strength steel sheets. However, it was verified that applying ultra high tensile strength steel sheets can be equalized to the weights of aluminum alloy and stampable sheets. 940758. A preliminary study of chemically enhances autoignition in an internal combustion engine. Jiang Lu and Ash- wani K. Gupta, University of Maryland; Andrew A. Pouring, Sonex Research Inc.; and Eugene L. Keating, Naval Surface Warfare Cen- ter. Chemically enhanced autoignition in a spark-ignited engine with a special design of piston geometry has been observed experimen- tally, in which the engine would operate stably without a spark, once it is started by spark ignition. Under this operation mode, the engine provides lower pollutant emissions including NOx. In this process, the intermediate species left from the previous cycle play a key role in the low temperature autoignition. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of some important radical and intermediate species, such as HO2, OH, and H2O2, on autoignition by a numerical modeling approach using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism. The fuel studied is hydrogen. The effect of added HO2, OH and H2O2 on the characteristics of the autoignition of H2-air mixture is investigated. Chemically enhanced autoignition of H2-air in an inter- nal combustion engine is also simulated. It is shown that the addition of intermediate species dramatically changes the pace of autoigni- tion. 940759. Transient air flow rate estimation in a natural gas engine using a nonlinear observer. Robert W. Weeks, Modular Systems; and John J. Moskwa, University of Wisconsin. Stoichiometric air-fuel ratio control during transient operation requires an accurate estimate or measurement of the instantaneous air flow rate in an engine. Two methods are commonly used for determining engine air flow rate: air-mass sensing and conventional 4 'speed-density". The lead air flow information provided by air- mass sensors helps compensate for manifold filling and other fuel system delays. However, the high cost (and sometimes lower reli- ability) of air-mass sensors has led many manufacturers to continue to use the less accurate speed-density method for determining air flow rate. This paper develops a model-based nonlinear manifold pressure observer that estimates the flow rates at the throttle and the intake ports of an engine using speed-density type sensors. The throttle flow rate estimate can be used instead of an air-mass sensor to pro- vide the lead information necessary for accurate transient air-fuel control on TBI engines. The intake port flow rate estimate can be used on PFI engines to provide filtered approximations of port flow rates that do not contain phase lag. The estimates are achieved by embedding a simplified throttle and intake manifold model into the controller. Flow estimates are corrected in real-time by comparing a prediction of manifold pressure to measured manifold pressure. The observer's performance is simulated on a mean value, throt- tle-body-injected, natural-gas engine model. The elimination of wall wetting dynamics in this type of engine makes it an ideal candidate for the nonlinear observer presented here. Similar results could be expected with gasoline engines, although compensation for liquid fuel dynamics poses additional difficulties. Simulation results indicate that air-fuel control similar to that of a fast air-mass sensor can be achieved using the nonlinear observer. Although not presented here, versions of the observer have been successfully implemented on V8 engines with significantly different 97</page><page sequence="97">940759-940766 manifold filling characteristics. The computational complexity of the observer is simple enough to allow implementation on current eight bit engine controllers. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940760. Development of an optimized CNG passenger car with petrol limp-home system. J. van der Weide, J. M. Berendsen, and M. de Roos, TNO Road-Vehicles Research Institute ; J . F. Moreau, PSA France ; J. C. Griesemann, Renault S.A.; and G. Allard, Gaz de France. PSA, Renault, Gaz de France and TNO carried out a joint research program with the aim to develop of CNG vehicle based on a Citroën BX 19 GTI. In order to make optimal use of CNG a opti- mized engine concept (increased compression ratio) was adopted. The paper describes the engine testbed work, the vehicle body modifications and the initial vehicle testing. By increasing the com- pression ratio from 9.3: 1 to 1 1 .5: 1 the power loss of the engine when running on CNG could be limited to approximately 16%. When run- ning on petrol a similar power loss was observed. Emissions complied with the 9 1/441 /EEC regulation (CO: 18.9%; HC + NO* = 53.6%). Software developed by TNO specifi- cally for this purpose enabled TNO to make use of only one control unit (EFI-4 of Delco Electronics Inc.) to perform engine manage- ment functions for both fuels. A good driving range is obtained with a minimum loss of boot space. 940761. Study of combustion characteristics of compressed natural gas as automotive fuel. Yuji Yamamoto, Katsuhiko Sato, Seiji Matsumoto, and Shun'ichi Tsuzuki, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Some test results of CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) fueled vehi- cle have already been reported by gas companies, but they say little about the qualification of CNG for automotive fuel. This paper reports on the combustion characteristics of CNG and establishes it s qualification for alternative fuel and for clean fuel. CNG has many advantages when used in automotive engines. Since it comes as gas, it has higher octane number and allows a leaner burning than gasoline. Under designs specially created to take advantage of CNG, an unique engine system was achieved which would not have been realized with gasoline fuel. GNG has some demerits, however, such as decrease in power, poor component durability, and short driving range by one tankful. Thus its study should be continued to establish CNG as automotive fuel. 940762. The feasibility of using a near-infrared spectrometer to estimate selected properties of natural gas. Steven R. West- brook, Southwest Research Institute. It has been demonstrated that the composition of compressed nat- ural gas can have a marked effect on the operational characteristics of engines that burn natural gas as a fuel. For this reason, a quick and accurate method of determining natural gas composition is needed. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has the potential of meet- ing the requirements for a natural gas analyzer. The limited scope study was conducted as a preliminary demon- stration of the feasibility of using NIR as an on-line natural gas ana- lyzer at a distribution site or perhaps as an on- board vehicle fuel sensor in a natural gas vehicle (NGV). Reference gases were ana- lyzed and used to develop calibration models for three selected properties of natural gas. These properties were heat of combustion (higher heating value), Wobbe Index (heat of combustion per unit volume divided by the specific gravity of the gas), and hydrogen/ carbon ratio. Transmission spectra were collected over the region of 900 to 1800 nanometers. All spectra were measured at a gas pressure of 206.8 kPa (30psig) and a temperature of 22.8 to 23.4°C in the gas cell. Spectra were collected with both flowing gas and static gas in the gas cell. Multivariate calibration techniques were used to develop calibration models for each of the properties investigated. This study shows that NIR, using a fiber-optic probe, has the potential to measure accurately several properties of natural gas. Calibration model validations were also conducted with mixed results. Further work is required to expand the calibration models. 940763. CNG utilization in small engines. Kaoru Hara and Hiroaki Yonetani, Tokyo Polytechnic College ; and Naoki Okanishi and Itaru Fukutani, University of Industrial Technology. Using a 4-cycle engine fueled by either CNG or gasoline, the engine performance was investigated by varying the excess air fac- tor, ignition timing and compression ratio. Also, the effects of adding oxygen gas during CNG operation were investigated. As a result, it was found that CNG operation was effective not only in improving the brake thermal efficiency but also in reducing exhaust gas emissions. 940764. The development of improved fuel specifications for methanol (M85) and Ethanol (Ed85). Norman D. Brinkman, Rob- ert Halsall, Scott W. Jorgensen, and John E. Kirwan, General Motors NAO R&amp;D Center. Fuel alcohols, such as M85 (a blend of 85 percent by volume methanol with hydrocarbons) and Ed85 (a blend of 85 percent by volume denatured ethanol with hydrocarbons), are inherently involatile at low temperatures and may contain soluble or insoluble contaminants. We explored the adequacy of existing specifications for M85 and E&lt;j85 by studying fuel effects on cold starting and vapor flammability, and fuel contaminant effects on materials compatibil- ity and filter plugging. These studies demonstrated deficiencies in existing specifications. Therefore, we developed General Motors specifications for M85 and Ed85 to improve vehicle performance and durability. Key features include a Cold Starting Performance Index to improve wintertime starting, a conductivity and chloride ion specification to reduce corrosion, and a particulate contamina- tion limit to reduce filter plugging. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940765. IN-use volatility impact of commingling ethanol and non- ethanol fuels. Peter J. Caffrey and Paul A. Machiele, United States Environmental Protection Agency. An analysis of the potential Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) impacts of the commingling of ethanol fuels with non-ethanol fuels has been done. This analysis includes a computer model that tracks such vari- ables as owner brand loyalty, fill-up patterns, ethanol fuel market share and percent ethanol in the fuel tank to determine the RVP boost that is associated with the use of ethanol as a gasoline oxygen- ate as it intermingles with non- ethanol fuels in vehicle fuel tanks. Results indicate that the use of ethanol oxygenated fuels can cause, in some cases, a significant increase in gasoline RVP, thus leading to higher evaporative emissions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940766. Hydrogen as an alternative automotive fuel: 1993 update. Carl A. Kukkonen, Consultant; and Mordecai Shelef Ford Motor Co. In 1981, one of us authored an SAE Paper - ''Hydrogen as an Alternative Automotive Fuel" and concluded that although the hydrogen fuel/vehicle system was technically feasible, it was not competitive with other alternative fuel/vehicle systems and pre- dicted that hydrogen would not be used as an automotive fuel in this century. The current paper revisits the subject 12 years later. In 1981, energy concerns were dominant, and coal-based synthetic fuels were viewed as viable alternatives to petroleum and natural gas, which were predicted to become scarce and very expensive. Today, environmental issues are crucial and global warming con- cerns will probably limit the future use of coal, and petroleum and natural gas are cheaper than they were in 1981. The paper examines advances in hydrogen production, distribution, on-board storage and use as an automotive fuel in internal combustion engines (ICE) and fuel cell electric vehicles. It also considers tailpipe and overall CO2 emissions. Hydrogen ICE vehicles are less attractive than competing 98</page><page sequence="98">940766-940779 battery electric vehicles and natural gas ICE vehicles. Fuel cell vehi- cles are theoretically more attractive, but face technical challenges which will bar them as a prospect for automotive applications before 2010 at the earliest. Setting up a large-scale hydrogen fuel infra- structure will be extremely expensive and will take decades. There- fore, it is concluded that hydrogen will not be used as an automotive fuel before the year 2020. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940767. Study of partial oxidation combustor using ultra- sonic atomizer to improve cold startability of methanol engine. Junichi Nishimura, Daijiro Hosogai, and Tadashi ho , Tonen Corp.; and Nobuo Iwai, and Motoaki Akai , Japan Automobile Research Institute , Inc. This study describes the ignition of methanol spray formed by an ultrasonic atomizer under sub-zero conditions and the design of the methanol combustor as a H2+CO generator, based on partial oxi- dation reaction, for cold starting methanol engines. The methanol spray formed by the ultrasonic atomizer was observed to be ignited using a conventional ignition system even at sub-zero temperatures. Analysis of the spray characteristics showed that this successful ignition was attributed to the high amount of methanol vapor generated, which results from the fine spray and low momentum. The combustor using the ultrasonic atomizer was designed and tested. The combustor produced gaseous starting fuel (H2+CO) sat- isfactorily by using an adequate air register. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940768. Coolant pump failure rates as a function of coolant type and formulation. Shannon S. Scott, John E. Orth, and David L. Miller, Texaco, Inc. Automobile coolant pump failure rates have been observed to be influenced by the coolant inhibitor package. A fleet test consisting of 196, 1991 Ford Crown Victoria taxi cabs was utilized to test six coolant formulations. Four of the test formulations were monobasic/ dibasic organic acid technology coolants and two were traditional technology coolants containing nitrate, phosphate, and silicate. Coolant pump failure rates were monitored as a function of mileage. Results indicate that the service life of coolant pumps for those sys- tems employing organic acid technology coolants was significantly greater than those systems utilizing traditional inhibitor technology coolants. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940769. A compatibility study of mixtures of a monoacid/ dibasic acid coolant and a traditional nitrite-free coolant. Paul Van de Ven and Jean-Pierre Maes, Texaco Research &amp; Develop- ment. Mixtures of a novel corrosion inhibitor, based on the synergistic combination of aliphatic mono- and dibasic acids with a tradition coolant have been evaluated in: a stability test, an electrochemical test, the ASTM D 1384 Glassware Corrosion Test, the ASTM D 4340 Aluminum Heat-Rejection Test and a Dynamic Heat- Transfer Test. This paper discusses the results of these tests and the relevance of the tests in assessing the performance of the coolant mixtures. Recommendations are made to the selection of methods that provide significant information on coolant compatibility. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940771. Determination of the effects of inlet air velocity and temperature distributions on the performance of an automotive radiator. Kader A. Fellague, S. ' Huey" Hu, and Donald A. Wil- loughby, Ford Motor Co. In an automotive engine cooling system, the heat rejected to the coolant by the engine and other components is transferred to the air by the radiator. The cooling system engineer must predict the cool- ant inlet temperature (the top water temperature) for each operating conditions of interest. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computer programs have been developed to predict the cooling air flow velocities and temper- atures entering the radiator. Radiator effectiveness is measured on a calorimeter with uniform air velocity and temperature entering the radiator. Computer programs have been developed to predict calorimeter performance for new radiators based on experimental data from existing components. In applying the calorimeter performance model to a vehicle, some means must be used to derate the performance slightly based on the non-uniform inlet air velocity and temperature distribution entering the radiator. In this paper we have developed a method for calculating a non- uniformity factor from the radiator effectiveness tables and from the velocity and temperature distributions provide by the CFD codes. Instead of applying the NTU method for the whole heat exchanger, the radiator is subdivided into small cells which are effectively micro heat exchangers and the NTU/Effectiveness method is applied to each individual cell. 940776.

The persistent occurrence of microporosity defects in AZ91 cast- ings has made it difficult to consistently produce sound parts. Earlier work established that dissolved hydrogen gas causes microporosity defects in AZ91; however, the exact role of hydrogen in the nucle- ation and growth of microporosity was not determined. In this paper, the behavior of dissolved hydrogen gas in elemental magnesium, AZ91 alloy, and liquid binary Mg/Al alloys were studied. The results show that during the last stages of solidification, hydrogen gas is rejected from the MgnAl^ intermetallic compound to assist in the nucleation and/or growth of microporosity. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940777. (SP- 1022) The effects of varying aluminum and rare- earth content on the mechanical properties of die cast magne- sium alloys. Terje Kr. Aune and Hàkon Westengen, Hydro Research Center ; and Thomas Ruden, Hydro Magnesium Marketing. The development of commercial magnesium die casting alloys has progressed over the past several decades. The most commonly used die casting alloy, AZ91D, with 9% aluminum content, has been and still is used in the majority of structural automotive applications. New magnesium alloys have been developed in the past several years to meet the needs of structural applications that require an appreciable amount of creep resistance and improved stress ralaxa- tion performance during service. Typical applications would include powertrain components. This paper provides further mechanical property data on the "AE-Type" magnesium alloys. These alloys consist primarily of aluminum and rear-earth additions to magnesium to increase creep resistance and stress ralaxation performance attributes of the base metal. However, changes in tensile strength, elongation, etc. may also be realized. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940779. (SP- 1022) Physical metallurgy of magnesium die cast alloys. Daniel J. Sakkinen, Dow Chemical Co. Magnesium alloys offer the designer many unique properties not found in other alloy systems. Magnesium's low density and good strength have contributed to its successful use in a number of auto- motive applications. However, even with this successful track record, magnesium may still not be considered for future applica- tions due to a lack of complete information about the metal and its alloys. This paper is intended to provide the automotive designer with single source for properties by exploring the relationship between alloying elements and the physical and mechanical proper- ties of die cast magnesium alloys. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 99</page><page sequence="99">940780-940786 940780. Technician Payoffs: Getting results through perfor- mance audits. Gary • J. Corrigan, DAna Corp.; and Victor Tsim- pinos, BP Oil. The challenge for the future of automotive repair lies in the industry's ability to improve its productivity. The auto repair indus- try has not made the quality improvements that the automotive man- ufacturing industry has made in the past years. The first step to improve productivity is to identify the areas that have the most impact on productivity. This is the value of a performance audit. A performance audit identifies the processes that improve pro- ductivity. You cannot perform better than the process allows. If the process has problems, it will impair performance despite training efforts or motivation to improve. In the automotive repair business there are seven key areas that will benefit from a performance audit. They are: technical compe- tence/training, administrative, sales and marketing, customer satis- faction, housekeeping, financial, and environmental and safety. To be more productive requires a knowledge of those items and a fol- low-up plan for improvement. The results of one company's performance audit documented the kinds of improvement that can follow a good audit. Such an audit had specific objectives, measurements, and an action plan. The audit information gave the company an understanding of customers' expectations of service and guided them in setting successful perfor- mance standards that produced profitable results. It also identified the strengths and areas of development for the technicians so that they could better serve their customers. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940781.

Reddy, S. T. Gulati, D. W. Lambert, P. S. Schmitt, and D. S. Weiss, Corning, Inc. The design, performance and optimization of the extruded elec- trically heated metal converter have recently been published. The present paper focuses on the physical durability of extruded metal EHC support at high temperature representative of operating condi- tions. The mechanical, thermal, creep and fatigue properties of Fe- Cr-Al honeycomb structure over 25°-1000°C temperature range are reported. In addition, the stresses arising from mounting and thermal loads are computed via finite element analysis and compared with the high temperature strength of extruded metal EHC support. A safe design stress which predicts 192,000 kilometer durability is estimated from high temperature fatigue behavior of extruded Fe- Cr-Al honeycomb structure. 940783. (SP- 1044) Fuel effects on emissions from an advanced technology vehicle, part II. Joseph E. Kubsh, W.R. Grace á Co.; and Phillip A. Weber, Southwest Research Institute. A 1991 Toyota Camry equipped with an electrically-heated cata- lyst/light-off converter system was evaluated for emissions in dupli- cate over the light-duty Federal Test Procedure (FTP) with three dif- ferent fuels. Evaluations were conducted with the electrically heated catalyst (EHC) in place, both without any external heating and with the EHC operated using a post-crank heating strategy. The EHC sys- tem was placed immediately upstream of an original production cat- alyst which was located 40.6 cm from the exhaust manifold. The three test fuels were: 1) a fuel meeting California's Phase II gasoline specifications; 2) a low- sulfur (48 ppm) version of the Auto/Oil industry average gasoline; and 3) the Auto/Oil industry average gas- oline, RF-A. On average, NMOG emissions and the ozone forming potential of the exhaust hydrocarbons exhibited the following trend for tests run in unheated and EHC-active modes: Phase II &lt; low- sulfur RF-A &lt; /RF-A. EHC operation on this test vehicle resulted in approximately a 50-percent reduction in average NMOG emis- sions, relative to unheated operation, independent of fuel composi- tion. NMOG mass emission rates when operating on either version of the industry average gasoline were near the 50,000-mile LEV standard, but exhibited a strong dependence on the temperature achieved by the EHC during the post-heat period. Mass emission rates of toxics including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, and benzene are summarized both with and without the EHC active. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940784. (SP- 1044) Study of ceramic catalyst optimization for emission purification efficiency. Minoru Machida and Toshio Y amada, NGK Insulators, Ltd.; and Mikio Makino, NGK-Locke, Inc. In this study, to satisfy increasingly strict emission regulations, the conversion efficiency of a 0.1 1 mm (4 mil) thin- wall catalyst is discussed. The effects of catalyst bulk density on reducing heat mass to improve catalyst emission conversion in the early cold tran- sient mode (Bag 1 in the FTP-75 mode) is quantitatively discussed. To analyze the effects of low heat mass, catalyst's bed temperatures were measured. Effects of the geometric surface area (GSA) and volume of the catalyst were also analyzed. An early feedback control system with an HEGO oxygen sensor and a secondary air injection control system with an original oxygen sensor were compared with an original control system on THC, CO, and NOx emission amounts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940785. Development of medium carbon microalloyed steel forgings for automotive components. Won-Suk Cho, Kun-Sang Kim, Eung-Keun Jo, and Seung-Taik Oh, Kia Motors Corp. Full scale developments of microalloyed steel forgings (0.4C-V modified) for connecting rods and wheel hubs are discussed in this presentation. Mechanical properties were evaluated in terms of vari- ous processing parameters and the resulting microstructures. Tensile strength obtained in MA steel by air cooling was equal to or grater than that produced in the quenched and tempered steel. Generally, increasing austenitizing temperature (900 C - 1300 C) and cooling rate (box cooling &lt; air cooling &lt; fan cooling ) resulted in increased tensile strength. Impact toughness did not show the significant dependence of cooling rate, while decreasing austenitizing tempera- ture enhanced impact toughness. The impact toughness of the mic- roalloyed steel forgings obtained from optimum process showed poorer performance than that of quenched and tempered steel forg- ings but satisfied the specification made from the design view point. One of the most important efforts for microstructural investigations is to characterize manganese sulfides. The Manganese Sulphides were revealed to act as ferrite nucleation sites and thus to improve fracture toughness. This paper also aims to evaluate and analyze the machinability of microalloyed steel in terms of cutting force, surface roughness and chip treatment, compared with the conventional quenched and tempered steel. It was found that machining perfor- mance of the microalloyed steel was dependent on cutting condi- tions, such as, speed, feed, and depth of cut. 940786. Strengthening of surface induction hardened parts for automotive shafts subject to torsional load. Tatsuro Och i and Yoshiro Koyasu, Nippon Steel Corp. The purpose of this study is twofold: to clarify the factors gov- erning the torsional strength of surface induction hardened parts and, to present a method for strengthening automotive shaft parts for their weight reduction. The torsional strength against Mode III frac- 100</page><page sequence="100">940786-940795 ture can be expressed by a new indicator, "equivalent hardness" defined as an average hardness weighted with the radius squared. If the equivalent hardness is continuously increased, the fracture mode changes from Mode III to Mode I. The torsional strength against Mode I fracture is governed by grain boundary strength. Accordingly, the key-points in increasing the torsional strength of surface induction hardened parts are to raise the equivalent hardness and increase the grain boundary strength of the steel. By application of this method, the torsional strength of steel can be raised by 50%, which, in turn, enables about a 25% weight reduction for shaft parts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940787. The effect of forging conditions on the flow behavior and microstructure of a medium carbon microalloyed forging steel. Nicholas E. Aloi, Jr., George Krauss, and Chester J. Van Tyne, Colorado School of Mines; and Yi-Wen Cheng, National Insti- tute of Standards and Technology. Forging simulations with a 1522 steel microalloyed by additions of 0.25% Mo, 0.13% V and 0.01% Ti were preformed on a labora- tory thermomechanical processing simulator. The forging condi- tions included a strain rate of 22s"1, 50% strain, and temperatures in the range of 1200°C to 950°C. The true stress was found to increase with decreasing deformation temperature for all values of instantaneous true strain. The maximum flow stress increased two- fold as deformation temperature decreased from 1200°C to 950°C, and the recrystallized austenite grain size decreased by a factor of two for this same decrease in temperature. Microstructures evolve from bainitic/ferritic at a cooling rate of 1.4°C/s, to fully martensitic at 16.8°C/s, independent of deformation temperature. Room temper- ature hardness depended primarily on cooling rate and were essen- tially independent of deformation temperature. Hardness ranged from 27 HRC to 48 HRC for the bainitic/ferritic and martensitic microstructures, respectively. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940788. The effect of reheat treatments on fatigue and frac- ture of carburized steels. R. Scott Hyde, George Krauss, and David K. Matlock, Colorado School of Mines. The effects of austenite grain size on the bending fatigue crack initiation and fatigue performance of gas carburized, modified 4320 steels were studied. The steels were identical in composition except for phosphorus concentration which ranged between 0.005 and 0.031 wt%. Following the carburizing cycle, specimens were sub- jected to single and triple reheat treatments of 820°C for 30 minutes to refine the austenite grain structure, and oil quenched and tem- pered at 1 50°C. Specimens subjected to bending fatigue were char- acterized by light metallography to determine microstructure and grain size, X-ray analysis for retained austenite and residual stress measurements, and scanning electron microscopy for examination of fatigue crack initiation and propagation. The surface austenite grain size ranged from 15 pm in the as-carburized condition to 6 and 4 pm diameter grain size for the single and triple reheat conditions, respectively. The reheated core grain structures were coarser than the reheated case grain diameters. Endurance limits for the reheat specimens were determined to be 1400 MPa for the triple reheat specimens, independent of phosphorus concentration, and 1350 and 1275 MPa for the single reheat specimens containing 0.005-0.017 and 0.031 wt% phosphorus, respectively. Grain size refinement caused a shift in bending fatigue crack initiation from intergranular cracking associated with phosphorus segregation and carbide forma- tion to intergranular cracking limited to the intergranular oxidation zone fo gas-carburized specimens. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940790. Development of a bench test to detect oils corrosive to engine components. Jerry C. Wang and Carmen M. Cusano, Cummins Engine Co. Corrosive wear of non-ferrous engine components by lubricants is a concern of all major heavy duty diesel engine manufacturers since warranty on key engine components has been extended to 500, 000 miles. Several commercial lubricants have been linked to pre- mature cam and rod bearing followers induced by corrosion in cer- tain fleets. Although the overall failure rate is low, specific fleets have experienced significantly higher failure rates due to the lubri- cants used. These failures usually occur at high mileage but less than 500,000 miles. This kind of slow corrosion easily escapes detection of engine tests contained in current oil specifications, and it repre- sents a serious issue in long term warranty cost to diesel engine man- ufacturers. A comprehensive fleet database has been established to identify the most corrosive lubricants. These lubricants have served as reference oils to develop a corrosion bench test. Adopting such a test will have a great impact on long term durability of heavy duty diesel engines. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940792. Oil aeration in high speed combustion engines. A. Haas, F. MaaBen, and U. Geiger, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH á Co. Modern passenger car engines are designed to operate at increas- ingly higher rated engine speeds with more internal parts (multi- valve engines) requiring lubrication. There is a higher probability for the oil quality to deteriorate due to an unfavorably high level of oil aeration. The high oil aeration can cause hydraulic lash adjuster misfunction and connecting rod bearing failure. This paper presents results of recent research and development work concerning the occurrence of oil aeration within the lubricant system of modern combustion engines. In particular, the work has concentrated on the following: How oil aeration affects engine oper- ation; How cavitation occurs in the supply bore to the connecting rod bearings; and What causes air entrainment in lubricants. 940793. Proper antioxidant selection for API SH by statisti- cal evaluation in a new sequence IIIE screening test. G. A. Maz- zamaro, M. Hutchings, M. W. Var go, S. Evans, and D. Cass idy, Ciba Additives. A bench test has been developed to simulate sequence IIIE engine test viscosity increase. This test was used to evaluate two dif- ferent alkylated diphenylamine antioxidants in a "marginally for- mulated" SG oil. Variations in lubricant performance were statisti- cally analyzed. The predicted time required to reach 375% viscosity increase in the sequence IIIE (T375) was found to differ by up to 5 hours for these lubricants containing different alkylated diphenyl- amine antioxidants. The application of Multiple Test Acceptance criteria (MTAC) for API SH oils will bring with it the need for a higher level of lubricant oxidative stability. This new bench test can be a useful tool in the selection of high performance antioxidants. 940794. Development of a valve train wear test procedure for gasoline engine oil. Kenji Hanada, Yasuhiro Murakami, Yusuke Shoji, and Hisamoto Aihara, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. An analysis was made of wear factors by investigating the effect of engine operating conditions on valve train wear. It was found that cam nose wear increased as larger amounts of combustion products, including nitrogen oxides and unburned gasoline, became inter- mixed with the engine oil. Based on these results, a valve train wear test procedure has been developed for evaluating cam nose and rocker arm wear under engine firing conditions. It has been confirmed that this test procedure correlates well with ASTM Sequence VE test and CCMC TU-3 test. 940795. (SP- 101 2) Advanced entertainment and communica- tion networking based on fiber optics for vehicle applications. Herbert Hetzel, Harald Schopp, and Patrick Heck, Becker Automo- tive Systems. The rising complexity of entertainment- and communication components in automobiles requires system solutions which are likely to consist of several separated devices, even in the future. Increasing demands with regard to system diagnostics and electro- magnetic interference on the one hand and the necessity to lower 101</page><page sequence="101">940795-940808 system costs on the other, force automotive industries to develop concepts avoiding any redundancies and to optimize data links for component interconnections. As the car is a particularly harsh envi- ronment for distributed audio/video communication systems (lim- ited space, high levels of electromagnetic radiation that interferes with analog signals) fiber optical network solutions can be a suitable way to solve the problem. The paper consists of a situation analysis in the mobile communication network field, presents a network set up on the AES/EBU audio standard and D2B OPTICAL protocol to transmit source and control data simultaneously on the same fiber and concludes with strategies for future applications. 940796. (SP- 101 2) Development of an optical link for auto- mobiles. Shigeto Kawamura, Kouji Kishimoto, and Hayato Yuuki, Sumitomo Wiring Systems, Ltd. We have developed an optical link which is suitable for the on- vehicle environment and can be used in navigation systems and other applications. The distinctive features of this link are its fiber structure, terminal processing, shielding and protective mechanism for fiber ends. In terms of the fiber structure, a high tension of 100N has been realized without using tension member in the fiber, and a heat resistance temperature of 105 deg C has also been achieved. Terminal processing is done with only crimping and heat treatment, and shielding of the receiver IC is achieved with a molded compo- nent composed of electrically conductive plastic. To keep the ends of fibers from being damaged or soiled, the link is equipped with a mechanism wherein a protective hood rotates at engagement and disengagement. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940798.

This paper introduces for the first time a fully connectorized pas- sive optical star for use with plastic optical fiber that addresses all automotive application requirements. A unique mixing element is presented that offers linear expendability, uniformity of insertion loss, and packaging flexibility. The star is constructed of all plastic molded components to make it low cost and producible in high vol- ume and is single-ended to facilitate vehicle integration.

(SP- 101 2) New types of connectors for plastic optical fibers for vehicle network applications. Gerd Schreiter, Andreas Engel, and Georghe Hotea, AMP Deutschland GmbH. Two different types of connectors for plastic optical fibers have been developed that meet the hard environmental requirements of vehicle network applications. Both connectors, a lens connector and a planar endface connector type, are based on the same principle design. Although this design enables an easy and cheap termination process by cutting the fiber endfaces only, excellent low insertion losses of the connectors between (1.3 and 1.5)dB have been achieved. Furthermore the connectors can be applied in high tem- perature range between (-40 and 80)°C. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940800.

Passive star networks have been shown to be the best architecture for high speed vehicle networks. This paper attempts to describe how problems in passive star networks can be diagnosed in the field. The potential physical layer failure modes for passive star networks are detailed, and a network test tool is described which is capable of determining whether a media fault exists and locating the position of that fault. The application of the test tool to potential failure modes is discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940801. (SP- 101 2) New design of N*N coupler and connectors for plastic optical fibers. Egbert T. C. M. van Woesik, Jan Post, and Harry H. Kokken, AMP European Development Center. This paper presents a N*N bi-directional star coupler and two types of connectors for plastic fiber. The N*N coupler is based on the mixing rod technique. Nor- mally, when using a mixing rod the uniformity of the output ports is poor. The star coupler presented here combines low loss, good uniformity, low cost and ease of production. Intensive research has been carried out on light distribution in the mixing rod and the con- nection of the fibers to it. The two connector types can be easily terminated to plastic fibers: fiber ends are inserted into the connectors and the installer, often a mechanic, does not need to make and end-finish (polish or hot-plate) at the mating face of the connector. 940802. (SP- 1041) Survey of airbag involved accidents - An analysis of collision characteristics, system effectiveness and injuries. John V. Werner and Wayne W. Sorenson, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. In May, 1989, State Farm began to collect field data on crashes involving airbag deployments. The data included crash configura- tions and locations, driver actions, deployment thresholds and rates, repair cost contributions, and injury profiles. The effectiveness of airbags in reducing injuries is described, including efforts by one manufacturer to reduce abrasion and contu- sion injuries, which are among the most common minor injuries in airbag deployments. Analysis shows that airbag systems are work- ing as intended; that is, in frontal crashes where moderate to severe injuries to the face and torso would otherwise be likely. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940803.

In this paper, testing techniques for electronic single point frontal crash sensing systems are presented. Particular attention is paid to the algorithms used by these modules. First, a description of a new performance measure called the Crash Detector Operating Charac- teristic (CDOC) is given. Using the Monte Carlo crash testing tech- nique, a quantitative definition of this measure is described. Two new ways of testing single point modules or algorithms are pres- ented. All of these techniques and approaches lead to objective per- formance measures. Conclusions and recommendations are drawn from the discussion of the new measures. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940804. (SP- 1041) Development of a new downsized airbag system for use in passenger vehicles. James P. Karlow, J. John Jakovski, and Brian Seymour, Takata, Inc. An issue placing significant pressure on airbag systems develop- ment at the current time is the need to downsize the entire airbag module in order to reduce weight and cost, offer better styling options for automotive original-equipment manufacturer (OEM) design engineers, and improve occupant safety. However, because components of the module are interrelated - both functionally and physically - size and weight reductions necessitate a total systems approach to engineering. This paper will discuss an integrated approach to airbag systems design and will describe new airbag systems that offer significant weight and size reductions over current configurations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940808. (SP- 1010) The wettability of silicon carbide by liquid pure aluminum and aluminum alloys. Do-Suck Han and Jong-Ku Yoon, Hyundai Motor Co. There have been strong moves in recent years to introduce the metal matrix composites concept into higher volume applications, notably the automotive field where large volume production and lower material costs are required. The wettability between reinforc- 102</page><page sequence="102">940808-940813 ing materials and base material is one of important factors for the strength of composites and its manufacture. The main objective of this paper is to establish a basic understanding of wetting phenom- ena in SiC/liquid aluminum and aluminum alloy systems. In the present paper, results from the sessile drop method are reported for the effects on the wetting angle, 0, of free silicon in the silicon car- bide substrate and of alloying additions of silicon, copper or magne- sium to the aluminum drop for the temperature range 700-900 or 1400°C in the titanium-gettered vacuum (1.3 x 10~2 / 1.3 x 10~3 Pa). Wetting angle, 0, was reduce by a factor as large as 2.8 for pure aluminum on reaction bonded, compared with sintered silicon car- bide, attributable to partial dissolution by the aluminum of the 18 wt% free silicon present in the reaction- bonded material. For wet- ting of reaction-bonded silicon carbide, the addition of 5 wt% sili- con, copper or magnesium to the aluminum gave contact angle that decreased in the sequence Si - &gt; Cu - &gt; Mg, with the magnesium addition being the only one result in wetting (i.e. 0 &lt; 90°) for all conditions studied. These results may have implications for design of conditions for joining or promotion of infiltration of silicon car- bide parts, preforms or arrays with aluminum alloy melts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940809. (SP- 1010) Characterization of high temperature properties in Al matrix composite fabricated by the low pres- sure squeeze infiltration process. Byung J. Lee, Yong S. Park, Kun U. Park, and Taewon Lim, Hyundai Motor Co. Al matrix composites containing alumina (AFO3) fibers are fab- ricated by the low pressure (25MPa) squeeze infiltration process which is suitable for the low cost mass production. Mechanical properties at room temperature as well as elevated temperatures (250°C, 350°C) are improved due to the presence of reinforcements. Up to 350°C, composites maintain a reasonable strength, which is much better than strength of the conventional Al alloy. Composites have equivalent wear rates to those of Ni - resist cast iron. Wear behavior is changed with the sliding speed. At low sliding speed, wear proceeds by the excessive failure of matrix and fiber, whilst, at higher sliding speed, matrix fracture near Fiber plays a major role in wear. Wear resistance of 125°C is inferior to that of room temper- ature due to the reduction of mechanical properties followed by matrix softening and poor bonding. Al matrix composite possesses enough mechanical and tribological properties to be applied as a material for engine components. 940810. (SP- 1010) The effect of thermal cycling on the mechanical properties of the macro-interface in squeeze cast composites, onnor, Michael J. O and F. E. Wawner, University of Virginia. Selectively reinforced squeeze cast automotive pistons contain a boundary between the reinforced and unreinforced regions. This boundary is known as the macro-interface. Due to the difference in CTE between the composite and unreinforced matrix, the macro- interface can be the site of residual stress formation during cooling from the casting or heat treatment temperature. Subsequent thermal exposure, particularly thermal cycling, may produce cyclic stress at this interface causing it to experience fatigue. It has been found that matrix precipitates at the macro-interface and the aging behavior of the matrix also may play a role in defining the strength of the macro- interface during thermal cycling conditions. 940811. (SP- 1010) Fatigue properties of an A356 (AlSi7Mg) aluminum alloy for automotive applications - Fatigue life pre- diction. Jack A. 0degard, SINTEF Production Engineering ; and Ketill Pedersen, SINTEF Metallurgy. The fatigue properties of an A356 (AlSi7Mg) alloy have been investigated. Both materials free from and containing casting defects have been compared. In the defect free material persistent slip bands (PSBs) are formed in the inter-dendritic triple points. By extrusion, however, the inter-dendritic distribution of primary silicon particles is replaced by an almost uniform distribution of smaller Si particles. Persistent slip bands are formed near the primary Si particles and an increase in the density of PSBs are observed resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of the strain. A significant increase in fatigue life is measured. Material containing pores shows approximately 509c reduction in fatigue life compared to the defect free material, and the fatigue strength at 107 cycles is reduced by 20 9c. Cracks are initiated from the casting defects and most of the fatigue life is spent in the fatigue crack growth regime. A model has been used to predict the fatigue life. When assuming simultaneous crack initiation from three pores located 0.7 mm apart from each other on the same plane and that these cracks are growing together and forming the final crack, a good correlation is found between the predicted and the measured fatigue life. 940812. (SP- 1010) Thixoforming of aluminum-based metal matrix composite systems. P. R. G. Anderson, Lucas Advanced Engineering Centre ; and A. R. A. McLelland and P. J. Ward, Uni- versity of Sheffield. Possible materials' solutions to mass reduction in the transport industry are to be found within particulate-reinforced aluminum alloy matrix composites. The objective of this paper is to demon- strate how thixoforming may solve material and manufacturing problems for metallic composites with silicon carbide or silicon par- ticles. Silicon carbide reinforced alloy was thixoformed successfully, at several reinforcement levels, showing a well-maintained particle distribution. Hypereutectic aluminum - silicon material was pro- duced with fine uniform microstructure giving a high Young's mod- ulus and low coefficient of thermal expansion. The results provide alternative approaches for solving slightly differing design problems and applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940813. A rotary valve combustion system with throttleless inlet charge control. Paul C. Cross and Craig N. Hansen, Hansen Engine Corp.; and Jay K. Martin, University of Wisconsin. A Rotary Valve combustion System (RVS) is being developed which is a potential alternative to the conventional poppet valve combustion chamber systems currently in use on four-stoke recipro- cating automotive engines. The RVS has been developed to operate in a Variable Valve Timing (VVT) mode, termed RVS/VVT. The system accomplishes variation of intake-valve-closure from 50 degrees After-Top-Center (ATC) to 250 degrees ATC. This broad range of variability is necessary to achieve throttleless power control from idle to full power. The RVS was evaluated for characteristics which were indepen- dent of its valve timing mode. These included: (1) system friction, (2) seal effectiveness, and (3) combustion performance at full load. System friction for the RVS valve train was measured by a pulley transducer on the drive-belt. Seal effectiveness was evaluated by static differential compression tests and dynamic blowby measure- ments. Combustion performance was similar to that of conventional systems, as indicated by the heat release histories which were simi- lar for ignition and main combustion. The RVS/VVT system was tested for characteristics which were altered by implementation of the VVT mode. These included: (1) throttling-loss reduction at part-load, (2) combustion performance, (3) volumetric efficiency, and (4) idle stability. Results indicated that while producing the same Net Indicated Mean Effective Pres- sure (NIMEP), the "positive-loop" portion of the IMEP was reduced up to 12% due to the lower pumping MEP at part-loads. It is anticipated that this will translate into corresponding reductions in fuel consumption, assuming comparable valve train frictional losses. The combustion analysis for the VVT system exhibited faster burn rates than the conventionally throttle case, and registered low coefficient of variation in cycle-to-cycle indicated power. Volumet- ric efficiency was improved across the engine's speed range by vir- 103</page><page sequence="103">940813-940822 tue of the VVT's ability to tailor the timing of intake-valve-closing to the optimum point for each respective engine speed. As a result, the maximum IMEP attainable at low engine speed was significantly improved. The use of a simple tuned-pipe intake produced typical manifold dynamic tuning effects which, although not specifically optimized, combined with the airflow capacity and variable valve timings capability to produce volumetric efficiencies ranging from 85% at 2000 rpm to a peak value of 95% at 4500 rpm. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940815.

Winterbone, UMIST. A gasoline engine with the expansion ratio of 14: 1 for better effi- ciency is presented. The engine has intake control rotary valves to reduce the effective compression ratio for knock avoidance and to control power output. Compute simulation, based on the method of characteristics and quasi-steady model, indicated the advantage of the rotary valve system as well as the optimum design of the valve actuation. Experimental results showed a good agreement with the prediction, and BSFC of under 240 g/kWh was achieved at load higher than 50%. However, at very light load, the conventional throttle valve operation was inevitable, which somewhat worsened the advantage of the new system. The mileage for a car driving cycle and constant speeds were also estimated and it was forecast that optimized supercharging would significantly benefit the fuel econ- omy. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940816. Control of engine load via electromagnetic valve actuators. Mark A. Theobald, Bruno Lequesne, and Rassem Henry, General Motors Corp. The purpose of this research was to demonstrate new electromag- netic valve actuators on a running engine and to explore the effi- ciency and emissions advantages of variable valve actuation. A sin- gle-cylinder research engine was equipped with programmable elec- tromagnetic valve actuators and operated with early intake-valve closing in addition to conventional throttling, both methods with and without exhaust gas recirculation. The engine was run at a fixed speed of 1500 r/min over varying load at stoichiometric air-fuel mixture, with and without swirl generated by a shrouded intake valve. Engine performance and emissions were measured with spark timing adjusted to minimum advance for best torque. Early intake- valve closing showed a net-efficiency gain over conventional throt- tling without EGR, but essentially no gain over conventional throt- tling with heavy EGR dilution in the test engine. Electrical input energy for the actuators was less than the equivalent friction loss for a conventional non-roller valvetrain at this speed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940818. Modeling of corrosion of cylinder liner in diesel engines caused by sulphur in the diesel fuel. Jesper Schramm, Technical University of Denmark; Svend Henningsen, B &amp; W Die- sel ; and Spencer C. Sorenson, Technical University of Denmark. Due to increasing problems with corrosive wear in marine diesel engines, caused by sulfuric acid, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of corrosion. Based on experience with large marine diesel engine operation, a mechanism model is proposed and veri- fied by comparison with practical experience. From operation of engines it is known that the corrosion problem is most severe where the lubrication of the liner is most unsatisfactory. Therefore, most effort is put into modeling the formation and transportation of acid in the lubricant film area. Results from modeling the risk of corro- sion during different engine operation conditions are presented. 940819. Prediction of viscosity-shear properties for VI improved crankcase oils. E. E. Klaus and J. L. Duda, Pennsylvania State Univ.; and V. Bala, Ethyl Petroleum Additives, Inc. This study evaluates the shear-thinning effect of a commercial Viscosity Index (VI) improver in a variety of mineral oil base stocks to produce a series of viscosity grades from 0W-20 to 20W- 50. All of these fluids also include a DI package in addition to an olefin copolymer VI improver and base oil. The Penn State high shear cap- illary viscometer was used to collect the primary data at shear rates of up to 106s"1 and at 10 to 177°C. Data are fitted to a double trun- cated power law model to determine the incipient non-Newtonian shear rate yi, the power law index n, and the incipient second New- tonian shear rate fi. These parameters are found to be smooth func- tions of temperature and polymer concentration the different base stocks. Using the data obtained for 0W-20, 10W-30 and 20W-50 SAE grade formulations, these parameters (yi, y: and n) are corre- lated as functions of temperature, polymer concentration, and a vis- cosity temperature property of the base oil. These correlations were then used to predict yi, fi and n for 10 additional multigrade lubricants formulated with the same VI addi- tive. These three parameters and the Newtonian viscosity of these oils at 150°C predicted high temperature- high shear values at 104, 105, and 106s with the same precision as direct measurement with the Penn State high temperature, high shear viscometer. Conse- quently, this paper presents a method of predicting blend properties from a simple calibration system for blends of a single VI polymer in a relatively homogeneous set of base oils. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940821. Prediction of the anti-shudder properties of auto- matic transmission fluids using a modified SAE No. 2 machine. Hiroko Ohtani, Rolfe J. Hartley, and Dennis W. Stinnett, Ethyl Petroleum Additives, Inc. One of the barriers to successful implementation of the continu- ous slip torque converter clutch (CSTCC) design for automatic transmissions (AT) is transmission shudder. An important factor contributing to shudder is the frictional characteristics of the auto- matic transmission fluid (ATF). In this paper, we report the develop- ment of a test that allows the precise measurement of the frictional characteristics of the ATF at different sliding speeds (p-v data) using a SAE No. 2 friction machine. A conventional SAE No. 2 machine was modified, by installing a DC static drive motor, to sim- ulate the sliding speeds, surface pressures, and fluid temperatures found in actual vehicle operating conditions. The p-v data obtained with the machine showed good correlation with the vehicle shudder, i.e., the ATFs showing more negative gradient in the p-v data caused more severe shudder in the vehicle. Initial shudder and anti- shudder durability evaluations were conducted using a variety of commercial and experimental ATFs. It was found that the highly friction-modified ATFs exhibited good initial anti-shudder perfor- mance. ATFs meeting major North American OEM requirements were not always acceptable for CSTCC applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940822. Wear and life prediction of cam roller follower. W. Cheng and H. S. Cheng, Northwestern Univ.; and Yoshiteru Yasuda, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Experimental and analytical research were performed on the con- tact fatigue wear of cam roller follower (needle roller bearing). A new fatigue test machine with a special two-bar loading system was designed to increase the efficiency and the reliability of the tests. The performance test indicated that the end clearance between the roller and rocker had a significant influence on friction and heat gen- eration in the roller follower. The nondestructive testing procedure showed that there were possibly three wear mechanisms in the were process, but the dominant one was subsurface crack initiation and propagation. Based on the observed wear mechanism two crack ini- tiation dominate contact fatigue models were used to predict the wear life. The life prediction parameters were determined from sta- tistic analysis of the experiment data. The Lundberg-Palmgren model predicts shorter lives and does not fit with the experiment 104</page><page sequence="104">940822-940828 data.

Gervase Mackay, D. Karecki, H. Schiff, and J. Bechara, Unisearch Associates, Inc. Absorption Spectroscopy with tunable diode lasers in the infra- red has become a standard technique for the chemical analysis of gases. Some of the advantages offered by this technique are specific- ity, sensitivity and fast response. Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) has a spectral resolution narrower than doppler line widths, which permits positive identification and unequivocal measurements of components in complex gas mixtures as well as providing an ideal reference standard against which other, less definitive techniques can be compared. Its high resolution makes real-time isotope ratio measurements possible. Instrumentation has been developed to exploit these advantages for the chemical analysis of gas mixtures in various environments. TDLAS systems are now available with a detection limit as low as 25 pptv and a dynamic range of more than 4 orders of magnitude. This permits measurements of species in pristine environments or trace constituents in more polluted air. The rapid time response of these systems has been used to make eddy correlation flux measure- ments and to get good spatial resolution from fast moving aircraft. TDLAS measurements have been used in the very clean troposphere and in the stratosphere, in polluted urban and rural air, in smog chambers, landfills, industrial sites and indoor work places and in automobile exhausts. Systems have been deployed on mobile vans, ships, aircraft, balloons and rockets. In this paper, the principles and requirements of TDLAS are briefly discussed, and a typical instrument described with some cur- rent and future technical developments. Some applications of TDLAS are also presented with the results of recent field measure- ments. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940825. (SP- 10 14) Dynamic laser analysis of exhaust gas. Wolfgang Thiel and Walter Hiibner, BMW AG; and Roland Grisar, Wolfgang J. Riedel, and Helmut Wolf Fraunhofer-Institut. In order to achieve the emission levels required for Low Emis- sion Vehicles (LEV) and Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV) it is necessary to obtain insight into emission reactions to the motor management systems during transient engine performance. The optimization of transients in typical driving profiles, such as shift- ing, acceleration load reversal, necessitates suitable gas measure- ment equipment. A technique capable to resolve one combustion cycle consists in spectroscopic gas analysis by using tunable infrared diode lasers. This paper describes the available equipment and demonstrates that a diode laser system fulfills the specific demands for the analysis of transient operating characteristics of engine management sys- tems. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940826. (SP- 1014) Fast multicomponent exhaust gas analyzer for dynamic exhaust measurements. Rüdiger Frey, Holger Nagel, and Jochen Franzen, Bruker- F ranzen Analytick GmbH; Hugo ABet- zold and Walter Ulke, Dornier GmbH; and Ulrich Boesl, Technical University of Munich. A sensitive laser mass spectrometer has been developed for fast multicomponent automotive exhaust analyses. The system is partic- ularly appropriate for working at dynamic motor test stands and pro- vides the following features: 1) detection of all individual organic and inorganic exhaust constituents with lppm sensitivity, 2) simul- taneous detection of up to 12 selectable exhaust compounds with a measurement rate of up to 100Hz, 3) 2ms time precision relative to the motor phase, and 4) ruggedness for operation at engine test facil- ities. This system has been used at a motor test facility to investigate the emissions of aromatic hydrocarbons benzene, toluene, xylene, and of nitrogen oxide in stationary and dynamic engine operation. These measurements demonstrate some of the capabilities of the analysis system to obtain fundamental information about the com- bustion processes and about processes in the exhaust pipe. This is essential for the development of the engine and engine control sys- tems and other efforts to reduce emission of pollutants. 940827. (SP- 1014) Development of a single run method for the determination of individual hydrocarbons (C2-C12) in auto- motive exhaust by capillary gas chromatography. N. Rädlein, W. Geiger, N. Pelz , and H. -J. Scherrbacher, Mercedes-Benz AG. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has proposed pro- cedures for the analysis of non-methane organic gases (NMOG) to determine the ozone forming potential (OFP) of automotive exhaust. For realization of these methods two differently configured GC sys- tems are necessary. In order to reduce the efforts concerning costs, maintenance and quality control of two analytical instruments, a sin- gle run method is developed for routine analysis. This method allows identification and quantification of individual hydrocarbons (IHC) in the range of carbon number C2 to CI 2. Analytical problems arising from high contents of water and car- bon dioxide in exhaust samples are discussed. Water reduction is obtained by a Nafion® Dryer by means of membrane diffusion of polar compounds. Contamination as well as memory effects due to this sample work up are described. Sample pre-concentration of 50- 200 mL diluted automotive exhaust is performed using triple phase "mixed bed" adsorption tube at 0°C. The enriched IHC are ther- mally desorbed, cryogenicly focused on a glass beads filled cryo trap and subsequently injected in to the GC system. To avoid plug- ging of the cryo trap by freezing CO: and remaining H20 the adsorp- tion tube is pre-flushed with helium at slightly elevated temperatures prior to the actual thermal desorption. Adequate separation effi- ciency over the wide range of C2/C12 in a single run requires the application of two separation columns combined via the "Deans type" column switching. Light-end species (C2-C5) are separated on a AI2O3/KCI PLOT column, whereas mid-range species (C6- C12) are eluted simultaneously from a CP-SiL-5 CB column. The moment of column switching is adjustable according to the analyti- cal problem. During method development the identification of the individual components is performed by means of single gas stan- dards (C &lt; 4) GC/MSD and/or comparison with chromatograms of GC standard reference mixtures (C&gt; 5) respectively. A chromato- gram of an automotive exhaust sample as well as limits of detection and blank contributions of the analytical system are presented. Scope and limitations of the method are described. In spite of an already semi automatic application delivering results of high analyt- ical quality, some further work has to be done on additional identifi- cation of compounds, optimization of adsorbent mixture, and solv- ing he problem of too high ethyne quantification. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940828. (SP- 1014) Recent developments in on line continuous gas analyzers used for low emission vehicle testing. Roland Aldridge and AI Roddan, Ro semolini Analytical Inc. Recent changes in the Federal Clean Air Act have spawned the concept of the Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV). In turn, higher preci- sion measurements on lower levels of exhaust emissions, brought on by these new vehicles, has changed requirements placed on mod- ern emissions analyzers. By changing the way analyzers are viewed in the system and through the use of modern micro computers, the integrity of information put into the database is greatly improved in the next generation of emission analyzers. This paper discusses design issues addressed during the develop- ment of modern gas analyzers used for the measurement of exhaust emissions. 105</page><page sequence="105">940829-940836 940829. (SP- 101 8) ABS - Extending the range. Thomas P. Mathues , ITT Automotive Brake Systems. Anti-lock brake system development is expanding on four major fronts. The first is to improve the solutions economically to extend the range of usage into the lowest cost vehicles. The second is to continue to improve the usage of available traction under complex real road conditions to extend the range of performance. The third is to continue the pattern of up- integration with other systems to extend the range of value in the vehicle and the last is to use emerg- ing technology to improve the interface of vehicle capability with driver ability to extend the range of real situation utilization of avail- able performance. This paper discusses the different technologies that will drive the system changes in the future and some expectations for future levels of performance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940830. (SP- 101 8) Fuzzy logic continuous and quantizing control of an ABS braking system. Georg F. Mauer , Universit y of Nevada ; and Gérard F. Gissinger and Yann Chamaillard, Université de Huaute Alsace. This paper discusses means to adapt the braking pressure to changing road conditions by analyzing the relation between brake torque and slip ratio in real time. No additional sensory inputs are used. The fuzzy logic controller and a decision logic network iden- tify the current road condition, based on current and past readings of the slip ratio and brake pressure. The controller detects wheel blockage immediately and avoids excessive slipping. The fuzzy logic controller output signal represents the brake torque applied to the vehicle. The ABS system performance is examined on a quarter vehicle model with nonlinear elastic suspension. The parallelity of the fuzzy logic evaluation process ensures rapid computation of the controller output signal, requiring both less time and fewer compu- tation steps than controllers with adaptive identification. Two actua- tor types are investigated, one with a customary quantizing charac- teristic, and the other capable of generating continuous braking pres- sure variations. The paper describes design criteria, the decision and rule structure of the control system, and presents simulation results on various road types, and under rapidly changing road conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940831. (SP- 101 8) Analysis of traction control systems aug- mented by limited slip differentials. Robert K. Holzworth and Kenneth A. May, Zexel-Gleason USA, Inc. Traction Control Systems (TCS's) are becoming increasingly present in today's automobiles. These systems strive to improve the traction and stability characteristics of the vehicle by actively con- trolling wheel slip. Limited Slip Differentials (LSD's) offer a pas- sive method (no control system required) of improving the traction and stability of the vehicle, by appropriately proportioning wheel torque. This paper will investigate the compatibility of these two approaches by demonstrating the function and performance of vari- ous LSD/TCS combinations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940832. (SP- 101 8) Consideration of lateral and longitudinal vehicle stability by function enhanced brake and stability con- trol system. Heinz Leffler, BMW AG. The Dynamic Stability Control DSC is a BMW stability and trac- tion control system. To overcome performance limits of conven- tional systems which rely on wheel speed sensor information only, the DSC was extended by the steering wheel position signal. The new system allows a classification of self steering behavior and thus leads to a better recognition of the respective driving situa- tion. Control commands of the three control circuits throttle, ignition and brake lead to considerably better stabilization of the car during critical driving maneuvers. The BMW 850 Ci is available with DSC. The DSC was com- pared with the conventual Automatic Stability Control System ASC under various test conditions on high- and low-p. surfaces. Test results are presented and discussed. A system description together with the theoretical background of the DSC is given. 1 994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940833.

The sensor comprises a weight, a pair of flat springs, a magnetic circuit, an optical system and an electric circuit. The weight consists of a torquer coil and a pair of damper plates. In order to reduce the cost, we developed a unique construction suitable for mass production.

(SP- 1018) Automated software verification support- ing ABS-TCS safety design. Torsten Sauer, ITT- Automotive Europe. A constant growth of ABS-TCS software activities and the resulting demand for software verification lead to the design of a programmable verification system. The system was designed to take up any ABS-TCS controller electrically the same way a car does, including the option of generat- ing every type of fault possible from outside the controller. To run verification procedures, a simplified test processing lan- guage was created along with a real-time sequencer. Results are acquired by monitoring ABS- TCS-Controller lines, and communicating with the built-in self diagnosis of the controller. Additional software exists for the evaluation of the result data. Running fully automated, 350 ABS-TCS tests have already become part of the official software release process. Built to be easily upgraded and adaptive to changes, the system is intended to cope with future ABS-TCS development. It even pro- vides not only for preprogrammed or field recorded test patterns to be run, but also for hazard seeking algorithms to be developed and performed. 940835. (SP-1018) The "Variable Flow Valve" (VFV) for electronically controlled hydraulic systems. Koichi Hashida and Masato Yoshino, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEI) has developed the "Variable Flow Valve" (=VFV), which is small, low cost, and suitable for the precise control of hydraulic systems. With the VFV, the hydraulic flow can be regulated continuously by controlling the electric current. The VFV is able to regulate the flow of low viscosity fluid under high pressure; in the low flow range; smoothly, quietly, and with quick response. We are confident that the performance and reliability of the VFV allow it to be applied to vehicle brake systems, and also hope to find applications to other hydraulic systems. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940836.

Gissinger, Institut de Recherche Polytechnique; and C. Menard, Thomson-CSF. This article presents the results obtained in regulating complex physical systems of low time-constants, often less than a second or even a tenth of a second. Special emphasis is placed on unstable sys- tems or those that may become such in certain working conditions. These systems which are difficult to regulate require special pre- cautions in real industrial uses. Different algorithms such as controls using PID (Proportional plus Integrator plus Derivator controller) or pole placement, adaptive controls or, in some cases generalized pre- dictive controls, have been tested and compared. In the case of adaptive controls, special care is given to the prob- lem of parameter initialization which is often crippling for such uses as the ones described here. A compromise between implementation and operation costs, calculation time, performance, etc., must be found. Our application is a real industrial example: the braking system of a vehicle. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940838. (SP-1018) A new multipurpose servo valve for fast applications. Christian Menard, Thomson-CSF. Actuator technology is changing fast and most manufacturers are endeavoring to cut down on costs of studies and produce products in series. It can be said that actuators govern the action faculties of "mus- cles" in applications. Depending on the area, actuators are consid- ered to be slow, semi-fast, fast or otherwise control influx: flow, action, pressure, power, strength. There is a large family of actuators but it is indeed incomplete for many years because many applications require fast actuators capable of using relatively high flows and pressure levels at accept- able costs. For instance, flows ranging from 0,16 to 0,5 dm3/s, pres- sures of 100 to 300 X 105Pa on pressure loads of 20Hz to 30Hz band- width. Today, the main clients are users of aircraft and automobile brakes and other industrial areas. This article is aimed at provided professionals with information about fast acting actuator technology in the form of new multipur- pose servo valve for fast applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940839. Comparison of turbocharger performance between steady flow and pulsating flow on engines. Masanori Iwasaki, Nobuyuki Ikeya, Youichi Marutani, and Toshihiko Kitazawa, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. In the Fields of the internal combustion engines for automobile and marine use, higher output power, higher efficiency and lower fuel consumption are strongly expected. The problems of environ- ment such as a global greenhouse effect or an acid rain is getting worse. Therefore the exhaust gas regulations had been introduced and being strengthen in the USA, Europe and Japan. These regula- tions demand the reduction of NOx and particulate matter (PM) from diesel exhaust gas at the same timé. The turbocharging has been more important technique for these regulations. For automo- bile engines, it is common to use the pulse turbocharging system for compactness and advantage of response. The characteristics of com- pressor and turbine are different from under steady state condition by pulsating flow. Especially, it is difficult to estimate the perfor- mance of turbine mounted on engine by using the map measured under steady state flow. It is the key point to know the difference of characteristics between on engine condition and steady state condition. It helps one to develop the high performance turbocharging and to select the optimum turbocharger specification. Many researchers had investi- gated the characteristics of turbocharger under non-steady flow con- ditions. Most of them used the pulse generator to simulate the exhaust pulse of engine. They relate the characteristics of turbo- charger on engine condition to steady state performances with quasi steady state method. For this method, they use the instantaneous tur- bine inlet and outlet pressure, temperature and mass flow rate. These approaches, which use the instantaneous data, are not suitable to one, who want to select the turbocharger specification to a target engine. Usually they cannot get such data. They can get the informa- tion such as number of cylinders and type of exhaust manifold arrangement. It is desirable that they can estimate the turbocharger performance on the engine without any instantaneous data. Authors used the actual engines instead of a pulse generator to compare the flow and efficiency characteristics between on engine condition and steady state condition. From results of these approaches, it is found that engines having the same exhaust system have the same tendency of mass flow and efficiency correction coef- ficient for the turbine expansion ratio. From results of the measure- ments of degree of reaction in a turbine scroll, the amplitude of vari- ation measured on engine is greater than for steady state flow. It means that the estimate with quasi steady state approach for non- steady state flow condition brings some errors. 940840. Application of crankcase-supercharging to a 4-stoke cycle compression ignition engine. Naoki Okanishi and Itarn Fukutani, University of Industrial Technology. In order to boost the torque of a 4-stoke cycle diesel engine, a crankcase-supercharged 4-stroke cycle diesel engine was made and tested in the Firing mode. As a result, a remarkable reduction of smoke density and brake specific fuel consumption compared with the naturally aspirated baseline diesel engine was obtained. Additionally, a Jet Air Port (JAP), which was opened and closed by piston movement near bottom dead center was installed. The JAP utilized air furnished by the crankcase-supercharging system. A reduction of smoke density and brake specific fuel consumption compared with the naturally-aspirated baseline diesel engine was found. 940841.

In order to investigate transient characteristics of crankcase- supercharged 4-stroke cycle engines, such engines were installed in both a motorcycle and a passenger car for on-road test. It was found that, in the starting and the passing acceleration tests, the engine speeds of the crankcase- supercharged engines increased more rapidly than that of the naturally-aspirated engine. Additionally, in 0-200m acceleration tests, the crankcase- supercharged motorcycle's time was 4.7 sec (approximately 16%) faster than that of the naturally-aspirated motorcycle. 940842. Turbo-compound cooling systems for heavy-duty diesel engines. W. E. Woollenweber, Turbo Design, Inc. Fan-radiator cooling systems for diesel engines have experienced only minor changes in basic design since their inception. However, the increase in power output over decades of development of the engine has forced the cooling system to become larger, more com- plex and more expensive. Problems of fan noise, low system effi- ciency, durability and safety persist. The thermodynamic basis for the design of a new cooling system for heavy-duty diesel engines is presented in this paper. The new system consists of an exhaust gas turbine driving a high-speed ducted fan to provide cooling air for engine and vehicle heat exchangers. Since the turbo-fan is not mechanically connected to the engine, the components can be located in more convenient places that favor vehicle aerodynamics, operator visibility and operational safety. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 107</page><page sequence="107">940843-940848 940843.

For the realization of such engines, the high efficiency Lysholm (screw type) compressor was developed and its mass-production has been started, which can produce high pressure boost for the engine in whole engine speed range. This compressor has achieved high volumetric efficiency and the adequate durability for automotive use has also been confirmed through various kinds of tests. 940844. An observation and analysis of the combustion under supercharging on a DI diesel engine. Long Zhang, Toshiaki Takat- suki, and Katsuhiko Yokata, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Center, Ltd. Supercharging as the method of increasing the output of diesel engines has a long history. Recently because the potential for lower exhaust emission for a given power output, supercharging has been considered as a method to reach increasingly strict emission stan- dards. Some research investigating the effect of supercharging has shown favorable results in terms of emissions. Also some funda- mental studies have examined the effect of ambient pressures on the characteristics of spray and ignition in constant volume combustion bomb. However, for further improvement of combustion when uti- lizing supercharging, more detailed information inside the combus- tion chamber is needed about the effects of supercharging on fuel spray and combustion. In order to gather this information, it is nec- essary to observe the processes within the combustion chamber of a supercharged engine. From these observations, an analysis can be made based on both the real processes and the changes in engine performance and emissions. Optical access to the diesel combustion chamber has been achieved since the mid 1930's. High speed direct combustion pho- tography and shadowgraph, when applied to diesel engines, can give insight into spray penetration and breakup, ignition phenomena, local A/F ratios, and flame spreading rates. More detailed informa- tion such as flame motion and flame temperature can also be avail- able by means of the cross correlation method and the two-color method. In an effort to gain insight on the effects of supercharging on fuel spray and combustion, a study has been performed on an optically accessible DI diesel engine. Through the use of a combustion cham- ber visualization system and photograph processing; changes in fuel spray, ignition and combustions due to supercharging have been revealed. Flames motion and temperature have been measured for a range of boost pressures while other parameters were held cons- tant. Based on the results of combustion analysis, the effects of super- charging on the combustion and the methods related to combustion improvement have been discussed. In addition, the changes of com- bustion characteristics were shown to correlate well with changes in engine performance and emissions. 940845. Introducing a high efficiency variable positive dis- placement automotive supercharger. Ski Muir Milburn, Vairex Corp. A variable, positive displacement supercharge, (VPDS™) is being developed for diesel and spark ignition engines. Benefits include reduced emission, improved fuel economy and low speed torque improvements. Three US Patents have been issued on the concept, which is based on radially arranged rectangular pistons with pressure com- pensated seals. Displacement is varied by adjusting the eccentricity of the piston drive under control of engine electronics. Design pressure can be delivered at all operating speeds while power consumption is proportional to air mass and pressure deliv- ery. Overall Compressor efficiencies of 85% have been demon- strated, making the VPDS™ the highest efficiency supercharger known. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940846. (SP- 1010) Lightweight magnesium composites for automotive applications. Timothy E. Wilks, Magnesium Elektron. The need for low density, high stiffness materials has led to the production of magnesium based metal matrix composites using a variety of particles and whiskers as reinforcements . Examples are silicon carbide particles and whiskers, boron carbide particles and chopped alumina fibers. To date most of the techniques used to pro- duce these composite materials have utilized expensive processing technologies such as powder expensive processing technologies such as powder metallurgy, and are only available as wrought prod- ucts. In order to address the requirements of he automotive industry, Magnesium Elektron has developed a process which combines sili- con carbide particles with magnesium alloys in the liquid state, to produce a lower-cost castable MMC product. This composite has an increased stiffness of 50% higher than conventional magnesium and by controlling the ceramic content of the composite the physical properties such as CTE can also be varied to suit the specific appli- cation. The composite can be produced in the form of foundry ingot and can be re-melted using a modification to conventional fluxless mag- nesium melting technology, provided that simple precautions are taken to prevent contamination and settling-out. Most casting pro- cesses will be appropriate to use with this material. This paper will review the development of castable reinforced magnesium alloys at MEL, and will discuss the properties and potential applications of these materials. 940847. (SP- 10 10) Development of aluminum powder metal- lurgy composites for cylinder liners. Eitarou Koya, Yoshitoshi Hagiwara, and Seishi Miura, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Tetsya Hayashi, Toshio Fujiwara, and Mineo Onoda, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. There are several all-aluminum cylinder blocks. A typical exam- ple is a mono-block cylinder of alusil alloy produced by low pres- sure die casting. This material's resistance to abrasion and seizure, however, is not satisfactory for motorcycle; in addition, long pro- cessing time is another disadvantage. To cope with these problems, the authors developed a light and highly productive all-aluminum cylinder block with a cast-in liner through die casting. The liner is made from powder metallurgy com- posite (PMC) with 3 to 5% alumina and 0.5 to 3% of graphite addi- tives. The PMC reconciles abrasion resistance and machinability. The hardness deterioration of the composite due to the heat at die casting is avoided by using heat-resistant rapidly-solidified pow- ders, made from an aluminum-silicon iron alloy, for the matrix. By employing the sliding test and the firing test, PMC showed similar abrasion resistance to grey iron and similar seizure resistance to iron plating under the boundary lubricated condition. Furthermore, the machinability is improved by the use of fine spherical alumina parti- cles of average diameter of 3p.m. 940848. (SP- 1010) Performance of MMC rotors in dynamom- eter testing. Ratnesh Dwivedi, Lanxide Corp. Automotive brake rotors produced from metal matrix composites (MMCs) were subjected to dynamometer tests. The thermal response during fade stops, the failure temperature, and the wear performance of the rotors were studied as functions of various mate- rial and design parameters, such as rotor thickness, composition of the rotors, inertial load, and cooling air speed. The performance of the MMC rotors was also compared with that of commercially avail- able production cast iron rotors. The data related to the maximum operating temperature (MOT) as a function of the silicon carbide 108</page><page sequence="108">940848-940856 level in a composite rotor is also presented. The testing indicates that metal matrix composite materials may be strong candidates for brake rotors in future models of motor vehicles. 940849. (SP- 1010) Fabrication and properties of metal matrix composites for automotive brake caliper applications. Michael K. Aghajanian, George C. Altland , Peggy Barron-Antolin, and Alan S. Nagelberg, Lanxide Corp. Metal matrix composites were produced by the PRIMEX™ pres- sureless metal infiltration process. Properties of the composites were determined as a function of particulate loading, filler type, alloy chemistry, and test temperature. Using the property data, a generic brake caliper bridge geometry was designed and modeled. The results of the modeling suggested that composite caliper bridges can be equivalent in stiffness to ductile iron components at only 43% of the mass, and equivalent in stiffness to aluminum components at only 60% of the mass. In addition, composites containing unenfor- ced regions (i.e., areas without ceramic particulates) were fabricated to facilitate drilling and tapping at attachment locations. The strength of the threads in these regions was evaluated and compared with thread strengths in iron, Al alloy, and monolithic metal matrix composite. 940850. (SP- 1010) Development of co-continuous ceramic composite materials for specific applications. J. Ringnalda, M. C. Breslin, J. Seeger, D. Le Jeune , G. S. Daehn, and H. L. Fraser, Ohio State Univ. The process of producing co-continuous ceramic composite material has been investigated in order to provide a greater under- standing of the formation mechanism and hence evaluate the viabil- ity of commercial applications for these exciting new materials. The ease of manufacture for components combined with the low produc- tion cost hold great promise for the production of brake rotors, brake calipers, piston crowns, cylinder liners, gears and turbine compres- sors. Practical issues such as bonding to this material, together with the machinability have been addressed, our findings ar presented in this paper. 940852. (SP- 1010) Improved engine performance via use of nickel ceramic composite coatings (NCC Coat). K. Funatani and K. Kurowawa, Nihon Parkerizing Co.; and P. A. Fabiyi and M. F. Puz, Daubert Chemical Co. In seeking to produce lightweight aluminum block based engines, a variety of metallurgical and surface modification tech- niques for cylinder bores, pistons, and piston rings are available. This paper discusses these various alternative methods while plac- ing particular emphasis on electroplated nickel ceramic composite coatings (NCC). NCC Coating properties are characterized by high hardness, high corrosion resistance, high temperature wear and scuff resistance and low frictional coefficients. The application of NCC Coatings in 2-stroke motorcycle and die- sel engines has resulted in benefits in the following areas: elimina- tion of cast iron liners; reduced cylinder wall temperature, engine weight and increased power; lowering of oil consumption; improved fuel economy; reduction in emissions; improved scuff and wear resistance on cylinder bores, pistons and piston rings; friction reduc- tion; combating of piston ring groove microwelding and pound out; thermal barrier protection on diesel piston domes; reduction in car- bon deposition on piston domes; reduced noise from piston slap; and ability to operate in corrosive environments. The sum of the above stated benefits hold much potential for con- tributing towards greater flexibility in materials selection for the design of lightweight, fuel efficient vehicles based upon the use of aluminum engines. 940853. (SP- 1010) High performance heat sink fabrication issues. John E. Cronin and Henry F. Breit, Texas Instruments Incor- porated. Advances in high performance electronics have resulted in the need to develop fabrication processes for a variety of exotic new materials. In order to tailor desired thermal performance characteris- tics, the materials designer has relied on metal matrix systems with refractory metal or ceramic basis. The ease of fabrication formerly experienced with lower performance Nickel-Iron systems could no longer be realized. A novel material system will be discussed where the perfor- mance of Nickel-Iron based alloys is augmented through the selec- tive addition of high performance silver. This system competes favorably with the refractory metal and ceramic based systems while offering significant fabrication advantages. The Nickel-Iron system readily adapts to a list of standard metal- lurgical fabrication processes. Two processes in particular, i.e., machining and plating will be addressed. Standard machining opera- tions were performed on a variety of metal matrix systems. Relative material removal rates, tool wear, surface finish, and machining costs are reported herein. These same materials were subjected to standard plating tests and overall processing costs developed. The conclusion addresses the relative fabrication costs for each of the material systems investigated. 940855. A comparison of experimental high irradiance and standard SAE weathering tests for automobile exterior materi- als. Lesley Crewdson, South Florida Test Service; and Kurt Scott, Atlas Electric Devices Co. The speed, precision and reproduction of real world effects are the key factors which make an excellent accelerated weathering test. A great deal of time and money is constantly expended by industry in scrutiny of these points to improve the quality of test design. A new approach in accelerated weathering is to test at higher irradi- ance to increase speed in preference to the use of short wavelength light which does not exist in the natural environment. A new test method and filter system have been developed in order to increase the speed and quality of xenon arc testing. The results obtained from this new test are compared with several currently used test standards and with results obtained from five years of Florida outdoor testing. The results showed that the new test method correlated as well with the Florida tests as the standard methods, with the exception of the L* scale color change. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940856. A study of the color change of automotive coatings subjected to accelerated and natural S.A.E. weathering tests for exterior materials durability. Monica Verma, General Motors Corp.; and Lesley F. E. Crewdson, South Florida Test Service. Exposrue of automobile exterior materials such as coatings in the South Florida environment has become the de facto standard for testing their durability. In the early thirties, testing sites were estab- lished in this location by the automotive industry. Each automobile manufacturer applied different exposure techniques for their own acceptance criteria. SAE J 1976 was developed in 1989 to standard- ize the various exposure types, however, the document still contains radically different test rack designs. Even though the Florida exposure tests have not changed exten- sively the coatings have become much more durable. Today's ser- vice life expectation of more than 5 years means that the coating cannot be tested to failure in the Florida environment and allow the developer to bring a new technology to the marketplace in a timely and competitive manner. This has led to the use of accelerated tests to speed up the exposure process. There are several alternative tests specified by SAE including xenon arc Weather-Ometer® (SAE J 1 960), Fresnel reflector device (SAE J 1 96 1 ) and fluorescent testing device (SAE J2020). The study reported here was carried out to draw conclusions regarding differences between the outdoor test racks designs and their relationship to the accelerated test methods, in order to identify the accelerated test providing the best correlation to Florida. Speci- mens were donated by three automotive coating manufacturers, rep- resenting a combination of coating types and colors in the form of 109</page><page sequence="109">940856-940861 coated test panels. Seventy specimens were exposed per test method. Performance evaluations including the measurement of color, were conducted several times during the exposure testing. Comparative color change data is reported for all of the test methods and statistical comparison are made between each. The results showed that the best correlation was achieved when the light source most closely matched sunlight. All of the outdoor tests correlated well with each other. 940857. High solids polyurethane coatings for automotive plastics. Scott A. Grace and Douglas A. Wicks, Miles Inc. Two component, flexible polyurethane coatings are used as pro- tective and aesthetic coatings for many automotive plastic applica- tions. Adjusting the coating flexibility to match the flexibility of the plastic allows the coated plastic to retain the impact resistance of the uncoated plastic. New developments in polyurethane chemistry allow the formulation of coating with much lower VOC's than con- ventional flexible polyurethanes. These low VOC, flexible, polyure- thane coatings exhibit improved room temperature polish ability. This technology also shows the potential to yield coatings with improved environmental etch resistance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940858. Development in U.V. curable coatings for automotive plastics. James E. Fleischer, Red Spot Paint &amp; Varnish Co., Inc. In the past five to ten years, there have been many new and help- ful coating and processing technologies made available to the auto- motive engineer The most common of the current technologies include vacuum metallizing systems for headlamp and taillamp reflectors. Accom- pany the reflectors are plastic lenses coated with scratch resistant coatings to protect and sustain the assemblies. Included also are turn signal housings, claddings and moldings, all of which require coat- ing protection. Sound engineering and processing are most important for pro- ducing quality products. U.V. curable coatings require certain radia- tion dosages to afford proper cure, and thus dictate input from engi- neering, processors, equipment and coatings suppliers in order to do the job adequately. Contemporary automotive manufacturing demands the marriage of all constituents to insure that "Quality is Job 1". New and exciting technology is continually being discovered to enable U.V. curable coatings to be not only one of the fastest grow- ing current technologies, but is expected to increase in specification and consumption in the future as well. High temperature resistant reflector coatings will allow for more streamlined designs. Coatings are being developed to maintain low gloss control on instrument panel cladding to provide anti- glare surfaces for the customer. Curing coatings by high intensity ultraviolet light makes the future of high performance automotive plastic components exciting an innovative to our industry. Prior to discussing new development in U.V. curable coatings, one must have an understanding of certain foundation definitions and principles. When referring to coatings systems the three basic categories are: A.) Lacquer- has its' ultimate properties when the carrier (solvent or water) is evacuated from the film. B.) Varnish - cures by oxidation/polymerization of the oil length portion of the coating. C.)Enamel - undergoes an actual crosslinking, or conversion, of multiple constituents to create a new and different molecule. Ultraviolet curing offers a new and exciting technology for pro- ducing resistant, cross-linked coatings. Baking enamels have long been utilized as high-quality finishes for products that requires stability, such as headlamp reflectors. Typically, enamels are applied by spray or flowcoating and require a high temperature for cross-linking or curing. Typically 30-60 minutes at 250°-400°F is common for curing, depending upon the enamel and the substrate. As one can see by the curing schedule, incredible energy costs, tooling and labor penalties would be realized to effect a high volume production line with enamels. The passage of the Clean Air Act in the Mid- 1970' s restricted solvent usage with conventional coatings (approximately in the 18-28% solids range at application) therefore forcing the utilization of coatings with less volatiles (more in the 30-40% solids range). Even newer air pollution legislation in California is so severe that the small amount of coupling solvents found in latex paint is said to be too great a concentration. Very soon governmental regulation will force decorating indus- tries to use 60-70% solids-coatings, thus heavily restricting solvent emission. Ultraviolet cured coatings possess superior physical properties such as: A.) Chemical resistance to solvents, oils stains, perfumes and perspiration. B,) Abrasion resistance using test media such as Taber Abrasion and 0000 steel wool. C.) Hardness and scratch resis- tance (4-6H pencil hardness). D.) Improved exterior durability for plastics that yellow when tested to QUV and Weather-O-Meter environments. E.) Flexibility for impact resistance on automotive engineering plastics as well as recreational equipment. F.) Reduced iridescence, drop-thru and stress cracking with vacuum metallizing due to undercure of the basecoat. Ultra-violet cured coatings greatly enhance speed of curing in seconds versus minutes or hours, increased thru put and reduced floor space for equipment. U.V. coatings also no not distort low- temperature plastics because there is no heat build-up. They have very high reflectivity for vacuum metallized and sputtered parts due to high film build. Higher solids coatings are used, which affords less solvent handling and emissions problems. In short, U.V. curable coatings are a giant technological step forward for many industries. This paper will be concerned about two specific types of U.V. coatings: A.) Vacuum Metallizing Systems for headlamp/taillamp reflectors and interior automotive trim. B.) Clear, protective scratch resistant coatings. 940860. VOC compliant approaches to TPO adhesion pro- moters for exterior coatings applications. Russell F. Pierce, Red Spot Paint and Varnish Co., Inc.; and Wayne Paul Miller, Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics, Inc. Two possible approaches to reducing the VOC of adhesion pro- moters for TPO include: 1) developing a means for lowering the VOC of solvent borne adhesion promoters while maintaining sprayability and performance and 2) development and use of a waterborne adhesion promoter. Initial test results using both of these approaches have proven satisfactory when tested to an exterior auto- motive coating specification. While further testing is still necessary, these approaches have thus far proven themselves as viable methods for reducing the VOC of adhesion promoters for exterior automotive TPO applications. 940861. (SP- 1031) The chassis of the new Porsche 911 Carr- era. Volker Berkefeld and Volker Münz , Porsche AG. One of the essential features of the new Porsche Carrera is its newly developed chassis. It offers a maximum of driving fun and active safety to customers with sporty ambitions. The front axle is a McPherson unit carried over from the predecessor model and hav- ing been thoroughly reworked. Modifications to the axle geometry and kinematics help to improve the straight-line stability and the sta- bility during braking. The rear axle is a newly developed light- weight multi-link unit which offers a maximum of driving stability and agility ("LSA-axle"). The incorporated sub-frame allows to considerably reduce the tire noises. The car is braked by a 4-piston aluminum fixed-caliper power brake system with internally- ventilated brake disks at both the front and rear axles. The new chassis follows the principles of future-oriented light- weight construction which used aluminum wherever this is techni- cally and economically feasible. 110</page><page sequence="110">940862-940868 940862. (SP- 1 03 1 ) Side load springs as a solution to minimize adverse side loads acting on the McPherson strut. Thomas Wüns- che, Mubea Inc.; and Karl-Heinz Muhr, Karl Biecker, and Leo Sch- naubelt, Muhr und Bender. The cost pressure experienced by the automotive industry and the necessity to reduce the vehicle weight have resulted in a renewed and growing interest in axle systems fitted with McPherson struts. Contrary to the SLA front suspension, the McPherson strut replaces the upper steering rod by damper unit, which is rigidly con- nected to the axle legs. The damper unit is fastened to the upper wheel guard by a rubber-metal bearing. The McPherson strut per- mits long spring deflections and provides, compared with the SLA front suspension, an improved transmission ratio of spring and wheel; coordinating the riding comfort is consequently facilitated. However, the damper is subjected to side loads which from time to time cause it to respond inappropriately. To remedy this disad- vantage the side load spring was developed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940863. (SP- 103 1) Development of the semi-active suspension system based on the Sky-hook damper theory. Junichi Emura, Shinobu Kakizaki, Fumiyuki Yamaoka, and Michiya Nakamura, Unisia Jecs Corp. A semi-active suspension system is a system in which the damp- ing coefficient of the suspension damper is controlled actively. This type of system exhibits high performance while having low system cost, light system weight, and low energy consumption. From this viewpoint, the semi-active suspension system is greatly expected to be in the mainstream of future suspension control systems. In this paper, several important points for realizing a semi- active suspension system based on the Sky-hook damper theory will be explained. At the same time, an example of the system developed by us, where the Sky-hook damper has been realized by a simple system configuration, will be shown. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940864. (SP- 1031) Simulation and evaluation of semi-active suspensions. D. Moline, S. Floyd, S. Vaduri, and E. Harry Law, Clemson Univ. A simulation of the vertical response of a nonlinear 1/4 car model consisting of a sprung and an unsprung mass was developed. It is being used for preliminary evaluation of various suspension config- urations and control algorithms. Non-linearities include hysteretic shock damping and switchable damping characteristics. Road inputs include discrete events such as bumps and potholes as well as ran- domly irregular roads having specified power spectral densities (PSDs). Fast Fourier transform data analysis procedures are used to pro- cess data from the simulation to obtain PSDs, rms values, and histo- grams of various response quantities. To aid in assessing ride com- fort, the 1/3 octave band rms acceleration of the sprung mass is cal- culated and compared with specifications suggested by the Interna- tional Standards Organization (ISO). Cross plots of the rms values of acceleration, suspension travel, and the force fo the road on the tire are used to compare the performance of various suspensions. These systems include semi-active systems with either on/off or continuously variable damping, passive systems, and an ideal sky- hook system. These and other post processing procedures together with associated plotting capabilities are integrated with the simula- tion. Example suspensions are compared to illustrate how the designer can utilize a number of ways to evaluate the performance of candi- date designs. In so doing, the designer can obtain an increased phys- ical "feel" for the system and use this increased knowledge to more rapidly develop new systems. ¡994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940865. (SP- 1031) Motion control of the vehicle with an active suspension system. Young Eun Ko and Taell Oh, Kia Motors Corp. The control methods of the vehicle with an active suspension system can be conceptually divided into two categories: ride control and attitude control. A new control method (OPM: Octa- Plate Con- trol Method) is proposed for ride and attitude controls, while most logics for attitude control of active suspension system use lateral/ longitudinal accelerations, OPCM makes use of only vertical accel- erations of four wheels which are commonly used for ride control. OPCM is based on the super position of four 1/4 car controls and four 1/2 car controls. In order to verify the performance of the new method a 7-dof-full-car model including control elements has been built in MATRIXx. The frequency responses and time responses to the bump, cornering/braking inputs have shown that OPCM can reduce heave, roll and pitch motions of the vehicle with good results. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940866.

This paper describes a hydraulic suspension which is shown by simulation to give lower body accelerations and lower dynamic tire forces than a conventional suspension. Eigenvalue analysis is used in help explain how the advanced system simulates an active suspension, operating with a "skyhook" damper control strategy. A 3-dimensional mathematical model is used to explore the performance of the advanced system. Compari- sons with a conventional suspension showed that the advanced sys- tem offers 30% lower ISO weighted, root mean square body vertical acceleration and 10% lower root mean square dynamic tire forces. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940867. (SP- 1031) Magnetic power steering assist system - MAGNASTEER. Andrzej M. Pawlak, NAO Research and Devel- opment Center ; and David W. Graber and Dennis C. Eckhardt, Sag- inaw Division. All commonly used speed sensitive power steering assist systems for cars are based on hydraulics. These systems change the pressure or modulate the flow of the conventional hydraulic power steering system. They require some means of actuation in the form of an electromagnetic device such as a solenoid actuator working as a flow or pressure regulator or brushless motor driving a hydraulic pump. Usually they are pulse width modulated controlled by a microprocessor. Therefore, these systems can be quite complicated. This paper describes MAGNASTEER, a novel magnetic speed sensitive system developed at Saginaw Division in cooperation with the NAO Research and Development Center, which is an add on to the basic hydraulic power steering system. The effort variation pro- vided by MAGNASTEER is the result of an electronically con- trolled electromagnetic torque, which acts as an addition or subtrac- tion to the torsion bar torsional rate, effectively varying the feel of the hydraulic system. Unlike some other variable effort speed- dependent systems based on hydraulics, the MAGNASTEER sys- tem doesn't require additional components such as sensors, hydrau- lic pump controls, or additional hydraulic plumbing. This simple and highly reliable system doesn't interfere with the existing hydraulics, and is fully integrated into the system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940868.

(SP- 1031) A nonlinear parametric model of an auto- motive shock absorber. Koenraad Reybrouck, Monroe Europe. The shock absorber model proposed in this paper is applicable both as part of a full vehicle suspension simulation and as a general way to describe and specify automotive shock absorbers. The parameters of the model correspond to the different physical properties and tuning possibilities of a standard automotive damper. They relate directly to the car behavior on the road, both for han- dling and comfort. The language of ride engineers is used. After identification of the parameters, results of the simulation model cor- respond very well with experiments, for a wide range of dampers and road profiles. The paper presents the algorithm and formulas used in the model and compares simulated and measured damping curves for a typical automotive shock absorber. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940870. (SP- 1031) Comparison of three active chassis control methods for stabilizing yaw moments. Kazuhiko Shimada and Yasuji Shibahata, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Using stabilizing yaw-moment diagrams, the authors analyzed three methods of active chassis control for their effect and effective ranges during cornering maneuvers. The following results were obtained: controlling the transverse distribution of driving and brak- ing forces cancels the changes in a vehicle's dynamic characteristics caused by acceleration and deceleration. Controlling the distribution of roll stiffness is only effective in ranges with high lateral accelera- tion, and the effect varies depending on the longitudinal weight dis- tribution. Controlling the rear wheel steering angle is most effective in a range with a small side slip angle, but this effect decreases with an increase in the angle, especially during deceleration. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940871.

Over the past several decades, vehicle dynamics have been treated mainly on the basis of linear theories. An actual vehicle, however, also shows nonlinear properties such as roll behavior induced by movement of the roll axis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the vehicle roll dynamics in the nonlinear range. Sus- pension were divided into two categories and computer-aided engi- neering (CAE) was used to conduct analyses of complicated kine- matics.

A study on the influences of chassis geometric characteristics on wheel alignment and vehicle dynamic performances has been car- ried out by simulation of two different vehicle models. The vehicles are composed of the same type suspension and tire. They are distin- guished by suspension geometric characteristics, which has led to different wheel alignment static variances and dynamic behavior. These vehicle models, with 130 degrees of freedom, are elaborately tuned to simulate real vehicles. As the results of this study, some of the most important chassis geometric characteristics and wheel alignment, which govern vehicle dynamic performances, have been verified. 940874.

An A356T61 cast aluminum lower suspension control arm has been put into production for the Lincoln Mark VIII. The mechanical requirements which drive the design for a critical part like this are discussed, together with some of the background knowledge needed to address the issues surrounding alloy and process selection. Partic- ularly as it must be realized that the process impacts the degree to which the potential of the alloy can be realized. With this in mind, some of the research activities which have been spawned in parallel with the production activities are briefly covered. The sequence of events involved in the design and prototyping of the part itself are outlined, as is the implementation of a special- ized low pressure casting line to produce the part. Part performance to date has been excellent and the quality controls and test methods which have been put in place to see that this remains so are also cov- ered. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940875. (SP- 101 6) The effect of a viscous coupling used as a front-wheel drive limited-slip differential on vehicle traction and handling. H. Huchtkotter and H. Taureg, GKN Viscodrive GmbH. The viscous coupling is known mainly as a driveline component in four wheel drive vehicles. Developments in recent years, how- ever, point toward the probability that this device will become a major player in mainstream front-wheel drive application. Produc- tion applications in European and Japanese front-wheel drive cars have demonstrated that viscous couplings provide substantial improvements not only in traction on slippery surfaces but also in handling and stability even under normal driving conditions. This paper presents a series of proving ground tests which inves- tigate the effects of a viscous coupling in a front-wheel drive vehicle on traction and handling. Testing demonstrates substantial traction improvements while only slightly influencing steering torque. Fac- tors affecting this steering torque in front- wheel drive vehicles dur- ing straight line driving are described. Key vehicle design parame- ters are identified which greatly influence the compatibility of limit- ed-slip differentials in front-wheel drive vehicles. Cornering tests show the influence of the viscous coupling on the self steering behavior of a front-wheel drive vehicle. Further testing demonstrates that a vehicle with a viscous limited-slip differential exhibits an improved stability under acceleration and throttle-off maneuvers during cornering. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940876. Dynamic behavior of an automotive polyurethane foam under multiple compression cycles. Jackie D. Rehkopf, Uni- versity of Waterloo; Greg M. McNeice, Greenville Hospital System; G. Wayne Brodland, University of Waterloo; and Michael Kerman and Edward T. Kuczyński, Woodbridge Group. Polyurethane foams developed for interior automotive applica- tions were tested to determine their mechanical responses to uniform dynamic compression. Specimens 50x1 00x1 00mm were com- pressed to 25%, 50% or 75% strain at nominal strain rates of 0.14/s to 14/s. From 1 to 100 compression cycles were imposed on the specimens. A recovery period was provided between cycles. In all cases, the foam undergoes cyclic softening. The percent reduction in stress response varies with strain, and is greatest at the low strain levels within each compression cycle. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 112</page><page sequence="112">940877-940883 940877. Utilizing the crushing under load properties of poly- propylene and polyetheylene honeycomb to manage crash energy. John H. Porter , Hexcel Corp. Honeycomb absorbs energy by crushing under load. This charac- teristic has proven to be one of the most reliable and efficient meth- ods of providing "G" limit protection. The action of crushing develops a uniform level of stress near the optimum response desired for energy absorption materials. Energy absorbing designs using honeycomb are presented in several forms. This paper pres- ents a rapid method for calculating preliminary solutions for "G" limit protection. Honeycomb has had application as a calibrated "G" load limiter in test carts and in production steering columns and knee bolsters. Recently a method for continuous production of honeycomb materials from polypropylene and polyethylene (DuPont Tyvek®) called CECORE™ has been developed. These materials are very lightweight with a range of crush strengths and applications. This allows designers to use recyclable base materials in configurations proven to manage energy. The paper discusses examples of how CECORE™ can be used in a vehicle interior. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940879. Dynamic impact testing of polyurethane energy absorbing (EA) foams. David F. Sounik, Dennis W. McCullough, John L. Clemons, and John L. Liddle, Miles Inc. Energy absorbing (EA) materials are used in automobile interiors to help protect occupants from injury in the event of front or side collisions. Depending on their function (shoulder or knee bolster) and location within the automobile (instrument panel or door) differ- ent energy absorbing characteristics may be required. Polyurethane (PU) foam is ideally suited for these applications because of its chemical and design versatility and excellent energy absorbing properties. Routine measurements to characterize EA materials are often performed at relatively low velocity. Collisions which have a high probability of causing occupant injury, however, usually occur at much higher velocities. Because energy managing properties of EA materials can exhibit a dependence on velocity, testing at velocities similar to actual impact velocities is highly desired to accurately characterize a materials' s performance. This paper describes a highly versatile, horizontal dynamic impact sled designed by and in use at Miles Inc. to routinely and quickly characterize EA materials at relatively high impact veloci- ties (15 to 56 kph). The application of the sled to characterize the performance of two different types of polyurethane EA foam under various environmental conditions is also presented. 940880. Constitutive modeling of energy absorbing foams. S. C. Sinha and J. O. Mitchell, Auburn Univ.; and G. G. Lim and C. C. Chou, Ford Motor Co. This paper deals with the constitutive modeling of energy absorbing foams. Two mechanical-analog hyper-elastoplastic mod- els are constructed for simulating the characteristics of semi-rigid and rigid foams. These piecewise linear models are suitable for describing the loading was well as the unloading behavior of mate- rial. The result from quasi-static compression tests are used to deter- mine the three parameters of the models. It is observed that the mod- els can be used in the prediction of stress strain behavior as well as the energy absorption characteristics. 940881. Experimental validation of ellipsoid-to-foam contact model. C.C. Chou, G. G. Lim, S. Sundararajan, T. C. Low, and P. Prasad, Ford Motor Co.; and J. O. Mitchell, Auburn Univ. This report describes an experimental validation of an ellipsoid- to-foam contact model. A series of static foam tests were conducted using Side Impact Dummy rib cage, pelvis, upper leg, and wooden ellipsoids as impactors to validate a theoretical foam contact model previously developed. Predicted results of contact forces, calculated using the uni-axial stress-strain relationship and contact areas, yield good correlation with the test data. These studies used CFC foams and were conducted prior to switching to water-blown foam material development. The ellipsoid-to-foam contact model is being integrated into a MADYMO side impact model. The MADYMO/foam simulation model can then be used to help evaluate design variable tradeoffs (e.g., door thickness versus body side structures and foam padding requirement versus interior package) thereby reducing the current dependency on testing, bolster development time, and cost. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940882. High strain-rate characterization of thermoplastics used for energy management applications. Christopher Clark, GE Plastics ; Paul E. Johnson, University of Dayton; and Colin Frost, Davidson Automotive Technology Center. An interesting characteristic of virtually all materials is their strain-rate sensitivity. In the case of engineering thermoplastics, these materials exhibit ductility and very good impact resistance at low to average strain rates (&gt;10%/sec) but can become extremely brittle and unforgiving at high strain rates (100-5,000+%/sec). This becomes a concern in energy management applications, such as automotive instrument panels and knee bolsters, because, for exam- ple, the average head impact on an instrument panel induces a 1,000%/sec strain rate. Engineering analysis of the impact event typically under- pre- dicts loads and over-predicts deflections. Making material substitu- tions within a design may be of little use since the new candidate may be more strain-rate sensitive than the original polymer. Many of the most widely specified engineering thermoplastics behave very differently in standardized ASTM "static" test than in high strain-rate situations. Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accurately estimate performance based on extrapolated low-strain data. Responding to a need for accurate data measured at high strain rates, and recognizing that very few organizations are equipped to perform such testing, GE Plastics and Davidson Instrument Panel have initiated a research program with the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI) to characterize the strain-rate sensitivity of common grades of polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polycarbonate/acrylonitrile butadiene Styrene (PC/ ABS), polybutylene terphthalate (PBT), polycarbonate/ polybutylene terphthalate(PC/PBT), and modified- polyphenylene ether (M-PPE) resins. This paper will disclose the results of the high strain-rate material testing (up to 5,000%/sec) and resultant performance of these mate- rials. Discussion will center around how engineers can use these data to better predict material behavior in complex assemblies. 940883. Knee bolster analysis of a thermoplastic instrument panel with damage mechanics material law. Kumar Mahadevan, Hań N. Agrawal, and Joseph P. Tekelly, Ford Motor Co. Thermoplastics and composites are increasingly becoming popu- lar among automotive design engineers because of their high spe- cific stiffness and flexibility in manufacturing. While plastics like composites are orthotopic, unfilled thermoplastics like ABS Cycolac may be considered isotropic as thy show little variation in properties between the flow direction and the direction transverse to the flow. However, this assumption is not enough to treat the lat- ter as metals in finite element analysis. Metals like mild steel, offer considerable ductility, while thermoplastics show limited ductility and begin to fracture with several cracks appearing on the surface. Therefore, in the case of such plastics, it is important to consider the degradation of material properties in nonlinear finite element analy- sis using Damage Mechanics material law. This paper offers an insight into the material low used and how it was applied to a Knee Bolster subsystem finite element model to correlate with test data. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 113</page><page sequence="113">940884-940891 940884. (SP- 1035) Restoring the effectiveness of failure modes and effect analysis. Paul Palady, Mark Horvath, and Charles Thomas , Ford Motor Co. New developments on the construction and the analysis of failure modes and effects analysis increase the efficiently of constructing and analyzing FMEA's. These developments also improve the focus on the priorities for achieving the maximum improvements while providing efficient utilization of resources. These enhancements to the FMEA are accomplished by the intro- duction of four new developments; 1) a FMEA input form; 2) an area chart for analysis, competing with the traditional RPN's; 3) a common cause screening matrix and 4) a key cause summary chart. 940885. (SP-1035) Methodology and new tools for reduction of lead-time in product engineering example of H VAC develop- ment. J. Dauvergne, Valeo. The purpose of this paper is to present how new tools enable engineers to go further in the improvements in lead-time, mainly through an "up-stream" integration of numerical data base. It is now possible to consider a fully integrated CAE (modelization), a rapid prototyping process and a fast cost- estimation at early steps of product engineering. The development of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning unit (HVAC) is a good example. The automotive industry requires more and more efficiency in product engineering to achieve objectives of quality, cost and lead- time. The use of modern methodologies based on simultaneous engineering has highly contributed to improve performances of inte- grated project teams for quality goals (QFD, FMEA, experimental plans, etc...), and for reduction of costs (value engineering, value analysis, DFMA, etc...). Improvements in lead-time have been made possible, by development of standardization and approved sources, as well as by generalized use of CAD-CAM for direct transfer of numerical data from the design of parts to the design and machining of tooling or mold. However, engineers now have new tools for different steps of developments, mainly for early design (modelization of air-flow and heat transfer, for HVAC design), rapid prototyping for performance assessment, and rapid costing for major choices. 940887.

It also describes some pitfalls one may encounter, ways to minimize them, and ways to maximize the benefits. The author neither endorses nor advises for or against the use of this methodology as compared to other available methodologies.

(SP-1035) The development and performance simu- lation of polychloroprene high temperature bush type engine mount. Seong-Hoon Lee and Yang-Soo Lim, Hyundai Motor Co. In recent years, high performance engines and the reduction in engine room due to aerodynamic styling has caused increases in engine room temperature. Because of this increasing temperature, the conventional natural rubber engine mount is now at the marginal point on its performance and durability. Several heat resistant mate- rials have been considered for engine mount applications because of this reason. Polychloroprene rubber could be a strong candidate for engine mount application due to its balance of heat resistance, dynamic properties, and fatigue life. This paper will discuss the development of the technology, property characteristics and part performance simulations on the Hyundai Bush Type complex engine mount (for 2.0L DOHC engine). This type of mount requires higher creep resistance and fatigue life than those of other designs, such as block or simple shear type-mounts. Early evaluations of polychloroprene mounts have shown some deficiencies in creep resistance. Therefore to address this concern, the design and formu- lation development to overcome the initial lack of creep resistance of polychloroprene are shown. Also, the effect of heat aging on dynamic characteristics and performance are investigated. All the test results are compared with those of natural rubber mounts. The results will show the possibility of the first application of poly- chloroprene rubber on this type engine mount giving improved fatigue life even after heat aging with balanced dynamic properties. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940889. (SP-1035) Development of a fast pace continuous quality improvement culture. Om P. Gupta, Zexel-Gleason, Inc. As we approach the year 2000, it is not going to be possible for automotive suppliers to survive by just improving. The OEM focus during the 80' s have forced most suppliers to take action in their companies which has resulted in some quality improvements. How- ever, during the 90' s, in order to be world leaders, the supplier must improve at the maximum rate of improvement. Both OEM and sup- plier companies are not able to do this due to significant barriers and obstacles which must be overcome. The solution is development of a fast pace continuous quality improvement culture. Zexel-Gleason, Inc. encountered barriers such as functional, edu- cational, business as usual, lack of customer driven focus, and per- sonality conflicts. With managements' s leadership/involvement and pull through employee participation, a fast pace continuous quality improvement culture has evolved. The results (which include a flex- ible empowered organization where product cost has been reduced by over 40% and where design- proto-test lead time has been reduced by over 300%) have been outstanding. These improvements have clearly been noted by the customers as competitive edge over Zexel-Gleason's competition. In this paper, for the first time, the author will share the lessons learned, during his professional career, to encourage the industry to speed up the rate of improvement and propose his ten (10) Keys (success factors) which he recommends for successfully implanting a Fast Pace Continuous Quality Improvement Culture. 940890. (SP-1035) Development of assembly line verification. Yoshinori Eri, Atshushi Nimi, and Satoshi Ogata, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Bungo Hayashi, Toyota Motor Corporate Services of North America, Inc. To more effectively improve the work on a vehicle assembly line, it is desirable to have a method by which the degree of work load on each person can be evaluated quantitatively; enables us to decide the priority order of improvement; and calculates the improvement effect. We developed a quantitative evaluation method of work load by introducing a concept of physiological stress gener- ated regardless of the type of muscles involved. Applying the bur- den borne by the body to the load evaluation of various assembly operations involved the problem of complex load measuring meth- ods. We solved this problem by categorizing the load conditions for various assembly operations and converting each to a standard state of loads evaluated by experiments. 940891. (SP-1035) Integrated CAE simulation for car dash- board design. Giuseppe Molina and Paolo Smeriglio, Centro Ricerche Fiat. The behavior of an automotive dashboard has been evaluated suing mathematical FEM models in combination with explicit struc- tural codes in accordance with EEC homologation test 78/632. The test simulates the impact of the human head against the dashboard which can occur during a front crash. The simulation of the impact phenomenon in the basic dashboard configuration was examined as related to a series of design variants elaborated to eliminate critical areas. Variations in the stresses were determined in the component in reference to the basic model. An indispensable premise to achieving these results was the exe- cution of FEM process simulations aimed at obtaining the actual dis- tribution of the mechanical strength properties, which were 114</page><page sequence="114">940891-940900 weighted according to the localized influence of different tempera- tures and flow stresses during injection. On the basis of process sim- ulation output data, admissible local strength limits were defined; these limits also took experimental safety coefficients into consider- ation. It was therefore considered appropriate to establish these meth- ods as standard tools for formulating the geometric and technologi- cal features of similar components. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940892. (SP- 1035) Development and application of a shape- topology optimization system using a homogenization method. Toshikazu Torigaki, Ichiro Hagiwara, Yuichi Kitagawa , and Maki Ueda, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Zheng-Dong Ma, and Nohoru Kikuchi, University of Michigan. The shape and topology optimization method using a homogeni- zation method is a powerful design tool because it can treat topolog- ical changes of a design domain. This method was originally devel- oped in 1988 and has been studied by many researchers. However, their scope of application in real vehicle design works has been lim- ited where a design domain and boundary conditions are very com- plicated. The authors have developed a powerful optimization sys- tem by adopting a general purpose finite element analysis code. A method for treating vibration problems is also discussed. A new objective function corresponding to a multi-eigenvalue optimization problem is suggested. An improved optimization algorithm is then applied to solve the problem. Applications of the optimization sys- tem to design the body and the parts of a solar car are presented. An example of multi-eigenvalue optimization problems is also shown to optimize several eigenfrequencies of a simplified model of a car body simultaneously. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940895. (SP- 1028) Gas versus spray injection: which mixes faster? J. Abraham, V. Magi, J. Maclnnes, and F. V. Bracco, Princeton Univ. Results are presented of 3-D computations of direct injection of gaseous methane and of liquid tetradecane through a multi-hole injector into a diesel engine. The study focusses on the distribution of fuel/air ratio within the resulting gas and spray jets under typical diesel conditions prior to ignition. It is shown that for a significant time after start of injection, the fraction of the vapor fuel which is in richer-than-flammable mixtures is greater in gas jets than in sprays. For methane injection, it is also shown that changing some of the flow conditions in the engine or going to a poppet-type injec- tor, does not result in improved mixing. An explanation of these results is provided also through analysis of the self-similar gas jet and 2-D computations of gas and spray jets into constant pressure gas. A scaling for time and axial distance in the self-similar gas jet also clarifies the results. In all, it is concluded that in general a spray mixes faster than a gas jet indirect- injection Diesel engines. 1 994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940896. (SP- 1028) Reducing NOx in ICE. Otto A. Uyehara, University of Wisconsin. A tutorial write up is first presented to give the behavior of drop- let burning (diesel engines) and natural gas burning engines. By cit- ing literature, it is shown that for each droplet there is a certain amount of NOx generated. The combination of droplet burning (in the prechamber) and with natural gas in the main chamber with a good turbocharger system Danyluk, has shown that NOx can be con- trolled to 1.0 gram per brake-horsepower hour while maintaining high brake thermal efficiency. This author has generalized the infor- mation in the design of PCCI (Prechamber Compression Ignition) engine systems. A design chart is given to size the prechamber. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940897. (SP- 1028) Reducing particulate and NOx emissions by using multiple injections in a heavy; duty D.I. diesel engine. T. c. Tow, D. A. Pierpont, and R. D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin. An experimental study has been completed which evaluated the effectiveness of using double, triple and rate shaped injections to simultaneously reduce particulate and NOx emissions. The experi- ments were done using a single cylinder version of a Caterpillar 3406 heavy duty D.I. diesel engine. The fuel system used was a common rail, electronically controlled injector that allowed flexibil- ity in both the number and duration of injections per cycle. Injection timing was varied for each injection scheme to evaluate the particu- late versus NOx tradeoff and fuel consumption. Tests were done at 1600 rpm using engine load conditions of 25% and 75% of maxi- mum torque. The results indicate that a double injection with a sig- nificantly long delay between injections reduced particulate by as much as a factor of three over a single injection at 75% load with no increase in NOx. Double injections with a smaller dwell gave less improvement in particulate and NOx at 75% load. At 25% load, where ignition delays are long, the effect a small dwell between dou- ble injections was found to reduce the premix burn fraction and NOx. Similar results were obtained using a single injection with a ramped injection rate rise, however at 75% load the particulate levels increased as compared to a fast injection rate rise. Triple injections were also found to be effective if the third injection started significantly after the end of the second injection. At 257c load a triple injection reduced particulate by 507c and NOx by 307c. For the multiple injections strategies investigated in this study, a fast injection rate rise was found to be the most beneficial towards an overall reduction of particulate and NOx. The effectiveness of a late injection in both triple and double injections strategies appears to be that it promotes particulate oxidation later in the cycle and improves mixing. Triple injections gave greater flexibility in con- trolling the heat release rate as compared to single and double injec- tions. This flexibility was required for simultaneous reductions in particulate and NOx at 257c load conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940898.

Special attention has been paid toward the cyclic irregularity of the photo-detector's response to the engine radiation signals obtained from the author's experiment, and a quantitative specifica- tion of that phenomenon has been developed. Statistical distribution of the flame radiation intensity tosses have been examined and the sample size effect on measurement accuracy as well as on result sig- nificance has been discussed. 940899.

Yoshinaka Takeda, Naoya Ishikawa, Masanori Komori, and Kinji Tsujimura, New A.C.E. Institute Co., Ltd. This paper presents the results of engine experiments and spray observations on a VCO nozzle. Two types of VCO nozzles having different hole shapes were investigated. One had a straight step hole (the VCO-S) and the other had a tapered step hole (the VCO-T) Both VCO nozzles could greatly reduce HC emissions in com- parison to a standard nozzle. The VCO-S nozzle could reduce NOx emissions more than the VCO-T nozzle, and its spray penetration was shorter than that of the VCO-T. 940900.

The paper describes an analytical approach that models the vaporization, ignition and combustion of liquid fuel droplets in a heated environment of homogeneously mixed gaseous fuel and air at constant pressure such as taking place in dual fuel engines of the compression ignition type. Results are presented typically for the ignition and combustion of n-heptane droplets initially introduced cold into a heated homogeneous surrounding of methane- air mix- tures.

(SP- 1028) Influence of fuel sulfur content on particu- late emissions of Ford 1.8L Sierra turbo-diesel equipped with flow through catalytic converter. V. D. N. Rao and H. A. Cikánek, Ford Motor Co.; and R. W. Horrocks, Ford Motor Co., Ltd. Effectiveness of flow through catalytic diesel particulate aftertre- atement devices in reducing particulate emissions is investigated on Ford's 1360 kg (3000 lb.) Sierra 1.8L turbo- diesel passenger car. Flow-through monolith type EAO reference catalyst and AC Roch- ester diesel catalyst are evaluated using Phillips's Control No. 2 die- sel fuel, low sulfur (0.05% S) and ultra-low sulfur (0.00 1%S) diesel fuels. Comparisons are made with baseline exhaust emissions for FTP75 and Highway chassis dynamometer test procedures. Effects of catalyst aging of 320, 1610 and 6450 km (200, 1000 and 4000 miles) are examined. Results, based on 6450 km (4000 miles) lim- ited durability show that a ceramic monolith substrate of 400 cells per square inch (cpsi) with AC Rochester catalyst is capable of reducing particulate as well as HC and CO emissions to well below the 1994 Government mandated emission requirements with low (0.05%S) and ultra low (0.001 %S) sulfur fuel. This diesel catalyst is recommended as a serious candidate for 162,000 km (100,000) qualification testing. Use of EGR is also a potential means of achieving reduced NOx emissions.

(SP- 1028) Imaging and spatially resolved two-color temperature measurements through a coherent fiber optic: observation of auxiliary fuel injection effects on combustion in a two-stroke DI diesel. Joseph S. Shakal, Tsukuba Science City; and Jay K. Martin, University of Wisconsin. A two-stroke diesel engine was outfitted for operation with an electronic solenoid-controlled unit injector and an additional sole- noid-controlled air-assisted injector at the inlet ports. Access through an existing pressure transducer port allowed installation of a sapphire window to the combustion chamber with very little dis- turbance to the combustion system. A coherent fiber optic bundle permitted remote visualization of the combustion event. Use of a gateable intensified solid-state camera permitted imaging at high effective shutter speeds at arbitrary times in the engine cycle. Imag- ing and two-color temperature and soot concentrations measure- ments were performed. Imaging results indicated a low-intensity diffuse ignition, away from the injector tip, for both the pilot spray in pilot- main tests and the main spray in the main-only runs. Remnants of the burning pilot spray congregated near the injector tip where a region of flame remained until main injection arrived. The main fuel ignited upon injection into this region. Temperature measurements indicated that pilot injection resulted in a region of 2300 K or greater flame temperature around the injec- tor nozzle at the start of main injection. Neither temperatures not soot concentrations were detectable during the two-stage ignition process of the port fuel with this measurement system. Small-scale variations on the order of 100 K were evident in most temperatures images. The soot concentration in the pilot flame did not increase appreciably during the pilot- main delay period. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940904. (SP- 1041) Radar based automotive obstacle detection system. Walter Ulke, Rolf Adomat, and Karlheinz Rutscher, TEMIC GmbH; and Wolfgang Lauer, Daimler Benz AG. This paper highlights the obstacle detection system developed by the Daimler Benz group to assist the driver, particularly in danger- ous traffic situations and in case of bad weather. The area in front of the vehicle is scanned by a radar beam, and the actual traffic is analyzed by signal processing software. Safety distance is calculated and displayed, and a warning is given to the driver whenever necessary. With this information, driving safety and comfort is increased while all actions to be taken still remain under driver control. Cruise control applications can be regarded as a natural system extension. A special chapter is dedicated to vehicle test data evaluation based on a mobile video system operating in the traffic environment and data post-processing in the lab. Effective synergy and a close cooperation of various companies' resources made it possible to push this challenging project rapidly through different development stages to reach the volume pre- production phase in the near future. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940905. (SP- 1041) Chained information systems (an aid to prevent rear-end collisions). Ronald D. Hochnadel and Bryan A. Bey mer, INTRA SS. The societal costs of motor vehicle crashes in the United States exceed $137 billion annually. The death toll from these crashes is near 40,000, and the total injured is near 3 million. Rear-end accidents comprise 23 percent of these crashes. Signifi- cant reductions of rear-end motor vehicle crashes can be realized by providing drivers with useful and timely warnings. The reactions time of drivers responding to dangerous situations averages one-half of a second. When the response to a situation trav- els back through a line of traffic, such as the response when a lead motorist brakes, these half seconds add up significantly. This paper proposes an early warning information system which utilizes linear traffic formations to send brake status through lines of traffic. The brake status information is sent rearward electroni- cally. A chained information system is described which is based upon a linear traffic model in which human reaction time is largely elimi- nated. The result of the application of this system will be a substan- tial reduction in accident costs and a substantial increase in lives saved. 940906.

This review begins with a discussion of the kinds of signals that one expects from an occupant position sensor. Potential noise sources are then examined. The kinds of information that can be extracted from those signals are described. Finally, an example of the application of signal processing techniques to a complex prob- lem is presented. 116</page><page sequence="116">940908-940914 940908.

(SP- 1041) Simulation of BioSID head-neck motions. Devinder S. Grewal, Jacqueline G. Paver, and Tara P. Khatua, Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. Numerous studies have been performed to develop and validate simulation data sets for adult frontal impact dummies; relatively few studies have been conducted for side impact dummies. This paper presents results of a study to develop and evaluate simulation parameters for the BioSID head-neck system. The goal of this study was to review experimental data and develop, validate, and compare simulation parameters for the Bio- SID manikin head-neck system. BioSID is a state-of-the-art biofi- delic side impact dummy recently developed by the Society of Auto- motive Engineers (SAE) for use in side impact tests to assess occu- pant protection. The BioSID head and neck are the same as the head and neck of the Hybrid III frontal crash test dummy. BioSID has been proposed as an alternative to the current side impact dummy, SID, required for side impact tests under Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 571.214. The simulation parameters were derived from the literature and static, quasi-static, and dynamic lateral bending tests performed with BioSID necks. Simulations of the BioSID Head-Neck Pendu- lum (HNP) compliance tests were performed and different energy dissipation algorithms were studied. The simulation results were compared to response data from the HNP tests. It was found that while energy dissipation is required in any algorithm to produce dynamic stability, the choice of energy dissipation algorithm, whether it is viscous damping or differences in loading/unloading curves, does not materially affect the lateral head-neck response in this study. The results of this analysis will be useful in predicting the head and neck response of BioSID in side impacts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940912. (SP- 1030) Damage and/or impact absorber (isolator) movements observed in low speed crash tests involving Ford Escorts. Russell N. Malmsbury, Collision Dynamics and Analysis; and Jerry J. Eubanks, Automobile Collision Cause Analysis. After an accident has occurred, there are a minimal number of low speed crash tests to assist the accident reconstructionist/ engineer in determining the speed of a vehicle from little or no visi- ble vehicle damage. Injuries are being documented by individuals as occurring in relatively low speed collisions. Yet, the impact speeds that have been taught to cause little or no damage do not sug- gest that injuries should have occurred at these correspondingly low G-forces. No comparison of the injury versus vehicle speed will be done in this paper, that is left to the biomechanical engineers and physicians. The purpose of this paper is to examine the issue of low speed impacts and the corresponding damage or shock isolator movement to the vehicle. For the purpose of this paper a low speed collision is an in line impact at a speed below 6 m/s. Most available data from crash testing comes from the Depart- ment of Transportation (D.O.T.) sponsored Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) compliance testing at 13.4 m/s and the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) at 15.6 m/s. In 1993 Kerkh- off et al., enlarged the data base for the 1 98 1 - 1 985 Ford Escort crash test data. Barrier crash test speeds in that paper were conducted at 6.66, 8.88, 17.77 and 22.22 m/s with an unpublished test at 2.22 m/s. Kerkhoff also conducted a car-to- car crash test at 17.9 m/s. To enlarge the data base for real world collisions, the authors conducted a series of 49 crash tests, using 1981-1985 Ford Escorts. Twenty crash tests involved a moving vehicle impacting a stationary vehicle at a speed range of 0.77 and 8.76 m/s. Twenty-nine barrier collisions were conducted at speeds from 0.4 to 4.26 m/s. The test data was reviewed to further examine the issue of the use of repeated crash testing in low speed collisions. 940913. (SP- 1030) A method for determining accident spe- cific crush stiffness coefficients. James A. Neptune and James E. Flynn, J2 Engineering, Inc. The CRASH3 computer program increasingly is being used by engineers as a tool to reconstruct automobile accidents . The damage analysis portion of CRASH3 provides a useful means for quantify- ing the change of velocity, AV, that was experienced by a vehicle during the collision phase of a traffic accident. The degree of useful- ness of the damage analysis portion of the program, however, is dependent upon the availability of valid crush stiffness coefficients. Published crush stiffness coefficients are available for a large number of vehicles. These publications, however, contain only a limited number of coefficients that describe the stiffness characteris- tics of the side structure of vehicles. Engineers are often asked to perform an accident reconstruction when there are neither published stiffness coefficients for the side structure of an involved vehicle or crash test data from which to determine the stiffness. Such a colli- sion usually involves the front end structure of a striking "bullet" vehicle and the side structure of a left turning "target" vehicle. If stiffness coefficients are available for the bullet vehicle, then it may be possible to determine accident-specific stiffness coefficients for the target vehicle. A method is presented in this paper that will allow a determina- tion of accident-specific crush stiffness coefficients for target vehi- cles. The method is based in theory on the CRASH3 damage algo- rithm. Intrinsic to the CRASH3 damage algorithm is Newton's Third Law of Motion that states that the forces of action and reaction between interacting bodies ar equal in magnitude, opposite in direc- tion and collinear. The collision force exerted on the bullet vehicle is calculated based upon its known stiffness characteristics and the magnitude of its residual crush. The collision force exerted on the target vehicle is set equal to the calculated collision force of the bul- let vehicle. Next the damage offset speed, bo, of the target vehicle structure is estimated. An estimation of the damage offset speed is required when mathematically determining the CRASH3 stiffness coefficients, A and B. The estimated damage offset speed is then used, with the calculated collision force, to determine the accident- specific stiffness coefficients of the target vehicle. "Hard spots" such as wheel assemblies can be taken into account during this esti- mation. The stiffness coefficients determined by this method will be based on the complex circumstances of the specific traffic accident. As a result, the stiffness coefficients determined for target vehicles involved in different accidents may not be based on a common and/or constant set of parameters. These stiffness coefficients, there- fore, should be considered valid only for the specific accident. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940914. (SP- 1030) An analysis of trends of vehicle frontal impact stiffness. Michael S. Varat, JFK Engineering; Stein E. Husher, Noble Engineering; and John F. Kerkhoff, JFK Engineer- ing. Impact induced vehicle residual deformation serves as a basis for the reconstruction engineer to make a determination of the energy absorbed during the impact phase of a collision. Many impact phase reconstruction algorithm s assume a liner relation between an absorbed energy function and residual crush in order to derive colli- sion severity (Delta V, BEV, etc.). This is done through the assump- tion of a constant spring stiffness value to describe the vehicle fron- 117</page><page sequence="117">940914-940921 tal impact stiffness. However, some recent rigid barrier impact test data has demonstrated non-linear trends between crash energy and residual crush. The total body of available crash test data indicates that vehicle frontal stiffness cannot be precisely modeled through the use of single linear spring stiffness for all vehicles. This paper will explore stiffness trends and make comparisons to the previously assigned linear assumption for a diverse sample of vehicles and test speeds into frontal fixed barriers. The available crash test data is plotted and analyzed and the resulting linear and non-linear trends are discussed. Applications to the accident reconstruction field are also explored. 940915. (SP- 1030) Delta-V: basic concepts, computational methods, and misunderstandings. Rie D. Robineîîe, Richard J. Fay, and Rex E. Paulsen, Fay Engineering Corp. Vehicle crush deformation and energy equivalence relationships are widely accepted as technical accident reconstruction tools for estimating the change in velocity (Delta-V) during an impact. Delta-V has been accepted as a basis for evaluating damage severity and potential injury severity. Emori, Campbell and McHenry's work led to CRASH derivative type programs which are based upon a relationship between crush magnitude and Delta-V. SMAC deriva- tive type programs utilize these principles while generating a time dependent analysis (simulation) by maintaining a continuous equal- ization of forces between the vehicles during the impact phase. This paper reviews basic principles and the relationships between Delta-V, kinetic energy, conversation of momentum, and barrier equivalent velocity which must be adhered to while performing this type of analysis. Several examples and frequently seen misunder- standings of these relationships are discussed. This paper is intended to assist not only the unseasoned reconstructionist in developing an understanding for Delta-V, but is also intended for the seasoned reconstructionist to assist in demonstrating that their application and interpretation of Delta-V is correct. 940916. (SP- 1030) Characteristics of specific automobile bumpers in low-velocity impacts. Gunter Siegmund, Mark N. Bai- ley, and David J. King, Maclnnis Engineering Associates, Ltd. There are many bumper-to-bumper automobile collisions in which a vehicle occupant claims injury but where there is little or no outward damage to the vehicles. On vehicles equipped with shock- absorber-type bumper isolators, the only "damage" often consists of compression marks left on the isolator piston tube and scuffs on the bumper. This paper examines the behavior of specific automobile bump- ers in aligned low-velocity collisions. Specifically, empirical data gathered during numerous (currently 660) vehicle- to-vehicle and vehicle-to barrier collisions are presented and relationships between isolator compression and vehicle impact severity are developed. General trends among all types of isolators and trends specific to vehicle manufacturers are identified and discussed. Damage thresh- old data are also presented. The effects of additional vehicle mass, braking during the colli- sion, and large differences between the amount of compression on the left and right bumper isolators are explored. Vehicle motions analogous to rear-end impacts are discussed and new data from tests using human volunteers in low-velocity rear- end collisions are pres- ented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940917. (SP- 1030) Querying the NHTSA test database for vehicle performance characteristics. Stephen Werner, Failure Analysis Associates, Inc.; and Peter Carnell, Kent, Vadnais &amp; Wood. Data for 1,745 tests of 1965 through 1992 vehicles are readily available in computerized format in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash test database. The tests are of 2,446 vehicles containing 2,833 occupants and include vehicle into vehi- cle, vehicle into barrier, impactor into vehicle, vehicle into impactor, and several other configurations for production and modified vehi- cles. The test data are divided into four classifications pertaining to test, vehicle, barrier, and occupant parameters. The database format enables study of the performance of a par- ticular vehicle, vehicle class, or vehicle characteristic. The numer- ous comment fields permit rapid identification of special tests, test errors, and vehicle modifications. The ready availability of tests reports from which the database is derived allows clarification of comments and questionable data contained within the database. To investigate the utility of the database, frontal barrier tests at nominal speeds of 30 and 35 mph were collected. Tests that were invalidated due to testing errors or that involved modified vehicles were eliminated from the mix, leaving 223 tests at 30 mph and 364 at 35 mph. These tests included 1978-1992 model year passenger cars, trucks, and vans. Vehicle performance measures including crush, engine and firewall displacement, and initial kinetic energy were examined ver- sus vehicle characteristics such as weight and wheelbase. Occupant performance measures including Head Injury Criterion (HIC), peak 3 ms chest acceleration, and average maximum femur load were compared against vehicle characteristics such as restraint type and occupant compartment geometry. 940918. (SP- 1030) Analysis of accelerometer data for use in skid-stop calculations. Edward L. Robinson, University of Ala- bama. Several accelerometers are now commercially available and are becoming widely used by accident reconstructionists for determin- ing the coefficient of friction or the "drag factor" using an exem- plar vehicle at the accident site. To get a quick estimate of the effec- tive coefficient of friction for the braking test, people often simply average the deceleration values in units of g (gravitational accelera- tion) from the accelerometer output of deceleration versus time. Since this involves an inherent error in method, it is of interest to examine the magnitude of this error. 940919. (SP- 1030) Classifying the elements in a scientific ani- mation. Wesley D. Grimes, Cromack Engineering Associates, Inc. Computer animation and its use in the engineering/scientific community are in their infancy. As this visualization tool becomes more widely used and accepted, individual expectations may differ greatly regarding appropriate usage and documentation of an anima- tion. This paper lays the foundation for establishing guidelines for documenting the data and techniques used in producing an anima- tion. The many elements that make up an animation are discussed, along with their importance to the presentation. The ultimate goal, for using the proposed guideline, is to achieve consistency within the engineering/scientific community when eval- uating an animation. 940920.

The result is that the foundations for scientific testimony have again come under debate, which means that animations will be judged under new criteria.

Anderson, ACE, Inc.; and Erik Carlsson, A.C. Automotive. A formulation for the perfectly plastic deformation of a unitized vehicle body is presented. The method is motivated by insight from a series of tensile tests on vehicle structure samples, both domestic and foreign. Based on the bounding theorems of plasticity, the 118</page><page sequence="118">940921-940929 method is carried out by searching for the minimum rate of work production for a perfectly plastic material in which the elastic com- ponent is ignored.

Day, Engineering Dynamics Corp. This paper describes the use of scientific visualization as a tool for investigating the cause of motor vehicle accidents. A specific accident is reconstructed and simulated. This simulation data is then presented three ways: (1) as a table of numeric results, (2) as a 2-D, graphical simulation viewed from above, and (3) as a fully rendered, 3-D scientific visualization. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are explored, specific data requirements for each method are described, and conformance criteria with preliminary SAE guidelines are reviewed. A distinction between the terms "ani- mation", "simulation", and "scientific visualization" is also pro- vided. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940923. (SP- 1030) An overview of the HVE developer's toolkit. Terry D. Day, Engineering Dynamics Corp. A substantial programming effort is required to develop a human or vehicle dynamics simulator. More than half of this effort is spent designing and programming the user interface (the means by which the user supplies program input and views program output). This paper describes a pre-programmed, 3-dimensional (3-D), input/ output window-type interface which may be used by developers of human and vehicle dynamics programs. By using this interface, the task of input/output programming is reduced by approximately 50 percent, while simultaneously providing a more robust interface. This paper provides a conceptual overview of the interface, as well as specific details for writing human and vehicle dynamics programs which are compatible with the interface. Structures are provided for the human, vehicle and environment models. Structures are also pro- vided for events, interface variables, and the output data stream. By using these standardized structures, any compatible physics model (i.e., human or vehicle dynamics simulator) may be linked into the window interface to model and illustrate, using fully-rendered, 3-D scientific visualization, the kinematic and kinetic behavior of humans and vehicles within their environment. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940924. (SP- 1030) Reconstruction of automobile/pedestrian accidents using CATAPULT. Ralph Aronberg and Andrew A. Snider, Aronberg and Associates. The Combined Airborne Tumbling Analysis Procedure Using Laws of motion to determine Throw speed (CATAPULT) for a pedestrian is compared to the published results of vehicle/pedestrian impact testing. Testing by the authors demonstrating the mechanics and dynamics of an object tumbling to rest following a known tra- jectory is presented. It is shown, that although during ground tum- bling individual impulses of a pedestrian with the ground are what slow the pedestrian, with restitution occurring between these impulses, the use of an average drag factor of 0.5 over the total dis- tance tumbled produces accurate results for initial speed. 940925.

Smith, Collision Safety Engineering, Inc. A controlled experiment involving road marks was conducted to compare various photogrammetry practices currently in use in the accident investigation community. The experimental controls and results are discussed for three variations of one 2-D scheme and for six 3-D photogrammetric schemes applied to a similar set of road marks and points. For measurements related to the most frequent issues in traffic accidents, all of the methods are capable of provid- ing usable data. The experimental photographs and corresponding data represent a reference set for developing skills and for compari- son with other photogrammetry schemes. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940926.

Edward Jobson, Gudmund Smedler, Peter Malmberg, Hans Bernler, and Ove Hjortsberg, Volvo Technological Develop- ment; and Ingemar Gottberg, and Âke Rosen, Volvo Car Corp. The formation of nitrous oxide (N2O) over an aged three way cat- alyst was analyzed in a laboratory reactor for a variety of simulated Otto engine exhaust gas conditions. Nitrous oxide formation was further analyzed during FTP75 dynamometer test with a car. The car was equipped with either an aged catalyst or a fresh one. A fast response diode laser system was modified to enable detection of nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide simultaneously. From laboratory data the kinetics of nitrous oxide formation were evaluated with mathematical simulations and a mechanism was sug- gested. The results were compared to data from vehicle tests and the results were discussed in the light of the laboratory study. Two gen- eral trends were confirmed, i) N20 formation increases at slightly lean conditions, ii) catalysts with a low degree of deterioration gave lower N2O emissions, iii) the extent of N20 formation goes through a maximum with respect to dissociation rate of NO. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940927.

The effect of ignition induced misfire on exhaust catalyst temper- ature has been investigated using an engine bench and a computer model. The effects of misfire rate, exhaust gas flow rate and catalyst condition are reported and conditions that would lead to the melting of a ceramic catalyst are predicted. The modeling techniques have been extended to predict the effect of a fast air to fuel ratio transient on catalyst temperature. Measurements of catalyst temperature during a simulated decelera- tion using fast response thermocouples have shown that a short lived temperature increase does occur. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940928.

Onoda, International Catalyst Technology, Co.; and G. T. Garr and D. Psaras, International Catalyst Technology, Inc. The use of Pd together with Pt/Rh in automotive emission control catalytic converters is discussed. The drawbacks and advantages of Pd are explained for the conversion of CO, HC, and NOx. The per- formance of high loaded Pd-only catalysts is demonstrated in vehi- cle tests according to the FTP75, ECE and Japan- 10-mode proce- dures. It is shown that the advantageous lean HC-light-off tempera- ture observed with high loaded Pd-only catalyst can also be reached with similar loaded Pt-only catalysts. Various alternative ways to incorporate Pd in multi- brick converters are evaluated in vehicle tests. It is shown that single brick three metal converters with high Pd-content can have advantages over conventional Pt/Rh-three way catalysts. However, the extent of the improvement depends strongly upon the particular application, and with the present trend of increasing Pd-prices these three metal converters might lead to increased precious metal costs over conventional Pt/Rh-catalysts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940929.

The effect of adding oxygenates to the fuel, on exhaust emissions and fuel consumption, was evaluated. Chassis dynamometer tests (ECE + EUDC) were carried out on six petrol cars. Three of the cars were fitted with three way catalysts. The fuels had been oxygenated by adding 10% MTBE, 15% MTBE, and 5.2% ethanol. Test results 119</page><page sequence="119">940929-940935 show that oxygenates in the fuel reduce emissions and fuel con- sumption. Of the fuels investigated, addition of 15% MTBE gave most benefits with the following reductions in emissions:- CO: 15 - 30%, NOx: 1.3 - 1.7%, THC: 10 - 20%, C02: 1.0 - 4.0%. Reduc- tions in fuel consumption with 15% MTBE were 1.3 -1.7% for non catalyst cars and 3.2 - 5.2% for catalyst cars. 940930. (SP- 1043) In-use vehicle emissions control in Fin- land: introduction and practical experience. Juhani Laurikko, Technical Research Centre of Finland. Tight certification standards for new motor vehicles have always been the basestock for legislative efforts to control motor vehicle related air pollution. However, new additives need to be used when composing the formula for today's situation, where the relative con- tribution of new vehicles to the overall emissions is quickly dimin- ishing and in-use performance is starting to play an increasingly important role. This paper outlines the general lay-out of the Finnish in-use con- trol program, which was started January 1, 1993. The choice of test procedure as well its initial verification are discussed. Determina- tions and validation of the cut-points are also closely detailed. The main emphasis of the paper, however, lies in the practical experi- ence gathered during the three-year planning and field testing phase that preceded the introduction of the program. Items that are typical for Finland, like cold ambient conditions, are more deeply dis- cussed. Furthermore, some data from the results collected during the first 7 months of the program is presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940931.

A vehicle with a production 1.6 liter 4 valve per cylinder engine that achieved Tier 0 (US87) emission standards, has demonstrated Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) capability. Minimal base engine mod- ifications, the applications of auxiliary air injection and exhaust gas re-circulation (EGR) extended the hardware platform. The systems ultimate potential was achieved by a system specific software and calibration approach. 940932. Improved cell design for increaded catalytic conver- sion efficiency. Wolfgang Held and Manfred Röhls, Volkswagen AG; and Wolfgang Maus, Helmut Swars, Rolf Brück, and Friedrich W. Kaiser, EMITEC GmbH. Compliance with future emission standards in the United States of America and Europe will require modifications to increase the effectiveness of catalytic converters. A significant factor in this respect is not only the conversion in the cold start phase, but also improvement of conversion at vehicle operating temperatures. For example, in order to achieve ULEV values in compliance with Cali- fornian emission standards at an assumed raw engine out emission of 2.0 HC g/m, a conversion rate of 98% in the overall testing is imperative. Parallel to reduced emissions legislation will also require a lower specific fuel consumption. The loss of engine power from increased exhaust gas back pressure in addition to larger space requriements for a catalytic converter in the engine compartment resulting from such measures are of critical importance. With the aid of a special method of structuring the channels, the so-called transversal structure (TS), it is possible to increase the effectiveness of the catalyst by increasing the transverse flow of the gas in the channels. The paper will demonstrate that by reducing the cell density, the increased pressure resulting from the TS design can be compensated for or even overcompensated by a simultaneous increase in effectiveness. The reduced heat capacity of the matrix structure demonstrated in this variant improves the light-off behaviour of the catalytic converter. The TS design also presents the possibility of reducing the catalyst volume for applications with restricted space allowances whilst retaining identical effectiveness. 940933. (SP- 1043) Emissions performance of current TWC vehicles at low ambient temperature over FTP and ECE test cycles. Juhani Laurikko, Technical Research Centre of Finland. The widening use of three-way catalyst for emission control has brought an increasing number of vehicles employing this technol- ogy also to the areas of cold climate, like the Nordic countries. How- ever, cold operating environment is found to derate the performance of a TWC system, as the guidelines for its design are mainly set by the legislation, in which the test procedures have not taken into account low ambient conditions. This set is about to change, as the United States has recently introduced a low temperature emissions test with CO standard. Similar evolution has also already begun in Europe. This paper addresses the emissions performance of current tech- nology TWC vehicles at low ambient temperature conditions. Both the U.S.FTP75 as well as the Eurotest now comprising the ECE15 and the EUDC driving schedules has been used to assess the response of emission control system. Three fleets of cars, altogether 24 vehicles have been tested. Apart from the legislative emissions, some unregulated emissions have also been studied. 940934. (SP- 1043) Transient modeling of 3-way catalytic con- verters. K. N. Pattas, A. M. Stamatelos, P. K. Pistikopoulos, G. C. Koltsakis, and P. A. Konstandinidis, Aristotle University Thessalo- niki; and E. Volpi, and E. Leveroni, Fiat Research Center. The modeling of transient phenomena occurring inside an auto- motive 3-way catalytic converter poses a significant challenge to the emissions control engineer. Since the significant progress that has been observed with steady-state models cannot be directly exploited in this direction, it is necessary to develop a fully transient model and computer code incorporating dynamic behavior of the three way catalytic converter in a relatively simple and effective way. The Laboratory of Applied Thermodynamics (LAT), Aristotle Univer- sity Thessaloniki, is cooperating with the Engine Direction of Fiat Research Center, in the development of a computer code fulfilling these objectives, within the framework of an EEC Brite EuRam cost shared project. The CRF and LAT modeling approaches, along with the underlying philosophy and experimental work, are presented in this paper. The model and computer codes developed are currently employed to establish and understand critical behavior trends involved in engine emission control system optimization. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940935. (SP- 1043) Performance and durability of palladium only metallic three- way catalyst. Matti Härkönen, Matti Kivioja, Pekka Lappi, Päivi Mannila, Teuvo Maiinula, and Thomas Slotte, KEMIRA Metalkat Oy. The paper introduces a new catalytic formulation to improve the performance of 3-way catalyst. This new palladium-only catalyst concept (K4) was designed specifically for low temperature light-off and high temperature applications. The catalysts employed in this study were prepared on metallic substrates of nominal cell density of 78 cells/cm2 (cpscm). To assess the effect of the cell density on the performance, the cell densities of 47 - 186 cpscm were also used. The catalysts were evaluated after the engine dynamometer aging and the on-road aging for 80,000 km. Several physical and chemical methods were used to analyze the washcoat layer. The elements and distribution of the poisons in the catalyst were analyzed. The cata- lytic activities of both fresh and aged samples were measured also in laboratory tests. Pd-only K4 three-way washcoat technology is proved to exhibit superior hydrocarbon conversion compared to the usual Pt-Rh cata- lysts in extensive dynamometer and vehicle aging studies. Only the NOx efficiency was lower than that of Pt-RH 3-way converters. The performance of the K4 catalyst can further be optimized by calibrat- ing the lambda-control system exactly for this washcoat chemistry. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 120</page><page sequence="120">940936-940943 940936. (SP- 1043) Multiple disc catalytic converters - An innovative approach for improved conversion at lower cost. H. Bressler , H. Weltens, and F. Terres, Heinrich Gillet GmbH &amp; Co. KG. The ' 'Multiple Disc Converter" is an innovative concept. In comparison to conventional catalytic converters, it is significantly less expensive and more compact, at identical conversion efficiency and durability. The catalytic substrate consists of 4 to 5 cylindrical ceramic discs with 62 cells/cm2 (400 cells/inch2). These are assem- bled in a sheet metal casing, without gaps between the discs, and angularly offset to each other. The flow through the channels is interrupted at the contact surfaces of the individual discs. Hence, the restarted turbulent flow intensifies the transverse mass transfer. Fur- ther, the uniformity of the exhaust gas flow is improved, particularly in the first discs. Thus, the conversion of emissions is improved and the durability extended. When the conversion is maintained at the level of conventional converters, then the converter volume can be substantially reduced using the same specific catalyst loading. This is attained by a 10 to 15% shortening of the total length. The econo- mizing of precious metals, manufacturing savings from the more compact casing and the simplified canning system, all result in up to 10% lower costs. The basic applicability for large scale produc- tion has been proved. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940937. (SP- 1021) Springback prediction in sheet forming simulation. Changqing Du, Li Zhang, and Neng-Ming Wang, Chrysler Corp. Although numerical simulation techniques for sheet metal form- ing become increasingly maturing in recent years, prediction of springback remains a topic of current investigation. The main point of this paper is to illustrate the effectiveness of a modeling approach where static implicit schemes are used for the prediction of spring- back regardless whether a static implicit or dynamic explicit scheme is used in the forming simulation. The approach is demonstrated by revisiting the 2-D draw bending of NUMISHEET'93 and numerical results on two real world stampings. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940938.

(SP- 1021) Investigation of shrink flanging - Prediction of wrinkling and experimental verification. Chuan-Tao Wang, General Motors Corp.; and Serdar Tufekci, Gary L. Kinzel, and Taylan Altan, Ohio State Univ. Shrink flanging is a major sheet forming operation to produce convex flanges in structural sheet metal components. Flanges are used for appearance, rigidity, hidden joints, and strengthening of the edge of sheet parts such as automobile front fender and complex panels formed by stretch/draw forming. Wrinkling around the flange edge is the major defect in shrink flanging operation. There has been a lack of reliable mathematical modeling to predict the strains and wrinkles in shrink flanging operations. A trial-and-error approach has been usually practiced in tooling and process designs. In this paper, a wrinkling criterion in shrink flange is proposed based on a simplification from a general criterion for a doubly curved aniso- tropic shell. The mathematical model for strain analysis in shrink flanging is established based on Wang and Wenner's strain model for stretch flange. Shrink flanging experiments were conducted to validate the theories. The mathematical models and failure criteria can be used in practice as design aids and as guidelines for a fast analysis of shrink flanging operations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940940. (SP- 1021) On the role of binder shape for metal stampings. Terry Walker and Medhat Karima, Forming Technolo- gies Incorporated. The effect of binder shape on the formability of metal stampings is addressed in this work. The paper starts with a discussion of a binder development approach for developable or near developable binders. An FEM based test for closeness to developable surfaces is also presented. In this case, the binder surface is meshed using standard FEM discretization techniques. The test is used as an evaluator for the proneness of wrinkle formation at the binder clos- ing stage under the binder surface. The formability of a door outer panel is evaluated and the form- ing severity related to binder shape. It is shown that addendum and binder designs are key process variables that have to be designed up front and related to product characteristics. 940941. (SP- 1021) Estimation and control of drawbead forces in sheet metal forming. Serdar S . Tufekci, Chuan-Tao Wang, Gary L. Kinzel, and Taylan Altan, Ohio State Univ. In sheet metal forming, drawbeads are often used to control uneven material flow which may cause defects such as wrinkles, fractures, surface distortion and springback. Appropriate setting and adjusting the drawbead force is one of the most important parame- ters in sheet forming process control. However, drawbead design and drawbead force adjustment still rely on trial-and-error proce- dures. This paper summarizes the guidelines in drawbead design, evaluates a number of mathematical models in estimating drawbead forces, and investigates the effects of sheet thickness, material prop- erties, drawbead geometry and penetration on the drawbead force. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940942.

The sheet metal response to clamping was experimentally simu- lated using a special purpose, friction testing device. Draw Bead Simulation and rectangular geometry tests were used. The sheet response for electrogalvanized (EG) sheet steel was determined at a fast (200 in/min) and a slow (1 in/min) testing speeds. EG coated sheets showed significant sticking to the tooling, this effect was especially high when testing at slow speeds. The technique was then used to compare two EG coated to the same sheet substrate. Those coatings were reported to differ in their press performance. The experimental results substantiated that difference. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940943. (SP- 1021) Development of high strength steel sheet with excellent stretch-flange formability for automobile applica- tion. Hirohide Asano, Nobuhiko Matsuzu, Atsushi Itami, and Kazuo Koyama, Nippon Steel Corp. With the aim of improving stretch-flange formability by further reducing carbides in steel, the authors studied the hole expansion ratio of a steel consisting entirely of ferrite and the factors governing the hole expansion ratio. Ultra low carbon steels adding Ti and/or Nb showed a higher hole expansion ratio than conventional steels, but their hole expan- sion ratio was not higher than the hole expansion ratio of bainitic steel reported before. On the other hand, it was found from study of the relationship between hole expansion ratio and r- value of vari- ous steels, including cold-rolled interstitial- free steels, that the hole expansion ratio of a steel consisting only of the ferrite phase is strongely influenced by the minimum r-value and n-value and that it improves as the r- and n-values increase. The steel added Ti and/or Nb has a strong anisotropy of r-value, hence its minimum r-value is small. This is disadvantageous to hole expansion ratio. 121</page><page sequence="121">940943-940951 In order to reduce the anisotropy of r-value (improve the mini- mum r-value by controlling the texture), it is effective without Ti and/or Nb. By the method, the stretch-flange formability could be improved and a hole expansion ratio of 2.3 to 2.4, higher than that of the bainitic steels, could be obtained with the strength of 370 to 590 MPa. It is considered that the addition of Ti and/or Nb widens the unrecrystallized region of y and the randomization of y texture, thereby increasing the anisotropy of r-value (decreasing the mini- mum r-value). 940944.

Recently, as one of the effective measures for engine noise reduction, vibration damping steel sheets (VDSS) have been increasingly applied to engine oil sumps. This paper describes the formability of VDSS. Various factors closely related to drawability are considered. This study has been carried out in a production engi- neering process of manufacturing exceedingly deep, single blank sheet, oil sump for heavy-duty truck diesel engines. Some treatment of the surface of the VDSS was found to be a principal factor influ- encing deep drawability. 940945. (SP- 1021) Sheet steel surface treatments for enhanced formability. K. S. Raghavan, T. J. Garrett, Jr., and J. G. Speer, Bethlehem Steel Corp. Surface friction is an important characteristic which influences the formability of sheet steel products. Numerous friction tests have been developed, and many previous investigations have reported effects of surface characteristics, coatings, lubrication, etc., on for- mability. Recently, increased attention has been focussed on reduc- ing friction via the application of solid film lubricants or special sur- face post-treatments such as phosphates, metallics/intermetallics, etc. This paper presents the results of selected laboratory evaluations conducted using a variety of steels and surface treatments. Forma- bility was measured using Limiting Dome Height and Drawbead Simulator friction testing, along with Limiting Draw Ratio testing in one instance. The examples highlight some potential opportuni- ties which may be considered for improving formability in industrial stamping operations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940946. Low heat rejection regenerated engines - a superior alternative to turbocompounding. Allan J. Ferrenberg, ReJen Co. This paper describes a new form of reciprocating engine and the work accomplished to date to investigate the capabilities and feasi- bility of this engine. This engine offers the substantial performance advantages that are thermodynamically possible when regeneration is applied to a low heat rejection (LHR) engine. Under a contract with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, a com- puter model that is capable of modeling the complex processes occurring in the LHR regenerated engine has been constructed. This model is being used to assess and examine the performance of vari- ous engine designs. In addition, design and materials issues associ- ated with the most critical new component, the regenerator, are being investigated. Throughout this program, Caterpillar, Inc. has provided valuable technical support. 940948. Effect of elevated piston temperature on combustion chamber deposit growth. Donald J. Nakic, Dennis N. Assanis, and Robert A. White, U niverrsity of Illinois. An experimental study was conducted to investigate the effects on elevated piston temperature on deposit growth patterns in a spark-ignition (SI) engine. A series of thermocouple- instrumented, insulated piston designs were developed for controlling and in-situ monitoring of deposit growth on the the piston surface. Upon stabili- zation of deposit growth, a physical and chemical analysis of depos- its from different locations was conducted. It was shown that local- ized deposit growth correlated strongly with rates of change of tem- perature at the same locations. At the end of an accelerated 18-hour test schedule using a premium unleaded fuel without reformer bot- toms, a 4 ļim reduction in average deposit thickness was achieved by elevating the piston surface temperature from 215°C to 264°C. No measurable deposit growth was obtained when operating with a critical wall surface temperature of 320°C and the base unleaded fuel. However, addition of reformer bottoms to the base unleaded fuel altered deposit properties and growth patterns. Elevating wall temperature was also shown to increase the carbon- to-hydrogen ratio in the composition of deposits. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940949. An observation of high temperature combustion phe- nomenon in low-heat-rejection diesel engines. Yiming Wang, Changlin Yang, Guocai Shit, Yincheng Jit, and Kuihan Zhao, Tianjin U niw Experimental research was carried out by a high speed camera to observe the effects of the ambient temperature, the pressure and the parameters of injection nozzle on spray development, the igni- tion delay, the location of ignition, the flame propagation and the combustion rate in a constant-volume bomb which simulates the high temperature and pressure condition of Low Heat Rejection (LHR) engines. The experimental results show that at high tempera- ture the ignition delay becomes very short and the ignition occurs near the nozzle tip. The decreased premixed combustion can't pro- vide enough energy for subsequent air fuel mixing. The spray is enveloped totally by the flame that prevents the air entrainment to the spray. Therefore the combustion duration is prolonged at high temperature compared with low temperature. Reducing the nozzle orifice diameter and employing the special type of impingement plate can accelerate air fuel mixing and therefore, reduce the com- bustion duration at high temperature. 940950. An investigation of the effects of node density on finite element thermal/stress analysis as applied to low heat rejection diesel heads. Eugene Danielson, David Gonska, and Wal- ter Bryzik, U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. In our prior analytical work concerning a finite element method- ology for thermal stress analysis of minimum cooled low heat rejec- tion (LHR) engine cylinder heads, a very fine mesh with strict aspect ratio and element density criteria was used. In this current study, these criteria were relaxed and two other finite element models with different element densities were used to solve the same thermal stress problem. The thermal and stress results of the relaxed models are compared to those of the earlier very fine mesh results. It is the aim of this paper to show in a semi-quantified manner, how mesh density can affect thermal stress solutions in LHR engine heads. Hopefully this will enable other analysts working in this area to make some judgement on mesh density before starting an actual modeling effort, resulting in a savings of time and manpower resources. 19 94 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940951. 100 hour endurance testing of a high output adia- batic diesel engine. Melvin E. Woods, Adiabatics, Inc.; and Walter Bryzik and Ernest Schwarz, U.S. Army TACOM. An advanced low heat rejection engine concept has successfully completed a 100 hour endurance test. The combustion chamber components were insulated with thermal barrier coatings. The engine components included a titanium piston, titanium headface plate, titanium cylinder liner insert, M2 steel valve guides and monolithic zirconia valve seat inserts. The tribological system was composed of a ceramic chrome oxide coated cylinder liner, chrome carbide coated piston rings and an advanced polyolester class lubri- cant. The top piston compression ring included a novel design fea- ture to provide self-cleaning of ring groove lubricant deposits to pre- vent ring face scuffing. The prototype test engine demonstrated 52 percent reduction in radiator heat rejection with reduced intake air aftercooling and strategic forced oil cooling. 122</page><page sequence="122">940953-940964 940953. The role of engineering thermoplastics in automotive fuel systems. Michael E. Cathey, LNP Engineering Plastics Inc. With ever-improving technologies employed in automotive fuel injection systems, many new materials, specifically high perfor- mance engineering thermoplastics, are being utilized by automotive part manufacturers. This paper will focus on several key require- ments of the automotive fuel system and will detail a variety of ther- moplastic compounds which are being used to address these needs. The intent of the paper is to present material technology which addresses key issues facing the automotive industry in designing fuel delivery systems. With ever increasing governmental, environmental and con- sumer demands such as corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE), emission/permeability, and extended warranty respectively, auto- motive OEM's and Tier 1 suppliers are changing the fuel system requirements and materials. No longer is metal tubing and rubber hose capable or acceptable in every circumstance. As these changes occur, new issues like static generation, perme- ability and dimensional control exist. Dealing with these is critical to the wide spread use of thermoplastic materials to these applica- tions. 940956. Performance of fluorocarbon elastomers in MTBE/ fuel blends. Salvatore Aloisio, Ausimont USA, Inc. The drive to reduce automobile emissions has lead to the use of so called "reformulated gasoline". MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether) is an oxygenate and a typical component of these fuels. Fluo- rocarbon elastomers are high performance materials commonly used to produce a variety of fuel system components (fuel hoses, O-rings, diaphragms, etc.) This paper will study the effect of MTBE/fuel blends on fluorocarbon elastomers by using a designed experiment. We will systematically and simultaneously evaluate the effects of varying the MTBE level, temperature and fluorine content using a full factorial design scheme. The paper will provide end-users with information regarding the effect of MTBE/fuel blends on fluorocarbon elastomers under vari- ous conditions and it will also provide an example of the practical use of designed experiments. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 940957. Elastomeric sealing materials for transmission flu- ids. Leonard D. Barnes, Goshen Rubber Company, Inc. Automatic Transmission Fluids (ATFs) are being changed due to the more severe operating conditions and the need for a "life of the car" fluid. These changes in the ATFs can have a very negative effect on some traditional elastomeric materials and leave others unaffected. 940958. Polyacrylate elastomers in engine gasket applica- tions. Paul E. Manley, Mark S. Peachey, and John Stothard, Zeon Chemicals USA, Inc. Temperatures in the engine compartments of modern automotive models has been increasing over recent years. This has placed a greater reliance on the ability of elastomer components to seal the engine. In this paper the basic chemistry of polyacrylates elastomers is discussed as well as their market share in engine gasket applications. This study also compares a number of elastomers against the rele- vant parameters identified as needed for successful engine gasket sealing. These include heat and oil resistance, as well as compres- sive stress relaxation. 940959. Stress relaxation of etbylene/acrylic and other gasket materials in automotive fluids. Denise A. Kotz and Theresa M. Dobel, E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company, Inc. Compression stress relaxation is becoming an increasingly useful tool to determine how well a sealing material will perform in various environments. While stress relaxation data has been published on some rubber materials, there is very little recent data for ethylene/ acrylic elastomer, even though it is one viable option for engine and transmission gasket applications. In addition, three new grades of ethylene/acrylic elastomer have been recently commercialized, all of which make very suitable gasket materials. This makes it very timely to investigate the performance of this family of sealing mate- rials. The purpose of this paper is to measure compression stress relax- ation for these new grades of ethylene/acrylic in both SG engine oil and automatic transmission fluid for extended periods of time. The results of the ethylene/acrylic grades will also be compared to those of functionally competitive materials, such as polyacrylate and sili- cone. 940962. (SP- 1014) Fast NO measuring device for internal combustion engines. Stephan Baltisberger and Karl Ruhm, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. A fast, versatile nitric oxide (NO) measuring device applying the principles of chemiluminescence has been developed. This device consists of a small sensor head attachable to the engine exhaust sys- tem and a mobile cart containing all the necessary auxiliary aggre- gates and the signal processing unit. Optimization techniques based on a physico-chemical model and strict miniaturization were applied in the development of this NO measuring device. Subsequent tests utilizing a solenoid valve and bottled calibration gas confirmed the predicted dynamic behavior of the instrument. This device now shows an extremely short sampling delay and a higher bandwidth than common NO measuring devices can offer. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940963. (SP- 1014) Time-resolved measurement of speciated hydrocarbon emissions during cold start of a spark-ignited engine. Edward W. Kaiser, Walter O. Siegl, Lanise M. Baidas, Ger- ald P. Lawson, Carl F. Cramer, Kelvin L. Dobbins, Paul W. Roth, and Michael Smokovitz, Ford Motor Co. Speciated HC emissions from the exhaust system of a production engine without an active catalyst have been obtained wit 3 sec time resolution during a 70°F cold start using two control strategies. For the conventional cold start, the emissions were initially enriched in light fuel alkanes and depleted in heavy aromatic species. The light alkanes fell rapidly while the lower vapor pressure aromatics increased over a period of 50 sec. These results indicate early reten- tion of low vapor pressure fuel components in the intake manifold and exhaust system. Loss of higher molecular weight HC species does occur in the exhaust system as shown by experiments in which the exhaust system was preheated to 100°C. The atmospheric reac- tivity of the exhaust HC emissions for photochemical smog forma- tion increases as the engine warms. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940964. (SP- 101 4) Computer controlled sampling and inlet system for time- resolved, engine-synchronous exhaust gas anal- ysis. Hugo Betzold, Berno Spiegelhalder, and Roland Veigel, Dor- nier GmbH. The increased pollution of the air by engine vehicles has led most highly industrialized countries to reduce the limits on the emission of pollutants by combustion engines. In order to evaluate the various measures for the reduction of pollutants, exhaust gas analysis sys- tems with ever increasing performance are required. The Sampling and Inlet System (SIS) presented here can resolve up to 100 gas samples per second with regard to time and make available associ- ated with crankshaft angles to within 2mD. In conjunction with a fast mass analyzer, the contents of exhaust gas can be determined in real time and on-line or with the use of an exhaust gas collection device, analyzed off-line without loss of time resolution. The system thereby makes an essential contribution to the expansion of dynamic exhaust gas analysis. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 123</page><page sequence="123">940965-940977 940965. (SP- 1014) A universal interface for the integration of emissions testing equipment into engine testing automation sys- tems: the VDA-AK SAMT-Interface. Kurt Joqun, Mercedes-Benz AG. The AK-SAMT-Interface is a simple, standardized communica- tions interface for the integration of emissions testing equipment into emissions testing automation systems.

Some problems of the interface are discussed. 940966. (SP- 1014) Progress in CVS techniques - A variable flow CVS. Wolfgang Thiel, BMW ; and Hans-Joachim Decker and Sylvain Van Damme, Siemens. Although conventional CVS (Constant Volume Sampling) equipment is well established, future requirements for measuring the emitted concentrations of regulated components from ULEV (Ultra Low Emission Vehicles) cars will require optimized dilution ratios. By means of a needle driven by a stepper motor the variable CFV (Critical Flow Venture)-CVS will be able to adjust the CVS main- taining critical conditions to a predefined volume in less than one second. Using this new design and operating it with software- controlled predefined volume modes, it will be possible to optimize dilution ratios by at least a factor of three. In this case ULEV measurements could be performed by using conventional analyzers. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940970. (SP- 1014) Constant volume sampling system water condensation. Frank Black, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and Richard Snow, ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc. Combustion of organic motor vehicle fuels produces carbon dioxide and water (h:0) vapor (and also products of incomplete combustion, e.g. hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, at lower con- centrations). The Constant Volume Sampling (CVS) system, com- monly used to condition auto exhaust for sampling and analysis, provides for controlled ambient air dilution of the engine exhaust. Water condensation can be a problem during CVS system sample conditioning, depending upon vehicle fuel composition and fuel economy, and diluent air humidity and exhaust/diluent ratio. This paper describes a "spreadsheet" procedure for detailed, second by second, determination of diluted exhaust dew point and the neces- sary CVS system flow rates to avoid H2O vapor condensation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 940972. Model-based air-fuel ratio control in SI engines with a switch-type EGO sensor. Alois Amstutz, Nicholas P. Fekete, and J. David Powell, Stanford Univ. High bandwidth control of the air-fuel ratio is necessary in order to minimize the exhaust emissions of spark-ignition engines with three-way catalytic converters. A new approach is to implement a control structure based on modern control and estimation theory. This work describes the implementation of an estimator-based con- troller which uses the feedback from an on-off zirconia exhaust oxy- gen sensor of the type currently used in production vehicles. The limit-cycle associated with the on-off oxygen sensor in conventional systems is eliminated with the estimator-based control structure. Furthermore, the in-cylinder air-fuel ratio tracks the commanded value, so that if a limit cycle is desired in some areas of the engine's operating range for better catalyst operation, its amplitude and fre- quency can be set arbitrarily. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940973. Predictive engine spark timing control. Dah-Lain Tank, Man-Feng Chang, and Myrna C. Sultan, General Motors Corp. In this paper, new event-based engine control algorithms utiliz- ing more than one reference pulse per cylinder firing event are designed for improved engine spark timing control. These control algorithms, based on the cyclic nature of the internal combustion engines, can achieve more accurate estimation of crankshaft rota- tional speed and position than conventional algorithms. The applica- tion of these prediction algorithms to improve the accuracy of engine spark timing control is demonstrated using a dynamic engine simulation. 940974. Advanced nonlinear engine idle speed control sys- tems. Lars Kjergaard, Steffen Nielsen, Thomas Vesterholm, and Elbert Hendricks, Technical University of Denmark. One of the most important operating modes for SI engines is in the idle speed region. This is because SI engines spend a large part of their time operating in this mode. Moreover, a large measure of operator satisfaction is dependent on an engine operating smoothly and reliably in and around idle. In particular the operator expects that the idle speed will remain constant in spite of the engine loads due to power steering pumps and air conditioning compressors. In the idle speed region an SI engine is thought to be quite non- linear because the engine loading can be quite significant, thus forc- ing the engine to be driven through a reasonably large portion of its lower operating range. Many of the earlier studies of idle speed con- trol systems have dealt with linearized models which in principle have limited validity for the problem at hand. In order to improve this situation, it is necessary to deal with the more general nonlinear control problem. In this paper two nonlinear control strategies are compared with conventional PID and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LGR) regulator designs. The nonlinear controllers studied are of the Input-Output Linearization and Sliding Mode types and the design methodology is detailed in the paper. All of the regulators designed have been realized and tested on an experimental engine equipped with micro- processor driven, electronic throttle control. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940975. Road tests of a misfire detection system. William B. Ribbens and Jaehong Park, University of Michigan. This paper presents the theory and experimental performance of a system for detecting engine misfires in automobiles. The method is potentially suitable for meeting the California Air Resources Board (CARB) requirements under On Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) rules. The instrumentation for the present method measures (noncon- tacting) crankshaft instantaneous angular speed. Highly efficient signal processing algorithms permit detection of each individual misfire. The performance of the present method is expressed in terms of error rates made in detecting individual misfires. Normal operating conditions yield error rates under 10"4. Under worst case conditions consisting of light load, high RPM and rough roads with the torque converter in lockup are under 10" 3. 940977. The evaluation of a compute controlled air pump for improved automobile emissions. Lori M. Snook and Jeffrey W. Hodgson, University of Tennessee. Proof-of-concept testing was performed to determine the effec- tiveness of a computer controlled air pump (CCAP) in reducing the unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emitted from automobile engines. For the initial phase of testing, prototype CCAP was designed and evaluated on a dynamometer test-stand at the University of Tennessee. This CCAP maintained the engine's exhaust at a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio by utilizing a second oxy- gen sensor mounted downstream from the catalyst. In this way, the catalyst's conversion efficiency for CO and UHC was always high, even if the engine was running rich. Results of this steady-state test- ing indicated that the CCAP was able to reduce UHC and CO emis- sions without a corresponding increase in oxide of nitrogen (NOx) emissions. Additionally, catalyst temperatures did not increase dra- matically. 124</page><page sequence="124">940977-940984 For the second phase of testing, the CCAP was installed on a vehicle and four sets of emission tests were performed at the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency's Environmental Research Center Annex in Research Triangle Park, NC. As a result of testing, it was determined that the CCAP has merit as a system to decrease CO and UHC emissions during acceleration and power enrichment. How- ever, the CCAP must be activated after the catalyst has lit- off (or it can delay catalyst light-off and result in poor emissions). NOx emissions remained essentially unchanged and catalyst temperatures did not increase by more than 1 10°C. Recommendations for further study are made. 940978. The estimation of ambiguous change in 4WS control system using failure detection filter. Hiroyuki Yamaguchi, Masataka Osawa, and Norio Iwama, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc.; and Masaki Yamamoto, Toyota Motor Corp. This paper presents a new method for estimating the ambiguous change in a 4WS control system using a failure detection filter. This filter is designed to discriminate ambiguous failure modes in the control system by processing output errors between sensors and an observer. The result of the experiments using a 4WS vehicle revealed that the filter can estimate the failures of the sensors and the actuator with high accuracy. The effects of a lateral wind and other disturbances on the filter were also clarified. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940979. Designing for optimum damageability, repairability and insurability - How repair costs relate to insurance costs. Jack A. Ribbens, Tech-Cor, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to discuss vehicle damageability, repairability and insurability, to show the inter-dependence of these terms and how they should be considered in the new vehicle design/ development process. The paper can be used as a companion to SAE J 1 555-RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR OPTIMIZING AUTO- MOBILE DAMAGEABILITY. J 1555 provides information on how to improve damageability. This paper explains why improving dam- ageability and repairability are important for containing insurance costs. A brief description of automobile insurance terminology and coverage is given, so as to prepare the engineer for the design phi- losophy examples that show how improvements in damageability and repairability can be achieved. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 940980. Use of computerized mold filling analysis to optimize part dimensional accuracy, susan E. Blackson, Arco Chemical. In recent years, the compression of vehicle development cycles in the automotive industry has driven the usage of computer aided engineering analysis methods which provides vital information on product performance during the design phase. Computer aided engi- neering simulations of the structural response of an air bag deploy- ment, the thermal response of sun load exposure, as well as the material response of the manufacturing method provide the required feedback to the platform development team in a timely manner. A specific method of computer aided engineering which has experienced innovative growth and development is the manufactur- ing process analysis. In an effort to provide cost and schedule effec- tive solutions for the manufacturing development of a molded part, injection molding process simulation has evolved into new levels of functionality and complexity. Historically, injection moldign pro- cess simulation was restricted to providing material balance within the cavity. Recently, however, methods of computer aided process simulation are employed to ascertain the optimal part design, tool design, and process profile which will ensure the quality of the injection molded part. The goal of this paper is to explore the complex groups of param- eters employed in an injection molding process simulation and thereby understand the impact of these parameters on the analytical solution. Moreover, computer aided engineering analysis methods are only useful and productive when the simulation replicates the actual physical phenomenon. With this focus on the correlation of the analytical simulation of the injection molding process to the actual tool performance, the parameters which shall be reviewed include material characterization methods and data generation, part and tool design details, and the facility definition. 940981. Environmental cubing fixture (ECF) - A develop- ment tool for automotive interiors and exteriors to increase quality and reduce timing and cost. Richard W. Mozer, Delta Tooling Co. Modern automotive quality control has been made possible by the recent advances in computer controlled product design, CAD/ CAM surface data generation, and CNC master model/tooling cuts. Parallel to that new technology emerging, "space-age" materials have resulted in a new type of tool which guarantee absolute adher- ence to design intent surface quality. These new quality control tools, environmental cubing fixtures, are made available early in the car development cycle and have resulted both in time savings of up to six months during the development process, and in cost savings of tens of millions of dollars per individual model design, through the elimination of many engineering changes. 940982. Intervehicular Information System (IVIS): the basis for a tactical information system. R. Gary Diaz, General Dynam- ics. The Intervehicular Information System (IVIS) is a computer driven communications network embedded in the vehicle electron- ics of the Ml A2 main battle tank now entering international service. The system uses multifunction controls and displays to provide a graphics user interface for human-machine interaction, embedded sensors for the information integration, a distributed multiprocessor computer system for information processing, and a digital commu- nications channel. While the Intervehicular Information System offers many features and benefits to the operators that are using it, its primary interest to commanders is its capability to integrate com- bined arms operations in a rapidly moving situation and support essential graphic and digital information requirements for mission accomplishments to provide the basis for automating mobile com- bined arms force integration. IVIS supports this by networking mobile information systems which provide a battle command capa- bility. A discussion of IVIS and other emerging information system capabilities provides insights into the challenges of integrating information systems with mobility technologies as is required in the Intelligent Vehicle Highway System. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 940983. Traction motors and power electronics for advanced electric drive systems. Ronald A. Gellatly and Pasquale Rezza, Jr., Kaman Electromagnetics Corp.; and Ghasan Khalil, TARDEC. Electric drive is finding applications in many new land-based systems, ranging from heavy armored vehicles to public transporta- tion buses and automobiles. The development of these electric drive systems has been made possible, largely due to significant advances in the design of motors, generators and power electronics. While these advances have allowed designers to proceed with the develop- ment of operational vehicles, further developments are now being considered for application to future land vehicle concepts, beyond the scope of present programs. The present paper discusses the issues associated with the development of new types of motors that are appropriate for the particular requirements of land vehicle trac- tion. The paper also discusses new concepts for advanced solid-state power electronics, which will be required for future electric drive vehicles. 940984. Regenerative active suspension on rough terrain vehicles. Glenn R. Wendel, Joe Steiber, and Gary L. Stecklein, Southwest Research Institute. Progress on the development of active suspension for improving mobility of rough terrain vehicles is being hindered by the poten- tially high energy requirements. A unique regenerative active sus- 125</page><page sequence="125">940984-940991 pension system has been conceived and is being developed to pro- vide active suspension with very low energy requirements. Regener- ative active suspension consists of multiple variable displacement pumps, each controlling flow to and from hydro-pneumatic struts to control a vehicle's low frequency body motions. When fluid is returned from a strut to a pump, energy is recovered or "regener- ated" so that the total energy requirement is very low. This paper presents the results of a study showing the potential of the regenera- tive active suspension system to improve vehicle control and ride comfort of rough terrain vehicles enhancing mobility while requir- ing very little additional energy. Simulation results are presented for both tracked and wheeled vehicles, comparing regenerative active suspension to passive suspension and other forms of active suspen- sion. The design of a compact, efficient, multiple pump unit will also be presented which makes it possible to incorporate this system in rough terrain vehicles. Results of pump simulation and pump test- ing will be presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 940986. Optimization of in-cylinder flow and mixing for a center-spark four-valve engine employing the concept of barrel- stratification. K. Kuwahara, T. Walanabe , J. Takemura, S. Omori, T. Kume, and H. Ando , Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Flow and flame structure visualization and modeling were per- formed to clarify the characteristics of bulk flow, turbulence and mixing in a four-valve engine to adopt the lean combustion concept named "Barrel-Stratification" to the larger displacement center- spark four-valve engine. It was found that the partitions provided in the intake port and the tumble-control piston with a curved-top con- figuration were effective to enhance the lean combustion of such an engine. By these methods, the fuel distribution in the intake port and the in-cylinder bulk flow structure are optimized, so that the rela- tively rich mixture zone is arrange around the spark plug. The tum- ble-control piston also contributes to optimize the flow field struc- ture after the distortion of tumble and to enable stable lean combus- tion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940987. Cyclic variability in spark ignition engines - A litera- ture survey. Nir Ozdor, Mark Dulger, and Eran Sher, Ben-Gurion Univ. Cyclic variability has long been recognized as limiting the range of operating conditions os spark ignition engines, in particular, under lean and highly diluted operation conditions. Previous studies have shown that if cyclic variability could have been eliminated, there would be a 10% increase in the power output for the same fuel consumption. The cyclic variability results also in high levels of variation in the engine speed that is interpreted as poor driveability. At full load, some of the cycles tend to knock, while some others may not have complete combustion by the time the exhaust valve opens. The cyclic variability is usually attributed to the result of random fluctuations in equivalence ratio and flow field due to the turbulent nature of the flow in the cylinder. These spatial fluctuations that are also time-dependent, contribute to an imperfect mixing of the cylin- der content, partial stratification, random convection of the spark kernel away from the electrodes, random heat transfer from the burning kernel to the spark electrodes, etc. During the last decade, extensive researches have enriched our knowledge in this subject. It is the purpose of the present paper to review and discuss the different indicators of cyclic variability used in the literature, to evaluate the relative contribution of the various factors by means of a literature survey, and to designate the best operation conditions to minimize the cycle-by-cycle variations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940988. PLIF measurements of the cyclic variation of mix- ture concentration in a SI engine. Fu-Quan Zhao, Imperial Col- lege of Science and Technology; and Masahiko Taketomi, Keiya Nishida, and Hiroyuki Hiroyasu, University of Hiroshima. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique was employed to perform the quantitative measurements of the cyclic variation of mixture concentration in the combustion chamber of a spark ignition (SI) engine. Nitrogen dioxide was used as the fluores- cence tracer to simulate the fuel vapor. A Nd:YAG laser operated at its second harmonic wavelength was employed as the light source. The original engine was modified to introduce laser sheet light into the combustion chamber and the induced fluorescence was captured by a CCD camera fitted with a gated image intensifier. The measurements were done at the engine crank angles of 180°~200° ATDC with the engine speeds of 200-400 rpm and the injection timings of -70°, 50°, and 100° ATDC. A theoretical analysis was made to describe the cyclically varying characteristics of the mix- ture concentration. The results show that the random distribution of the heterogeneous mixture lumps inside the engine combustion chamber plays a dominant role in causing the cyclic variation of mixture concentration. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940989. Time-resolved measurement of fuel transient behav- ior and cycle to cycle variation of local fuel/air equivalence ratio in gasoline engines. C. F. Li, Q. C. Duan, F. Maroteaux, and M. Murat, Université Paris. In this paper, the fuel excursion and cyclic variation of the fuel/ air equivalence ratio have been studied by means of a catalytic hot wire sonic nozzle probe. This probe, developed in our laboratory, is simple to construct and very sensitive to fuel/air equivalence ratio with a time response less than 400ps. Transient fuel excursions were studied on an engine with multipoint fuel injection during different transient operations (starting, fast throttle opening and closing). The influence of the coolant temperature was also investigated. The measurement of cycle to cycle variation of the fuel/air equivalence ratio was carried out on both a multipoint stoichiometric fuel injec- tion engine and a lean burn SI engine (direct fuel injection). The influences of engine speed, load and injection timing were investi- gated. The fuel used was unleaded gasoline and all the measure- ments were carried out without combustion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940990. The influence of different frequencies in the turbu- lence on early flame development in a spark ignition engine. Bengt Johansson, Lund Institute of Technology. Two-components cycle-resolved Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements were performed with high data rate to resolve the flow in a spark ignition engine. The velocity measurements were then processed with both a frequency and a time domain filtering technique to obtain the level of turbulence at different frequencies. Simultaneous cylinder pressure measurements gave information of the duration of the early flame development through a heat release calculation. The initial combustion rate was correlated to the turbu- lence at different frequencies and the results showed a higher corre- lation for the high frequencies (4-6 kHz) when the engine was run at 700 rpm. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940991.

This paper presents a new-generation, lightweight, 3-liter V6 engine that has been developed for use in the next Nissan Maxima. The distinctive features of this new engine, VQ30DE, is its com- pact, lightweight design and excellent fuel economy. The basic con- struction of the engine is characterized by its 60- degree V6 configu- ration, chain-driven DOHC and high-pressure die cast aluminum cylinder block. A two-way cooling system was adopted with the aim of shortening the warm-up time of the cylinder liners. The new engine has been designed to comply with the tougher emissions standards, the OBD-II requirements and California's new evaporative emission standard. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 126</page><page sequence="126">940992-941001 940992. (SP- 1017) An analysis of friction reduction tech- niques for the direct- acting valve train system of a new- generation lightweight 3-liter V6 Nissan engine. Akira Katoh and Yoshiteru Yasuda, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. An investigation was made of techniques for reducing the fric- tion of lightweighted direct-acting valve train systems. The tech- niques examined included improving the cam/follower surface fin- ish and reducing the valve spring load. The characteristics of each approach and the valve train friction reduction obtained with each one were clarified by experimentation and analysis. As a result, the friction reduction techniques analyzed in this work reduce the friction level of a direct-acting valve train by approximately 40% in comparison with the previous valve train. These techniques have been applied for the direct-acting valve train system of new-generation, lightweight, 3-liter V6 Nissan engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940993. (SP- 101 7) Application of prediction noise and vibra- tion analysis to the development of a new-generation lightweight 3-liter V6 Nissan engine. Katsuto Yamanouchi, Kikuo Yamashita, Naohisa Mamiya, Tatsuo Yamazaki, and Ichiro Yamazaki, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. The target performance of a new engine has to be obtained under various restrictions such as cost and weight. It is particularly impor- tant to predict the engine noise and vibration performance at an early stage. For this purpose the analytical methods have been developed, which include the prediction of the absolute noise and vibration level by inputting a given exciting force into the model. These methods were applied to the development of the new engine. As a result, the characteristics of an aluminum cylinder block were used effectively to achieve a new lightweight V6 engine with low noise and vibration levels. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940994. (SP- 101 7) Manufacturing methods for a new- generation lightweight 3-liter V6 Nissan engine. Naoaki Miura, Juichiro Shima, Hiroshi Onitsuka, Kenzo Seki, and Toshiharu Sakai, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes various methods and technologies that have been newly implemented for manufacturing a new-generation V 6 engine with high product quality and at low cost. This new engine, the VQ30DE, is mounted in the latest Maxima model. Design for manufacturability was pursued through concurrent engineering between the product development and production engineering department from the initial stage and included the development of a new system for evaluating productivity. A new engine plant was also constructed which adopts new automation facilities to minimize production time. These new approaches support the production of a high-quality, high-reliability engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940995. (SP- 101 7) Weight reduction and nose refinement of the Hyundai 1.5 liter powertrain. Sang-Kwon Lee, Seung-Dong Yeo, Bong-Ju Kim, and Il-Hyun Rho, Hyundai Motor Co. The weight reduction and noise refinement of powertrain has been a major concern in automotive industry although they are known as self trade-off. This paper presents various methods to deal with those problems for new Hyundai 1.5 liter powertrain. It was possible to reduce the weight of powertrain by using plastic for both headcover and intake manifold, aluminum for crankshaft damper pulley and stainless steel for exhaust manifold and by reducing the general thickness of cylinder block. On the other hand, the noise refinement of vibration in the powertrain was made by optimizing the engine structure and by adapting the hydraulic lash adjuster valve train system, which was proved to be effective in mechanical noise of engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 940996. (SP- 101 7) Air and liquid cooled aluminum engine block development. Chung M. Suh and Jeong J. Park, Kia Motors Corp. Aluminum is the material for lighter structural components, and is also advantageous for the purpose of heat transfer. The automo- tive powerplant requires an efficient material with less weight and proper thermal characteristics, as demanded by early aviation appli- cations, due to the recent necessity for environmental and energy conservation. However, cast iron has been the dominant material used for engine blocks because of simple economic reasons. To overcome the simple cost disadvantages of aluminum engine block application, it is necessary to utilize the full potential of the material to the proper advantage. New aluminum engine blocks with a unique cooling system of air assisted water cooling were developed. The basic design concept between cast iron and aluminum are the same, except for the design differences due to the structural stiffness of both materials. How- ever, there are thermal property differences between aluminum and cast iron other than stiffness and weight. Therefore, the design method of the aluminum engine block was altered to take advantage of the thermal property. Practically, aviation and motorcycle engines use the air cooled aluminum block because of the lighter mass and high thermal con- ductivity of aluminum. This report describes a unique aluminum engine block for passenger vehicles. The cooling system is an air assisted water cooling method; the water jacket was shortened for upper core and thin fins replace lower part of core to dissipate the heat where the temperature is relatively low. This yields the reduc- tion of radiator capacity and water pump size. It has also achieved significant reduction of block mass without loss of performance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941000. AUTOPASS: automated parking support system. D. Gorinevsky, A. Kapitanovsky, and A. Goldenberg, University of Toronto. This paper describes the development of an efficient automated parking support system for passenger cars. By using recent advances in the Artificial Neural Network technology and a classical combi- nation of linear feedback and feedforward control, we propose a novel design of the parking motion controller. The paper presents the results of the controller design and analy- sis, including parking problem analysis, feedback controller stability analysis, formulation and optimal solution of the parking trajectory planning problem, and design of a novel parking motion planning architecture based on a Radial Basis Function network. Three gen- eral cases of backward parking considered in this work are emulated using the proposed controller. The emulation results reveal high efficiency of the presented approach and demonstrate that the pro- posed system can be implemented on a typical passenger car. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941001. Improved traffic control integration through soft- ware emulation. Edmond Chin-Ping Chang, Texas A &amp; M Univ. Modern traffic control devices and traffic management systems designs have become increasingly sophisticated by integrating hard- ware and software components to solve specific real-time control and monitoring problems, owever, many minor system design and operation defects are often unavoidable and difficult to detect. These minor design defects which sometimes go unnoticed, may often yield misleading information, cause misunderstanding during sys- tem implementation, and may even defeat the original system design objectives. This paper describes an innovative, integrated testing procedures for system verification and validation. This process is used in the implementation of a truck warning device for operational safety on directional freeway interchange ramps. The system has been imple- mented successfully at the interchange located at US 59 and Loop 610 in Houston, Texas. 127</page><page sequence="127">941002-941013 941002. Greatly improved use of roadside passive listening device. Robert D. James, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. It has been demonstrated by AT&amp;T and others that passive listen- ing devices by the roadside can effectively perform the task of a loopback detector. However, in addition to getting exact counts of vehicles by lane, the acoustic detector can provide additional infor- mation such as vehicle speed, vehicle type, and even vehicle mainte- nance requirements. With a few algorithmic alterations it is possible to significantly lower the cost of these already inexpensive systems. These algorithms allow us to develop a system that uses a PC and a single microphone to accomplish the tasks of a loop-back detector and more. 941003. An automated highway system employing "smart highway" infrastructure and "dumb cars". Robert D. James, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. The Automated Highway System described here is a transponder (or beacon) based system. Much of the Automated Highway System community has taken the approach of making "Smart Cars" with all forms of complex sensors on board the vehicle. This system has taken all these complex sensors off the vehicle and has only left the actuators and communications necessary to control the vehicle remotely on the vehicle. In addition, this system has eliminated the need for complex roadside sensors by using cooperation between the vehicle and roadside infrastructure. 941004. Intelligent mobile data networks offer cost-effect solution to today's transportation challenges. Charlie Taylor, Pinpoint Communications Inc. The purpose of this paper is to present a new technology concept to the automotive engineering profession that will compel new thought in the area of IVHS. Existing communications and commu- nications infrastructure approaches are not practical and do not have the capacity to serve the large potential number of IVHS partici- pants. What's needed is an entirely new network that has a high capacity and low cost of entry. Both of these conditions must be accompanied by the integration of vehicle location and mobile data communications in order to bring value to IVHS. 941007. Parking management systems - The City of Chicago: a case study. Katherine L. Eveleth, EDS Corp. The City of Chicago found just the right ticket for increasing rev- enues: the age-old parking ticket, but with a new high-tech twist. The results have gotten attention - both from other cities interested in emulating Chicago's success, and from the city's own citizens who are finding their own new twist to the parking ticket: this one's for real. 941008. (SP- 1032) Six speeds for the price of four: a simple and compact automatic transaxle. David Ganoung, Consultant. A novel transaxle configuration combines two main concepts. The first of these achieves spacing of six forward and two reverse gear ratios that is unparalleled for a planetary geartrain. The second concept keeps the transaxle from being any more complex than cur- rent production four-speed transaxles, as well as providing ancillary benefits such as enhanced torsional damping and improved durabil- ity of planet pinion bearings. Also presented is a powertrain config- uration that utilizes a "T- drive" variation of the six-speed trans- axle, but with its horizontally opposed engine mounted longitudi- nally. 941009. (SP- 1032) Development of a shift quality metric for an automatic transmission. Leo E. Schwab, General Motors Corp. An automatic transmission shift quality metric has been devel- oped which uses the vehicle's fore/aft acceleration and correlates it with various driver's subjective ratings. Four components were extracted from the single fore/aft acceler- ation signal which relate to the human subjective response and vehi- cle resonance condition. These components were: peak- to-peak amplitude of a filtered acceleration, peak-to-peak jerk, maximum average power, and 10-14 Hz frequency content. They were then mapped using liner regression and a nonlinear neural network mod- eling technique to the various driver's subjective responses. Good correlation between the subjective ratings and the four signal com- ponents occurred for low shift disturbance when using linear regres- sion mapping. Excellent correlation existed for all shift disturbances when using the nonlinear neural network mapping. A computer program was written to automate the data collection and analysis. Test methods were developed for creating the subjec- tive relationships and for benchmarking the shift quality of other vehicles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941010. (SP- 1032) Torque pedal for a car with a continuously variable transmission. Esfandiar Shafai, Andreas Schmid, and Hans P. Geering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. For a new concept of a hybrid drive line developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), a torque pedal interpretation for the accelerator pedal is investigated. For this purpose, based on a simple nonlinear model of the drive line, a robust nonlinear con- troller is developed. The controller consists of a nonlinear feedfor- ward controller supported by a nonlinear estimator and a simple lin- ear feedback controller. The robust performance of the control sys- tem developed is confirmed by simulations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941011. Computer simulation of vibrations in vehicle powertrains considering nonlinear effects in clutches and man- ual transmissions. Andreas Laschet, ARLA Maschinentechnik GmbH. A Simulation software has been developed to determine the dynamic behavior of vehicle powertrains in time domain. The simu- lation method presented in this paper considers both liner and non- linear effects in torsional vibration systems. Thus, superimposed effects like gear rattling, clutch behavior, slipping, with any periodi- cal or transient excitations can be taken into account. Computer sim- ulation may be used effectively to design best powertrain configura- tion and therefore to minimize vibrations and noise. 941012. (SP- 1032) Enumeration of epicyclic-type automatic transmission gear trains. Goutam Chatterjee and LKung-Wen Tsai, University of Maryland. An automotive transmission maintains a proper equilibrium between the power and torque produced by an engine and those demanded by the drive wheels. Most automatic transmissions employ some kind of epicyclic gear mechanisms to achieve the above purpose. The first step in the design process of such a mecha- nism involves finding a configuration that provides a set of desired speed ratios, and meets other dynamic and kinematic requirements. In this work, the kinematic structural characteristics of epicyclic gear mechanisms have been identified, and a methodology is formu- lated to systemically enumerate all possible configurations of such mechanisms. This is achieved by defining a canonical graph to rep- resent the mechanisms. Graphs of mechanisms with up to ten links have been generated using this methodology. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941013. (SP- 1032) Smooth gear shift control system using estimated torque. Toshimichi Minowa, Hiroshi Kimiira, Junichi Ishii, Shigeki Morinaga, Takashi Shiraishi, and Naoyuki Ozaki, Hitachi Ltd. An automotive powertrain total control system using estimated output shaft torque has been investigated in order to enhance driva- bility and improve fuel economy. This system provides efficient control for both the engine and transmission which leads to an enhancement in drivability by reducing shocks during gear shifts. 128</page><page sequence="128">941013-941019 This paper describes a new smooth gear shift control method using the total control system. By use of the estimated output shaft torque, it is possible to detect accurately the fluctuation condition and the start time of the inertia phase, which are important factors affecting shock occurrence. Torque feedback got from estimated torque, was applied to the control of engine output shaft torque dur- ing shifts. The optimum hydraulic pressure, also got from estimated torque, was applied to the clutch of the transmission during shifts. The estimated output shaft torque of a hydraulic torque converter was calculated using the input/output shaft speed signal of the hydraulic torque converter and the hydraulic torque converter char- acteristics. A test vehicle utilizing an electronically controlled throttle valve was developed to verify the new smooth gear shift control method. The total control system reduced shock during 1-2 upshift by nearly 35%. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941014. (SP- 1032) A study on the transient characteristics of automatic transmission with detailed dynamic modeling. Young Heub Kim and Jinseung Yang, Hyundai Motor Co.; and Jang Moo Lee, Seoul National Univ. Transient characteristics during gear ratio change including the disturbance of output torque have been important issues in the study of passenger car automatic transmission. In this paper, to investigate the transient characteristics during gear ratio change, a detailed dynamic model of the power transmission system of a passenger car focused on the automatic transmission was proposed and the gov- erning dynamic equations were derived and solved. The results of simulation showed good agreements with the experimental data. It was proved that the suggested dynamic model is very useful to ana- lyze the phenomena occurred during the speed ratio change. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941015. Influence of a fuel additive on the performance and emissions of a medium-duty diesel engine. David B. Kittelson, Imad S. Abdul-Khalek, Yong Chen, Cao-Jian Du, David J. Haugen, and Eivind Stenersen, University of Minnesota. This report describes tests of a fuel additive in a medium- duty, high-swirl, direct-injection diesel engine. The additive was found to have little influence on general combustion performance of on NOx emissions. On the other hand, it had a profound effect on particulate emissions. This was most clear under high load where particle emis- sions are highest. Here, when the engine was switched from running on the base fuel to the additive treated fuel, particle emissions at first increased and then fell to levels about 40% lower (by particle vol- ume) than those initially produced by the base fuel. The additive had a long lasting effect. After running with the additive for about 25 hours, emission levels with the base fuel were only slightly higher than those with the additive treated fuel. We believe that the additive action is associated with a combination of cleaning and surface con- ditioning. More work should be done to understand the relative importance of these two mechanisms. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941016. Effect of fuel composition on exhaust gas emissions from DI and DI impingement diffusion combustion diesel engines. Mitsuo Tamanouchi and Yukio Akasaka, Kyodo Oil Tech- nical Research Center Co., Ltd. The effect of the fuel properties on diesel exhaust emissions was investigated using a commercial DI diesel and a prototype diesel engine with fuel jet impingement (OSKA-DH). The new type of die- sel engine has a unique concept for the mixture formation process and is regarded as a clean diesel engine. Four types of fuels were prepared to investigate the effect of fuel properties such as cetane number, composition, oxygen content in fuel and oxygenate type on exhaust emissions for both the engines. The decrease in cetane number caused an increase in NOx and a decrease in PM for the DI diesel engine because of the long igni- tion delay. However, in case of the OSHA-DH engine, a decrease in cetane number seldom caused an increase in PM emission. Although NOx and PM from aromatic fuel were higher than those from paraffinic fuel, the fuel effect for the OSKA-DH engine was smaller than that for the DI diesel engine. From the evaluation of oxygenates, it became clear that the oxygen in fuel can reduce emis- sion for both engines with and without EGR. So the combination of the new type of diesel engine, that is the engine with fuel impinge- ment and a strong squish flow, and fuel with oxygenate is one of the possible fuels to obtain a low exhaust emission. 941017. The thermal stability of a peroxide-based cetane improvement additive. H. S. Kesling, Jr., Frank J. Liotta, Jr., and Manish Nandi, ARCO Chemical Co. The implementation of stringent diesel engine emissions regula- tions is growing worldwide. The use of high cetane diesel fuels is one of the more cost effective options that can be used to reduce engine emissions. Both organic nitrates and peroxides are effective chemical cetane improvers. While, nitrate- based ignition improvers have enjoyed longstanding commercial use, peroxides have only found limited use. Peroxides are typically perceived as having detrimental effects on fuel stability. For most, but not all peroxides, this perception is correct. The poor fuel stability observed in fuels containing perox- ides results from the formation of radical species via peroxide decomposition. A peroxide with sufficient stability to prevent radi- cal formation will avoid fuel compatibility issues. A di-alkyl perox- ide has been identified that has minimal impact on fuel quality. The thermal stability of this peroxide will be compared to that of ethyl- hexyl nitrate. Data on the decomposition of the peroxide and ethyl- hexyl nitrate in diesel fuel at elevated temperatures will be pres- ented. The data presented includes rates and energies of thermal decomposition. Diesel fuel is subjected to elevated temperatures in the injection systems of modern diesel engines. The effect on cetane number of exposing the cetane improved fuels to elevated tempera- tures will be discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941018. Relationships between fuel properties and composi- tion and diesel engine combustion performance and emissions. T. W. Ryan, J. Erwin, R. L. Mason, and D. S. Moulton, Southwest Research Institute. Five different diesel fuel feedstocks were processed to two levels of aromatic (0.05 sulfur, and then 10 percent) content. These materi- als were distilled into 6 to 8 narrow boiling range fractions that were each characterized in terms of the properties and composition. The fractions were also tested at five different speed load conditions in a single cylinder engine where high speed combustion data and emissions measurements were obtained. Linear regression analysis was used to develop relationships between the properties and com- positions and the combustion and emissions characteristics as deter- mined in the engine. The results are presented in the form of the regression equations and discussed in terms of the relative impor- tance of the various properties in controlling the combustion and emissions characteristics. The results of these analysis confirm the importance of aromatic content on the cetane number, the smoke and the NOx emissions. 941019. Analysis of petroleum fuels by midband infrared spectroscopy. G. E. Fodor, Southwest Research Institute. A new analytical method based on midbank infrared spectros- copy on the 4,000-400 cm'1 wavenumber region has been developed that allows for rapid and reliable measurement of several pertinent fuel properties simultaneously. The method may be automated and, by using commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) equipment, would be eminently suitable for laboratory and field applications. Preliminary studies show that midband infrared spectroscopic data may be calibrated to determine those fuel properties that are due to chemical structural features that give rise to active infrared 129</page><page sequence="129">941019-941023 resonance bands. The measured fuel property values must relate lin- early to spectral intensities, that is, they must obey Beer's law. In this study, the initially selected fuel properties were aromatic hydro- carbon-, benzene-, and MTBE contents, carbon-to-hydrogen ratio, heat of combustion, cetane index, refractive index, viscosity, and density. Good correlations were found between FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, and between FTIR and cetane number, as measured in the constant volume combustion apparatus (CVCA). NMR data may be considered definitive in chemical struc- tural arguments. Sine the FTIR data correlate well with both the fun- damental NMR and the CVCA-determined cetane number data, by inference, the correlations elevate the fundamental credibility of the CVCA data as well. Usefulness of the method is discussed for middle distillate fuels (DF-2, JP-5, JP-8, Jet A, and Jet A-l), for gasolines, and for natural gas. 941020. Effects of cetane number, cetane improver, aromat- ics, and oxygenates on 1994 heavy-duty diesel engine emissions. Terry L. Ullman, Kent B. Spreen, and Robert L. Mason, Southwest Research Institute. Several studies have investigated the effects of diesel fuel prop- erties on heavy-duty engine emissions. The objective of this CRC- sponsored test program was to determine the effects of oxygenated diesel fuel, and to further investigate the effects of cetane number and aromatic content on emissions from a heavy-duty engine set to obtain transient NOx emissions below 5 and then 4 g/hp-hr. A fuel set was developed with controlled variations in cetane number, aro- matics, and oxygen to separate their effects of emissions. Ignition improver was used to increase cetane number of several fuels. Oxy- genated diesel fuel was achieved by adding a "glyme" compound to selected fuels to obtain 2 and 4 mass percent oxygen concentra- tions. With these fuels, emissions were measured over the EPA tran- sient FTP using a prototype 1994 DDC series 60 tuned for 5 and 4 g/hp-hr NOx. No exhaust aftertreatment device was used on this engine. To estimate the fuel property effects, regression models for the emissions data were constructed. Results indicated that increas- ing cetane number reduced CO and NOx emissions. Reducing aro- matic content lowered NOx. Oxygen in the fuel reduced CO and par- ticulate emissions, but tended to slightly increase NOx emissions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941021. (SP- 1034) Recycled automotive plastics. A. George Staniulis, MRC Polymers, Inc. Contrary to some popular thinking, recycled plastics have been used to produce automotive components for some time. Conversion of nylon, polypropylene, and PET fiber waste into molding com- pounds is a well known industry. For years these materials have been successfully used to manufacture automotive components. In addition, recycled PET from soda bottles and polypropylene from battery cases have won injection molding applications. The fact is that the automotive industry has been using recycled plastics in con- siderable volume for years. The reason why these materials have won applications is quite simple. They are suitable for the intended application and they are economical. Currently, there are programs in the pilot stage to recover homo- geneous components such as PC/PBT and TPO bumpers and fas- eias. These large and easy to disassemble parts are made from rela- tively expensive polymer blends that are destined to be recovered. Apart from polypropylene from battery cases, one is hard pressed to identify other commercialized recycled automotive plastics. What about the plethora of components that are made from com- modity or low cost materials such as polypropylene, polyethylene, or polyvinyl chloride? In addition, what about components made from dissimilar materials? If we are to have a successful stand alone automotive plastic recycling business these commercial realities will have to be accommodated. It is encouraging to see that the automotive manufacturers recog- nize the utility of plastics, as evidenced by the work of the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP) and reorganizing internally to address plastics recycling issues. These programs are focusing on lowering recovery costs by considering design for recyclability thus facilitat- ing the recycling of these materials. Even with an eye on the recyclability of the automobile by the design engineers, it is reasonable to expect that the automotive man- ufacturers will continue to gravitate to their internal pressure of pro- ducing the automobile at the lowest possible cost. Therefore one can expect that certain components will continue to be made that pose challenges to the recycler. To successfully recycle post-consumer automotive plastics cost containment is not the only obstacle that needs to be overcome. I think that most of us would agree that a self sustaining in automotive plastics recycling industry would be best for all concerned. If we are to follow this line of thinking, maximizing the value of the recov- ered material becomes just as an important business consideration. Over the last ten years there has been considerable activity in the plastics industry to reduce costs and achieve specific economic/ property profiles in polymers by alloying dissimilar materials through the application of compatibilizer technology and reactive compounding. These manufacturing techniques enable the producer to manufacture compounds that exhibit attractive mechanical prop- erties at a much lower cost than the historical route of polymerizing a new material. This compatibilization/reactive compounding technology, along with the addition of certain modifiers and additives, is the strategy that can be employed to recycle and add value to automotive plas- tics. 941022. (SP- 1034) Recycling options for automotive shredder residue. Michael Day, National Research Council Canada. Automotive Shredder Residue, the waste stream produced by shredding operations after the recovery of ferrous and non- ferrous materials from old automobiles, is a complex mix of plastics, rub- ber, textiles, glass, rust and dirt contaminated with fluids and lubri- cants. Currently new technologies are emerging to reuse, recycle and recover resources from this waste stream which is currently landfilled. Three recovery options are presently being studied at the National Research Council Canada: 1) use of the material as a decontaminating landfill day cover, 2) use of material in combina- tion with other recycled plastics to produce composite materials, and 3) use of the material as a feedstock for the recovery of chemical materials by pyrolysis. Preliminary results suggest that these options could provide short and medium term solutions to the current disposal problems while longer terms solutions such as design for dismantling are developed. The advantages and limitations of these processes will be considered as they relate to viable environmental solutions to a growing solid waste problem. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941023. (SP- 1034) Application of selective dissolution to the recycling of commingled automotive plastics. Masatoshi Mat- suda, Toyota Motor Corp.; Satoshi Asada and Kevin Webber, Toyota Technical Center U.S.A., Inc.; and Jerry Lynch and E. Bruce Nauman, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Approximately twenty-five percent of automotive shredder resi- due (ASR) consists of the many different types of plastics typically utilized in a vehicle. In order to recover and re-use this material from the ASR, certain separation techniques for each polymer are needed. This paper will discuss the feasibility of applying the selective dis- solution method to the recycling of commingled automotive plas- tics. In the first stage, an instrument panel consisting of more than twelve different polymers from Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A., Inc. (TMM) in Kentucky, was selected to study. These poly- mers are typical of materials used in automotive applications and represent the variety of polymers used widely in other automotive 130</page><page sequence="130">941023-941032 parts. Next, it was necessary to fully understand each virgin poly- mer's material composition and properties, so that precise analytical data and physical properties of the recovered polymer could be com- pared and discussed. For actual processing, the solvents and dissolu- tion conditions were selected for the recovery of eight polymers, each of which had weight percentages greater than two percent of the total weight of the instrument panel assembly. Each recovered polymer was analyzed to quantify contamination from other poly- mers and from various organic ingredients, and then remolded for physical property measurements. Although the separation by selec- tive dissolution produces fairly pure polymers, their physical pro- prieties were somewhat lower than those of the virgin polymers. This point, and the application feasibility of selective dissolution to the recycling of commingled automotive plastics will be discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941025. (SP- 1034) The recycling of the painted bumpers of PPE/PA alloy. H. Vohashi, GE Plastics Japan Ltd.; and H. Tajima and H. Hiranuma, Nissan Shatai Co., Ltd. Under the concern for the global environmental protection, recy- cle has also been remarked to be established. A lot of research and technology development have also been carried out for recycle on the world wide basis. Regarding the automotive recycle, although metals, especially steel, has already been collected and recycled as the steel scrap, other materials such as plastics and catalyst platinum are considered to be recycled ad well. As apart of the automotive plastic recycle, "With paint recycle technology" for "In line painted Noryl GTX601 1 bumper which is made of PPE/PA alloy be GE Plastics has been achieved by Nissan Shatai Co. and GE Plastics. "With paint" recycle is a recycle of the painted plastic automotive parts for the painted parts without remov- ing of the paint. Conventionally, paint removal has been considered to be inevitable in the painted polyolefinic bumper recycle. This article describes about the recycle technology development from painted bumper to painted bumper after establishment of the technology from painted bumper to unfunctional painted automotive exterior applications without removal of any paint from the painted bumper. 941026. Performance consistency and recyclability of injec- tion molded thermoplastic bumpers. Warburg N. T. Lee, GE Plas- tics. A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of using post- processor polymer regrind on the impact performance of an injec- tion molded thermoplastic bumper. An unfilled, impact- modified polycarbonate/polybutylene terephthalate (PC/PBT) alloy was eval- uated because this material is widely used in the automotive industry in bumper applications - making regrind material readily accessible -and because it displays excellent impact resistance at both room and low temperatures. Samples of 100% regrind and 100% virgin polymer were injection molded separately in a prototype bumper tool. The molded parts (designated as virgin or regrind) were then tested according to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 581. Only barrier impact tests were conducted. Impacts were conducted at speeds of approximately 8 km/h (5 mi/h). Half of the virgin and regrind bumpers were tested at room temperature (22C/77F), and the balance were tested at appoximately -30C (- 22F). Test results were then collected and examined for differences in deflection, impact load, and performance consistency. Prelimi- nary results from this study are discussed here. 941027. Effects of ignition cavity flows on the performance of a stratified-charge rotary engine: initial 3-D predictions. J. Abraham, University of Minnesota; and V. Magi, University of Reg- gio Calabria. Computations of combustion in a stratified-charge rotary engine are presented. A three-dimensional model for flows, sprays and combustion which includes the ignition cavity of the engine is used to make these computations. The geometric complexity of the cavity and its coupling with the main chamber is handled by using an unsteady generalized curvilinear coordinate system. The grid is gen- erated using an algebraic grid generator in the main chamber and by solving an elliptic equation in the cavity. Computations of the flows in the cavity are presented for different arrangements of the pilot injector and spark plug and for different timings and fuel injec- tion rates from pilot and main injectors. The dominant feature of the flowfield in the cavity is shown to be the presence of a vortex, induced by the flow in the main chamber, which controls the distri- bution of the fuel and also the burning rate in the cavity. The compu- tations reveal a strong sensitivity of the combustion process and engine performance to the variables considered in the ignition cav- ity. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941028. A study on combustion characteristics of DISC rotary engine using a model combustion chamber. Yasuo Mori- yoshi, Takumi Muroki, and Wenbin Xu, Chiba Univ. A model combustion chamber of Wankel type rotary engine was employed to study the DISC RE system. A two-stroke diesel engine's cylinder head was replaced with this combustion chamber to simulate temporal change of air flow and pressure fields inside the chamber as an actual engine. The base engine was motorized to operate as a continuous rapid compression and expansion machine. Pilot fuel spray was injected onto a glow plug to form a pilot flame and it ignites the main fuel spray. The ignitability of pilot fuel, mix- ture formation process, ignition process of main fuel by pilot flame and the effect of pilot and main injection timings on combustion characteristics were examined. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941030. Sequential twin turbocharged rotary engine of the latest RX-7. Seiji Tashima, H arno Okimoto, Yoriaki Fujimoto, and Masami Nakao, Mazda Motor Corp. Many sports cars have recently appeared on the market, and peo- ple's interest in and requirements for the cars are continuing to grow. The RX-7 was developed to be a first-class sports car that Mazda can be proud of worldwide as a trend leader for sports cars in the '90s. Among many innovations, its engine is the fruit of all the efforts Mazda has done to realize a "pure RE sports car" that takes every advantage of the rotary engine. This paper describes the aim of the development, main specifications, performance charac- teristics and major new technologies of the engine. 941031. Friction material for continuous slip torque con- verter applications: anti-shudder considerations. Robert C. Lam and Yih-Fang Chen, Borg-Warner Automotive. The basic friction material design considerations for continuous slip torque converter clutches are discussed. A bench test method was developed to predict the performance of continuous slip clutches at different temperatures, pressures, and velocities. A test machine which can analyze a full-sized friction plate was also designed. Two types of shudder exist in continuous slip clutches: "initial shudder" and "long-term shudder". These shudder phenomena were investigated. The results indicated that the following factors influence the initial shudder: adsorption capability, elasticity, and "damping" properties of the friction material, as well as the oil tem- perature and the slipping velocity. The long term durability and shudder resistance were found to be affected by the heat transfer capability and the surface treatment of friction material. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941032. The influence of paper-based friction material poros- ity on the performance of a wet clutch. Takavuki Matsumoto, NSK Warner K.K. 131</page><page sequence="131">941032-941037 One of the major characteristics of paper-based wet friction materials used for clutch plates and brake bands in automotive auto- matic transmissions is represented by the combinations of resilient and porous properties. In a previous paper, the relationship between porosity and the friction characteristics of a paper-based friction material was stud- ied, based on Stribeck Diagrams and the torque curves obtained from an SAE No. 2 friction tester. In this paper, the effects of porosity on the frictional performance and thermal resistance of a paper-based friction material were stud- ied, for practical paper-based friction materials, the contents of which are varied but the geometries are the same as used in real applications. It was found that the thermal resistance and the friction performance are influenced by the porosity of the material. 941033. Tracking wet friction performance via Energy Dis- persive X-ray Spectroscopy. Robert L. Fish and Samuel A. Trun- cone, Raybestos Products Co. This paper describes a technique which uses Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) to track progressive changes in wet fric- tion material surface chemistry as the material is cycled under vari- ous energy and temperature conditions. Using this technique, ele- ments can be identified on the surface and compared with the base friction material and fluid chemistries to obtain a quantitative mea- sure of chemistry changes at the interface. Performance effect of surface chemistry change can be obtained by corresponding mea- surement of the coefficient of friction. Additionally, surface chemis- try changes can be compared with progressive changes in friction material degradation as measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) after identical conditions of use. Surface chemistry change and mating surface temperatures have been measured versus cycles at several energy loadings. Separate tests have been performed to follow friction material degradation changes during cycling. The results show that performance correlates closely with surface chemistry changes that occur dependant on surface temperature/ time conditions produced by the energy/power loadings of the appli- cation. Friction material degradation is a separate mode of change which is also dependant on the energy/power loadings of the appli- cation. The EDX technique provides a method of distinguishing between these changes, leading to a better understanding of failure modes and the energy/power, time/temperature conditions under which these modes occur. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941034. Static Friction - What it is, what affect it. Fred Lloyd, Tim Reffett, and Dewey Wyatt, Raybestos Products Co. The purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of static friction and the factors which influence it and its measure- ment. This paper also evaluates the relationship between a variety of measurements to quantify the static friction level. The static friction level is very important in equipment such as an automatic transmission where the clutch pack must have suffi- cient holding capacity to transmit power from the motor to the wheels. A test procedure was developed to evaluate three commonly reported measurements of static capacity. They were: the endpoint of a dynamic engagement (lock-up) where the relative velocity approaches zero, the breakaway torque required to initiate relative motion in an engaged clutch, and the steady- state torque generated during a low speed slip. A Taguchi array was used to evaluate the effects of the following variables: dwell time between the dynamic engagement and the sub- sequent static pull, static pull speed, apply pressure, energy of the dynamic engagement (speed, inertia), groove pattern, plate flatness, fluid type, and friction material. The apparatus used was an SAE #2 Machine. A thermocouple was imbedded in the steel reaction plate for clutch pack temperature measurements. It was found that temperature plays a significant role in affecting the static friction level of an engaged clutch. Also, the relationship between three typical static friction measurements (endpoint, break- away and steady-state) vary significantly with friction materials, flu- ids and test conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941035. The role of government and industry in the develop- ment of the electric vehicleē Jennifer L. Winn, Brown Univ. Today's conventional automobiles not only have a harmful effect on the environment, but through their dependence on foreign petro- leum, they pose a threat to the energy security of the United States. In response to these concerns, the United States government has cre- ated legislation that requires a percentage of vehicles, in certain parts of the nation, to be powered by cleaner, safer, domestically produced fuels. One of the leading alternatively fueled vehicles cur- rently being investigated is the electric vehicle. Joint government and industry research and development efforts are working toward the advancement of electric vehicle technologies. In addition, fed- eral and state legislation is supporting the introduction of the electric vehicle. This report investigates the development efforts of govern- ment and industry in support of the electric vehicle and analyzes whether or not these efforts will have a major impact on the automo- bile market. 941036. Regulating automobile side impact: a presentation of the arguments surrounding FMVSS 214. Mark Utz, Cedarville College. The upgrade to standard 214 that improves side impact protec- tion seems at first to be a rather straight forward issue. A safety problem is defined and the government sets forth to solve it. This is fine until policies and positions are taken by the main parties involved that conflict with one another. This is in part because of a fundamental difference in evaluating biomedical research data. This causes a delay in the rulemaking. Consumer advocates consider that delay to be deadly. Political stands also seem to be a reason that the rulemaking took over 10 years to be completed. During all this time everyone agreed that there was a safety hazard, but no one could agree on how to solve the problem. The major controversy set- tles around the biofidelity of the Side Impact Dummy (SID). The other main part is a push for a regulation that is compatible with the Europeans. This paper does not try to determine if any one party was at fault, but rather it is intended to give the reader an overview of the policies and actions taken by the interested parties to get the side impact protection standard upgraded. 941037. What should the United States do after the space shuttle. Eric Ricky Yamada, Santa Clara Univ. In the past decade, the space shuttle has been the key factor for the United States manned space exploration. In fact the space shuttle is the only menas in which the United States government can send humans into space. However, the space shuttle's life-expectancy is due to expire around the year 2005. In preparation for the end of the space shuttle era, we, as a country, must decide what type of future space vehicle is appropriate to accomplish our future national goals in space. There are many public policy alternatives to the question: 'what will replace the space shuttle?' First, the United States could try a conservative approach to space exploration by developing and using an unmanned vehicle. Second, the government could opt for utility by developing a mixed fleet of launch vehicles. Third, the United States could try to modify and update the current space shuttles with new technology. Fourth, the United States could choose to invest its money in more 'exotic' space vehicle programs such as the single- stage-to-orbit (SSTO) space plane and the two- stage-to-orbit (TSTO) space plane. Lastly, the United States could try to initiate talks with other countries concerning an international space agency that could pool the finances and resources into one unified space program. 132</page><page sequence="132">941037-941044 In my final recommendation, I would first look into a possible international cooperation for future funding and operation of space transportation. However, if this first objective is unable to produce any type of cooperation within a couple of years, I would initiate a parallel future space vehicle program that would involve most of the modification of the space shuttle option and all of the mixed fleet option. Along with these main public policy recommendations. I also recommend some administrative suggestions that could prove vital in trying to carry out the public policy of future space vehicles. 941038. (SP- 1033) High beam and low beam filament identifi- cation in dual filament headlamp sealed beams and replaceable bulbs. J. Michael York, York Engineering Services, Inc. A pictorial reference for the identification and location of the fil- aments and electrical contacts for common motor vehicle dual fila- ment sealed beam headlamps and dual filament replaceable headlamp bulbs is presented. The filaments and contacts shown in the reference photographs are clearly identified to facilitate compar- ison to headlamps or bulbs under investigation. 941039. Perfect engine balance via Collins Scotch Yoke tech- nology. W, Harry Close, TNT Collins Motor Agency; Wiesław Szy- dłowski, University of Nebraska; and Christopher Downton, Emdair Ltd. Recent studies have confirmed that it is possible to achieve per- fect balance of all forces and moments created by pistons, connect- ing rods and crankshaft of the Collins family of 12, 8, 6 and 4 cylin- der engines. With the Scotch Yoke mechanism there are no second- ary forces, or higher order forces, and thus the counter-balancing needed can be determined exactly. The pure sinusoidal, translational motion of the pistons and connecting rods and the pure rotational motion of the crankshaft and bearing blocks makes the calculation for balance "trivial". In all cases, except the 12 cylinder model, a single balance shaft rotating counter to the crankshaft rotation, at engine speed provides complete cancellation of the moments created by the moving parts of the engine. Alternatively, two small balance shafts can be used, located in less space sensitive spots than the single balance shaft. In the case of the twelve cylinder engine, no balance shafts are required. This paper explains the principles of the Collins Scotch Yoke engine construction and the exact balance of 4, 6, 8, and 12. The exact, closed form equations will be discussed, as well as some of the approximations needed to be made to approach balance for a conventional engine. In addition, a brief summary will be provided of the reduced size, weight and friction resulting from the use of this patented Collins Scotch Yoke technology. 941040. Car information, communication and entertainment system - Advances and new developments. P. M. Knoll, Moto- Meter GmbH ; and R. Vollmer, Robert Bosch GmbH. Future driver information systems will consist of a plurality of information components containing the classic instrumentation like instrument cluster, radio and trip computers but also new compo- nents like car telephones, navigation systems and TV. This develop- ment leads in a first step to a new kind of instrument cluster design, and in a second step to a rather high resolution graphic display, located in the central console region. To use best the display capabil- ities for all functions and to have an extendable system, the compo- nents will be connected by a multiplex wiring system. In order to reduce drivers distraction, secondary information from the mentioned components concerning safety and navigation information should be displayed near to the primary field of vision of the driver within the instrument cluster using small graphic LCD modules. Also in the non-visible region of the instrument cluster there will be significant changes in the technology behind the scales. Mechani- cal pointer drives will disappear continuously and make place to modern pointer drives like miniature stepping motors. 941042. (SP- 1044) Development of an alternator-powered electrically-heated catalyst system. Paul M. Laing, Ford Motor Co. Numerous papers have been written about electrically-heated catalysts (EHCs) as a potential technology able to provide the quick catalyst light-off key to meeting California Air Resources Board's Low Emission Vehicle Standards. Most studies have focussed on using a battery as the power source for the EHC. Consequences of battery-powered systems include severe battery life impacts, com- plicated electrical switching mechanisms, very large wires, and uncertain reliability. A more practical solution may be to provide power directly from the alternator at an elevated voltage level. This paper describes an alternator- powered EHC approach developed at Ford that reduces many of the drawbacks of battery-powered sys- tems. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941043. Engineered solutions to powertrain applications using powder metallurgy (P/M) technology. Richard H. Slattery, Pre s met Corp. With automobile groups examining current product systems for improvements in cost and performance, the advantages of the Pow- der Metallurgy process over others becomes difficult to ignore. In this paper, we study several conversions from other processes to the P/M process, along with P/mMsolutions, as the only sensible alter- native to a complex application. All of the examples reviewed are current automotive production components. Early discussion will focus on a tilt steering column requirement for which P/M is the only cost effective, dimensionally, and physically capable solution. We then evaluate both cost and product quality benefits of Powder Metallurgy realized in several conversion programs. 941044. (SP- 1027) Utilizing neat methanol and glow plug ignition in DI diesels: laboratory testing of a single and multi- cylinder engine. Wendel A. Goetz, Chris G. Barringer, and Marco Bozzelli, ORTECH Corp. A laboratory investigation was conducted on the utilization of neat methanol and glow plug ignition indirect injection four cycle diesel engines. Two engines were used in the investigation: a single cylinder engine, and a heavy duty six cylinder engine. The principle goals of the investigation were to obtain emissions data for this type of engine, and to identify engine configuration (i.e., piston shape, injector design, combustion chamber swirl, injection timing) that were effective in reducing emissions. The single cylinder investigation found that the interaction of injector sprays with the piston bowl and the glow plug, had a strong effect on engine emissions impingement of fuel on the surface acted to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx), but to increase hydrocarbon emissions. The addition of swirl tended to reduce hydrocarbon, but increased oxides of nitrogen emission. Engine operation was demonstrated over the entire speed and load range on the warmed up multi-cylinder engine, with glow plugs turned off, indicating compression ignition. On both glow plug igni- tion and compression ignition, engine operation was sensitive to the injection timing. Preliminary transient tests indicated that the multi- cylinder engine could produce NOx emissions below the EPA 1994 standards. These tests also indicated unacceptable hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. It is likely that hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions can be significantly reduced through improved control of injection timing, and through further improvements to the piston/injector design. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 133</page><page sequence="133">941045-941051 941045. (SP- 1031) The effects of vehicle velocity and engine mount stiffness on ride comfort. Myung-Gyu Kim, Chang-Hoon Hyun, and Ho-II Jeong, Hyundai Motor Co. For the improvement of ride quality, development of vibration damping control systems and isolating methods become more important. To define basic ride vibrational modes, the effects of vehicle velocity and wheelbase on the standard road surfaces should be investigated. The different vibrational responses depending on the measurement positions of a vehicle body are presented with the bounce and the pitch motions. A methodology for the isolation of engine mount systems' s reso- nance to the road input and periodical excitations of tire/wheel non- uniformity forces are discussed. Using the computer simulation and the experimental results, a useful ride model with respect to the vehicle velocity and the stiff- ness of engine mount is presented. 941046. Update: using LEDs for instrument cluster warning lights. Mark Hodapp, Hewlett Packard. Traditionally, automotive instrument clusters have been illumi- nated using incandescent bulbs. Failures of these bulbs are a source of warranty and repair cost. LED lamps can reduce these costs. In addition, LED lamps have a number of other benefits for instrument cluster designs. This paper describes the design of a hybrid instrument cluster using LED lamps for telltale warning lights and bulbs for gauge lighting. This approach provides a very cost effective design since most telltale warning lights can be illuminated with a single LED. This approach eliminates three quarters of the bulbs in a typical design. Previous SAE papers, 870211 and 900474, have also discussed the use of LED lamps for telltale lighting. These papers used very specialized lamps. This paper discusses several industry standard LED lamp packages in both through-hole and SMT package config- urations. Lighting measurements have been done at instrument clus- ter depths of 10 to 41 mm, to cover most applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941047. Optical requirements for Micro Power-Light sources. Jan Bindels, Herman Muller, and Paul Nederpel, Philips Lighting BV. The optical quality of the Micro Power-Light gas-discharge source (MPL) is such that it is well suited for use in ellipsoidal reflector systems. In other reflector systems (parabolic/Free Shape) a kind of "shielding" should be applied to block light from zones in the MPL, which cause glare in the beam pattern. Another approach is to redesign the MPL to optimize the optical quality. Thereby the relation between arc luminance, characteristics of the reflector system and illumination values in the beam pattern is important. By reducing the diameter of the arc chamber, the optical quality is improved through less contribution of glare-producing elements. From a evaluation of a range of MPLs with reduced arc chamber, it is concluded that a MPL with 1.4 mm inner diameter is applicable to present Free Shape headlamp designs. This results in ECE beam patterns with glare levels comparable to, but with illumination val- ues far exceeding those of, halogen lighting. 941048. (SP- 1033) Evaluation of the SAE J826 3-D manikin measures of driver positioning and posture. Miriam A. Manary, Lawrence W. Schneider, Carol C. Flannagan, and Bethany H. Eby, University of Michigan. This study was initiated to evaluate the performance of the SAE J826 3-D manikin in seats that span a range of cushion firmness and contour levels. The manikin measures of H-point location, setback angle, and seatpan angle (measured using a modified-manikin pro- cedure) are compared with the human measures of hip-joint-center (HJC) location, torso angle, and thigh angle for forty drivers. The results indicate that the manikin H-point provides a reasonably con- sistent, though somewhat offset, measure of driver HJC location for the range of seats tested. This study found that seats with the same manikin-measured seatback angle produce different occupant torso angles. The data also suggest that for a given vehicle seat, the mani- kin-measured seatback angle can be used to predict the change in torso angle produced by adjusting the seatback inclination. The manikin-measured seatpan angles agree with mean driver thigh angles, but the data show an effect of stature on thigh angle that can- not be fully explained by the results of this investigation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941049. Testing of elastomer gaskets for rocker covers under simulated operating conditions. Ralf Stopp, G. Briiss GmbH &amp; Co. ; and Waldemar Steinhilper, University of Kaiserslautern. The concept is for a test apparatus for elastomer gaskets for valve rocker covers. This equipment simulates the mechanical and thermal operating conditions for this type of gasket in an internal combustion engine. The test block consists of a cylinder head and a rocker cover clamped onto a vibration bench. Two electrically-driven unbalanc- ing units activate the bench in vibratory motion. The vibration bench is flexibly mounted on round-section rubber buffer pads. The vibra- tion actuators are controlled by means of a frequency transformer operated either manually or automatically. The chemical and thermal loading conditions are simulated by an oil pump and associated components operating as a closed sys- tem. This supplies heated oil in a circulation through the test block components. Further, vibration measurement equipment is pro- vided. With this equipment, the dynamic behavior of the test block can be investigated, and possible improvements checked. Demonstrated is the possibility of comparing firstly a "rigidly attached" and secondly a "noise-insulated" rocker cover, these actually bolted down on to the cylinder head in individual tests. In extended tests, it is shown that the rocker cover material also has an influence on the vibration characteristics. 941050. New reinforced thermoplastics combining dimen- sional stability and flexibility. Bryan M. Kazmer, Geon ® Co. Reinforced thermoplastics, like most materials, typically become more stiff and brittle as they are formulated to increase dimensional stability (lower coefficient of linear thermal expansion and sag). A new family of thermoplastic composites offers very low coefficients of thermal expansion, sag comparable to rigid reinforced materials, yet retains flexibility and impact resistance. This atypical balance of properties permits designers to make flexible parts without resorting to metal inserts to control part geom- etry. The poly (vinyl chloride) based formulations also offer chemi- cal compatibility with various aesthetic surface materials, like high- gloss flexible PVC or paint. Therefore, complete trim parts can be designed using only materials of compatible composition, greatly facilitating the recyclability of the part. Exploiting the dimensional properties in part cross- sectional design can permit significantly reduced part weights. This paper will give examples of part redesign utilizing the inter- esting property balance of these new reinforced thermoplastics, and quantify the resulting benefits. 941051. (SP- 1045) Airbag bumpers inflated just before the crash. Carl C. Clark, Safety Systems Co.; and William A. Young, Airbag Research and Development Co. Bumpers have lost their important functions of crash load isola- tion and inter-vehicle compatibility. Occupant compartment protec- tion has been shifted to collapse of surrounding structures, with vehicle inoperability and occupant injury not unusual after a 50 km/h barrier impact. For higher speed vehicle and occupant surviva- bility, a large crash stopping distance is needed - provided by bump- ers extended by radar sensing of need just before the crash. 134</page><page sequence="134">941051-941056 The hydraulic extended bumper was first developed by Professor James Ryan, giving vehicle driveability after a 40km/h barrier crash, and further developed worldwide in the Experimental Safety Vehi- cle programs, but unfortunately never developed for the commercial market. Our current work is to demonstrate the potential of compart- mented airbag bumper systems inflated just before the crash to cover 1 square meter on the crash surface. The airbags would be inflated to extend out 0.6 m on the front, or 0.3 m on the rear or either side, or 0.15 m on the roof. The airbags could sustain up to 700 kilopas- cals peak loads when compressed. In a frontal crash, this is enough to decelerate a 1,300 kg car at -25 Gx peak and remove 40 km/h equivalent energy from the crash event, leaving collapse of the hood, trunk, or doors for higher speed survivability. Preliminary swing crash tests are presented, along with a discussion of needed car load path changes. 941052. (SP- 1045) The new car assessment program - Historical review and effect. James R. Hackney, Charles J. Kahane, and Vincent R. Quarles, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This report is a condensed version of the December 1993 New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) report to Congress and provides: •An historical review and future goals for NCAP. »The results of an 18-month study to assess consumer and media needs in understand- ing and promoting the use of NCAP data. This included consumer focus groups and media studies. These studies indicated that con- sumers and the media desire comparative safety information on vehicles, a simplified NCAP format to better understand and utilize the crash test results, and would like to see NCAP expanded to include other crash modes. »Studies of real-world crashes versus NCAP test. These studies conclude that NCAP test conditions approximate real-world crash conditions covering a major segment of the frontal crash safety problem and that there is a significant cor- relation between NCAP results and real-world fatality risks for restrained drivers. 941053. (SP- 1030) Qualifications of the reconstructionist: dif- fering points of view. Gregory C. Anderson, Scalia Safety Engi- neering; Raymond M. Brach, University of Notre Dame; W. R. Haight, R. Haight, Collision Investigation &amp; Analysis ; Nicholas S Tumbas, Tumbas and Associates; John R. Treat, John R. Treat and Associates ; Arnold G. Wheat, Accident Reconstruction Services; and Terry D. Day, Engineering Dynamics Corp. In the early days of the automobile, when a traffic accident occurred it was investigated by the police. This seems logical, because police agencies are responsible for investigating the cause of any death or injury. The accident reconstruction industry has evolved. Largely driven by the cost to society of accident-related death and injury, accident investigation and reconstruction technologies have become very sophisticated. Today, motor vehicle accidents are routinely studied using sophisticated computer analysis. Many reconstructionists now have advanced degrees in engineering or physics. A debate has been spawned within the accident reconstruction community regarding the prerequisites for training and experience of reconstructionists. Law enforcement officers have significant training and experience in at-scene investigation. The engineer/ scientist has significant training and experience in the scientific methods. Which background is better? A panel discussion was held as part of the accident reconstruc- tion symposium during the 1994 SAE International Congress. The purpose of this panel was to promote a dialogue regarding the quali- fications and experience of the reconstructionist. This paper documents that panel discussion. The authors are the panel members. The authors were selected to represent the law enforcement, engineering and legal communities. Each of six panelists was asked the following five questions: 1. Describe the "product" called Accident Reconstruction. What is it? Why is it necessary? Who are the users of the product? How is it used? Are all reconstructions basically the same? If not, how do they differ? 2. Describe the qualifications required to produce a reconstruc- tion. Do all reconstructions require the same qualifications? Are some qualifications more important than others? If so, why? Describe the methods by which one may obtain thee qualifica- tions. Is there a best way? 4. Should SAE have a "Recommended Practice" describing these qualifications? 5. Should the Accident Reconstruction industry police itself to ensure that those who provide the service are qualified? If so, why and how (i.e., who)? If not, why not? The panelists' answers to those questions follow. The panelists' responses are presented in alphabetical order. 941054. Impact of fuel sulfur on OBD-II catalyst monitoring using the dual oxygen sensor approach. Donald D. Beck, General Motors Corp.; and Thomas W. Silvis and Stephen T. Mahan, AC Rochester. Three vehicle and dynamometer-aged converters were evaluated for performance using the warmed-up portion (termed the "hot 18" cycles) of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) and during a steady- state cruise using low and high sulfur content fuel. During the steady-state tests the catalyst performance was also monitored using two oxygen sensors designed to satisfy Phase II On-Board Diagnos- tics (OBD-II) requirements for vehicles sold in California in MY 1994 and thereafter. The performance of two of the converters decreased significantly upon switching to the high sulfur content fuel, and one of the converters which was diagnosed as passing with low sulfur fuel was diagnosed as failing with high sulfur fuel. 941055. (SP- 1042) Response of out-of-position dummies in rear impact. Charles E. Strother and Michael B. James, Collision Safety Engineering, Inc.; and John Jay Gordon, GM H Engineering, Inc. Field accident data suggest that a significant number of occu- pants involved in rear impacts may be positioned at impact other than in the "Normal Seated Position" - the optimum restraint con- figuration that has been used almost exclusively in published seat testing. Pre-impact vehicle acceleration from braking, swerving, or a prior frontal impact could cause an occupant to be leaning forward at the instant of the collision, creating a situation where the vehicle "ride-up" potential would be limited. No rear impact tests involv- ing yielding, production-type seats with forward-leaning dummies are found in the literature. Thirty rear-impact sled tests with a for- ward- leaning, "Out-of-Position" Hybrid III dummy are presented. Tests were performed with a calibrated seat set in either the rigidi- fied or yielding configuration and with the dummy either unbelted or restrained by a production three-point belt system. Test speeds ranged from 5 to 20 mph. The available Hybrid III neck and lumbar instrumentation were used for comparative purposes. Lower injury measures were recorded with the seat in the yielding configuration at all test speeds and for both belted and unbelted dummies. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941056. (SP- 1045) Brain injury risk assessment of frontal crash test results. Harold J. Mertz and Annette L. Irwin, General Motors Corp. An objective, biomechanically based assessment is made of the risks of life-threatening brain injury of frontal crash test results. Published 15 ms HIC values for driver and right front passenger dummies of frontal barrier crash tests conducted by Transport Can- ada and NHTSA are analyzed using the brain injury risk curve of Prasad and Mertz. Ninety-four percent of the occupants involved in the 30 mph, frontal barrier compliance tests had risks of life- threatening brain injury less than 5 percent. Only 3 percent had risks greater than 16 percent which corresponds to 15 ms HIC &gt; 1000. 135</page><page sequence="135">941056-941078 For belt restrained occupants without head contact with the interior, the risks of life- threatening brain injury were less than 2 percent. In contrast, for the more severe NCAP test condition, 27 percent of the drivers and 21 percent of the passengers had life-threatening brain injury risks greater than 16 percent. However, for belt/air bag restrained occupants the brain injury risks were less than 7 percent. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941057. Chemical resistance of polymer optical fibers to typi- cal automotive fluids. Uwe Strecker, À. Hoffmann, and W. Daum, Federal Institut for Materials Research and Testing. The application of polymer optical Fibers (POF) in automobiles for data transmission is interesting because of their well known posi- tive aspects. The environment in automobiles can be detrimental to POF. The influence of typical automotive fluids to the transmission behavior of different types of POF' s has not been previously com- paratively tested. A specific qualification test was designed and per- formed. The tested POF' s differ in the jacket material. The test flu- ids were typical automotive fluids like fuel (diesel, gasoline, jet), oil (transmission, motor), brake fluid and carburetor cleaner. The possi- ble impact of the fluids to the POF was increased by raising fluid temperatures recording to a fixed profile. The transmission proper- ties of the POF and the fluid temperature was continuously moni- tored for a maximum duration of 800 hrs. The chemical resistance of different jacket materials to the trans- mission behavior is shown. The difficulties of using POF under the influence of typical automotive fluids are discussed and some possi- ble modifications suggested. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941058.

This paper describes a system consisting of A/D's, D/A' s and a Motorola DSP56001 digital signal processor for real-time identification of a control system plant transfer function. The input- output data from the plant are sent to the Motorola DSP56001 which calculates the coefficients of the transfer of the plant using a recur- sive least squares algorithm. Results on the identification of three control system plant transfer functions are presented. 941067. Embedded neural networks in real-time controls. Marvin L. Stone, Oklahoma State Univ. A review of artificial neural network (ANN) technique is pres- ented. An application of a neural network in an embedded real-time feed-forward control system is described. Performance of the exam- ple system is quantified with respect to accuracy and execution time. The resulting 1 1 node network was converted to an embedded 8 bit micro-controller application and executed in 0.07 seconds per pre- diction. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941069. Thermal stress analysis of a novel design air-gap insulated piston. K. Kumarasekaran and Y. B. Safdari, Bradley Univ. A novel design of an air-gap insulated piston has been proposed which is expected to give a longer life compared to the existing designs. The new composite piston is made of a crown piece which is fitted to the base of a piston through a gasket by an interference fitting and locked by oval shaped rivets radially. A steady state two dimensional thermal analysis is performed on the piston to predict the temperature distribution, then a thermo-elastic analysis is per- formed to obtain thermal stress distribution. Further, a pure mechan- ical stress analysis is performed on the piston. These analyses are performed on an aluminum single piece piston, as reference and an air-gap insulated Ultra High Strength Steel piston using finite ele- ment method. Constant temperatures are assumed at gas, liner and oil boundaries of the piston. Also, film coefficients on the piston boundaries are kept constant. The analysis gives a detailed study on the temperature distribution in the piston and heat flux through dif- ferent surfaces of the piston. Also, piston skirt deflection and stress around the air-gap area are obtained from the same analysis. In the steel piston, the crown temperature is increased by 59% and the heat loss through the crown is reduced by 24.4%, compared to the alumi- num piston. The maximum skirt deflection for the steel piston is on the top about 0.39 mm. The weakest section is the top curve of the air-gap. 941070. Process planning developments. Vaughan Hetem, Bradley Univ. Process planning is an essential component of new manufactur- ing processes and new product introduction, however, process plan- ning developments have been fragmented because of a lack of stan- dards and the proprietary nature of this knowledge. Process planning is investigated for its relevance to new product introduction, the interactions with product design, techniques, and research and development. 941072. Use of continuous fiber reinforced composites in combustor liner applications. Jane F. Simpson and Luke H. Cow- ell, Solar Turbines, Inc. In keeping with the Department of Energy's mission of national energy conservation and environmental preservation, higher com- bustor operating temperatures are required. The DOE's strategy envisions gas turbines with improved performance, lower emis- sions, and greater temperature durability. The high temperature properties of continuous fiber reinforced ceramic composites make them ideal for combustor applications. Potential has been demon- strated in endurance tests on composite subscale combustor liners. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941077. Biodegradable oils - Design, performance, environ- mental benefits and applicability. Jeremy Wilkinson, Shell Inter- national Petroleum Company, Limited. The paper begins with a review of the background to the original development of biodegradable oils in response to concerns over pol- lution from outboard motors. Subsequently biodegradable oils have been developed, for applications other than outboard motor oils, to limit the impact of oils which are either intentionally or accidentally released into the environment. The available test methods are reviewed and comment made on the current lack of entirely satisfac- tory test methods. The paper outlines the compromises which may be necessary in formulating a biodegradable oil and the care needed in handling such products. A review of current legislation, outside North America, on the use of biodegradable oils is provided. Finally a set of simple guidelines is given for assessing the suitability of biodegradable oils in specific applications and the related question of overall environmental performance of lubricating oils. 941078. Environmental labeling in Germany - Award criteria for hydraulic fluids. Horst Fischer, Federal Environment Agency. 136</page><page sequence="136">941078-941102 A precautionary environmental policy must be centered at avoid- ing the use of chemicals hazardous to the environment, wherever this is possible. Environmental labels awarded to products according to transparent and objective criteria have proved to be suitable instruments to provide manufacturers and producers with informa- tion on products causing less strain on the environment than compa- rable products, and subsequently to increase the market share of these products. Hydraulic fluids on the basis of mineral oils may lead to environmental damages caused by leakages and accidents. However, products are already used that show a more environment- compatible profile. In Germany, award criteria for the environmen- tal label "Blue Angel" are presently created which are geared towards the state-of-the-art technology and represent a new ecologi- cally oriented standard for hydraulic fluids. 941079. Vegetable-based hydraulic oil performance in piston pumps. Vic M. Cheng and Angela S. Galiano-Roth, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp.; and Thelma Maroiigy and John Berezinski, Vickers, Inc. As a follow-up to our earlier paper, we have evaluated the perfor- mance of a vegetable-based hydraulic oil, Mobil EAL 224H, in a series of Vickers piston pumps. The primary intent of this work was to address the oil life/oxidation stability and pump performance issues for vegetable-based hydraulic oils. Although we have over two years (1991-1993) of successful commercial experience with Mobil EAL 224H, we wanted to document the performance in a controlled set of experiments using a variety of piston pumps. Results demonstrate that although Mobil EAL 224H shows a sub- stantial (25%) viscosity increase after approximately 1800 hours of operation at the maximum recommended temperature of 180°F, the pumps tested operate effectively within their respective industrial unit ratings. This paper presents information on the test hardware used to con- duct the fluid evaluations, fluid properties during the tests, pump performance testing in terms of fill characteristics, dynamic response, yoke bearing hystersis and pump efficiencies and endur- ance testing results for each piston pump series tested. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941081. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis of a six cylinder diesel engine cooling system with experimental correla- tions. Mark D. Moeckel, Caterpillar , Inc. Analysis of a six cylinder diesel engine cooling system was per- formed using the commercially available computational fluid dynamic code FLOTRAN. CFD results are compared with pressure measurements and flow visualization observations in numerous areas from a room temperature, water flow bench test. CFD was suc- cessfully used to identify modifications that resulted in improved coolant distribution throughout the engine cooling system. 941082. Modeling of exhaust systems with CFD. Richard J. Matus , Fluent, Inc. RAMPANT is a computer simulation tool developed to model three-dimensional, viscous, turbulent flows through complex geom- etries. The code is used to analyze the flow through a multiple pas- sage exhaust system, which includes a catalytic converter. The cata- lytic converter is modeled as a porous flow region that straightens and obstructs the flow. The effect of flow non-uniformity on cata- lytic converter performance is examined. The applicability of the software to a range of engine system and external flow modeling problems is shown. 941083. A CFD study of squeeze film. Kurichi Kumar, Auto- mated Analysis Corp.; and Chetan Desai and Mike Flinn, Caterpil- lar, Inc. In a new generation of unit injector (HEUI-Hydraulically Actu- ated and Electronically Controlled), a thin gap of oil film exists between the armature and solenoid. At low temperatures, high pres- sure slows the poppet causing poor injector performance. A CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) study with moving boundaries/ meshes was undertaken to evaluate squeeze film behavior and deter- mine optimum venting arrangement for improved injector perfor- mance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941085. Heat exchangers designed to meet the requirement of the earthmoving, construction equipment, and forestry prod- ucts markets. Ivan D. Woodhull, Jr., Karmazin Products Corp. Heat exchangers used in today's earthmoving, construction equipment, and forestry products applications require in-depth anal- ysis that extends well beyond the heat rejection rate. This paper addresses additional design and application considerations that should be reviewed at the time of design inception to assure cost effective, successful application for a variety of heat exchangers. 941089. Ion-exchange coolant recycling meets ASTM pro- posed specifications. René D. Wiebe, BG Products, Inc. This paper will discuss the views and studies that are currently being conducted by the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials), D15 Engine Coolants Committee members regarding coolant and cooling system degradation products and their effects. It will include what has been involved in the process of establishing coolant recycling guidelines and several recycling views by heavy- duty manufacturers. This paper will also overview the process of recycling used cool- ant by a dual-resin, ion-exchange process and indicate how proper maintenance of cooling systems will lower operation costs and elim- inate unscheduled downtime. Purification and performance test data will be shown in regards to TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) removal and reinhibition with proper additive levels not requiring the initial SCA (Supplemental Coolant Additive) addition. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941091. On the ruled-based shape optimization method. Un-Chin Chai and A. Elbella, Bradley Univ. A most recently developed technique for shape optimization is the rule-based method. It does not require gradient information and multi-level searches and is less mathematically involved. Several schemes have been developed for the design rule engine of this method. This study proposes a new scheme that improves on the method effectiveness while maintaining its simplicity and low cost. Three examples that illustrate the scheme effectiveness are pres- ented. The examples show that the scheme is superior to other schemes, when compared on the basis of scheme simplicity, versa- tility and effectiveness. Volume reduction of 57% and final stress value of up to 99% of allowable stress are attained with this pro- posed scheme. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941096. Compter-aided process development and die design for manufacturing a fuel injector nozzle. Sandeep Seth, Auto- mated Analysis Corp.; and Rajiv Shivpuri, Ohio State Univ. Higher strength and tighter dimensional accuracy is desired for the injector nozzles in order to attain high injection pressures for lower particulate and NOx emissions. Cold forming is an alternate method for making the injector nozzle which can provide these char- acteristics replacing the present machining operation. Experimental tests to study the material characteristics and two dimensional finite element simulation combined with knowledge-based system analy- sis were used to design a multi-stage sequential process to manufac- ture the injector nozzle. An interface program provides an efficient data exchange after process simulation for punch stress analysis. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941102. Reconciling empirical and theoretical views of lubri- cation in wet friction devices. Michael A. Anleitner, Livonia Tech- nical Services Co. 137</page><page sequence="137">941102-941116 Experience with wet multiple disc friction devices has shown that observed friction levels are substantially higher than those pre- dicted by theoretical models that successfully predict dynamic fric- tion coefficients in journal bearings. Recent experimental results reported by Granick at the molecular level provide a reasonable explanation for this divergence. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941108. Zero emission vehicles. Byron Stafford, National Renewable Energy Lab. Recharging electric vehicles with photovoltaics (PV) results in a truer "zero-emission" vehicle. Other papers have discussed the complex issue of distributed tailpipe emissions versus displaced emissions from centralized generating stations. The use of PV to recharge electric vehicles avoids the distributed versus centralized emission controversy because PV has minimal environmental impact. Even when considering the total fuel cycle, including fuel extraction and plant construction, PV still retains a significant envi- ronmental advantage over conventional electrical generation tech- nologies. This paper reviews total fuel cycle emissions and then addresses the use of PV to recharge electric vehicles. The data pres- ented in this paper applies also to hybrid electric vehicles. 941110. Effect of system stiffness on friction and wear. Iqbal Shareef and Haithem Nijem, Bradley Univ. A systematic study has been carried out to investigate the effect of change in the stiffness of the system incorporating a tribo contact, on the operational characteristics of a friction pair. Using a pin on disk apparatus six different system stiffnesses were introduced. With each system stiffness a steel sample is slid against two counter bodies: a smooth metal surface, and an abrasive surface. Friction force, normal force, and wear rate are measured. Results indicate that system stiffness has significant effect on wear, vibration, and contact forces. An increase in system stiffness is found to increase wear rate. As the wear rate increased, the coefficient of friction was also found to increase. Mathematical models have been developed to predict wear under varying system stiffness. These results are of particular importance in miniature devices involving moving parts. 941111. Wear of bearing materials. Iqbal Shareef, William Hammond, and Harpreet Singh, Bradley Univ. Wear characteristics of four bearing materials have been investi- gated under different sliding conditions. The bearing materials used were CDA 954, CDA 863, CDA 932, and CDA 938. Using a Taber Wear Tester, a cylinder on a flat geometry was used as a tribo con- tact pair. All bearing materials in the form of a thick cylindrical disk were subjected to combined sliding-rolling motion against a rotating flat disk. The flat disk was either an abrasive disk, or a very soft steel disk, or a hardened steel disk with and without lubrication. Wear was measured as weight loss after several thousand cycles of rota- tion. Maximum wear of the bearing materials occurred when the counter body was a very soft steel disk. These results together with the wear rate of each bearing material sliding against four different counter bodies are presented. These results are found to be of practi- cal importance in the design and application of journal bearings made of materials used in this investigation. 941112. Influence of tribo system design on abrasive wear. Iqbal Shareef, Bradley Univ.; and M. B. Waheed, Mitsuboshi Belt- ing, Ltd. A pin-on-disk test rig is used to model two body abrasive wear process. The parameters investigated include applied load, system stiffness, surface roughness, sliding speed, and hardness of the test materials. Two-level full factorial design of experiments is used to analyze the effect of these parameters on wear rate, normal force, and friction force. The wear rate is found to be directly proportional to load, system stiffness, sliding speed, and surface roughness. Where as hardness is found to have inverse effect on wear rate. Among the parameters investigated, normal load and hardness have a significant effect on wear rate. Mathematical models for predicting abrasive wear, friction force and normal force are developed. Within the envelope of parameters investigated, the predictor equations are found to approximate the behavior of wear rate, friction force, and normal force with 96%, 98%, and 94% confidence interval, respec- tively. 941113. Ergonomie assessment of control placement using virtual environments. Michael Novak, Mike Larson, and Erik Zent- meyer, University of Illinois. The ability to design and assess new control schemes is integral to the development of any human operated vehicle. Design and placement of controls and gauges effect operator effort, operator visibility, and vehicle aesthetics. By minimizing operator effort designers can insure that productivity is increased for any vehicle. Increased operator visibility helps to make the operation of the vehi- cle safer. Improved vehicle aesthetics increases customer accep- tance which ultimately leads to greater sales. This paper outlines a qualitative method to quickly change and evaluate prototype con- trols and their placement before they are ever built. 941114. Development of AI based loader-backhoe design/ analysis software. Jiao Zhang, JI Case. Loader-backhoes are widely used construction equipment with very special but well defined configuration. To facilitate design and analysis of these machines, an AI (artificial intelligence) and sym- bolic manipulation based software package is being developed in MATHEMATICA and used at JI Case. The package is dedicated for design/analysis of hydraulic controlled loader and backhoe linkage system which integrates all analysis in kinematics, statics, dynamics and hydraulics together, conducts comprehensive sensitivity study as well as design optimization and linkage synthesis, and provides user-friendly graphical output. Both inputs of design parameters and outputs of machine performance data are in the format to comply with design practice and SAE standards. Modularity approaches are utilized to make the software easy to use, efficient to execute and flexible to expand. In this paper, the basic algorithm and structure of the package will be discussed and several applications will be presented. 941115. Operator visibility analysis using virtual reality. Erik G. Zentmyer, U.S. Navy; and Dee A. Chapman and Richard C. Cod- dington, University of Illinois. Virtual reality technology permits engineers to assess visibility of virtual machines interactively in a virtual environment. Use of a virtual prototyping system allows one to investigate, in three dimen- sions, the effect of design changes on the visibility of critical machine components, such as the working tool. Although there have been successful applications of virtual prototyping systems to visi- bility assessment, there still exist system limitations that need to be overcome. 941116. Neural networks in engineering diagnostics. J. Gha- boussi and M. R. Banan, University of Illinois. Neural networks are massively parallel computational models for knowledge representation and information processing. The capabili- ties of neural networks, namely learning, noise tolerance, adaptivity, and parallel structure make them good candidates for application to a wide range of engineering problems including diagnostics prob- lems. The general approach in developing neural network based diagnostic methods is described through a case study. The develop- ment of an acoustic wayside train inspection system using neural networks is described. The study is aimed at developing a neural network based method for detection of defective wheels from acous- tic measurements. The actual signals recorded when a train passes a wayside station are used to develop a neural network based wheel defect detector and to study its performance. Signal averaging and 138</page><page sequence="138">941116-941144 scoring techniques are developed to improve the performance of the constructed neural inspection system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941117. Flexible body dynamic simulation of a large mining truck. Walter E. Lohmann and Paul D. Fotsch, Caterpillar, Inc. A three-dimensional mathematical model of a Caterpillar mining truck has been developed to simulate transient structural deforma- tion and suspension response of a large mining truck traversing a known rough terrain course. The model incorporates compliant (finite element) representations of the truck frame, dump body, and rear axle housing into a dynamic mechanical system simulation model. Model results-frame acceleration, axle housing elastic deforma- tion, and suspension response (strut pressures and displacements) are correlated with measured data from an instrumented truck tra- versing the steel speed bump portion of the rough terrain course. Results demonstrate that complex truck behavior can be simu- lated by combining finite element and mechanical system simula- tions. ¡994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941118. Modeling vehicle suspension structural compliance at Ford Motor Company using a coupling of ADAMS™ and MSC/NASTRAN™. Shawn P. McGuan, Mechanical Dynamics, Inc.; and Steven C. Pintar, Ford Motor Co. The Core Development Technology group at the Ford Motor Company is actively involved in correlating analytical (ADAMS) vehicle models with objective (telemetrie) data from instrumented vehicles. In the past, vehicle compliances were introduced into the ADAMS model by using the ADAMS elements; TIREs, nonlinear BUSHINGs and BEAMs. With the advent of ADAMS/FEA™, a data translator which provides a two-way interface between ADAMS and MSC/NASTRAN, vehicle models may now include the effects of geometrically complex component stiffness and total body compliance in the ADAMS full vehicle simulation. This paper examines the effects of these added compliances on an ADAMS vehicle model by comparing the dynamic toe and camber angles of a vehicle with rigid upper and lower control arms to a vehicle with flexible upper and lower control arms built from MSC/NASTRAN data. The results demonstrate that complex problems can be very efficiently modeled and simulated by combining finite element anal- ysis (MSC/NASTRAN) and mechanical system simulation (ADAMS) technologies. 941119. Passby noise system presentation. James Deel , Bruel &amp; Kjaer Instruments, Inc. As new regulations constantly decrease the levels for acceptable noise, it has become increasingly important to minimize the exterior noise level of cars and trucks. As the levels approach what is techno- logically possible with available techniques, it becomes more important to have as much information about the noise radiating mechanism and the relationship to other mechanical processes in the vehicle. A typical passby measurement will therefore not only be a simple measurement of the maximum sound pressure level, but will include a detailed frequency analysis and order analysis, both as a function of the vehicle and position relative to the microphone. Simultaneously the throttle position, engine rpm and vehicle speed is measured and stored with the noise data. The result is a complete measurement record as a function of the vehicle position, with all relevant information. This can afterwards be examined in detail to identify specific noise sources or reso- nances to assist in the noise reduction work. 941140. Dependence of integrated vertical-tail buffet loads for F/A-18 on sensor density. K. D. James, Sterling Federal Sys- tems, Inc.; and L. A. Meyn, NASA. The unsteady pressures acting on the vertical tails of a full- scale F/A-18 fighter aircraft were studied to gain a better understanding of tail-buffet loads that frequently occur on fighter aircraft when operating at high angles-of-attack. Data for the study were acquired during two test entries in the 80- by 120-Foot Wind Tunnel wherein the aircraft was tested at wind speeds up to 100 knots and at angles of attack for +20° to +40°. For the purposes of this paper, the tests differed only in that, during the first wind-tunnel entry, the pressure transducers were more sparsely spaced and covered less of the fin than during the second entry. After the analysis methods for the unsteady aerodynamic pressures and loads are described, the results for the time-averaged, power-spectral analysis are presented for the tail-fin bending moments. Comparison of the results obtained in two wind tunnel tests clearly show that an accurate determination of the spectral resolution and the tail fin bending moments requires spac- ings between pressure sensors that are at least as small as those used in the second test. Since the aircraft was equipped with a removable leading-edge extension (LEX) fence to reduce tail-buffet loads, the effect of sensor spacing on spectral resolution and tail-fin bending moments is also demonstrated for that configuration. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941141. Vortex developments over NACA 0015 airfoil with trailing edge jet. Nora Okong'o and Fathi Finaish, University of Missouri. The flow over a NACA 0015 airfoil with a trailing edge jet (jet flap) is investigated using computational and experimental capabili- ties to determine the influence of the jet or vortex developments over the airfoil. The computational modeling of steady flow at a Reynolds number of 43,000 at fifteen and twenty degrees indicates that as the jet mass flow rate is increased, the trailing edge jet sup- presses vortex development, and in some cases, reattaches the flow. Experimental visualization shows the suppression of vortex struc- tures in both steady and accelerating flow. The trailing edge jet may thus be a possibility for vortex control. 941142. A comparative study of four algebraic transition models. Daniel J. Dorney, Western Michigan Univ. The flow through most turbomachinery blade rows is character- ized by unsteady, viscous, transitional flow. The accurate prediction of the onset of transition from laminar to turbulent flow is essential for calculating heat transfer and performance quantities. The pur- pose of this investigation is to evaluate the accuracy of four different algebraic transition models which have been combined with an alge- braic turbulence model. Numerical experiments have been per- formed for flow through a turbine rotor cascade with heat transfer, and a cascade of compressor blades. In addition, a study was per- formed to determine the effects of the computational grid density on the transition location. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941143. An easy way to analyze longitudinal and lateral- directional trim problems with AEO or OEI. Jan Roskam, Uni- versity of Kansas; and William Anemaat, Design, Analysis and Research Corp. A user-friendly method for analyzing longitudinal and lateral- directional trim problems for airplanes with all engines operating (AEO) and with one engine inoperative (OEI) is presented. The method allows for rapid evaluation of various critical handling qual- ity parameters, such as stick-force per kg' and stick-force versus speed gradients. In addition, the effect of failures in trim systems on cockpit control forces and on control surface and/or tab deflec- tions can be assessed. Also, the method can be used for sizing of tab control systems, down- springs, bob-weights and interconnect springs. Finally, elevator hingemoment derivatives for rather arbi- trary aerodynamic balance configurations can be quickly estimated. 941144. An inviscid aerodynamic investigation of wing / winglet geometries for RPV applications. Tracy L. Bagwill and Bruce P. Selberg, University of Missouri. Wings constructed using the Wortmann FX 63-137 low speed airfoil, which operates in a Reynold's number range from 0.28 * 106 to 0.7 * 106, with the addition of winglets are studied to determine 139</page><page sequence="139">941144-941159 the winglet geometry that produces the best increase in wing effi- ciency. The analysis was done using VSAERO, an in viscid panel code program. All configurations are compared to a wing without winglets to determine the percent increase in efficiency. It is demon- strated that with proper selection of winglet taper ratio, tip setback, height, cant angle, geometric twist angle, and airfoil section induced drag can be significantly reduced. Wings with winglets are shown to be more efficient than wings without winglets for all cases. 941148. Lubrication free centrifugal compressor. Joseph M. Gottschlich, Wright Laboratory; and Robert P. Scaringe and Fulin Gui, Mainstream Engineering. This paper describes an effort to demonstrate the benefits of an innovative, lightweight, lubrication free centrifugal compressor that allows the use of environmentally safe alternate refrigerants with improved system efficiencies over current state-of-the-art technol- ogy. This effort couples the recently developed 3-D, high efficiency, centrifugal compressor and fabrication technologies with magnetic bearing technology and will then prove the performance, life, and reliability of the compressor. 941149. Test evaluation of an affordable fighter aircraft vapor cycle system. Roland J. Watts, Mayra Martinez, William Gruesbeck, and Vance Skowroński, Wright Lab. Advanced centrifugal compressor vapor cycle refrigeration sys- tems are being tested extensively in the laboratory before they are introduced to new affordable fighter aircraft. It was determined that further testing was needed to establish the effects on a centrifugal compressor system due to high and rapidly varying G forces encountered during fighter aircraft maneuvers. Flight weight aircraft vapor cycle components were tested up to 4GX, 4Gy and 9GZ on the Air Force Armstrong Laboratory Dynamic Environment Simulator Centrifuge Facility under the Integrated Closed Environmental Con- trol System (ICECS) Program at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The tests demonstrated that a properly designed digital controlled inte- grated vapor cycle system will operate in the variable G field (9GZ) of a fighter aircraft. It showed that heat exchangers can be designed with minimum effect to gravity "G" fields. The future for vapor cycle systems in new affordable aircraft looks promising. 941150. Engine life measurement and diagnostics; the future direction for the Air Force. Chris J. Pomfret, Wright Patterson AFB. Major improvements in gas-turbine engine life management and diagnostics can be achieved using artificial intelligence. More effec- tive use of data collected in flight will be possible, post flight main- tenance will be expedited, and unnecessary engine removals elimi- nated. Most importantly, real-time measurement of life consumption would enable the safe life of fracture critical components to be fully used before their retirement. A comprehensive on-board life mea- surement and diagnostics system for gas-turbine engines is neces- sary to support probabilistic design and life prediction methodolo- gies for gas turbine engines and the introduction of two-level main- tenance in the Air Force. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941151. In operation detection and correction of rotor imbal- ance in jet engines using active vibration control. Daniel W. Mán- chala and Alan B. Palazzolo, Texas A&amp;M Univ.; Albert F. Kascak, U.S. Army; Gerald T. Montague, Gerald V. Brown, and Charles Lawrence, NASA Lewis Research Center; and Steve Klusman, Alli- son Engine Co. Jet engines may experience severe vibration due to the sudden imbalance caused by blade failure. This research investigates employment of on board magnetic bearings or piezolectric actuators to cancel these forces in flight. This operation requires identification of the source of the vibrations via an expert system, determination of the required phase angles and amplitudes for the correction forces, and application of the desired control signals to the magneitc bearings or piezo electric actuators. This paper will show the archi- tecture of the software system, details of the control algorithm used for the sudden imbalance correction project described above, and the laboratory test results. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941155. Design and performance of a two-phase thermal storage unit at 120 Kelvin. M. M. Stoyanof, USAF Phillips Lab.; and D. S. Glaister, Aerospace Corp. A cryogenic thermal storage unit useful in the 120 Kelvin (K) temperature regime has been designed, developed, and tested to meet the Air Force's requirement for 1500 joules of storage in ten minutes. The Brilliant Eyes Thermal Storage Unit (BETSU) is com- posed of a hydrocarbon Phase Change Material (PCM) enclosed in a canister with internal conductance fins. The PCM has a melting point of 120 K and absorbs energy when solid PCM melts to liquid. The PCM would then be re-frozen using a cryogenic cooler before the next heat load application. The BETSU utilizes 2- methylpen- tane as the 120 K PCM working fluid and will be flown on board the Shuttle (STS-62) in early March 1994 as part of the CRYOPT II (Cryogenic Test Platform II) experiment package. The BETSU program objectives were to design and fabricate a Cryogenic Ther- mal Storage Unit (TSU) for space applications, to verify flight per- formance and to correlate the flight and ground test results. There has been very limited experience with the space flight of cryogenic phase change materials and the micro-gravity effects on a TSU 's performance. 941156. Design of liquid metal heat pipe space experiment. Eric P. Critchley and Mary E. Corrigan, United States Air Force. Although high temperature, liquid metal heat pipe radiators have become a standard component design for many high power space systems, no experimental data on the operation of these kinds of heat pipes in a micro-gravity environment exists. Issues such as which wick structures or fluids work best in these conditions are unknown. In addition, the freeze/thaw behavior of liquid metals in zero-g is not well understood. The purpose of the Liquid Metal Thermal Experiment, known as LMTE, is to fill this gap in our knowledge of liquid metal heat pipes by flying three potassium heat pipes on board the Space Shuttle in 1995. 941157. Active thermal control of parallel heat loads on space station U.S. Laboratory Module. Randall L. Thurman, Boeing Defense &amp; Space Group. The Active Thermal Control System (ATCS) of the Space Sta- tion U.S. Laboratory (USL) module circulates coolant fluid to remove heat from subsystem and experiment equipment located in racks and endcones. The system is designed to provide active flow control and parallel service to each of the various racks. This arrangement provides several advantages but also raises concerns over the ability to control and balance the flow to each heat load as required. Since the USL will have fluctuating heat loads due to oper- ation and cycling of user experiments, the ATCS must respond to the cooling needs of the individual racks while maintaining adequate service to other experiments and to the Station subsystems. This paper addresses the capability of the ATCS to meet all cooling needs of the Space Station USL by implementing the parallel heat load with active flow control design. Consideration is given to the ratio- nale that led to the selection of the current design, description of the system architecture and major ATCS components that contribute to successful operation of the system, results of development tests that simulate a variety of operational scenarios, and a brief discussion of control algorithm development and analysis. 941159. More-Electric Aircraft Integrated Power Unit designed for dual-use. R.M. Klaass, AlliedSignal Engines ; and Buryl McFadden, USAF Wright Laboratories. 140</page><page sequence="140">941159-941169 The More-Electric Aircraft Integrated Power Unit (MEA-IPU) represents a major duel-use product breakthrough, with numerous applications in both commercial and military marketplaces. The MEA-IPU eliminates all gearing and the entire oil lubrication sys- tem from today's power units, thereby doubling the reliability, cut- ting maintenance in half, and greatly reducing the support and logis- tic costs. Integratian of the electrical starting/generating components into the single-shaft IPU presented a significant challenge, adding many new interrelationships to the already complex tradeoffs involved, compared with the design of today's power units. In addition to iter- ations between efficient aerodynamic and robust mechanical designs, to achieve optimum IPU performance, the design engineers had to consider electromagnetic designs of the advanced Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM), Power and Control Electronics (P/CE), and Magnetic Bearings (MB) and controls as critical elements of the system design. This paper presents the technical tradeoffs and inter- relationships observed in the process used for the MEA-IPU prelim- inary design, and the quantum Reliability/Maintainability/ Supportability (R/M/S) improvements achieved. In addition, this paper will show why the optimum location for the high-speed, high- temperature SRM is internal to the gas turbine between the compres- sor and turbine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941160. Initial testing of a 250 kW starter/generator for air- craft applications. E. Richter and J. P. Lyons , General Electric Co.; C. Ferreira , Sundstrand Corp.; A. V. Radun, University of Ken- tucky; and E. Ruckstadter, Wright Laboratories. The work reported in this paper has been conducted by GE- Air- craft Engines as part of a contract sponsored by the USAF, Wright Laboratories, WPAFB, under Contract No. F33615-90-C-2052. The objective of this contract is to prove the feasibility of an Integral Starter/Generator (IS/G) through the preliminary design stage and demonstrate the starter/generator technology in the externally mounted version utilizing switched reluctance machine technology. This paper will report on the progress for the EIS/G-system through the initial testing stage. Comparison of the finished hardware with the design results presented earlier will lead off the paper. This is followed by the discussion of the early testing results for the system testing. Recommendation on additional testing will be presented at the end of the paper. 941162. Dynamic testing of a high power inverter 250k W switched reluctance machine starter/generator. Arthur Radun, University of Kentucky; James P. Lyons, James Rulison, and Peter Sanza, GE Corporate Research and Development ; and Eike Richter, GE Aircraft Engines. Preliminary testing of a 125kW power inverter for a switched reluctance aircraft engine starter/generator system has been com- pleted and system testing of the complete starter/generator system has been initiated. The starter/generator employs a single switched reluctance machine (SRM) and a generating system architecture that produces two separate 270 Vdc buses from that single SRM. The machine has six phases with three of the phases connected to one inverter supplying 125kW to one 270Vdc bus while the other three phases are connected to a second inverter supplying 125kW to other 270Vdc bus. Each bus has its own EMI filter and controller in addi- tion to its own inverter. Two types of inverters have been developed, one type employs MOS Controlled Thyristors for the controlled switches and the other type employs Insulated Gate Bipolar Transis- tors. The link capacitor bank for each inverter employs multi-layer ceramic capacitors to meet the starter/generator's temperature requirements. These same multi- layer ceramic capacitors are also used in the EMI filters. The measured performance data obtained for both inverters is presented. 941165. Results of a rocket-based combined-cycle SSTO design using parametric MDO methods. John R. Olds, North Car- olina State Univ. This paper reports the results of the second phase of a research project to characterize and optimize the design of an advanced launch vehicle for human access to low earth orbit. The vehicle makes use of rocket-based combined-cycle (RBCC) propulsion - a concept combining operating modes of an ejector, ramjet, scramjet, and rocket in a single engine. This research builds on previous work focused on advanced multiple mode propulsion concepts and advanced conical acceleration-class single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launch vehicles. Three systems level design variables of interest were optimized using multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) techniques. Specifically, Taguchi's method of robust design was used to identify a combination of variables that minimize the vehicle sensitivity to unpredictable changes in engine weights and performance. In addi- tion, a second-order response surface method (RSM) was used to approximate the design space and predict the minimum dry weight vehicle. The optimized vehicle results (weights, dimensions, perfor- mance) are favorably compared with other SSTO designs including rocket and airbreathing concepts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941166. Rocket based combined cycles for single stage rocket. Vladimir V. Balepin, Makoto Yoshida, and Kenjiro Kamijo, NAL Kakuda Research Center. Two concepts of rocket based combined cycle for single stage rocket are examined. Concept of SSR power plant consisted of liq- uid rocket engine and liquid air cycle engine is proposed and sub- stantiated. The advantage of LACE with mixed air+oxygen oxidizer over pure LACE is shown. This combination provides increase of pay load fraction of SSR up to 2.7% of the vehicle initial mass com- pared to rocket with pure LRE. Performance and specific mass of the combined engine are determined. Optimal range of oxidizer/ hydrogen mixture ratio is shown. Methods of liquefaction ratio increase are discussed. Second concept considers LRE cycle integration with atmo- spheric air separation system. The main feature of the scheme is that air separation system provides positive thrust at the initial accelera- tion. With the same assumption for mass estimation, the concept shows close results to LACE/LRE combination in terms of rocket pay load fraction. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941168. Two stage to orbit airbreathing and rocket system for low risk, affordable access to space. Tom Gregory, Jeff Bowles, and Mark Ardema, NASA. The U.S. space program is facing the dilemma of the federal gov- ernment reducing in size, the Congress asking for lowered costs, and the U.S. market share of commercial launches declining. While sev- eral new launch vehicle options have been studied and advocated, a national plan has yet to be adopted. Despite this, there may be compelling solutions that await discovery. This paper suggests a particular TSTO launch system may solve the dilemma, but only if some of the past presumptions an guidelines are viewed as impedi- ments to be overcome instead of "realities." 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941169. The overlooked corner of the specific-impulse/flight- speed plot for earth-to-orbit space transports: powered cruise- back, loiter and landing. William J. D. Escher, NASA. Presuming the operational requirement for powered subsonic cruise, go-around and landing in the descent phase of future space transport systems, the integration of a hydrogen-fueled, high-bypass ratio turbofan subsystem in the synthesis of combined-cycle (air- breathing/rocket) propulsion systems is a leading-candidate approach. This also yields a vehicle subsonic self-ferry capability. 141</page><page sequence="141">941169-941175 The key design challenge appears to be that of high-speed fan disposition, meaning physical removal of the temperature- sensitive fan from the air flowpath. Such is required during hypersonic ram- jet- and scramjet-mode operation during ascent to orbit. The initial design-engineering studies which are available are judged to con- firm the feasibility of accomplishing this. Detailed design- engineering studies, followed by confirmation testing, are obviously required to validate this supposition. The "low-and-slow" go-around and landing operation upon descent, very high levels of specific impulse can be achieved in low- thrust dry fan-mode operation, in excess of 20,000 sec. Such levels of performance are necessary if landing fuel allowances are to be small enough so as not to compromise net payload performance. Thus, 4 Tan-supercharged' ' variants of established combined- cycle engines should be focused upon in the evolution of advanced aircraft-like space transport systems. The Supercharged Ejector Scramjet appears to be a leading-candidate concept for such future work. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941171. An integrated thermal energy management assess- ment methodology for advanced hypersonic aircraft. A. T. Was- sel, C. E. Wallace, and E. T. Sunada, Science Applications Interna- tional Corp.; and V. Van Griethuysen, Wright Patterson Air Force Base. This paper describes a computational engineering level assess- ment tool developed for the design and optimization of thermal management systems for advanced hypersonic and supersonic air- craft. The tool, entitled Vehicle Integrated Thermal MAnagement Code (VITMAC), simulates the coupled thermal response of the air- craft's active cooling systems, structures, fuel tanks, and engines. The tool simulates either the steady-state or transient thermal- hydraulics along coolant flow paths (distributions of mass flow rate, pressure, and temperature) together with the temperature of sur- rounding airframe and engine structures. A homogeneous multi- phase model with a binary gas phase mixture simulates slush hydro- gen in the cryotank, and includes the use of a secondary-gas ullage pressure control. A graphical user interface which enables the user to quickly construct and analyze various thermal management schemes has also been developed and incorporated into VITMAC. Sample results are discussed illustrating selected features of the code, along with comparisons to experimental data. An overview of the graphical user interface is also provided. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941172. Benefits obtained using Al based test equipment on installed turbine engines. James L. Pettigrew, Howell Instruments, Inc. Since 1986, the U.S. Army has been evaluating a digital data recording system known as a Portable Engine Analyzer Test Set (PEATS) for the detection, diagnosis and prognosis of faults on tur- bine engines installed in helicopters. On-board use of digital data systems makes test cell quality instrumentation available for testing installed engines. Electronic data recording and transfer of accurate performance information into a personal computer allows the use of Artificial Intelligence methods to form and interpret the significance of the data. The resulting information is being successfully used to provide previously unobtainable diagnostic capabilities for mainte- nance decisions. Standardized engine testing and formatting of data helps low experience technicians see the relative internal condition of a gas turbine engine at a glance. The computational capability of the personal computer allows expert logic to be applied in data reduction to yield Referred Engine Diagnostic Data (REDD), Patent 5,018,069, May 21, 1991. REDD compares the engine under test to a normal, installed specification engine. REDD may not detect all engine problems experienced but has shown its ability to identify many hidden faults, thereby enhanc- ing propulsion system management. Field testing has suggested that installed indicating systems which display inaccurate readings cause many maintenance actions (or decisions to take no action) to be made in error. This paper presents results from field testing of helicopter turbine engines with digital data recording systems by a maintenance con- tractor. Engine maintenance management based on the demon- strated capability of REDD to provide knowledge of each turbine engine's internal condition has essentially improved operational reliability, maximized flight safety, reduced Remove and Replace (R&amp;R) troubleshooting, while producing an excellent return on investment. 941173. Flight control maintenance diagnostic system (FCMDS) field testing results and future plans. Harry Funk, John Meisner, Paul Bursch, and Kathleen Radke, Honeywell Technology Center. Supportability of DoD weapon systems has become a national issue. The ability to perform diagnostic and maintenance tasks impacts our world position both through our efficiency and our effectiveness. The following statements indicate that current mainte- nance methods are not capable of performing as required: • One-third to one-half of F-15/F-16 maintenance man-hours were expended on chasing problems where no defects were found. • 20% - 50% of avionics maintenance actions resulted in removal of items with no evidence of failures. • Nearly two thirds of the 900 responding technicians indicated they used Fault Isolation Manuals less than 50% of the time to trou- bleshoot faults. These problems, coupled with characteristics of today's systems (e.g., highly sophisticated hardware/software designs and low- volume production) and emerging operational environments, (e.g., reduced manpower with high turnover rates, elimination of techni- cian specialty groups, two-level maintenance, composite basing, etc.) will make the maintenance diagnostic job more difficult. This results in escalating supportability costs within a shrinking defense budget. Drastic new approaches are required to cost-effectively maintain DoD weapon system in an acceptable readiness mode. This report describes the Flight Control Maintenance Diagnostic System (FCMDS) which was developed for the Air Force to address these issues within the Flight Control System (FLCS) of the F-16 fleet. The paper includes the results of field testing of the FCMDS which indicates a potential for savings in manpower time to conduct fault isolation (25% time reduction), reduction in Re-Test OK (RTOK) and Can Not Duplicate (CND) incidents which lead to 42% reduction in spares requirements, and a 92% increase in diagnostic accuracy such that novice technician performance was raised to expert technician levels. Finally, the paper describes the future plans and recommended next steps for FCMDS. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941174. International standardization in condition monitor- ing and diagnostics of machines. Douglas Muster, D. M. &amp; A., Inc. Condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines is an emerg- ing transdiscipline ready for international standardization. Recently, Technical Committee 108 of the International Standards Organiza- tion was restructured in order that it could develop standards in the field, condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines is the mar- riage of an old and a new engineering art. The origins of condition monitoring, the older art, antedate by centuries the screw-driver- used-as-a-stethoscope approach to monitoring and evaluating the condition of a machine which was popular in the early years of this century. In contrast, diagnostics is only a a few decades old, a prod- uct of the synergistic coupling of computer technology and systems thinking. 941175. Enhancing system availability and performance in combined cycle power plants by the use of condition monitoring. Meherwan P. Boyce, George Gabriles, and Cyrus B. Meher-Homji, Boyce Engineering International. 142</page><page sequence="142">941175-941181 The cogeneration industry is characterized by two fundamental attributes. First, it is highly energy intensive making efficient opera- tion critical. A 2000 MW combined cycle power plant can consume 200-300 million dollars worth of fuel in a year depending on the sys- tem efficiency. Second, downtime costs are prohibitively high mak- ing the attainment of high plant availability an imperative. A 1 % drop in availability could translate to a loss of $1,000,000. The intro- duction of CO2 taxes alongside stringent emission regulations have added to pressures for efficient operations making performance monitoring a requisite for total condition monitoring. Increased privatization and competition has added to operational constraints creating even a greater need for higher efficiency and cost effective- ness. The paper will focus on cogeneration plant gas turbines and HRSGs and provide examples of how operational problems can be resolved by the use of condition monitoring. 941176. Three-dimensional verification of an axisymmetric algorithm for tire-wheel interface load recovery. E. E. Schudt, D. J. Kirkner, and B. F. Spencer, Jr., University of Notre Dame; and M. Chawla, Landing Gear Systems Group. Knowledge of the tire-wheel interface pressure distribution is necessary for aircraft wheel design and analysis. A finite element code, ANTWIL, has been developed recently which makes tractable the determination of the tire- wheel interface loads from experimen- tally obtained strains. ANTWIL employs an asymmetrically loaded axisymmetric finite element model. This assumption is motivated by computational considerations. Herein three-dimensional finite ele- ment models of the F-16, Block 50, main landing gear wheel are developed using the commercial CAE Aries package. One of the models is a detailed representation of the actual wheel; the other is a similar three-dimensional model but with the asymmetries removed. A comparison of strain responses from these models is used to validate the axisymmetric assumption on which the ANT- WIL code is based. "Experimental" strains obtained from the three- dimensional analysis were used as input to ANTWIL to perform the load recovery. The accuracy of the load recovery and the computa- tional efficiency of the approach are discussed. 941177. Minimum stress effect on the fatigue life of aircraft tire carcass composites. D. S. Liu and B. L. Lee, Pennsylvania State Univ. The effect of minimum stress on the fatigue life has been assessed for an angle-plied nylon cord-reinforced elastomer com- posite which represents the bias aircraft tire carcass. The S-N curves were established under constant minimum stress rather than cons- tant R-ratio. In this manner, all data points in each S-N curve could be associated with the same level of creep stress. Composite lami- nate specimens exhibited a normal failure sequence of fiber-matrix debonding developing into the delamination under cyclic tension. A trend of longer fatigue life of the composite was clearly observed at a given stress amplitude with a higher level of minimum stress. The use of a higher level of minimum stress also caused the increase of the fatigue endurance limit of the composite. The trend of longer fatigue life with a higher level of minimum stress stems from the fact that the stress and strain are not linearly related to each other. The stress-strain curve of the elastomer composite exhibits strain hardening. As a result, in a stress-controlled fatigue test, shorter strain range or a smaller amount of strain energy is experienced for the same stress range when the level of minimum stress is raised. However, it should be noted that the test results reported so far are restricted to the case of having minimum stress up to 20% of ulti- mate tensile strength of the composite. When the minimum stress exceeds a critical level, its -effect on the fatigue life of elastomer matrix composite could be quite different. 941178. Optical technique for measuring tire deformation and strains - Preliminary results. Paul P. Lin, Cleveland State Univ.; and Mangal D. Chawla and Paul C. Ulrich, Wright Lab. The main objective of this research was to apply an optical tech- nique called fringe projection to quantifying the aircraft tire defor- mation and strains. The proposed fringe projection technique, using a single light source and a grating, requires no image superposition. Thus, the measurement is not very sensitive to vibration. Three dif- ferent types of tires in static and dynamic conditions, subjected to different amounts of tire deflections, were tested. A common prac- tice in three dimensional optical measurement is that a fixed refer- ence plane has to be established, from which a fixed reference point is selected. The main technical difficulty in this research is that a tire subjected to an applied load not only moves and rotates, but deforms as well. Therefore, the selected reference point changes its position in three dimensions all the time. The experimental results indicate that the proposed measuring system is suitable for measuring tire deformation and strains, but requires some additional devices. Although the goal of this project is to accurately quantify the three dimensional geometry of deformed tires subjected to various operating conditions, only the results from two dimensional tire deformation analysis are being reported. 941179. Numerical prediction of slip energy of a straight roll- ing tire. Sas hi B. Tadepalli and Manjrikar Gunaratne, University of South Florida; and Mangal D. Chawla, Paul C. Ulrich, and John P. Medzorian, United States Air Force. This paper presents the results of a study in which the free rolling behavior of a F-16 tire was numerically modeled. The tire contact patch normal and shear stresses as well as the displacement distribu- tions were obtained from a three dimensional finite element com- puter program used at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. It is shown how the predicted deflections are in reasonable agree- ment with the rated load versus deformation characteristics, while predicting the effective rolling radius using a theoretical solution. A significant development of this work is the formulation and exe- cution of a finite difference algorithm to evaluate the contact patch slip velocity distribution by methodically manipulating the above computer program results. Slip velocities are then utilized in assess- ing the rate of slip energy generation at the contact patch, which directly contributes to tire wear. Finally, it is shown how even a low brake slip ratio can increase the contact patch slip energy. 941180. A high flux heat exchanger for military avionics - Part I: design and fabrication. R. Scott Downing, Dam C. Nguyen, and Timothy J. Bland, Sundstrand Aerospace ; and Edward M. Flynn, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. Numerous studies have concluded that improved high power density cooling methods are required for future avionics due to the trends in increasing heat dissipation, device miniaturization and higher packaging density. A high flux heat exchanger (HFHE) has been designed to optimally meet the thermal performance and enve- lope requirements selected as appropriate for future avionics, at a minimum impact to the host aircraft. This paper summarizes the design and fabrication of the prototype HFHE. The HFHE has been successfully performance tested with results included in Part II of this paper. Design objectives for the HFHE included a local heat flux capa- bility of 100 W/cm2 (at 20 one-cm2 sites), a total SEM-E size mod- ule heat load of 2,000 W, and a maximum device junction tempera- ture of 90°C with PAO coolant at not less than 0°C. An aluminum frame coldplate with a laminated copper heat transfer insert was designed and fabricated which met all of these performance require- ments. The coldplate uses multiple- plate/multiple-jet impingement cooling in a stack of thin photo- etched and diffusion bonded lami- nations for extremely low coldplate-to-coolant thermal resistance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941181.

Gottschlich, Wright Lab. 143</page><page sequence="143">941181-941192 In this paper, we describe our accomplishments in infiltrating a carbon/carbon composite material with polycrystalline diamond. This development results in an ultra high thermal conductivity elec- tronics baseplate featuring an electrically insulating coating with high thermal conductivity. This novel composite material exhibits thermal conductivity higher than all existing coldplate materials. We have prepared diamond-infiltrated composites, and characterized the resulting material including the thermal conductivity measurement of the base carbon/carbon, SEM and Raman spectroscopy, and DC electrical resistivity measurements of the integrated diamond/ carbon/carbon composites. We have achieved metallization of the diamond surface, demonstrating in part the feasibility of surface mount technology applied to the dielectric heat sink composite. We discuss our technical accomplishments to date, our objectives for the ongoing technical program and future applications of this material. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941183. Spray cooling of a high power laser diode. Martin R. Pais and Ming J. Chang, Cudo Technologies, Ltd.; Micheal J. Mor- gan, Wright Lab.; and Louis S. Chow, University of Kentucky. In laser diodes arrays, integrated circuits mounted together on a single substrate to form one level package allow higher laser intensi- ties, varied frequencies at enormous size and weight savings. How- ever, with the denser packaging and higher intensities is introduced a higher heat dissipation. Under conditions of high-heat-flux the temperatures and thermal gradients within the laser device can become considerable. This effort illustrates that by spray cooling the laser diode not only can the optical efficiency (increased by 33%) and power input (increased by 75%) be increased significantly but also the laser package can be reduced in size by a factor of ten or more. 941184. A lightweight composite aircraft generator housing with innovative thermal management. Daniel L. Vrable and Fred L. Beavers, SPARTA, Inc.; and Michael Morgan, United States Air Force. This paper provides an overview of the development of an organic matrix composite housing for an aircraft generator. The spe- cific component discussed is the main housing for the F/A-18 C/D Generator Convertor Unit (GCU). This component fulfills both structural and thermal functions. The composite housing will be a direct replacement for the existing aluminum component, and will offer lighter weight and improved thermal performance, at a compa- rable cost. The composite housing will be consolidated by matched metal net molding, and will demonstrate the use of embedded metal- lic pin fins within the composite material to improve thermal perfor- mance. The paper addresses the design development, thermal and structural design verification analyses, material compatibility test- ing, and fabrication process development and tooling design. 941185. Loop heat pipes: design, investigation, prospects of use in aerospace technics. Yury F. Maidanik, Yury G. Fershtater, and Nikolay N. Solodovnik, Russian Academy of Sciences. Loop heat pipes (LHP) are a special kind of two-phase heat- transfer devices with a capillary pumping of a working liquid. Owing to its construction, special fine-pored wick structures and the method of operation these devices can ensure an efficient heat trans- fer at any orientation in a gravity field. In the most severe evapora- tor-above-condenser regime the heat-transfer distance may be sev- eral meters. These qualities create good prospects for using LHPs in the ther- mal control systems of various apparatus, which in the process of tests or operation change their orientation in space or undergo iner- bai overloads. 941186. A high-flux heat exchanger for military avionics. Part II: test results. Edward M. Flynn, McDonnell Douglas Aero- space; and R. Scott Downing, Dam C. Nguyen, and Timothy J. Bland, Sundstrand Aerospace. Test results are described for a coldplate heat exchanger designed to remove electronics' heat loads of up to 100 W/cm2 while main- taining device junction temperatures of 90°C. The heat exchanger was designed to operate within a notional fighter aircraft environ- ment with the following constraints: 0°C minimum coolant tempera- ture, poly alpha olefin (PAO) coolant, and minimized flow rate and pressure drop. The heat exchanger was configured to Standard Elec- tronics Module, Format "E" (SEM-E) specifications. High heat flux capability was achieved by combining the high heat transfer characteristics of multiple jet impingement with the compact extended surface area enhancement of laminated construction. Ther- mal tests verified 100 W/cm2 local capability, and 2000 W total module heat load capability, with wall-to-fluid thermal resistance of 0.281 °C(W/cm2). Repeatable thermal and hydraulic performances were obtained over a one-month period of testing, including 22 hours of flowing coolant. 941187. High temperature polymeric wire insulation. Robert J. Jones, TRW Space and Electronics Group. The need for high temperature resistant polymeric wire insula- tion is recognized by the military/aerospace community and indus- trial companies. Dual use applications are here today for new poly- meric coated or wrapped film wire insulation materials suitable for continuous or intermittent performance at &gt;300°C. The new materi- als are necessary to replace state-of- the-art polyimide polymers such as KaptonR and fluorocarbon resin such as Teflon and its derivatives. These existing and qualified insulation materials are generally limited to &lt;250°C service and are not capable of meeting existing or emerging needs for higher temperature capable polymers suitable for highly demanding power generation and distribution applications. TRW conducted an investigation under USAF sponsorship beginning in 1988 and concluding in 1991 on Contract F33615- 88-C- 2909 to identify and evaluate polymeric wire insulation candi- dates suitable for &gt;300°C service. Five advanced polymeric materi- als were studied in this work employing Kapton as the control insu- lation material. The results of this work clearly demonstrated that two polymeric materials, Partially Fluorinated Polyimide (PFPI) and UpilexR S polyimide were vastly superior to Kapton in thermal- oxidative stability and retention of superior electrical properties at 300°C. Significant performance improvement of PFPI and Upilex S over Kapton were also determined for moisture, ultraviolet light and basic media exposure resistance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941191. Extending technology to drive by wire control. Patrick Donoghue, Gregory Lee Larson, and Stephan Dondoe, Tele- dyne Electronic Systems. This paper highlights the development of a full authority elec- tronic drive control system (commonly termed "drive-by- wire"). The system is designed to operate within the larger integrated vehi- cle electronic system (vetronic) architecture established for ground vehicles. It employs a number of modes which control the vehicle dynamics, track tension, suspension, and ride qualities. Through a dual-redundant computer architecture, drive-by-wire (DBW) affects all aspects of the vehicle dynamics, control, and mobility. One of the most significant aspects of this control system is its capability to alter the maneuverability and handling qualities of the vehicle through dynamic compensation. DBW control laws provide improved stability and shape the driver control commands through active feedback. The vehicle's augmented dynamics signifi- cantly extend the performance capabilities as well as enhance the safety characteristics. 941192. Reliability and maintainability - A common ground for cooperation. Thomas J. Howard and John P. Laverdure, Wright Lab. 144</page><page sequence="144">941192-941198 Statement of the Problem: Since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 the U.S. Airlines have experienced many changes involved with the competitive free market system. For one they have been forced to change their thinking which now lets the balance sheets and bottom line dictate their routes, schedules and pricing. Another is they are forced to operate at lower budgets looking at ways of attracting customers while reducing costs. Both these changes have resulted in the airlines operating close to bankruptcy. With this in mind we see many of the Airlines operating an older fleet of aircraft and not replacing them with newer aircraft. The same is true for the Department of Defense who's mainstay bomber and transport fleet is on average 20 plus years old. So what can the DOD and the air- lines do together under the auspices of Dual Use so as to reduce costs and improve their operations? Work Performed: With the arrival of the new administration in Washington DC a new set of buzz words has been circulating around DOD agencies 4 'Dual Use Technologies and Defense Con- version." With this in mind the authors of this paper started talking with the airlines and commercial manufacturers to see what their Reliability and Maintainability (R&amp;M) drivers are so as to incorpo- rate these into future Dual Use programs. This was accomplished through attendance at the annual Boeing Commercial Aircraft Group R&amp;M conference. For the past three years the airlines and Boeing have held this meeting to discuss R&amp;M issues. It was inter- esting to see that besides a different language, the concepts and the concerns were the same as the Air Force had been attempting to address with their fleet. This is where the DOD and the commercial manufactures and airlines can work together to address Dual Use technologies, Reliability improvements and Reductions in Main- tainability requirements. The concept of Dual Use is to develop systems for both military and commercial applications. One such example is Global Position- ing System (GPS) which is used as a navigation aid in the DOD but can also be used for the commercial airlines. The overall goal here is to look at the concerns identified by the airlines and see if the DOD has developed or could develop a technology to solve these problems. Since the airlines and the DOD are both trying to reduce support costs many R&amp;M issues can be jointly addressed under dual use. To improve reliability we must first identify the systems we are having problems with. In order to do this the airlines must develop a standardized method for reporting failure and maintenance data back to the manufacturer. Some of the airlines do report data but each one does it differently and the manufacturer has a hard time identifying the problem. The second step to improving reliability is to make it an integral part of the design process with performance. Some of the ways to do this are through analysis of environmental parameters and material characterizations. This allows the design engineer to understand the environment in which the system will be operated and develop a more durable product. To decrease the maintenance requirements we first need to understand the processes by which aircraft are repaired. From this we can develop maintenance tools which will aid the maintainers in performing their job more efficiently and effectively. One of the ways to do this for both the airlines and the DOD is to develop hand held automated diagnostics tools which can be used a the flight line. Another is eliminating the paper from this environment with auto- mated data systems and recording systems. One of the tough areas here is how to do this with a 20 year old aircraft and will it be cost effective. The solution is to have this be a joint effort between both the DOD and the airline industry so as to develop a product both can use in their own environments. Conclusion: In general both the DOD and the airline industry are looking at reduced budgets and leaner times. However, by working together and sharing resources improvements can be made in reli- ability and maintainability which will benefit both. The results will be an improved bottom line for the airlines and increased combat capability for the DOD. 941195. Steady -state and dynamic performance of a 20-kHz/ 400-Hz power distribution system for more and all-electric air- craft applications. Scott D. Sudhoff, University of Missouri ; Paul C. Krause and Oleg Wasynczuk, P. C. Krause and Associates ; and Barbara H. Kenny and Irving H. Hansen, NASA. The steady-state and dynamic performance of a candidate aircraft power distribution system is considered. The system features distri- bution of both single phase 20-kHz and three-phase 400 Hz power. It is shown that unlike some other recent 20-kHz systems, the power quality of the 20-kHz bus is not a concern due to the use of a syn- chronous bi-directional rectifier (SBR) as the primary interface to the 20-kHz bus. In addition to showing that the system behaves ade- quately in the steady-state, the dynamic performance of the system is considered during step changes in load, bolted faults, and sudden variations in jet engine speed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941196. National aero-space plane contributions to the auto- mobile industry. William K. West, NASP Technology Applications Integrated Product Team. The National Aero-Space Plane (NASP) program has a wide range of technical challenges associated with it. In the process of finding solutions to these unknowns, NASP has enabled advance- ments across a broad scope of technologies. This state- of-the-art work is being performed by 5 major aerospace companies (Lock- heed Ft. Worth, Rockwell International, McDonnell-Douglas, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rocketdyne), over 400 subcontractors (including universities) and 15 major U.S. government research laboratories. This variety of affected technologies and large extent of interaction with national organizations are building an important foundation for U.S. technological preeminence in a variety of industries; most nota- bly being the aerospace, energy, medical and automotive industries. The NASP Technology Applications Integrated Product Team (IPT) is pursuing technology transfer in all of these industries. With respect to the automobile industry, the team is planning to design, build and test a NASP technology demonstration automobile engine with revolutionary characteristics such as, high efficiency, low emission, high temperature capability, higher power and lighter weight. The IPT, which is charged with lowering the cost and increasing the performance of future hypersonic systems, believes that everyday usage of the NASP technologies in applications such as the automotive industry will ensure cheaper, ready availability at a later date. The purpose of this paper is to outline the NASP interest in tech- nology transfer, describe the NASP technologies and capabilities are applicable to the automotive industry, describe the NASP Joint Pro- gram Office (JPO) reasoning for choosing the automotive industry, and outline the NASP technology demonstration automobile engine project. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941197.

Dual-use technologies: collaborative R&amp;D agree- ments with federal agencies. William J. Bierbower, Federal Tech- nology Partnerships. This paper examines NASA's and other federal agencies' increasingly use of cost-shared research and development agree- ments to produce or improve "dual-use" technologies. Agency reg- ulations implementing these programs, and agreements governing R&amp;D collaborations, are significantly more flexible than those 145</page><page sequence="145">941198-941206 affecting standard agency procurements of goods and services, including SBIR contracts.

NASA's Aerospace Industry Technology Program: dual-purpose technology for the future. John C. Mankins, NASA. The Aerospace Industry Technology Program (AITP), newly created in fiscal year 1994, is a key element of NASA's program in response to evolving U.S. national technology policy. Since World War n, the Federal Government has played a major role in overall U.S. technology research and development (R&amp;D). Assur- ing the timely transfer of the technologies developed for national purposes is vital. Through the Space Act of 1958, NASA has long been chartered to make special efforts to assure that the technology developed for the civilian space program is made available for dual- use in non-NASA - and often non-aerospace - applications. Numerous programs have been implemented during the past two decades to achieve the goals of NASA technology transfer. With the AITP, NASA is beginning a more proactive effort to translate its mission-oriented R&amp;D efforts into commercial bene- fits. The AITP will create industry-led, NASA-corporate partner- ships to develop and apply advanced technology rapidly in industry applications, in the non-aerospace commercial marketplace, as well as providing new capabilities for NASA missions. Projects will focus on R &amp; D in precompetitive technologies and novel applica- tions, supporting high-risk and high-payoff opportunities. Programs similar to the AITP have been funded in several agen- cies; including the Department of Defense and the Department of Commerce. These programs represent benchmarks for the definition of the AITP and will drive coordination efforts as the AITP moves from planning into implementation. In addition, active involvement of industry in all aspects of planning will be an AITP hallmark - broadening the base of participation while building lasting bridges between existing aerospace capabilities and non-aerospace sectors. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941200. The national aero-space plane tech transfer triad: The Tomahawk missile case. Adrian L. DeNardo , Science Applica- tions International Corp. This paper illustrates the growing commonality between aircraft structural requirements for materials and the need for similar materi- als in systems installed in U.S. Navy surface combatant vessels. Based on development work done originally for the X-30 flight demonstrator vehicle of the National Aero-Space Plane Program, the path between these requirements is illustrated in six sections of this document. The first three sections describe the X-30 overall pro- pulsion concept and the resulting development of two classes of tita- nium needed to meet the performance requirements of the vehicle. The technology transfer methods used by the NASP Program to facilitate transfer of the technologies are discussed in section four, while the Navy requirement is addressed in section five. The synthe- sis of aircraft and ship requirements through industrial consortium building is detailed in section six, while the status of the program and potential additional applications of these NASP- developed technologies concludes the paper. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941201. Joining of a PdCr resistance strain gauge to Inconel 718 using an infrared process. C. A. Blue, R. A. Blue, and R. Y. Lin, University of Cincinnati; and J ih- F en Lei, and W. D. Williams, NASA. Joining of a PdCr Strain Gage with a Hastelloy X carrier shim to Inconel by a rapid infrared processing technique has been investi- gated at 1 150°C using a nickel based brazing alloy AMS 4777, Ni- 7Cr-3Fe-3.2B-4.5Si-.06C in wt%. The effects of the infrared joining parameters on the joint and base material microstructure, joint shear strength, and delamination tendency of the PdCr gage was investi- gated. Results show that the joint shear strength is as high as 503 MPa when processed at approximately 1150°C for 120 seconds, Microstructural examinations of the joint with both an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope indicate that good wetting exists between the brazing alloy with both the Hastelloy X and Inconel 718. And, the Hastelloy X and Inconel 718 exhibits no noticeable change in microstructure due to the rapid processing cycle of the infrared heating process while the stabilized PdCr wire gage shows little change in resistance. High temperature delamina- tion studies of an infrared joined strain gage show no delamination at 800°C when flexed 1 mm in a four point bend setup. 941203. Microsensor fusion technology for space vehicle reli- ability enhancement. Timothy Betzner, Chris Seifferth, John Rodri- guez , H. Thurman Henderson, and H. Howard Fan, University of Cincinnati. In this work, the goal of enhanced reliability through redundancy is explored. Two levels of fusion have been defined: the first is a fusion of sensors, redundant in both number and type, and the sec- ond is a statistical fusion of the resulting data at a software level. An intermediate preprocessing level is required to connect both fusions. The various types of sensors which are included are bulk micromachined flow, pressure and hydrogen sensors and a thin film poly-crystalline silicon temperature sensor. Individual sensors have been fabricated and packaged in arrays. Associated preprocessing has been designed to be able to handle all of the signals coming from each sensor and prepare them for statistical analysis. Data fusion algorithms have been written and tested. 941204. Development of a photoconductive gamma dosimeter for space application. Shoaib Usman, Lubna Shoaib, and James N. Anno, University of Cincinnati. Demand for accurate and reliable gamma dosimetry in a radia- tion environment and the unsatisfactory performance of the existing devices has given rise to the need for a better gamma measurement system, capable of operating in a high dose rate environment and withstanding a high total dose. The concept of a new gamma dose measurement device based on the principle of photoconductivity has the potential of filling this void. Preliminary experiments and analy- ses indicated that the selected dosimeter materials exhibit photocon- ductivity in a useful range, responsive to changes in gamma dose rate. The initial Pyrex glass dosimeter appeared to suffer radiation damage at the relatively high dose rates employed (up to 0.116 Mega rads/hour). Quartz is now being studied as an alternative material. 941205. Optical fiber coupled sensors integrating optical waveguides an micromechanical structures on silicon. Joseph T. Boyd, Gregory N. De Brabander, and Kevin Burcham, University of Cincinnati ; and Glenn Beheim, NASA. Electrically passive optical sensors have been formed using opti- cal waveguides and micromachined-micromechanical structures on silicon substrates. We present recent results on an interferometrie pressure sensor where pressure-induced strain in a micromachined diaphragm alters the path length of an optical channel waveguide ring resonator. Pressure is detected as a change in the resonant con- dition of the ring and found to vary linearly over a range of -100 to 400 kPa with a sensitivity of 0.0094 rad/kPa. Problems with attaching this sensor for testing will be discussed. Our second device is an intensity-type accelerometer utilizing a micromachined canti- lever beam. Light transmission across a gap between two channel waveguides, one located on a beam bent by acceleration and another which remains fixed, is measured optically. We show preliminary measurements of the coupling between two closely spaced waveg- uide sections which agree with overlap integral calculations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941206. Seal analysis computer codes. Wilbur Shapiro, Mechanical Technology, Incorporated ; and Mahesh M. Athavale, CFD Research Corp. 146</page><page sequence="146">941206-941219 Efficiency and life requirements of advanced turbo-machinery and the pollution demands of the Clean Air Act dictate the need for significant advances in seal technology. NASA is sponsoring a pro- gram to produce computer codes to be used by industry and govern- ment for analyzing and designing a wide variety of advanced seals for rotating machinery. A general computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is being generated for accurate flow simulations, as well as simpler 21-D codes for expeditious application. A knowledge- based system (KBS) controls the codes and includes a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). A data base and an expert system to provide design guidance to the user will be added. This paper describes the codes and their application. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941207. Development of an electronically controlled mechan- ical seal for aerospace applications. Richard F. Salant, Georgia Institute of Technology; and Paul J. Wolff, Tennessee Valley Authority. An electronically controlled mechanical seal, in a configuration suitable for aerospace applications, has been built and tested in the laboratory. The thickness of the lubricating film between the seal faces is controlled by adjusting the coning of one of the faces, which is bonded to a piezoelectric crystal. An applied voltage causes the crystal to deform in the shear mode, thereby inducing coning of the seal face; the larger the voltage, the larger the coning. The coning affects the fluid mechanics of the film such that the larger the con- ing, the larger the average film thickness. Therefore the film thick- ness increases with increased applied voltage. Steady state tests have shown that the leakage rate (and therefore, the film thickness) can be adjusted over a substantial range, utilizing the available range of voltage. Transient tests have shown that either the leakage rate or the face temperature can be maintained near a set point during both gradual and abrupt changes in operating condi- tions, by utilizing a closed-loop control system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941208. Advances in brush seal numerical modeling. V. V. Kudriavtsev and M. J. Braun, University of Akron. This paper presents a general review of the experimental, analyti- cal/numerical and industrial state of the art in the development of brush seals. The authors further present their numerical model as it relates to the physics of the flow, as understood from the numerous experiments done in the hydraulic tunnel at The University of Akron. Based on their own experimental and numerical work the authors propose a new approach to the solution of full brushes. This involves the segmentation of the brush in repetitive core segments, bound by an inlet and an exit segment. A numerical experiment is performed to prove the validity of this concept. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941209. Numerical analysis of an advanced rocket engine turbopump. Mehtab Pervaiz, Scott Erler, and Paul Delvernois, Pratt &amp; Whitney; and Jayant Sabnis, United Technologies Research Center. A coupled analysis of inlet guide vanes, inducer blades, and the following struts is carried out via a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The complex 3-D components are part of a liquid hydrogen fuel turbopump for Advanced Expander Test Bed (AETB) engine. Numerical simulation is carried out via a 3-D compressible, Euler, finite volume, time-stepping algorithm that utilizes a multi- ple-grid accelerator for steady state problems. A scaling procedure is used to approximate the flow of liquids in turbopumps. Circum- ferential averaging at suitable planes in between the rotating and sta- tionary components has been used to simulate the rotor/stator inter- actions in a steady state mode. The paper delineates the 3-D nature of the coupled flow fields through the pump components by simulat- ing the conditions at normal operating point (20 K lb thrust) and an off-design point at 10 K lb thrust. The predicted flow field analysis points to a nearly cavitation-free inducer for the operating condi- tions. 941212. DGPS precision landing simulation. Tze Siu, Tom McDavid, Greg Röbel, and Tim Geels, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. A Differential Global Positioning System precision landing sim- ulation (DGPSPLS) is currently in development in the navigation research group. The simulation provides an integrated airplane sys- tems simulation that includes mathematical modeling of navigation, guidance, control, GPS sensor, and GPS constellation. This tool can be used to develop error budgets in the closed loop non-linear sys- tem; evaluate architectures which combine navigation, control, guidance, and ground station functions; and develop Kaiman filters which blend navigation signals from different sources. Currently, two airplane models are under development: B737 autoland simulation and B757 cruise Flight Management Computer (FMC) simulation. Results on differential correction latency, deci- sion height window statistics, and lateral navigation (LNAV) path tracking performance are included. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941217. An on-line approximation approach to fault moni- toring, diagnosis and accommodation. Marios M. Polycarpou, University of Cincinnati. The detection, diagnosis, and accommodation of system failures or degradations is becoming increasingly more important in modern engineering problems. This paper presents a general framework for constructing automated fault diagnosis and accommodation archi- tectures using on-line approximators and adaptation/learning schemes. In this framework, neural network models constitute an important class of on-line approximators. Changes in the system dynamics are monitored by an on-line approximation model, which is used not only for detecting but also for accommodating failures. A systematic procedure for constructing nonlinear estimation algo- rithms and stable learning schemes is developed and illustrated by a simulation example. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941218. Design of a dependable systems knowledge base. Karen Davis, Jason Peter, and Mike Bourdess, University of Cincin- nati. Building and operating dependable systems is fundamental to many critical applications, such as designing integrated hardware and software systems for vehicles or satellites. Dependable systems techniques, methods, and tools are developed and used by research- ers and practitioners working in widely varying disciplines. In order to provide a unifying framework for the successful dissemination and sharing of dependability results, the development of a depend- able systems knowledge base is underway. Two database support subsystems are under development: one that manages the storage and retrieval of document information, as well as communicating between the user interface layer and the physical database layer, and another that manages the lexicon of dependability terminology for the user interface layer. The system will provide access to informa- tion in a sophisticated, intelligent manner that enables a human user to function more effectively in learning and decision- making capaci- ties. 941219. Generalization of an automated visual inspection system (AVIS). Bryan S. Everding, Adam R. Nolan, and William G. Wee, University of Cincinnati. Efforts have been made to utilize AI constructs to identify flaws in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) faceplate regions. In order to expand the applicability of these algorithms to a larger problem domain, the automatic visual inspection system (AVIS) has been modified to enable a user with little or no image processing background to define a system capable of identifying flaws on a given set of imagery. This system requires the user to simply iden- tify flawed regions and the selection of processing and feature descriptors is performed automatically. This paper explicates the 147</page><page sequence="147">941219-941231 motivations, definitions, and performance issues associated with the AVIS paradigm. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941220. Propulsion system modeling for condition monitor- ing and control: a status report. A. J. Helmicki, S. Jaweed, and K. Kolcio, University of Cincinnati. A rigorous propulsion system modeling method suitable for con- trol and condition monitoring purposes is developed. Previously developed control oriented methods yielding nominal models for gaseous medium propulsion systems are extended to include both nominal and anomalous models for liquid mediums in the following two ways. First, thermodynamic and fluid dynamic properties for liquids such as liquid hydrogen are incorporated into the governing equations. Second, anomalous conditions are captured in ways com- patible with existing system theoretic design and analysis tools so that anomalous models can be constructed. Applications to the nom- inal SSME, HPFP and degraded HPFP are considered as an exam- ple. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941221. SSME parameter modeling with neural networks. Atam P. Dhawan, Kevin R. Wheeler, and Timothy F. Doniere, Uni- versity of Cincinnati. The High Pressure Oxidizer Turbine (HPOT) discharge tempera- ture of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) was estimated using Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) during the star- tup transient. Estimation was performed for both nominal engine operation and during simulated input sensor failures. The K-means clustering algorithm was used on the data to determine the location of the basis function centers. The performance of the RBFNN is compared with that of a feedforward neural network trained with the Quickprop learning algorithm. 941222. Engine cold section materials application. Sandra M. Hoff, Aviation Applied Technology. Consistent with the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) Initiative, the Army sponsored two programs to substantiate the benefits achievable through the applications of advanced materials to static components in turboshaft engines in the 4.54-6.8 kg/s (10-15) lb/s flow class. One program was for the design, fabrication and test of an engine inlet housing utilizing chopped graphite fibers in PMR-15 resin. The other program was for the design, fabrication and test of an impeller diffuser utilizing gamma titanium aluminide (yTiAl). Component designs having a technology level consistent with current developmental engines (Joint Turbine Advanced Gas Generator I (JTAGG I) - IHPTET demonstrator of Phase I goals) were used as a baseline for assessing potential benefits achievable through the application of nonconven- tional materials. Work performed in these programs provided the verification of the benefits achievable through the application of nonconventional materials to cold section components of turboshaft engines. 941227. SiC devices for space electronics: Phase I - high volt- age, temperature hard contacts. J. N. Su and A. J. Stecki, Univer- sity of Cincinnati. High voltage Schottky diodes have been fabricated on 3C-SÍC films grown on Si substrates. A Ni metallization process has been developed to fabricate both rectifying and ohmic contracts to SiC by controlling the post-annealing temperature. A high voltage (&gt;150V) breakdown has been obtained at room temperature from the SiC Schottky diode. The Ni-SiC Schottky junction shows a ther- mal resistance for temperatures as high as 600°C. This technology has good potential for monolithic integration of SiC high power devices and Si integrated circuits. 941228. Solid free form fabrication - A break through tool for concurrent engineering. Allan E. Lange and Mahesh Bhav- nani, Hughes Aircraft Co. The pressing demand for American companies to be World Class producers has brought about a change in philosophy on how they do business. One major change is the approach to manufacturing. The change requires the adoption of tools and techniques that pro- vide form, fit and function in ways that shorten production lead time with a reduction in cost. Rapid prototyping (RP) technologies using Solid Free Form Fabrication (SFF) offers industry the opportunity to reduce cost, shorten schedules and give Concurrent Engineering a tool that will provide an interface with manufacturing. From the design review to manufacturing SFF parts can be used to smooth the transition from concept into production with over 50% cost reduc- tions while cutting 50% off the cycle time. The cost and time for the modifications associated with adopting these new methods and training personnel presents a major chal- lenge to manufacturing companies. Limited financial resources make it imperative that benefits and constraints of the new processes and techniques be completely understood so that facts rather than emotion can be applied when cost versus risk and return are evaluated as part of the decision mak- ing process. This paper presents information on how Hughes is using the SFF Stereolithography process to help reduce cost, cycle time and addresses the crossing point as to when the use of SFF or when it makes sense to use conventional methods for the fabrication of cast metal parts. 941229. Applications of rapid prototyping technologies at High Tech Castings, Inc. Daniel Gaier and Clayton W. Storey, High Tech Castings, Inc. This paper describes the implementation of Rapid Prototyping technologies developed for aerospace, automotive, and a commer- cial aluminum casting applications at High Tech Castings, Inc. By utilizing concurrent engineering principles integrated with Rapid Prototyping techniques, the casting development cycle has been dra- matically reduced. High Tech Castings, Inc. will present several examples illustrating the comparisons of various Rapid Prototyping technologies incorporated into both prototype and pre-production casting applications. The scope of the evaluations will include the use of Rapid Prototype models, patterns, and tooling. 941230. Free-form fabrication beginners workshop. Susan M. Smyth and Thomas Greaves, General Motors Corp. Free-form fabrication, or rapid prototyping as it is commonly known, is the creation of a physical entity, directly from numerical description, using an additive process. The mathematical data used is typically in the form of a 3- D CAD file, but it may also be obtained from a reverse engineering process. This paper presents a review of three of the leading FFF (free- form fabrication) systems which are commercially available. Time constraints will allow us to describe only three of these products. Although this does not do justice to a technology where there are more than 30 different systems in various stages of development, these examples represent the vast majority of machines which are in the marketplace today. 941231. The USAF aging aircraft program - A short history and status. John W. Lincoln, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base ; and William R. Elliott, Robins Air Force Base. For the past thirty-five years the United States Air Force used the USAF Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) to maintain safe and economical operation of aging aircraft. That program has been supported over the years by Air Force laboratory programs in the areas of fracture mechanics, corrosion prevention, flight loads, non- destructive evaluation, human factors, and maintenance and repair. These efforts provided the Air Force with the technology required to support the operational aircraft maintenance programs based on damage tolerance. There has also been a mutual need to develop the capability to estimate the time of onset of widespread fatigue dam- age that could degrade the damage tolerance capability of aircraft. 148</page><page sequence="148">941231-941247 It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the USAF aging aircraft pro- gram and its associated efforts. 941232. Considerations in the service life extension program for the C-141 aircraft. John W. Lincoln , United States Air Force. The C-141 aircraft have had a long and useful life in the inven- tory of the United States Air Force. The issues associated with the extension of the life of this aircraft is typical of the problems faced in the extension of the life of any aircraft. One of the main issues is the corrosion damage in the aircraft. Another of the main issues is widespread fatigue damage. The presence of either of these prob- lems could be life limiting or, at least, incur a significant economic impact to correct the problem. It is the purpose of this paper to examine the life extension issues related to structural integrity for the C-141 aircraft. 941233. (SP- 1047) Engine design for mechanics. Frank C. Gil- lette, Jr., Pratt &amp; Whitney. This paper addresses a new gas turbine engine design approach that greatly improves the supportability of tomorrow's weapon sys- tem. This approach raises the level of availability and readiness of the weapon system to counter any emerging threat. The key ele- ments of this approach are the Integrated Product Development (IPD) process, designer awareness, supportability reviews, compre- hensive trade studies, early support tool involvement and full-scale mockups. This paper concludes with a discussion of how this new design approach benefits the weapon system and the user. 941240. Selective strippability. Roger Blackford, Courtaulds Aerospace. The concept of having an intermediate coat between the primer and topcoat in an airliner exterior paint scheme has enabled the selective removal of the topcoat by chemical stripping leaving the primer unaffected. This principle has opened up the possibility for chemical strip- ping of a paint scheme using less aggressive, more environmentally friendly chemical strippers and the possibility of being able to chem- ically strip paint from composite parts. The theory and historical development of this concept is explained, including comparative stripping results with different strippers and different paint systems leading to further future devel- opments. 941242. Dry media paint stripping - Nine years later. Robert Pauli, Pauli and Griffin Co. Many topics are covered in this discussion of the ninth year since production dry stripping began in May 1985. Chemical strippers continue to be heavily regulated or banned. All other alternate coating removal processes are still in develop- mental stages, have not shown viability for production use and have not been accepted by maintenance operations or received manufac- turer approvals. Dry media stripping continues to expand and to pro- duce a very successful record-particularly wheat starch media. In a no technical objection letter dated April 30, 1993, America West Airlines, Phoenix, Arizona, received authorization for five time stripping of Boeing airframes utilizing wheat starch media. Additional approvals for graphite-epoxy and fiberglass compos- ite dry paint stripping were recently published by Boeing. Hill Air Force Base, Utah, generates zero hazardous waste from its dry stripping operation. Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, corrosion control facility, the larg- est dry stripping facility in the world, was completed in July 1992, and is successfully stripping C-5 airframes on a production basis. US Navy Aviation Depot, Pensacola, Florida, continues its suc- cessful dry stripping program, stripping over one hundred aircraft the pst year with Type V media. Sealant and residue from rotor blades were successfully removed utilizing wheat starch media. 941243. Paint stripping with non-toxic chemicals. Harvey B. Hans, McGean-Rohco, Inc. A number of products that do not contain chlorinated solvents or phenol have been developed to remove paint from aircraft. These products are now being used successfully to strip commercial and military aircraft. Acid activated, as well as near neutral pH and alka- line activated products, are available. These products usually take longer to remove the paint. However, they have demonstrated the ability to efficiently remove the paint without extending the total time required to process the aircraft. These new products greatly reduce exposure of workers and the environment to hazardous chemicals. This paper will present data on relative strip rates and environ- mental impact. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941244. Dry media stripping with wheat starch. Ralph Lott, Beech Aircraft Co. The aerospace industry will see major changes in coatings and coating removal technology as a result of environmental and air pol- lution regulations being presently drafted. We can expect continu- ous change until hazardous materials are minimized and pollution is eliminated. In the field of paint removal, dry media stripping with wheat starch has the versatility to meet this challenge. 941246. An alternative heat blanket - "Thermal diffusing apparatus". James R. Bopp and David A. Pimentel, Boeing Defense &amp; Space Group. This paper describes the evolution of the Thermal Diffusing Apparatus (TDA) (patent pending) and elaborates on the specific problems in bonded repair of complex composite structures. The use of composite materials in current and future aircraft presents both factory and field-level technicians with unique repair problems. Pre- cise temperature control over the entire repair area is required if damaged composite aircraft structures are to be restored to mission- ready status. The TDA uniformly heats thermally complex compo- nents and is a direct replacement for conventional heat blankets, resulting in significant improvements in the repair process and better control of variations in cure temperature. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941247. Advanced analysis methods and nondestructive inspection technology under development in the NASA airframe structural integrity program. Charles, E. Harris, James H. Starnes, Jr., and Joseph Heyman, NASA. An advanced analytical methodology has been developed for predicting the residual strength of stiffened thin-sheet riveted shell structures such as those used for the fuselage of a commercial trans- port aircraft. The crack-tip opening angle elastic-plastic fracture cri- terion has been coupled to a geometric and material nonlinear finite element shell code for analyzing complex structural behavior. An automated adaptive mesh refinement capability together with glob- al-local analysis methods have been developed to predict the behav- ior of fuselage structure with long cracks. This methodology is cur- rently being experimentally verified. Advanced nondestructive inspection technology has been devel- oped that will provide airline operators with the capability to con- duct reliable and economical broad-area inspections of aircraft structures. Standard methods based on ultrasonics, thermal diffu- sivity, radiography, coherent optics, and electromagnetics have been modified for airframe geometries and aircraft inspection environ- ments to detect disbonds at tear straps and lap splices, fatigue cracks at rivets, and corrosion throughout the airframe structure. Advanced signal processing methods have been combined with computational models to provide a quantitative engineering record of the damage in the structure. These methods are currently being demonstrated in the field. Laboratory methods are also being developed to character- ize defects in materials and strain and displacement fields in struc- tures. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 149</page><page sequence="149">941248-941258 941248. Research into alternative aircraft paint stripping methods. Mark Muller , Galaxy Scientific Corp.; and John W. Rein- hardt, Federal Aviation Administration. This paper documents research sponsored by the Federal Avia- tion Administration (FAA) to investigate the effects of alternative paint removal methods on aircraft structure. Industry data and speci- fications were identified that describe the effects and proper use of plastic media blasting (PMB) on aircraft structures. A supplemental test program provided data on the specific substrate materials of interest to the FAA, anodized and alelad 2024-T3 aluminum in 0.032, 0.040, and 0.050- inch thicknesses. A technology survey of alternative paint removal methods was conducted, examining paint removal effectiveness, effect on the substrate, environmental impact, worker safety, and cost. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941250. A comparison of Russian and American oxygen gen- eration hardware. Ronald J. Davenport, Franz H. Schubert, Robert B. Boyda, and Bei-jiann Chang, Life Systems, Inc. Cooperation between Russia and the United States on manned spaceflight has led to unprecedented openness, resulting in the abil- ity to now compare the characteristics of environmental control/life support hardware selected to generate oxygen (O2) by water elec- trolysis for space station applications. This comparison in this paper focuses on the characteristics that have the greatest effect on the cost of assembling and maintaining the hardware in space: launch weight, volume, power consumption, resupply requirements and maintenance labor. 941251. A description and comparison of U.S. and Russian urine processing hardware for the international space station. Cindy F. Hutchens, NASA. The Russian space program has maintained crews on long dura- tion space flights nearly continuously over the past two decades. As a result, a strong emphasis has been placed on the development of regenerative life support systems. One of these systems is a urine processor which has been operating on-orbit since 1990. The U.S. has also been developing urine processing systems to reclaim water from urine over the past twenty years. This paper will describe the two different technologies used for urine processing for long-term human presence in space and will compare the operating character- istics of the two systems. 941252. Testing of Russian ECLSS - Sabatier and potable water processor. Donald Rethke, Philip Birbara, Norman Gra- bowski, Patricia O 'Donnell, and John Steele, Hamilton Standard Space Systems International, Inc.; and Leonid Bobe, and Lev Gavrilov, NIICHIMMASH. Hamilton Standard Space Systems International, Inc. (HSSSI) has obtained and is currently testing a variety of Russian life support hardware. These units have been or are contemplated for use on Mir I and II space stations. This paper presents the current status of performance testing of a Sabatier Carbon Dioxide Processing Unit (CDPU) and compo- nents of a Potable Water Processing System (PWP). These systems were fabricated by NIICHIMMASH, the supplier of these units to the Russian space program. It is the intent of this testing program to obtain a data base for technology comparisons to support planned and future international missions. For the CDPU, reactant conversion efficiencies in excess of 99 percent have been noted for the variation in test conditions with 2 to 6 man processing (flows) tested. The CDPU' s effluent water has been produced at anticipated rates and is relatively contaminant free. Additionally, the CDPU' s separator and pump assembly has per- formed in an efficient manner. A description of the Russian PWP systemis provided. Details of PWP test program with challenge solutions simulating the humidity condensate on the Mir space station are noted. A discussion of NIICHIMMASH water reclamation processing approach and hard- ware is addressed.

Debris and particulate filtration problems have been persistent during flights on the Space Shuttle Orbiter since STS- 6. Analysis of the Orbiter Environmental and Life Support System (ECLSS) indicated that both the volumetric flows and velocities were essen- tially designed for ventilation, heat removal, and gas blending with minimal consideration for debris removal. The baseline Orbiter fil- tration system consisted of a single 300 micron filter at the inlet of the cabin fan primarily to protect the cabin fan hardware. This filter was increased to 70 microns and additional filters added after some hardware failures occurred. However, these changes did not clean the environment as expected. An evaluation of the size and type of debris in the cabin air determined that the debris is able to "short- circuit" the cabin filtration system and remains in the cabin air caus- ing the crew discomfort. To correct this situation, a portable fan and filter assembly (Cabin Air Cleaner) was developed to assist in the cleaning and evaluated during the STS-40 Shuttle mission. The crew observed during the flight that the amount of debris in the air was noticeably reduced as compared with previous flight experiences. The Cabin Air Cleaner (CAC) is routinely being flown on all Shuttle missions exceeding 49 crew days. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941254. Glow discharge techniques for the production and acquisition of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. Dongchuan Wu and Robert L. Ash, Old Dominion Univ.; and R. A. Outlaw, NASA. A glow-discharge can be sustained in ambient Mars atmosphere, resulting in the dissociation of carbon dioxide molecules into carbon monoxide and oxygen. If the glow-discharge zone is maintained adjacent to a silver permeation membrane, atomic oxygen, produced by the discharge, can be separated from the other species. Experi- ments have been conducted to determine the behavior of glow- discharge enhanced oxygen production over a range of temperatures at Mars ambient pressure, in order to assess this approach as a possi- ble low-temperature alternative to mechanical filtration, collection, compression and heating of Mars atmosphere with subsequent elec- trochemical separation. 941256. Using Martian resources for life support. Christopher P. McKay, NASA. Designs for future exploration of Mars that include the use of resources obtained on the Martian surface can greatly expand the range of exploration compared with those that reply on material car- ried from Earth. In addition, the use of in situ resources provides a step in the direction of a self-sufficient settlement. The key resources are: O2, H2O and buffer gas (either N2 or N2/Ar). Promis- ing laboratory scale prototypes are already under development and the production of oxygen may be practical even on near-term robotic missions. Preliminary calculations suggest that water will be diffi- cult to produce on Mars. This detriment is partially offset by the ease of storage of water. Buffer gas is a requirement for a breathable gas mixture and either N2 or N2/Ar gases can be produced from the mar- tian atmosphere. Two important criteria forjudging systems for the production of resource on Mars are: 1 ) the mass gain factor, which is the total mass of resource produced by the system divided by the mass of the system, and 2) the specific energy required to produce a unit mass of the resource. To be practical the mass gain must be 100 or more and the specific energy must be less than about 10 kW- hr/kg. 941258. Consideration for the utilization of in-situ resources for life support systems on the Moon. Michael B. Duke, NASA. 150</page><page sequence="150">941258-941263 Materials from the Moon can play a major role in life support systems designed for operation on the lunar surface. Uses include oxygen and nitrogen for atmospheric makeup, hydrogen (and water), carbon and, potentially, minor and trace elements for the food chain, and construction materials for the extension of habitable and work volumes. The basic consideration that must be met is that the mass of the extraction and production system required to pro- duce a particular material must be less than the total amount of the material to be produced by the system over its operational lifetime. Once that criterion has been met, improvements may be found in a systems integration of the many areas in which the indigenous resources might be utilized. 941259. Modeling the sweat regulation mechanism. Anthony B. Cambell, Satish S. Nair, and John B. Miles, University of Mis- souri; and Bruce W. Webbon, NASA. Modeling the sweat regulation mechanism is important for reli- able simulation of the human thermoregulatory processes. The com- plexity of the mechanism makes it very difficult to model using tra- ditional techniques. An engineering or systems overview of the human thermoregulatory system is reported. An extensive review of previous attempts to model the human sweat rate forms an important part of this paper. In addition, this study investigates the applicability of neural net- works to the problem of modeling the complex non- linearities of the sweat regulatory mechanism. It is believed that neural networks provide better generalization capabilities for all the cited dependen- cies resulting in better sweat prediction models. The network is thus in a position to generalize based on the different operating condi- tions and provide more reliable outputs over an entire range of envi- ronments and metabolic profiles. Results of a neural network sweat rate model for a sedentary human exposed to step changes in envi- ronmental temperature are reported. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941260. Investigation of space flight effects on Escherichia coli growth. David M. Klaus, Marvin W. Luttges, and Louis S. Stod- ieck, University of Colorado. It is hypothesized that the weightless environment experienced during space flight has a stimulating effect on the growth rate of microorganisms. This theory was tested with the bacterium Escherichia coli using protocols and supporting hardware evolved over five space shuttle missions between April, 1991 and July, 1993. In comparing 38 bacterial growth experiments across multiple flights, the overall average population density of E. coli achieved in space was 88% greater than that of matched ground controls (N=19 flight, 19 ground, p&lt;0.05). Depending on test variables, growth increases in space of up to 257% over ground controls were observed. Analysis of bacterial proteins by gel electrophoresis indi- cated an apparent difference in expressed protein between flight and ground control E. coli samples in the range of 20-30 kD. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941261. Immersion, hyperoxia, hypercapnia: additive effect upon pulmonary function. . A. Tikhonov, V. M. Baranov, and A. N. Kotov, Institute for Biomedical Problems. In a study of 6 men aged 29 to 48 we studied the effect of water body immersion during air or pure oxygen, or oxygen - 4% CO2 gas mixture breathing upon pulmonary volumes and respiratory biome- chanics (using bodyplethysmography), the extent of lung hydration (two-frequency impedansometry), and pulmonary metabolic func- tion (by determination of the concentration of biologically active substances in the condensate of the exhaled air). We found an addi- tive nature of immersion/hyperoxic effects upon the respiratory and metabolic pulmonary functions manifested in an acceleration and growth of a deficit in pulmonary vital capacity, a bronchoconstric- tion effect, increase of a lung hydration, and decrease of serotonin catabolism. Contrary to our expectation, we did not find any potenti- ation of oxygen induced toxic effects upon the lungs during immer- sion/hyperoxia/ hypercapnia exposures. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941262. Manned missions to Mars: human-related aspects. Maria Antonietta Perino, Fabiana Bobba, and Francesco Bruneiii, Alenia Spazio S. p. A. In the overall planning of a manned mission to Mars, all the issues related to human involvement are critical. To a certain extent, they dictate the most severe constraints on the mission scenario and spacecraft architecture. Despite this unanimously recognized importance, limited efforts have been devoted up to now to dedicated research activities on human-related aspects, partially neglected w.r.t more technical areas like orbital dynamics, propulsion, power generation, etc. This paper summarizes the major results of a survey on the human factors of long duration missions performed by Alenia Spazio in the frame of an ESA study, MARSEMSI, whose aim was to identify possible scenarios and related infrastructure requirements for a manned mission to Mars. The many relevant topics addressed to obtain a global under- standing of this field have been organized in three main groups: • Physiopathological aspects, involving crew health and perfor- mance, specifically analyzed in a Mars manned mission on the crew well-being perspective. The effects of the space natural environ- ments on the crew well-being as well as those due to the spacecraft and mission operation environments are considered here. Specific aspects of Health Maintenance are addressed as they might occur during such a long-duration mission. • Human interaction related aspects, including the complex of psychological problems arising from crew interaction during the mission in the frame of their artificial society. An effective crew selection and training process and a suitable crew support during the mission are regarded as fundamental factors for the overall mission success. • Man-system integration aspects have also to be carefully con- sidered from the very beginning of the Mars mission planning, as the mutual interrelationship between man and machine is critical for mission safety and success. Issues such as habitability, life support, man-machine integration and task sharing optimization are exam- ined. Finally, considerations regarding the criticality of all the identi- fied aspects are presented, with the aim of highlighting those requir- ing a more in-depth research effort in the years to come, and with the clear baseline that the complex network of links between man, system and environment is the variable to be optimized. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941263. Chemical sensor testing for space life support chemi- cal processing: Part 1. Moisture sensors. Darrell L. Jan, Gerald Voecks, and Naresh Rohatgi, California Institute of Technology. In support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a laboratory has been established at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to evaluate the characteristics of chemical sensors which are candidates for use in a controlled chemical processing life support system. Such a facility is required for characterizing those sensors under development as well as those commercially available but whose functional properties are typically based upon operating in industrial environments that will not be completely synonymous with space operations. Space environments, such as on orbiting sta- tion or lunar base, will generally have different sensor requirements than terrestrial applications with respect to size, multi-functionality, sensitivity, reliability, temperature, ruggedness, mass, consumables, life, and power requirements. Both commercially available and developmental moisture sen- sors have been evaluated. These sensors have been evaluated under conditions which simulate the process stream environment of a four bed, molecular sieve, carbon dioxide removal operation. Selected sensors were also tested in an environment simulating an Advanced Carbon Formation System. Sensor technologies include electro- 151</page><page sequence="151">941263-941270 chemical (both conductometric and capacitive) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) types. Parameters of interest over repeated cyclic life testing included particular conditions of flowrate and temperature. A computer-controlled data acquisition and control system allows programmable and repeatable cycles operating over the specific moisture-time profile measured from air processing operations. Test results are presented for various commercially available moisture sensors. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941264. Development of new sensors for biological life sup- port systems. David A. Barrow, University of Wales; and Joseph J. Cef ai, MSTB, Ltd . The sensor requirements for monitoring liquid phase parameters in Bioregenerative-Life-Support-Systems (BLSSs) for space appli- cation are reviewed. The requirement to measure many parameters over long time periods and at different nodes of Closed Ecological Systems, was determined. The demanding operational characteris- tics required of sensors for BLSS application were found to be very difficult to achieve with even state-of-the-art advanced chemical sensors, particularly biosensors. Flow-Injection-Analysis (FIA) was considered to represent the most appropriate interface technology for near-term application of these sensors. The recent emergence of Microsystems Technologies, and particularly Integrated Chemical Analysis Microsystems, are proposed as the means by which FIA, chemosensors and biosensors can be interfaced with space BLSSs in a flexible, modular land miniaturized format. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941265. ECLSS trace gas monitoring: Breadboarding of an FTIR Michelson Interferometer. Hermann Bittner and Markus Erhard, Kayser-Threde GmbH; Tonje Midtgaard, SINTEF Instru- mentering; Katja David, Dornier GmbH; and Gijsbert Tan, ESA/ ESTEC. In an earlier assessment of trace gas monitoring techniques it was shown that Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is the most promising technology for multi-component gas analysis of the breathing air for long duration crewed space missions. It has the potential of meeting all the requirements established for the different trace gas monitoring scenarios; however, it needs further develop- ment. An important step to achieve this development objective is the breadboarding of such an FTIR system with particular emphasis on the critical technologies. The critical technologies as identified so far are the detector and cooler, the gas cell, the infrared source, and the analysis software. In this paper we will present and discuss the relevant require- ments, the planned instrumental and software concept to be realized for meeting the intended monitoring task, and the expected perfor- mance data of the breadboard. The work is being performed under ESA contract. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941266. An electronic nose for measuring airborne organic compounds. Julian W. Gardner, University of Warwick ; Philip N. Bartlett, University of Southampton; and Wolfgang Göpel, Univer- sity of Tübingen. The next decade should see the arrival of a new breed of analyti- cal instruments capable of measuring complex mixtures of gases or vapours in air. Current research instruments comprise an array of solid state chemical sensors and an appropriate pattern analyser to identify unknown mixtures. Such instruments can be used in two application areas: first to sample complex odours thereby creating an "electronic nose" and secondly to sample volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) thereby creating a chemical sensorie array device (ChemSAD). This paper describes some novel instrumentation being developed to analyse complex odours, and presents results on the analysis of malodours and organic vapous in air. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941267. Solid state oxygen sensor development. Jeffery T. Cheung, Rockwell Science Center; and Scott R. Johnson, Rockwell Aerospace. To anticipate future long-duration mission needs for life support sensors, we explored the feasibility of using thin-film metal-oxide semiconductors. The objective of this task was to develop gas sen- sors for life support applications which would be suitable for long- duration missions. Metal oxides, such as ZnO, SnC&gt;2, and TÌO2 have been shown to react with oxygen molecules. Oxygen lowers the metal oxide's electrical resistance. Critical to the performance is the application of the oxide in a thin film on an inert substrate: the thin- ner the film, the more readily the oxygen penetration and hence the more rapid and sensitive the sensor. Metal oxides are not limited to oxygen detection, rather, oxides offer detection and quantification applications to the complete range of gases of interest, not only for life support systems, but for propellants as well. After a preliminary assessment of various metal oxides, we chose ZnO as the active sensory element for oxygen - the most critical near-term need for life support sensors. Our results to date are that we: a. Verified that metal oxides respond linearly to oxygen concen- tration; b. Experimented with deposition techniques for a thin film of ZnO; c. Determined the appropriate operational parameters by which ZnO could be used to measure oxygen in concentrations from 10% to 30%; d. Selected a conceptual design suitable for proof of concept; and e. Developed techniques to fabricate the prototype sen- sor compatible with integrated circuit and microelectronic packag- ing Subsequent work will optimize the ZnO properties, refine proto- type design and fabrication, and install and test the sensors in the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Plant Growth Chamber. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941268. The Variable Radioisotope Heater Unit for the Cas- sini spacecraft. Jacqueline C. Lyra and James W. Stultz, California Institute of Technology. This paper describes the Variable Radioisotope Heater Unit its development, performance, and effectiveness at controlling the tem- peratures for the Cassini spacecraft thruster clusters. To explore the Saturn system, the Cassini spacecraft relies on the electrical power from three Radioisotope Thermoelectric Genera- tors, but the large power demand for science and engineering func- tions severely limits the electrical power available for temperature control purposes. The Variable Radioisotope Heater Unit combines the heating- and temperature- control functions into one non- electrical self-controlled unit, thereby freeing up electrical heater power for other uses on the spacecraft. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941269. Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator waste heat system for the Cassini propulsion module. Virgil Míreles and James W. Stultz , California Institute of Technology. This paper describes the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) waste heat system and its development, performance, and effectiveness at controlling the temperatures for the propulsion module for the Cassini space craft. To explore the Saturn system, the Cassini spacecraft relies on the electrical power from these RTGs, but the large power demand for science and engineering functions severely limits the electrical power available for temperature control. The waste heat system transfers heat radiatively and conductively from each RTG to the propulsion module to maintain temperatures and establish a stable temperature sink to which the rest of the orbiter is thermally anchored. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941270. Performance of a flat plate solar collector in extra- terrestrial environments. Nik Djordjevich, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. 152</page><page sequence="152">941270-941275 The thermal performance of a double glazed, flat plate, water heating solar collector in two extraterrestrial environments has been calculated. Incident Solar and Earth-emitted radiation data for a ref- erence cube in Earth orbit was used to predict thermal performance of the collector in three Low Earth Orbit configurations. The sun facing surface of a sun-oriented spacecraft maintains positive ther- mal efficiencies over a 90 minute orbit (including the night side). Outlet water temperatures as high as 121 °C are achievable. Both fixed (facing up) and sun-tracking collectors on the Lunar equator exhibit efficiencies over 90%. Maximum outlet water temperatures of over 177°C are achievable. It is concluded that flat plate collec- tors are suitable for a solar water system for space heating of manned habitats where waste heat is unavailable. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941271. Evaluation of a reverse Brayton cycle heat pump for lunar base cooling. K. R. Sridhar, Ashok Nanjundan, and Matthias Gottmann , University of Arizona; and Theodore D. Swanson , and Jeffrey Didion, NASA. This paper explores the possibilities of cooling a permanently inhabited lunar base with a reverse Brayton cycle Thermal Control System (TCS). Based on an initial stage outpost, the cooling needs are defined. A thermodynamic performance model for the Brayton cycle is derived using ideal gas analysis. This model includes ineffi- ciencies and irreversibilities of the components. The free parameters in the thermodynamic model are successively removed using limit- ing values for efficiencies and determining operating parameters by sub-optimizations. In essence a model for cooling efficiency as a function of rejection temperature alone is obtained. For every com- ponent of the system a mass model is applied and the overall mass is determined. The last remaining degree of freedom, the rejection temperature, is eliminated by an optimization for lowest overall mass. The result for minimal TCS mass is compared to a reference TCS using a Rankine cycle. It is found that the Brayton cycle is not competitive with the Rankine TCS. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941272. High temperature lift heat pump refrigerant and thermodynamic cycle selection. Jeffrey H. Goldman and Thomas Lovell, Forest-Miller , Inc. ; and Michael K. Ewert and Patricia A. Petete, NASA. This paper describes the process and analysis used to select a refrigerant and thermodynamic cycle as the basis of a vapor com- pression heat pump requiring a high temperature lift. Use of a vapor compression heat pump versus other types was based on prior work performed for the Electric Power Research Institute. A high lift heat pump is needed to enable a thermal control system to remove heat down to 275K from a habitable volume when the external thermal environment is severe. For example, a long term habitat will reject heat from a space radiator to a 325K environment. The first step in the selection process was to perform an optimization trade study, quantifying the effect of radiator operating temperature and heat pump efficiency on total system mass; then, select the radiator oper- ating temperature corresponding to the lowest system mass. Total system mass included radiators, all heat pump components and the power supply system. The study showed that night operation, with no temperature lift, dictated the radiator size. To operate otherwise would require a high mass penalty to store power. With the defined radiation surface, and heat pump performances assumed to be from 40 percent to 60 percent of the Carnot ideal, the optimum heat rejec- tion temperature ranged from 387K to 377K, as a function of heat pump performance. Refrigerant and thermodynamic cycles were then selected to best meet the previously determined design conditions. The system was then adapted as a ground-based prototype lifting temperature of 360K (versus 385K for flight unit) and using readily available com- mercial-grade components. Over 40 refrigerants, separated into wet and dry compression behavioral types, were considered in the selec- tion process. Refrigerants were initially screened for acceptable crit- ical temperature. The acceptable refrigerants were analyzed in ideal single and two- stage thermodynamic cycles. Top candidates were analyzed assuming realistic component limits and system pressure drops, and were evaluated for other considerations such as safety, environmental impact and commercial availability. A maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of 56 percent of the Carnot ideal was achievable for a three-stage CFC- 11 cycle operating under the flight conditions above. However, the final selection was driven by a requirement to use a non-CFC refrigerant in the ground-based prototype and the desire to maintain a consistent refrigerant in both flight and prototype systems. Therefore, HCFC- 123 was the chosen refrigerant with an expected COP of 43 percent of the Carnot ideal for the ground- based prototype. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941273. Cryogenic activities in the ESA technology research program - Past, present and future. Chris Jewell, ESTEC. Since 1975, ESA' s TRP activities in the cryogenic domain have been steadily increasing. Before 1986 most of these activities were directed towards the development of cryogen technology. CRHE- SUS (Cryostat a Helium Superfluide pour Utilisatin Spatiale) was a program which helped develop superfluid helium technology within Europe. Since 1986 however, a major step forward has been made in cryocooler technology, with an 80K cooler developed under TRP funding being recognized as the first viable space cryocooler. It is presently being sold by BAe (UK) as a commercial product. While keeping the basic design these cryocoolers are continuing to be developed down to lower temperatures. Coolers at 20K, 4K and 2.5K exist with 0.1K foreseen. Other cryogenic activities are dis- cussed in the paper and the overall logic and direction of ESA' s cryogenic TRP developments explained. 941274. The design and testing of the ISO-payload module. Th. Paßvogel, A. Seidel, E. Wilz, and U. Sagner, Deutsche Aero- space. The ISO-satellite consists of a Service and a Payload Module (PLM), the latter being essentially made of the Cryostat. The paper describes essentially the hardware status of the PLM-flight model as it is delivered for final satellite integration and acceptance testing before flight. The various test activities and essential results obtained during development, qualification and PLM-flight model acceptance up to delivery to ESTEC are summarized. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941275. Development of a cryogenic laboratory for the test- ing of the ISO optical subsystem. A. Cucchiaro, D. Derauw, I. Domken, M. Henrist, P. Jamotton, N. Ninane, M. Thomé, and I. Tychon, Centre Spatial de Liège ; and R. Blanpain, University of Liège. Since the beginning of 1988, the Focal 5 facility of CSL (Centre Spatial de Liège) has been upgraded in order to perform the cryo- genic optical tests of the single optical components as well as the overall telescope assembly of the optical subsystem of the ESA ISO telescope. The main objectives of these vacuum thermal tests were: 1. to measure the optical surface quality of the various components and of the fully assembled telescope (WFE measurement at cryogenic temperatures (5k); and 2. to measure the misalignment of the tele- scope and its associated experiments when in cryogenic conditions (5k). Consequently, a special experimental set-up has been designed and manufactured in order to reach these objectives taking into account that: 1. Alignment between the different optical elements had to be kept during the cryo-test inside given ranges (+/- 15 arc- min) from 300k to 5k; 2. The cool down and the warm-up phases of the specimens had not to induce excessive constrains in the mate- rials; 3. The measurements were achieved through interferometrie methods which required high stability; and 4. Special care had to be taken for the thermal control, thermal monitoring and thermal mea- surements. 153</page><page sequence="153">941276-941282 941276. A long life refrigerator for O.IK cooling in space. A. Benoit, Centre de Recherches sur les Très Basses Températures; T. Bradshaw, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory; C. Jewell, European Space Research and Technology Center; T. Maciaszek , Centre National d'Etudes spatiales; A. Orłowska, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory; and S. Pujol, Institut Laue Langevin. Cooling detectors down to O.IK will be of great importance for future far infrared and submillimeter space telescopes during the next few years. This objective can be reached using a Stirling Cryo- cooler and a Joule Thomson (JT) expansion stage to pre-cool to 4K. The low temperatures are then obtained by an open cycle dilution refrigerator circulating 3He and 4He. This system does not need any cryogenic reservoir and can be launched at room temperature. In this paper, we present the characteristics and performances of the two parts of the refrigerator measured separately, showing the feasibility of such a system. Expected performances of the complete system are a base temperature of lOOmK with lOOnW heat load and a life time of 5 years with a reasonable gas storage weight (20-50 kg). 941277. Self-contained 3He Refrigerator for long term space applications - Present Status. Gérard Rouillé and Christopher Jewell, ESA/ESTEC Over the past 5 years ESTEC has funded work at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and BAe concerning the development of very low temperature (4K and 2.5K) cryocoolers with operational life- times in excess of 3 years. Therefore it was natural when taking into account the advantages of a closed cycle 3He refrigerator and the ESA 2.5K cryocooler that the idea of incorporating them into a 0.3K cryocooler should arise. In-house work at ESTEC started in 1992 with the goal of eventually obtaining a space qualified 3He refriger- ator/2. 5 K cryocooler for long term operation, free of cryogen replenishment, which should weight less than 40Kg and require less than 1 10W of power input. Two 3He refrigerators have been manu- factured, which are still being tested. In this paper we will present the design of those 3He refrigerators. The experimental results on the thermal/mechanical behavior of the refrigerator, using a liquid 4He bath cryostat as the pre-cooling stage, will be presented at the conference. 941278. A thermal switch for use at 0.3K in space born cryo- genic systems. Lionel Duband and Alain Ravex, CEAJDRFMC/SBT. A gas gap heat switch has been developed for use in space borne cryogenic systems. The switch is simple, small and lightweight. Due to the absence of moving parts lifetime and reliability are expected to be very high. Four switches have been manufactured and thermal and vibration tests have been successfully carried out. The lowest resonant fre- quency is 380 Hz and the switches underwent a random vibration up to 1 1 G in all directions from 30 to 2000 Hz, and a constant accel- eration test at 15 G between 15 and 100 Hz. As an example an "on" thermal conductance at 4K of approxi- mately 35 mW.K"1 was measured and the on to off ratio was found to be of the order of 2700. The switching temperature is around 15K. 941279. Adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators for space applications. /. D. Hepburn, A. Smith, and I. Davenport, Mullard Space Science Laboratory. We show that the space prohibitive laboratory adiabatic demag- netization refrigerator properties of high magnetic field and a &lt;2K environment (provided by a bath of liquid He4) can be alleviated, without a significant decrease in operational efficiency, through the use of a 2 or 3 salt pill refrigerator rather then the classical single salt pill design. The additional salt pills providing intermediate cool- ing stages, enabling operations from a 4K environment which can be provided by a single mechanical cooler. For such ADRs the minimum magnetic field required is 2 and 1 Tesla for the 2 and 3 salt pill cases respectively. Such low mag- netic fields allow the possible use of permanent and high tempera- ture mechanically cooled superconducting magnets, avoiding the danger of quenching of the superconducting magnet. We conclude that such ADRs offer a long orbital life time, high efficiency means of sub Kelvin cooling. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941280. Development status of a 2.5K - 4K closed cycle cooler suitable for space use. T. W. Bradshaw, A. Orłowska, and J. Hieatt, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Temperatures below 2.5K have been reached in a continuously operating closed cycle cooler that has been engineered for space applications. This cooler is a modification of a 4 K development model cryocooler that consists of a two-stage Stirling cycle pre- cooler with a closed cycle Joule-Thomson (JT) stage. The Stirling cycle precooler and the compressors for the JT system incorporate all the long life features of the Oxford/RAL single stage coolers which are now in orbit and operating successfully. The precooler now incorporates larger pistons and a slightly modified regenerator; this has led to a lower precooler temperature and increased JT cool- ing power. A new heat exchanger between the lower and upper stages of the precooler has reduced the heat load on the precooler. He is used in the JT system for temperatures around 4 K and 3He is used below 3 K. Different JT expansion orifices are used to opti- mize the cooler at 4 K and 2.5 K. These give flow rates of about 3 mg/s and 1 mg/s respectively. For operation at the lower tempera- tures the reduced flow enables a lower pressure (and hence tempera- ture) to be maintained on the low pressure side of the expansion ori- fice. Under no-load conditions and with no gas in the JT system the precooler reaches a base temperature of 11.3 K. Using 4He the JT system achieved 4 K with a 10 mW heat load. With the smaller ori- fice and using 3He a temperature of 2.46 K was achieved with a heat load (at base temperature) of over 3 mW. The input power to the cooler was approximately 126 W. The temperature stability of the system at 4 K was better than 50 mK over a 4.5 hour period. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941281. Kennedy Space Center processing of life science pay- loads. Michael E. Haddad, NASA Kennedy Space Center. There are many steps involved in preparing a payload for a mis- sion into space on the space shuttle. Operations at the John F. Ken- nedy Space Center (KSC) are the last of those steps for the hardware before the payload is launched. To demonstrate those operations that deal with life science payloads, this paper will discuss KSC process- ing of the space transportation system (STS) -58 spacelab life sci- ences-2 (SLS-2) mission which was launched on the space shuttle Columbia, October 18, 1993 and landed at Edward's Air Force Base (EAFB) on November 1, 1993. 941282. Humidity and temperature control in the Astrocul- ture™ flight experiment. Neil A. Duffie, Raymond J. Bula, Robert C. Morrow, Paul E. Quirin, Philip D. Macaulay, Steven R. Wranovsky, and John C. Vignale, University of Wisconsin; and The- odore W. Tibbits, Univeristy of Wisconsin. The ASTROCULTURE™ (ASC) middeck flight experiment series was developed to test subsystems required to grow plants in reduced gravity, with the goal of developing a plant growth unit suit- able for conducting quality biological research in microgravity. Pre- vious Space Shuttle flights (STS-50 and STS-57) have successfully demonstrated the ability to control water movement through a par- ticulate rooting matrix in microgravity and the ability of LED light- ing systems to provide high levels of irradiance without excessive heat build-up in microgravity. The humidity and temperature control system used in the mid- deck flight unit is described in this paper. The system controls air flow and provides dehumidification, humidification, and condensate recovery for a plant growth chamber volume of 1450 cm3.

However, in this prototype unit, control is limited to the range of 24°C to 35°C.

Development of an Inflight Refill Unit for replenish- ing research animal drinking water. P. D. Savage and M. L. Hines, NASA; and R. Barnes, Lockheed Engineering and Sciences Co. The Spacelab Life Sciences 2 (SLS-2) mission became NASA's longest duration Shuttle mission, lasting fourteen days, when Columbia landed on November 1, 1993. Located within the Spa- celab were a total of 48 laboratory rats which were housed in two Research Animal Holding Facilities (RAHFs) developed by the Space Life Sciences Payloads Office (SLSPO) at Ames Research Center. In order to properly maintain the health and well-being of these important research animals, sufficient quantities of food and water had to be available for the duration of the mission. An Inflight Refill Unit was developed by the SLSPO to replenish the animals' drinking water inflight using the Shuttle potable water system in the middeck galley as the source of additional water. The Inflight Refill Unit consists of two major subsystems, a Fluid Pumping Unit (FPU) and a Collapsible Water Reservoir (CWR). The FPU provides the system measurement and controls, pump, water lines, and plumbing necessary to collect water coming into the unit from the potable water system and pump it out and into the RAHF drinking water tanks. The CWR is a Kevlar™ reinforced storage bladder, connected to the FPU, which has a capacity of 6 liters in its expanded volume and functions to store the water col- lected from the potable water system and allows for the transport of the water back to the Spacelab where it is pumped into each of two RAHFs. Additional components of the IRU system include the inlet and outlet fluid hoses, a power cable for providing 28 volt direct current spacecraft electrical power to the pump within the FPU, a tether system for the unit when in use in Spacelab, and an adapter for mating the unit to the orbiter waste collection system in order to dump excess water after use in Spacelab. This paper will present the design process and development approach for the Inflight Refill Unit, define some of the key design issues which had to be addressed, and summarize the inflight opera- tional performance of the unit during the SLS-2 mission. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941284.

A chemical containment model for the General Pur- pose Work Station. Gregory K. Schmidt, NASA; and Alexis A. Flip- pen, University of Southern Colorado. Contamination control is a critical safety requirement imposed on experiments flying on board the Spacelab. The General Purpose Work Station, a Spacelab support facility used for life sciences space flight experiments, is designed to remove volatile compounds from its internal airpath and thereby minimize contamination of the Spacelab. This is accomplished through the use of a large, multi- stage filter known as the Trace Contaminant Control System. Many experiments planned for the Spacelab require the use of toxic, vola- tile fixatives in order to preserve specimens prior to post-flight anal- ysis. The NASA-Ames Research Center SLS-2 payload, in particu- lar, necessitated the use of several toxic, volatile compounds in order to accomplish the many inflight experiment objectives of this mission. A model was developed based on earlier theories and cal- culations which provides conservative predictions of the resultant concentrations of these compounds given various spill scenarios. This paper describes the development and application of this model. 941287. Microgravity flight - Accommodating non-human primates. Bonnie P. Dalton and Nancy Searby, NASA; and Louis Ostrach, Lockheed Engineering and Sciences Co. Spacelab Life Sciences-3 (SLS-3) was scheduled to be the first United States man-tended microgravity flight containing Rhesus monkeys. The goal of this flight as in the five untended Russian COSMOS Bion flights and an earlier American Biosatellite flight, was to understand the biomedical and biological effects of a micro- gravity environment using the non-human primate as human surro- gate. The SLS-3/Rhesus Project and COSMOS Primate-BIOS flights all utilized the rhesus monkey, Macaca Mulatta. The ultimate objective of all flights with an animal surrogate has been to evaluate and understand biological mechanisms at both the system and cellu- lar level, thus enabling rational effective countermeasures for future long duration human activity under microgravity conditions and enabling technical application to correction of common human physiological problems within earth's gravity, e.g., muscle strength and reloading, osteoporosis, immune deficiency diseases. Hardware developed for the SLS-3/Rhesus Project was the result of a joint effort with the French Center National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) extending over the last decade. The flight hardware design and development required implementation of suffi- cient automation to insure flight crew and animal bio- isolation and maintenance with minimal impact to crew activities. A variety of hardware of varying functional capabilities was developed to sup- port the scientific objectives of the original 22 combined French and American experiments, along with 5 Russian co-investigations, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, and behavioral studies. Unique elements of the Rhesus Research Facility (RRF) included separation of waste for daily delivery of urine and fecal samples for metabolic studies and a psychomotor test system for behavioral studies along with monitored food measurement. As in untended flights, telemetry measurements would allow monitoring of thermo- regulation, muscular, and cardiac responses to weightlessness. In contrast, the five completed Cosmos/Bion flights, lacked the meta- bolic samples and behavioral task monitoring, but did facilitate studies of the neurovestibular system during several of the flights. The RRF accommodated two adult 8-11 kg rhesus monkeys, while the Russian experiments and hardware were configured for a younger animal in the 4-6 kg range. Both the American and Russian hardware maintained a controlled environmental system, specifi- cally temperature, humidity, a timed lighting cycle, and had means for providing food and fluids to the animal(s). Crew availability during a Shuttle mission was to be an optimal condition for retrieval and refrigeration of the animal urine samples along with a manual calcein injection which could lead to greater understanding of bone calcium incorporation. A special portable bio-isolation glove box was under development to support this aspect of the experiment profile along with the capability of any contingency human intervention. As a result of recent U.S./Russian negotiations, funding for Space Station, and a series of other events, the SLS-3 mission was canceled and applicable Rhesus Project experiments incorporated into the Russian Bion 1 1 and 12 missions. A presentation of the RRF and COSMOS/Bion rhesus hardware is presented along with current plans for the hardware. 155</page><page sequence="155">941288-941294 941288. Development of experiment kits for processing bio- logical samples inflight on SLS-2. P. D. Savage and W. E. Hinds, NASA ; and R. Jaquez, J . Evans, and L. Dubrovin, Lockheed Engi- neering and Sciences Co. The Spacelab Life Sciences-2 (SLS-2) mission provided scien- tists with the unique opportunity of obtaining inflight rodent tissue and blood samples during a 14-day mission flown in October, 1993. In order to successfully obtain these samples, Ames Research Cen- ter's Space Life Sciences Pay loads Office has developed an innova- tive, modular approach to packaging the instruments used to obtain and preserve the inflight tissue and blood samples associated with the hematology experiments on SLS- 2. The design approach organized the multitude of instruments into 12 different 5x6x1 inch kits which were each used to accomplish a particular experiment functional objective on any given day during the mission. The twelve basic kits included blood processing, iso- tope and erythropoietin injection, body mass measurement, and microscope slides. Each kit contained all of the syringes, vials, microscope slides, etc. necessary for processing and storing blood and tissue samples for one rate on a particular day. On flight day 6 of the SLS-2 mission, for example, a total of 5 rats had blood sam- ples taken, radioisotope labels injected, and body mass measured. In order to fulfill these experiment functional objectives, the astro- naut crew member removed from the onboard stowage a total of 5 each of the blood processing, radioisotope injection, microscope slide, and mass measurement kits and set them up in the General Purpose Work Station (GPWS). The GPWS is a laminar flow work bench where all of the experimental procedures were carried out. For ease of stowage and transportation the kits were enclosed in larger Zero™ boxes, measuring 9.5x7x6 inches. In support of the SLS-2 mission, a total of 1245 components, packaged into 128 kits and stowed in 17 Zero™ boxes were required to complete the scientific objectives of the hematology experiments. Astronaut crew members spent many hours in training for the mis- sion using these kits and found the overall design to be extremely easy to use and laid out in a logical, simple configuration which minimizes chances for error during the complex, tedious procedures inflight. This paper also summarizes inflight performance of the kits on SLS-2. 941289. Definition of a closed and controlled Higher Plant Compartment for a closed ecological system test bed facility. Miquel Sauret and Ferran Roda, Universität Autònoma de Barce- lona ; and Christian Tamponnet, ESTEC-ESA. A new conceptual and architectural design for a Higher Plant Compartment for a Closed Ecological Life Support System in a planetary settlement proposed. The proposed HPC is transparent to make use of sunlight, adaptable to different cultivation modes and built with modules to facilitate reconfiguration and expansion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941290. NASA's advanced life support technology program. W. Berry and J. Vernikos, NASA; and K. Gaiser and P. Campbell, Lockheed Engineering and Sciences Co. For reasons of safety as well as cost, increasingly lengthy space missions at unprecedented distances from Earth in the 21st century will require reductions in consumables and increases in the auton- omy of spacecraft life support systems. Advanced life support tech- nologies can increase mission productivity and enhance science yield by achieving reductions in the mass, volume, and power required to support human needs for long periods of time in sterile and hostile environments. Current investment in developing advanced life support systems for orbital research facilities will increase the productivity of these relatively near-term missions, while contributing to the technology base necessary for future human exploration missions. With its recent reorganization, NASA has concentrated all activi- ties concerned with the human element of space exploration into a single office, the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, under the direction of the Life and Biomedical Sci- ences and Applications Division. This consolidation of research and development activities marks the initiation of a synergistic life sup- port program with a broad range of supporting elements including human factors, science requirements, mission-specific require- ments, aspects of medicine and health care, enabling technologies, applications engineering, and systems integration. Thus, NASA is taking a new and more comprehensive approach to life support with the integration of all of these elements into an evolutionary program with contributions from NASA field centers and unique facilities. 941292. A more completely defined CELSS. A. E. Drysdale, H. A. Cooley, W. M. Knott, J. C. Sager, and R. M. Wheeler, NASA; and G. W. Stutte, and C. L. Maćkowiak, Bionetics Corp. A CELSS has been defined based on current or near-term tech- nology. The CELSS was sized to support the metabolic load of four people on the Moon for ten years. A metabolic load of 14 MJ/ person/day is assumed, including an average of 2.6 hr of EVA/ person/day. Close to 100% closure of water, and oxygen, and 85% closure of the food loop is assumed. With 15% of the calories sup- plied from Earth, this should provide adequate dietary variety for the crew along with vitamin and mineral requirements. Other supply and waste removal requirements are addressed. The basic shell used is a Space Station Freedom 7.3 m (24ft) module. This is assumed to be buried in regolith to provide protec- tion from radiation, meteoroids, and thermal extremes. A solar dynamic power system is assumed, with a design life of 10 years delivering power at 368 kWh/kg. Initial estimates of size are that 73 m2 of plant growth area are required, giving a plant growth volume of 73 m3. This assumes a mixture of crops achieving production rates equal to the bast published data. With a volume of 108 m3 per module, other support equipment can be accommodated within one module. In particular, anaerobic and aerobic digestion is used to recycle inedible biomass. Automation is used to the extent necessary to keep manpower requirements in the range of 10% of the sup- ported crew time. About 100 KW of electrical power is required, primarily driven by plant irradiance. Because of the cost of rejecting low-grade waste heat to the environment during the lunar day, sun- light is assumed to be used directly for plant irradiance when avail- able. The goal of this design concept was to focus our thoughts. We believe it represents something that is achievable, although there are uncertainties in the data used to develop it. Among these uncertain- ties are the effects of fractional gravity and closure on plant growth and other biological processes, the need for appropriate automation and materials handling technologies, and the relative costs of infra- structure utilities (mass transportation, electricity, manpower, etc.). 941293. A labora tory-scale controlled ecological life support system. Mark E. Flynn, Bionetics Corp.; Cory K. Finn, NASA Ames Research Center; Venkatesh Srinivasan, Bionetics Corp.; and Sid- ney Sun, NASA Ames Research Center. A laboratory-scale controlled ecological life support system (lab- scale CELSS) is being developed in order to provide the insight, knowledge, and experience needed to design a human-rated CELSS facility. This multi-phase project will integrate pre-existing proces- sors into a closed loop regenerative life support system testbed. Phase I of the lab-scale CELSS project involves the integration of a crop growth chamber with a solid waste processor. Tests to date have shown that carbon and water can be recovered from inedible biomass for recycling to the plant chamber. This paper will describe the requirements, design, and some experimental results from Phase I of the lab-scale CELSS project and provide an overview of future phases. 941294.

A systems approach for design of integrated regener- ative life support system: a functions analysis. Edward A. Kurma- zenko, Alexander A. Fomichev, and Alexander O.

This paper deals with a Functions Analysis of the Integrated Regenerative Life Support System (IRLSS) that is of primary importance in forming the functional description and in predeter- mining the information description when in use the systems approach for the IRLSS Design. In order to attack the function temporary laws of the IRLSS sub- systems and functional blocks the following the principal questions are going to consider; (a) formulating the main problems that may be settled when use of the function analysis and choosing of the methods making available their solutions; (b) forming the mathe- matical descriptions of the technological processes and working on this basis the simulation models for the subsystem apparatuses; (c) creating the methodological and information support and associated software. The employment of given software for the solution of the design's individual problems and some results obtained in computed experiments will be discussed also. 941296. A systems approach for design of integrated regener- ative life support system: a formation of alternatives and synthe- sis of technological structures. Edward A. Kurmazenko and Alex- ander A.

This paper deals with a Systems Approach for the Design of an Integrated Regenerative Life Support System (IRLSS) based on physico-chemical methods of transforming of the crew metabolic- waste products to the controlled human environment components. To solve the initial problem of the technology's synthesis the fol- lowing principal questions are going to be considered: (a) the forma- tion of alternatives discrete set; (b) the elaboration of the integral and hypothesis structure for IRLSS and its formal description; and (c) the creation of the methodology and information support and the associated software. The IRLSS database and the application of the given software for the solution of the design's individual problems will also be dis- cussed. 941300. Flight and ground test data analysis for the heat pipe performance (HPP) experiment. Matthew T. Buchko, NASA; and Patrick J. Brennan and Tu M. Nguyen, O AO Corp. This paper presents the test results and data correlation for the Heat Pipe Performance Flight Experiment which was a Class D mid- deck experiment flown aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-52) in October of 1992. Three categories of heat pipe perfor- mance were examined: static mode, operation under applied acceler- ation, and re-wicking capability. Two aluminum/freon axially grooved heat pipes, ten copper/water axially grooved heat pipes, and four fibrous wick copper/water variable conductance heat pipes were tested. Ground and flight test results for the axially grooved heat pipes are discussed and correlated with analaytical models. Correlation of flight test data for cryogenic axially grooved oxygen heat pipes and a description of the Groove Analysis Program (GAP) is also presented. 941301. Design of a liquid metal heat pipe space experiment. Eric P. Critchley and Mary E. Corrigan, United States Air Force. Although high temperature, liquid metal heat pipe radiators have become a standard component design for many high power space systems, no experimental data on the operation of these kinds of heat pipes in a microgravity environment exists. Issues such as which wick structures or fluids work best in these conditions are unknown. In addition, the freeze/thaw behavior of liquid metals in zero-g is not well understood. The purpose of the Liquid Metal Thermal Experiment, known as LMTE, is to fill this gap in our knowledge of liquid metal heat pipes by flying three potassium heat pipes on board the Space Shuttle in 1995. 941302. Autonomous heat pipe system for electronic compo- nents thermostatting at near-earth orbit exploitation. V. Baturkin, S. Zhuk, V. Savina, Y. Khmelev, K. Shkoda, N. Gretchina, A. Savchenko, and O. Moskalenko, Kiev Polytechnic Institute. The questions of the gas filled heat pipes' s application for ther- mal control systems of scientific equipment are discussed. It is ana- lyzed different extends of electronic component's integration: creat- ing the thermal stability mounting places of devices; creating of cooled planes and surfaces on device's body and providing of ther- mal stability of internal components. It is proposed design decisions providing of compensation some variable parameters such as device heat flows, external heat influ- ences that are typical for near-earth orbits. Tests' results have shown the principal ability to construct schemes for thermal control of elec- tronic components. 941305. Columbus APM environmental control system over- view: Space Station and APM restructuring consequences. Eugenio Gargioli, Luca Nava, and Paolo Balocco, Alenia Spazio S. p. A.; and Hans Peter Leiseif er, and Giuseppe Sarri, ESA/ESTEC. This paper describes the main changes affecting the APM Envi- ronmental Control System (ECS) as a consequence of the Space Sta- tion Freedom (SSF) restructuring and Columbus APM overall reconfiguration. The main purposes of this reconfiguration are: min- imize the number and complexity of the interfaces with Space Sta- tion Freedom (SSF); centralize avionics command and monitoring tasks; revisit the failure tolerance concept of some ECS functions unify/standardize similar functions in the two subsystems; and adjust lifetime requirements and simplify maintenance concept of equipment. The APM consists of the following functions: active thermal (ATCS), passive thermal control (PTCS), atmosphere pressure and composition control, air revitalization and cabin ventilation, temper- ature and humidity control, vacuum and venting, nitrogen supply and fire detection and suppression. The new ATCS configuration provides a cooling capability for a reduced number of P/L racks by means of its moderate loop. No modification is envisaged on the low temperature loop. Failure cases on both SSF thermal buses and APM ATCS have been considered and assessed, resulting in an optimization of the ATCS operations in off-nominal modes. Due to the adoption of a new APM launcher (ARIANE 5) instead of NSTS, the Negative pressure Relief function is no longer required. A new cabin loop architecture is considered based on the use of three fans for air distribution in the APM thermal conditioning and air exchange with the adjacent SSF node (Inter- module Ventilation). As far as the Vacuum and Venting system is concerned, the only changes are the reduction of the connected lat- eral P/L racks and the deletion of the venting interface with the SSF. The same lateral P/L racks are also connected to the Nitrogen Sup- ply system with the deletion of the relevant interface valves. The main change in the Fire Detection system concerns the new location of smoke detectors within the cabin loop. The Fire Suppression sys- tem is impacted due to the reduction of the number of enclosures 157</page><page sequence="157">941305-941311 requiring a fire suppression capability. Optimization in heater con- trol has been achieved, while the decentralized valve control con- cept has been deleted in favor of a centralized one via Power Distri- bution Unit (PDU). 941306. Revised cabin loop concept for Columbus APM. Karl Honnen and, Markus Huchler, Dornier GmbH . The redesign of the international Space Station Freedom (SSF) and funding constraints in the ESA member states caused a redirec- tion of the development effort for the Attached Pressured Module (APM). For the ECLSS the most important changes are the reduc- tion in length of the module in order to make it compatible with the ARIANE V capabilities and the more severe cost constraints. As a result new concepts for the cabin loop were investigated leading to a decrease in cabin loop power consumption, mass and volume and a reduced development effort due to a lower number of items. In the previous concept a module internal loop with a flow rate of 864m3/hr and an Intermodule Ventilation (IMV) flow rate for air revitalization to the station with 240m3/hr were installed. The revised boundary conditions with a reduced overall massflow rate of 540m3/hr allows the combination of the cabin loop and the IMV with limited impact on the total power consumption. The pressure rise needed to drive the cabin loop air flow can also be used to drive the IMV airflow. Different options for such a cabin loop concept were established and analyzed with respect to configuration, power consumption and mass. Another intention was to reduce the number of hardware items needed or at least to use the same hardware in several places. Several different options that allow to eliminate the IMV fans were identified. However, at least two identical cabin fans are required. The location of the filters proved to be a design driver. Pre- vention of microbial contamination of the Condensing Heat Exchanger (CHX) and the cabin loop components located down- stream the CHX requires an air filtration upstream the CHX also for the IMV supplied air. This can be achieved either by a dedicated fil- ter for the IMV supplied air plus distributed filters in the air return grids or by a centralized filter. In the latter case the fire detection for the cabin can be performed by sensors located in the air return ducts, whereas in the first case these sensors have to be located in the cabin itself. The control of the air flows is achieved with variable speed fans and either modulating valves or a 3-way valve. For modi- fied IMV boundary conditions it is also possible to operate without feedback control. All options revealed significant savings in power, mass, envelope and development costs. The selection of the baseline option also has to consider additional system aspects as e.g., the detailed configura- tion of the endcone located components, the potential accommoda- tion of smoke sensors on the cabin walls and additional ducts from rack to the endcone. Another aspect to be considered is the assign- ment of hardware responsibilities to subcontractors, as e.g. the filter housing as integral part of the CHX. 941307. Audible noise control for Columbus APM and the ECLS. L. Eckert , Dornier GmbH; and D. Eilers, DASA/ERNO. The human engineering aspects for manned spacecraft systems, like the Columbus Attached Pressurized Module (APM) as part of the Space Station, request that the audible noise environment for the crew does not exceed certain specified limits. Airborne and struc- ture-borne noise is generated in manned spacecraft systems by sev- eral sources and transmitted via a number of transmission paths into the habitable area. The Columbus APM system level audible noise control model is described. The air loops of the Environment Con- trol and Life Support System (ECLS) form a group of major noise sources. The design implications and solutions selected for the ECLS subsystem are presented. A sound power flow model is used for system and subsystem design analysis and verification tasks. Preliminary results about the achievable audible noise environment are given. 941308. Japanese experiment module airlock pressurization/ depressurization system design and development. Robert Rubly , AlliedSignal Aerospace ; and Tetsuo Taniguchi , Shimadzu Corp. The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), being provided by NASDA for International Space Station Alpha (ISSA), is a mul- tipurpose research and development laboratory providing a shirt- sleeve environment for astronauts. The JEM will be equipped with power supply, thermal control, environmental control and life sup- port, and data handling systems. The primary components of the JEM include a pressurized module and an exposed experiment facil- ity. The pressurized module includes an airlock to facilitate transfer of equipment and supplies from within the pressurized module to the exposed facility. The JEM airlock has been designed to conserve air by pumping air from the airlock into the pressurized module prior to opening the outer airlock door to space vacuum. This is accomplished through use of the airlock pressurization/ depressurization system (APDS). The APDS also admits air back into the JEM during pressurization. The JEM APDS is comprised of three subsystems: a dehumidifier assembly, a valve assembly, and an airlock depressurization unit. Development testing of the dehu- midifier and valve assembly is currently in progress as part of the engineering model (EM) phase of the APDS program. This paper summarizes the required functions and overall design of the APDS, and describes the history and development/evolution of some of the specific components which have been selected. 941309. Architecture of the environmental control system for the mini pressurized logistics module. Ranato D'Auria, Massimo Antonacci , and Antonio Moscatelli, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. The Space Station is going to be re-defined and optimized in front of updated functional requirements. As a consequence, the MPLM could be affected by this process and subjected to design changes. In any case, the logistic function of the MPLM will be main- tained and considering its peculiarity, the importance of this pressur- ized module could be increased. 941310. Microbial contamination control and prevention during space H/W manufacturing and assembly. Enrico Gaia and Vincenzo Guarnieri, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. Microorganism accumulation and growth onboard a spacecraft may impact adversely on crew efficiency and safety as well as sys- tem, subsystems and payload. The results of test campaigns performed Alenia Spazio in Sum- mer 1993 are reported here. From them, some simple and effective prevention methods to be applied during the manufacturing and inte- gration phases of a pressurized spacecraft have been identified and are here discussed. Although data obtained from Earth experience may be consid- ered useful, it is uncertain and unfit for space station operational lifespan. Therefore, it is necessary to build a model of the phenome- non, able to provide a series of quantitative data as a function of dif- ferent parameters related to environmental characteristics, crew, and onboard activities. An experiment on board the MIR orbital station - in the frame of EUROMIR'95 mission - may validate the predic- tion model of the microbial contamination phenomena, providing input for any spacecraft design, manufacturing, and onboard envi- ronmental control systems. Such an experiment is briefly described. 941311. Conceptual considerations on crew aspects in rescue type space vehicles. W. Knorr and R. Strittmatter, Dornier GmbH; and P. Tamburini, ESA. Latest developments of the manned European space transporta- tion system programs have shifted emphasis from the winged vehi- cles (HERMES) towards unwinged, capsule type vehicles like the Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV) or the Crew Transfer Vehi- cle (CTV). While the work on the CTV is still in an early stage, a Phase A study was performed on the ACRV in late 1992 to 1993, detailing already the major subsystem layouts, among these the 158</page><page sequence="158">941311-941317 Environmental Control and Life Support System and Crew Systems such as crew seats, transport couches for injured crew members or displays and controls. Due to the particular set of requirements on this rescue vehicle, it quickly became evident that optimal layouts of these crew aspect subsystems are not necessarily easily transferable from rather well known designs of e.g. a space station. Instead, different and specific requirements such as: flexibility in accommodation of a crew from 1 to 8 members in a small confinement, limited volume and power, provision of a shirt sleeve environment inside the vehicle, medical facilities for the treatment of ill or injured crew members, long dor- mant mode of the vehicle attached to the space station, and rapid activation of the vehicle in case of an emergency also require spe- cific solutions, which may significantly differ from the known stan- dards. Some examples of those features favored for a rescue vehicle are: simple, reliable solutions for atmosphere, temperature and humidity control including, for instance, a passive humidity removal by con- sumables and specific features for contaminant removal, in particu- lar for the event of a fire suppression. 941312. A strategy for the development and selection of waste management options for spacecraft and planetary bases. Denise L. Oakley and Robert Brooks, AEA Technology; and Roger Binot, ESTEC . There is a requirement for safe, economic processing and storage of wastes generated on board a manned spacecraft or planetary base. A Waste Management Strategy flowsheet has been developed as a standardized methodology to identify and compare alternative man- agement strategies for all wastes and to select appropriate technolo- gies for their processing and storage. Using Reference Wastes and Missions, the resulting detailed Waste Management flowsheets illustrate how technology requirements can change in response to criteria defined for the missions, stability (particularly its potential for biodeterioration) of the waste with time and the quantities gener- ated. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941313. Development of the mass transfer processes for elec- trochemical concentrator of carbonic acid gas. Nadejshda S. Demidova, Moscow Aviation Institute. A cycle of fundamental studies in the field of electrodynamic assemblies of life-support and power support systems, which are related to with development of complex low consuming and closed ecologie on-board systems for orbital station of "Mir" and "Free- dom" type has finished by the author. Integrated mathematical model of multi-component electro- chemical system with volumetric chemical reactions and software are developed for the analysis of mass, pulse and energy transfer processes, estimation of entropy. Result of investigation of the mathematical model of homoge- neous and double-phase electrochemical system allowed to obtain generalized criterion equations for the mass transfer, criterion dependencies of stabilization lengths for hydrodynamics and density fields, which are very convenient in engineering for the estimation of coefficients of mass output for electrochemical concentrator of carbonic acid gas for example. 941314. ESACAP simulations of MPLM atmosphere control and supply systems. Sergio Mannu and Massimo Antonacci, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. At present, limited tools are available to model atmosphere con- trol and supply systems simply, in order to allow quick design assessments based on analytical performances. In this context, the utilization of PC based ESACAP adapted as an Atmosphere Control and Supply (ACS) simulation tool is described. The analyses results shown in this paper refer to the activ- ities of MPLM baseline re-definition carried out in accordance with the Space Station re-configuration. As a consequence, in several cases the described analyses reflect conservative assumptions and have been performed in a parametric way so as to take the uncertain- ties into account. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941315.

A mathematical model has been developed in order to support the design, engineering and testing of a membrane based biological air filter, removing and converting gas phase contaminants present within a closed environment, like manned space habitats, before they reach toxic concentrations. The configuration of the system is described by a gas phase, containing the contaminants, and a liquid phase, separated by membrane material, supporting a film of selected innocuous microorganisms in a near resting state, cataboliz- ing the contaminants to inert materials, mainly carbon dioxide, water and salts. The process simulation and its results are discussed, considering the different diffusion and biochemical processes taking place inside the biological system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941316. Advances in ECOSIM: evolution of ECLSS software towards biology-based moon base applications. Yasuo Ishii, NASDA ; and Christian Tamponnet and Mauro Novara, ESTEC. ECOSIM, a software tool for the simulation of ECLSS which has been developed for the European Space Agency (ESA), provides a powerful, friendly graphical interface to users. To test and verify the evolutional capability of ECOSIM for the simulation of ECLSSS for future missions, and also to clarify the required future improvements to ECOSIM, the ECLSS of a moon base, in its initial build-up phase, has been modeled and simulated, following the establishment of the necessary new component mathe- matical models, including biological ones. 941317. Fuel cell simulation using ECOSIM. R. Perez Vara, Empresanos Agrupados; R. Simmon, CAPE; and A. M. Davidson and M. Schautz, ESA/ESTEC. Fuel cells have become a very important part of the energy sup- ply in past, current and future space activities. In the past they have been used in the Gemini missions - their first application in space - and later in the Apollo program. Fuel cells will be employed in future American, Russian and European space vehicles where sig- nificantly larger electrical power generation is envisaged compared to early applications. This increased capacity is linked to a correspondingly larger amount of waste heat which must be managed in turn. Effective study of how best to accommodate such fuel cell systems into a space vehicle and of the impact on other subsystems - e.g. thermal control - requires a suitable simulation tool. ECOSIM is a general tool for the simulation of continuous sys- tems which has been developed for ESA by Empresarios Agrupa- dos. ECOSIM models are constructed and manipulated by the user through a "point-and-click" Graphical User Interface (GUI). The model is "drawn" by selecting pre-defined objects, including all properties and equations necessary to simulate their behavior, from a library of icons and connecting them together in a flow diagram. Calculations in the form of "experiments" are then performed upon this model. The standard library for ECLS modeling contains a reich set of components including pumps, fans, heat exchangers, controllers, etc. As a first step towards a general capability for the simulation of fuel cell systems, an alkaline system with immobile electrolyte was selected for study. This project was performed by Empresarios Agrupados, supported by CAPE. This paper describes the additional ECOSIM components which were necessary, their mathematical representation, development and implementation. Results are presented of the simulations which 159</page><page sequence="159">941317-941324 have been performed, both steady state and transient, and which show good agreement with experimental data. 941318. Heat transfer and mass transfer in microgravity and hypobaric environments. Xavier Chalandon, Dassault Aviation; Bruce W. Webbon, NASA Ames Research Center ; and Leslie D. Montgomery , National Research Council. The microgravity and hypobaric environments encounted in space flight will alter the convective and evaporative heat and mass transfer coefficients that influence thermal comfort. In this paper, models of heat and mass transfer between the human body and the environment are presented. Three mode of convection are identified: (1) free convection governed by the temperature gradient between the skin and the environment and by the acceleration of gravity, (2) forced convection governed by the ambient gas movements, and (3) mixed convection combining the previous two modes. Mixed con- vection is shown to prevail in most situations on Earth. In micro- gravity the contribution of free convection to the convective heat exchange is negligible and only forced convection must be consid- ered. The 'classic' Lewis analogy between the convective heat and mass transfer is commonly used on Earth to calculated the mass transfer coefficient from the convection coefficient. The Lewis rela- tionship is shown to be valid whatever the mode of convection. The effects of microgravity an dlow ambient pressure upon water vapor diffusion are analyzed and a special case study is performed by con- sidering the Skylab environment which combines microgravity and hypobaric environments. 941319. Analytical tools for integrating flight crew equip- ment. James L. Lewis, NASA; and Reginald M. Mac hell, Muniz Engineering, Incorporated. The computer technology currently available provides new^ana- lytical tools for integrating flight crew equipment for aerospace vehicles more efficiently and rapidly than ever before. The principal new tools are based on modeling techniques used in computer aided design. Graphical analysis tools which have been used to good advantage in the Space Station program include PLAID, Unigraph- ics, IGOAL and the Douglas Human Modeling System. Animation sequences of crew tasks based on graphical analysis have also proven valuable. Current use of computer modeling and graphical analysis techniques has shown them to be a major benefit in inte- grating flight crew equipment for aerospace vehicles. 941320. Microgravity and ground simulations of prototype health maintenance system equipment. S. L. Johnston, M. R. Campbell, R. D. Billica, and F. T. Eichstadt, NASA. This paper presents a summary of recent evaluations of prototype Health Maintenance System (HMS) equipment and medical proce- dures under development for use aboard the International Space Sta- tion. Evaluations involved a series of preparatory ground simula- tions which provided baseline data while allowing opportunities to evaluate medical operational procedures. Ground simulations were followed by a series of parabolic flights offering a microgravity environment. Data gathered in parabolic flight addressed specific questions as to the efficacy of procedures and the HMS equipment performance. 941321. Microgravity medical restraint: an adaptive approach. Frank Eichstadt, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. This paper presents an overview of the Crew Medical Restraint System (CMRS) developed for NASA by McDonnell Douglas under the Space Station Freedom Crew Health Care System (CHeCS) contract. A history of space medical restraint development reveals the evolutionary nature of the CMRS design. Requirements are discussed as they influence system functions, interfaces, physi- cal form, and materials selections. Descriptions of scenarios and environments highlight CMRS capabilities, versatility, and adapt- ability. Descriptions of prototype hardware, development tests, and test results are presented. The paper also discusses long term enhancements which adapt the CMRS to evolving space station medical requirements. The paper is illustrated with photographs of prototype hardware in use during medical simulations. 941322. Application of expert systems to enhance onboard training in long space manned missions. V. Del Re, A. Guerrazzi , and S. Masullo, Vitrociset S.p.A. This paper focuses how a tool based on Expert System technol- ogy could best meet in orbit crew training requirements specifically in the conditions of long in-orbit stay. The following important aspects are in particular addressed: Man Machine Interface (MMI); apportionment of capabilities between orbit and ground facilities; possible architectural solutions for its use in a manned space module, according to the specific constraints of the orbital environment; and evaluation of available technologies for their possible integration in the set of the tools candidate to support crew member during their orbit stay time. Emphasis is given to possibilities offered by state-of-the-art methodologies, w.r.t. knowledge acquisition, representation and maintenance, in order to provide an astronaut with quick and con- text-sensitive information about training tasks to be performed, both planned and contingent. It is shown how such knowledge-based approach allows the utili- zation of trainers' knowledge on astronauts (gained during the on- ground training sessions) regarding, for instance, the learning curves of each crew member; their single specific skills and qualifications, etc., and how it is possible to tune and ad- hoc rapid on-board train- ing course able to optimized the required intervention time in case of failure, contingency and new payload operation. A hybrid approach is described, i.e., based on both: object ori- ented programming paradigm, to represent models of payloads, sub- systems, task hierarchic structures, etc....; and production rules to represent procedural knowledge, rules of thumb, etc.... Finally, identified evolution of the technologies in this particular application field are outlined so as to recommend diverse options for future space environments, where astronauts have to live and work at the best possible conditions. 941323. Sub-optimal performance regimes - Dynamic inte- grated simulations. Scott R. Johnson, Rockwell Aerospace. Human performance is the essential element of manned space flight. Manned space flight need not exist were robots or other devices sufficient to accomplish our specific goals in space. How- ever, we know that humans are required for certain tasks, and we also know that the costs associated with humans in space are high. Therefore, anything which can be done to lower costs and improve human performance without jeopardizing safety are in the best inter- ests of manned space flight. We advocate the use of simulations, not only to prepare and train for mission operations, but to analyze and improve the Human Factors aspect of space systems design. We herein describe the steps necessary to create these simulations and the anticipated benefits. 941324. Crew work station update for Space Station Alpha. Susan E. Cotter, Consultant; and Reginald M. M ache II, Muniz Engi- neering, Inc. Redesign of the Space Station to the Alpha configuration has led to significant changes in the crew work stations. The Multi- Purpose Applications Console, which was the primary crew interface with the Data Management System, has been deleted and replaced with a laptop computer. The proposed design process for these new work stations includes analysis and definition of the crew functions, the display and control requirements and the conceptual layouts of candidate work stations. Following crew acceptance of static mockups, detailed functional simulations must be conducted for crew evalua- tion of the proposed configurations, particularly for the Robotics Control Work Stations. 160</page><page sequence="160">941326-941331 941326. Unfurlable radiator for lunar base heat rejection. Nelson J. Gernert and Kenneth G. Donovan, Thermacore, Inc. A proof-of-concept (POC) lightweight lunar radiator was fabri- cated and tested. The POC radiator has a specific weight of 5 kg/kW one quarter the specific weight of current space radiators. The sig- nificant weight reduction was due to the radiator's unique design. It is a multi-cellular heat pipe radiator utilizing the lunar gravity for condensate return. The innovation of this radiator is the laminated film material used as the heat pipe envelope. By utilizing a flexible, durable, leak tight laminate structure instead of the typical ridged heat pipe envelope, significant weight reductions were achieved. In addition, the resulting radiator is extremely flexible, allowing it to be rolled or folded and compactly stored during transit to the lunar surface. Testing demonstrated that a laminated film heat pipe radia- tor offers improved performance and significant mass savings over conventional space radiators. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941327. Development of lightweight radiators for lunar based power systems. Albert J. Juhasz and Harvey S. Bloomfield, NASA. This report discusses application of a new lightweight carbon- carbon (C-C) space radiator technology developed under the NASA Civil Space Technology Initiative (CSTI) High Capacity Power Pro- gram to a 20 kWc lunar based power system. This system comprises a nuclear (SP- 100 derivative) heat source, a Closed Bray ton Cycle (CBC) power conversion unit with heat rejection by means of a plane radiator. The new radiator concept is based on a C-C compos- ite heat pipe with integrally woven fins and a thin walled metallic liner for containment of the working fluid. Using measured areal specific mass values (1.5 kg/m2) for flat plate radiators, comparative CBC power system mass and performance calculations show signif- icant advantages if conventional heat pipes for space radiators are replaced by the new C-C heat pipe technology. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941328. Feasibility of using in-situ lunar soil as a latent ther- mal energy storage media. Karl Baker, James E. Calógeras, and Scott W., Richter, NASA. An experiment was designed, fabricated and tested at the NASA Lewis Research Center to investigate the concept of using the sur- face layer of the moon to store thermal energy. The concept includes using the energy stored within the surface as a thermal input to drive a solar dynamic power system. The solar dynamic power system would operate using the suns thermal input during the lunar day and would continue to operate during the lunar night using the thermal energy stored within the cavity. The experiment modeled in a lunar thermal energy storage con- cept by applying a heat flux to the surface of simulated lunar soil equivalent to what a primary and secondary solar concentrator could produce with a concentration ratio of 2000: 1 . The experiment was designed to determine if the surface layer of the lunar soil could be melted using the equivalent heat flux from a radiative heating element mounted above the simulated lunar soil. If a melt occurred, the melt characteristic including the formation shape and amount of the soil melted was to be evaluated. Other objectives of the experiment included studying the effects of re- melting the soil after the molten cavity solidifies, and generating a temperature profile throughout the soil as the heat cycle was applied. The experiment successfully generated a cavity within the sur- face layer of the simulated soil. This report describes the experiment in detail and highlights the results. It demonstrates the feasibility of melting the lunar soil with a solar concentrator. These results are the first step towards developing a lunar solar dynamics system which stores thermal energy in the surface layer of the lunar soil. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941329. Shuttle space suit glove thermal protection and per- formance improvement evolution. David Graziosi, Dave Cado- gan, and Mark Grahne, ILC Dover, Inc.; and Joseph Kosmo, NASA. The success of astronauts performing Extra- Vehicular Activity (EVA) is highly dependent on the performance capabilities of their spacesuit gloves. Thermal protection of crewmember's hands has always been a critical concern but has recently become more impor- tant because of the increasing role of the crewmember in the manip- ulation of objects in the environment of space. The utilization of EVA for challenging missions, such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) repair and Space Station assembly missions, has prompted the need for improved glove thermal protection. The increased manipulation of hot and cold objects is necessary to complete these complex missions. Thermal protection of the spacesuit glove is accomplished by the Thermal and Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG). The TMG is a mul- tilayered cover that fits over the restraint layer of the spacesuit glove. The TMG is engineered to provide thermal protection for crewmember's hands as well as for the glove bladder and restraint. Although the TMG is necessary for thermal protection, it increases crew fatigue and reduces tactility and dexterity because of its bulk. In extreme cases, a thermal mitten can be used over the TMG to enhance thermal performance. However, the performance decre- ment associated with the bulk of the TMG is magnified with the use of the thermal mitten. In an effort to improve extravehicular glove thermal perfor- mance, decrease hand fatigue and improve tactility and dexterity performance, several design enhancements have been developed, tested and incorporated into the spacesuit glove. This paper addresses design enhancements, glove TMG evolution, thermal per- formance testing methods, test results and future concepts for ther- mal performance improvements. 941330. Essential aspects of space suit operating pressure trade-off. Isaak P. Abramov, Anatoly Yu Stoklitsky, Arnold S. Barer, and Sergei N. Filipenkov, RD &amp; PE ZVEZDA. The operating pressure value is one of the principal consider- ations for trade-off analysis of the space suit enclosure and the indi- vidual life support subsystem (LSS). From the physiological point of view, the same level of pressure in the suit and space vehicle reflects the best solution. Current Russian space vehicles and orbit- ing stations use the "Earth atmosphere." A suit operating pressure at such a level would result in complicated and technically unrea- sonable designs. Improved mobility of the pressurized suit and enhanced performance characteristics of the LSS can be offered with the minimized positive pressure. However, the minimized suit pressure concept leads to the increased risk of crewmemeber decompression sickness. Therefore, the suit operating pressure selection calls for a trade-off of physio- logical tolerances of the crewmember versus technical feasibility of this or that solution as principal considerations. The paper reviews the effect of the suit operating pressure on cer- tain technical characteristics of a space suit, in particular, mobility, amount of oxygen available to compensate for leakage, mass and strength as well as on metabolic rate. The paper reviews also physio- logical criteria which affect the selection of the suit operating pres- sure. Based on the presented information, recommendations are given as to the trade selection of the suit operating pressure. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941331. Performance of EVA suit soft flat pattern mobility joints. Valentin Menendez , Zodiac Española S.A.; Martin Diener, Dornier GmbH; and Jose Manuel Baez, CDTI. This paper presents an analysis of the results of four years of the- oretical and experimental work on EVA Suit Flat Pattern Soft Joints performed within the framework of the predevelopment work for the European EVA Space Suit under an ESA contract. During this proj- ect the most representative EVA Suit mobility joint breadboards have been designed and manufactured and a specific test bench has been developed and constantly perfected to perform a complete series of mobility joints tests. 161</page><page sequence="161">941331-941337 Flat Pattern Soft Joints are used from the glove fingers mobility joints to the waist mobility joint and the combination with bearings gives good mobility performances. These performances are best adapted to the EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) task requirements and can be used for all of the EVA suit mobility joints. The technol- ogy of the suit flat pattern mobility soft joints, is of course, a key issue of the general mobility performance. The paper is a continuation of the SAE paper series 932098 ' 'Performance of EVA suit Mobility Joints Influence of Driving Parameters,* ' (23rd International Conference on Environmental Systems, Colorado Springs, July 1993) which identifies the EVA Suit mobility joints design driving parameters. All the flat pattern soft joints referenced on this paper have been designed under the European EVA Space Suit specifications and integrated into the Suit Demonstrator. The object of the paper is the analysis of the flat pattern soft joints performances according to each design driving parameter in order to give an assessment of the flat pattern soft joints behavior and possibilities. It starts with the flat pattern soft joints definition and joints concepts identification and follows on with the analysis of the torque performances of the flat pattern soft joints as a function of the following design driving parameters: ♦Pressure - Flat pattern soft joints performances as a function of the inner pressure from zero to 700 hPa (the inner pressure of the passenger aircraft). ♦Mobility - Flat pattern soft joints as a function of the range of motion. ♦Stability - Flat pattern soft joints as a function of the angular speed and range of motion. ♦Kinematics - Flat pattern soft joints as a function of the imposed center of rotation. ♦Sizing - Flat pattern soft joints as a function of the joint diame- ter. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941332. The effect of hypercapnia on the decompression sick- ness risk during simulated extravehicular activity. Vladimer P. Katuntsev, Igor P. Poleshchuk , and Raisa T. Kazakova, Institute of Biomedical Problems. This study compared the effect of increased CO2 partial pressure in atmosphere up to 30 mm Hg (i.e. hypercapnia) on the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) during decompressions simulating space extravehicular activity (EVA). Test subjects were exposed to a pressure 330, 308 and 261 mm Hg, breathed O2- CO2 gas mixture under experimental or 100 O2 control conditions. DCS symptoms (joint pains) developed in 32.7% (33/101) of control and 67.9% (72/ 106) of experimental exposures (p&lt;0.05). This finding is of impor- tance for delivering medical support during EVA. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941333. Human physiological model during extra- vehicular activities. Françoise Monchoux and Françoise Thellier, LESETH; Frank Bagiana, ESA/ESTEC; and Arnold Barer, ZVEZDA. Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) are very safety and mission critical. Therefore, the thermoregulation and cardio-pulmonary responses of an astronaut to the environmental constraints during EVA have to be simulated to support various activities: human physiology research, procedures definitions, astronaut training, space suit design, and prediction of astronaut status. A software model allowing the simulation of all these human physiological functions has been developed. The model has been connected to a draft model of the space suit and to various environmental condi- tions, allowing evaluation and testing. The paper presents the method and assumptions made to define the various algorithms of the mathematical models. Results from the test and validation ses- sions, which were based on the comparison with real data acquired during actual experiences, are also covered. 941334. Modifications of physiological processes concerning extravehicular activity in microgravity. Michael Powell, William Norfleet, and Jim Waligóra, NASA ; K. V. Kumar, KRUG Life Sci- ences; and Ron Robinson, and Bruce Butler, University of Texas. The incidence of DCS in null gravity appears to be considerably less than predicted by 1-g experiments. In NASA studies in 1-g, 83% of the incidents of DCS occur in the legs. We report first on a study with a crossover design that indicated a considerable reduc- tion in the decompression doppler bubble grade in the lower extrem- ities in subjects in simulated microgravity (bed rest) as compared to themselves when ambulatory in unit gravity. Second we describe the results of a cardiovascular decondition- ing study using a tail-suspended rat model. Since there may be a reduction in bubble production in 0-g, this would reduce the possi- bility of acquiring neurological DCS, especially by arterial gas embolism. Further, cardiovascular deconditioning appears to reduce the pulmonary artery hypertension (secondary to gas embolization) necessary to effect arterialization of bubbles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941335. EVA Suit 2000 - Concept and architecture of the suit enclosure. A. Stoklitzky, RD&amp;PE Zvezda; M. Diener, Dornier GmbH; and J. -P. Lentz , Sabca. Since 1992 studies were conducted to define a common Europe- an/Russian Space Suit to replace the Russian space suit Orlan-DMA and the former planned European Hermes EVA suit development program. This so called EVA Suit 2000 is a joint development initi- ated by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian Space Agency (RKA). This paper presents the actual development status of the EVA Suit 2000 suit enclosure. After an overview on the Russian and European previous suit developments, the suit* s architecture and major components are described. Finally the paper gives an outlook on the development work continuation, the development logic and the test and analysis approaches to be applied. 941336. Manufacturing and testing of a space suit arm seg- ment using the OFFES. U. Rieck, W. Fischer, and J. Walter, Deut- sche Aerospace; M. C. Tosi, ALENIA SPAZIO; and J. Witt, and L. Fanchi, European Space Research and Technology Centre. The outermost fabric of an astronaut's space suit is directly exposed to the various space environmental hazards and therefore had to withstand the various loads arising during EVA operation. In a previous study phase the Outer Fabric for a European Space Suit (OFFES) has been developed using advanced technology and special surface protection components. Different design versions have been manufactured - using 3-D weaving as well as 3-D knitting technology -and were subjected to a test campaign covering the investigation of mechanical/tribological, chemical, thermo-optical and micrometeorite and debris (M/D) protection properties of the material. The current phase is concerned with the further development of the fabric for its application on a space suit. For this purpose an arm segment of a thermal and micrometeorite protection garment (TMP) has been manufactured using a further improved version of the OFFES fabrics. Tests were performed to simulate the environmen- tally and operationally induced impacts experienced by the fabric during EVA. Results concerning the thermal/thermo-optical properties and arm bending behavior are presented. 941337. CO2 processing and O2 reclamation: recent technol- ogy developments for the first closed loop in ECLSS. Wolfram Knorr and Helmut Funke, Dornier GmbH; Gijsbert Tan, ESTEC; K. Ravindranathan Thampi and Michael Grätzel, EP FL; and N. M. Gupta, BARC. The longer human beings in closed habitats need to be supplied with life support functions, the more the closure of the ECLSS loops becomes a must. This is certainly valid for habitats in space, where 162</page><page sequence="162">941337-941343 a steady resupply of consumables from Earth is impossible due to excessive distances or prohibitive high cost, but it may apply in gen- eral to earthbound habitants as well, if for instance large submarines want to extend their diving time. In two harmonized programs for the two customers European and German Space Agency (ESA/ESTEC, DARA), Dornier is now in charge with the development of the technologies for the closure of the oxygen loop. This system, designed to eliminate the carbon dioxide (CO2), produced by the metabolism of three persons, from the cabin atmosphere and to recover the oxygen (O2) to return it to the cabin again, consists of three assemblies: -Solid Amine Water steam Desorbed (SAWD) CO2 concentrator -Sabatier Methanation Reactor (SMR) to convert the CO2 and additionally fed hydrogen (H2) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) -Fixed Alkaline Electrolyzer (FAE) to reclaim the oxygen from the SMR product water and to provide hydrogen for the SMR All three assemblies have been developed and tested over the past years, the issue for the current program was to investigate their interaction. This paper reports on the following: combined operation of SAWD and SMR and operation of the FAE with water produced by the SMR. Furthermore additional aspects which were investigated on these assemblies, are reported such as: improvement of the FAE with respect to its capability to run in a cyclical power on/off- mode, comparison of the SMR developed under the ESTEC contract with a Russian SMR, and development of a low temperature methanation catalyst for the SMR. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941338. CO2 removal by hydrophobic molecular sieves, II. S. K. Rose and M. Stümplfle, CARRAR; R. A. J. Dams and S. C. Moore, CJB Developments, Ltd.; and G. Tan, ESTEC. Hydrophobic molecular sieves may present a very interesting alternative for the removal of carbon dioxide from air within a closed regenerative life support system, such as that within a crewed spacecraft. An ongoing study is researching and testing a variety of materials providing comparative static and dynamic test data. These data pro- vide information concerning the performance of the chosen materi- als at representative conditions and the operational protocol best adapted to the selective adsorption of CO2 by the hydrophobic molecular sieves. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941339. Membrane technology for carbon dioxide separation in life support systems. W. Jehle, Th. Staneff, J. Steinwandel, and B. Wagner, Dornier GmbH. Future manned space missions and space stations require almost completely closed ECLSS-loops. One important problem is the sep- aration and concentration of CO2 from cabin air and the subsequent recovery of oxygen. A complete C02-processing system has been developed at Dornier consisting of a CO2- separation and concentra- tion unit (Solid Amine Water Desorption system - SAWD), a cata- lytic C02-methanation reactor (Sabatier) and a process water elec- trolyzer for final oxygen and hydrogen recovery. The current work intends to develop an appropriate membrane-based process as an alternative to the SAWD-process, in order to reduce energy con- sumption, volume and weight and to provide continuous operation. An extended screening of commercially available solution- diffu- sion membranes has been performed with the result that the poly- mers cannot meet the requirements for the advantageous replace- ment of the SAWD-system. A much better performance has been found by using novel car- rier mediated transport membranes (facilitated transport). Signifi- cant improvements in permeability and selectivity were realized by using the flowing liquid membrane technology. Another development route consists of using fixed carrier trans- port membranes (amine bases) and special selective polymer coated substrates. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941341. BAF-detection of microbial contamination and iden- tification of biofilm bacterial strains in a biological air filter. J. J. van der Waarde, D. Jager, and S. Keuning, Bioclear Environmen- tal Biotechnology; P. G. Paul, Comprimo b.v.; and R. A. Binot, European Space Agency-ESTEC. A biological airfilter (BAF) is designed for the recycling of cabin air in crewed spacecraft. A literature study was conducted to select an appropriate method for the detection, identification, and enumer- ation of autochtonous bacterial strains and possible (pathogenic) infections in the air filter. The most suitable technique appears to be the use of fluores- cently labeled 16S rRNA probes. The DNA labels can selectively bind to intact bacterial cells, thus enabling a quantitative detection with flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. Detection of pos- sible infections can be performed with 16S rRNA probes or with PCR detection kits for a more sensitive detection. 941342.

BAF-EXEMSI '92: Testing of the biological air filter for air quality control during a manned space mission simula- tion. Roger A. Binot, ESA/ESTEC; R. J. Breukers and P. G. Paul, Comprimo b.v.; and D. Jager, Bioclear Environmental Biotechnol- ogy • The concept for the 'Biological Air Filter' (BAF) is based onto the property of certain selected microorganisms for the complete oxidation to water, carbon dioxide and salts, of gaseous contami- nants. The EXEMSI manned space mission simulation campaign offered a good opportunity for testing the performances of an exper- imental BAF on a real confined atmosphere. Major obtained results are: 1. Confirmation of the validity of the fundamental concepts selected for the BAF, i.e., the use of an engi- neered microbial population, and the immobilization of this popula- tion in a membrane reactor. 2. Confirmation of the applicability of microbial conversion to a very wide range of contaminants concen- trations from SMAC values (usually ppm range; working range for previous laboratory testing) to extremely low concentrations (ppb range) observed during the campaign. 3. Identification of comple- mentary bioconversion capability as compared to what was known before the campaign for the microbial population used; this applies for a number of still unidentified compounds (C3.7, C4.8, C6.2, CI 0.3 and CI 3.2), for ethyne, ethene, propene and propane, and for isopropanol and methane for which the population was not adapted in the preparatory laboratory phase. Among the degraded contaminants, elimination yield for the identified contaminants ranges around 10 to 40% for methane, 50 to 90% for acetone, 80 to 99% for isopropanol and above 99.9% for toluene. Computer modeling shows that such a methane conversion efficiency (obtained for a single passage through a BAF) is suffi- cient to maintain the methane concentration in a space cabin below the SMAC value. As a side result, the trace contamination regime in EXEMSI was experienced being characterized by very sharp and large changes in concentrations; a further conclusion regarding confinement experi- ments is hence the need for continuous or integrating monitoring of trace contaminants. 163</page><page sequence="163">941344-941348 941344.

Volker Blüm and Michael Andriske , Ruhr Univ.; Karlheinz Kreuzberg, German Aerospace Research Establishment; and Martin P. Schreibman, Brooklyn College. The "Closed Equilibrated Biological Aquatic System" (C.E.B. A.S.) is originally dedicated to long-term multi- generation experi- ments with aquatic organisms in a space station (a national German option for the COLUMBUS module). The development of the labo- ratory prototype and the results of the international multidisciplinary zoological frame program was frequently presented at most space- relevant congresses and symposia since 1989. It consists of three components: 1. an aquatic animal tank with water recycling system (ZOOLOGICAL COMPONENT), 2. an aquatic higher plant cham- ber or microalgal bioreactor (BOTANICAL COMPONENT) and 3. a process control system (ELECTRONICAL COMPONENT). This system has a volume of approximately 100 liters was already suc- cessfully mid-term tested in its second and optimized version in which the BOTANICAL COMPONENT was filled with a rootless higher water plant. In addition, for spacelab or biosatellite experi- ments a MINI MODULE of the C.E.B.A.S. system fitting into a spa- celab middeck locker tray was developed and tested in parallel the second version of which exhibited a biological stability between fishes, higher water plants and microorganisms of more than 40 days as reported on the World Space Congress in 1992. In the same year a third and highly optimized version of the C.E.B. A.S. -MINI MODULE was elaborated and tested from December 1992 until March 1993. As its precursors it has a total volume of about 1 1 liters and consists of the following subcomponents: main animal tank, bacteria filter, coarse filter, plant chamber and second "small ani- mal" chamber. The water is driven through the system by a rotatory pump, the main animal tank and the plant chamber are illuminated by 4 W fluorescent lamps (adjustable for the latter). For emergency cases a gas exchanger is inactively positioned in a closed side loop. A simple data acquisition is permanently monitoring pH-value, redox potential, pressure, temperature and oxygen saturation. During the experiment all relevant ions and the water hardness were determined chemically in daily intervals. The photoperiod of the main animal tank was 12:12 hours the plants were permanently illuminated. The agreed experimental animals of the international C.E.B.A.S. scientific frame program were utilized; the ovopvivipa- rous teleost fish species Xiphophorus helleri and the pulmonate water snail Biomphalaria glabrata. As in all preliminary system tests a tropical rootless Ceratophyllum species served as experimental plant. So, the MINI MODULE consists of the same components as the original system: ZOOLOGICAL COMPONENT, BOTANICAL COMPONENT and ELECTRONICAL COMPONENT. The only modifications are the 1 : 12 scaled-down volume and the minimized data acquisition/process control system. The paper presents the hardware design and detailed the physical, chemical and biological data of the mid-term test. It has be to pointed out, moreover, that the C.E.B.A.S. system in general represents an artificial (man-made) aquatic ecosystem and that the results of the test of the third version of the C.E.B.A.S. MINI MODULE - including first microbiological investigations on the filter systems-allows an initial approach to an ecological system analysis with well-defined parameters. This con- tributes novel aspects for the development of innovative systems for combined aquacultural production methods for animal and plant biomasses as well for terrestrial utilization as for components of lunar or planetary base bioregenerative life support systems. The lat- ter aspect will be critically analyzed from different points of view. Besides of these futuristic contemplations, however, the basic evalu- ation of this test shows clearly that the C.E.B. A.S. -MINI MODULE is more than suitable for mid-term spacelab or biosatellite missions up to a minimum of 8 weeks. Therefore the spaceflight hardware of a spacelab middeck locker version of the C.E.B.A.S. MINI MOD- ULE went into industrial construction in June 1993 by order of the German Space Agency (DARA). 941345. Study of the nitrifying compartment in MELISSA. S. Zeghal, Anjou Recherche ; L. BenYahia, Ecole Centrale Paris; Ch. Lasseur, European Space Agency; and F. Rogalla, Anjou Recherche. Support media for the fixation of nitrifying bacteria were com- pared. Polystyrene beads were found to be the most effective among the media tested. It was shown that axenic cultures of pure strains of bacteria do not lead to better performance than bacteria seeded from the waste water. Loads as high as 1.6 Kg N-NH4/m3 reactor d"1 could be eliminated on the selected media, and oxygen was found to be limiting under 3.5 mg/1 of concentration for the fixed bacteria. 941346. The liquefying compartment of the MELISSA cycle: evaluation of three thermophilic strains. Leen Meheus, Ilse Ker- sters, and Willy Ver straete, University of Gent. MELISSA is a micro-organism based ecosystem, designed to recycle waste products, primarily through anaerobic processes. In order to have an efficient cycling of elements such as C, N, S, the degradation of biological polymers, present in the MELISSA sub- strate, is a crucial step. In this paper batch experiments to evaluate the cellulolytic capacity of Clostridium thermocellum and Clostrid- ium thermosaccharolyticum are described. A thermophilic proteo- lytic strain was isolated from a dry anaerobic composting reactor digest. The strain was taxonomically studied and identified as Coprothermobacter proteolyticus 18, a strictly anaerobic bacterium. Five proteins and ten carbohydrates were tested as a substrate for the isolated strain. Growth of the three strains on rat faeces (= test substrate) was monitored. Both Clostridium strains failed to grow in the substrate whereas Coprothermobacter could grow. The proteo- lytic activity of Coprothermobacter proteolyticus should be improved. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941347. MELISSA: Behaviour of the ecosystem under differ- ent light radiant energy inputs. L. Poughon, C. G. Dussap, and J. F. Cornet, University Blaise Pascal ; and J. B. Gros, Univeristy Blaise Pascal. The MELISSA (microbial ecological life support system alteran- tive) project was designed as an early model of a future artificial ecosystem for long-term space missions. It centers on the recovery of edible biomass from waste, CO2 and minerals, with direct use of light as a source of energy for photosynthesis. MELISSA is com- posed of four axenic compartments colonized by microorganisms, and a fifth compartment formed by the crew on board the craft. Simulation of the entire MELISSA loop had been performed to obtain mass fluxes and concentrations of microorganisms, and liq- uid and gas components in all the system streams. This first approach helped to define the process conditions necessary to obtain complete recycling of nitrogen or regeneration of the atmosphere. This paper reports on the simulation of the behaviour of the loop when the photosynthetic compartment is working under various light-limiting conditions. As the radiant light energy flux is increased, the carbohydrate composition of the biomass changes radically. The description of the compartments is modified to allow for these changes in biomass composition and to calculate the per- centage of closure of the loop (nitrogen recycling, oxygen regenera- tion and CO2 reduction) as a function of radiant light energy flux. In addition, the experimental results obtained on the other com- partments are taken into account, providing a reviewed assessment of the performance of the MELISSA loop. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941348. ' 'Symbiose:" Technology developments for biore- generation in space. Luzian Wolf and François Brechignac, ESA - ESTEC. Dedicated technology has been developed to support long-term biological experiments on-board spacecraft. These developments include a microgravity compatible tubular photo bioreactor for the cultivation of micro algae at very high biomass concentrations and with very high gas exchange rates, a microgravity compatible gas/ 164</page><page sequence="164">941348-941356 liquid phase separator which also works as a pneumatic low shear- stress pump, a microgravity compatible dehumidifier, and a maltose separating reverse osmosis unit. Integration of these technologies into a partially closed artificial ecosystem form the foundation of the SYMBIOSE concept (System for Microgravity Bioregenerative Support of Experiments). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941349. Application of classical control theory to off-design operations of a fluid loop system. Masao Furukawa, NASDA. Off-design operation problems of a cold plate row and of a space radiator row, encountered in fluid loop control, are solved to find possible inlet/outlet temperatures or to specify a required flow rate. Solutions of the problems are given in the form suitable for numeri- cal computations and are graphically shown in the figures for vari- ous combinations of control variables. Mathematical analyses are then made to yield transfer functions of a cold plate and of a second- order delay system, mainly dependent on the heat transfer unit num- ber and the heat capacity rate ratio. The expressions are generalized so as to be applicable to a series of cold plates or space radiators. A further analysis based on such generalized transfer functions is made to develop a method of feedback/feedforward control. Numer- ical results of the analysis are summarized in the table and also are displayed in the figures. Presented are: 1) the proportional gain and the reset time to actually be used in PI (Proportional-Integral) con- trol and 2) coefficient values of the transfer function proposed for feedforward control. Stability conditions are also discussed and are expressed in inequalities. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941350. Venting simulation of multiple compartment space- craft. S. Rheault, P. Theophanous, and M. Donato , Spar Aerospace Ltd. The transient pressure history experienced by spacecraft during launch and ascent creates pressure differences that have to be accounted for in the mechanical design of different spacecraft com- ponents. In addition, for high power applications, the venting times must be estimated to ensure that the pressure has dropped below the critical value for corona for both ground testing and in orbit power up. Therefore, an accurate design tool for simulating the venting of multiple enclosures was developed. The Spacecraft Venting Simula- tion Software (SVSS) calculates the mass flow rates, pressures and pressure differentials for multiple interconnected compartments. The venting can be calculated for circular or annular connections. The flow process can be either isothermal or adiabatic and can simu- late various ambient pressure profiles. The mass flow rate is calcu- lated for either a continuum or a molecular flow regime. Friction loss encountered for high aspect ratio orifices is also taken into account. The results of different simulations are in good agreement with published in-flight venting data. 941351. Flexible data acquisition and control system for TPX/G557. M. H. J. B. Versteeg, A. Monkel, J. Verpoorte, and J. Jaarsma, National Aerospace Laboratory. This paper describes the Data Acquisition and Control (DAC) system developed for the Two Phase experiment (TPX). TPX has flown on the US Space Shuttle STS60 as Get Away Special (GAS) G557. The objective of the TPX is to demonstrate the behavior of a capillary pumped two phase heat transfer system in low-gravity environment. During the flight the DAC system is operating stand- alone, controlling the experiment steps and collecting and storing the experiment results. A table driven approach for the control software was selected to obtain a configurable and flexible data acquisition system. The flex- ibility was required to allow for late adaptation of the experiment parameters and sequences within the short time frame of the project. 941352. Evaluation of mission electromagnetic irradiation with ESABASE/SUNLIGHT. P. Rosenthal , W. Keil, and R. Bisanz, Dornier GmbH ; and J. Sorensen, ESA/ESTEC. ESABASE/SUNLIGHT is a software tool to calculate illumina- tion, effective illumination, exposure time, incident electromagnetic power, absorbed electromagnetic energy for spacecraft surfaces dur- ing planet orbiting missions considering sun and planet irradiation, effects of eclipse and self-shading, multi- reflections, transmission, pointing and (variable) geometry. Calculation applies a fast Monte Carlo raytracing algorithm and is based on wavelength dependent spectra and material properties. ESABASE/SUNLIGHT is fully integrated in the CAE-frame ESABASE which offers a powerful geometry specification lan- guage, orbit generator, pointing facility and advanced libraries as well as gateway, pre-, post-processing and display tools with the benefits of standardization and exchange to other analysis tools. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941353. Energy utilization concepts for the CELSS Antarctic Analog Project (CAAP). C. L. Straight, Bionetics Corp.; L. Koh- out, D. L. Bubenheim, and M. T. Flynn, NASA; and M. E. Bates, Bionetics Corp. One of the crucial issues associated with advanced life support systems is the issue of energy consumption and utilization. This is of paramount importance in food production, resource recovery and waste processing. Because of the difficult logistics, the South Pole Station represents a unique opportunity for the development of the concepts of energy consumption and utilization. The CELSS Ant- arctic Analog Project (CAAP) is being developed and deployed for operations at the South Pole Station to conduct a validation of CELSS and life support techniques and approaches under severe, isolated and realistic conditions. These polar conditions are analo- gous to space mission scenarios, a Mars surface habitat or a Lunar encampment mission. This paper will explore methods and pro- cesses for maximizing the effectiveness and benefits of CAAP while reducing the overall energy penalty in its operation. CAAP will accomplish this through a combination of the following: 1.) the implementation and integration of high efficiency components and equipment groups, 2.) through the effective integration of CAAP with the South Pole Station infrastructure to maximize 44 waste" heat utilization and the maximum extraction of useful work from that 4 'lost" energy and 3.) through the incorporation and utilization of in-situ energy resources. Estimates will be reported for energy use, efficiencies and energy demand with impacts to the South Pole Station. 941356. Astronaut work environment underwater simula- tion. Carol Viberti, Wubbo J. Ockels, and Pete R. C oison, ESTEC. The Columbus Program represents the European contribution to the international Space Station to provide a habitable environment in the low Earth orbit for technological and scientific research requiring microgravity conditions. Since 1990, the authors of this article have been analyzing astro- naut activities to be conducted within the Columbus pressurized module, by means of underwater simulations in ordinary swimming pools and on parabolic flights with very simple mockups. The large test campaign at the 1993 Air and Space Show of Le Bourget (Paris) was conducted jointly with the ESA Columbus Sys- tem and Project Department and the EuroColumbus consortium, in particular Alenia and ERNO. The following summary provides a brief overview on the most important results attained by this campaign, covering the following aspects: a. scientific and subsystem rack design requirements, exchange and installation procedures; b. design guidelines for crew support equipment and restraints, such as foot restraints, handrails and handles, for both internal and extra- vehicular activity; c. sub- system equipment and utilities servicing and maintenance tasks; d. crew work station set-up and utilization, including the utilization of a multi-task portable work bench restrained to a banister (central aisle mechanical support facility); and e. examination of modifica- tions introduced as results of previous tests. 165</page><page sequence="165">941357-941364 941357. Italian activities on space habitats simulation. Daniele Bedini, Futuro srl Think Tank and Marketing. Underlab, now in an operational phase, is the first example of a new Italian activity on space simulation. The paper will present this project and the first isolation mission's results. The activities related to space architecture and habitability, developed in Florence by FUTURO srl and University of Florence, will be implemented by 1995 with the organisation of International Space Univ. Affiliate Campus for Space Architecture in Florence and the developing of a testing facility for space habitability items, advanced subsystems hardware and human performance. The paper will present this project and some examples related to interdisciplin- ary reasearch able to influence subsystems hardware and to develop new controlled environments for space habitats. 941358. A comparative study between different psychological approaches during an ESA space simulation. Elisabth Rosnet, l'Université de Reims; Claude Bachelard, Service Médical Institut Français de Recherche de Technologie Polaires; and Geneviève Cazes, Christine Le Scanff, and Jean Rivolier , l'Université de Reims. The objectives are to compare different psychological methods used to assess the evolution of the interrelations inside the crew and the relationships between the crew and the outside in a sixty days isolation/confinement' s simulation. After presenting each method, results are compared. The discus- sion tries to point out if these methods are equivalent or if they are complementary. The specificity of each method is shown and con- clusions try to associate some methods with specific scientific goals. 941361. D-2 acceleration characterization. Hans Hamacher and Udo Bluemel, German Aerospace Research Establishment. During the Second German Spacelab Mission D-2, extensive on- board measurements of the residual acceleration had been per- formed. The payload was equipped with the accelerometer packages distributed over the entire Spacelab module. The Microgravity Mea- surement Assembly (MMA) was the core system comprising fixed mounted as well as mobile sensor packages. On-board video has been taken as means to correlate the measured accelerations with mission events. The D-2 microgravity characterization program also included numerical calculations to predict low frequency effects which cause accelerations outside the sensor detection range. Results of characteristic quiet mission phases show that the micro- gravity level of D-2 was below the requirements of the Space Sta- tion. Data of active phases reveals what can be done to improve the microgravity quality of Spacelab missions by payload design and operation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941362. QSAM - An approach to detect low frequency accel- eration in Spacelab. H. Hamacher , R. Jilg, and H. E. Richter , Ger- man Aerospace Research Establishment. Most of the microgravity experiments show highest sensitivity to residual acceleration in the low frequency range, typically below 0.01 Hz where atmospheric drag, gravity gradient and centrifugal forces are pre-dominant. QSAM (Quasi-Steady Acceleration Mea- surement) is an instrument especially developed to detect this range where conventional methods are hampered by high amplitude noise problems entailing errors in measurement results. Noise is defined to include all disturbing contributions surrounding the signal, which the experimentalist wants to reject but has no control over the source because of its unpredictable nature. One of the most disturbing noise source covering the low frequency acceleration signal is the residual zero point drift (bias) of an accelerometer and its electronics, which is slowly varying due to unknown dependency on temperature, aging and other effects. The measurement system QSAM applies signal modulation by turning the sensor's sensitive axis. This allows the detection of accelerations in a frequency range between 0 and 0.02 Hz with a resolution better than 10"7 g(g=9.81m/s2) and a huge improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio what allows to read the spacecraft's low frequency acceleration environment nearly free of any noise within an arbitrary vibration spectrum. Once the low fre- quency acceleration vector is known at one point the entire field can be calculated on the basis of rigid body kinematics. QSAM is selected to be part of the IML-2 payload (Second International Microgravity Laboratory). A second flight is planned for the Rus- sian free flyer FOTON in fall 1995. In this paper the principle of QSAM is described together with its hardware design and process- ing system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941363. Mir microgravity environment "Microaccéléro- mètre" experiment. Jean-Pierre Granier, CNES; and Pascale Faucher, Europe Informatique. The aim of the * 'Microaccéléromètre" experiment is to perform a microgravity characterization of the Russian MIR space station environment. This experiment has been used in 1992 and 1993 flights to characterize the disturbing sources in the different modules of the station during different activity periods. The sensor head is a three axis piezoelectric accelerometer working in a bandwidth from 0. 1 Hz to 400 Hz. A special post-processing software has been developed by CNES to analyze the different signal classes (continu- ous or transient phenomena). This analysis has provided a lot of knowledge about the MIR microgravity environment. Both time and frequency signatures of significant events recorded in the MIR sta- tion have been successfully identified with this experiment. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941364. Microgravity vibration isolation mount. Bjarni V. Tryggvason, Canadian Space Agency ; S. E. Salcudean, University of British Columbia; W. Y. Stewart, Canadian Space Agency; and N. Parker, University of British Columbia. One of the prime objectives of the international space station pro- gram has been to provide a microgravity laboratory where experi- ments can be done on systems that have a fluid or gaseous phase. Many of these experiments will be directed at material science applications. From the onset of the program, it has been assumed by many that the acceleration environment on the space station would be clean and in the micro-g (ļig) range. It has, however, become accepted over the past few years that the environment will not be as clean as originally hoped for without the use of vibration isolation systems. Indeed, the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) program has recently accepted that isolation systems will be required in order to ensure that the station meets the stated accelera- tion requirements. This decision has been based on analysis of space shuttle acceleration measurements and on analytical modeling of the Space Station Freedom (SSF) and ISSA configurations. Numerous publications are now available that characterize the acceleration environment on the shuttle, the Russian MIR space station and the expected acceleration environment on the SSF and ISSA. In anticipation of the need for isolation systems several groups have pursued the development of microgravity isolation systems with varying degrees of success. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has been active in these developments and has flown a Large Motion Isolation System (LMIM) on several flight campaigns on the NASA KC-135 parabolic flight aircraft over the period 1990 through 1992. This effort to provide a cleaner environment for air- craft- based experiments is nearing completion with an operational system expected to be ready to support experiments this fall. The LMIM system is based on a two stage isolation approach. The coarse stage provides isolation against large amplitude low fre- quency (&lt;1 Hz) departures from ideal free fall, while the fine stage provides isolation against high frequency (&gt;1 Hz) low amplitude vibrations. This two stage system provides an effective means for overcoming the effect of the power and data umbilical that is required to support the experiments on the system. The fine stage is based on a magnetic lévitation (MAGLEV) suspension system developed for robotic applications. This MAGLEV system is quite compact, and has been demonstrated as an effective isolator even 166</page><page sequence="166">941364-941372 in the one-g environment, where the system has to levitate a signifi- cant load. It has been an inherent objective of this work on the KC- 135 system to eventually apply the approach to the vibration prob- lem on the shuttle and ISSA. This paper describes briefly the state of the work directed at developing the space based Microgravity Vibration Isolation Mount (MIM). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941365. Microgravity environment compatibility of payloads analytical concepts and verification. B. Kotzia and D. Eilers, DASA/ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH; L Eckert , Dornier GmbH; H R. Stark, ESA/ESTEC; and R. Wollendorfer, ORS. The ESA study "Microgravity Payload Disturbances" has the general objective to work out and define a guideline for the design and development and the verification of payloads/experiments with respect to adequate and appropriate microgravity environment com- patibility. The guideline shall be made available to the payload contractors and designers as a reference for their planning, design, development, operation and verification of the compatibility of their equipment with the microgravity environment conditions. The aim of the guideline is to establish a comprehensive payload design compliant with the stringent microgravity environment requirements. Therefore the paper addresses the description of com- putational models for the payload disturbance sources which are classified into rotational, translational, acoustical and shock type disturbance sources. The description of these sources includes a suitable interface to the payload and spacecraft. In addition an onground micro-g disturbance source test facility to provide the pay- load/experiment developers with a tool to verify the compliance of the design with the requirements on component and instrument level, is defined and evaluated. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941366.

This paper describes the micro-accelerometer ASTRE, devel- oped as Laboratory Support Equipment of Columbus, to monitor the residual microgravity disturbance level in the very low frequency range. ASTRE will be integrated in the already flown Microgravity/ Measurement Assembly (MMA). The paper recalls the microgravity environment which is required on-board Columbus and shortly describes expected dis- crepancies between the requirements and the predicted, more noisy, situation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941367. AQ601 tiles direct-bond for huygens titan atmo- spheric entry. J. P. Saguet and J. M. Bouilly, Aerospatiale. For the HUYGENS probe heatshield, the direct-bond concept of thermal protection tiles on a structure carrying the mechanical loads was selected. The very complex environment seen during entry through TITAN atmosphere requires a specific logic for the thermal protec- tion mechanical verification, followed by the subsystem qualifica- tion. The suitability of the HUYGENS thermal protection direct-bond on a CFRP sandwich structure for atmospheric entry is being dem- onstrated. It is the result of the capability of the "heated" TPS to withstand the strains generated by thermoelastic phenomena and by the carrying structure deformations (depsite its large structural stiff- ness). 941368. Characterization and modeling of low density TPS materials for recovery vehicles. B. Laub and R. A. S. Beck, Aero- therm Corp. This paper describes characterization and modeling studies of Acusil-I, a moderate density (p=480kg/m3) filled silicone in pheno- lic fiberglass honeycomb, which is an appropriate TPS material for the forward face of a blunt reentry vehicle. Laboratory tests were conducted to verify the fundamental thermophysical, thermochemi- cal, and optical properties of the material and arc plasma experi- ments at representative reentry aerothermal boundary conditions on samples with in-depth thermocouples provided data on material thermal and ablation performance. The paper describes how the lab- oratory and arc plasma data are employed in the development of an accurate thermal/ablation model which can be used confidently for TPS design. 941369. Carbon phenolic ablation testing and analysis for high speed earth return. A. J. Smith, Fluid Gravity Engineering, Ltd.; and E. Mariage and M. Lacoste, SEP. Testing of carbon phenolic heatshield materials suitable for the forward heatshield of a high speed Earth return capsule is addressed. Critical aspects of the testing included thermocouple size, orien- tation and placement, and heat flux calibration to provide accurate data. Post-test examination provides evidence of char and pyrolysis depth, delamination and cracking. Analysis indicates the specific heat capacity has a heating rate dependency, this has been accounted for in the correlation of con- ductivity with temperature. A fissure model to account for delami- nation of the samples needed to be included. 941370. Aeroshell compared design and analysis for Mars penetrators. J. C. Verneuil and J. F. Puech, Dassault. In the frame of preliminary technological investigations for future European Mars landing probes, a study has been performed by Dassault under the supervision of ESTEC on potential thermal protection systems and aeroshell configurations for such penetra- tors. After an extensive trade-off between numerous candidate archi- tectures and technologies, two solutions were more deeply investi- gated for feasibility assessment purposes: -an innovative semi-integrated concept based upon an ablator- protected CFRP cold structure front shield with a C-SiC hot struc- ture decelerator, -a more conventional integrated concept based upon a one-piece ablator-protected CFRP cold structure. 941371. Plasma arc jet testing for thermal protection charac- terization. Timothy K. Risch, Aerotherm Corp. Plasma arc jet test facilities provide a reliable and versatile envi- ronment for materials performance characterization. Although exact simulations of flight conditions are generally not possible in arc test facilities, suitable materials performance tests can be conducted by simulating only a select few performance parameters. Understand- ing the principal ablative mechanisms for a given material class allows one to identify the critical simulation parameters. Predictive thermal models, developed from arc jet data, then can be used for the design of thermal protection systems meeting flight condition requirements. 941372. Finite element simulation of thermal ablation pro- cesses. P. Gerrekens, SamTech; M. Hogge, University of Liege; and D. Pire and J.-M. Bouilly, Aérospatiale Bordeaux. This paper describes the capabilities of a numerical tool dedi- cated to the prediction of one- and two-dimensional (axisymmetric) thermal ablation. This code is capable of simulating surface ablation (oxidation, melting, sublimation) as well as in-depth transforma- tions (pyrolysis). In order to accurately track the boundary recession, an original solution method is used, which is based on a continuously deform- ing finite element grid. Mesh deformation further allows to over- come numerical difficulties such as lack of space discretization accuracy and large shape changes of the ablating structure. Some one- and two-dimensional applications are presented to illustrate the methods and validate the code. 167</page><page sequence="167">941373-941381 941373. SCIAMACHY optical assembly thermal control design. P . Reijneker and A. Deutz , Fokker Space &amp; Systems. SCIAMACHY is a German-Dutch Earth observation instrument which is to fly aboard the Envisat-1 spacecraft. It is an 8 channel spectrometer designed to analyze sunlight which is scattered on higher layers of the atmosphere. Two of the channels perform mea- surements in the Infrared. For these channels a low and stable tem- perature level of the instrument is required (&lt;-20°C) to minimize the impact of IR background radiation on the measurements. Addition- ally, the system requirement on spectral stability requires the varia- tion in thermal gradient to be very small. This paper presents the flow down from system to thermal requirements and gives a ratio- nale for the Thermal Control Sub-system (TCS) design concept which was established to meet these severe requirements. Added to this are some of the analyses results which support the TCS design. The presented TCS design reflects the PDR status. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941376.

Alekseev, Scientific and Industrial Center of Precision Instru- ments. The article is devoted to the problems of joint optimization of mass, power and reliability characteristics of the thermal control system and radio electronic instruments for long term mission spacecraft of high reliability requirements. The instrument operation reliability depending mainly on cooling medium temperature, the problem of optimum temperature level choice in the thermal control system taking into account the maintenance of the reliability required is of great interest. The technique developed allows to choose the optimum instru- ment redundancy rate as well as the optimum temperature level in the thermal control system at minimum values of mass and power characteristics. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941377. Quasi-stationary thermal regime of the "Sodart" telescope detector. A. Abrosimov, V. Khoronenko, M. Kosorotov, M. Fomina, A. Lobanov , A. Paramonov, and M. Parentiev , Scientific Research Institute of Electromechanic s . The results of the long-term (15 days) continuous cryovacuum tests of the "SODART" telescope silicon detector cooler scale- down model are considered. The detector quasi-stationary thermal regime has been attained when simulated the heat fluxes flowing from Earth to cooler radia- tors. The cooler load characteristic is obtained at three values of the detector heat release. The data obtained were stated in terms of the real cooler system showed that with the detector useful load of 300 mW its temperature will not exceed 140 K in all orbit points including the Earth radia- tion belts. The data obtained have been used to calculate the full-scale model structure components temperature. The observation time for the above heat releases at different detector operation temperatures is also estimated. 941378.

Wim Kruidhof Fokker Space &amp; Systems; Giacinto Gianfiglio, ESTEC ; and Wolfgang Pitz, Dornier GmBH. CLUSTER is a scientific space mission envisaging an investiga- tion of the Earth's plasma environment. The paper gives a short overview of the thermal design of CLUS- TER, with emphasis on some special thermal control design fea- tures. In the CLUSTER PFM TB/TV Test, the thermal control concept has been qualified and verified. The paper will describe the first results of the evaluation of the thermal behavior of the CLUSTER PFM and the special design features in particular.

De Parolis and J-C. Ronnet, ESA/ESTEC. BIOBOX is an ESA Incubator Facility able to accommodate a variety of biological experiments in a controlled, predetermined temperature environment. It has been designed as a Payload for the unmanned Russian satellites of the BION, FOTON and RESURS families. The first operative flight took place in December 1992. Some anomalies prevented the mission from being a complete success. A study was initiated by ESA Microgravity Division to identify the causes of the anomalies and to take the needed countermeasures to avoid that they will occur again on future flights. The study was per- formed jointly by ESA/ESTEC and the Industry by means of theo- retical analyses and tests. The results indicated that the main cause of the anomalies was the harsh thermal environment determined by the lack of eclipses during the mission time. However, they also pointed out to the need for refurbishment and design improvements of the original design of the facility. 941380. Space suit life support system packaging factors. I. P. Abramov and R. K. Sharipov, RD&amp;PE Zvezda ; and A. I. Skoog and Nikolaus Herber, DASA Dornier GmbH. One of the most important driving factors in space suit design rests upon the packaging of life support and electrical components within the compartments of a space suit system. The volume and mass of space suits are restricted due to payload constraints, volume constraints inside the airlock, limited hatch diameter, and general bulkiness of the mini spacecraft 'space- suit'. The need for a higher packaging density becomes even more important with the imple- mentation of failure tolerance principles, like redundant compo- nents, or design for minimum risk. Special attention has be paid to the heat balance of motors, pumps, heat exchangers, converters, etc. so as to avoid heat accumulation as well as heat sinks inside the backpack of the suit enclosure. However, from a maintenance point of view, packaging has a certain upper limit in terms of reachability and replaceability of failed or to be maintained components. This may be especially the case for space suit systems of orbiting stations, which are to be maintained on orbit rather than on ground. The purpose of this paper is to review various arrangements of life support subsystems (LSS) equipment both in pressurized and unpressurized backpacks and to summarize both volume and weight packaging factors (PF), so as to contrast the individual packaging factors of space suits. The review uses the experience gained in the development of Russian space suits such as the ORLAN-DMA and its predecessors. Based on this survey, future space suit development can take advantage and use simplified models and guidelines for a prelimi- nary packaging analysis. 941381. Transient aspects of human thermal comfort in the Shuttle EMU. Scott Schneider, Victoria Margiott, and Edward Hodgson, Hamilton Standard Space Systems International, Inc.; and Glenn C. Lutz, NASA. Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) studies have shown that the thermal interaction between the crewperson, liquid cooling garment and EMU thermal management system is highly transient in nature. Recent investigations of these phenomena provide a better understanding which have helped improve thermal comfort in the present system. Analyses show that the key to thermal comfort is understanding the interaction between physiological responses and EMU system thermal transients. A test program was conducted to evaluate the theorized causes of discomfort and proposed corrective actions. Several EMU thermal management related modifications were utilized in the Hubble Space Telescope repair mission where 168</page><page sequence="168">941381-941389 five, two crewperson Extravehicular Activities (EVAs) were con- ducted without any thermal discomfort in a mildly cold environ- ment. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941382. The automatic thermal control system (ATCS) for the EVA space suit. Aram Tz. Elbakyan, ikhael M. Balashov, Ser- gey N. Filipenkov, Gennady M. Glazov, Nelly K. Gnoevaya, Felix V. Kubar, and Rinal Kh. Sharipov, RD&amp;PE Zvezda. This paper presents some approaches to implementation of an automatic thermal control system for the manned space suit. Both the investigation of the space suit thermal conditions per- formed by ZVEZDA and analysis of these conditions during cosmo- nauts' activities at SALUTE-6, SALUTE-7 and MIR space stations have provided a great body of information for ATCS implementa- tion. The paper presents the experimental data on one modification of operating ORLAN-type space suit ATCS model. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941383. Issues in the development of automatic thermal con- trol for portable life support systems. Lee F. Smith, Anthony B. Campbell, Satish S. Nair, and John B. Miles, University of Missouri; and Bruce W. Webbon, NASA. Long-duration, frequent extravehicular activity (EVA) will require automatic thermal control and improved thermomechanical design of portable life support system (PLSS) packs and suits. This paper addresses the control problem in EVA, previous attempts to develop automatic control, and relevant issues in human thermoreg- ulation and is directed toward the development of a generalized computer simulation test bed for the investigation of alternative PLSS control strategies and designs. 941384. Direct-interface fusible heat sink performance tests. W. Curtis Lomax and M. Beth Kader, NASA. A high-fidelity, direct-interface, fusible heat sink for cooling astronauts during extravehicular activity was constructed and tested. The design includes special connectors that allow the coolant loop to be directly connected to the fusible material, in this case water. Aspects tested were start-up characteristics, cooling rate, and perfor- mance during simulated heat loads. A simplified math model was used to predict the effect of increasing the effective thermal conductivity on heat sink freezing rate. An experiment was designed to measure the effective thermal conductivity of a water/aluminum foam system, and full gravity tests were conducted to compare the freezing rates of water and water/foam systems. This paper discusses the results of these efforts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941385. Thermal modeling for design evaluation of extrave- hicular mobility unit heat pipe thermal management unit. J. W. Galate, Lockheed Engineering &amp; Sciences Co. This paper describes the thermal modeling phase of a research and development effort to provide a low weight and volume thermal management unit (TMU) for an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU). An overview of prior work discusses design and lab testing of two prototype units which combine heat pipes and a wax-filled heat sink to reject heat from the EMU. Modeling objectives, initial results, enhancements, and final results are presented. Results demonstrate how the TMU functions as a regenerative heat sink as it responds to metabolic and environmental thermal loads while providing astronaut thermal comfort. 941386. An advanced monitoring, control and display mod- ule for an underwater portable life support system. Joseph R. Lavelle, NASA; Daniel Curti, DeAnza; and Craig VonWaaden, Bionetics Corp. An Advanced Control and Display Module has been developed for an Underwater Portable Life Support System. The system archi- tecture may be applicable for future EVA applications. The Module employs a Single Chip Microcontroller, an Electroluminescent Dis- play, and an Operator Control Panel. The Module automatically controls the amount of oxygen in the diving mixture as a function of depth. Predive and postdive checkout, present diving status, and emergency procedures are all available through the display. 941387. Pathogenic viruses in space: indicators and risks in closed space environments. Gail Brion, University of Colorado ; Charles P. Gerba, University of Arizona; and JoAnn Silverstein, University of Colorado. Astronauts working in space for extended periods of time will be in a closed environment where both air and water are recycled. As the lengths of missions increase, the astronauts are likely to be at greater risk for viral infection by consumption of recycled water and air. In order to minimize the risk of infection and assure mission suc- cess, indicators of the viral quality of recycled water and air will have to be determined. The indicators chosen will depend upon many factors arising from the fields of engineering, public health, virology, and infectious disease. Moreover, selection of viral indica- tors must address the unavoidable mixing of recycled air and water and the pathogens they contain. This paper is a discussion defining viral quality indicators for potable recycled water and air that reflect the behavior of viruses in a closed, multimedia, space environment. The applicability of indicators currently used on earth are consid- ered for use in space. Several viral indicators are proposed for use in monitoring the risks anticipated, and the idea of indicator seeding at various points in the closed environment is presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941388. Evaluation of methods for remediating biofilms in spacecraft potable water systems. John R. Schultz, David T. Flan- agan, Rebekah J. Bruce, and M. Helen Hüls, KRUG; and Duane L. Pierson, and Richard L. Sauer, NASA. Controlling microbial growth and biofilm formation in space- craft water- distribution systems is necessary to protect the health of the crew. Methods to decontaminate the water system in flight may be needed to support long-term missions. We evaluated the ability of iodine and ozone to kill attached bacteria and remove bio- films formed on stainless steel coupons. The biofilms were devel- oped by placing the coupons in a manifold attached to the effluent line of a simulated spacecraft water-distribution system. After bio- films were established, the coupons were removed and placed in a treatment manifold in a separate water treatment system where they were exposed to the chemical treatments for various periods. Disin- fection efficiency over time was measured by counting the bacteria that could be recovered from the coupons using a sonication and plate count technique. Scanning electron microscopy was also used to determine whether the treatments actually removed the biofilm. The results show 25 mg/L of iodine, 250 mg/L of iodine, and 2.3 mg/L of ozone all effectively inactivated bacteria in the biofilm. However, none of these treatments could remove the biofilm that had attached to the stainless-steel surface. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941389. Evaluation of an instrument to monitor microbial contamination of recovered water. Gordon Snyder, GSC Technol- ogies, Inc.; Jarrod D. O'Leary, Orbital Sciences Corp.; Barry H. Pyle, Montana State Univ.; Monsi C. Roman, NASA; and Silvia Minton, ION Electronics. NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has an interest in an automated in-line monitor that can detect the presence of micro- bial contamination in recovered water. Ideally, this system should also be able to identify and enumerate the microbial contaminant. The Viable Microbial Monitor (VM2) is based on conductance microbiology which depends on the well documented ability of microorganisms to change the electrochemical properties of their growth medium during incubation. The VM2 is intended for the rapid detection of bacterial or fungal contamination in water and other samples. 169</page><page sequence="169">941389-941394 From October 1992 to July 1993, NASA-MSFC sponsored a Microbial In-line Monitor (MIM) study to evaluate the VM2 for its ability to detect ten microorganism species (9 bacteria and 1 yeast) recovered from Water Recovery Tests (WRT) conducted at MSFC. These WRT isolates may represent the microbes that have potential to contaminate a water recovery system. Three temperatures (30, 35 and 40°C) and three media (Plate Count Broth [HPC], 1/2 strength Tryptic Soy Broth [1/2TSB] and R2A Broth) were used for the eval- uation. The final outcome of this study was to select 3 of the 10 microbes for further study. Results showed that Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus epider- midis, and Corynebacterium xerosis gave the greatest overall response. Detection time ranged from approximately 5.4 hours (K. oxytoca) to 15.8 hours (C. xerosis). The change in conductance ranged from 143 pSiemens (K. oxytoca) to 20 pSiemens (C. xero- sis). For each microbial species selected, reproducible results were obtained more rapidly than that obtained by conventional assays. Significantly different conductance growth patterns were observed which may permit subsequent identification. Data and graphs representing microbial detection, growth rates, growth patterns, and reproducibility will be presented. In addition, thoughts on future research and applications will be considered. 941390. Rapid, direct methods for enumerating viable bacte- ria in spacecraft water systems - A review. Barry H. Pyle, Gor- don A. Mcfeters, Susan C. Broadaway, and Feipeng P. Yu, Montana State Univ.; and Ajaib Singh, Milwaukee Department of Health. To determine the microbiological quality of water for potable and other purposes, there is a need for rapid methods to enumerate viable bacteria. This is of particular importance for the proposed water recovery systems planned for the United States Space Station, in which waste waters including hygiene water and urine will be reclaimed for potable use. Existing microbiological culture methods are limited by the time taken to obtain results and because it is not possible to detect the total microbial populations by these methods. We have been investigating direct microscopic methods which detect individual bacterial cells. Fluorogenic compounds are used which are taken up by active cells, permitting a direct assessment of physiological activity. The methods are being adapted for use with membrane filtration which permits concentration of small numbers of cells from large volumes of water. Procedures for direct examination of cells growing on surfaces as biofilms have also been devised. Stained samples are examined by epifluorescent micros- copy, a tedious technique which can be automated using computer- ized image analysis systems. The results of these methods are obtained within a few hours, compared to the 2-7 days required for total viable bacterial counts using traditional agar plating methods. Some rapid methods are reviewed, and rapid techniques for physio- logical assessment compared with traditional methods. Prospects for developing rapid methods to detect specific bacteria, combined with physiological assessment, are discussed. 941391. Depletion of biocidal iodine in a stainless steel water system. Paul D. Mudgett, David T. Flanagan, and John R. Schultz , KRUG ; and Richard L. Sauer, NASA. Iodine depletion in a simulated water storage tank and distribu- tion system was examined to support a larger research program aimed at developing disinfection methods for spacecraft potable water systems. The main objective of this study was to determine the rate of iodine depletion with respect to the surface area of the stainless steel components contacting iodinated water. Two model configurations were tested. The first, representing a storage and dis- tribution system, consisted of a stainless steel bellows tank, a coil of stainless steel tubing and valves to isolate the components. The second represented segments of a water distribution system and con- sisted of eight individual lengths of 21-6-9 stainless tubing similar to that used in the Shuttle Orbiter. The tubing has a relatively high and constant surface area to volume ratio (S/V) and the bellows tank a lower and variable S/V. The test apparatus was cleaned and filled with a 10mg/L solution prepared with distilled-deionized water. Sampling from the tank, coil and the series of tubes was performed periodically, and the major iodine species were monitored to deter- mine the rate of decay of iodine and its fate in the system. Results of this study show that the iodine demand of stainless steel was significant. Decay rates were higher than anticipated in tubing that had not been previously exposed to iodine. The iodine (I2) concentration in the tank contents decreased to less than lmg/L in 10 weeks, whereas none was detected in water from the tubes after 1 week. Also, trace metals were measured in the samples by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and found to increase with contact time. A subsequent attempt to passivate the inside surface of the tubing via a 4-hour soak with 30 mg/L iodinated water reduced the rate but did not eliminate iodine loss. Ramifications of these findings to the current Shuttle potable water system and the design of spacecraft water systems in general are dis- cussed. 941392. GC/MS and CE methods for the analysis of trace organic acids in reclaimed water supplies. Mark E. Homan, Paul D. Mudgett, and John R. Schultz, KRUG; and Richard L. Sauer, NASA. The objective of this study was to investigate combining GC/MS and CE methods to allow sub-mg/L levels of organic acids to be determined in various water samples. This study also served as a basis for evaluating these instruments for in-flight spacecraft water- quality monitoring and to help determine the modifications needed to convert terrestrial hardware for use in microgravity environments. This paper reports on current GC/MS and CE method development and data generated from some recent spacecraft-related water sam- ples. Plans for further method development are also discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941393. An improved oxidation reactor for total organic car- bon measurements. Richard S. Hutte, Richard D. Godec, and Kevin J. O ' Neill , Sievers Instruments, Inc. Closed-loop water recycle systems for future manned space mis- sion will require sensitive analytical methods to determine the qual- ity of the water and insure the health and safety of the crew. As part of a NASA-funded study, we have been investigating techniques for the measurement of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in water for use on the Space Station. The prototype system developed employs a membrane-based conductometric CO2 sensor which provides a gravity-independent means for measuring the amount of CO2 pro- duced from the oxidation of organic compounds. Recently, we have been developing a system for the oxidation of organic compounds that does not require the use of chemical oxidizing agents. The rea- gentless oxidation reactor uses a combination of electrolytic and photolytic oxidation to convert organic compounds to CO2. A new reactor design which incorporates a larger surface area anode and active removal of hydrogen has been tested and the oxidation effi- ciency for a range of organic compounds determined. Oxidation efficiencies as high as 96% to 99% can be obtained at concentrations up to -50 ppm C, even for difficult to oxidize organic compounds such as urea. The samples were pre-acidified and the reactor oper- ated at approximately 60°C. The reactor produced stable oxidation without any significant decrease in the efficiency of the reactor over time, as was observed in previous reactor designs. 941394. Space Station: a key step in developing life support systems for space exploration. Albert F. Behrend, Jr., NASA; and Richard P. Reysa, Boeing Defense and Space Group. Future human space exploration missions present significant challenges for life support system (LSS) development. These life support systems will require incorporation of regenerative technolo- gies to reduce or eliminate expendables and be low risk, demonstrat- ing high reliability and long-term performance capability. A regen- erative LSS for Space Station is a key step toward meeting these future space exploration requirements. 170</page><page sequence="170">941394-941397 In the development of the Space Station regenerative LSS, the challenges have been both technical and budgetary. Currently, the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) program will consist of three Phases. Phase I will be MIR/Shuttle Orbiter flights with United States (US) crews attending to the various US flight experi- ments on-board the MIR. Phase II will consist mostly of Russian launched modules and the United States (US) Laboratory module. Phase III will launch the US Habitat module to implement US regenerative LSS. Phase II will rely on Russian regenerative sys- tems and Phase III will add Water Recovery Management (WRM) system closure in 2001 and Air Revitalization (AR) system partial closure in 2002. Future human space exploration budgetary realities suggest that step-wise evolution of Space Station LSS technologies is the most prudent approach to achieve a successful regenerative LSS, rather than embarking on totally new regenerative LSS technologies devel- opment. Space Station regenerative LSS implementation will pro- vide experience for reducing logistics, validating low-gravity hard- ware operation, extending component life, evaluating reduced- gravity fluid mechanics, understanding system integration issues and improving system efficiencies. The resulting LSS can also be key to evolving to an integrated physical/chemical/biological life support system to achieve more efficient closure. Additionally, regenerative LSS evolution is synergistic with Space Station LSS logistics reduction and reliability improvement objectives. NASA is currently implementing a comprehensive technology development strategic plan to advance regenerative LSS technology. It is suggested that this plan incorporate a step- wise evolution using the Space Station regenerative LSS as the baseline for this evolu- tion. For example, the selected Space Station regenerative WRM system has a low technology risk design, but this design has a signif- icant logistics penalty for filter and sorbent bed replacement. Tech- nology advancements to reduce or eliminate expendables by devel- oping technology for regenerating sorbent beds and filters are possi- ble. Complimenting these near-term improvements should be regen- erative hardware evolution that includes development of solid waste recovery technology providing complete system closure by recover- ing metabolic and processor byproducts and food wastes. Both physical/chemical and biological processes are the candidates for this evolutionary step. This paper provides a brief discussion of the Space Station regen- erative closed-loop LSS development history, including the ISSA configuration, and a preview of NASA's overall life sciences research technology development strategic plan as it relates to regenerative life support. 941395. Life characterization of enhanced solid amine CO2 sorbents. Joseph Genovese and Timothy Nalette, Hamilton Stan- dard Space Systems International, Inc. In 1991, Hamilton Standard initiated an independent research and development program to enhance the performance characteris- tics of solid amine based regenerative CO2 removal systems. A solid amine based system had been selected by NASA/JSC for Extended Duration Orbiter missions. As a result of this research effort, two promising new solid amine candidates, designated HSC'u+ and HSG, were identified. Bench scale testing indicated that these for- mulations provided 25% to 33% greater initial cyclic capacity when compared to the baseline HSC solid amine sorbent. This paper reports on comparative life testing of HSC, HSC'u+ and HSG. The solid amine sorbents were exposed to accelerated life testing with laboratory air under controlled temperature and flow conditions. At various time intervals over a duration of approxi- mately 12,700 hours, the solid amine candidates were packed into a subscale reactor which was designed for evaluating cyclic and equilibrium CO2 capacities under various operating conditions and subjected to a uniform series of performance tests. Life exposure testing is continuing. To date, the HSG formula- tion, which provides 25% initial performance margin over HSC, was found to exhibit almost three times better life characteristics than HSC or HSC'u+, thus offering more stable operation and improved performance for extended missions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941396. Molecular sieve CO2 removal systems for future mis- sions: test results and alternative designs. M. C. Kimble and M. S. Nacheff -Benedict, AlliedSignal Aerospace; and L. A. Dall- Bauman and M. R. Kallberg, NASA Johnson Space Center. Reversible adsorption on zeolite molecular sieve material allows selective removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from spacecraft air with- out the use of expendables. The four-bed molecular sieve (4BMS) CO2 removal subsystem chosen for use on space station is based on proven skylab technology and provides continuous CO2 removal from the cabin atmosphere and concentration for further processing downstream or venting overboard. A 4BMS subsystem has also been chosen to remove CO2 from air in the systems integration research facility (SIRF) at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). After installaion in the SIRF in 1992, the subsystem underwent extensive testing in which cycle time, pro- cess air flow rate, and process air inlet CO2 composition were var- ied. In order to obtain performance data required for integration, the subsystem was operated under both nominal and off-nominal condi- tions. Results of this testing are presented. For future missions, alternative subsystem designs and opera- tional modes for a molecular sieve-based CO2 removal subsystem may be more desirable than the baseline 4BMS subsystem, depend- ing on mission drivers. In addition, development of new adsorbent materials may result in significantly lower power and weight penal- ties for a molecular sieve CO2 removal system. Alternative designs to the existing 4BMS configuration, which utilize existing hardware components and were considered during the space station redesign effort, are presented and discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941397. An integrated approach to bioreactor technology development for a regenerative life support primary water pro- cessor. Maurena S. Nacheff -Benedict, AlliedSignal Aerospace ; Gary, H. Kumagai, AlleidSignal Aerospace ; Glenn E. Petrie, Allied- Signal Research and Technology; Randolph W. Schweickart and Carl D. McFadden, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace ; and Marybeth A. Edeen, NASA. Development of bioreactor technology for a regenerative life support primary water processor is ongoing by a team, composed of NASA and major aerospace companies, using a concurrent inte- grated approach. This approach consists of performing small-scale reactor experimental investigations, large- scale experimental studies, and computer modeling efforts on both the bioprocessor subsystem level and on the integrated water recovery system level. Bench-top experimental studies are aimed at developing an understanding of the biological process and the effect of key param- eters on the process, determining the operational envelope for the regenerative life support application, and addressing process control issues. The large-scale experimental studies, in which a bioproces- sor is one subsystem of an overall water recovery system, address the full-scale system integration and operational issues. Two biolog- ical reactors, the trickling filter bioreactor (TFB) and the immobi- lized cell bioreactor (ICB), are currently under test as primary water processors using a real waste water feed in the Hybrid Regenerative Water Recovery System (HRWRS) at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Two levels of computer modeling efforts are also ongoing. A detailed bioreactor performance model is being developed in which the bioprocess phenomena is being explored from first principles. This model will be validated with the data from the experimental investigations and will then be used to evaluate alternative bio- processor configurations and operating regimes. Simplified reactor models which will be used in a water recovery system model are also under development. This system model will be used to trade off various subsystem technologies and system configurations as a function of various mission drivers. The purpose of this paper is to 171</page><page sequence="171">941397-941404 further describe this integrated team approach to bioreactor technol- ogy development and to discuss some of the initial results which have been obtained. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941398. Vapor phase catalytic ammonia reduction. M. T. Flynn, NASA. This paper discusses the development of a Vapor Phase Catalytic Ammonia Reduction (VPCAR) teststand and the results of an exper- imental program designed to evaluate the potential of the technology as a water purification process. In the experimental program the technology is evaluated based upon product water purity, water recovery rate, and power consumption. The experimental work demonstrates that the technology pro- duces high purity product water and attains high water recovery rates at a relatively high specific power consumption. The experi- mental program was conducted in three phases. In phase I and Igepon™ soap and water mixture was used to evaluate the perfor- mance of an innovative Wiped-Film Rotating-Disk evaporator and associated demister. In phase II a phenol-water solution was used to evaluate the performance of the high temperature catalytic oxida- tion reactor. In phase III a urine analog was used to evaluate the per- formance of the combined distillation/oxidation functions of the processor. 941399. Particle size effect on supercritical water oxidation- polystyrene beads. John W. Fisher, NASA Ames Research Center; and Martin A. Abraham, University of Tulsa. Advanced space life support systems, especially systems that include growing plants to produce food, require the recovery of resources -primarily carbon dioxide and water - from various hydro- carbon wastes. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) of wates is one of several prossible techniques for oxidizing waste organics to recover the carbon dioxide and water. Supercritical water oxidation has the advantages of fast kinetics, complete oxidation, and the min- imization of undesirable side products. However, the SCWO pro- cess requires further development before the process can be imple- mented in space life systems. One of the SCWO development needs is in the area of destruction of insuluble solids - such as inedible bio- mass or human wastes. Insoluble solids have to be introduced into a SCWO reactor as particles, and it can be expected that the particle size of the solids will affect the rate of reaction. Once the effects of particle size are understood, then the requirements for grinding or other preparation of feed solids before introduction into the reactor can be defined. To study the effects of particle size an experimental effort was begun at NASA Ames Research Center. Particles of poly- styrene bead ranging in diameter from 3.4 pm to 220 pm were tested. A significant particle size effect on the rate of reaction was measured at 720°F. 941400. Regenerative trace contaminant control by hydro- phobic molecular sieves. Bernard Lledos and Johannes Witt, ESTEC. At present, most of the trace contaminants in a spacecraft are controlled by adsorption on activated charcoal filters which, after saturation, have to be exchanged. For a longer duration mission, a regenerative trace contaminant control could practically eliminate the need for resupply of adsorbents. This study investigated the possibility of using hydrophobic zeo- lite molecular sieves for regenerative trace contaminant control. In small scale laboratory tests, different types of pelleted zeolite sam- ples have been exposed to a model atmosphere containing represen- tative trace contaminants. Co-adsorption capacities have been deter- mined and the effect of parameters such as pellet size and shape, humidity level and flow rate have been studied. On the basis of this study, a regenerative trace contaminant adsorber applying two dif- ferent molecular sieves is proposed. 941401. Electrochemical method for a desalted water mineral composition correction in spacecrafts water supply systems. Y. E. Sinyak, V. A. Gromyko, N. M. Krivobok, and A. A. Ananikova, Institute for Biomedical Problems. The results of the studies of two method carried out for water sat- uration with the trace elements are proposed. In the first method the water saturation is realized due to the adsorption equilibrium that sets on the sorbent surface and into the solution. This method has a resourse of 1 ,6 1/g. In the other method the electric current using makes possible both to control the process of the saturation and to increase the mineralizeos resource in 10 times as compared with the first one due to the deeper ions extraction from the charcoal surface. The data obtained may be taken as a basis for the development of the adequate technology and construction. 941402. Development status of two-phase heat transport technology in ESA/ESTEC. Wolfgang Supper, ESA/ESTEC. ESA/ESTEC funded two-phase heat transport activities for spacecraft thermal control started in the mid 1980's. A number of different two-phase loops, using either a mechanical pump or driven by a capillary pumped evaporator, were designed, assembled and tested successfully in the past years. The transported power levels were from a few hundred watts up to 10 kW over distances of some meters up to several tens of meters. The working fluid was either freon or ammonia. Within ESA's Technology Demonstration Program (TDPI), a first two-phase experiment (TPX) for flight as a GAS-payload on the US Shuttle was designed and has been successfully flown on STS-60 in February 1994. The article will present the ESA/ESTEC funded two-phase heat transport activities undertaken in the last years, namely the develop- ment of a mechanically pumped and capillary pumped two- phase heat transport system, and discuss the different activities currently performed: • the definition of an engineering model of a capillary and a mechanically pumped two-phase loop, • the development of a capillary pumped two-phase loop bread- board for the thermal control of the laser head of an earth observa- tion instrument, requiring the removal of up to 230W with a required temperature stability of +/-1K, using radiators which are subjected to a changing thermal environment, • the development of a high-efficiency, low-pressure drop two- phase condenser. Furthermore, results of the first European in-orbit demonstration of two-phase heat transport technology will be shortly discussed. 941404. In-orbit demonstration of two-phase heat transport technology: TPX/G557 flight results. A. A. M. Delil and J. F. Heemskerk, NLR; M. Dubois and S. van Oost, S ABC A; and W. Sup- per and R. Aceti, ESA/ESTEC. Mechanically pumped two-phase heat transport systems are cur- rently developed to meet the high power and long transport distance requirements of thermal management systems for future large space- craft. Capillary pumped systems are being developed for applications with special requirements concerning microgravity disturbance level, temperature stability and controllability. As two-phase flow and heat transfer in a low-gravity environ- ment is expected to differ from terrestrial behavior, two-phase heat transport system technology has to be demonstrated in orbit. There- fore the Dutch-Belgian Two- Phase experiment TPX has been developed within the ESA In-Orbit Technology Demonstration Pro- gram. TPX is a two-phase ammonia system, flown in the 5ft3 gaseous nitrogen filled Get Away Special canister G557, aboard STS-60. The system, being a reduced-scale capillary pumped two-phase loop with a flat and a cylindrical capillary evaporator and an actively con- trolled reservoir (for loop temperature setpoint control), also included down-scaled versions of mechanically pumped two-phase 172</page><page sequence="172">941404-941412 loop components: multichannel condensers and vapor quality sen- sors, plus a controllable 3-way valve for control exercises. The objectives of the autonomously running experiment and its actual flight configuration (with own power supply, data handling and experiment control) are presented. Preliminary results of the flight data analysis are compared with pre- launch predictions and test results. 941405. Experiment of two-phase flow loop thermal control system using test rocket. H. Yamada, T. Nakamura, and S. Kato, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. This paper describes results of the thermal-hydraulic perfor- mance experiment system (THYPES) of the two-phase flow loop thermal control system using the test rocket which can maintain a gravity level of lO^G for about six minutes. Feasibility study of this system had been conducted for loading into an experiment module of test rocket TR-IA No. 3. In 1991, engineering model of the exper- iment system was designed and manufactured in order to investigate its function, performance, and endurance against launching condi- tions. In 1992, flight model of the experiment system was designed and manufactured. The following tests were conducted so as to ensure the capability and compatibility of THYPES; functional test, performance test, environmental test, and interface tests between the experiment system and rocket avionics section. The experiment was performed on September 17, 1993 and the results are evolved. 941407. Design and investigation of methods of regulation of loop heat pipes for terrestrial and space applications. Yury F. Maidanik, Yury G. Fershtater, and Nikolay N. Solodovnik, Russian Academy of Sciences. Loop heat pipes (LHP) are controllable heat transfer devices that may operate in different regimes. When there is a possibility of redistribution of liquid between the evaporator and condenser, the regime of autoregulation is realized. Such a regime produces a per- formance characteristic of a specific form and makes it possible to implement control over an LHP temperature within a certain range of variation of heat load by means of corresponding selection of the constructive parameters. Active control is more reliable and precise. It is realized by means of thermal action on the returning flow of a working liquid. It was shown in the experiments that active control provides practically constant temperature within the control range. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941408. Deleterious effects of non-condensible gas during capillary pumped loop startup. D. Antoniuk and J. Pohne r, TRW Space &amp; Electronics Group. Deprimes occurring in capillary pumped loops (CPLs) with small-diameter evaporator pumps (&lt;16 mm) were examined analyti- cally and experimentally. The proposed deprime mechanism advanced by this paper is nucleation of a pressurized vapor bubble that can blow through the evaporator wick and lead to immediate CPL deprime or unstable operation with a likelihood of deprime at a later time. This failure mechanism is exacerbated by the presence of anon-condensible gas species like hydrogen in the ammonia working fluid. Use of a robust startup evaporator to empty the nor- mal vapor spaces of the remaining CPL evaporators prior to startup is identified as the most effective method for obviating this failure mechanism and ensuring reliable CPL operation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941409. Experimental study of nitrogen fixation system in a closed ecological system. Masatoshi Tsuji, Toru Numaguchi, Shigeo Uyama, and Katsutoshi Kikuchi, Toyo Engineering Corp.; and Keiji Nitta, and Akira Ashida, Institute for Environmental Sci- ence. Nitrogen Fixation Systems (NFS) suitable for plant cultivation in a closed environment have been studied through experimental verification. The system is composed of physico-chemical processes only. Nitrogen gas and water are fed into the system as raw materi- als, and ammonia and ammonium nitrate solution are produced as final products, which are utilized as main fertilizers in plant cultiva- tion. Each elemental chemical process in NFS is selected with regard to unique design criteria concerning safety, energy effective- ness, compactness and reliability. An experimental apparatus for important unit processes has been made for the purpose of verifying process data. A detailed design for nitrogen fixation facilities, planned for construction as the first Japanese CELSS laboratory, was carried out. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941410. Preliminary studies on the performance and behav- ior of MELISSA photoheterotrophic compartment. Joan Albiol, Blandine Gicqueau, and Christophe Lasseur, ESTEC. Successful implementation of the MELISSA loop requires the optimum performance of each of its compartments. Preliminary studies on the behavior of the photoheterotrophic compartment have been performed. The previously suggested strains have been tested for growth on the carbon and nitrogen sources expected to be components of the influent. The results indicate that of the organisms tested Rs.rubrum should become the organism of choice for the photoheterotrophic compartment while R. Capsulatus is more appropriate for the photo- autotrophic anaerobic compartment. Biomass analyses, determination of yields and growth rates have also been performed in the preliminary batch and continuous cul- tures. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941411. Model based predictive control of MELLISA photo- bioreactors. Steady state determination. C. Binois, Matra Mar- coni Space; Ch. Lasseur, European Space Agency; J. F. Cornet, Université Blaise Pascal; and D. Doyle, European Space Agency. Mathematical modeling and control of artificial ecosystems, such as MELISSA, require first the study of physical and biological char- acteristics in optimal and limiting conditions. Following the previ- ous determination of the stoichiometric equations (Spirulina com- partment) and regarding the two phototrophic compartments of MELISSA (Rhodospirillaceae and Spirulina), we have first to focus our control study on the growth kinetics for the light source. In this paper, we recall the theoretical equations of microbial growth kinetics and emphasize the problem of the light transfer in a photobioreactor. We present their adaptations to our pilot plant taking into account technological and biological specifics (lamp spectrum, working illuminated volume, growth rate,...). We then develop the principles and structure of the control system and describe tests of both the hardware and software for several steady state configurations. Preliminary results from our pilot plant (Spirulina) are presented, and finally advantages and weaknesses of this approach are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941412. Microalgae culturing reactor for carbon dioxide elimination and oxygen recovery - CO2 fixation activity under various irradiation cycle. Tadashi Adachi, EBARA Corp.; and Akiko Miya, EBARA Research Co., Ltd. We carried out a series of experiments on the culturing of micro- algae with the intention of eliminating carbon dioxide and recover- ing oxygen. The reactor used for culturing photosynthetic algae (photobioreactor) was manufactured on trial; we cultured C. ellip- soidea C-27 in this photobioreactor by passing air containing about 1% CO2 at a constant irradiation intensity of 1.6 W/reactor. The daily irradiation time was set for 8, 12 and 16 hours. The findings showed that the shorter the irradiation, time, the longer it took to ini- tiate growth (the growth lag phase increased), and the maximum number of cells obtained differed as well. On the other hand, the maximum growth rate remained almost unchanged, and the energy required for growth was accumulated in the cells regardless of the average daily dose of irradiation. 173</page><page sequence="173">941412-941417 As with the maximum growth rate, the maximum CO2 fixation rate was not influenced significantly by the irradiation conditions, although the chlorophyll per unit amount was most active at a daily irradiation dose of 8 hours. The amount of photoenergy given showed a correlation with the maximum amount of CO2 fixation in 12- and 16-hour daily irradiation. However, the amount of CO2 fixa- tion per unit amount of photoenergy given in 8-hour daily irradiation was less than in 12- and 16-hour daily irradiation. When the daily dose was reduced to 1/2 in continuous irradiation, we did not observe any decreases in the grow rate or in the maxi- mum number of cells obtained using air containing 5% CO2. This indicated that it is CO2 concentration that determines the amount of photoenergy required for cell growth. In addition, when the dose was reduced to 1/2 in continuous irra- diation, the growth lag phase was much shorter, but the maximum photosynthesis was less active than in the 12-hour daily- irradiation experiment at an equivalent daily dose. The daily CO2 fixation amount was somewhat greater in the 12-hour irradiation experiment. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941413. Bioregenerative systems based on unicellular algae. G. I. Meleshko and Ye. Y a. Shepelev, Institute of Biomedical Prob- lems. A bioregenerative system model based on photosynthesis of uni- cellular algae has been created and studied. It includes man and microorganisms. The regeneration of substances vital for man in the model achieves 90%. Besides regeneration of atmosphere, water and partly food, a series of secondary functions is performed by the sys- tem. All functional characteristics were stabilized either at once or after some transitory period, and were close to the control. The envi- ronment formed in the system met biological needs of man. The system model is a transitory stage on the way of creating sys- tems, more complex in structure and closure degree. It has a practi- cal significance as a bioregenerative system and may be used in present-day astronautics practice. 941414. Design for low microgravity disturbances illustrated at the spacelab facility NIZEMI. L. Eckert , Ch. Pütz, and R. Trei- chel, Dornier GmbH. On behalf of the German Space Agency, DARA, the spacelab facility NIZEMI (slow rotating centrifuge microscope) was devel- oped for IML-2 mission in July 1994. The facility permits the inves- tigation of samples under various levels of acceleration. Primary uti- lization of the facility during the IML-2 mission is for the investiga- tion of samples in the field of gravitational biology. For observation purposes two optical units, a microscope and a macroscope, and the infrastructure for thermal control of the sam- ples has been installed on a centrifuge turntable. The acceleration can be adjusted at levels between 10"3 g and 1.5g. The rotating centrifuge itself and several moveable items like fans and stages, which are attached on the centrifuge turntable, may affect the microgravity environment of spacelab. The equipment accommodated on the centrifuge turntable does not allow a design for a uniform mass distribution. Resulting unbalances must be com- pensated by suitable balancing weights. The paper describes the design of NIZEMI for low microgravity disturbances. The different mechanisms of NIZEMI are outlined and the impacts on the microgravity environment are analyzed. For vertification of the microgravity requirements for NIZEMI micro dynamic measurements have been performed on a special test facility at Dornier. The capabilitys of the test facility are described. Test results of Nizemi are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941415. Microgravity measurement assembly - MM A. Ingo Gerhard, ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH; and Yves De Coulon, CSEM Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, Inc. The Microgravity Measurement Assembly (MMA) is a modular, centralized measurement facility for determination of disturbance accelerations aboard spacecrafts. The system is currently designed for Spacelab applications and demonstrated it's full functionality for the first time during the German Spacelab Mission D-2 in April/May 1993. MMA has detected, during D-2 ground and on-orbit measure- ments, accelerations in different locations e.g. close to microgravity sensitive experiments inside Spacelab racks, as well as on other microgravity interesting positions like centrifuges, using rack mounted sensors. Also the environment inside the cabin could be measured using two mobile sensor assemblies. These mobile sensor assemblies were operated by the astronauts and could be placed at any suitable location within the Spacelab cabin. Thus, together with the on-line connected ground station, the sys- tem was able to monitor the microgravity environment on-board D-2. MMA uses a set of modular components which allow for differ- ent on-board configurations. The current maximum number of seven triaxial sensor packages was split for D-2 in four rack mounted assemblies, two mobile ones and completed by an impact hammer to support a transfer function experiment. A new generation of micromechanical acceleration detectors has been used. The advantage of these accelerometers was their small size and weight allowing for installation nearly at all locations inside Spacelab racks and in the cabin. The usage of these new sensors gave MMA additionally to the main task, to measure microgravity disturbances on-board Spacelab, the character of a technology experiment. The technology aspect was increased by an impact hammer inducing defined forces on predefined locations inside the cabin. This unit was connected to MMA as mentioned above and used together with the MMA sensors in order to support determina- tion of structural transfer functions on-ground and in- orbit. All data were collected and formatted by the central MMA com- puter and sent to the ground. On ground the MMA Ground Station processed the data on-line to support other experiments and the transfer function determination. Thus, for the first time, synchronized and comparable precise acceleration data were available in real time on ground for on- line judgement of the microgravity environment desired for experiment success, offering the possibility e.g. of experiment repetition in case of excessive g-disturbances. Furthermore MMA allows for immedi- ate feedback to the crew concerning the microgravity effects of their own body movements with the aim to improve crew training towards lower crew induced disturbances. The MMA on-board system and Ground Station is planned to be utilized for further Spacelab Missions and in modified configuration also for MIR. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941416. Microgravity payload vibration isolation system development. P. H. Bastin and. D. L. Edberg, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. The objective of this paper is to present results of MDA's pay- load vibration isolation system research and development program. A unique isolation system with passive or active capabilities designed to provide isolation down to 10~6 g was developed and tested in our 1-g testbed under simulated microgravity conditions. Fluid and electrical umbilicais are also included in the system. The established isolation system performance requirements were met and the testbed data were used to refine our analytical models for predicting flight performance. Simulations using an updated Space Station configuration showed that the payload microgravity require- ment can be met by upgrading the hardware from laboratory to flight tolerances and improving the control system design. The next step is to flight test the systems verified in 1 g on the STS/SPACEHAB using a middeck locker size development unit. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941417. Analysis of space shuttle acceleration data. Bjarni V. Tryggvason, Canadian Space Agency. 174</page><page sequence="174">941417-941423 The flight of Skylab in 1973 provided the first significant oppor- tunity to perform experiments in the near free-fall conditions in orbital flight. Initial expectations were that the free-fall conditions would provide acceleration related loads on an experiment in the micro-g (jug) range and many experiments flown on the U.S. space shuttle and the Russian MIR space station have been designed to take advantage of this condition. However, with experience it has become increasingly clear that large space platforms such as those mentioned do not provide true jig acceleration levels. The effects of atmospheric drag, gravity gradient effects and rotations of the spacecraft limit the quasi-steady accelerations, from DC to approxi- mately 0.01 Hz, to values of the order of several jig's. At frequen- cies above 0.01 Hz disturbances generated on the spacecraft from activities such as attitude control, thermal control, power system, crew activities and experiment operations, produce RMS accelera- tion levels of the order of 100 jig broadband, with amplifications at natural frequencies of the spacecraft resulting in accelerations up to milli-g levels. This less than ideal acceleration environment has become recognized over the past several years and concern over the implied environment on the Space Station Freedom (SSF) and now the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) has lead to a concerted effort to quantify and understand the acceleration environment and the sources of disturbances to the environment. Over the past several years, a very large amount of data has been collected on several shuttle flights and recently on the MIR space station and published in various forms. While much effort has been expended on summarizing the acceleration environment, analysis approaches and the presentation of results varies, an is not always done in a format that is easy to interpret and use to estimate the potential effect of the environment on specific experiments. This paper presents analysis of some of the space shuttle data and an anal- ysis approach that summarizes the acceleration environment in a form that simplifies the use of the data by experimenters. The main objective of this work is to encourage the development of a consis- tent and appropriate analysis and presentation approach for this type of data. The rational for the approach taken is based on the basics behind the response of linear systems to random disturbances. There is a large body of literature that covers this area and the standard approach involves the use of the frequency domain to simplify and summarize input-output relationships. While non-linear systems such as fluid systems may require more complex analysis, the basic ideas from linear system analysis form a sound basis for understand- ing such systems. Thus the analysis and presentation of the accelera- tion environment on spacecraft should be done using methods that are in line with this approach. As will be emphasized below, several advantages are gained through this approach. The paper is presented in several sections. Section 2 reviews the theory of linear systems leading to the frequency domain representa- tion of the response of linear systems to random disturbances. Sec- tion 3 reviews the relevant statistical analysis, including power spec- tral representation. Section 4 provides examples of the analysis as applied to shuttle acceleration data, and section 5 provides com- ments on the use of these to determine potential effects these distur- bances could have on experiments. 941418. Development to demonstration of active magnetic microgravity isolation systems. Carlos M. Grodsinksy, NASA. The low gravity environment provided by space flight has afforded the science community a unique arena for the study of fun- damental and technological sciences. However, the dynamic envi- ronment observed on space shuttle flights and predicted for Space Station Freedom has complicated the analysis of prior ''micro- gravity" experiments and prompted concern for the viability of pro- posed space experiments requiring long term, low gravity environ- ments. Thus isolation systems capable of providing significant improvements to this random environment have been developed. This paper deals with the design constraints imposed by acceleration sensitive, "microgravity" experiment payloads in the unique envi- ronment of space. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941419. Joint international ventures require compatible engi- neering data exchange. T. Kelly, K&amp;K Associates ; A. Weinzierl and B. Vogel, ASD GmbH; and E. Kelly, K&amp;K Associates. Organizational interfaces generally bring with them engineering data exchange interfaces. Front end planning, standardization, and simplifications can mitigate cost and schedule risks associated with these interfaces. The proliferation of high speed personal computers (PCs) and associated technical software make them an inexpensive bridge between projects and organizations. 941420. Maintenance and refurbishment thermal analysis program. Mansoor Ahmed, NASA; and Chaires L. Wiggins, Jack- son and Tuli. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is designed for a 15 year mission lifetime. To fulfill this requirement, the designs of the Sci- entific Instruments (Sis) and many of the major subsystems are capable of on-orbit repair and refurbishment. During the early design of the HST, several issues were addressed to assure on-orbit servicing would be thermally feasible. The majority of the hardware subsystems ae designed to operate within the fairly benign environ- ment inside the telescope structure. With the exception of the solar arrays, none of the Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) are designed to withstand the harsh space environment outside the telescope. Additionally, all exposure outside the telescope during a servicing mission occurs in an unpowered state. Early attempts to assess the thermal problems associated with on-orbit servicing quickly revealed an array of variables that created a thermal network of extreme complexity. It became apparent that a simplified approach would be necessary to analyze the numerous aspects involved in the proposed mission. 941421. Thermal neutral format based on the STEP technol- ogy. Pau Planas Almazan, ESA/ESTEC/YCV; and Jean Luc Le Gal, CNES. The exchange of models is one of the most serious problems cur- rently encountered in the practice of spacecraft thermal analysis. Essentially, the problem originates in the diversity of computing environments that are used across different sites, and the consequent proliferation of native tool formats. Furthermore, increasing pressure to reduce the development's life cycle time has originated a growing interest in the so- called spacecraft concurrent engineering. In this context, the realization of the interdependencies between different disciplines and the proper communication between them become critical issues. The use of a neutral format represents a step forward in address- ing these problems. Such a means of communication is adopted by consensus. A neutral format is not directly tied to any specific tool and it is kept under stringent change control. Currently, most of the groups promoting exchange formats are contributing with their experience to STEP, the Standard for Exchange of Product Model Data, which is being developed under the auspices of the Interna- tional Standards Organization (ISO 10303). This paper presents the different efforts made in Europe to pro- vide the spacecraft thermal analysis community with a Thermal Neutral Format (TNF) based on STEP. Following an introduction with some background information, the paper presents the charac- teristics of the STEP standard. Later, the first efforts to produce a STEP Spacecraft Thermal Application Protocol are described. Finally, the paper presents the currently harmonized European activ- ities that follow up and extend earlier work on the area. 941423. Experience with finite element modeling for thermal analysis. J. Doenecke, R. Schällig, and F. Zimmermann, Deutsche Aerospace AG. 175</page><page sequence="175">941423-941431 The paper presents experience with the use of the finite element (FE) technique for thermal analysis. The FE program NASTRAN was used to determine conduct- ances and to calculate temperatures and thermal distortions directly at grid points of FE models. The radiative heat exchange is consid- ered in a different way for the thermal balance of a grid point and for the balance of a node of a finite difference (FD) model. Terms of the conduction matrix between grid points of triangular elements have a physical explanation for right-angled triangles, but have only a mathematical meaning for arbitrary triangles. A method is described which allows the calculation of conductances in compli- cated structures without solving the heat balance equations. Exam- ples show that a relatively fine mesh size is required in order to cal- culate conductances with sufficient precision. For a practical prob- lem with conductive and convective heat transfer the FE method was, with a very fine mesh size, more precise than an approximate solution. The FD program TMG gives indirectly the temperatures at gird points. Models with several thousands of elements could be treated with this code. 941424. Integrated communication environment for thermal analysis software - Phase 2. Hans Peter de Koning and Hans de Wolf, Fokker Space &amp; Systems BV (FSS); Pau Planas Almazan, European Space Agency/ESTEC; and Reinier van Oosten, LOGOS Industrial Automation. The ICETAS initiative from ESA aims to provide the European space community with: • A framework for development and integration of software tools supporting the thermal design, analysis and verification process for space applications. • Effective exchange of thermal analysis models and data. In phase 2 of ICETAS a consistent set of user requirements was formulated, derived from so-called Use Cases. The Use Cases give step-by-step descriptions of the interaction between the thermal engineer and the software system. ICETAS covers the thermal engi- neering process all the way from requirement analysis and concep- tual design to test evaluation and flight support. The user requirements activity was followed by the definition of a complete, object-oriented information model (the Common Data Structure - CDS) capturing all data entities and associations needed in the discipline. The CDS was defined as a STEP/EXPRESS schema and the STEP physical file format was tentatively selected for exchange of models and data. The practical feasibility of the approach was investigated through the development of a prototype implementing a subset of ICETAS in the C++ language on top of a commercial Object Oriented Data- base Management System (ONTOS). This prototype development gave very promising results. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941425. An integrated thermal chain for systems and equip- ment design. Renard Patrice and Moinard Philippe, Matra Mar- coni Space. The usual concern of an industrial company involved in a compe- tition environment is to produce at lower cost and in shorter time while preserving a high quality standard. Because of this, particular attention must be paid to thermal anal- yses which in the space industry are very time and effort consuming tasks, and have been suffering for long of a lack of an efficient soft- ware analysis tool. This paper shows how an integrated thermal chain designed at the same time on the basis of operational tools and of the most recent hardware and software improvements can tackle this problem, open- ing new outlooks for thermal engineering for building innovative space systems. 941427. SOHO SVM thermal control. Jose L. Garcia, C.A.S.A. SOHO is a 3-axis stabilized S/C placed in operational orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange 1 point (LI). Service Module (SVM) equipments are placed mainly on the inner side of the four lateral panels, and the thermal design is based on the direct rejection of the units power dissipation via a devoted MLI/Radiator layout to fulfill the requirement, with the aid of heaters. A new MLI composi- tion based on embossed kapton, allowing a 20% reduction on mass budget of MLIs, has been developed and tested on the frame of this project. 941428. Polar Platform pay load equipment bay thermal con- trol aspects. A. Cataloglu, Dornie r GmbH; P. Argles, British Aero- space ; and B. Pieper, ESTEC. The Polar Platform is a multi-mission platform designed to oper- ate from low earth polar orbits. Its purpose is to accommodate and support various instrument complements dedicated to meteorology, earth observation and science. In its first mission configuration, ENVISAT-1, dedicated to earth observation, the lower three sections of the Payload Module repre- sent the Payload Equipment Bay (PEB), which houses the payload support subsystem units and various payload instrument electronics equipment. All units are mounted on to the internal faces of the PEB CFRP honeycomb side panels. The PEB thermal design is basically passive, assisted by heaters and in general uses conventional techniques. However, thermal dou- blers, used to spread high heat fluxes over a greater area are made for the first time from carbon/carbon. This material matches the low coefficient of thermal expansion of the CFRP panels and at the same time provides the high thermal conductivity required for this appli- cation. This paper describes the thermal control of the PEB in general and focuses on the development of the, for this application, novel carbon/carbon material. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941429.

The spacecraft consists of four major entities: the payload module, the bus module, the SAR antenna and the solar arrays. The main features of each subsystem's thermal design are presented, emphasizing the different design challenges encountered in maintaining all components within acceptable limits so that all performance requirements are met. Spe- cial reference is given to the difficulties experienced in accommo- dating the antarctic coverage. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941430. SPOT 1/2, ERSI in orbit technological exploitation. Brigitte Antonia and Jean-Michel Oberto, Matra Marconi Space. The main goal of the in-flight experience feedback is to improve the design of the next generation of satellites with regards to the cur- rent one. This experience is gained through detailed analysis of the teleme- try data originated from the satellites currently under exploitation. The comparison between the in-flight performances and the ini- tial predictions allows to reach some of the main following objec- tives: -to improve the knowledge of the real in-orbit behavior of the sat- ellites and in particular of those issued from the same family. -to update the specifications used for the design of the satellites. -to validate and improve the simulation and prediction tools. This paper presents the analysis results obtained through SPOT 1/2, ERSI, focused on thermal behavior analysis. 941431. Thermal analysis of the IUE - Fifteen years later. Jospeh T.

The observatory was placed into a three-axis stabilized, eccentric syn- chronous orbit with an inclination of about 29 degrees. Although it was designed for a 3-year lifetime, it is currently still operational. This paper will briefly review the thermal design which consists of multilayer insulation, ammonia- filled grooved heat pipes, bimetal- lic actuated louvers, and assorted commendable heaters. It will dis- cuss the 15 years of thermal data and compare the results with pre- launch predictions. This paper will also briefly discuss the more sig- nificant flight anomalies. Finally, an attempt will be made to discuss any anomalous thermal behavior with an emphasis on the tempera- ture increase of the hydrazine auxiliary propulsion system. 941432. Advanced thermal control coatings for use in low Earth orbit. Steven A. Daneman and Henry W. Babel, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. A method for applying an organic coating to Z-93, an inorganic white thermal control paint, was developed to protect Z-93 from contamination and damage. A layer of FEP Teflon™ was applied over Z-93 to provide a smooth, continuous surface without adversely affecting its optical properties. Additionally, new low- absorptance, controlled-emittance thermal control paints were developed for low Earth orbit (LEO) applications, such as the Inter- national Space Station. These paints have a range of infrared emit- tances from 0.26 to 0.88, and are stable in simulated LEO environ- ments, including atomic oxygen and ultraviolet radiation. Patent applications have been submitted for these concepts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941434. Thermal analysis of the Inflatable Torus Solar Array technology. A. P. Gurule , Orion International Technologies, Inc. The purpose of the Inflatable Torus Solar Array Technology (ITSAT) Demonstration Program is to develop the technology required to fly an inflatable solar array. As a first step to this devel- opment a preliminary thermodynamic and thermal finite element (FE) analysis was conducted. A detailed thermal and thermody- namic analysis was required in order to fully understand the thermal response and characteristics of the structure; and, how the quantity of gas required to inflate the structural support tubes will be effected. Results from the thermal analysis indicate that during deployment, which may last up to 2 minutes, the loss of internal energy of the gas and the loss of thermal energy of the structure may impede proper inflation of the tubes and thus result in deployment failure. 941435. Thermal modeling of a thermally regenerative elec- trochemical device: AMTEC. A. P. Gurule, Orion International Technologies, Inc. The Alkali Metal Thermal-to-Electric Converter (AMTEC) sys- tem is a thermally regenerative electrochemical device converting heat energy to electrical energy. Minimal thermal computer model- ing and analysis has been conducted on this device. Using an indus- try standard Computer Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Design (CAE/CAD) computer package, a detailed finite element model (FEM) has been developed and studies conducted. The FE analysis simulates the thermal performance of the cell by the calculation of the intrinsic and parasitic thermal losses. It is these losses that need to be identified and resolved because they reduce the overall cell efficiency and total electrical output. The temperature field of the cell is presented for steady state operation under various boundary conditions. This modeling effort is sponsored by, and conducted in conjunction with and compared to testing conducted at the U.S. Air Force Phillips Laboratory. 941436. Post-launch application of EP MAPS thermal models for improved on-orbit performance. David Wasson and William Ducas, Fairchild Space and Defense Corp.; and Wes Ousley, NASA. The importance of developing test correlated analytical models, of critical or unique spacecraft hardware, is not limited to pre-flight design verification. Such thermal models can also be extremely use- ful tools in assessing on-orbit operational and temperature anoma- lies. This paper discusses the application of test correlatrd thermal models, developed for a complex electro-mechanical system, in sup- port of on-orbit operational replanning in response to unexpected mechanism movement and electronics temperature levels. The mod- eling effort utilized a recently developed routine for chaining coor- dinate systems in TRAS YS (Thermal Radiation Analysis System). Results from the modeling provided detailed data, which comple- mented the limited telemetry and supported the operational replan- nig to ensure acceptable performance would be maintained throughout the mission. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941437. Space Constructible Radiator (SCR) Life Test heat pipe performance testing and evaluation. T. D. Mai, R. T. Sifu- entes, and A. L. Chen, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace ; and J. D. Cornwell, NASA. The Space Constructible Radiator (SCR) Life Test heat pipe per- formance testing is currently conducted at NASA/Johnson Space Center as part of the Advanced Technology Development Program. The SCR is a dual passage, monogroove heat pipe radiator designed and manufactured by Grumman Aerospace for NASA. The heat pipe has many aerospace applications since it can transport a large amount of heat with a compact lightweight design. As the micro- meteoroid/orbital debris environment worsens, it may be advanta- geous to add the heat pipe radiator to the space Station's thermal control system. The SCR Life Test has been operating over the last 10 years and will continue until the year 2000. The overall heat transfer coefficient has decreased from 792W/K (1500 Btu/Hr-°F) to 475 W/K (900 Btu/Hr-°F) but appears to have stabilized. This paper summarizes the SCR Life Test setup and the test results to date. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941438. The behavioral cybernetics of telescience - An analy- sis of performance impairment during remote work. Thomas J. Smith, Eric Koehler, Chris Keran, and Peter Mathison, U.S. Bureau of Mines. This report introduces a behavioral cybernetic analysis of perfor- mance difficulties inherent to teleoperation. From this perspective, the assumption is that such difficulties arise as a consequence of a degradation in the fidelity of behavioral feedback control. Concep- tual and empirical evidence is presented for the conclusion that spa- tiotemporal perturbations in sensory feedback, specific to human factors design of the task and interface, degrade behavioral control of sensory feedback and thereby critically compromise teleoperation performance. In support of this conclusion, results from a large body of experimental evidence compiled over the past four decades are summarized to indicate that both delays and spatial displacements in sensory feedback engender substantial decrements in hands-on performance, which training does not completely overcome. Recent findings are cited demonstrating that teleoperation is degraded more than hands-on performance under perturbed sensory feedback con- ditions. Findings from our research in this problem area are described, based on implementation of an innovative methodology in which sensory feedback perturbations are imposed as continu- ously varying forcing functions. Collectively, the findings and anal- ysis presented suggest that performance effects of perturbed sensory feedback constitute a major obstacle to high fidelity telepresence during teleoperation, and that design improvements aimed at ame- liorating these effects may be essential to establishing acceptable telescience applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941439. Multi-mode manipulator display system for space telerobotics. Michael Massimino, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. 177</page><page sequence="177">941439-941446 To control current and future space telerobotics systems, the operator can be faced with several difficult control scenarios regard- ing the human-machine interface. These include operating the arm with limited positioning cues, avoiding joint limits or singularities, and operating the arm a single joint at a time rather than with the hand controllers which can be required due to system failures. The two operational modes of the Multi-mode Manipulator Display Sys- tem addresses these problems. The first mode, Manipulator Position Display (MPD) mode provides the operator with positioning cues that are particularly helpful during operations with constrained viewing conditions. Experimental results have shown that perfor- mance times were much faster when using the MPD for constrained viewing tasks when compared to performance without the MPD. The second mode, Joint Operations Display (JOD) mode assists the operator with avoiding joint limits and singularities as well as with operating the manipulator a single joint at a time. 941440.

The adaptation to changes in human operator dynamics and changes in working environment dynamics can be an important issue in designing high performance telerobotic systems. This paper describes an approach to force control in telerobotic hand systems in which model reference adaptive control techniques are used to adapt to changes in human operator and working environment dynamics. The techniques have been applied to force-reflective con- trol of a single degree-of-freedom telerobotic gripper system at Wis- consin Center for Space Automation and Robotics (WCSAR). This adaptive gripping system is described in the paper along with results of experiments with human subjects in which the performance of the adaptive system was analysed and compared to the performance of a conventional non-adaptive system. These experiments emphasized adaptation to changes in compliance of gripped objects and adaption to the on-set of human operator fatigue. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941441. Perceptual biases in spatial judgments as a function of eyepoint elevation angle and geometric field of view. Claudia Hendrix, Univesity of Washington ; and Woodrow Barfield, Univer- sity of Washington. This study investigated perceptual biases in spatial judgments as a function of the computer graphics eyepoint evaluation, monos- copio or stereoscopic display, and target cube location. The display for this experiments consisted of two computer-generated cubes located above a grid plane with drop lines to the display surface. The experiment task consisted of judging azimuth and elevation angles between the target and reference cubes. The results indicated that azimuth errors varied with eyepoint elevation and were maximized at the -15 degree eyepoint, elevation errors were worse using the 75 degree eyepoint, and binocular disparity did not aid judgments of azimuth and elevation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941442. Applications of free-flying cameras for space-based operations. David E. Anderson and Courtney A. Buck, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace ; and Robert Cohen, University of Maryland. This paper defines the value of free-flying cameras to the Space Station. The use of free-flying cameras is an alternative to reliance on fixed cameras. The analysis is based upon results from recent neutral buoyancy evaluations of a free-flying camera known as the Supplemental Camera and Maneuvering Platform (SCAMP). SCAMP was evaluated for inspection and viewing capabilities that will be required by Space Station. Test results demonstrated that a free-flying camera could be used effectively for inspecting structure, viewing labels, providing views for control of extravehicular robo- tics (EVR) and for ground assistance during extravehicular activity (EVA) tasks. 941444. ROTEX - The first robot in space. G. Hirzinger, K Landzettel, J. Heindl, and J. Dietrich, DLR. The paper describes the key technologies developed for the space robot technology experiment ROTEX that flew with shuttle flight STS 55 end of April '93. During this "spacelab-D2"- mission for the first time in the history os space flight a small, multisensory robot (i.e. provided with modest local intelligence) has performed a number of prototype tasks on board a spacecraft in the most differ- ent operational modes that are feasible today, namely preprogram- med (and reprogrammed from ground), remotely controlled (teleop- erated) by the astronauts using a control ball and a stereo-TV moni- tor, but also remotely controlled from ground via the human opera- tor as well as via machine intelligence. In these operational modes the robot successfully closed and opened connector plugs (bayonet closure), assembled structures from single parts and captured a free- floating object. Key technologies for the success of ROTEX have been its mul- tisensory gripper technology, local (shared autonomy) sensory feed- back control concepts, and the powerful delay-compensating 3D- graphics simulation (predictive simulation) in the telerobotic ground station. 941445. Development of the ORBITEC Telerobitic Control System (OTCS). Ron Teeter, Tom Crabb, Anthony Kellicut, Darin Kohles, and Robert Richter, Orbital Technologies Corp. This paper describes the development of an innovative system for telerobitic control of dexterous manipulators and end-effectors. The system, known as the ORBITEC Telerobotic Control System (OTCS), provides control of position and interaction with the envi- ronment using the feedback of visual and tactile information to the operator. This approach allows for a simple, low- cost, and light- weight controller that may be integrated and used with various dex- terous manipulators/end-effectors. During the development, key master controller components were designed, built and tested by ORBITEC. These included a unique, low cost miniature rotation sensor and tactile stimulators and arrays. 941446. Trace contaminants control assembly development for the Japanese closed ecology experiment facilities. Keiji Nitta and Akira Ashida, Institute for Environmental Sciences; and Satoru Tachihara, Shunji Okada, Akira Hattori, and Masaharu Takagishi, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. In the closed environments such as a manned space station, it is necessary to remove contaminant gas to keep a suitable environ- ment. Removal of gaseous contaminants generated from crew, ani- mals, and plants is an important function to keep the environment below the allowable level in the Closed Ecology Experiment Facili- ties (CEEF). CEEF consists of three modules for habitat, animal and plant, the supporting facilities for each module and a plant cultivation facility. CEEF is scheduled to be constructed in 1994 in Aomori Prefecture, in the northern part of Japan. For designing Trace Contaminant Control Assembly (TCCA) for CEEF, the following six trace contaminants have been selected as major contaminant gas in CEEF: Ammonia (NH3), Methane (CH4), Ethylene (C2H4), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2). Ethylene is well-known as an aggressive contaminate to plant growth and maturity. TCCA is composed of two main sorbers containing activated charcoal (AC) and phosphoric acid impregnated AC, a high temper- ature catalytic oxidizer with two electrical heaters, a gas cooler, and two post sorbers containing alkali impregnated AC. The authors conducted the fundamental tests in order to confirm the TCCA design, and the results shown below are obtained: 1) The phosphoric acid impregnated AC is effective for NH3 adsorption. 2) The palladium-on-alumina catalyst is suitable for CO, CH4, C2H4 conversion at temperatures lower than 400°C. 178</page><page sequence="178">941446-941453 3) The alkali impregnated AC is effective for NO2, SO2 removal and prevents catalyst poisoning from SO2. This paper describes an outline of the fundamental test and design conditions for TCCA. 941447. Oxygen recovery using reduction of carbon dioxide and water decomposition by electrolyte. T. Kashiwai, H. Matsu- moto, N. Kamishima, S. Hatano, and T. Sawada, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , Ltd. ; and K. Nitta, Institute for Environmental Sciences. The simulation test for the closed ecology experiment facility is planned by Institute for Environmental Sciences (IES) of Japan. The purpose of this test is to confirm that in the closed space, how the ecological factors influence the mass circulating system. The environmental and life support system in IES is based on the same principle as on the earth where the carbon dioxide produced by the respiration of human and animals is reduced to oxygen by the photosynthesis of the plants, but as an auxiliary system, artificial carbon dioxide reduction system is planned to be attached. This report describes about the loop test for the reduction of car- bon dioxide using the Sabatier method: the reduction of carbon dioxide using hydrogen, the decomposition of produced methane and the water electrolysis. 941448. Nucleate pool boiling of water in normal and reduced gravity environments. Bruce W. Webbon, NASA ; Boris Yendler, Bionetics Corp.; and John B. Miles , University of Missouri. A NASA Learjet was used to produce a low-gravity environment for two series of nucleate pool boiling experiments. Surface- tem- perature and heat-flux measurements and high-speed microphotog- raphy of bubble phenomena were made on 18 prepared boiling sur- faces. The surfaces were polished copper disks, 25.4 mm and 19.1 mm in diameter, with variable artificial nucleation site densities from 0.2 to 32 sites/cm2. Both 1-g and low-g data were obtained for comparison. In every case, the boiling heat-transfer coefficient increased significantly to a new steady value for the duration of the low-gravity period. Rapid movement of the surfaces of the large vapor masses that were observed is indicative of considerable turbu- lent liquid motion, apparently induced by the bubble growth and coalescence. In no case was a decreased heat-transfer coefficient observed, which would be indicative of film boiling. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941449. Capillary movement of liquid in granular beds in microgravity. B. Yendler , Bionetics Corp.; B. Webbon, NASA; I. Pedolsky, IMBP ; and R. Bula, WCSAR. A more compete understanding of the dynamics of capillary flow through an unsaturated porous medium would be useful for a num- ber of space and terrestrial applications. One such application involves the development of an effective water and nutrient delivery system for the growth of plants in space. An experiment was con- ducted on the Mir Space Station that used an experimental cuvette called "Capillary Test Bed." An objective of this experiment was to compare fluid migration in the "Capillary Test Bed" under ter- restrial laboratory simulated microgravity conditions by positioning the cuvette such that the hydrostatic force is negated and on Mir at microgravity conditions. Differences in fluid migration in the cuvette were observed. Based on these observations, improvements in the design of the cuvette are underway, and should allow for col- lection of more precise data in future flight experiments. The results of the Mir experiment as well as the modifications to the cuvette for improved data collection will be discussed further in subsequent sections. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941450. Concept for a life support system testbed in space. Robert D. MacElroy and Mark Kliss, NASA; and Richard McKenna, Bionetics Corp. The concept of a general purpose life support system testbed for use in space grew out of considerations arising from the recent con- solidation of NASA's Advanced Life Support (ALS) Systems pro- grams. Both the physical- chemical and the biological approaches to regenerative life support will require significant amounts of in- space testing in order to prepare for the final development of sys- tems for human life support. Considerations of the technical require- ments and rationales for in-space testing has led to the concept of a common testbed that will allow faster and less expensive long duration tests. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941451. S A WD II subsystem integration into the variable pressure growth chamber: a systems level analysis using CASE/A. Adam M. Miller and Carl D. McFadden, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace; and Marybeth A. Edeen, NASA. The NASA Johnson Space Center has plans to integrate a Solid Amine Water Desorbed (SAWD II) carbon dioxide removal sub- system into the Variable Pressure Growth Chamber (VPGC). The SAWD II subsystem will be used to remove any excess carbon diox- ide (CO2) input into the VPGC which is not assimilated by the plants growing in the chamber. An analysis of the integrated VPGC- SAWD II system was performed using a mathematical model of the system implemented in the Computer-Aided System Engineering and Analysis (CASE/A) package. The analysis consisted of an eval- uation of the SAWD II subsystem configuration within the VPGC, the planned operations for the subsystem, and the overall perfor- mance of the subsystem and other VPGC subsystems. Based on the model runs, recommendations were made concerning the SAWD II subsystem configuration and operations, and the chambers' auto- matic CO2 injection control subsystem. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941452. General purpose free floating platform for KC-135 flight experimentation. Bruce A. Borchers and Boris S. Yendler, Bionetics Corp.; . Kliss and Andrew A. Gonzales, NASA; and Mark T. Edwards, BioServe Space Technologies. The Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS) pro- gram is evaluating higher plants as a means of providing life support functions aboard space craft. These plant systems will be capable of regenerating air and water while meeting some of the food requirements of the crew. In order to grow plants in space, a series of systems are required to provide the necessary plant support func- tions. Some of the systems required for CELSS experiments are such that it is likely that existing technologies will require refine- ment, or novel technologies will need to be developed. To evaluate and test these technologies, a series of KC-135 precursor flights are being proposed. A general purpose free floating experiment plat- form is being developed to allow the KC-135 flights to be used to their fullest. This paper will outline the basic design for the CELSS Free Floating Test Bed (FFTB), and the requirements for the individual subsystems. Several preliminary experiments suitable for the free floater will also be discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941453. A top-level integration for a planetary engineered closed/controlled ecosystem. Willy Z. Sadeh, Colorado State Univ.; Michael J. Condran, Colorado Univ.; and David W. Hen- dricks, Colorado State Univ. Long-term human missions in space, establishment of a human- tended lunar base and of a Martian base requires an autonomous life support system. An Engineered Closed/Controlled Ecosystem (ECCES) can provide autonomy by integrating a human module with support plant and animal modules and waste treatment sub- systems. Integration of physical/chemical and biological waste treat- ment subsystems can lead to a viable and operational bioregenera- tive system through minimizing resupply requirements from Earth. Life support requirements of the human module "drive" the design and operation an ECCES. A top-level diagram for an ECCES was developed based on the human module requirements. The proposed top-level diagram is presented and its components are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 179</page><page sequence="179">941454-941457 941454. Development of an operational CELSS prototype for use on the seafloor. Dennis Chamberlain, NASA. An operational Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) may one day be used as a significant component for an advanced life support system for deep space applications, such as Moon or Mars exploration. Active research has been ongoing since 1978 to develop and understand key components of this technology at universities and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) centers around the United States. At the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, a large plant growth chamber has been producing higher plants since 1988. This chamber has proven highly successful at producing growing crops from germination to harvest, including wheat, soybean, potato and lettuce. This 113 cubic meter chamber is the largest such closed, controlled growth chamber in the world. In direct support of the chamber are laborato- ries which supply maintenance for all aspects of the chamber opera- tions from producing nutrients to continuous monitoring and evalua- tion. As these CELSS systems become more developed and better documented, a next logical step is to better understand how these systems can be adapted to field and operation use. Such tests allow the CELSS system design to be directly adapted for remote opera- tions by separating the extensive laboratory support from the bioen- gineering system. Engineers and scientists at the KSC Biological Research and Life Support Office have developed a functional plant module for testing in an extreme environment on the seafloor at Key Largo, Florida. The world's only fixed seafloor laboratory, the MarineLab, operated by the Marine Resources Development Foun- dation, has been selected as the site for a full test of this operational plant system. This project is called the Ocean CELSS Experimental Analog - NASA, or, the OCEAN Project. The OCEAN Project will test the plant bioengineering system for a 90-day crop of wheat (Yecora Rojo), three 28-day lettuce (Wald- mann's Green) crops and dwarf tomato crops grown in succession. In addition to these plant and engineering system studies, the Princi- pal Investigator will also test a 90-day diet prepared from foods that would be found in a CELSS type menu. (The plants grown will not be eaten.) This investigation will be conducted is association with the CELSS food science group at the Purdue University NSCORT. At the same time, five private industries testing CELSS technologies will participate in field testing their CELSS-related technology and research, and while the 90-day program is underway, an extensive educational program will be ongoing with eleven elementary schools, high schools and universities. Results from the 90 day project are expected to provide informa- tion on the capability to successfully transfer technology developed in the laboratory to a remote, extreme environment for operational use. A better understanding of the extent of crew time required to interface with such systems will be investigated along with detailed information on crew response to a CELSS-like diet. CELSS technol- ogy developed under various Small Business Innovative Research grants will also be evaluated on site as well as offering a very diverse opportunity for the nation's school children and a team of University of Florida students to remotely participate with the proj- ect. 941455. Remote sites as analogs for Lunar and Mars habitat pilot studies. David L. Bubenheim, Michael T. Flynn, and Richard Lamparter, NASA ; and Christian L. Straight, Bionetics Corp. Planetary surface exploration and establishment of human habi- tats are complex tasks requiring a wide variety of capabilities. We currently do not possess these capabilities or experience base neces- sary for long-duration habitation of other planets. Future exploration can be guided by experiences gained during analogous activities at appropriate sites on Earth. The Antarctic continent is of great analog value to NASA in the area of planetary exploration. The U.S. South Pole Station is of particular relevance to habitat development. The Station offers great fidelity in resemblance to NASA missions, an effective infrastructure is already in place to support activities, and implementation of NASA-derived technologies can improve the quality of life for Station inhabitants and reduce the environmental impact of human activities on the Antarctic continent. These tech- nologies can also address important issues facing remote communi- ties around the globe. The rural towns and villages of Alaska can serve as a valuable analog to guide the transfer of technologies to real world applications with particular attention to impacts on indig- enous peoples. The operational, educational, academic, and indus- trial infrastructure systems of Alaska provide an effective bridge from the laboratory to the village in the remote bush. By teaming NASA with the people of the State of Alaska, and utilizing the expe- rience and expertise already present in Alaska, a method can be developed to guide future transfers to communities around the world lacking in technical support. The methods used by NASA to support communities outside of Earth might be applied to improve the qual- ity of life and the economy of remote communities on Earth. Espe- cially in the case of indigenous people, where induction into the main stream economic systems can threaten the culture and heritage, this approach may enable economic and community development and preserve the culture of the indigenous peoples. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941456. Lunar bioregenerative life support modeling. Alan Drysdale, McDonnel Douglas Aerospace. The computer model described previously has been used for Lunar bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) modeling. Criti- cal factors include the supply scenario (closure, consumables, and spares), startup scenarios, energy cost, mission duration, and policy on allowable dumping of trash. A BLSS will support closure of all life support functions. How- ever, startup may require some time before all support is available. Under some scenarios, closure of water is achieved at about one month, oxygen/carbon dioxide closure at two months, and food clo- sure at three months after the first harvest of food staples. Mineral closure is less critical due to the lower masses involved, particularly of micronutrients, and may not be closed until large numbers of peo- ple are to be supported for long periods of time. Alternative startup scenarios include physico-chemical support during startup, remote startup, provision of commodities by supply during startup, and ramp-up of base manning. Remote startup is the most technically challenging, and would require a trade study between the increased automation and provisions of physico- chemical regeneration equipment. Supply-based startup is the sim- plest option, but will be more massive than physico- chemical based startup. Ramp-up of base manning is an interesting case, but a subset of other options. An interesting startup scenario is the initial use of physico- chemical (PC) regeneration, with a transition to bioregenerative life support as the CELSS becomes capable of closing each loop. PC technology would be available from shorter, precursor, missions. Stored consumables would be used for contingency and minimal buffering. The physico-chemical system could be retained as addi- tional contingency capability. A number of bioregenerative scenarios have been modeled, addressing cost-effectiveness over 10 years and system startup con- straints. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941457. Lunar base life support system and site selection. Robert J. Sirko, McDonell Douglas Aerospace ; and John W. McKee, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. The selection of a life support system for a lunar base depends on many interrelated factors, both programmatic and technical. Many factors are identifiable through the application of a systems engineering approach to the lunar base design, in which base and mission requirements are determined. In addition, there is a range of evolving technology options whose cost and maturity affect their potential for inclusion in base designs. Results of ongoing lunar base design are presented with emphasis on the selection of promising approaches for advanced life support systems that decrease overall cost for a single, permanently inhabited lunar base. We identify crit- 180</page><page sequence="180">941457-941464 ical technology areas that inhibit the selection of closed life support systems and propose alternative basing scenarios to alleviate devel- opment and operational costs. In particular, we quantify the cost savings associated with establishing a base at a lunar pole in a region of permanent sunlight. Such a base uses a hybrid life support system with higher plants integrated with other physical/chemical compo- nents. We show that bases of comparable scale close to the lunar equator are most efficiently established and operated with food res- upplied from Earth, and that they are more expensive than the polar base with plants. 941458. Mars - Resources for human habitation. Richard S. Young , NASA. In any consideration of long term (one or two years) human activities on Mars, it is imperative to evaluate the effects of the envi- ronment. There are two aspects of such environmental assessments: (1) hazardous parameters and (2) resource availability. This paper looks at both from the point of view of future human expeditions which include the requirement to explore Mars at some distance (e.g., several kilometers) from the landing site, and the ability to per- form in situ measurements, physical and chemical analyses of sur- face and subsurface materials. Human activity on Mars clearly requires more support (food, water, air) than can be transported by a spacecraft. At the same time, resources for human protection from environmental hazards must be provided. This paper offers a discus- sion and analysis of these problems, based primarily on Mars fly-by, orbiter and lander data obtained in the 60' s and 70' s. The Viking orbiters and landers have been the most useful in that context. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941459. Planetary human expeditionary missions systems design and converging support technologies. William L. Smith, NASA; and John D. Rummel, Marine Biological Laboratory. Future human expeditionary missions such as return to the Moon or initial Martian expeditions must deal with new mission modes, mission environmental diversity, and extended mission durations. Two recently emerging technology capabilities, Virtual Environ- ment (VE/Virtual Reality (VR) and Computer Aided Design (CAD) /Computer Aided Engineering (CAE)/Computer Aided Manufactur- ing (CAM enhanced capability, when used in combination with a systems engineering focus on systems effectiveness and availability, can make the difference in supporting human expeditionary systems design, development, manufacturing, and operations (flight and sur- face). Mission durations for human permanent lunar operations and ini- tial and follow-on Martian expeditions will require a significant focus on system effectiveness. The systems effectiveness availabil- ity component has subsets of reliability, maintainability, operability, spares number and location, transportation capability, and "others." The recent advent of the CAD technology which permits the "form and fit" check-out and verification via a computer based design sys- tem permits new avenues to be explored in systems engineering to assure system effectiveness in the final operational design and sub- sequent operations. The same CAD/CAE/CAM engineering data bases that are used above can then be used as a foundation for virtual reality or virtual environment capability to provide additional verification of the practicality of the design. The Life-of-the-Program (LOTP) use of this virtual environment technology can be used by the flight crews for general and recurrent training for pre- mission activities and for in-mission operational support. Human expeditionary missions contain a rich complement of system engineering design challenges. Outpost and permanent lunar operations will place high demands on systems availability and minimum logistic systems. Mars human expeditionary missions require sustainable operations, often in an autonomous or robotic mode, with little or no logistics available to those assets that have been forward deployed under a split mission scenario. For the purposes of discussing both lunar and Mars human expe- ditionary missions the utilization of the "split" mission concept will be utilized. The "split" mission concept employs the use of a cargo mission first as the forward deployment of assets for the mission and incorporates the use of autonomous or robotic emplacement and ini- tial readiness of all the systems before commitment to a crew launch. The subsequent launch in the "split" mission concept is the crew launch. In the case of lunar mission, that could be a month after the cargo mission. In the case of a Mars mission, that duration would be 26 months later due to the recurring orbital dynamics of the Earth-Mars system. The advent of capabilities to conduct system engineering with the use of CAD/CAE/CAM capabilities and VE/VR technologies permits the mission and systems developers to meet the above chal- lenges with a degree of assurance not achieved in prior space sys- tems applications. This paper will discuss the diverse nature of the lunar and Mars environment, the lunar and Mars operations related to human expe- ditionary mission, the systems engineering implications including the decomposition of basic mission timelines, the fusion of CAD/ CE/CAM and Virtual Environment (Virtual Reality) technologies, and the Life-of-the-Program utilization of those fusion capabilities. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941463. Preliminary results of NASA ECLSS life testing. Charles Y. Chiù, ION Electronics ; Jay L. Perry, NASA; and Blaine H. Salyer and James D. Tatara, ION Electronics. As part of the development of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) for the International Space Station (ISS), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been conducting extended duration testing of ISS critical ECLSS subassemblies. The ECLSS Life Testing Program (ELTP), which is being conducted in the Core Module Integration Facility (CMIF) at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), began in Novem- ber 1992. Since that time subassemblies for trace contaminant con- trol, carbon dioxide removal, and urine processing have been oper- ated continuously under simulated ISS loads. The performance of each subassembly and details concerning subassembly test anoma- lies are provided. 941464. Alternate environmental control and life support systems technologies for space station application. John B. Hall, Jr. and Carolyn C. Thomas, NASA Langley Research Center. Alternate environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) technologies were evaluated to reduce space station resources and dependence on expendables resupplied from Earth to sustain a multiperson crew in low-Earth orbit. Options were evalu- ated to close the oxygen (O2) loop by removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the cabin air, reducing the CO2 to water, and electrolyz- ing the water to provide metabolic O2 for crew consumption. Options were also evaluated to close the urine/flush, condensate, and hygiene water loops to provide potable water for crew use. Spe- cific evaluation parameters were derived which included weight, power, volume, maintenance, resupply consumables, and technol- ogy readiness. The potential for significant resource reductions were indicated by modifying the space station ECLSS baseline to replace the cabin air CO2 removal unit with a move efficient process, adding a hydrogénation process for CO2 reduction, and adding an electroly- sis unit to produce O2 for the crew. Further potential resource reduc- tions were indicated by replacing the urine/flush water recovery unit with an ultra-efficient distillation unit. The ultra-efficient distillation unit has the potential to operate on space station waste heat and pro- vide the water recovery subsystem with essentially 100 percent water recovery. The advantages of providing ECLSS technologies for the space station, which also could be used for human interplane- tary missions, are addressed. 181</page><page sequence="181">941465-941472 941465. Electro emissive devices - Progress made in develop- ment. Albert Braig, Thomas Meisel, Walter Rothmund, and Ruediger Braun, Dornier GmbH. Electro emissive devices, called ESTHER, are thin sheets - simi- lar to solar cells - whose infrared emissivity can be varied reversibly by electrical charging. Bonded to external surfaces of spacecraft radiators, they allow active control of the heat radiated to space while consuming negligible electrical energy. Applying this novel component for spacecraft thermal control, considerable cost savings in spacecraft development and operation can be achieved. Progress in the design and manufacturing process has been made since the first publication in July '92 revealing an increased variabil- ity of emissivity and an increased duty cycle stability. The material selection process was facilitated by the exposure of material samples to the space environment during two spaceflight missions and the subsequent material analyses. For the design of the electrical inter- connectors and the definition of the element- to-radiator bonding process, heritages have been made from the photovoltaic solar array technology. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941467. The Liquid Droplet Radiator - European perspec- tive. José Rivallin, Bertin and Cie ; Jan A. R. Persson, ESA/ESTEC ; and Gerard Gallay and Alain Verneau, Bertin and Cie. The Liquid Droplet Radiator (LDR) has emerged as the most promising among a number of spacecraft radiator concepts, which seek to offer light-weight alternatives to conventional, primarily heat-pipe based, radiator technology. Relying solely on conven- tional radiator technology will in the future lead to an unacceptable mass penalty on the part of the radiator. In the LDR the solid surface of current radiator designs is replaced by sheet-like spray of minute droplets, which radiate heat to space in between being ejected and collected external to the spacecraft. The droplet diameter is typically of the order of 100pm. Early studies in the US indicated that by employing the LDR the radiator mass could be reduced five to ten times for high- power applications stretching from 100 kW and upwards. In view of the great potential benefits of the LDR, ESA decided in 1989 to study the LDR from a European perspective, which meant focussing on power levels well below what had been conceived previously. Fol- lowing an initial literature survey, a contract was awarded to Bertin et Cie of France in 1991 for an in depth study of the LDR for heat rejection in the range 1 to 100 kW. It included a review of future growth of heat-rejection requirements for European space activities and a trade-off between design options and selection of one design for a detailed concept investigation. The related Liquid Sheet Radia- tor (LSR) concept was also part of the study. It appears that the most favorable design option for the reference mission, a 100 kW telecommunications satellite, as well as for the alternative, a 10 kW polar platform would be a rectangular LDR with a mass considerably less than that of a comparable heat-pipe radiator. The design includes two droplet sheets (one out-going, one in-coming) and a structure, which consists of an unfurlable truss beam. Surrounding the droplet sheets, the truss beam is attached at one end to the exterior of the spacecraft via a yoke and a rotating drive to maintain grazing sun-incidence. The droplet generator is modular, with a shear valve for turning it on and off and operates based on the cavity- disturbance mode. The droplet collector is of the linear type with an auxiliary film. A review of the technology status in Europe shows that all necessary competence for development of the LDR is available. Furthermore, critical technologies have been identified in order to help orienting a future development program. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941468. Leakage detection in space. H. G. Wulz, Dornier GmbH ; H. G. Herrmann, Institut für Bauweisen- und Konstruktions- forschung; and M. F. Schön, University of Stuttgart. A permanent presence in orbit and, as consequence, the storage of fluids in space makes it necessary to provide a qualified mean which is used for search and localisation of leakages in space. In this paper, dominating flow regimes are explained of leaking gases and liquids in vacuum which are dependent on their physical properties and on leak geometry. A large number of different mechanical, ther- mal, electrical, physical and laser optical methods have been assessed and traded which potentially are suited for design of a proper leakage detection system in space. Particularly one laser opti- cal technique was found to best meet the requirements for leakage detection in space combined with thermographica image analysis. The working principle of the proposed laser optical method is based on remote sensing of a leakage flow by the aid of a scanning laser beam. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941469. CPA: a controlled pump assembly for application on S/C cooling loops. M. N. De Parolis, ESA/ESTEC ; and P. Reusser, Reus ser AG. This paper presents the final results of a technology contract ini- tiated by ESA at the end of 1990 to develop a controlled pump unit for use on board spacecraft and space vehicles. The main features required for the CPA were the adaptability to any working environ- ment (vacuum or pressurized compartment, operation in any mis- sion phase) with a high degree of reliability and efficiency, the com- patibility with a wide range of fluids and the usability as a compo- nent of both single phase and two phase cooling loops. The final design of the assembly is presented and discussed. The main part of the presentation is devoted to the description of the tests performed to qualify the design and to the presentation and discus- sion of their results. The program demonstrated that the technology for a flight wor- thy, compact, light variable speed pump assembly is available in Europe, in particular for special applications as on board spacecraft requiring very low disturbance levels (microgravity applications) or on board vehicles requiring operations during high mechanical load phases (launch and re-entry). 941470. Measurement of co-efficient of thermal expansion of CFRP strut for IRS-1C spacecraft. A. Ramasamy, D. T. Srinivas, P. P. Gupta, and H. Narayanamurthy, ISRO Satellite Centre. The measurement of coefficient of thermal expansion of CFRP strut which is planned to be used in Indian Remote Sensing Space- craft (IRS-1C) has been measured from -10°C to +50°C using an electronic digital indicator. A suitable test rig was designed and fab- ricated to carry out this measurement in the required temperature range. The coefficient of the thermal expansion results obtained with this testing and technique are accurate to ±13.4% and the repeatability of this measurement is better than ±1.3%. 941471. Experimental evaluation of copper braid thermal conductance for IRS-1C spacecraft. A. Ramasamy, V. Ramakrish- nan, D. T. Srinivas, P. P. Gupta, and H. Narayanamurthy, ISRO Sat- ellite Centre. "Tinned Copper Braid" is planned to be used in IRS-1C space- craft for the thermal control of the detector of the "Middle Infra Red" (MIR) band of LISS III Camera. The thermal conductance of the braid was evaluated experimentally in the temperature range of -65°C to +35°C by employing the calorimetrie technique. The mea- sured thermal conductance of the 215 mm long copper braid varies from 0.051 to 0.056 W/°C at different temperatures in the specified range. An error estimation has been performed which shows a maxi- mum uncertainty of better than ±5% on the conductance value mea- sured. 941472. Control of the adsorption refrigerator power. V. M. Khaustov, Luikov Heat and Mass Transfer Institute ; and N. V. Gulko, Academy of Science. 182</page><page sequence="182">941472-941480 A mathematical model for the adsorption refrigerator unit opera- tion has been proposed, considering sorption kinetics and hydraulic resistant of vapour tubes. As the result of the experimental studies sorption isotherms and kinetic curves for activated granular carbon CKT, carbon fiber adsorbents, zeolite and water have been obtained. A criterion for the refrigerant quantity determination for filling up the refrigerator unit has been proposed. The paper shows the possi- bility of effective control over refrigerating capability of the adsorp- tion refrigerators and of the provision of uniform heat removal from the evaporator by a corresponding choice of hydraulic drag of a vapor tube. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941473. Ground calibration of the mass spectrometer and total pressure sensor in the midcourse space experiment (MSX). O. Manuel Uy, Richard C. Benson, Mark T. Boies, James D. Kinni- son, and John S. Morgan, Johns Hopkins Univ.; and Stuart A. tison, Albert R. Filippelli, and Charles R. Tilford, National Institute of Standards and Technology. The absolute measurement of low-density gases, especially water, is of interest to space experiments. Water measurements have been advanced by the development of a primary standard for low- density water vapor. This standard, which uses arrays of laser- drilled holes as a Knudsen-effusion water source, was used to cali- brate and characterize the performance of several vacuum instru- ments, including transfer standards used to calibrate the MSX flight mass spectrometer. This mass spectrometer and a total pressure sen- sor will be used to measure the absolute densities of molecules out- gassing from the spacecraft during orbit as well as gases present in the ambient atmosphere. Results for the performance of these two flight instruments over a large range of partial pressures of H2O, H2, He, N2, O2 and Ar are presented, as well as test results for the refer- ence standards. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941474. Design and performance of the cryogenic two phase flight experiment (CRYOTP). Patrick J. Brennan, O AO Corp.; Lee Thienel, Jackson and Tuli ; Marko Stoyanof, Phillips Labora- tory ; and Mel Bello, Aerospace Corp. This paper summarizes flight test results which were obtained in the Cryogenic Two Phase Flight Experiment (CRYOTP). This was a HitchHiker canister experiment that was flown aboard the space shuttle Columbia in March of 1994. Two flight articles were tested independently. The first was a nitrogen heat pipe with five parallel fibrous copper cable wicks. It did not start up in either of two cooldown cycles. Post flight inspec- tion of the heat pipe showed that it had its original fluid charge. The failure to start up is attributed to the large fluid inventory and the conduction gradient that existed due to nominal parasitic heat leaks along the titanium heat pipe tube. Complete success was obtained with the Brilliant Eyes Thermal Storage Unit (BETSU) which con- tains 2-methylpentane phase change material for temperature con- trol at 1 20K. More than 200 hours of on orbit tests consisting of sev- eral cooldown cycles and 55 freeze/thaw cycles were obtained with BETSU. Degradation of the five tactical coolers that are flown in the CRYOTP was also observed. One of the coolers on the NHP side of the experiment failed completely, apparently due to leakage of the helium working fluid. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941475. Possibility of application of spacecraft infra-red radiation analysis to determination of its thermal condition. Pavel N. Shaburov, Nicolai A. Anfimov, Dmitry K. Vinokurov, and Gennady S. Mishin, TSNIIMASH. It is proposed the approach to the analysis of SC' s thermal condi- tions in orbital flight, based on study of its signal characteristics and thermal optical portraits, which are gotten with various resolutions. The given approach consists of analysis and comparison of measure- ments in various bands of spectrum of radiation and reflection char- acteristics of investigated SC, with calculated and experimental data. The calculated estimations of SC' s infrared radiation were car- ried out for the occurrence on it the typical non-standard situation. In this paper it is proposed the criteria, which can be used during the fulfillment of distant analysis of SC' s functional condition on the base of the data of observation of its signal optical characteris- tics. As the examples of non-standard situations there were consid- ered the solar battery control malfunction, the locking of the heat- transport medium flow rate regulator, the break of the pump in ther- mal-control system, and the stall of the shield-vacuum heat insula- tion (SVHI) from the SC body. 941478. 1ASI instrument - 100K passive radiator thermal concept. Guy Pepino, Aerospatiale ; and Benjamin Pouilloux, CNES. IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) is an Earth observation instrument carried by the METOP polar platform (launch foreseen in the beginning of the second millenary) in low earth (altitude of 838 km) heliosynchronous orbit with a local time descending node of 9.00 A.M. The program is in phase B and under responsibility of CNES and ASI (Italian Space Agency). Its mission is to measure the emission spectra of atmosphere in the field 3.4 to 15.5 p.m. In this range of wave length, desired performances require cooling of the detection unit around 100 K. After a trade-off, a cryogenic passive radiator has been preferred to a mechanical cooler for reliability, life duration, simplicity and absence of induced vibrations reasons. This paper describes the ther- mal concept of the radiator used to cool down the detectors. The detectors dissipation is 56 mW. The major problem in achieving cryogenic temperatures with passive radiator systems is to insulate thermally the system from the spacecraft and its external environment. In order to avoid direct solar input on radiative plates, a sunshield is used (cylindrical for manufacture aspect). Due to its form and its high level of specularity, the major part of albedo and earth fluxes coming on the sunshield are space rejected. Then, an earthshield is used to minimize the albedo and earth fluxes on the sunshield. Moreover, the radiative plates are in direction of Earth limb, so they can't receive direct albedo or earth fluxes. In order to reduce thermal inputs coming from the spacecraft, the cooler is a two stage cooler, each stage being thermally insulating from each other by multilayers insulation for radiative aspects and by low conductive support (glass fiber) for conductive aspects. This multistage concept reduces parasitic heat leakage to the cold stage. Each stage has its own radiative plate with high emittance to reject heat loads to space. The detectors are on the coldest stage. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941479. Design and in-orbit thermal performance of the pas- sive radiant cooler on-board INSAT-2A. C. K. Krishna Prakas, D. R. Bhandari, and V. K. Kaila, ISRO Satellite Centre. INSAT-2A spacecraft carries on-board a Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) as one of the major payloads for the purpose of meteorological observations. The thermal infrared (IR) detector of the Radiometer requires cooling to cryogenic temperature for its operation at any of the set points in the range of 105 K to 115 K for optimum performance. A passive radiant cooler has been designed and realized indigenously to meet this requirement. A computer oriented mathematical model has been developed which simulates the on-orbit thermal environment and predicts the perfor- mance of the cooler for various sun illumination conditions. INSAT-2A spacecraft has completed more than one year of its suc- cessful operation on-orbit now. It has been observed that a minimum patch control power margin of 4.7 mW exists for beginning of life (BOL) condition i.e., 5th August, 1992. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941480. XMM-RGS cryogenic detector housing. K. Thomsen and G. Heidenreich, Paul Scherrer Institute. 183</page><page sequence="183">941480-941486 The Reflection Grating Spectrometer experiment (RGS) on the ESA corner stone X-Ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM) uses charge coupled devices (CCD) as detectors. Thermal requirements are the main driver for the layout of the detector housing. Parasitic heat inputs stem primarily from radiative coupling and from conduction over the structural support. Improvements in the design of the elec- tro optical model (EOM) over the bread board model (BBM) resulted in a system that guarantees a CCD temperature of -130°C at the end of the mission while not precluding the possibility to heat the detectors as high as +130°C which might be useful for annealing the CCDs. 941481. The development, verification and application of a spacecraft cryogenic phase change thermal storage unit. David S. Glaister, Kevin D. Bell , and Mel Bello , Aerospace Corp.; and Fred Edelstein, Grumman Aerospace Corp. This paper presents a summary of the design, development, and ground verification of the BETSU (Brilliant Eyes Thermal Storage Unit) experiment. The BETSU utilizes 2- methyl pentane as a 120 K PCM (Phase Change Material) and will be flown on board the Shuttle in early 1994. There has been very limited experience with the space flight of cryogenic phase change materials. Space applications for a cryogenic TSU include the storage of energy for the cooling of temperature sensitive sensor components such as focal planes, optics, mirrors, and telescopes. Based on ground test data, trade studies were performed which show the sig- nificant weight and cost benefits, of the BETSU technology. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941482. A new orbital disconnect support for cryogen tanks. A. Seidel, P. Schwabbauer, K. H. Hilmer, and H. Lieb, Deutsche Aerospace ; R. Schällig, Bayern-Chemie; and C. Jewell, ESTEC. A novel orbital disconnect support (ODS) for cryogen tanks is described which makes use of the change of length of a "shape memory alloy (SMA)" element located at the warm end of a strap- type support. At room temperature the SMA-element is at its extended length with the support strap in disconnected condition. Upon heating the SMA-element to approximately 90°C, it contracts such that it gets in contact with the support strap and provides the strap tensioning force. During testing of a breadboard ODS a ratio of up to 6,4 between the connected and disconnected heat flux via the ODS was demonstrated. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941483. Long life vacuum dewar technology for Columbus freezer. H. Rüdiger, A. Hofmann, J. Wolf, and G. Tan, Linde AG. To prepare the technology for a long term vacuum insulated dewar for the European Columbus attached laboratory a study was performed to evaluate adequate insulation methods. Different insulation and design concepts were evaluated and the necessary technologies for a long term insulated dewar were devel- oped, including the use of getter material. A cylindrical test dewar of length 800 mm and diameter 450 mm, was manufactured and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the selected technology. The pressure evolution in the test dewar has been monitored for more than a year. The pressure dropped from qp"5 mbar to well below qO"6 mbar in the first year. The intention is to continue the monitoring for at least 2 years. The work was done under ESA-contract No. 9586/9 1/NL/FG. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941484. Measurement of hemispherical total emittance in cryogenic temperature. Akira Ohnishi, Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. Measurement of hemispherical total emittance, £h material for cryogenic engineering in the temperature range of 10-50K is pro- posed. This measurement is based on calorimetrie method and £h is obtained by measuring a sample temperature corresponding to heat input to a sample heater. In order to verify this method, the parameter £h is analyzed for a test chamber by using a thermal math- ematical model. 941485. Spacecraft on-board equipment low temperature cooling complex. I. A. Zele nov, V. G. Ziiev, and V. M. Kovtunenko, Lavochkin Association. The report presents the results of developing, ground testing and space exploitation of the systems providing the low temperature cooling of the onboard equipment of the spacecraft at stationary and elliptic orbits when it is arbitrarily oriented on the Sun and the planet. The complex under consideration has been developed at Lavochkin Association and consists of two systems which function either autonomously or jointly. To satisfy the requirements to the on-board heat-sensitive ele- ments cooling to the low temperature and cryogenic temperature levels is one of the key problems arising at the design stage and then in the process of providing of the on-board systems operation during flight. This paper deals with the main results achieved in designing test- ing and long-term exploitation (on-board the spacecraft at the geostationary orbit) of the spacecraft on-board equipment low tem- perature cooling complex which exhibited the capability to cool the on-board equipment to the temperatures of 130.. .200 K at thermal loads of 10.. .20 W and to the temperatures of 240...260K at the ther- mal loads of 30...50W. The systems have no mechanically movable elements; the long- term exploitation of these systems in space has proved their high reliability, performance stability and resistance to the influence of destabilizing factors. Problem and methodology approaches to experimental testing of cryogenic systems in test equipment with nitrogen imitator of space environment are also considered. The report presents the computed data of the systems exploita- tion results and provides the analysis of identity of the results of mathematical modeling of the systems performance and ground thermovacuum tests data together with the results of temperature measurements in the process of system exploitation during space- craft mission. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941486. Weathering of lunar simulants. James P. Oglesby, Willard L. Lindsay, and Willy Z. Sadeh, Colorado State Univ. Conversion of lunar regolith into a plant growth medium is cru- cial to the development of a regenerative life support system for a lunar base. Simulants must be used to study weathering processes and to develop procedures for the conversion of lunar regolith into a suitable plant growth medium because of the shortage of actual lunar materials. Dissolution studies have been conducted for Johnson Space Cen- ter Lunar Simulant- 1 (JSCLS-1) to assess levels of plant nutrients and toxic elements. Weathering in water for 150 d, in the presence of atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide, yielded alkaline solu- tions with pH near 8.8. Concentrations of most plant nutrients were at levels normally considered acceptable for plant growth. However, nitrogen was deficient, and phosphorus was present at levels typical of unfertilized soils. DTPA extracts indicated possible manganese and zinc deficiencies. Solution metals were at concentrations far below those generally harmful to plants. Results for Minnesota Lunar Simulant (MLS) were similar to those for JCSLS- 1. Deficient elements identified were identical, with the exception of zinc which was deficient only for JSCLS-1. Amounts of iron or manganese extracted with DTPA were compara- ble for the two simulants, even with much higher glass content in JSCLS-1. This suggests that similar minerals control the extracta- bility of iron and manganese. Comparison of results shows that MLS can be used in addition to JSCLS-1 for studying important aspects of weathering chemistry. 184</page><page sequence="184">941488-941495 941488. The NASA Ames Controlled Environment Research Chamber - Present status. Anthony R. Gross, David J. Korsmeyer, Lynn D. Harper, and Edwin L. Force, NASA. The Controlled Environment Research Chamber (CERC) at the NASA Ames Research Center was created for early-on investigation of promising new technologies for life support of advanced space exploration missions. The CERC facility is being used to address the advanced technol- ogy requirements necessary to implement an integrated working and living environment for a planetary habitat. The CERC, along with a human-powered centrifuge, a planetary terrain simulator, advanced displays, and a virtual reality capability, is able to develop and demonstrate applicable technologies for future planetray explo- ration. There will be several robotic mechanisms performing explo- ration tasks external to the habitat that will be controlled through the virtual environment to provide representative workloads for the crew. Finally, there will be a discussion of innovative new multidis- ciplinary test facilities, and how effective they are to the investiga- tion of the wide range of human and machine problems inherent in exploration missions. 941489. Regenerative life support systems: modeling, analy- sis, and laboratory development Satoru Suzuki, Ryuzo Tazawa, and Tadafusa Uchida, Shimizu Corp. ; and Robert J. Sirko, McDon- nell Douglas Aerospace. McDonnell Douglas Aerospace and Shimizu Corporation are jointly designing and laboratory testing critical elements of an inte- grated physical-chemical and biological regenerative life support system with food production. The primary target application is a manned lunar base. Component computer models for selected pro- cessing technologies have been developed and integrated into a detailed regenerative life support system computer model. The mod- els are used for preforming systems analysis. The component mod- els include physical- chemical air revitalization and water recycling, physical-chemical and microbial waste treatment components, and plant growth units. Based on the component modeling and analysis, requirements have been identified for bioregenerative life support systems of decreased size and power consumption. These require- ments in turn have been used to develop specific hardware design approaches, including microalgae-based gas regeneration and food production. Results of laboratory testing of these components and their performance characteristics are presented, along with an assessment of their potential role in our baseline regenerative life support system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941491. Thermal Math Model of the space station U.S. Labo- ratory-A module. Margaret E. Solomon and Thomas H. Ibara, Boeing Co. This paper presents the development of a Thermal Math Model (TMM) of the space station U.S. Laboratory-A module. The TMM is used to predict operating thermal environments for all interior and exterior areas of the laboratory module. The model was constructed as a tool for performing developmental design analyses providing payload designers and analyzers a mens for accurately predicting payload environments. The TMM determines the overall effect of a payload rack on neighboring subsystem and payload racks, stand- offs, endcone regions, and the module cabin. The TMM has also been used to assess the percentage of Internal Thermal Control Sys- tem (ITCS) cooled electronic equipment input power that dissipates to the module cabin air system. Active and passive thermal systems of the laboratory module are integrated in the TMM, providing the capability of predicting the interaction of the two thermal systems. The need for assuming appropriate module internal boundary temperatures is eliminated by use of the TMM because all internal and external thermal systems are included in one model. The primary required TMM inputs include crew member and equipment sensible heat loads, ITCS coolant supply temperatures and mass flow rates, desired orbital parameters, and cabin set point temperature. The TMM was developed using the Systems Improved Numeri- cal Differencing Analyzer (SINDA85) and Thermal Radiation Ana- lyzer System (TRAS YS) programs. Modeling is included for the passive module structure, payload and subsystem racks, standoff and endcone equipment, and ITCS lines and components. The con- ductive and convective interaction of air in the module cabin, racks, standoffs, and endcones is also modeled. Detailed thermal modeling techniques are covered as well as a summary of the potential applications of the TMM. Results are included for the following sample analysis cases: 1) minimum sur- face temperature/condensation potential assessment, 2) peak air and structural surface temperature assessment, and 3) ITCS cooled elec- tronic equipment airborne heat dissipation determination. The mathematical model presented herein was developed for the previous space station design; however, the methods and procedures are appropriate for the current International Space Station Alpha (ISSA). 941492. International Space Station Alpha internal thermal control system coldplate development Eric Mickelson and Oscar Buchmann, AlliedSignal Aerospace. A family of ten coldplates has been developed. These form an integral part of the International Space Station Alpha internal ther- mal control system (ITCS) and provide necessary cooling for elec- tronics and experimental equipment. These coldplates are robust single-passage, single-pass, plate-fin heat exchangers. They provide surface-mounted equipment cooling with a minimum coolant pres- sure drop, minimum weight, and maximum service life at an eco- nomical cost. The ten coldplates vary in size, thermal performance, and equipment mounting configuration. This paper describes the design and performance of each cold- plate. Data from performance tests and performance derivations based on the test data are presented. These data are presented in a form suitable for use in the design of equipment applications. 941493. Space station distributed avionics air cooling. E. O ' Connor , R. Rason, and D. Rubalcaba, Hamilton Standard Space Systems International, Inc.; and J. Klym, Boeing Defense and Space Group. A distributed avionics air architecture provides air cooling and air circulation in non-habitable space station zones utilizing dedi- cated hardware to support the zone-specific needs. That dedicated hardware, the Avionics Air Assembly (AAA), includes a selectable speed fan and heat exchanger used in racks for active avionics air cooling to reject the airborne head load directly to the moderate tem- perature internal thermal control system (ITCS). This paper addresses the design impacts resulting from the international space station alpha (ISSA) restructure effort. It defines the service pro- vided by the avionics air assembly, the design requirements and the integrated system performance. Detailed package configuration and interfaces, hardware design and off-design performance are included to define the full range of operating capability. 941495. An overview of the redesigned space station thermal control system. Joe Chambliss and Jeff Dominick, NASA ; Jim Kukla, Lockheed Engineering and Sciences ; and Frank McCall, Boeing Defense and Space Group. In the spring of 1993, the Clinton administration called for a scaled down space station as part of a reduction in the funding level available for NASA projects. To take advantage of the products of the SSF program in containing costs, NASA considered the use of Space Station Freedom (SSF) components and concepts to develop a new design. The redesigned space station concept that was devel- oped calls for a significantly different Thermal Control (TC) than was used in the SSF design. 185</page><page sequence="185">941495-941500 This paper provides an overview of the redesigned space station thermal control system. The top level design requirements are sum- marized as they relate to the functions the TC is to provide. The functional link of TC components and space station elements into the Internal Active TC (IATC), External Active TC (EATC), Photo- voltaic Active TC (PVATC), Russian Segment TC (RSTC) and Pas- sive TC (PTC) subsystems is discussed and presented in system schematics. Characteristics of each system are described as are the capabilities of the redesigned TC. 941496. Ozonocatalytic oxidation of contaminants. V. U. Zlo- topolsky and T. Y. Volkova , Institute for Biomedical Problems . The addition of small quantities of ozone to an air stream passing through a catalytic oxidizer has three effects: the temperature neces- sary for catalytic oxidation is decreased from 450-600 K to 330-350 K, working time of catalyst is increased, and the suite of complex oxidation of all complex organic compounds that can be oxidized is increased. Experiments have shown ozonocatalytic oxidation of xylene, tol- uene and carbon monoxide to water and carbon dioxide. The investi- gations were carried out with various oxide catalysts, at several tem- peratures with various gas mixtures, and at various flow rates. It was shown 1 ) that the process of oxidation was associated with the for- mation of atomic oxygen from ozone; 2) that cobalt and copper oxides have maximum activity, and 3) that optimal conditions are in the range T=333-343 K, W=20000h" 941497. A study on the elements recycled in the vegetable supplying system of a lunar base CELSS. Akitoshi Yokota and Masahiko Enomoto, JGC Corp.; and Keiji Nitta, Institute for Envi- ronmental Science. Selected vegetables for life support are continuously produced in the lunar farming module. Inedible parts of the vegetables are decomposed and provided as the fertilizer elements for the next veg- etables. In this report, contained elements in their inedible mass for recy- cling are discussed for each of the four vegetables. Elements and concentration of cultural liquid which are required by each vegeta- ble are surveyed as well. Adjustment of decomposition liquid is discussed in view of transforming inedible vegetable to cultural liquid. Authors are pro- posing wet oxidization as one of the decomposition methods for these inedible parts. Some adjusting sub-system is necessary here, since elements and thier concentration in decomposition liquid is not enough to reproduce vegetables. This report aims to clarify the composition of a vegetable pro- duction system for an eight-member crew. 941498. A study on wet-oxidation waste management process design. Akitoshi Yokota , Masahiko Enomoto, and Kenichiro Hayashi, JGC Corp.; Mituo Oguchi, National Aerospace Labora- tory ; and Keiji Nitta, Institute for Environmental Science. The catalytic wet-oxidation process is the most feasible candi- date for the waste management process of CELSS in comparison with other applicable technologies such as dry incineration, vapor compression distillation, etc. In this report we try and discuss the design of a Wet-Oxidation Waste Management Process which supports one person's life in a closed system. The proposed Wet-Oxidation Waste Management process treats the waste by a two-step reaction. Planned capacity is approximately 2.5kg-dry/day. A design concept, schematic flow and basic configuration of Wet Oxidation apparatus are considered and discussed in this paper. 941499. Mineral recovery system in a CEEF. Hideaki Kurokawa, Kiyomi Funabashi, Satoshi Sugawara, and Ryusuke Abe, Hitachi, Ltd.; and Keiji Nitta, and Akira Ashida, Institute for Environmental Sciences. We propose a new recovery system for NaCl from human urine. This system has an electrodialysis (ED) part and a crystallization part. Separation and concentration characteristics of the system are discussed for fundamental experiments of the ED and crystallization parts. Concentrated NaCl-KCl mixed solution is obtained using the ED process from simulated oxidized urine and sweat which include Ca2'u+ and S042" ions. Then, the crystallization process is used to separate about 80% of the NaCl from the ED treated solution. The experimental studies indicate that the mineral recovery system we proposed can recover NaCl form waste water of an CEEF. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941500. Concepts for advanced waste water processing sys- tems. Stephen R. Gustavino and Carl D. McFadden, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace; and Ronald J. Davenport, Life Systems, Inc. One of the chief functions of a spacecraft life support system is to supply the crew with sufficient water for potable and hygiene uses. In the past, crew water supply has typically been renewed through the addition of fresh water into the system, and the spent water is either stored or vented. This fresh water typically makes up the majority of the weight associated with the resupply of life sup- port consumables. Therefore, recycling the system's initial water supply represents a significant cost savings if it can be implemented without increasing maintenance requirements or the amount of sup- port hardware needed for system operation. Systems capable of recycling waste water using physical/ chemical water processors have been studied for several years now, and many have obtained the degree of reliability that comes with technological maturity. However, they have inherent limitations and often require their own expendables in the form of chemical addi- tives or filters. Changeout of these expendables requires crew main- tenance time. Future missions will be better served by systems that can operate for extended periods and do not require valuable crew time or constant resupply from Earth. As many of the traditional waste water technologies continue to advance, we find new and bet- ter ways of designing closed water processing systems. Recent years have also seen the introduction of "new" biologically based sys- tems capable of breaking down various contaminants. These tech- nologies have long been employed by terrestrial waste water treat- ment facilities and are now being tested for space applications with a significant degree of success. These bioreactors have a number of advantages, including a minimal need for power. However, there is still much discussion as to whether or not biological systems can adapt to all the types of waste that might be encountered during extended space flights. It is argued that these systems have a certain vulnerability that is not present in the more traditional physical/ chemical water processors. This paper explores how existing processors that have been designed for space flight might be reconfigured to produce waste water reclamation systems that maintain a high degree of closure with a minimal need for expendables. We will also look at how biologically based systems might be incorporated within existing designs to accomplish the same objectives. Recent test results from a study involving the vapor compression distillation unit are pres- ented and discussed to determine the feasibility of the suggested design approaches. Long-duration manned missions will benefit greatly from the development of regenerative life support systems. The resupply of resources required to sustain life effectively limits human explora- tion of even our own moon. The international space station, too, will benefit from systems that recycle valuable resources. Although it is often considered an orbiting platform within range of "easy" resup- ply, the fact is that its mission is long-term, and to be cost-effective its design should be treated as such. As with most vehicles, the recurring operational cost of resupplying the station will soon out- weigh the nonrecurring cost of its initial design and launch. From this perspective, a reduction in system expendables outweighs a reduction in system weight and, to some degree, even a reduction in system power. It is in this vein that we consider potential improvements to water reclamation system (WRS) designs. 186</page><page sequence="186">941500-941506 Water typically constitutes the majority of the weight associated with life support system resupply. The approach used in the Space Station WRS design recognizes this fact and mitigates the problem by recycling 98% of the station's water. Despite this high degree of closure, there is still room for improvement in other areas. Most of the processors used in the Space Station design require filter change- outs, resin cartridge replacement, or chemical pretreatments. These are all expendables that subtract from the benefits of having a highly closed water system. Therefore, a logical approach to improving the current design is to maintain or increase the degree of system clo- sure while reducing the amount of expendables and crew mainte- nance time required. This study will focus on reducing system expendables. There are a number of factors that typically must be considered before one can begin to choose the water processing technology that best suits the needs of a particular mission. These factors include crew size, waste water sources, and the presence of gravity. We will use a top-level approach, using the Space Station WRS as a founda- tion and then expanding into different system configurations and the incorporation of new technologies. We will consider two WRS design schemes. The first is a physical/chemical design incorporat- ing the same processors that are currently planned for Space Station. The second uses a bioreactor in the loop to further reduce expend- ables. Both of these designs assume restrictions and waste water loads similar to those expected on Space Station, and limitations in crew size or waste water sources are not investigated. The presence of gravity is not a strong consideration for the physical/chemical design, but it could be very significant for the advanced design, which contains a bioreactor. The data used for the bioreactor perfor- mance were estimated from terrestrial testbed data. Bioreactor per- formance, as well as its configuration, may change when employed in a microgravity environment. The bioreactor data are presented so that the potential gains from the incorporation of a bioreactor into a space-based WRS might be considered. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941501. Development of an Intermediate-Scale Aerobic Bioreactor to regenerate nutrients from inedible crop residues. Barry W. Finger and Richard F. Strayer, Bionelics Corp. Three Intermediate-Scale Aerobic Bioreactors were designed, fabricated, and operated. They utilized mixed microbial communi- ties to bio-degrade plant residues. The continuously stirred tank reactors operate at a working volume of 8 L, and the average oxygen mass transfer coefficient, kLa, was 0.01 s" K Mixing time was 35 s. An experiment using inedible wheat residues, a replenishment rate of 0.125 day"1, and a solids loading rate of 20 gdw day"1 yielded a 48% reduction in biomass. Bioreactor effluent was successfully used to regenerate a wheat hydroponie nutrient solution. Over 80% of available potassium, calcium, and other minerals were recovered and recycled in the 76-day wheat growth experiment. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941503. Stand alone major constituents analyzer flight design. Diego A. Torres and Anne Cole, Orbital Sciences Corp.; and Jeff Hiss, Boeing. The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) on Space Station utilizes the Stand Alone Major Constituent Ana- lyzer (SAMCA) for monitoring major atmospheric constituents from several sampling locations within the station. This paper describes the design of the flight SAMCA instrument and contains: system overview, SAMCA interface description, mechanical description, operational mode summary, and performance capabili- ties. The SAMCA monitors six major constituents: oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water vapor, and methane. In order to monitor these gases the SAMCA uses a permanent-magnet, single- focusing mass spectrometer. This configuration was originally developed for the Skylab metabolic analyzer and most recently used for the Spacelab' s Gas Analyzer Mass Spectrometer, GAMS. For the SAMCA application, the mass spectrometer and its support elec- tronics were repackaged to meet Space Station requirements. The SAMCA is installed in the ECLSS Atmospheric Revitaliza- tion (AR) rack. The SAMCA interfaces with the AR rack via two manual mate connectors which supply electrical power and provide a 1553B communication bus for data and control. Other manual mate connectors provide the pneumatic interface for sample acquisi- tion. The SAMCA mounts to the AR rack with two drawer slides and four screws on the front panel. In order to comply with maintainability requirements the SAMCA flight design has been divided into seven Orbital Replace- able Units (ORUs): ORU 01, Data and Control Assembly ; ORU 02, Major Constituent Analyzer Assembly; ORU 04, Power Supplies; ORU 05, Sample Pump Assembly; ORU 06, Sample Distribution Assembly; ORU 07, EMI Filter; and ORU 08, Verification Gas Assembly. All ORUs are mounted on the chassis assembly or Addi- tional Maintenance Item (AMI). 941505. Analysis of gaseous products generated by long term storage of rodent waste. Barbara J. Corbin, NASA; and Marianne K. Steele, Martin Marietta Services, Inc. The Centrifuge Facility will provide a life sciences research labo- ratory for rodents and plants on the space station. During a 90-day experiment increment, soiled waste trays from the rodent habitats must be safely stored. The present tests investigated what gases are generated and what bacteria survive during long- term storage of rodent waste and waste tray materials. Soiled filter material from flight and ground control Animal Enclosure Modules (AEM) flown on STS-54 January, 1993 and from the Research Animal Holding Facility (RAHF) flown on Spa- celab Life Sciences - 2 (SLS-2) in October, 1993 were placed indi- vidual air-tight glass test vessels. Gas samples were withdrawn from each vessel and analyzed for a target list of volatile organics, odifer- ous compounds and methane using a GC/MS and detector tubes. No target compounds were detected in any of the AEM and RAHF samples. Ammonia, methane and some non-target com- pounds were detected in one AEM sample and the RAHF samples. Pressure measurements indicated that no gasses accumulated during storage. Microbial analysis showed a preponderance of environmen- tal and human-related bacteria. These data suggest that rodent waste materials may be stored for long periods of time with little potential for generation of waste gas- ses or growth of bacteria harmful to humans. 941506. Characterization of condensate from the research animal holding facility (RAHF). Catherine C. Johnson, Richard J. Twarowski, William E. Hinds, and Paul D. Savage, Jr., NASA; Marianne K. Steele, Martin Marietta Services, Inc.; and Donald Layne Carter, and Monserrate C. Roman, NASA. Life Sciences research on Space Station will utilize rats to study the effects of the microgravity environment on mammalian physiol- ogy and to develop countermeasures to those effects for the health and safety of the crew. The animals will produce metabolic water which must be reclaimed to minimize logistics support. The conden- sate from the Research Animal Holding Facility (RAHF) flown on Spacelab Life Sciences-2 (SLS-2) in October 1993 was used as an analog to determine the type and quantity of constituents which the Space Station (SS) water reclamation system will have to process. The most significant organics present in the condensate were 2-pro- panol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, acetic acid, ace- tone, total proteins, urea and caprolactam while the most significant inorganic was ammonia. Microbial isolates included Xanthomonas, Sphingobacterium, Pseudomonas, Pénicillium, Aspergillus and Chrysosporium. Previous testing of the SS Water Processor has shown that all chemical and microbial contaminants present in the RAHF condensate can be adequately removed. 187</page><page sequence="187">941507-941511 941507. Evaluation of volatile organic compounds in human breath and environment during EXEMSP92. C. Soulez- Larivière, ESA/ESTEC ; J. Cl Le Pechón, JCLP HYPERBARIE ; and E. Radziszewski , CERTSM. In 1992, an isolation campaign (EXEMSI'92) was organized by ESA at DLR premises (Deutsche Forschunganstalt fuer Lift and Raumfahrt). A hyperbaric chamber was used to isolate 4 subjects for 61 days. In the scientific program of this campaign, a few experi- ments were dedicated to study volatile organic compounds present in human breath and environment. This paper describes briefly these different contamination experi- ments, and details the qualitative and quantitative results. Emphasis is made on a method used to identify and measure bioeffluents in human breath and to determine metabolic production rates. Discussion focusses on observed variations and tries to make some comparisons/correlations between results. Recommendations are made for the monitoring and control of atmospheric volatile con- tamination during space flights. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941508. Envelopes of operationg conditions for acceptable crew comfort at low space station ventilation velocities. Donald H. Sargent, Grumman Technical Services Div. It was shown in a previously-published study, that for the light crewmember activity levels applicable to space station, ventilation velocities could be lower than 15 feet per minute, and still provide for crew comfort. However, the previous calculations to determine effects of ventilation velocoty upon heat flux were conducted only for nominal values of other environmental parameters. As described in this paper, the study has been expanded to establish envelopes of operation in terms of five main independent variables: cremember activity levels (metabolic rates), cabin air temperatures, cabin air relative humidities, ventilation velocities, and levels of clothing. The results are presented in terms of data tables, such that the boundaries for achieving acceptable crew comfort can be deter- mined for combinations of the five independent variables over real- istic ranges. Using these tables, sets of operating conditions might be chosen as alternatives to the most power-intensive (high velocity) one, to achieve the required heat flux for comfort. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941509. Numerical prediction and evaluation of Space Sta- tion intermodule ventilation and air distribution performance. Chang H. Son, Robert S. Barker, and Eugene H. McGraw, Boeing Co. This paper presents the basic test data obtained from tests of a cabin air distribution system in a simulated Space Station Man- Tended Capability (MTC) configuration and correlations of some of this data with the results from analytical modeling of the test setup flow conditions. The MTC configuration simulated in the test setup includes: Lab-A, the Node, the Cupola, and the Pressurized Module Adaptor (PMA). The test data and analytical data presented are confined to those for the Lab module. The cabin air distribution system controls the flow of air in the open space of a Space Station module. In order to meet crew com- fort criteria the local velocities for this cabin air are required to be distributed within a specified range with upper and lower limits. Achieving this desired velocity distribution is dependent upon the: (1) design of the cabin air supply equipment and cabin air return equipment, (2) total flowrate of air supplied to and subsequently returned from the cabin, and (3) interactive effects of any other addi- tional air flow streams which enter and exit the cabin. The basic Space Station design for the cabin air supply and air return equipment was used in this test program. This equipment is included in the Temperature and Humidity Control (THC) sub- system for the Space Station. Two other air streams, in addition to what is defined as THC cabin airflow, which were involved in the test program were: 1. Open Hatch Airflow - Simulated open hatch conditions between the Lab and the Node and between the Node and the PMA were implemented to interchange airflow between modules. 2. Intermodule Ventilation (IMV) Airflow - IMV assemblies are used to interchange airflow between Space Station modules. These modules include the U.S. Lab-A module, the nodes, the PMA, and the international modules. Test results for the Lab module from thirteen of the test runs which demonstrate the ability for the air distribution system to meet its objectives are presented. These test run results are compared with each other with respect to their standing relative to meeting the test objectives. Correlations of test data with the computed results from analytical modeling of the test setup are also presented. The test program investigated the effects of variable conditions in meeting the test objectives. The basic variables in these test runs were the THC airflow and the methods of interchanging airflow between the modules noted above. The Lab module THC airflow varied from 320 cfm to 400 cfm in the test runs presented here. The test and analytical developments discussed in this paper are applica- ble to the newly designated International Space Station Alpha (ISSA). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941510. Detailed integration analysis of the space station life support system. R. G. von Jouanne and R. S. Barker, Boeing Co. A considerable amount of integrated Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) analysis has been performed and doc- umented for the proposed habitable Space Station. Earlier analytic activities have resulted in highly refined models simulating Temper- ature and Humidity Control (THC) and Atmosphere Revitalization (AR) hardware. As the mechanisms by which these items affect the Space Station environment have become better understood (along with the effects due to operation of various Man Systems utilities), the next stage of the integrated analysis task has been accomplished i.e., the simulation of the Atmosphere Control and Supply (ACS) subsystem. The focus of the present paper is upon the ACS function in the overall life support system. Modeling of the ACS is unique among the life support disciplines in that it requires accurate representation of all other ECLSS subsystems that interact with the cabin atmo- sphere (which has now been achieved) in order to be realistic. The G 189 A Environmental/Thermal Analysis computer program contin- ues to be the preferred analytical tool for this Space Station inte- grated ECLSS analysis task. As the restructured Space Station design matures, the ECLSS analytic effort is marked by progressive enhancements, both in terms of new modeling features and of an increase in the fidelity of existing features. One modeling enhancement which is covered in detail in this paper is the simulation of equilibrium between pressur- ized elements which are connected via open hatches. The primary ACS function which is assessed via this enhancement is the makeup of oxygen and nitrogen. The results presented herein clearly demon- strate the integrated effects upon the ACS due to operation of the THC, AR, and Man Systems hardware. The results also delineate the performance of the ACS hardware with respect to specific Space Station program requirements. 941511. Dew point analysis developments for space station. Robert S. Barker and Glenn A. Sitter, Boeing Co. This paper reviews the recent G189A computer program devel- opments in the area of humidity control for the U.S. Lab Module in the Space Station. The humidity control function is provided as an indirect or passive function by the Common Cabin Air Assem- blies (CCAA) in pressurized elements or modules in the Space Sta- tion. The CCAAs provide active cabin temperature control through implementation of a digital/electromechanicl control system (i.e., a proportional/integral (PI) control system). A selected cabin tempera- ture can be achieved by this control system as long as the sensible and latent heat loads are within specified limits. 188</page><page sequence="188">941511-941517 In this paper three pertinent analytical cases directed to determin- ing minimum or maximum dew point temperatures are discussed. In these cases the basic sensible heat loads are set at constant values. The sources of water vapor in the module include: 1) the crew activ- ity timeline with variations in metabolic heat load, 2) the cyclic operation of the Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) which alternately removes water vapor from the cabin (along with CO2) at a steady rate and subsequently returns water vapor to the cabin as a pulse, 3) operation of Crew Systems equipment (such as the handwash facility or the shower) on its timelines. Since the sources of water vapor are all time varying, it is evident that the issue of extreme cabin dew point temperatures requires a transient analysis. Prior to discussing the three analytical cases considered here, dis- cussions of the operations and of the thermodynamic principles involved in the performance of the CCAA and the CDRA are included. Also, the interactions of the CDRA and CCAA are dis- cussed. The results of the three analytical cases are presented. It is shown that for the present design performance modeling and data for the CCAA and the CDRA and the sensible and latent loads imposed on the system considered here the specified minimum and maximum limits on cabin humidity can be accommodated. The Space Station requirement that the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) equipment and other equipment be capable of surviving a laboratory module depressurization/ repressurization event must be dealt with analytically. The depres- surization process includes condensation of water vapor followed by freezing. These change-of-phase processes have been included in the G189A program's simulation logic. An example analysis of a Lab Module depressurization event has been run and the results are included here. The condensation and freezing effects are noted. 941513. Heat transfer in porous insulations. W.-D. Ebeling and W. P. P. Fischer , DASA/ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH; and K. Keller, ESTEC. When gas conductance/natural convection plays a major role as heat transfer path, microporous insulations reveal distinct advan- tages compared to Multi-Layer Insulations (MLI). For re- entry vehicles as e.g., HERMES or capsules silica and ceramic microfiber insulations have been investigated by DASA/ERNO in a tempera- ture range up to 650°C or, respectively, up to 1200°C. In the frame of an ESTEC funded study, three types of microporous insulations - microfiber, microsphere and polyimide foam - have been analyti- cally and experimentally investigated as candidates for the internal insulation of a MARS-lander in a carbon-dioxide atmosphere for temperatures ranging from -1 10°C to 50°C. This paper compares the test results with analytical heat transfer calculations and describes methods to improve the thermal insulation performance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941514. Investigation of different surface coatings exposed to low earth orbit environment during EURECA and D2 missions. Bruno Schwarz, Johann Antonenko, and Ulrich Rieck, DASA/ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH. Surface materials exposed to low earth orbit environment for a prolonged time will be attacked by ultraviolet radiation and atomic oxygen. In combination with frequent thermal cycling the materials may change their structural and thermo-optical properties due to degradation and erosion resulting in an alternation of the initial sur- face morphology and chemistry. The stability of the materials can at best be investigated by direct exposure to the environment on a spacecraft. For this reason mate- rial exposition experiments (AOST and AOET) were organized on the European Retrievable Carrier EURECA and on the German SPACELAB D2 missions, respectively. This paper describes the thermal control coatings and the struc- tural protective coatings investigated and the degradation results due to low earth orbit exposure. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941515. EURECA postflight investigation. U. Rieck, H. Kerst- ing, H. J. Rosik, and B. Schwarz, DASA/ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH; and R. Aceti, M. V. Eesbeek, M. Froggatt, and G. Gour- melon, ESTEC. With the successful retrieval of EURECA, the EUROPEAN RETRIEVABLE CARRIER, again a long term orbit satellite (11 months in space) is available for the space material community to investigate the influence of low earth orbit environment on materials which stayed in orbit for a prolonged time. EURECA, designed, manufactured and launched to carry out numerous experiments in the fields of fluid and solar physics, mate- rials science, biology and astronomy under orbital conditions, in parallel presents a huge material exposition experiment in itself, providing detailed insight into the possible orbital degradation mechanisms due to synergistic effects of atomic oxygen, UV radia- tion, thermal cycling, high vacuum and micrometeorite/debris impacts. In order to exploit the valuable information, an integrated ESTEC/ERNO team has been established to perform a detailed investigation of the EURECA surface and - as far as accessible -in- ternal structural parts and experiments. The main inspection activities consisted of photographic survey of EURECA, visual inspection of the MLIs as well as measurements of the thermal properties absorptance/emittance and the perfor- mance of wipe tests in regions of interest. In order to provide optimum accessibility and transparency the collected data were fed into a database allowing structured data stor- age, search and processing. The present paper summarizes the investigation activities -high- lighting the significant findings - and presents an overview regard- ing the database established. 941516. The qualification testing of two solar reflectors. Neil Merry weather-Clarke and Simon Peskett, Rutherford Appleton Lab- oratory. A number of tests have been performed on two coatings having relatively low afe ratios in order to qualify them for use on the Cor- onal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS). The coatings tested were (i) a 4 |im layer of SiOx on a hand polished aluminum alloy substrate, and (ii) a white Plasmocer coating on an aluminum alloy substrate. The tests performed included he measurement of thermo-optical properties, an evaluation of minimum adhesive strength, the effects of thermal cycling in vacuum and proton bombardment, and resis- tance to cleaning processes. All the evidence obtained during the investigation indicated that both coatings were acceptable for flight on CDS and perhaps other contamination-sensitive instruments where traditional solar reflec- tors, e.g., silverized Teflon or white paint, are not acceptable due to the large quantities of adhesive required to ensure good thermal con- tact in the case of the former or the presence of organic molecules and particulates in the case of the latter. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941517. Emittance measurement on various optical solar reflectors. A. Ramasamy, N. K. Sundaresan Padmanabhan, P. P. Gupta, D. R. Bhandari, and H. Narayanamurthy, ISRO Satellite Centre. Thermal control materials of different types are being used on the spacecraft for temperature control viz. Thermal control tapes, Ther- mal control paints, Anodized surfaces and Optical solar reflectors. This paper covers the measurement of emittance at different temper- atures on various Optical Solar Reflectors (OSR) both rigid and flexible types. The rigid OSRs evaluated are OCLI-USA, PPE-UK and ISRO-INDIA. The flexible OSR is from SHELDAHL- USA. The emittance of the OSRs were measured in the temperature range 223K - 373K using steady state calorimetrie method. Measurements were done on a square sample with OSRs affixed on each face. The sample has a built-in heater and an evacuated low temperature radia- tion receiver is used for the test environment. 189</page><page sequence="189">941517-941525 Experimental results, temperature dependence of the total hemi- spherical emittance relation for each of these OSRs and error esti- mation are presented in this paper. The results indicate that for all rigid OSRs the total hemispherical emittance increases with temper- ature from 223K to 323K but later drops with increase in tempera- ture. For flexible OSR the total hemispherical emittance increases with temperature from 223K to 348K and later decreases with increase in temperature. Facilities and measurement technique used here are capable of providing the results better than ±2.2% in the measured temperature range. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941518. Peculiarities of thermal conditions of screen- vacuum thermal insulation of spacecrafts. Sergei M. Bednov and Victor L. Maslov, Scientific-Research Institute of Thermal Processes ; and Victor L. Maksimov, Lavochkin Association. A thermal condition of a pack of screen-vacuum thermal insula- tion (STI) of spacecrafts (SC) in the sun flux was studied experi- mentally. The pack consists of facing materials (glass cloth of differ- ent colors, fabrics of synthetic materials), screens from polymer films (mylar, kapton) with one and two-sided metallization with dif- ferent gasket materials. Experiments were conducted in the simula- tion thermal vacuum chamber with a solar simulator (S0 = 1.4kW/m2). It is demonstrated that there was a significant nonuniform tem- perature distribution along pack screens - there was a significant overheating (to 150 K depending on pack composition) of internal layers in comparison with external ones. Highly satisfactory results are explained by the greenhouse effects in the STI. The correspond- ing calculation mathematic model was developed. It is demonstrated and experimentally verified that if the pack construction of STI is not flat, but it is a cavity, then in this case the influence of the received effects is significantly intensified. A pack of STI was proposed with considering their peculiarities. This composition of STI was used in spacecrafts "Venus," "Mars" and others. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941519.

Centrifuge testing of the Integrated Closed Environ- mental Control System (ICECS). William G. G rues beck, Systems Research Laboratories; Vance D. Skowroński, Armstrong Labora- tory ; and Mayra I. Martinez and Roland J. Watts, Wright Labora- tory. The Dynamic Environment Simulator (DES), a man-rated centri- fuge, was used to support testing of the Integrated, Closed Environ- mental Control System (ICECS). DES drive and support systems were modified to satisfy ICECS power, cooling and control require- ments. Digital control of the DES drive systems allowed ICECS exposure to acceleration magnitudes approaching 10G for extended periods. During latter phases of testing, G profiles were customized as indicated by the results to completely determine ICECS system dynamics. The DES provided a flexible, low cost test bed with all test objectives satisfied on time and on budget. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941522. Conversion of existing vapor cycle system from R-114 to R-134a. Kenneth Coleman, Grumman Aerospace and Electronics Group. Production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) is being banned due to environmental concerns regarding ozone depletion. All CFCs are anticipated to be out of production by the year 2000. This ban has prompted the need for converting existing systems to use atmo- spherically safe refrigerants or replacing the systems altogether with environmentally safe alternatives. This paper documents an analytical study initiated on the E-2C aircraft program to assess requirements for converting the existing vapor cycle system from R-114 to R-134a. The effort focused on determining the maximum cooling capability readily achievable with the new fluid within the present system volume, and identify- ing the associated changes in vapor cycle system weight and power required to maintain at least the existing system capacity. Particular emphasis was placed on avoiding changes to the ram air scoop to eliminate flying qualities impact. A vapor cycle performance code was developed to obtain maximum system cooling capacities at the design condition for several component configurations. Parametric analyses were also used in assessing required compressor character- istics over a range of cooling loads and compressor efficiencies. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941524. An overview of cryogenic activities at CNES. Irénée Alet and Jacques Mauduyt, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. CNES' s involvement in research work into space cryogenics began at a very early stage. METEOSTAT's passive cryogenic radiator was designed by CNES around 1970. Work on mechanical cryogenic machines began around 1985 with theoretical studies. The first basic mock- ups were made in 1990 for Vuilleumier and Stirling cycle machines. This work led to the completion in 1993 of two breadboards (CEA/ CENG and L'AIR LIQUIDE). During this time, CNES developed a space experiment for the OMEGA project using a Stirling machine in the tactical class which was subject to a qualification cycle specially designed for the proj- ect. In order to promote very low-temperature astronomy experi- ments, CNES began the space qualification of a cooler developed by the CNRS/CRTBT in Grenoble. This system uses the dilution of helium 3 in helium 4 to lower temperatures from 4 K to 0. 1 K. A temperature of 4 K can be obtained either with a helium bath or a mechanical cryogenic machine. Pulse tubes are a promising system for the future as they have no moving mechanical parts, no friction and no vibrations. In the near future, such tubes could replace the Stirling cycle space machine displacers. CNES is interested in the development of such systems and several French laboratories and manufacturers are at the forefront of research in this area. For the IASI project, a passive cryogenic radiator for a sun- synchronous orbit is being designed by AEROSPATIALE at Cannes. It will reach 100 K with a cooling capacity of 400 mW. CNES is also participating in the design and development of numerous other space experiments using cryogenic techniques and is conducting a research plan on cryocoolers. 941525. Status of pulse tube developments at CEA/SBT. A. Ravex and P. Rolland, CEA/DRFMC/SBT. Interest in the pulse tube comes from its potential for high reli- ability and low level on induced vibration. A numerical model has been developed to provide a tool for prac- tical design. It has been successfully validated against the experi- mental results obtained with a single stage double inlet pulse tube which has achieved a temperature of 28 K at a frequency of a few Hz. Further developments have demonstrated the capability of oper- ating a pulse tube at higher frequencies in association with a Stirling pressure oscillator. Current projects include coaxial geometry for miniature pulse tubes with linear resonant pressure oscillators. A 4 K multistaged pulse tube is also in development. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 190</page><page sequence="190">941526-941530 941526. Use of mechanical coolers for space application. B. Collaudin, Aerospatiale Cannes. For some years, Aerospatiale has been developing various space observation systems. In some of them, equipment has to be cooled below 100K. Trade off has shown that mechanical coolers have to be used. The cooling subsystem is composed of the coolers, the cryostat, and the supporting structures. The design drivers for this subsystem are the mechanical stability of the detector, the thermal (temperature level and stability, heat budget) and electrical performances. The vibrations induced by the cooler are one of the major con- cerns, and implies to use a set of two coolers, plus an active control of the induced vibrations. A mock-up of one cooling subsystem is being built. The objec- tive is to verify the thermal performances of the cryostat together with the coolers, and to measure the level of induced micro vibration generated by the coolers in various configurations. 941527. Development of a miniature pulse tube refrigerator. Marc David, L'Air Liquide; and Jean-Claude Meréchal and Yvan Simon, I'E.N.S. A development program of Pulse Tube Refrigerators is currently in progress at L'Air Liquide in collaboration with E.N.S. The system was designed for space and military applications (about 1 W at 80K). The pressure oscillation was given by the so cal- led RH820 oscillator manufactured by L'Air Liquide. For long life space applications, it can be easily changed for an ' 'Oxford type" oscillator which has approximately the same swept volume but a higher working frequency. The cooling power measurements obtained with Double Inlet Pulse Tubes of different sizes and with different regenerators are compared with our analytical model. 941528. Development of a Stirling cryocooler using hydrody- namic gas bearings. L. Duband, A. Ravex, and P. Rolland, CEA/ DRFMC/SBT. A double stage Stirling cryocooler for a long life space borne operation is under development at CEA/SBT. The cooler has been designed to provide simultaneous cooling capacities of 1 Watt at 50 K and 5 Watts at 190 K, with maximum efficiency. An original technology using hydrodynamic gas bearings and clearance seals for contactless operation has been developed and successfully assessed. A twin piston pressure oscillator and a two stage cold expander both using hydrodynamic gas bearings and clearance seals have been designed and fabricated. The performance of the oscillator have been reported elsewhere and are summarized in this paper. The cold finger using a linear motor and a magnetic spring is inserted between both bearings for resonant operation. Linear motor performance, magnetic spring stiffness and resonant frequency experiments have been carried out. Preliminary pneumatic and thermal tests of the overall system are in progress. This work is undertaken in collaboration with AEROSPATIALE and L'AIR LIQUIDE. 941529. Compact turbo-machinery for a microgravity- compatible freezer application. Philippe Viennot, L'AIR LIQ- UIDE - DT AS; Chris Savage, ESA/ESTEC; and Jean-Claude Vil- lard, L'AIR LIQUIDE - DT AS. The paper describes the pre-development of the compact turbo- machinery forming the heart of a reverse-Brayton-cycle refrigera- tion unit for application in a microgravity-compatible freezer. The machine has been configured to provide refrigeration at -80°C in the face of continuous loads of 10 W and transient loads of up to 30 W without disturbing the microgravity environment. Other important requirements were; operational life-time without maintenance of at least 10 years, high coefficient of performance to minimize power consumption, low mass and small size. In the interests of reliability and microgravity compatibility, the compressor wheel and the expansion turbine have been mounted on the same shaft, driven by a brushless DC electric motor. This approach assures the most compact design, however, it gave rise to complex design iterations. The need to minimize thermal losses resulting from conduction through the shaft and to avoid mechanical resonance effects at the very high (up to 20,000 Rpm) shaft speeds, also presented interesting design challenges. Results are presented covering tests on each of the individual components together with performance projection of the complete machine. 941530. Development of a heat switch for use 20 -50 K. T. W. Bradshaw, A. Orłowska, D. Cragg, and J. Hieatt , Rutherford Apple- ton Laboratory. If a cryocooler connected to an instrument fails there is a para- sitic load on the instrument due to conduction down the cold finger. In normal operation the cryocooler provides enough cooling to absorb this parasitic load in addition to the cooling required for the instrument. If multiple coolers are used on an instrument it is helpful if the failed cooler can be thermally disconnected to reduce the ther- mal load on the remaining coolers. Also, it may be a requirement that a "spare" redundant cooler be thermally connected to the instrument to provide cooling in place of a failed cooler. For both of these operations some type of thermal switch is required. The design and development of such a switch is described in this paper. When two metal surfaces are pressed together the contact between them is on the tips of irregularities on their surfaces; these asperities are plastically deformed as the load increases so that the area of contact is proportional to the load. Surface finish of the con- tacts is important as true metal to metal contact has to be established to provide good thermal contact. Conventional designs rely on clamping two or more surfaces together. The approach taken in our design was to employ rotating cams that "wipe" the surface to ensure tue metal to metal contact. The contacting surfaces were gold-plated copper. A stepper motor with a 0.036N m torque was used to rotate the cams and Belleville washers were used to provide the clamping force. A reduction ratio of 100 was used with the stepper motor to provide the torque required to operate the switch. The requirement was that the switch should exceed, when closed a conductance of.05 W/K at 20K and .2 W/K at 50K. The best results were achieved when the joint was made at, or near, room temperature. In conventional heat switches making the joint at low temperatures can degrade the performance from that of a joint made at room temperature by up to a factor of 100. In the device described in this paper this factor was only 1.3 at 50K. This clearly demon- strates the effectiveness of using a wiping action over the conven- tional approach. The conductance of the switch did not follow the expected dependence on force. The conductance between plain clamped contacts has been found to vary as the F° 75 where F is the clamping force. In tests on this switch the conductance was propor- tional to F049 at room temperature rising to F0 77 at 100K. This was not due to any change in the spring constant of the compression springs. The "off' conductance of the switch was less than 3x1 0"4 W/K. This would give a heat leak below 60mW. This is less than 20% of the cooling power of the two-stage Stirling cycle cooler that has been developed at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory for ESA (300 mW at 30K). This very low off conductance was achieved by using approximately 200 thin steel washers as part of the support structure while in the 4 'off ' state. The multiplicity of thermal inter- faces provides a low thermal conductance link. The total mass of the switch was 618g which includes the stepper motor (195g). The power required during a switching operation at room temperature was 1.9W during one switching operation of duration 100 s. The switch passed qualification level vibration test- ing. 191</page><page sequence="191">941531-941538 941531. ESA's potable water recycling concept, system's architecture and test results. Roger A. Binot, European Space Agency; J. M. Barreau , Carrar ; and P. Amblará , Techno- Membranes. Preliminary development of a core water-recycling system for potable water reprocessing has been performed, supported by a criti- cal assessment of the required architecture and extensive experimen- tal testing of materials, technologies and procedures. The functional architecture of the water-recycling system is char- acterized by a Core Water-Recycling System (CWRS) reprocessing potable water from moderately contaminated water such as hygiene water and condensation and C02-reduction waters, and a comple- mentary treatment technology allowing further processing of highly contaminated sources such as urine and brines from the core system. The quality of this last processed water is sufficient to allow its reprocessing by the core system. Technologies involved in the core water-recycling system and complementary brine recycling system are based on chemical treatment, ultra-filtration, reverse osmosis at acidic and neutral pH, photo-oxidation and phase-change. For the brines and urine processor a vapor-compression distillation (VCD) concept is considered. A simplified breadboard of the Core Water-Recycling System was installed consisting of a microbial stabilization step (peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide and a short UV treatment) followed by ultra-filtration and two successive reverse osmosis steps at acidic and neutral pH. Long-duration testing with this breadboard treating real shower water was performed showing that the resulting water quality ful- filled the drinking water standard except for the total organic carbon content that was slightly above the standard value of 0.5 pmm. The reprocessed water also proved to be safe from a microbiological and toxicological (including pyrogens) point-of-view. 941532. Pay load water management system for space mis- sions. C. Moulin and F. Sammut, Centre de Recherche de la Com- pagnie Générales des Eaux; B. Boissier and C. Cornuejols, Orbi- tics; C. Stammer, Krüger; and F. Bréchignac, European Space Research and Technology Centre. A new system for recycling water for the experimental payloads for future space manned and unmanned missions has been devel- oped which uses the following processes: microfiltration, reverse osmosis, adsorption and UV sterilization. A breadboard has been designed, built and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept. The results of a 6 month test period have shown, after optimization, that the required water qualities could be produced. The tests have also determined that the final space system should have a volume of less than 1/3 m3. 941533. Design and testing of a UV bactericidal and photo- oxidation chamber for use in a space water recycling system. J. M. Barreau and G. Devidts, CARRAR; F. Teffo and J. De Laat, Laboratoire de Chimie de l'Eau et des Nuisances; and R. Binot, ESTEC. Work has been undertaken on a UV reactor design following the recommendations from the previous phases of an ESA contract on Water Management identifying UV bactericidal chamber as a criti- cal technology. The originality of this reactor is to operate at two wavelengths which will allow a combination of bactericidal and photodecomposition effects. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941534. Water behavior control at body cleaning in micro- gravity condition. N. Takahashi and M. Higuchi, Takenaka Corp.; M. Horimoto, ToTo, Ltd.; and K. Otsuji, Mitubishi Heavy Industries. Active control of water behavior is inevitable in the daily life using water, such as hand/face washing and bathing, under the micro-gravity environment in space. Water used for hand wash and body cleaning clings to the body skin by the surface tension effect, and shed water droplets float around in a washing chamber or in a crew cabin. Water behavior during hand washing activity in a free air stream was investigated on the NASA KC-135 jet plane intro- ducing 15-20 seconds of micro-gravity condition at parabolic flights. Downward air stream was proved to provide quasi-gravity force to wash down water droplets to the bottom of the chamber. Then the air flow analysis was conducted to predict water droplet behavior in a chamber designed for space hand washer. Disturbance of air flow by the hands inserted from an opening to the chamber was analyzed. By-passing an opening of air flow in the chamber to the hand insertion opening will prevent the water droplets from escaping from washing chamber into the crew cabin. The status of ongoing study to establish design technique to prevent water splash by the controlled air flow is presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941535. Development and operation of the Mir space station system for hygiene waste water recovery. N. M. Samsonov, N. S. Farafonov, L. Kh. Abramov, and S. S. Bocharov, AO NIICHIM- MASH; N. N. Protasov and V. V. Komolov, NPO Energia; V. B. Filonenko, AO VNIIGIDROMASH; and A. A. Berlin, Institute of Medico-Biological Problems. The paper deals with the system for hygiene water recovery developed for the Mir orbital space station. The paper presents a system schematic, its operation logic and the system component design. The results of system ground checkout tests and its operation on the Mir space station verify the system design solution adopted and the effectiveness of the procedures developed for system preserva- tion and re-activation prior to and during station spaceflight. 941536. Systems for water reclamation from humidity con- densate and urine for space station. N. M. Samsonov, L. S. Bobe, V. M. Novikov, N. S. Farafonov, B. Ja. Pinsky, G. Kh. Abramov, M. S. Amiragov, and V. B. Astafyev, AO NIICHIMMASH; V. G. Riferì, KPI; V. B. Filonenko, AO VNIIGIDROMASH; N. N. Protasov, NPO Energia; and Ju. E. Sinjak, IMBP. This paper deals with water reclamation from humidity conden- sate and urine schematics and processes realized on orbital space stations Salut and Mir. The results of research in updated processes and schematics for condensate separation, purification and distilla- tion with heat energy recovery are described. It is shown that the processes and hardware make possible to reduce energy demand and the weight of the water recovery systems under operation on space stations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941537. A general concept of designing an autonomous water system for interplanetary spaceships. E. N. Starikov and Yu. E. Sinyak, Institute for Biomedical Problems. A general concept of designing an autonomous water system for interplanetary spaceships is proposed. The system features a high reliability resulting from the mutual complement and partial or com- plete backup of the elements. The system consists of three intercon- nected subsystems: water-supplies, regenerative physicochemical and biological ones, each providing the crew with water during dif- ferent stages of a long-term space mission. The system is expected to be a further step in developing a closed- cycle, autonomous, biot- echnological life-support system. 941538. A comparison of power/weight/space requirements for water-recycling processors. Cal C. Herrmann, University of California; and Badawi Tleimat, Water Reuse Technology. Several quite different waste-water processing subsystems have been tested for space mission applications. Mission choice, and choice of priority for further development, involves processor requirements for (electrical) power, launch and resupply weights, and space occupied, and developmental factors of reliability and repairability. For each subsystem one can identify theoretical power, etc., requirements, and current realistic requirements, and potential realistic subsystem requirements. Compared are reverse osmosis, 192</page><page sequence="192">941538-941545 vapor-compression-distillation, and TIMES processes, in terms of power, weight, and space requirements. Discussions of electrodialy- sis and CELSS are included as components of water treatment sys- tems. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941539. Higher plant growth in closed environment: produc- tion of nitrous oxide by radishes is governed by the light regi- men. Peter Thomsen, University of Copenhagen ; and Christian Tamponnet, ESTEC. All living creatures, plants included, are producing gaseous con- taminants that may be harmful either to other living systems, man included, or even to themselves. Indeed, these contaminants have a tendency to accumulate when plants producing them are placed in a closed environment such as a space station and/or planetary base. Therefore, a non-negligible part of Life Support Research and Development is dedicated to the degradation of these contaminants through physico-chemical or biological means. Radishes have been cultivated in the closed air loop bench of the Life Support Facility at ESTEC to verify that such a production of contaminants by plants existed. The production of nitrous oxide (N2O) by the radishes was clearly demonstrated when plants were grown under constant illumination. However, no production of such gaseous contaminant (N2O) was shown when the radishes were cul- tivated under an imposed light-dark cycle (LD:16/8). The metabolic origin of such a remarkable result is discussed. 941540. Plant cultivation experiments for CEEF. A. Toki, S. Kosaka, and N. Takama, CHIYODA Corp.; and K. Nitta, Institute for Environmental Sciences. A Closed Environmental Experiment Facility (CEEF) is a facility with an objective of the implementation of various experiments in order to practically study appropriate conditions to persons' long- term living in a closed space without any intake and discharge of materials. The detail design has been accomplished, and its con- struction is scheduled to launch within the fiscal year 1994. It will be operated by the Institute for Environmental Science with the financial support of the Japanese Government. The Facility contains a habitat module, an animal feeding mod- ule, a plantation module and thaifiife support systems. The Planta- tion module is a facility where plants are cultivated to provide a per- son with food by hydroponics. At the present time seven kinds of plants are nominated as candidates to be cultivated there; rice, soy- bean, sesame, tomato, komatsuna (Japanese tender green mustard), potato and soba. Preliminary experiments were carried out to obtain the data nec- essary for the future hydroponie cultivation in CEEF, since some of these candidate plants have not been cultivated throughout the whole process from seeding to harvesting by hydroponics. This paper mainly describes the intermediate results of the pre- liminary experiments. 941541. Energy and volume costs for growing plants in a closed environment. Antonios I. Zografos and Boris Yendler, Bionetics Corp. This paper employs a simplified model of an air conditioning and delivery system, and a lighting source to calculate the energy and volume costs associated with growing plants in a closed environ- ment. Some empirical data, drawn from the testing of the Ener- gineering Development Unit of the CELSS Test Facility have been incorporated in the model. The analysis of the results suggests that operating requirements imposed upon a similar system need to be carefully examined in terms of their energy and volume costs, as these may be substantial, particularly under Space Flight conditions. 941542. Preliminary test results from the CELSS test facility engineering development unit. M. Kliss and R. D. MacElroy, NASA ; and C. C. Blackwell, B. A. Borchers, M. E. Drews, J. R. Lon- gabaugh, B. S. Yendler, and A. I. Zografos, Bionetics Corp. As part of the NASA Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) Program, a CELSS Test Facility (CTF) is being planned for installation on the Space Station. The CTF will be used to pro- vide data on the productivity and efficiency of a variety of CELSS higher plant crops grown in the microgravity environment of the Space Station. Tight environmental control will be maintained while data on gas exchange rates and biomass accumulation rates are col- lected. In order to obtain an early realistic determination of the sub- system and system requirements necessary to provide the environ- mental conditions specified for CTF crop productivity experiments, an Engineering Development Unit (EDU) has been designed, con- structed and is in the process of subsystem and system testing at NASA Ames Research Center. The EDU is a ground-based test-bed which will be used to characterize the integrated performance of major subsystem technologies, to evaluate hardware candidates and control strategies required for the CTF, and to further define the ability to meet CTF requirements within present Space Station con- straints. This paper reviews the functional requirements for the EDU, and focuses on the performance evaluation and test results of the various subsystems. Preliminary integrated performance results and control system operation are addressed, and plans for future sci- ence and technology testing are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941543. Condensate recycling in closed plant growth cham- bers. R. E. Fortson and J. O. Bledsoe, Bionetics Corp.; and J. C. Sager, NASA. Water used in the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) Breadboard Project at the Kennedy Space Center is being recycled. Condensation is collected in the air ducts, filtered and deionized, and resupplied to the system for nutrient solutions, sup- plemental humidification, solvents and diluents. While the system functions well from a process control standpoint, precise and accu- rate tracking of water movement through the system to answer plant physiological questions is not consistent. Possible causes include hardware errors, undetected vapor loss from chamber leakage, and unmeasured changes in water volume in the plant growth trays. 941544. The C23A system: a tool for global control of plant environment and exchange measurements. V. Fabreguettes, F. Gibiat, J. Pintena, D. Vidal, and M. André, Centre de Cadarache. The C23A (Chambres de Culture Automatiques en Atmosphère Artificielle) System is composed of a group of plant growth cham- bers (six 700 liters modules designed for the study of canopies, and four 8 to 20 liters chambers for studies on individual plants) used for research in plant physiology. The basic principles of the system (air tightness, measurements apparatus sharing associated with chamber twinning...) which allow the continuous measurement of physiological activities are exposed. The general design of the chambers, the temperature and hygrometry control, the CO2 regula- tion and the computing system are described. Specific devices which have been implemented in several chambers for special pur- poses are presented to illustrate the large variety of capabilities of the system. 941545. P-Mass and PGBA: two new hardware developments for growing plants in space. Alexander Hoehn, University of Colo- rado; Mark H. Kliss, NASA; and Marvin W. Luttges, Michael C. Robinson, and Louis S. Stodieck, University of Colorado. Plant growth, and especially plant performance experiments in microgravity are limited by the currently available plant growth facilities (low light levels, inadequate nutrient delivery and atmo- sphere conditioning systems, insufficient science instrumentation, infrequent flight opportunities). In addition, mission durations of 10 to 14 days aboard the NSTS Space Shuttle allow for only brief peri- ods of microgravity exposure with respect to the life cycle of a plant. Based on seed germination experiements (5 missions from 1992 - 1994), using the Generic BioProcessing Apparatus hadware (GB A), two new payloads have been designed specifically for plant growth. 193</page><page sequence="193">941545-941551 These payloads provide new opportunities for plant gravitational and space biology research and emphasize the investigaiton of plant performance (photosynthesis, biomass accumulation) in micro- gravity. The Plant-Module for Autonomous Space Support (P-MASS) was designed to utilize microgravitgy exposure times in excess of 30 days on the first flight of the recoverable COMET sta- telitte (Commercial Experiment Transporter). The Plant-Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (P-GBA), is designed for the NSTS Space Shuttle middeck and the SPACEHAB environment. The P-GBA is an evolution from the GBA hardware (containment structure modi- fied for double-middeck locker size to increase available volume and power for plant growth) and P-MASS (plant chamber and instrumentation). The available light levels of both payloads more than double currently available capabilities. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941546. Seed germination and early plant morphology - Results from three microgravity missions. Alexander Hoehn, Marvin W. Luttges, and Louis S. Slodieck , University of Colorado. Alfalfa, clover, lettuce and periwinkle seedlings were grown from seeds during five Space Shuttle missions between 1992 and 1994. Germination was initiated on orbit. Selected plants were fixed on orbit by injecting a glutaraldehyde fixative. More than 1,000 seedlings have been grown for periods ranging from 2 to 12 days. Plants were germinated under low light conditions ( 1 mission) and in the dark (4 missions). The seedlings grown under low light conditions showed no sig- nificant differences in accumulated fresh mass or plant geometry between flight and ground. The plumular hook had developed both for alfalfa and clover plants. Hook opening and greening of plants occurred after the seedling penetrated the Rockwool™ substratum and were exposed to light. Microgravity seedlings exhibited an increase in curvature and bending and some plants were 'disori- ented' in that the roots had grown into the air space above the growth medium. Plants grown in darkness and microgravity had overall lower mass and were smaller than the corresponding ground control sam- ples, especially after longer growth periods (&gt;5 days). Hypocotyl hook development proceeded normally for alfalfa and clover. In let- tuce, hook formation did not occur for some plants depending on the orientation of the seed inside the substratum. 941547. Thermal control of spacecraft mountings and inter- faces: a review. Donald F. Gluck, Aerospace Corp.; and Mary E. Corrigan, Phillips Laboratory. Heat dissipated in conduction cooled spacecraft components must be transported across the component base plate/spacecraft mounting plate interface preparatory to final radiation to the space sink. Proper engineering requires that this be accomplished in read- ily predictable ways, with small temperature differentials, using reli- able and practical hardware. This paper conducts a review of the subject and provides design guidance. Areas covered are back- ground and general principles; conductance of bare interfaces (or joints) under uniform pressure; conductance of bare bolted joints; thermal/structural analysis; conductance of bolted joints with ther- mal enhancement fillers. In addition, the review deals with a variety of special mountings, such as honeycomb panels and thermal dou- blers, and with a number of bolt patterns. The approach taken is that of division of the mounting region into a region near the bolt where contact occurs between the plates, with the remainder a region, lack- ing contact, governed by lateral conductance. Both for the contact region and the overall region- for bare joints and those filled with a thermal gasket or RTV compound-empirical correlations, test data and/or investigator recommendations are provided for predict- ing heat transfer coefficients and conductances. Design guidance is provided for both thin rectangular doublers where it is assumed that the additional contact conductance due to the doubler can be ignored, and thick axisymmetric doublers where the additional con- tact conductance is considered. 941548. On-orbit thermal performance testing of the explorer platform. Catherine Penafiel, Loral AeroSys; David Was- son and William Ducas, Fairchild Space and Defense Corp.; and We s Ousley, NASA. In order to characterize the thermal performance of the spacecraft at attitudes beyond initial constraints and to expand the operational envelope, on-orbit testing was performed. Plans and tradeoffs in pre- paring for the testing are discussed. Results are presented and com- pared with analytical predictions. Although the pay load and bus sections were the only separately thermal vacuum tested prior to flight, results from the on-orbit test- ing indicate the integrated thermal design is robust. One thermal anomaly was discovered which is attributed to specular reflection from a radiator. The influence of the on-orbit testing results on spacecraft continuing operations is also discussed. 941549. Thermal design, analysis, testing, and on-orbit per- formance of the Inmarsat 2 spacecraft. J. V. Gallagher, Inmarsat; and P. D. McGoldrick and M. A. Smith, British Aerospace. The Inmarsat 2 spacecraft constellation consists of four operating spacecraft, with the first launched in October 1990. The spacecraft thermal design was modeled and validated through an extensive test program, which included solar thermal vacuum tests. Additionally, an on-orbit thermal balance test was performed on the protoflight spacecraft, and the results were compared to thermal model predic- tions. On-station thermal performance has been excellent, with the exception of the infrared earth sensors, which required design modi- fications for later flights. Lower than expected solar absorptance degradation has been minimal on the thermal radiators. Evidence of hot soakback from liquid apogee engine firings were observed dur- ing transfer orbit. Results of the Inmarsat 2 program demonstrate that detailed modeling and a comprehensive test program will pro- duce a reliable thermal control system. 941550. Thermal design of the SPAS spacecraft for the SPAS III mission. F. DeMauro and F. J. Harvatine, Fairchild Space and Defense Corp. The SPAS (Shuttle Pallet Satellite) is a battery powered, three- axis stabilized spacecraft which provides mechanical interface, power, command, low rate telemetry and high density data storage. A reconfigured SPAS for the SPAS III mission has been defined which includes new avionics and power subsystems, a modified communications subsystem, a Global Positioning System receiver, and a new sensor suite. The primary sensors are an IR (Infrared) Radiometer, an IR Spectrometer, a Multi-Spectral Imager/ Spectrometer and two television cameras. The SPAS is deployed from the STS (Space Transportation System) orbiter for approxi- mately four days, controlled with either ground or astronaut com- mands, and then retrieved. Due to its externally mounted sensors and components, and widely varying possible orbital attitudes and mission conditions, the SPAS presented a challenging thermal design opportunity. This paper describes the design approach, problems encountered in the design process, and final thermal design. The thermal modeling of the SPAS is discussed. Flight temperature predictions are also included for both STS attached and free flyer mission phases. 941551. Koreasat - A thermal desigh challenge. Han Hwangbo and Heedae Kim, Korea Telecom; Thomas McCarthy, Martin Marietta Astro Space; and Surinder Paul Sharma and Wil- liam H. Kelly, COMSAT. The Koreasat satellite being developed by Martin Marietta Astro Space for Korea Telecom is the first domestic commercial satellite providing both direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service and fixed sat- ellite service (FSS). The power dissipation level of three of the six 120W DBS TWTAs coupled with twelve of the sixteen 14W FSS TWTAs becomes evident that the network of heat pipes to "isothermalize" the pay load panel is necessary. 194</page><page sequence="194">941551-941558 Extensive tradeoff studies to optimize the heat pipe layouts for the communication equipment are reviewed. Design features of the selected heat pipes and the unique testing program to validate their performance at the unit and at the tran- sponder level are reviewed. The mission requirements and analyses for various payload oper- ations, including eclipse operations, are reviewed. The satellite analytical prediction techniques and testing program are reviewed in detail. Based on the on-orbit thermal performance of other commercial satellite programs, a number of thermal design improvements on the Koreasat satellite are reviewed. 941552. Thermal design of a high-power C-band phased array with integral MMIC amplifiers. W. H. Kelly, G. Albright, I. Yogev, and M. Zaharovits, COMSAT Laboratories. The thermal design of a high-power C-band phased array with integral solid- state amplifiers, and its integration into a three-axis- stabilized spacecraft, are discussed. A thermal design has been developed employing fixed- conductance heat pipes and an embed- ded heat pipe radiator panel. The design tradeoffs and problems encountered in removing 2,000 W from a 1-m-diameter array are described, and possible solutions are presented. The highly concen- trated heat source associated with solid-state amplifiers has empha- sized the importance of minimizing MMIC chip internal thermal resistance in terms of the overall thermal control subsystem weight. Thermal test verification issues and concerns with 1-g operation in integrated spacecraft testing are also addressed. 941553. International EVA systems - Interoperability status. A. Ingemar Skoog, Dornier/Dasa; James W. McBarron, NASA ; Guy I. Severin, RD&amp;PE Zvezda; Richard C. Wilde, UTC/Hamilton Stan- dard; and Isaac P. Abramov, RD&amp;PE Zvezda. The European Agency (ESA) and the Russian Space Agency (RKA) are jointly developing a new space suit system for improved extravehicular activity (EVA) capabilities in support of the MIR 2 Space Station Program, the EVA Suit 2000. Recent national policy agreements between the U.S. and Russia on planned cooperations in manned space also propose the development of a common space suit system for potential use with the International Space Station. It is thus timely to report the current status of ongoing work on international EVA interoperability being conducted by the Commit- tee on EVA Protocols and Operations of the International Academy of Astronautics initiated in 1991. This paper summarizes the current EVA interoperability issues to be resolved and presents quantified vehicle interface requirements for the current U.S. Shuttle EMU and Russian MIR Orlan DMA and the new European/Russian EVA Suit 2000 extravehicular systems. An assessment of compatibility for combinations of suits/ mothercraft has been performed, and preliminary recommendations to remedy incompatibilities are given. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941554. In-flight maintainability for an advanced extravehic- ular mobility unit: key to system availability. Philip A. Landis, Charles H. Simonds, and Richard G. Stinson, Lockheed Engineering &amp; Sciences Co. A high degree of in-flight availability of an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) must be assured to allow Extravehicular Activity (EVA) to become a routine operation, to minimize life cycle costs, and to support long duration missions. The ability to maintain an Advanced EMU and other equipment in flight will be of primary importance in achieving these high availability require- ments while minimizing onboard spares quantities and resupply costs. This paper presents an analytical assessment of the advan- tages of in-flight maintainability in providing continued EMU avail- ability for space-based operations by use of modular assemblies and components. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941555. EVA Suit 2000 maintenance concept. M. Diener, Dor- nier/Dasa; and M. Balashov, RD&amp;PE Zvezda. Since 1 992 studies were conducted to define a common Europe- an/Russian Space Suit to replace the Russian space suit Orlan-DMA and the former planned European Hermes EVA space suit. This EVA Suit 2000 is a joint development initiated by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian Space Agency (RKA). The utilization scenario foresees space based missions where the suits are permanently stationed on-board a space station. Through- out this mission duration, reliability and availability of the space suits have to be maintained. A concept for preventive and corrective maintenance was developed which is closely linked to the EVA Suit 2000 technical baseline and applied technologies. Russian experi- ence gained with the present Extravehicular Activity (EVA) suit on the Mir space station and extensive application of European technol- ogies shall be applied to achieve these ambitious mission require- ments. This paper presents the systems technical configuration, the cur- rent status of this maintenance concept and the relevant technical development results. Maintenance implications from the technical baseline are discussed using typical examples of EVA Suit 2000 assemblies and components. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941556. Good use of flight crew time - A guiding principle for EVA system design. Edward W. Hodgson and Richard C. Wilde, Hamilton Standard Space Systems International, Inc.; and Richard K. Fullerton, NASA. A fresh look at the use of astronaut time to conduct and support Extravehicular Activity (EVA) can help guide the evolution of next generation EVA systems. Studies have shown that less than 20% of the flight crew time for EVA (prior/during/post) is currently spent directly on productive tasks. In the future, longer missions, larger and more complex orbiting platforms and on-orbit maintenance of EVA equipment will drive this percentage even lower. Study of where the remaining 80% of the flight crew time presently goes indicates where improvements could be aggressively pursued for next generation systems. With the high cost per manhour on orbit, and estimated needs for 200 or more crew hours of EVA annually for space station, these improvements are clearly worthwhile. Current use of crew time before, during and after EVA were ana- lyzed, and major uses of time identified. Some specific areas high- lighted include IV support, servicing and checkout, prebreathe, tool management, and translation and position maintenance. Careful attention to these elements in an integrated, total EVA system defi- nition could significantly reduce the unproductive expenditures of a precious resource. This will allow our future space missions to be more productive as well as faster, better and cheaper. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941557. EVA hazards comparison. William E. Haynes, Right Consortium LLC. Extravehicular Activity (EVA) for space operations is essential but use is inhibited by the hazard associated with it. EVA's impor- tance to future projects mean assessment of its danger should be based on facts, not individual perceptions. This study surveyed data on EVA as conducted by US astronauts and Russian cosmonauts, documented the EVA experience and compared EVA to similar human activities of comparable difficulty and danger. This was to establish a basis for estimating the long term hazard level of EVA in the absence of adequate statistical data for EVA, per se. The results are tabulated and some conclusions drawn. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941558. Computer Aided Design and graphics techniques for EVA analysis. Larry R. Price, Michael A. Fruhwirth, and Jeffrey G. Knutson, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. The size and complexity of Space Station has driven the need for an accurate, reliable analytical tool to assess the extravehicular activity (EVA) crew interfaces at the worksite. On previous space- 195</page><page sequence="195">941558-941564 craft, each worksite was developed and validated through Neutral Buoyancy underwater testing by the crew using mockups. For spacecraft requiring a significant amount of EVA over large areas, like Space Station, the cost of conducting underwater tests for each of the many hundred worksites becomes prohibitive. Therefore, lim- ited testing must be augmented by accurate graphical analysis. The Unigraphics II, which is the Computer Aided Design (CAD) system for the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) Product Group 1 design, was selected and developed. It has a major advan- tage of easy and rapid access to the accurate and updated Space Sta- tion design. The design can be rapidly obtained electronically from layouts, detail drawings, assembly drawings or the Electronic Development Fixture (EDF). Also, it allows the structures and mechanical designers to do preliminary worksite layout on the same system they use for design, In addition, several separate models (files) for EVA constraints, support equipment and Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) have been developed so that a particular worksite can be evaluated for access, reach, work envelope and viewing. It lacks some features that other graphics programs such as McDonnell Douglas Human Modeling Systems (MDHMS) have, which are: animation, easy graphics manipulation and built-in anthropometric data. This UGII technique has been developed and refined over several years (&gt;100 worksites analyzed) and has achieved very high correla- tion to underwater tests' results for worksites on the exterior of the truss. The use of this tool has become a routine but still informal part of the design process. Utilization for verification is another goal which will require further correlation testing utilizing neutral buoy- ancy and other micro gravity simulation techniques to demonstrate adequate accuracy. The development of an improved graphics computer program to provide refined animation with anthropometric simulation for the EVA crew person is also discussed. An existing shirt-sleeve human task analysis computer program, MDHMS is being modified to per- mit detailed reach, access and viewing analysis of an EMU suited crew member. The effects of zero gravity and the constraints imposed by the EMU are also addressed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941559. Shuttle EMU 25 EVA manned chamber testing - Endurance validated. Monica Krasiński, James R. Gustaf son, and Scott Schneider, Hamilton Standard Space Systems International, Inc.; and Glenn C. Lutz, NASA. To support expected Space Station Extravehicular Activity (EVA) requirements, the Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) performance capability must provide a much greater opera- tional endurance than was originally required for the Space Shuttle Program: 25 EVAs in 180 days versus up to 3 EVAs in 15 days, all without servicing on earth. Recently, the Shuttle EMU has success- fully completed a 25 EVA manned vacuum chamber test series which is the culmination of an endurance demonstration that also included Life Extension Testing of certain life limited components and unmanned life support system chamber testing. This paper discusses laboratory component endurance life test- ing, manned one-atmosphere suit testing, unmanned chamber test- ing as well as 25 EVA manned vacuum chamber testing. Emphasis will be placed upon test philosophy, test objectives, hardware uti- lized, problems encountered, solutions developed during testing and test team organization. Notable test objectives include the verifica- tion of EMU performance with anticipated reprocessed Space Sta- tion water as an EVA consumable, successful microbial growth con- trol and verification of hygiene procedures throughout the simulated mission period. 941560. Thermal model correlation using design sensitivity and optimization techniques. F. J. Harvatine and F. DeMauro, Fairchild Space and Defense Corp. An automated procedure has been developed for correlating ther- mal models with test or flight data. The procedure achieves model correlation by determining the best combination of changes to a model's linear and non-linear conductors in order to minimize the differences between model temperature predictions and measured data. This procedure has been developed for use with the SINDA Thermal analyzer program, but the methods are general and apply equally to other thermal programs, such as ESATAN. The method is based on Design Sensitivity and Optimization techniques and uti- lizes the solution sequences available in MSC/NASTRAN. The thermal model is reformulated into an equivalent structural model, which is then optimized using built-in MSC/NASTRAN routines to match specified results. 941561. Microcomputer Spacecraft Thermal Analysis Rou- tines (MST AR) Phase 1 &amp; II: the geometric model generator. Nicholas M. Teti, Swales and Associates, Inc. The Microcomputer Spacecraft Thermal Analysis Routines (MSTAR) software package is being developed for NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center by Swales and Associates, Inc. (S&amp;AI). MSTAR is intended to replace the currently used thermal analysis programs SSPTA, VIEW, and TRASYS. These software packages contain solution algorithms developed as much as 25 years ago. Many of the algorithms used in these programs are based on soft- ware and hardware available at that time. In recent years, the com- puter industry has made tremendous technological advances in pro- viding powerful yet inexpensive desktop computers capable of com- peting with small mainframe computers. In June 1993, SAI com- pleted the Phase I effort on the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract awarded from NASA to develop MSTAR. 941562. Tridimensional temperature map interpolation for spacecraft thermoelastic analysis. François Dubrulle and Patrice Renard, Matra Marconi Space. In space engineerings thorough thermal analysis on a spacecraft is necessary to evaluate structural stresses, and above all therm- oelastic displacements (e.g. instrument pointing). The main problem of such an analysis lies in the fact that thermal and mechanical engineers do not use the same software tools. Thermal loadcases on structural models are all the more difficult to obtain that models become more and more complex. Interpolating temperatures by hand is now tedious and an inaccurate task. MATRA MARCONI SPACE recently developed an original tool that can automatically interpolate a 3D temperature map. This tool, in the very near future, will make thermal and mechan- ical engineers work together without throwing back into questions their methodologies for solving this kind of problem. 941563. ES ARAD recent improvements; a user's viewpoint. C. Gomez Hernandez, ESTEC; R. Bisanz, Dornier GmbH; and P. T. Warren, European Gas Turbines. The ESARAD radiative analysis program has been in use in the European thermal analysis community for approximately two years. The first part of this paper presents an assessment of ESARAD from a user's viewpoint. The second part presents work related to ESARAD performed in the Thermal Control and Life Support Divi- sion of ESTEC. In particular, work relating to two topics is pres- ented: 1) ESARAD programming - a set of add-on software routines developed to complement ESARAD' s basic capabilities is pres- ented. 2) ESARAD applications - two thermal analysis problems from the ENVISAT-1 and XMM spacecraft are presented. The last part of the paper is a brief description of the status of accuracy con- trol in ESARAD. 941564. Crystal: a method and software package to project steady state conditions of a product using transient monotonie or cyclic data. Jean-Pierre F. A. Bouchez, INTELSAT; and Jeffrey A. Robinson, COMSAT Corp. 196</page><page sequence="196">941564-941569 A novel analytical procedure for projecting the steady state con- ditions of transient data is presented. In addition to the basic applica- tion of the method to monotonically changing date, this method has been extended to the case of cyclic data, for which only a coarse cyclic pattern is required to project cyclicly repeatable maximum and minimum expected values. The procedure which has been implemented, using the commer- cial software LOTUS 1-2-3 Version 3.1 on an IBM PC, is easily transportable and can conveniently be used at a test site. Results from application to satellite solar beam test temperature data are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the method and the atten- dant potential for test time savings. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941565. The use of an expert system for the feasibility study and the preliminary design of an experiment in a space furnace. H. Ben Aim , CNES ; B. Desaunettes and A. Kessaci, EPSILON; and T. Duffar, CENG. CNES engineering department has a long experience in space furnace design (GHF, MEPHISTO, MULTIZONE, AGHF, etc.) and in the development of their respective experiments. An Expert Sys- tem (E.S.) known as ' 'CARTOUCHE' ' has been developed to check the feasibility and to assist the conception of fusion/solidification experiment cartridges assigned to any axisymmetrical Bridgman type furnace. It will be validated with an ESA furnace, the AGHF (Advanced Gradient Heating Facility), designed for crystal growth and generally for directional solidification experiments up to 1400°C. The furnace consists in a heated section separated from the cooled heat extraction section by a large adiabatic zone. The furnace assembly can be moved along the sample which remains static. So far, five European experiments are to be carried out. The E.S. is based on a materials data base and the knowledge of multi-experts (scientists, furnace designers, safety specialists), and it includes sophisticated thermal modeling software (ESATAN) to take some constraints into account. Then, the E.S. supplies the following results: • The feasibility of the experiment according to the sample and the furnace. • The geometrical characteristics of the sample and of the cruci- ble, their optimum position in the furnace, the cartridge envelope material, the best way of cooling, the minimum power consumption, etc. Following this, a nodal mesh of the cartridge and a list of the appropriate materials are proposed. These will enable the designer to fill the cartridge core parts (spring, thermal conduction parts, super insulation, atmosphere, etc.). The temperature and thermal flux at each node, as well as the thermal profile versus time required in the furnace, are then calcu- lated by ESATAN. The designer is thus able to achieve, by succes- sive iterations, a suitably optimized cartridge. 941566. Columbus APM TCS design and development status. Michele Trie hilo, Paolo Oberlo, and Andrea Baudino, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. The redesign of Space Station Freedom (SSF) and the require- ment of the Columbus program board to reduce costs have led ESA to change the design and development strategy of the Attached Pres- surized Module (APM). A revised APM reference design for inte- gration with the SSF Alpha has been produced with sufficient flexi- bility to allow adaptation as part of a global space station or to per- mit operations as part of a European Free Flyer. The main objectives of the redesign have been to simplify the design, reduce the costs and provide increased autonomy from the SSF. The key groundrules for the redesign have been an AR5/ATV launch from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CGS) into an orbit inclined at 51.6 degrees. The APM has a length equivalent to 5 double racks and a net launch mass of 1200 kg. It will be delivered to the SSF at an altitude of 407 km for a 10- year operational life. Safe disposal will be by ATV. The Thermal Control Subsystem architecture maintains a moderate tem- perature loop for transportation of waste heat from subsystem cold- plates and payloads,and a low temperature loop to remove heat from the ECLSS condensing heat exchanger and cold payloads. Each loop interfaces with a separate heat exchanger of the SSF. Only two pumps will be used, in contrast with previous design. In the event of pump failure, operations can continue in a single loop configura- tion with SSF heat exchangers in series. Potential alternative solu- tions are under evaluation to guarantee the maximum payload sup- port capability after a pump failure and avoid the necessity of loop reconfiguration. The necessity to have a lighter APM-5 implies a reduced mass target for TCS components, whose design has been reviewed with the objective of mass saving. 941567. Thermal control issues of a European unwinged main transportation system. Claudio Ferro, Fabrizio Burgio, and Adolfo Russo, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. In the frame of HERMES re-orientation activities, a set of studies has been started to define the most suitable scenario for a Man Transportation System (MTS). The possibility to use a non-winged vehicle to cope with differ- ent missions and requirements has been widely investigated, in a competitive study lead by Alenia Spazio as System responsible and performed in collaboration with Dassault Aviation. The study has concentrated first on the selection, from a large number of candidate shapes, of 2 promising vehicle concepts, one in the family of blunt bodies and one in the family of slender bodies. Then the design of the two selected shapes and the assessments of their expected per- formances have been investigated in grater detail in order to consoli- date and validate the conclusions of the trade-offs performed during the first part of the study. This paper focuses on the thermal control issues of the two selected vehicle shapes. In particular, the following aspects are dis- cussed: • implications of the high thermal fluxes encountered by both vehicles during atmospheric re-entry, • implementation of the Fail Operational/Fail Safe requirement by means of an asymmetrical architecture of the Active Thermal Control Section of the Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS), • interrelationships between the selected TCS architecture and the architecture of the on-board electrical/electronic subsystems (namely the avionics and the Electrical Power Supply subsystem) and relevant operational implications. Finally, the envisaged architecture of the Environmental Control and Life Support Subsystem (ECLSS) is presented. 941568. Thermal orbital performance of the Hubble Space Telescope solar arrays. G. I. M. Beere, European Space Agency - ESTEC ; and R. G. Turner, British Aerospace Space Systems, Ltd. The NASA Hubble Space Telescope was launched in April 1990 with the ESA/BAE Solar Arrays. In December 1993, the in-orbit Servicing Mission was performed which included the replacement of the original pair of arrays. This paper provides an overview of the thermal design and per- formance aspects of these arrays throughout this enterprise includ- ing one of the design modifications to reduce the disturbance caused by the thermal transient behavior of the array bi-stems at entry and exit from eclipse. Some aspects from the above experience are noted for reference for the future. 941569. EURECA post-flight inspection: observations on external surfaces cooling loop. M. N. De Parolis and G. Racca, ESA/ESTEC. In parallel to the detailed quantitative analyses performed by ERNO and ESTEC Material Division (subject of another paper), ESTEC carried out a thermal visual inspection of EURECA thermal control hardware aiming at understanding what kind of impact the LEO environment can have on materials and design configurations. 197</page><page sequence="197">941569-941577 The first part of the paper deals with the findings of the inspec- tion. A brief description of the EURECA TCS design is given first, followed by the observations on the after-flight configuration. Some discrepancies between the as-designed and as-built configurations as well as the impact of the orbital environment on the hardware characteristics are the most significant outcome of the inspection. The cooling loop and its components were not directly inspected at ESTEC. The relevant activities are still on going at ERNO (EURECA prime contractor) and NASA. This paper includes all information available at the data of issue. Further results will be presented at the conference. 941570. Thermal accommodation of attached pressurized module payloads. U. Lawc, B. Behrens , and E. Gargioli, EURO- COLUMBUS; and C. Gastaldi , Alenia. The backbone of the Attached Pressurized Module (APM) is the water cooling loop, which contributes to an optimized payload oper- ation. Dedicated design means are proposed to allow an efficient use of this resource. In case of a Thermal Control System (TCS) failure a controlled run-down, of individual payloads is possible to avoid critical situa- tions like overheating due to heat soak back from a furnace. The TCS is flexible enough to allow short payload power peaks thus optimizing the resource allocation without violation of the thermal requirements regarding the temperature limits. The APM will be verified against generic thermal and environ- mental control requirements. The test and analytical verification effort on payload side is dependant whether the payload is a facility integrated in an International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) or a smaller entity like a drawer as subset of a facility or a self-standing experiment. 941571. Thermal design of space support equipment for the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. W es Ousley, NASA. During the First Servicing Mission for the Hubble Space Tele- scope, two replacement instruments and several spacecraft compo- nents were installed successfully. Most of the replacement hardware was carried up in protective enclosures that provided thermal control over a wide range of potential mission attitudes. Some items added late to the mission were protected by passive thermal systems and attitude constraints on the Shuttle. This paper focuses on thermal design challenges presented by the replacement hardware, enclo- sures, and carriers, and includes an assessment of flight thermal per- formance. 941572. European Polar Platform ENVISAT-1 mission: ther- mal design and payload thermal accommodation. S. Dolce, G. Spinella, P. Pieper, and C. Lusteau, ESA/ESTEC. The European Polar Platform is a remote sensing satellite with the primary objective, in the ENVISAT-1 P/L configuration, to monitor and study the earth and its environment. The platform thermal design is passive assisted by heaters. Exter- nally mounted P/Ls are responsible for their own thermal control and are required to be thermally decoupled from the platform. The P/L thermal design is largely dependent on their detectors required temperature and stability. A wide range of design solutions is found: Stirling cycle coolers, Peltier elements, passive radiant coolers, heat pipe radiators. This paper describes the overall thermal design of the platform and the P/Ls, the principles of the selected ENVISAT-1 P/L accom- modation, the relevant P/L to platform I/F design solutions and out- lines the platform and P/Ls thermal verification logic. 941573. Some evaluation methods and measures for over- coming the thermal non-design conditions during the spacecraft flight. Rostislav M. Kopiatkevitch and Nicolai A. Anfimov, TSNÍI- MASH ; and Oleg V. Surguchov, NPO "Energia". The thermal non-design conditions, or off-nominal situations concerned with the disturbances in operation of the passive and active means of temperature control are considered in paper. The possibilities of using of simplified fast-acting method of thermal state analysis are shown in specific examples. There is described the procedure of heating the orbital station "Salut- 6" after the power system failure. Other examples of non-design conditions are con- cerned with S/C "Venera" and "Sojuz". 941574. Impact on life time of "TWO-PHASE" heat transfer components. H. Kreeb, Dornier GmbH. The life time of "TWO-PHASE' -Loop components may be lim- ited by an inert gas generation. Non-condensing gas can be generated from three basic pro- cesses: • gas, trapped or adsorbed at structure material or solved in the heat carrier • gas, generated as a corrosion product • gas, generated by a decomposition of the heat carrier. In this paper, we describe the responsible influences for the gas generation and calculate the generation-rate of the gas production process according to a theoretical, physical model and compare it to test results. 941575. Loop Heat Pipes - Their performance and potential. David A. Wolf, Dynatherm, Inc.; Donald M. Ernst, DTK Corp.; and A. L. Phillips, Consultant. Loop Heat Pipes combine the advantages of both heat pipes and Capillary Pumped Loops, while overcoming the limitations of each. Loop Heat Pipes provide very high thermal transport capacities; they can transport heat over long distances, through small cross- sec- tional tubes and have the capillary pumping capacity to overcome high gravitational heads. Most of these features are available from capillary pumped loops (CPLs), but unlike CPLs, Loop Heat Pipes are inherently self priming and totally passive in operation. This paper describes the operating principles of Loop Heat Pipes, pro- vides performance data from hardware tests, describes some areas of ongoing development, and discusses applications, terrestrial as well as space, where Loop Heat Pipes could confer major benefits. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941576. Investigation of temperature control characteristics of Loop Heat Pipes. David A. Wolf and Walter B. Bienert, Dyna- therm Corp. Loop Heat Pipes have been shown to be reliable, self-starting, high capacity heat transport devices which offer significant perfor- mance improvements over conventional heat pipes. They are also capable of both constant and variable conductance operation, pro- viding both temperature control and heat transport functions. Two different Loop Heat Pipes were tested to characterize their temperature control capabilities. Operation in both a passive, autoregulating mode and an active control mode were investigated. The test results demonstrate that temperature regulation in each mode is attainable. The effects of the operational environment on temperature control characteristics were found to be important and are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941577. Investigation of temperature fluctuations in Loop Heat Pipes. K. A. Goncharov, E. Yu. Kotlyarov, and F. Yu. Smirnov, Lavochkin Association ; and R. Schlitt, K. Beckmann, R. Meyer, and R. Müller, DASA ERNO. Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) combine the classical heat pipe operation principle with a loop configuration, i.e., evaporator and condenser are located at separate places as dictated by thermal and configura- tional reasons and are connected lines for fluid and vapor transport. Experimental investigations of such LHP revealed certain tempera- ture oscillations under certain conditions. This paper presents the results of analyses of such temperature fluctuations and offers possi- ble explanations for initiation and termination of such behavior. 198</page><page sequence="198">941577-941586 Two types of temperature fluctuations have also been confirmed experimentally by testing different kinds of LHP. 941578. Methods of increase of the evaporators reliability for Loop Heat Pipes and Capillary Pumped Loops. E. Yu. Kotlyarov and G. P. Serov, Lavochkin Association. In this paper there are considered some differences between the Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) and the Capillary Pumped Loops (CPLs) performances. There offered the methods of the capillary evapora- tors reliability function increasing for two-phase systems of the LHP and the CPL type. The reliability increasing of above mentioned systems evaporators is proposed to be done by using of composite wicks and/or thermal electrical coolers. The recommended means could decrease the probability or except completely the "vapor blockade' of absorbing surface of evaporators capillary pumps. 941579. Circumferentially grooved heat pipes applied to a capillary pumped two-phase loop. Edson Bazzo, Federal Univer- sity of Santa Catarina; Manfred Groll and Ortwin Brost , Institut fur Kernenergetick und Energiesysteme; and Sergio Colle, Federal University of Santa Catarina. Circumferentially grooved heat pipe evaporators have been pro- posed as an alternative solution to obtain high capillary pressure and large liquid cross sections to reduce the viscous pressure losses in the liquid flow. Such evaporators have been employed in a capillary pumped two-phase loop and first results have been reported for loop operation in the mechanical pump assisted mode. Additional tests have been carried out in order to determine the performance of the loop also in the capillary pumped mode. Using freon 1 1 as the working fluid, heat fluxes up to 12 kW/m2 have been measured. For ammonia, the corresponding value is estimated to be about 78kW/m2. A theoretical analysis is also presented in order to understand differing performances of the individual capillary pumps. 941580. Waste heat driven solid sorption coolers. L. L. Vasi- liev, L. E. Kanonchick, A. A. Antux, and A. G. Kulakov, Luikov Heat &amp; Mass Transfer Institute; and I. Rosin, Thermacore, Inc. This paper provides a focus on the R &amp; D of solid sorption cool- ers and heat pumps made in the Luikov Heat &amp; Mass Transfer Insti- tute (CIS Countries Association "Heat Pipes") under Thermacore, Inc. Agreement. Commercial and space applications of sorbent systems offer an attractive alternative to compression systems and liquid sorption system in cooling, heating and air conditioning. The key elements of solid sorption machines are the chemical compressors-adsorbers. Two categories of solid sorption system are analyzed: adsorbents (MgA, NaX zeolites, carbon fiber "Busofit" with water, acetone, NH3), and compounds with chemical reaction and physical adsorption (CaCL2 + carbon fiber "Busofit" with NH3). These systems differ in one very important aspect: the adsorp- tion equilibrium is bivariant, chemical reaction is monovariant. Some promising results with zeolite- water and NH3, 4 'Busofiť ' with acetone and NH3 are received. Solid sorption heat pump technology utilizing heat pipe heat recovery with a condensing/evaporating refrigerant holds consider- able promise for bivariant (space and domestic) applications due to the variable temperature and variable load capabilities of such machines. 941581. Status on T.P.S. integrated hot skin antenna. Thibault Arnold, Robert Comet, and Thierry Pichón, SEP. This paper presents the status of the telecommunication antennas that have been designed and manufactured within the development of the HERMES shuttle Rigid External Insulation. From the prelimi- nary radio-frequency tests at high temperature to the complete C/SiC shingle antenna prototype, the design drivers, evaluation tests and manufacturing choices are discussed. Technical aspects are focused on thermal and mechanical compromises. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941582. Thermomechanical tests on CMC samples and heat shingle in oxidizing environment. Ulrich Trabandì and Wilfried Becker, Dornie r GmbH; and Alain P radier, ESTEC. On three different materials, C/C, C/SiC and Sic/Sic, bending tests under thermomechanical cycles have been performed, in accor- dance with the thermal load conditions of hypersonic launch and re- entry. The samples have been manufactured with oxidation protec- tive coatings in order to investigate also the effect of oxidizing envi- ronment. In order to assess the influence of initial defects the test samples have been prepared with different drilled holes. Thereby, high sensi- tivity with respect to the initial defect size can be stated. Eventually, as an actual structural component a C/SiC heat shin- gle has been manufactured and is going to be validated. 941583. Wing leading edges for air breathing launchers. G. Reich and U. Trabandt, Dornier GmbH; and K. Keller, ESTEC. Actively cooled and re-radiative leading edges were investigated as typical thermal protection elements for thermally high loaded areas of advanced launchers. A performance trade-off led to the selection of a C/SiC thermostructural concept. Mechanical and ther- mal analyses demonstrated the adequacy of the selected design. Manufacturing leading edge demonstrators with a small nose radius, different thicknesses of the outer skin and the integration of stringers was realized with good surface smoothness and contour accuracy. Thermal cycle tests with temperatures up to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment were performed without any visible damage. 941584. Thermal property models applied to re-entry space- craft materials. Drik Schwingel, ESTEC; and Klaus lffländer, Con- sultant. The durability of ceramic is limited due to chemical reactions with the atmosphere and due to sublimation. Another aspect of the ceramic composites are their non- isotropic mechanical and thermal characteristics. Models for both the erosion and the heat transport properties have been established. These mod- els were validated by comparison with experimental results. Appli- cations to different design problems are shown. 941585. Design and in-orbit performance of the heat shield insulation for liquid apogee motor of INSAT-2A and INSAT-2B. R. S. Bhide and V. K. Kaila, ISRO Satellite Centre. A super insulated (multi layer insulation) heat shield has been designed and implemented for the 440 N Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) of INSAT-2A and INSAT-2B satellites. The design has arrived at its final configuration after a series of tests and detailed analysis of the test data. An effective conductivity and emissivity for the shield insulation assembly was estimated and used for pre- dicting the flight performance. 941586. Methodology and results of catalycity and plasma erosion tests on FEI components. V. V. Shvedchenko and B. Eu. Zhestkov, TsAGI; and W. P. P. Fischer and W.-D. Ebeling, Deut- sche Aerospace. A Flexible External Insulation (FEI) is being developed for the thermal protection of spaceplanes and re-entry capsules. Presently, forward extension of the FEI to locations of higher aerothermal loads is being studied. To evaluate the FEI under simulated re-entry conditions a test campaign has been planned and performed by the Rarefied Gas Dynamics Laboratory of the Russian Central Aerohy- drodynamic Institute (TsAGI). Coated and non-coated FEI fabrics were exposed to a hypersonic high-enthalpy air flow in the VAT- 104 plasma wind tunnel. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 199</page><page sequence="199">941587-941593 941587. Modular rack design for multiple users. Ramzy Boutros, Boeing Co.; Jay Cory, Johnson Engineering; and Mark Beasley, Boeing Co. The space station program was faced with a unique design environment - to design a common systems and payload support structure that could accommodate changeout for repair or technol- ogy growth over a 30-year lifetime. The vibration environment and weight allocation for rack structure necessitated a lightweight, yet stiff structure. The design answer was a modular rack structure using graphite/epoxy composites and selected aluminum components that could support a wide variety of systems, payload and stowage func- tions. A modular set of mounting locations allow the installation of a wide variety of secondary structures without permanent modifica- tions to the rack. Aircraft-style seat track rails on the front edges of the rack permit attachment of handrails, foot restraints and accesso- ries such as lights, fans, clipboards or computers to the rack face. The utility interface panel accommodates reconfiguration of the lines into a rack when rack-mounted hardware is updated, replaced or repaired. This paper describes the rack available to users, the packaging interfaces, and the modular features of the rack. It also traces the development history of the rack structure and provides some lessons learned on the design and integration processes. 941588. Attached pressurized module (APM) outfitting com- plements to fit the crew and their needs. Simona Ferraris and Giorgio Musso, EUROCOLOMBUS; and Muriel Didier, ESA ESTEC. APM outfitting complements can be defined as the equipment needed daily, for the crew to perform nominal tasks, this equipment not being part of the structure. As such, their utilization is the major guideline for the design and they must be considered at system level in order to evaluate all aspects of the situation. For example, the APM configuration will change from launch to completion. What are the consequences for the utilization and design of APM outfitting complements? In order to help the design of APM outfitting complements and to get a better understanding of their utilization for nominal opera- tions, many of them have been tested in Europe in Parabolic Flights or in Neutral Buoyancy Tests. Among others, crew restraints (banis- ter, foot restraints), equipment restraints (tether, velcro, tool box..), seat-track as common interface, and the concept of removable equipment have been tested and indeed interesting and surprising conclusions have been drawn. This paper will show how a clear identification of the crew needs completed by some testing can drastically modify the original assumptions and in many cases lighten the design. 941589. Crew interface analysis for the Mini Pressurized Logistics Module - An interaction between computer simula- tion, task analysis and mock-up test evaluation. David Antonelli, Fabiana Bobba, Pier Luigi Giorgi, Vincenzo Guarnieri, and Anelia Montinaro, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. A Human Factors Engineering (HFE) analysis has been involved in the design process of the Mini Pressurized Logistics Module (MPLM) for the International Space Station (ISS) since the begin- ning, as an integrated part of the design support activities. The sup- port of HFE in the configuration process has been directed towards the optimization of the MPLM design through the analysis and eval- uation of all the interfaces occurring in the module - nominal and non-nominal - between the crew, the system and the subsystem equipment. In order to identify and analyze all the crew interfaces occurring inside the module, a systematic approach, involving different disci- plines, is necessary. The integration of three different tools such as computer simulation, task analysis and mock-up test activities has been employed as an organic unit, in order to establish a comprehen- sive collection of useful data. The following paper shows, behind the results, how such activi- ties require synergetic disciplinary approaches as a developmental tool to achieve meaningful results in human factors engineering evaluation. The analysis described in this paper has been performed having as reference the MPLM two bays configuration baselined before the Space Station redesign activity. 941591. Design and test of a fire detection system for a micro- gravity environment. Stephen R. Gustavino, Ed Garner, and Keith R. Olson, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. Fire detection in a microgravity environment produces a number of concerns. On Earth, smoke particles generated by a fire are often used to trigger an alarm signal. In space, without the thermal buoy- ancy effects produced by gravity, smoke particle movement is more random, making its detection more difficult. This problem presents itself to the module outfitters who are designing a fire detection sys- tem for the Space Station. The volumes behind the racks, referred to as exo-rack areas, are particularly difficult to monitor because they are hidden from view by closeout panels. Still, the exo- rack areas must be monitored because they contain wiring and electrical equipment that presents a potential fire hazard. A strategy for detect- ing fires in the Space Station exo-rack area has been developed by the McDonnell Douglas Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) team. The system uses piccolo tubes to collect samples of air from the exo-rack areas in the node. The sampled air is drawn past a smoke detector, which uses scattered laser light to detect smoke particles. A prototype of this system was installed in a mockup of the Space Station node for development testing. Smoke samples were passed into various compartments within the node exo-rack and the response time and detector signal strength were measured. Although the test was subject to the effects of gravity, unique test techniques allowed valuable information on the perfor- mance of the system to be gathered and inherent limitations to be identified. This paper discusses the planning, procedure, and results of this development test. Particular attention is paid to the methodol- ogy used for acquiring repeatable data and the parameters that drive fire detection system performance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941593. Fixing a hole in a manned spacecraft Wubbo J. Ock- els, Technical University of Delft; Carolo Viberti, ESTEC, Euro- pean Space Agency; and W. D. Brouwer, Technical University of Delft. Due to the micro-meteorites and space debris, a non- neglectable probability exists of a wall perforation particularly during a long space journey or during the life of a space station. Analysis and tests have been performed at ESTEC and at the Technical University of Delft of various methods to close a hole manually; it has been shown that with certain patches of silicon rub- ber, polyethylene or flame-retardant similar polymer foams, holes can be easily and adequately sealed without imposing additional risks to the astronaut. Proper sealing maintains for several days, even with hole sizes up to 10 cm2 (this latter size being the largest ones tested, which size corresponds to a probability of less than order 10"2 for a ten years life of the 1993 Station Freedom baseline). The method works also for holes difficult to reach and for holes with large crater-like and sharp edges. Present operational practice calls for emergency evacuation pro- cedures rather than attempts to seal the hole. A certain anxiety exists for pressure leaks amongst engineers, and managers involved in space operations as well as amongst many astronauts. This anxiety can be taken away, using the proposed patch materials and using the reported tests as training and demonstration. It is felt that in many cases, a crew action to seal a hole serves crew safety better than the egress of a pressurized and in principle liveable module. Realizing the ease and effectiveness of the proposed sealing method, it is recommended to fly such patches (whose mass is less than 100 grams) on each of the future manned spaceflights. 200</page><page sequence="200">941594-941602 941594. Design, calibration and implementation of a biosy n- thetic water vapor source. A. L. Blackwell and S. Maa, NASA; and S. Agelopoulos , San Jose State Univ. In efforts to generate a modeling and simulation system for the environmental control and life support system for a small plant growth chamber, the requirement for a biosynthetic water vapor source was found. The water vapor source was designed to inject a known and controlled rate of water vapor into the laboratory ver- sion of NASA Ames Research Center's Salad Machine. The ratio- nale for a water vapor source, the design of the source device, the procedures and results of calibration and the method of integrating and utilizing the device with the Salad Machine are described. 941595.

A part of the CELSS Test Facility design effort is the Engineer- ing Development Unit (EDU), a closed crop growth system. The crop growth chamber and system hardware are contained in an enclosure that isolates them from the laboratory environment. The control system includes active differential pressure control. This paper describes a linear optimal quadratic performance index design technique that was used to synthesize a state feedback controller. Performance results of the closed loop linear system as predicted by simulation is presented. 941597. Development of an empirically based wheat model for the Johnson Space Center's RLSS test bed. Marybeth A. Edeen, NASA; and Adam M. Miller, McDonnell Douglas Aero- space. The design and operation of hybrid physical/chemical and bio- logical life support systems for space application is a complex and difficult process. This paper describes the approach and results of an effort to characterize wheat growth, under various environmental conditions, at the Johnson Space Center's (JSC) Ambient Pressure Growth Chamber (APGC). Using a designed experiment, a test plan was developed for varying environmental parameters during a wheat growth experiment. The test plan was developed using a Central Composite approach to experimental design. As a result of the experimental runs, an empirical model of both the transpiration pro- cess and carbon dioxide assimilation for wheat growth over speci- fied ranges of environmental parameters has been developed. The environmental parameters include carbon dioxide concentration, ambient chamber temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and air veloc- ity. In addition, this model is sensitive enough to predict transpira- tion and carbon dioxide assimilation for different ages of the plant canopy. 941599. Thermal vacuum testing of the Capillary Pumped Loop Flight Experiment. Laura Ottenstein, Jentung Ku, and Dan Butler, NASA. The Capillary Pumped Loop Flight Experiment (CAPL) is a pro- totype of the Earth Observing System (EOS) instrument thermal control systems, which are based on two-phase heat transfer tech- nology. The CAPL experiment has been functionally tested in a thermal vacuum chamber at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The tests performed included start-up tests, simulated EOS instrument power profiles, low and high power profiles, a variety of uneven coldplate heating tests, subcooling requirement tests, an induced deprime test, reprimes, saturation temperature changes, and a hybrid (mechanical pump-assist) test. There were a few unex- pected evaporator deprimes, but overall the testing was successful. The results of all of the tests are discussed, with emphasis on the deprimes and suspected causes. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941600. Thermal control system of ASTER. M. Fukushima, Japan Resources Observation System Organization. This paper presents the thermal control system of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). This instrument is part of the pay load of the EOS-AMI spacecraft, which is to be launched in June 1998. ASTER consists of three radiometers, a Master Power Supply (MPS), and a Common Signal Processor (CSP). The radiometers are the Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer (VNIR), the Short Wave Infrared Radiometer (SWIR), and the Thermal Infrared Radiometer (TIR). Each of these subsystems has an independent thermal control system. SWIR and TIR use the capillary pumped heat transport sys- tem (CPHTS), which is a new technology being developed for the EOS spacecraft, and the other ASTER components use conventional radiators and heaters. The thermal control systems were analyzed using thermal net- work methods to confirm that the temperatures are within the allow- able range where electrical, mechanical, and optical performance specifications are met. The results indicate that the thermal require- ments of each of the subsystems is met by the design approach with the accommodations provided on the EOS spacecraft. Therefore, each subsystem has been approved to proceed with engineering model development. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941601. Thermal control design for the MODIS instrument. Paul E. Bortfeldt, Santa Barbara Research Center. Santa Barbara Research Center is currently under contract from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to design and build the MOD- erate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for launch in 1998 on the EOS- AM spacecraft. MODIS is a remote sensing instrument incoporating state-of-the-art multispectral imaging and calibration technology. Two cooled infrared (IR) focal planes and two room-temperature visible and near infrared focal planes are used to gather imaging data in 36 discrete spectral bands between 0.41 and 14.4 Jim. A passive radiative cooler is employed to achieve a nominal IR focal plane operating temeprature of 85K. To meet mission objectives, band-to-bánd registration of ±0.2 pixel and radiometric calibration accuracy better than 1 % within the thermal region and 5% within the reflectance region must be main- tained over a five-year instrument design life. This places significant demands on the thermal design which must provide a stable operat- ing environment with minimal temperature gradients and therm- oelastic distortion. Advanced engineering materials including beryl- lium and graphite/epoxy are used extensively in the design along with various passive thermal control techniques to optimize perfor- mance. This paper presents an overview of MODIS thermal control design features along with a summary of analytical performance predictions for the overall system and for thermally critical sub- systems such as the passive cryogenic radiative cooler. Thermal engineering challenges are discussed along with corresponding design solutions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941602. Evolution of the atmosphere maintaining environ- ment control and life support systems for United States elements of Space Station Freedom. Henry J. Kolnsberg, Boeing Co. Designs for the systems that will maintain a comfortable, con- taminant-free atmosphere on board the Space Station have evolved through an extensive program of studies, prototype development and evaluation testing to the system baselined at the Space Station Freedom Critical Design Review. This paper documents the systems' evolution from the selection of concepts for evaluation in the initial study phase of the Space Sta- tion Program through the studies and testing that established base- line technologies to the preliminary design and development testing that provided data to enable the detailed flight designs presented and baselined at the Critical Design Review. The systems addressed include Temperature and Humidity Con- trol, which maintains comfortable temperatures in the elements, pro- vides ventilation, and removes excess humidity; Atmosphere Con- 201</page><page sequence="201">941602-941610 troi and Supply, which maintains the atmosphere's total pressure and oxygen partial pressure; and Atmosphere Revitalization, which removes carbon dioxide and trace contaminants and monitors the concentrations of the major constituents of the atmosphere. 941604. Effects of depressurization of space modules on con- densing heat exchangers. Terry L. Plunkett, Boeing Co.; and Timo- thy D. Scull , Hamilton Standard. The ability of a cabin air condensing heat exchanger to survive the depressurization of a space module is limited. The phenomenon that limits a heat exchanger's survivability is freezing caused by the cooling effect of the condensate evaporating on the air side of the condesning heat exchanger and freezing the coolant water. There are several options for solving the problem. These options include: iso- late the air side of the heat exchanger; design the heat exchanger to meet the demands of freezing; increase the coolant temperature and/or the coolant flow rate; and control the rate of depressurization. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941606. Post-fire cleanup on the space station. Rogard Ross, Engineering and Science Services, Inc.; Teresa A. J. Williams, NASA ; and Donald Sargent, Grumman Technical Services Division. This paper addresses a 1993 study by the Space Station Freedom program examining the options for post-fire cleanup on-board the Station. The study established a model for the contamination from fires and the probable distribution of the contaminants within the module. This analysis was the basis for evaluating the options avail- able for restoring the module after the event. The study examined the baselined crew protection gear and surface cleanup equipment and identifies inadequacies and recommends areas needing improvement. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941607. CFD modeling on fire detection and suppression in a Columbus rack. Ruggero Veneri and Paola Parodi, Alenia Spazio S. p. A.; and David Glynn and Kate Taylor, Flow solve Con- sultant. The Columbus fire suppression procedure is based on a central- ized CO2 distribution system which injects the CO2 stored in a tank into the volume where the fire has to be extinguished. The fire is detected in each volume by means of the so-called REP (Rack Essential Package), which contains a fan and the smoke sensor. In order to assess the Fire Detection and Suppression design concept and to identify possible critical areas, Alenia Spazio - with the sup- port of Flowsolve UK, and on behalf of EUROCOLUMBUS - has performed an analysis using a Computational Fluido-Dynamic (CFD) tool. The rack containing the water pump assembly and other electronic equipment has been chosen for the study. As far as the Fire Detection is concerned, the simulation intends to predict the flow field established in the rack by the ventilation system and the transport of smoke by this velocity field from a sup- posed point source. The smoke from any fire within the rack must be transported to the senor so the fire can be detected within a "rea- sonable" time. The Fire Suppression System has more stringent targets to meet: the CO2 must reach a 50% concentration by volume everywhere in the rack within 60 seconds. The aim of the CFD simulation was to study various combinations of CO2 nozzle and pressure relief vent positions and numbers so that the configurations which fulfill the 50% requirement can be determined. The simulation has been per- formed using the 1.6.5 version of the PHOENICS general-purpose CFD code. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941608. Catalytic oxidation of the submarine atmosphere. Thomas J. Daley, Stanley A. Jastrzębski, and Alan D. McCarrick, Naval Surface Warfare Center; and Joel L. Krinsky, Naval Sea Sys- tems Command. Replacing ozone depleting refrigerants on U.S. Navy submarines has created new design challenges as they interface with the atmo- sphere control machinery. The environmentally friendly nature of new HFC's and HCFC's is in part due to their higher reactivity. Unfortunately that reactivity causes excessive decomposition result- ing in toxic gas production when processed in the catalytic oxidizer, the U.S. Navy Submarine CO and H2 Catalytic Burner. The catalyst/ air stream is heated to induce the decomposition of H2, CO and trace organics. An effort is underway to lower the burner temperature to minimize refrigerant decomposition. This paper discusses test results of varying catalyst temperatures when trace contaminants, representative of the submarine atmosphere, are oxidized on the burner's catalyst. The effects of water vapor and catalyst age on oxi- dation efficiencies are also reported. Both bench scale and full scale burner test results are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941609. The United States Antarctic Program. Carol A. Rob- erts, John T. Lynch, and Erick Chiang, National Science Founda- tion. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has responsibility for the management, funding and operation of the United States Antarc- tic Program (USAP), the U.S. national research program in Antarc- tica. The program is multifaceted, having international obligations under the Antarctic Treaty, providing grantees funding for Antarctic scientific research, and providing the necessary operational and logistical support to researchers to execute their programs. The later includes building, maintaining, and operating all research stations, camps, and other facilities, and operating two research vessels, ski- equipped C-130 airplanes, and helicopters. The paper will examine some of USAP' s logistical and opera- tional challenges. For example, for 4 of the last 5 seasons the Pro- gram has used U.S. Air Force C-5B airplanes to deliver cargo such as helicopters and Twin Otter airplanes to McMurdo Station sea-ice runway at the beginning the season. USAP has no concrete runway in Antarctica. Before "main body" deployment every October in preparation for Austral summer activities at McMurdo and South Pole Stations, a hard-surface runway is built on the sea ice in McMurdo Sound. This enables wheeled airplanes to operate until early December when the ice runway must be abandoned. During the 1993-94 Antarctic season (October, 1993 through February, 1994), the sea ice was too thin and too warm a temperature to chance using a C-5, so all materials had to be brought to McMurdo Stations using smaller C-141 airplanes. Impacts on the program will be dis- cussed. Also in the 1993-94 season, several challenging science projects were conducted. Astronomy and astrophysics efforts among these included projects under CARA, Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica, and AMANDA, Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detec- tor Array. These two examples are in the initial stages of their work, and will continue for some time. The paper describes CARA and AMANDA, and the logistics and operational support that is required to sustain them. AMANDA, for example, is a unique neutrino tele- scope that is using the polar ice sheet itself as a detector for neutri- nos that have passed through the earth. Strings of photomultiplier tubes are frozen into one km deep holes melted into the ice to form an array that will be the basis of the telescope. Long-duration bal- looning experiments, where large balloons circumnavigate the Ant- arctic continent for up to two weeks at a time, will also be discussed. In some cases, these give astrophysical data comparable to data obtained from Space Shuttle flights. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941610. Development of an advanced life support testbed at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station. M. T. Flynn, NASA; C. Straight, Bionetics Corp.; and D. Bubenheim, NASA. This paper presents a description of the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) Antarctic Analog Project (CAAP) and its functionality as a pilot study for the design of a future Lunar- Mars habitat. A description of the prototype development testbed, 202</page><page sequence="202">941610-941617 located at Ames Research, is provided as well as an analysis of the key design parameters. The CAAP program is tasked with the development of a life sup- port testbed at the South Pole. This facility will include food produc- tion, waste processing, and in situ energy production capabilities. The testbed will provide NASA with a remote facility located in an extremely harsh environment which has been designed to provide a useful analog to the deployment of a future Lunar-Martian habitat. NASA's program goals are the operational testing of life support technologies and the conduct of scientific studies to facilitate future technology selection and system design. The NSF goals are that the development of food production, water purification, waste treat- ment, and in situ energy production capabilities will improve the quality of life for the South Pole inhabitants, reduce logistics depen- dence, and minimize environmental impacts associated with human presence on the polar plateau. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941611. Man-made closed ecosystems - Instruments for future space exploration by man. J. I. Gitelson, Russian Academy of Sciences. Artificial, closed ecosystems are potentially useful tools with which to explore ecosystem interactions, allowing investigations of the biology, physiology and biophysics of complex communities. They can also be used to evaluate the long-term effects of environ- mental constituents that are usually present at very low concentra- tions. The introduction of humans into such systems extends their usefulness even further, allowing the study of the influence of the environment on people, and the effects of people on the environ- ment. Because of the great potential of such systems in adding to human knowledge, and their considerable expense, it is appropriate that such activities be international studies. The Institute of Bio- physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Siberian Branch) has established, The International Research Center for Closed Eco- systems (Biospherics). It is located in Central Siberia near Krasno- yarsk on the Yenissei river, and is open to all interested investiga- tors. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941613. The use of passive radiation dosimeters in monitor- ing the space radiation environment Robert G. Richmond, Lock- heed Engineering &amp; Sciences Co.; and Alva C. Hardy, NASA. Passive dosimeters have been extensively used to measure space radiation exposures to crewmembers for over three decades. Although a significant evolution in materials, processes, readout, and analysis techniques for these sensors has been witnessed during this period, these simple devices remain the backbone of the current operational dosimetry program of the Space Shuttle. Indeed, the uti- lization of passive dosimeters is also planned for the space station as well as advanced manned exploration programs, i.e., Lunar Base and Mars missions. Sensor materials and types have included ther- moluminescent dosimeters, radiation-sensitive films and emulsions, and plastic nuclear track detectors. Early, transitional, and current passive dosimeter materials, systems and techniques to measure space radiation are described and discussed, with major emphasis on the development of thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) tech- niques. Results of thermoluminescent passive dosimeter measure- ment on the Space Shuttle to date are presented and discussed. Applications of passive dosimeter data to modify existing space radiation environmental and shielding models are examined. Accu- racy and precision of passive techniques for environmental monitor- ing are developed and discussed. Finally, specific recommendations for future research with passive radiation dosimeters are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941614. The space radiation environment and its measurement - From the Mercury spacecraft to the Mars mis- sion. Robert G. Richmond, Lockheed Engineering &amp; Sciences Co. From the earliest uses of active and passive radiation instrumen- tation on the Mercury-Atlas missions (MA-8 and MA-9) to our cur- rent planning for the space station and exploration missions, space radiation measurement systems have undergone a myriad of signifi- cant changes. Systems to measure the radiation environment for the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and Shuttle are described and dis- cussed. Measurements from instrumentation used on these programs have shown that the space radition environment, both in low-Earth orbit and in free space, is both temporally and spatially dynamic - resulting in changes in analytical models, measurement philosophies and systems, and mission planning activities. Three decades of experiences in the prediction and measurement of space radiation on manned spacecraft are examined, with emphasis on current and future radiation measurement systems, radiation environment pre- dictive capabilities, and exposure standards and uncertainties. Expected radiation environments of a lunar base and a typical Mars mission are discussed, as are descriptions of the radiation environ- mental monitoring systems that are proposed to support those mis- sions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941615. Radiation health in space. Donald E. Robbins, NASA. Radiation risk assessments based on exposures to the anticipated space ionizing radiation environment for a 180-day space station mission, 45-day and 90-day lunar missions, and 320- day and 600- day Mars missions are presented and discussed. Although lunar and Mars missions are also exposed to sporadic increases in the radiation environment from solar particle events, only risks for galactic cos- mic rays (GSR) are considered here. In addition to the GCR environ- ment, the space station will be exposed to trapped-belt radiation. Radiation-induced cancer mortality is taken as the end-point of con- cern. Risks are presented as functions of age and sex of the potential mission participants. Risks arising from exposure to GCR are less than 1 -percent for the space station, and lunar missions. To reduce the risk below 3-percent for a 320-day Mars mission, it will be nec- essary to select crew members of either sex that are at least 35-years of age. For a 600-day Mars mission, risks are greater than 3-percent for women of all ages. To reduce the risk to 3- percent for male crew members on a 600-day Mars mission, it will be necessary to select males of at least 45-years of age. Uncertainty of exposure estimates are discussed. Recommendations for future research are presented, including data on biological effects of heavy ions (especially as it applies to cancer mortality), and the investigation of other potential end-points such as effects of GCR heavy ions on the central nervous system. NASA's commitment to the reduction of risks is presented and discussed. Additional research needs to be conducted on the protection of astronauts from solar particle events. 941616. Radiation degradation behavior of glasses and poly- mers in simulated space environment. Wolfgang Keil and Rein- hold Bisanz, Do mie r GmbH. The simulated effects of space environment, in particular space radiation, on materials of spacecrafts are evaluated and discussed. Methods and tools used for evaluating this environment and its effects are described. Computer- based methods have been adopted, developed and applied to a selection of relevant problems occurring in scientific and extraterrestrial space projects. The test method that involves test planning, test and evaluation is described in principle. Special information on radiation induced outgassing is given for fluoropolymers. 941617. Recent neutron measurements in spacecraft. James E. Keith and Guatam D. Badhwar, NASA. Among the many radiation hazards of manned spaceflight is the potential exposure of crew members to neutrons. These neutrons are produced from several sources: from the terrestrial albedo and as secondary particles produced by the interaction of cosmic rays, solar protons and trapped protons with the material of the spacecraft. Recently, neutrons have also been observed originating in solar 203</page><page sequence="203">941617-941651 flares, at the solar surface. Theoretical estimates and experimental measurements of the neutron fluxes inside manned spacecraft in near-Earth orbit are reviewed and discussed. The anticipated neu- tron fluxes and their resulting dose-equivalents, as a function of shielding depth for exploration class missions, are presented and discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941619. An overview of spacecraft cryocooler development in the USA. Otto C. Ledord , Jr., Consultant. The requirement for a reliable long-life refrigerator to cool spacecraft payloads to cryogenic temperatures dates to the very beginning of the era of space flight. The development of spacecraft cryocooler technology has been funded on a more or less continuous basis for over 30 years. A number of cryocoolers have flown on spacecraft during this period. However, this technology has been slow to achieve full maturity and operational status for spacecraft use. This paper describes the efforts to advance spacecraft cryogenic refrigerators beyond the technology development demonstration level. The early hardware programs and flight experiments are described. The evolution of both system level payload requirements and technology bases is discussed. Current US efforts are described and some prediction of future trends attempted. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941620. Qualification of a 4K mechanical cooler for space applications. B. G. Jones, British Aerospace Space Systems, Ltd.; and D. W. Ramsay, Cyro-Cooler Group. British Aerospace Space Systems (BAe) have been awarded a contract by the European Space Agency (ESA) to industrialize the long life 4K mechanical cooler previously developed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). The requirement included a detailed review of design, manufacture of an EM cooler, followed by a char- acterization and environmental test program to pre-flight qualifica- tion levels. The cooler consists of a two-stage Stirling Cycle precooler, and a closed cycle Joule Thomson stage for achievement of 4K. This paper describes the design and discusses the industrialization activi- ties and the proposed test program. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941621. Periodic 10 K metal hydride sorptin cryocooler sys- tem. Hal J. Strumpf, Calvin W. Browning, and Kevin P. Barr, AlliedSignal Aerospace Systems &amp; Equipment. A program is being performed to design, fabricate, and test a metal hydride sorption cryocooler system capable of supplying peri- odic refrigeration at 10 K. The system is intended to cool a focal plane array for a low-earth orbit satellite. The refrigeration is effected by sublimating solid hydrogen at 10 K. The solid hydrogen is produced in a batch process by cooling, solidifying, and subcool- ing liquid hydrogen formed at 30 K by a Joule-Thomson expansion. The spent hydrogen from the sublimation and Joule-Thomson expansion is absorbed by two metal hydride sorption bed assem- blies. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941622. Miniature long-life space-qualified pulse tube cryo- cooler. E. Tward, C. K. Chan, J. Raab, and R. Orsini, TRW. In this paper we report on a reliable, small, efficient, low power, vibrationally balanced pulse tube cooler designed specifically for use on small satellites. The pulse tube cooler reliability derives from the absence of cold moving parts. The vibrationally balanced, miniature, integral pulse tube cooler, intended for a 10-year long-life space application, incorporates a non-wearing flexure bearing compressor vibrationally balanced by a motor-controlled balancer and a completely passive pulse tube cold head. Cooler weight is 2.0 kg. The maximum cooling power measured at 80 K is 800 mW for an input power to the compressor of 30 watts. The cooler is suitable for cooling sensors and optics between 60 K and 200 K, with powers up to 3.5 watts at 200 K. Self- induced vibration measurements indicate that the cooler can be bal- anced to reduce vibration forces below 0.02 newtons (N) from 0 to 1000 Hz. The first flight is scheduled for 1996. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941623. Miniature long-life space-qualified Stirling cryo- cooler. E. Tward, J. Raab, R. Orsini, and C. Jaco, TRW; and G. Davey, University of Oxford. Cryogenic coolers for small satellites require low power and minimum weight. The need for exceptional reliability in a space cooler is even more critical on small satellites since cooler redun- dancy is often not an option due to weight constraints. In this paper we report on a reliable, small, efficient, low-power, vibrationally balanced cooler designed specifically for use on small satellites. TRW has designed, built, and tested a miniature integral Stirling cooler for long-life space application. This efficient low-vibration cooler weighs 1 .4 kg and was developed for cooling infrared sensors to temperatures as low as 50 K on lightsats. The vibrationally balanced non-wearing design Stirling cooler incorporates clearance seals maintained by flexure springs for both the compressor and the driven displacer. The design achieved its performance goal of 0.25 watt at 65 K for an input power to the com- pressor of 12 watts. The cooler recently passed launch vibration tests prior to its entry into an extended life-test and its first scheduled flight in 1995. 941624. Cryogenic cooling of the F.I.R.S.T. payload. S. R. Scull, British Aerospace Space Systems, Ltd.; and M. Batchelor, Dornier GmbH. The European Space Agency Far Infra-Red and Sub-millimeter Space Telescope (FIRST) is one of the four designated "Cornerstone" missions in the long term science plan "Horizon 2000." FIRST is intended to open up the last major part of the elec- tromagnetic spectrum, the sub-millimeter and far infra-red range, which is still mainly inaccessible to observational astronomers. In 1992 an industrial consortium led by Dornier was tasked with developing a spacecraft concept for a payload comprising one Far Infra-Red (FIR) direct detection instrument and one Multi- Fre- quency Heterodyne (MFH) instrument. In order to minimize the launch mass, a mechanically cooled concept was proposed in which the payload is cooled to 4K using the range of mechanical coolers originally developed by the Ruther- ford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) and industrialized by jointly funded ESA/BAe contracts. Cooling below 4K (down to 0.1 5K) required for the FIR instrument detectors is provided as part of the instrument by a Benoit Helium Dilution Refrigerator. This paper describes the concept development of the FIRST Cryogenic Cooling Sub-system and addresses the problems associ- ated with the integration of such a complex cooling system and the proposed solutions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941650. Rethinking multiplex. Nigel Allison, Motorola Inc. Close partnerships, market forces, new integration technologies and novel software techniques are combining to reshape multiplex systems. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941651. Harris' building block approach to J1850. Dan Moore and Joel Oberman, Harris Semiconductor. The J 1850 Automotive Multiplexing System is opening up new opportunities for automotive designers. Multiplexing not only reduces wiring, weight and cost; but is also adding features by shar- ing information among modules. For example a door module could communicate that the car is being unlocked and who is unlocking it. The body controller can use this information and tell smart seats and mirrors to adjust themselves to that driver's preferences; tell the radio to turn to a particular station and start the engine. The number of modules that are being multiplexed are increasing in both number 204</page><page sequence="204">941651-941662 and function. Everything from sophisticated engine controllers to simple actuator/sensor nodes are being multiplexed. The challenge with Multiplexing a large number of modules is how to make an integrated circuit that fits all their diverse needs. A complex module, like an engine controller, requires the integrated circuit to be sophisticated enough to handle all the message buffer- ing and filtering functions. Whereas a very cost sensitive, low end module does not require the same performance. How does an IC meet the conflicting needs of an increasing number of modules? Harris Semiconductor found an answer by taking a building block approach. Harris implemented the J 1850 analog and digital functions into separate integrated circuits. Doing this not only devel- oped a flexible solution but one optimized to a degree not possible using a single integrated circuit. This article will explain how the three Harris J1850 integrated circuits (HIP7010, HIP7020 and the HIP7030) make up a flexible and cost effective solution for the J 1850 Variable Pulse Width Modulation (VPW) Standard. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941652. Effects of capacitive bus loading on J1850 vehicle networks. Enrique J. Alfaro , General Motors. Capacitive overloading of SAE J 1850 vehicle communications networks will cause a change in the time constant for a particular network causing it to fall out of specification. Addition of transient voltage protection devices to communications nodes increases a node's capacitive load on a system causing the overall network time constant to change. Other capacitive components commonly encountered in a communications network will also change the net- work's time constant, causing it to fail or to behave erratically. Component selection plays an important role in maintaining the cor- rect capacitive loading on a SAE J 1 850 network in order to adhere to the physical layer characteristics of both PWM and VPW proto- cols. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941655. Tradeoffs between stand-alone and integrated CAN peripherals. Craig Szydłowski , Intel Corp. The CAN Protocol is currently implemented as on-chip peripher- als integrated on microcontrollers and as stand-alone CAN chips. On-chip peripherals are available on several microcontroller archi- tectures, including the MCS® 51 and the MCS® 96 microcontroller families. Likewise, there exists a variety of production-level stand- alone CAN chips such as the Philips PCA82C200 and the Intel 82527. The decision to use an integrated CAN peripheral or a stand- alone CAN chip should consider the tradeoffs between both alterna- tives. These tradeoffs include implementation cost, design flexibil- ity, level of CPU burden and system reliability. This paper discusses these tradeoffs from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The goal of this paper is to identify the key issues that differentiate these two alternatives for various design and production goals. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941656. Physical media issues for high speed vehicle net- works. James Cirillo, Kurt Jennings, Mark Lynn, and Robert Steele, General Motors Corp. The evolution of vehicle electronics has resulted in correspond- ing changes in how vehicle communications networks are being used. Initially used for diagnostic and low speed data sharing appli- cations, networks are increasingly being used for real time control applications that require significantly higher data rates. While high speed networking technology has been primarily developed for office LAN and telecommunications applications, the requirements of in-vehicle communication networks differ significantly from their office and factory counterparts. This paper will examine the issues involved in choosing a physical layer for a vehicle network including: media bandwidth, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements, fault tolerance, serviceability requirements, ability to meet vehicle environmental requirements, network architecture lim- itations, and cost. This paper will also show that for application data rates above 250Kbps, plastic optical fiber (POF) is the lowest cost, highest performance network medium. It will also show that, unshielded twisted pair wiring (UTP) provides the best solution for data rates under 125KBps. For date rates between 125Kbps and 250Kbps, the optimal medium is application dependent. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941658. Robust adaptive data-compression for peak-load reduction in low-speed automotive multiplex systems. Gero G. Kempf and Karl Strenzl, BMW AG. The improvement of low-speed MUX-systems in car-body areas gets important in a scenario where on one hand, the possible number of integrated local control units (LCU's) gets larger and on the other hand, the possible versions of a car range from basic to top-of-the- line. Cost and development time can be reduced if the same MUX- System is used throughout this whole range. A possibility to realize this is the use of data-compression (DC) for data-transmission. Basic configurations integrating only a small number of LCU's of a car-MUX can communicate without using data-compression, whereas for the top-of-the-line versions, the performance can be enhanced using DC only for communication processes between additional control units causing critical peak load situations. Specifically, the use of adaptive algorithms in automotive multi- plex systems is a promising way to improve the MUX's capacity performance by minimizing redundant symbols/information in peak-load situations. The main problem in realizing adaptive com- pression is to get enough robustness in synchronizing the adaption of the compression base in both sender/encoder and receiver/ decoder. Desynchronization appears mainly as a consequence of unrecognized transmission errors. The algorithm is realized on a rapid prototyping platform on a 68000 computer using a standard LCU task handling operating sys- tem. This platform allows fast program development as well as the real-time evaluation of different parametrizations of DC-algorithms and the integration into a simultaneous engineering process. First results from laboratory- vehicle tests with a prototype of a traffic management control system on this platform are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941660.

The structure of network conversation is an important adjunct to the process of in-vehicle data transfer. Beyond the physical layer, data link, address, and message struc- tures, the utilization of network conversation is one of the system integrator's key tools in implementing network-based products. To use networks for both open-loop and closed-loop distributed functions, many system designers are implementing in software some of the elements of the OSI Session Layer. This paper examines the characteristics and timing aspects of network dialogue and their strong relationship with the performance of distributed operating systems. 941661.

Prediction of structure-borne noise inside tractor cab. Wen L. Li and Kai Zhao , Case Corp. Tractor cab interior noise has been predicted by using a numeri- cal method whereby cab structural and acoustic characteristics are described, respectively, by finite element and boundary element models. The spectral vibrational data measured below cab isolation mounts is used as mechanical excitations to cab-mount system. Responses on each grid point are calculated in structural analysis and subsequently converted to velocity boundary conditions in acoustic prediction of interior noise. The analytical results match reasonable well with the measured regarding cab vibration and the noise level at operator ear. Panel contribution analysis is also per- formed to examine the relative importance of concerned portions of cab structure or enclosure. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941672. Feature extraction from non-linear geometric mod- els in design-for-manufacturing. Ratnaker Sonthi, Kambainathan R. Harinarayan, and Rajit Gadh , University of Wisconsin-Madison. Automatic manufacturability analysis of injection moldings, sheet metal castings, stampings, forgings, etc., using knowledge- based heuristics depends on shape features, which are abstractions of the three dimensional (3D) geometric model of the parts. Conven- tional CAD systems do not explicitly contain shape feature informa- tion, therefore such information needs to be extracted from them. So far, extraction of shape features has been restricted to models with simple geometric shapes such as planar, cylindrical or conical shapes. Extending shape feature extraction to non-linear geometric models will allow Design For Manufacturability (DFM) analysis of non-linear models. This paper presents an approach to extract fea- tures from non-linear geometric models. The approach is based on abstract geometric entities called C-loops. The formation of a C-loop depends on a geometric entity called a silhouette. The C-loops are derived from the silhouette boundaries of an object. This paper presents an algorithm to detect silhouettes on non- linear surfaces and describes how the detected silhouettes can be used for feature extraction. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941674. Conceptual design optimization of cab HVAC sys- tem. Kasi Sethupathi and Gopi Somayajula, Case Corp. The application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to exter- nal and internal flows in automotive industry has grown tremen- dously when compared to the off-highway industry in the last decade. The purpose of this article is to share recent developments on the applications of CFD in off-highway industry, specially at Case. A thorough 3D CFD analysis was done for the cab A-post lou- ver designs and a conceptual design optimization was done to improve the operator comfort in the cab. 941675. Computer-aided methods for design evaluation of track systems. J. Y. Wong , Carleton Univ.; Vehicle Systems Devel- opment Corp. A series of computer simulation models for performance and design evaluation of tracked vehicles have emerged in the past decade. In contrast with empirical models developed earlier, they are based on detailed studied of the mechanics of vehicle-terrain interaction, and take into account all major vehicle design features and terrain characteristics. Thus, they provide a comprehensive and realistic tool for the vehicle engineer to optimize vehicle design and for the procurement manager to evaluate competing vehicle candi- dates. These models have been gaining increasingly wide accep- tance in industry and governmental agencies. For instance, the model NTVPM for tracked vehicles with relatively short track pitch has been successfully used to assist vehicle manufacturers in the development of a new generation of high- mobility military vehicles and governmental agencies in the evaluation of vehicle candidates in Europe, North America and Asia. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941676. Design criteria development using expert systems. Biao Fu, James E. Schlegel, and Gopi Somayajula, Case Technical Development Center. The paper describes a project being conducted at Case where an expert system is being used to document and develop design criteria. The objective of this project is to capture and retain design criteria knowledge, document and retrieve knowledge on-line, and predict and evaluate design criteria for new machines or new market requirements. An expert system development tool, ADS (Aion Development System), is used in this project. A system security mechanism and many graphical user interface features are imple- mented using object-oriented programming techniques. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, a questionnaire is also developed. The acquired knowledge has been used in several product design pro- grams at Case. 941677. Development of a PC-based software for analysis of off-road vehicle seat suspension. R. Ranganathan and K. Sriram, University of Missouri-Columbia. Dynamic analysis of vertical seat suspensions of off-road vehi- cles is performed via computer simulation models in order to estab- lish their ride performance. The PC-based computer simulation pro- gram is capable of analyzing various commercially available seat suspensions under different input excitations. The software is devel- oped using the Visual Basic interface on Microsoft Windows plat- form and is entirely menu driven. The software is organized in a sys- tematic fashion with the pre-processor, analysis and post- process- ing modules and has the option to choose any module from the ini- tial selection screen. A database of various seat-suspension characteristics, along with other off-road vehicle input parameters is available in the pre-processor module. Analysis of the dynamic system is performed using a generalized two-degree of freedom model characterizing the vertical seat and suspension motion. The model incorporates the system nonlinearities due to shock absorber damping, coulomb friction and bump stops. The nonlinearities in the model are linearized using a local equivalent linearization technique based on energy similarity in order to compute the ride performance of the seat-suspension system. The base excitations from the cab floor on the seat-suspension system include both deterministic (sinusoidal and shock) and random input conditions. The post- processing module graphically presents the vibration attenuation characteristics of the seat-suspension in terms of the following per- formance criteria: (a) acceleration transmissibility and (b) Power Spectral Density (PSD) of acceleration response for the random input. 941678. (SP- 1049) Delayed charging: A means to improve two-stroke engine characteristics. Pierre H.Ch. Rochelle, Univer- sity of Paris. We have developed and patented a new simple device which reduces the amount of short-circuited fresh charge in two-stroke cycle engines and produces stratified charging and - combustion. The principle consists in scavenging the burnt gases with fresh air and delaying the introduction of the fresh change in the cylinder. A numerical simulation showed a good promise of consumption and pollution improvement for this consumption and pollution improve- ment for this configuration. Then, preliminary bench tests have been carried out with a 50 cc production engine and the same modified engine including a delay-circuit. Due to delayed charging: - brake specific fuel consumption shows a mean 20% reduction down to a maximum of 25% compar- ing to production engine figures, - unburnt hydrocarbons show a mean 35% reduction down to more than 50%, - carbon-monoxide production decreases to a mean 1 % concentration, - torque increases 206</page><page sequence="206">941678-941685 at low r.p.m., but lowers at higher speeds of revolution due to the diminished permeability of this first prototype engine. 941679. (SP- 1049) An extended jante test procedure for two- stroke piston-ported engine development. Dennis W. Montville and Badih A. Jawad, . Two-stroke engine development has been occurring for many years. One of the main criteria affecting two-stroke piston-ported engine performance is scavenging, which is the process of using the incoming fresh air charge to purge the cylinder of exhaust gases. Among the simplest test procedures employed to model scavenging air flow is the 4 Tante" test, developed by Alfred Jante. This test was developed primarily to develop port designs for engines operating at peak power and so gives results having limited use for engines operating over a wide range. By altering the operating procedure as discussed in this paper, the Jante test can be used to provide useful information about the engine's scavenging characteristics over a wider range of engine operation. This offers a powerful tool for determining a porting design's effect on scavenging, and therefore engine performance. 941680. (SP- 1049) Quasi-dimensional modelling of combus- tion in a two-stroke cycle spark ignition engine. Michael G. Reid and Roy Douglas, Queen's University of Belfast. This paper details a theoretical and experimental study of com- bustion phenomena within a two-stroke cycle, spark ignition engine. The theoretical part of the work involved the development of an improved quasi-dimensional combustion model. This model was incorporated into a computer program which was used to predict the thermodynamic and chemical changes occurring within a two-stroke engine during the closed cycle of the engine. The simulation uses a turbulent kinetic energy model to predict flame front velocity. Combustion chamber geometry is used to estimate entrained mass and mass fraction burned is calculated from a simple eddy- entrainment approach. The experimental work was undertaken to validate the combustion model. Two separate cylinder heads were designed with different combustion chambers and tested on a stan- dard loop- scavenged engine over a range of operating conditions. This validation showed good correlation between measured and pre- dicted results, but the differences seen highlight some areas requir- ing further consideration. It is postulated that the main influencing factors are squish effects and cycle-to-cycle variation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941681. (SP- 1049) Two-stroke S.I. engine competitive to four- stroke engine in terms of the exhaust emission. Radislav Pavletic v and Ferdinand Trenc , University of Ljubljana. A model engine with disintegrated working cycle was build. Its operation is not autonomous; compression of the working air is per- formed separately outside the engine by the compressed-air line sup- ply. Pre-compressed charge together with the injected fuel is intro- duced in the combustion chamber. The model engine makes possi- ble to determine indicated performance characteristics and its emis- sion capability. Effective measured engine characteristics are of course not comparable with those obtained by an practical engine. The model presented is a two-stroke cycle engine. Exhaust emission picture of the presented engine is comparable with the emission of a modern four-stroke engine. 941682. (SP- 1049) Features of an atkinson two-stroke engine. John Brooks, Pacific Piston Ring Co., Inc.; and Alan Lane, Advanced Structures Technology, Inc. A two-stroke Atkinson cycle engine is described. The engine has uniflow stratified mixture scavenging with a variably phased spheri- cal rotary valve in the cylinder head and exhaust ports in the cylinder wall. These features combined in this configuration result in reduced fuel consumption, higher specific power output, less vibration, and smooth part load operation albeit increased size and cost compared to simple two-stroke engines used in power tools. 941683. (SP- 1049) Measurement and reduction of particles emitted from a two-stroke engine. J. Patschull and P. Roth, Ger- ha rd-Mercator- Universität- GH Duisbu rg. The present paper reports on measurements of particles emitted by a 6.3 kW, single cylinder two-stroke engine. The engine exhaust gas was diluted in a mini-dilution tunnel. Particle size classification was performed by means of a Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (DMPS) system. Measurements of the number distribution of the particle diameter and the related mass concentration were made under different engine operating conditions. It was found that the use of neither mineral nor synthetic lubrication oil had any influence on the emission characteristics of the engine. On the contrary ; a con- siderable decrease in the particle number distribution was obtained by reducing the mixing ratio of lubrication oil and fuel. Also, the impact of an electrostatic precipitator was tested behind the engine's silencer. It could be shown that a significant reduction of particle emission was obtained by removing nearly all naturally charges par- ticles from the exhaust gas. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941684. (SP- 1049) Single cycle scavenge testing a multi- cylinder, externally scavenged, two-stroke engine with a log intake manifold. Robert Fleck and David Thornhill, Queen 's Uni- versity of Belfast. The gas exchange process of the two-stroke engine is such that the flow of fresh air into the cylinder and exhaust gas out of the cyl- inder occur substantially together. It is therefore the case that not all of the air delivered will be trapped during this scavenge process. Extensive research has already been conducted into optimising the porting layouts of two-stroke engine cylinders. One of the tech- niques developed at the Queen's University of Belfast for evaluating scavenging is a unique experimental method described as the 'single cycle scavenge tesť. Although the test does not reflect the actual scavenge process in a firing engine, it is a sufficiently useful proce- dure to have become an industrial standard for scavenge evaluation. This paper discusses the application of that test procedure in the development of a multicylinder, externally scavenged, two-stroke automotive engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941685. (SP- 1049) Experimental evaluation of 1-D computer codes for the simulation of unsteady gas flow through engines - a first phase. S. J. Kirkpatrick, G. P. Blair, R. Fleck, and R. K. McMullan, Queen 's University of Belfast. This paper reports on the first phase of an experimental evalua- tion of five different methods for the mathematical modelling of unsteady gas flow in engine ducting. The five methods under inves- tigation are the homentropic method of characteristics, the non- homentropic method of characteristics, the two-step Lax- Wendroff method with flux corrected transport, the Harten-Lax-Leer upstream difference method and the Blair method of pressure wave propaga- tion through finite spaces. A single cycle pressure wave generator consisting of a cylinder, connected via a sliding valve to a long duct, has been designed and built. The pressure waves it creates closely mimic those to be found in i.e. engines. The cylinder and the ducts of the device can be filled with any gas and at elevated temperatures. A perfect seal exists between the cylinder and the valve thus enabling mass- flow correla- tion. The initial cylinder pressure may be set to simulate an induc- tion or an exhaust process. The duct attached to the pressure wave generator can simulate virtually any configuration to be found on an i.e. engine. Pressure and temperature are recorded by transducers positioned at various locations in the apparatus and stored using a high speed data acquisition system. A series of tests have been conducted to simulate exhaust and intake flow in a constant area duct sufficiently long, to permit wave observation unclouded by superposition effects and to determine the accuracy of the simulation methods and the cylinder to pipe bound- ary conditions. 207</page><page sequence="207">941685-941691 A computer simulation of the test apparatus has been written for each of the five theoretical methods using the Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) non-isentropic treatment of the boundary condi- tions. The accuracy of each prediction method is then correlated with the experimental results. As might be expected, most of the computer codes produce good correlation for unsteady flow in a constant area duct. However, this paper is the first in a series of papers which will report the exposition of the various computer codes to increasingly difficult pipe modelling geometry and thermo- dynamic discontinuities. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941686. Further exhaust emission control for two-stroke engines. Kazuo Sato, Masamitsu Nakano, and Harno Ukawa, Shi- baura Institute of Technology; and Hisashi Inaga, Kioritz Co. Two-stroke engines are being utilized in large numbers as small utility, lawn and garden equipment engines. The following two sub- jects were examined with regards to exhaust emission control. The first subject was to compare the theoretical values of a com- bustion model simulation with the experimentally measured values of the base line emission of two-stroke volume as follow in detail. Considering high short-circuiting and residual gas characteristics peculiar to two-stroke engines, comparison analysis between mea- sured exhaust emissions and calculated values by a thermodynamic combustion model simulation. Comparison analysis of the trapping efficiency-corrected HC, NOx, CO mass emission rates by the fuel flow and the fuel and air flow method. Analysis of influence to engine power and mass emission rates by the cylinder thermal load change with varying air-fuel ratio of the charge mixture. Thus, in small utility two-stroke engines, it was considered that, using the correction by the trapping efficiency Tļtr, the evaluations for the theoretically estimated and experimentally measured values of exhaust emissions could be done sufficiently accurately. The second subject was to examine the emission conformability to the 1995 and 1999 California Air Resources Board (CARB) exhaust emission regulations (California Regulations for 1995 and Later Utility and Lawn and Garden Equipment Engine, adopted at March 20, 1992, amended, at November 3, 1993; was used in our paper abridging as the 1995 and/or 1999 US-CARB exhaust emis- sion regulations.) in two-stroke engines with various combinations between various fuels, fuel supply systems and scavenging systems. For this subject it was determined that the emission control sys- tems based on the lean combustion can be used to meet the 1995 CARB exhaust emission regulations. However, it was also con- cluded that to meet the 1999 CARB exhaust emission regulations, various emission control systems with various combinations regard- ing such parameters as fuels, scavenging systems and exhaust sys- tems must be used. 941687. (SP- 1049) The OCP small engine fuel injection sys- tem for future two-stroke marine engines. S. Leighton, M. Cebis, M. Southern, and S. Ahern, Orbital Engine Company Pty. Ltd.; and L. Horner, Orbital Fluid Technologies. In the past years, manufacturers of recreational marine outboard engines have relied upon the high specific output, the low engine mass, the small packaging size and both the low investment and piece cost of the two stroke engine. With pending emission legisla- tion in USA and a growing customer demand for environmentally friendly products, the manufacturers are being challenged to provide the outboard for the future. With substantial capital investment in place for manufacture of a full horsepower range of two stroke out- boards, marine manufacturers are not eager to make the large invest- ments in alternative engines such as four stroke engines in order to meet emission legislation. The Orbital Combustion Process (OCP) Small Engine Fuel Injec- tion System (SEFIS), currently in the productionising phase, repre- sents a cost effective alternative allowing outboard manufacturers to retain the desirable attributes of the two stroke engine, yet achieve the emission capability and fuel economy equivalent or superior to that of a four stroke engine. The SEFIS system utilizes the base OCP technology derived from Orbital' s automotive two stroke engine programs. The func- tion of the direct injection hardware required has been simplified and designed for low cost manufacture. 941688. MTBE for improved diesel combustion and emis- sions? Shuichi Kajitani and H. Usisaki, Ibaraki Univ.; and E. Ciasen, S Campbell, and K. T. Rhee, Rutgers Univ. Reduced emissions from the spark-ignition engine, when fueled by gasoline containing small amounts of MTBE, have led us to explore similar positive results in compression-ignition (CI) engine combustion by adding this oxygenate compound to Diesel fuel. This study was performed in two separate laboratories by employing the respective experimental apparatus. When a pre-chamber type CI engine was operated by using Die- sel fuel mixed with several volume portions of MTBE, including 5, 10 and 15%, several positive results were obtained, as compared with those from the baseline neat Diesel-fueled operations: (1) The engine delivers overall comparable or better performance character- istics; (2) The brake thermal efficiency is higher at the advanced and late injection times; (3) Some considerable reduction of both soot and NOx emissions is found; (4) The ignition delay increases but the combustion duration decreases. In order to help explain the unexpected responses of CI combus- tion to the above fuel modifications, high-speed in-cylinder spectral infrared digital imaging was performed for the same fuel modifica- tion. Some plausible and consistent results are observed, which help explain the above findings. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941689.

Using a Laser Doppler Velocimetry with Burst Spectrum Ana- lyzer (LDV-BSA), droplet velocities of a diesel fuel spray under a pressure higher than 100 MPa were measured at different points within the spray profile. Results show that although the mean veloc- ity distribution at the sampling plane is rather uniform, the number- based droplet velocity distributions of two sampling points at the same plane are different. The conclusions agree with theoretical pre- dictions through maximum entropy principle qualitatively. 941690. (SP- 1050) Calculation and drawing of fuel film vaporization process. Wei Püning, Dalian Maritime Univ. A mathematical model has been used to study the vaporization process of fuel film spread out on the combustion chamber surfaces in diesel engines, which consists of a system of differential equa- tions of heating and vaporizing of the fuel film. The fuel film vapor- ization process is characterized as the coupling heat and mass trans- fer process. A corresponding calculation code is programmed using FORTRAN language. As an application example, the vaporization process of the fuel film on the combustion chamber surface in a 6E150C diesel engine is investigated quantitatively, and the effects of different parameters on the fuel film vaporization process are dis- cussed. The experimental data support the calculated results. A drawing software is completed using C language, which can be combined with the above calculation software and receive the data from the calculated results. By means of the drawing software, the figures of the fuel film vaporization process can be displayed on the screen of computers and be plotted through printers, which makes the research of the fuel film vaporization process convenient. 941691. (SP- 1050) An analysis of the added water effect on NO formation in D.I. diesel engines. Masahiro Ishida and Zhi-Li Chen, Nagasaki Univ. 208</page><page sequence="208">941691-941696 The effect of water in the suction air and in the emulsified fuel on NO formation was analyzed experimentally and theoretically from the point of view of changes in specific heat and the entrained air rate of the burned gas in the combustion chamber. The specific heat was calculated accurately through the chemical equilibrium composition analysis considering the absolute humidity of the suc- tion air, the amount of water added in the emulsified fuel as well as the residual gas fraction. In order to estimate the NO formation rate, the burned gas temperature which is dominated by the excess air ratio and the specific heat of the burned gas was calculated by using the two-zone combustion model. The effect of absolute humidity of the suction air on NO forma- tion is so large that a change in absolute humidity of 0.01 kg/kg results in about 20% reduction of NOx. This large reduction is based on only about 1% change in specific heat of the burned zone gas. With respect to the mechanism of a large NOx reduction due to the water emulsified fuel, it is found by the two-zone model analysis that the entrained air rate of the burned gas is hardly changed by the added amount of water, therefore, the increases in both specific heat and the gas weight due to the added amount of water in the burned zone result in a decrease in the burned gas temperature which reduces NOx largely, on the other hand, an increase of ignition delay due to the added water results in a small negative effect for the NOx reduction although it shows a positive effect for smoke reduction. Furthermore, it is shown that the NOx reduction due to the added water amount of 20% in the emulsified fuel is almost equal to the one due to an increase of 0.01 kg/kg in the absolute humidity of the suction air. 941692. (SP- 1050) The effect of pilot injection on combustion in a turbocharged D.I. diesel engine. Masahiro Ishida, Zhi-Li Chen , Gui-Feng Luo, and Hironobu Ueki, Nagasaki Univ. For reducing the exhaust emissions and improving the ignition characteristics, the effect of pilot injection was investigated experi- mentally in a turbocharged direct injection diesel engine. The pilot injection quantity was varied by changing the seat diameter of the Dodge plunger installed in the newly developed pilot injector while the separation period between the beginning of pilot injection and that of main injection was fixed at a short interval in the present experiment. The pilot injection effect on combustion was compared with the case of normal injection in two fuel oils with the cetane indexes of 55 and 40 respectively. The pilot injection showed some significant effects on improving the ignition characteristics and fuel consumption as follows; (1) the pilot ignition delay and the main ignition delay were about half of the ignition delay of the normal injection respectively. (2) The lower fuel consumption and NOx could be attained by the pilot injection at the retarded injection timing, especially under the lower load con- dition. (3) The trade-off relationship between the specific fuel con- sumption and NOx was significantly improved by the pilot injec- tion, and a larger improvement was obtained in the lower load and in the fuel with a worse ignitability. (4) In the present short pilot- main interval, a small amount of pilot quantity was recommended to reduce NOx and fuel consumption without deteriorating smoke density. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941693. (SP- 1050) Three-dimensional spray distributions in a direct injection diesel. Takuo Yoshizaki, Kelya Nishida, and Hiroyuki Hiroyasu, University of Hiroshima; and Kyu-Keun Song , Chonbuk National Univ. Experiments and modeling of a spray impinged onto a cavity wall of a simulated piston were performed under simulated diesel engine conditions (pressure and density) at an ambient temperature. The diesel fuel was delivered from a Bosch-type injection pump to a single-hole nozzle, the hole being drilled in the same direction as the original five-hole nozzle. The fuel was injected into a high- pres- sure bomb in which an engine combustion chamber, composed of a piston, a cylinder head and a cylinder liner, was installed. Distribu- tions of the spray impinged on the simulated combustion chamber were observed from various directions while changing some of the experimental parameters, such as combustion chamber shape, nozzle projection and top-clearance. High-speed photography was used in the constant volume bomb to examine the effect of these parameters on the spray distributions. The spray distributions obtained in the simulated combustion chamber are compared to the distributions calculated by a spray model based on a multi-package spray model. 941694. (SP- 1050) The optimum of heat release patterns in high speed D.I. diesel engine. Yiliang Huang and Limei Zhang, Shandong Polytechnic Univ.; and Weiguo Liu , Dalian University of Technology. The heat release rate patterns of fuel combustion determines the changing of pressure and temperature of gases with in cylinder, and furthermore made an important effect of the fuel economy, power- output, noise level and exhaust emission. In this paper, the authors discuss the fuel economy, power-output and combustion noise of R4102Q D.I. diesel engine. In optimum simulation concerning fuel economy and power- output, the indicative heat efficiency and mean indicative pressure were almost always taken as objective function. In consideration of the effect of gas pressure upon the friction losses of diesel engine, the effective heat efficiency and mean effective pressure were taken as objective function in this paper. By comparison with testing data, when the instantaneous friction was taken into consideration, the prediction accuracy of simulations was improved. The gas pressure vibration causes by compression and combus- tion transferred through structure parts and radiated from engine sur- face. When the transfer coefficient unchanged, by reducing the cyl- inder pressure level, the combustion noise level will be decreased. In this paper, the authors analyze the effect of heat release rate pat- terns upon the max combustion pressure, max pressure rising rate, cylinder pressure level and combustion noise level. 941695. Effective reduction of noise and vibration of internal combustion engines in marine installations. Romulus Racca and Stanley Walker, Barry Controls Inc. The use of larger and more powerful engines in marine pleasure craft coupled with lightweight boat construction is causing exces- sive noise and vibration which boat owners find objectionable. This is especially true in the case of diesel engines which are increasingly used in pleasure craft due to the lower risk of explosion associated with diesel fuel, and lower fuel consumption. The mountings presently used in marine installations are typi- cally bushings which have a uniformly high stiffness rate and do not attempt to isolate low engine speeds. The lightweight construction now employed by boat builders no longer permits this approach. Instead, mountings must be designed with the proper stiffness rates in each axis (vertical, longitudinal, lateral) to independently handle propulsion loads and still provide isolation of engine gener- ated dynamic disturbances to a level that is acceptable to the boat occupants. The isolator design must also limit engine motions to prevent propeller shaft problems. 941696. Calculation of the harmonic structure of marine pro- pellers torque and thrust. Dinu Taraza, "Politehnica" Univ.; Nicolae Buzbuchi, Merchant Marine Institute; and Jean Sever Popovici, Icepronav S.A. Among the excitation sources of vibration for the marine propel- ler shafting, the propeller itself plays a significant role. It is the main source of excitation for the axial vibrations and a major contributor among the excitation sources for torsional vibrations. Thus, the pos- sibility to predict the harmonic structure of the torque and thrust, in the design stage of the propeller system has a great importance for the designer. In this direction, the paper presents an analytical method of calculations for the propeller torque and thrust based only on the propeller series diagrams and general empirical formula for the wake and suction coefficients. 209</page><page sequence="209">941696-941703 A vortex model of the marine propeller, based on Prandtl lifting- line theory, has been developed. Considering the system of bounded and free vortices representing the propeller blade and its interaction with the incipient wake generated by hull motion, the velocity field around the blade profile is determined. Based upon a non- dimensional expression of the circulation , as a function of blade radius and angle of rotation, torque and thrust are computed and expressed as Fourier series. Parallel to the theoretic study, experimental investigations have been carried-out, both in cavitation tunnel and towing tank, showing an acceptable agreement between calculated and measured fluctua- tions of torque and thrust. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941697. Torsional vibration of drive trains. J . H. Griffin , W-T Wu, and J. A. Wickert , Carnegie Mellon Univ.; and J. B. Brown, Jr., NSWC/Carderock. This paper discusses the status of a government and industrially sponsored research and development program on drive train tor- sional vibration. Phase I of the program was completely sponsored by the U.S. Navy. During Phase I, a computer code was developed at Carnegie Mellon University for calculating the torsional response of small craft and ship drive trains. In addition, the Navy has undertaken an extensive test program to measure the torsional response of drive trains during sea trials of new and re-engined ships and craft. The resulting data base has been utilized to assess the accuracy of current torsional models and provides a basis for assess- ing possible improvements. Phase II of the program is being pursued through a government, university, and industrial consortium. The purpose of the Torsional Vibration Consortium is to help develop a more standard approach for modeling drive train vibration, assess and improve the accuracy of predictions, develop a readily accessi- ble data base of component models, maintain and improve the tor- sional computer code, and perform basic research on various aspects of drive train vibration. The improvement in prediction capability should result in improved drive train designs that experience fewer vibration related durability problems. 941698. Optimum phasing of engine and propeller in marine propulsion systems with direct-coupled two-stroke engines. Dinu Taraza, ' 'Politehnica Univ.; and Nicolae Buzbuchi, Mer- chant Marine Institute. In marine propulsion systems with direct-coupled two-stroke large diesel engines, the angular position of the propeller with respect to the crankshaft remains unchanged during the whole oper- ation of the engine. The interference between major harmonic orders of the engine torque is avoided by choosing a number of blades, different from any divisor of the cylinder number. However, interferences between other harmonic orders of the engine torque and the major harmonic order of the propeller torque -which is equal to the number of blades- may increase the amplitude of torsional vibrations. The paper shows that there is an optimum phasing between crankshaft and propeller for which a decrease, up to 20%, of the dynamic shear stress of the shafting -in comparison with the worst possible phasing-may be achieved. This results points out the impor- tance of being able to calculate, in the design stage, the best phasing of engine and propeller. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941699. Experimental performance results from a carbon dioxide/oxygen breathing diesel engine. J. G. Hawley, US Naval Academy ; and G. T. Reader, University of Calgary. Non-air-breathing diesel engine systems have, and continue to be developed for underwater applications. When the engine is operated in such an environment the intake oxidant mixture consists of a combination of oxygen and recycled exhaust gas. The latter will contain combustion gaseous products and may also include addi- tional inert diluents. Since its initial conception in the late nineteenth century, a major problem encountered in the operation of the recycle diesel engine has been the detrimental effect of the recirculated exhaust carbon dioxide upon the engine's performance. To avoid this problem exhaust gas scrubbing systems have been developed to remove the carbon dioxide from the exhaust gases. In addition, inert gases such as argon and helium have been added to the non-air mixture to improve its thermodynamic and transport properties and hence engine performance. These efforts have resulted in the evolution of increasingly complex systems and somewhat negated the attractive- ness of the conceptual simplicity of the recycle diesel. However, initial engine test results conducted as part of a collab- orative research project started in the late 1980s indicated that the pernicious effects of carbon dioxide has perhaps been overempha- sized in the extant technical literature. Thus, it was decided to ascer- tain the operating envelopes of both a DI and IDI non-air diesel engine within which acceptable performance could be obtained using purely carbon dioxide and oxygen mixtures. The rationale behind these investigations being that simpler and, therefore, more attractive underwater diesel engine systems may be possible. In this paper the main experimental results that have been obtained from tests on a multi-cylinder Di diesel engine configured to operate on oxygen and carbon dioxide atmospheres are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941701. Traction and stability tests of a highway mower. Junfan Dai, Naiqian Zhang, and S. J. Clark, Kansas State Univ. Tractive efficiency (TE) and lateral stability were tests on a DewEze MC70 highway mower with three types of tires under two different inflation pressures. A data acquisition system was devel- oped to measure 12 variables including surface slopes in the longitu- dinal and lateral directions. Results of field tests showed that one tire type outperformed the other two types and the lower inflation outperformed the higher inflation pressure in TE. The tests on side slopes showed no significant difference in lateral stability among the three types of tires or between two inflation pressures. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941702. On-line measurement of formaldehyde in tailpipe emissions by tunable diode laser spectroscopy. Wen Ma, Louis I. Leviticus, and Frank G. Ullman, University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Measurements of tailpipe emissions from a heavy duty engine operating on mixtures of diesel and Soy-Methyl-Ester (SME) fuels were performed. A standard dynamometer and bench emission ana- lyzers were used to analyze engine performance parameters and exhaust emissions. On-line measurements of formaldehyde (HCHO) in the exhaust with a tunable diode laser spectrometer (TDLS) are described. Preliminary results showed that three engine parameters (power, torque, and BSFC) were not affected by the presence of SME up to 30 percent in the mixtures. Pure diesel fuel and mixtures of diesel-SME fuels exhibit similar properties of regu- lated exhaust emissions (HC, NOx and CO). About a 10 percent increase of formaldehyde with a 10 percent increase of SME con- centration was found. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941703. Field evaluation of a combine feedrate sensor. N. D. Klassen, R. J. Wilson, J. N. Wilson, and S. N. Pang, University of Saskatchewan. This paper describes the development and preliminary field eval- uation of a combine feedrate sensor. The sensor employs electrical capacitance sensing techniques in a parallel plate configuration in which one plate is located in the table (or platform) with the other being the table auger. The sensor indicates the mass flowrate (fee- drate) of material conveyed by the auger to the feeder. For comparison purposes, the combine harvester was instru- mented for measurements of table auger torque and feeder displace- ment. Conventional bagging techniques of effluent over fixed time intervals were used to establish average feedrate. 210</page><page sequence="210">941703-941713 The results show that the capacitance sensor provides an indica- tion of feedrate and more linear performance over a wider range of feedrate than the other two sensing techniques. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941704. Concept to commercialization: A university machine design case study. M. E. Wright and S.L. Smith, Louisiana State Univ. Sweet potato harvesting requires the destruction of a massive amount of above ground vine material before digging can begin. The efficiency of harvesting is greatly increased if the potatoes are detached from their root stems before they are dug. The develop- ment of a machine in a university mechanization research program which successfully accomplished these two tasks is reported, includ- ing field testing on commercial farms and laboratory test results. Further, the development of drawings and bills of material resulting in a 4 'know-how" contract between the university and the manufac- turer, and the subsequent cooperation between these two, are described. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941705. Prospects of high-speed tillage. R. L. Kushwaha and J. Shen, University of Saskatchewan; and C. Linke, University of Hohenheim. Field tests in sandy loam and clay soils were conducted with sim- ple vertical tillage tools up to a speed of 18 ms"1 (65 km h"1) to deter- mine the influence of soil types on the high-speed performance of tillage tools and the detailed relationship between draft and speed. A non-linear, dynamic finite element method (FEM) was used to simulate the variation in tool draft with cutting speed. The prospects of high-speed tillage were discussed on the basis of these experi- mental and analytical results. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941707. Using a hose life prediction program. John D. Tow le, Purdue Univ. Recent investigations conducted by John Deere Des Moines Works (JDDMW) on the possible adverse effects of recent industry wide increases in tractor standby pressure and its effect on hydraulic hose life prompted a follow-up study at the John Deere Product Engineering Center (PEC). The JDDMW investigation extensively used the Hose Fatigue Life Program that is based on the cumulative damage theory of metals. Because no known research has been done regarding the conservativeness of this program, a series of tests con- cerning variables affecting the fatigue life of hydraulic hoses was initiated. The purpose of the study was to determine the degree of confidence in predicting the fatigue life of hydraulic hoses with known variable pressure histories. The study consisted of evaluating four variable which the program did not fully take into consider- ation. These variables were time at load, bend radius, pressure range, and pressure mean. Testing was conducted using a single manufacturers single wire 9.5mm (3.8in.) ID hydraulic hoses and all conclusions made in this report are exclusively for this manufactur- er's hose. Results from the study have shown that Hose Fatigue Life Pro- gram can be used to make accurate hose life predictions when the actual Pressure-Life curve of the hose in question is known and when the history of the hose is mostly zero-to-max pressure cycles. 941708. A distributed processor approach for marine shift/ throttle control. Mark P. Schneider and Mark S. Vemyi, Morse Controls Division. Several factors have driven the development of various elec- tronic marine shift/throttle control systems in recent years. The ben- efits of marine electronic shift/throttle systems are increased cycle life, reduced maintenance requirements, and decreased installation concerns. Design considerations include selection of a microproces- sor system, communication between nodes, operator feedback, and protocols for various mode selections. A recent development in marine electronic technology uses a dis- tributed microprocessor approach that eliminates the negative fac- tors associated with mechanical controls while actually improving operator feedback. The system's serial communication also allows for expansions into intelligent systems applications. This technology shows promise for use in industrial, automotive, and military appli- cations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941709. Electronic system integration for marine engine applications. Larry E. Mueller and Siamak Mirhakimi, Caterpillar, Inc. An open architecture of electronic controls and monitors has been conceived and developed to meet marine application require- ments and provide vessel control features. Integration of this system reduces the number of components, improves reliability, and eases installation and troubleshooting. The architecture provides the plan for system integration, while allowing flexibility for customer component selection, system tech- nology upgrades, and expansion with additional features. Serial links are used to provide the data channels within the modular style architecture and the communication ports to share information with the operators. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941710. Review of the new automation section of the ameri- can bureau of shipping's rules for building and classing steel vessels. Robert M. Conachey and Devi P. Rungta, ABS Americas. Because of the rapid progress in the electronics field during the last few years coupled with the ever increasing use of computer based systems on board ships, ABS initiated a project to completely rewrite the Automation section of the Rules for Building and Class- ing Steel Vessels which became effective in 1994. A description of the new format along with the technical basis and various interna- tional standards used in the sections' s development will be pro- vided. Some of the new or enhanced features of the revised section to be discussed are requirements for basis design of control, alarm and safety systems including independence, manual modes, redun- dancy, overrides, characteristics of visual and audible alarms, suit- ability of components, and built in testing provisions. The revised Rules now include requirements for equipment fitted with remote and automatic control systems in non-propulsion related systems and propulsion systems for which automation certification has not been requested. The requirements for computer based systems including Local Area Networks (LAN's) will also be discussed. The new minimum requirements for control and alarm systems for auto- mation certified vessels fitted with diesel- electric propulsion sys- tems will also be introduced. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941712. An experimental study on the effect of squeeze motion at the elastomeric radial lip seal interface on pumping. Jiajin Qu, CR Industries. In this work the role of the squeeze motion, which is the relative radial motion between the seal lip and the shaft, as a part of the pumping mechanisms of the elastomeric radial lip seal has been studied. Six operational factors; shaft speed, fluid temperature, dynamic runout, seal wear track width, rubber material and shaft surface roughness have been considered. The results reveal that the shaft runout and the shaft speed are the most important influential factors on the squeeze pump rate. However, the squeeze pump rate is less than 10% of the total pump rate of the seal. Therefore, the squeeze pumping is not a dominant pumping mechanism. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941713. Hydraulic power and cooling capacity available from agricultural tractors for operating hydraulic motors. Gary L. Dòstal, John Deere Product Engineering Center. 211</page><page sequence="211">941713-941723 Methods of projecting (a) tractor hydraulic power and (b) cooling capacity available from the tractor for hydraulic motor usage have been desired to define the tractor hydraulic limits. A theory was developed to define a tractor hydraulic cooling capacity limit based on a pressure compensated (closed center) hydraulic system. The conservation of energy equation was modified for application to a tractor and implement control volume. The theoretical tractor hydraulic cooling capacity limit was compared to wind tunnel cool- ing test results. A graphical format was developed to present the maximum pressure, maximum power, and cooling capacity on the same plot. 941714. Load sensing fluid power systems. Yasuo Aoki, Kazuo Uehara, Kazuyuki Hirose, Tadao Karakama, Kouichi Morita , Terno Akiyama, and Yosuke Oda , Komatsu Ltd. Closed-Center-type Load Sensing Systems for fluid power con- trols in hydraulic excavators, which had been considered as far back as 1955, were proposed in the U.S.A. in 1975, but were not feasible. In the late of 1980' s European-made hydraulic excavators were equipped with load sensing systems, including flow dividing con- trol. In the early 1990's, further improvement of CLSS's were made in Japan. CLSS's are capable of controlling complex motions of multiple actuators with high accuracy against varying loads under varying engine speed conditions, with expectations for improved controlla- bility and compatibility of hydraulic excavators to many kinds of works in which attachments are used. Conversely, operators have made the best use of the characteristics of conventional fluid power systems, in which each actuator speed is varied by inertia or engine speed change. Accordingly in 1993, Komatsu Ltd. introduced a range of new hydraulic excavators, equipped with newly-developed CLSS's, which are suitable for either traditional excavator use or new electri- cal operation, including automatic electronic control by microcom- puter. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941716. Pressure compensated pump control for forestry log skidders. Gregory R. Bouzard, Oilgear Co. Pressure compensated pump control ensures maximum pump flow until the hydraulic system reaches the control's preset pressure setting. This control then regulates the pump's output flow to match the flow requirements of the hydraulic system while maintaining a preset output pressure. This type of pump control assists in reducing hydraulic system loads on the engine and eliminates engine stall when maximum engine horsepower is required. John Deere (Industrial Div.) produces a forestry log skidder that uses this type of pump control to maximize overall machine effi- ciency. This type of pump control allows them to drive their trans- mission directly from their engine, eliminating an inefficient torque converter. This paper will describe how an Oilgear pressure compensated pump operates and interacts with each hydraulic function on a for- estry log skidder. Diagrams illustrating a pump and control will be explained in detail. Pressure-flow curves will be explained in detail to assist in describing how a pressure compensated pump is a practi- cal way to efficiently use power on a log skidder. A hydraulic circuit will also be shown to assist in the explanation of the interaction of the hydraulic pump and each function of the log skidder. This paper will conclude by explaining how a pressure compensated pump con- trol assists John Deere in eliminating an inefficient torque converter. 941719. Computer-controlled fastener manufacturing work- station. Kang B. Lee, National Institute of Standards and Technol- ogy . A flexible fastener manufacturing workstation was developed in the Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to manufac- ture precision, threaded, metal fasteners. The workstation was then transferred to the machine shop at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in New Hampshire for making fasteners for submarines. The research and development project was a joint collaboration between the NIST, the Navy, and industry partners to advance the Naval shipyard's fastener manufacturing technology. US naval shipyards manufacture threaded metal fasteners from the material K-monel and nickel-copper. These level- 1, SUBS AFE fasteners are used for critical applications in nuclear submarines. They must meet stringent MIL-S-1222H, as well as ASME/ ANSI specifications. Hence, an integrated turning/machining workstation was developed to meet the requirements of tight tolerances specified for the fasteners, material traceability, and fasteners on demand in small-lot sizes. Applying on-line gaging and closed- loop manufac- turing process control techniques, through tool wear compensation, the workstation produces quality fasteners and minimizes scraps. The workstation has also incorporated in-station lot-ID marking to enhance material traceability and an integrated database to ensure manufacturing data integrity. As a result, the workstation has shown a very significant improvement in efficiency and productivity. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941720. Revolutionizing shipboard maintenance. Rene ' M. Fry, Military Sealift Command. Since 1989, the Military Sealift Command has documented mil- lions of dollars in cost savings in an innovative lube oil management program using OEM certified lubricants, a central testing facility, and a local area network based used oil analysis database called, Graphical Lube Analysis System (GLAS). GLAS contains the entire history of lube analysis results taken from more than 8,300 pieces of shipboard equipment. Electronically updated daily from a central- ized laboratory, GLAS provides accurate and timely maintenance recommendations via satellite to approximately 90 ships operating worldwide. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941722. Development of hydromechanical transmission (HMT) for bulldozers. Hiroyuki Mitsuya, Keiji Otani, Tsutomu Ishino, Ryouichi Maruyama, and Toshiyuki Akasaka, Komatsu Ltd. Conventional medium to large-sized bulldozers have a power train comprised of a manually operated powershift transmission connected in series with a torque converter. There is a growing need, however, for a power train that is more efficient and easy to operate, thereby increasing bulldozer productivity. One answer to this growing demand is the hydromechanical transmission (HMT) developed by Komatsu for medium to large- sized bulldozers. The HMT consists of a powershift transmission combined in parallel with a hydrostatic transmission (HST) featur- ing a pair of hydraulic units. The HMT has a continuously variable shifting ratio and achieves high efficiency and automatic shifting. Additionally, it has an electronic controller that controls the trans- mission ratio to maintain engine speed at the maximum power point. As a result, bulldozers with the HMT demonstrate greatly improved productivity over bulldozers with the conventional powertrain. Fur- thermore, automatic shifting releases the operator from shifting operation, allowing the operator to concentrate on operating the work equipment and thereby reducing operator fatigue. This paper explains the method of selecting the gear train and hydraulic unit, and provided an outline of the control method. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941723. Evaluation methodology of gear systems by dynamic real time non-linear F.E.M. analysis. Akbar D. Farahani, Engi- neering Technology Associates, Inc. A new strategy for dynamic nonlinear analysis of a gear system in real time has been developed. The approach utilizes an explicit finite element analysis code such as LS/DYNA3D to analyze a gear train system. The analysis results are used to establish design vari- ables such as tooth deflection, load sharing, stress variation and material behavior. 212</page><page sequence="212">941723-941730 This approach will provide a precise analytical solution for any type of gear system. The results of this methodology enable engi- neers to obtain more accurate information (contact forces, gear stresses, load sharing, and tooth deflection) of gear behavior. The gear stress results can be animated in real time, thereby enabling the engineer to examine the actual behavior of the gear system visually. The analytical results were compared with actual experimental results from five sets of parallel helical transmission gears. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941724. Branch power zero and a new type of transmissions. Ming Yuen Law, Tai Yung Enterprise Co. Introducing a new concept BPZ (Branch Power Zero), this paper reveals a way to improve the geared torque converter and other power split transmissions by developing an external split transmis- sion system of which the two BPZ' s are unequal, non-zero, finite, and in the same drive direction. 941725. The eaton® CEMT™ (converter enhanced manual transmission). Mark A. Osiński, Eaton Corp. The Eaton® CEMT™ (Converter Enhanced manual Transmis- sion), was introduced into the agricultural market in April, 1992. Designed to the specifications of AG-Chem Equipment Co., Inc. the CEMT™ meets the unique requirements of an environment where varying field conditions, grades, heavy payloads, and frequent turn- ing, lead to high shift densities for conventional heavy-duty manual transmission. The CEMT™ combines the versatility of an 18-speed transmis- sion, with the torque multiplication characteristics of a torque con- verter under electronic management. The result is an transmission which virtually eliminates the need for shifting while working a field. 941726. Biomechanical analysis of tractor induced head injury. Liming Voo, Frank A. Pintar, Narayan Yoganandan, and Anthony Sanees, Jr., Medical College of Wisconsin, and Veterans Affairs Medical Center; Channing L. Ewing, Hoechst Celanese Corp.; Daniel J. Thomas, New Orleans, Louisiana; and Richard G. Synder, Biodynamics International. Head injury is a serious threat to lives of people working around farm machinery. The consequence of head injuries are costly, para- lytic, and often fatal. Clinical and biomechanical data on head inju- ries are reviewed and their application in the analysis of head injury risk associated with farm tractor discussed. A significant proportion of tractor-related injuries and deaths to adults, as well as children, is due directly or indirectly to head injury. An improved injury reporting program and biomechanical studies of human response to tractor rollover, run over, and falls, are needed to understand mecha- nisms of the associated head injury. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941727. Biomechanical tolerance of the cranium. Narayan Yoganandan, Anthony Sanees, Jr., Frank A. Pintar, and Patrick R. Walsh, Medical College of Wisconsin, and Veterans Affairs Medical Center; Channing L. Ewing, Hoechst Celanese Corp.; Daniel J. Thomas, New Orleans, Louisiana ; Richard G. Synder, Biodynamics International; and John Reinartz, and Karl Droese, Medical Col- lege of Wisconsin, and Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The objective of the study was to investigate the biomechanical response of the intact cranium. Unembalmed human cadavers were used in the study. The specimens were transected at the base of the skull leaving the intracranial contents intact; x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained. They were fixed in a spe- cially designed frame at the auditory meatus level and placed on the platform of an electro-hydraulic testing device via a six- axis load cell. Following radiography, quasistatic loading to failure was applied to one of the following sites: frontal, vertex, parietal, tempo- ral, or occipital, retroreflective targets were placed in two mutually orthogonal planes to record the localized temporal kinematics. Applied load and piston displacement, and the output generalized force (and moment) histories were recorded using a modular digital data acquisition system. After the test, x-ray and CT images were obtained, and defleshing was done. Biomechanical responses were nonlinear. Microfailures were identified in the force-deflection response before reaching the ultimate load carrying capacity. Dis- placed and nondisplaced fractures of the outer and inner tables occurred. Unique changes in the local kinematics confirmed the fracture pattern. Peak forces, deflections, stiffnesses and energies ranged from 3.4 to 1 1.9 kN, 6.9 to 20 mm, 467 to 1290N/mm, and 10.8 to 104.2 J, respectively. A comparison of this quasistatic data with the preliminary dynamic studies have indicated an approxi- mately two-to-one relationship between dynamic and quasistatic strength (forces) with no such tendency in the deformations. These results suggest that the cranium is a deformation sensitive structure. This is of critical importance in the design of injury mitigating sys- tems such as loading platforms, helmets, and farm machinery. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941728. Tractor induced wheel runo ver injuries. Frank A. Pintar and Narayan Yoganandan, Medical College of Wisconsin and Veterans Affairs Medical Center ; Vijay Goel, University of Iowa ; Y. King Liu, University of Northern California ; and Anthony Sanees, Jr., Medical College of Wisconsin and Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In the present investigation a tractor wheel runover accident was simulated to obtain biomechanical information relating to mecha- nism of injury. Twelve cadaver porcine specimens were runover with the right front wheel of a tractor. Specimens were placed on a six-axis force plate and thorax contours were recorded temporally. Results indicated up to 68% compression of the chest occurred dur- ing the runover event. The shear force in the direction of travel was a significant factor in the type of fractures that occurred to the rib cage. Pathology determined from x-ray revealed multiple fractures per rib in the area directly below the path of the tire. Autopsy evalu- ation revealed soft tissue contusion on the left side in the area of wheel path. There was often extra blood in the pericardial space and examination of the brain showed petechial hemorrhaging subdu- rally. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941729. Biomedical implications for farm machinery design. Mark A. Purschwitz, University of Wisconsin. Biomedical implications of farm machinery design are described. Various aspects of machine design with biomedical implications are summarized. These include access to operator platforms; seat and platform design; control placement and usage; worker tasks; noise; stability, handling, and performance characteristics; provision of safety devices; secondary systems in case of malfunction; mainte- nance and adjustment features; ease of repair and unplugging, and prevention of improper acts. 941730. Diesel engines fuel economy characteristics. A. A. Golverk, Moshe Sharet. Fuel economy of tractor diesel engines of low, moderate, and high nominal (rated) power is analyzed using the engines regulator characteristics. The method for constructing the generalized regula- tor characteristic has been developed. Analytical correlations between brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake power of the engine are obtained under restriction of fixed allowed error. Fuel economy of the engines of different nominal power is analyzed. Dimensionless regulator characteristics are used for generalization of the results of analysis. Engine performance characteristics, viz, nominal BSFC and esti- mated BSFC, have been calculated. A new general characteristic of the fuel consumption - estimated operational BSFC is introduced. It accounts for fuel consumption of the engine operating in a wide range of loads and speeds. Admissible ratios between rated, esti- mated, and estimated operational BSFC' s have been determined for diesel engines of various power. 213</page><page sequence="213">941731-941738 941731. Numerical solution and study of thermal effect of transient processes of a turbocharged diesel engine. Jie Ma and Brian Agnew, University of Newcastle. This paper reports on a theoretical investigation of the transient response of a turbocharged and intercooled diesel engine. A com- prehensive computer program has been written to simulate the per- formance characteristics of the several elements of the engine in order to study the operating characteristic of the total system. Numerical solutions of the influence of the thermal effects of some components on the transient processes of the engine have been determined. The potential of the simulation is illustrated by predic- tions of the engine transient performance in the standard build con- dition and also with changes in component design and performance. 941732. investigation of a direct injection diesel engine by high-speed spectral IR imaging and KIVA-II. Y. I. Jeong, Korea Institute of Machinery and Metals; and Y. Qian, S. Campbell, and K. T. Rhee, Rutgers Univ. In-cylinder process of a direct injection (DI) compression igni- tion (CI) engine was studied by using the Rutgers high-speed spec- tral infrared (IR) imaging system and the KIVA-II computer code. Comparison of the engine measurements with the computational prediction was attempted. In order to perform the instantaneous IR imaging, a Cummins 903 engine cylinder head was modified by installing an optical access in place of one of the intake valves, which required designing a new rocker-arm mechanism. The measurements obtained using the high/speed dual spectra IR imaging system were processed by the conventional two-color method which employed soot as the radiat- ing target. The KIVA-II program was coded in order to match engine and operation conditions to those employed in the present measurements for achieving mutual consistency of the analysis. In the study, the thermochemical progress over a spray plume was measured by simultaneously obtaining IR digital images in two spectral bands at successive instants of time during the reaction period, which generated some new findings. In general the thermal image appeared strong after the premixed combustion stage. The results processed by the two-colored method indicated that there were low temperature zones near the spray axis. This phenomena was explained to take place due to either the spray formation process involving the hollow spray injected into a narrow-height combus- tion volume or the unstable high-speed flows compounded by the latent heat of evaporation. The soot concentration distributions inferred from KL valves were compared with the temperature distri- butions obtained from the spectral digital images. High soot concen- tration zones indicated by KL were found between the low tempera- ture and high temperature zones. This is interpreted that zones at low temperatures were not expected to produce large amounts of soot because the reactions there were expected to be slow while those at high temperatures consumed the soot at high rates. Under the engine and operating conditions investigated in this study, the computa- tional results failed to predict the measurement results. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941733. Computer simulation of electric-, gas turbine-, and gas turbine hybrid electric vehicles. Leon Liebenberg and André L. Nel, Rand Afrikaans Univ.; and Keith R. Pullen, Imperial Col- lege, University of London. Computer simulations of a gas turbine series hybrid electric vehi- cle, purely electric vehicle and a gas turbine vehicle (with mechani- cal transmission) have been developed. The simulation results are compared with published results of conventional diesel and diesel- electric passenger cars, on the basis of a common engine type and driving schedule. The gas turbine series hybrid electric vehicle delivers the lowest emissions of all, although its specific fuel con- sumption (sfc) is higher than that of a diesel electric passenger car; the gas turbine hybrid electric vehicle's performance is however sensitive to the gas turbine size, battery capacity, and control law employed. 941734. Gas dynamic modelling and experiment validation for the exhaust muffler of a spark ignition engine. Xiaogang Yao, Imperial College of Science and Technology; and Changqi Cheng, Beijing Institute of Technology. This paper describes a gas-dynamic model for the basis elements of exhaust mufflers in a spark ignition (SI) engine. Attention has been paid in particular to the modelling of the concentric tube reso- nator with a perforated pipe inside, since this element has been a problem for gas dynamic modelling (GDM) of mufflers. The model was coupled with a previously developed engine simulation code, ENGWA-1, for both acoustic and gas dynamic performance analy- sis of mufflers. Measured pressures in the positions of interest in a practical exhaust system and exhaust noise spectra from a tail pipe were compared with simulations for validating the model. Results show that the model can satisfactorily predict measurements. More- over, how to use the computer code for muffler design has been dis- cussed for the point of engineering application. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941735. Droplet breakup in turbulent flows. Changyou Chen and Ali Veshagh, University of Warwick. For high Reynolds number flows, the fine structure turbulence is universal in the inertial subrange according to the Kolmogorov local isotropy theory; which for low-to-moderate Reynolds number flows, the turbulence tends to display a common structure for a par- ticular type of shear flows from the Townsend structural similarity. The power laws for the turbulent flows reflect the similarity in the turbulence fine structure. The paper discusses the relationship between drop breakup and turbulence fine structure. A predictive formula for drop breakup in the turbulent flow is suggested based on the energy balance between turbulence separating kinetic energy (i.e. turbulence structure func- tion) and surface tension. The model has been validated on a number of empirical relations for drop breakup in different turbulent flows. It is known that the drop size distribution in shear flows can be approximately expressed by a lognormal distribution. Using statisti- cal approach, the paper provides a theoretical proof on this fact. The model describes that the drop breakup experiences a cascade split- ting process and the drop size tends to be asymptotically lognor- mally distributed. A numerical example is given to illustrate details of the breakup process. 941737. Impact toughness of mower blades. Darrel L. Turner, Fisher Barton Inc. The purpose of this work is to improve the safety and durability of agricultural and off highway rotary cutter blades. Field experi- ence has resulted in specifying low blade hardness to prevent cata- strophic impact failure and the obvious safety concerns. However, low hardness reduces yield strength and increases failures from bending, fatigue and wear. To develop a relationship between impact toughness and blade performance in the field, we chose to examine the material mechanical property of notched impact tough- ness as measured by the ASTM E-23 Charpy V-notch Impact Test. The first part of this work was to do a survey of the industry for charpy notched impact toughness on commercially available blades. The results showed a wide range of hardness and charpy toughness. Impact testing also showed that impact toughness can be controlled to higher minimum values than previously available. The variables studied indicate that the microstructure produced in the heat treat process has the largest influence on toughness. Also, recent field experience indicates that material above the industry average appears to be a safe toughness level for most applications. This sug- gests blades with more resistance to bending, fatigue and wear can be produced at safe toughness levels. 941738. Design formula to predict retained steel bolt stretch when joining A380 aluminum components at high temperatures. James Webster, Kohler Co. 214</page><page sequence="214">941738-941749 A380 die-cast aluminum engine components are usually joined with steel bolts. Aluminum creep at higher temperatures causes a loss of bolt preload, measured as bolt stretch. A design formula pre- dicting retained bolt stretch is developed based on aluminum creep. This formula correlates well with experimental results for one head gasket and one connecting rod assembly. The formula predicts the effect of joint changes in washers, spacers, bolt size, etc. 941740. (SP- 1048) Using virtual reality to test vehicle steering systems. Matthew F. Vande Wiele, Richard C. Coddington, and Dee A. Chapman, University of Illinois. In order to test and design vehicle systems it is often necessary to develop prototypes. A vehicle's steering system requires a quali- tative analysis since it is difficult to quantify and measure subjective quantities such as the "feel" of a steering system. The virtual proto- type system (VPS) provides an effective and flexible way of devel- oping and testing the prototypes for qualitative testing. By creating a computer model of a vehicle's steering system using a dynamic simulation package and linking it to a virtual reality vehicle, a designer can drive the virtual prototype vehicle as if he or she were operating an actual vehicle. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars 941741. (SP- 1048) Development of idealistic hydromount characteristics to minimize engine induced vibrations using unconstrained minimization. N. Suresh, S. Shankar, and V. Bokil, E.G.S., Inc. The paper presents the results of the development work on engine mounts. The objective of the present study is to develop ide- alistic hydromount stiffness and damping characteristics, to mini- mize the engine induced vibrations over a wide frequency range. A total system level non-linear unconstrained optimizer is used to develop the optimum frequency dependent stiffness and damping characteristics, locations and orientations. Typical engine inertial values and packaging constraints representing a traditional three mount rear wheel drive power plant system, is used in the present study. The front two mounts are hydromounts and the rear mount is an elastomeric mount. The study is performed using unit har- monic excitations with a broad frequency range, since the typical engine inertial values are modeled and not an actual engine. A wide range of values for stiffness (minimum and maximum), are sub- jected to frequency constraints, manufacturing (compression to shear stiffness ratio) constraints and other standard criterion such as roll decoupling, etc. The main goal of this study is to minimize the force transmitted from the engine into the body structure or other subsystems in order to reduce the tactile and acoustic responses. A forced frequency response optimization technique is used to develop various sets of frequency dependent mount stiffness and damping characteristics, orientations and locations which satisfy all con- straints and result in minimum transmissibility corresponding to each excitation frequency. A proprietary intelligent scheme is then used to sort all of these results and select one set which will produce minimum transmissibility over a wide frequency range of interest. The mathematical formulation coded in EGS/ISOLATOR, rigorous enough to develop mount characteristics in total system level, is used for this study. For the considered problem, two governing designs are identi- fied. Front governing design leads to lower transmissibility in the front mounts and the rear governing leads to lower transmissibility in the rear mount. Rear governing design is recommended for this case, as it leads to lower transmissibility into the body structure and hence a reduction in the overall acoustic response. 941743.

(SP- 1048) Vacuum die casting technology with true T6 heat treating capability. Craig A. Nelson, OMC Research Cen- ter. Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC) developed its own vacuum die casting process to produce true T6 heat treatable aluminum die castings. This process was initiated by OMC Research and devel- oped jointly with OMC Waukegan. The project began 1990 and was put into production in 1992 on the outboard motor lower mount bracket. OMC is producing vacuum die cast aluminum parts made with 356.0 alloy and T6 heat treated which meet or exceed the strength of similarly alloyed and processed permanent mold or lost foam cast parts. The application of this process is being expanded within the realm of structural outboard motor parts to include other mounting brackets, as well as fuel system components. An automotive die caster is using the technology and equipment provided by OMC to produce leak tight air conditioner compressor housings. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Manufacturing and Materials 941746. How to identify and educate creative engineers. Arnold B. Skromme, Consultant. When selecting employees for new design and research work, it is important to obtain their grade in creativity. Several reliable tests for creativity are available. Validation has been made by testing many excellent inventors and control persons. The relationship between inventor's grades in creativity and their academic grades shows little correlation. The best departmental balance appears to be one with high cre- ativity (and often average IQ), and up to five high IQ engineers, in the opinion of the author. We need to develop new curricula to train highly creative people. 941748. Using pro/engineer and ansys in undergraduate engi- neering education. Karthik Ramani and David Henderson, Purdue Univ. The authors relate their experience in teaching a senior level Computer- Aided Design (CAD) course in Mechanical Engineering using advanced Computer-Aided Engineering software. The course balances the theory and the need for hands-on experience with com- mercial CAD software in solving practical design problems. Stu- dents are given assignments ranging from simple 3D modeling exer- cises and 2D finite element analyses to an optimization project requiring more advanced 3D modeling and analysis. Where possi- ble, analytical solutions are found and compared to the finite ele- ment results. The software allows the students to explore much more complex problems than would have otherwise been possible. 941749. New methods to achieve 100% placement of under- graduate engineers.

Regenerative testing of hydraulic pump/motor sys- tems. G. Babbitt , J. Lumkes, P. Lucier, F. Fronczak, and N. Beach- ley , University of Wisconsin-Madison. Regenerative testing methods can be used to allow the testing of hydraulic pumps and motors at significantly higher power and flow levels than that of the power supply used. This method can also increase the accuracy of system efficiency measurements. The increase in accuracy is realized because only the power added to compensate for the system losses needs to be measured with great accuracy. Typically, for the operation points of interest this will be a much smaller quantity than the overall power of the system. Knowing that the error in flow measurements is a function of the quantity measured, the benefit of measuring the losses becomes clear. An additional, distinct advantage of regenerative testing is that no dynamometer or load is needed. This results in a much simpler teat setup. This paper documents the development of such a test pro- gram at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 941751. Effect of low molecular weight carboxylic acids on hydraulic pump wear. G. E. Totten, R. J. Bishop, Jr., and R. L. McDaniels, Union Carbide Corp.; and D. P. Braniff, and D. J. Irvine, Forsythe Lubrication Associates Ltd. All types of hydraulic fluids may encounter thermal excursions at some point during their lifetime in use. When this occurs, there is the potential for the formation of degradation by- products. For most hydraulic fluids, including water-glycols, these degradation by-products include various low molecular weight carboxylic acids, e.g. formic acid and acetic acid. This paper describes the potential formation of these acids and the impact of their presence on wear and corrosion of hydraulic systems. 941752. Performance map characterization of hydraulic flu- ids. Lavern D. Wedeven, Wedeven Associates ; and George E. Totten and Roland J. Bishop, Jr., Union Carbide Corp. There is increasing interest in the development of bench tests to characterize the performance of hydraulic fluids in order to mini- mize the cost of testing and the volumes of fluid currently required for pump testing. One method which permits comprehensive charac- terization of the boundary, mixed EHD and EHD wear regimes encountered in pump lubrication is to develop a performance map. This paper discusses the use of this testing method to characterize the performance of two experimental hydraulic fluid formulations. 941753. (SP- 1050) An investigation into air flow characteris- tics through inlet valve of directed ports. Ruilin Liu, Fuming Xiao, and Lizhe Guan, Tianjin Univ.; and Xunjun Liu, Jilin Univer- sity of Technology. The velocity and turbulence intensity profiles at exit of intake valve from typical SI engine intake ports (horizontal and sloping directed ports) were measured by hot wire anemometry (HWA) in a steady flow rig. The characteristics of velocity and turbulence intensity distribution under different valve lifts and at distances along valve axis were analyzed and compared between above two intake ports. Results showed that velocity and turbulence intensity profiles are strongly dependent on intake port form, valve lift and surrounding geometry, they vary not only around valve head periph- ery but also along valve axis. 941754. (SP- 1050) A microscopic analysis of in-cylinder swirl generated by directed ports. Xunjun Liu, Jilin University of Tech- nology; and Ruilin Liu, Fuming Xiao, and Lizhe Guan, Tianjin Univ. Based on 3-dimensional velocity data at intake valve exit area of typical SI engine intake ports (horizontal and sloping directed ports) measured by hot wire anemometry in a steady flow rig, the magni- tudes and compositions of inflow angular momentum flux and swirl ratios at the end of induction process generated by each velocity component were computed at different intake valve lifts and dis- tances along valve axis. A microscopic evaluation method was pro- vided for evaluating intake port characteristics according to intake valve exit flow field. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941755. (SP- 1050) A study on off-road diesel engines emission reduction. Arto Puranen, Tampere university of Technology; and Tuomas Tanska, Wartsila Diesel International Ltd. Field tests were performed in order to find diesel engine load parameters for typical farm tasks. Computer programs for evaluat- ing farm tractor load parameters and calculating the specific emis- sions for each load cycle were made. Typical load parameters are presented. Because of quite low load factors, the specific emissions are quite high. Fuel consumption can be lowered 10% by changing the engine operating point to a higher level. If the engine is operated near the optimal fuel consumption, emissions except NOx were on low level. Hydraulically operated machines have highly transient load, which influence mostly Co, HC, and PM emissions. 941756.

This paper provides a new measuring technique to obtain the concentration and temperature field of a unsymmetrical three dimensional transient diesel spray by the laser interfero- holo- graphic and tomographic analysis. The theory to get the concentra- tion and temperature distribution of a spray by laser technique is stated in detail. The experimental installation and optical system are given concretely.

In the design development of fuel injection equipment; computer simulation of the fuel injection process can be a powerful tool. This paper brings out the development of an extended computer simula- tion for the fuel injection process, including the cavitation effects. For the solution of equations in the finite difference form, Newton Raphson method has been used. The program has been validated by capturing on line data using the high speed data acquisition system. The validated simulation model has been used to carry out an exhaustive parametric study of the fuel injection system of a large medium speed diesel engine to bring out the injection system param- eters which significantly influence the fuel injection system perfor- mance. 941758. A vegetable oil based tractor lubricant. Richard E. Gapinski, Lubrizol Corp.; and Ivan E. Joseph and Brian D. Lay zeli, Lubrizol International Labs. Increased awareness of preserving the environment has moti- vated the development of a wide variety of environmentally compat- ible products. Such products include environmentally compatible lubricants. Sale and use of these types of lubricants illustrates dili- gence by the lubricant manufacturer, original equipment manufac- turer (OEM), and the consumer in contributing to a cleaner environ- ment. The use of this type of lubricant could enhance the image of the lubricant manufacturer and vendor as well as the equipment manufacturer who employs such a fluid. To base such a lubricant on a vegetable oil creates a product environmentally friendly by its farming origin and its ability to readily biodegrade if released. No machinery is so uniquely suited to using vegetable oil based lubricants as agricultural equipment. Since this equipment is partic- ularly close to the environment, the lubricant can easily come in contact with the soil, ground water, and crops. The opportunity exists to create a continuous cycle in which the agricultural equip- ment is lubricated by oil from a plant growing in the field being cul- tivated by that same equipment. 216</page><page sequence="216">941758-941767 This situation prompted Lubrizol and a leading OEM to partici- pate in a joint project, which has resulted in the first successful rape- seed oil (canola) based tractor hydraulic fluid. This fluid is a Univer- sal Tractor Transmission Oil (UTTO) and is suitable for lubricating the transmission, axle, and hydraulic system. This paper will expand on these subjects, will also discuss the advantages of using rapeseed oil, and present data which demon- strates the lubricant's performance and biodegradability. 941759. selection of an environmentally friendly hydraulic fluid for use in turf equipment. Jim Meni, Jacobsen Textron. The ever increasing concern over the contamination of ground water and the high cost of clean up from hydraulic fluid spills has resulted in the need to establish an approved biodegradable hydrau- lic fluid for use in mobile equipment and in particular turf care equipment. This paper will review; the status of what is considered "Envi- ronmentally Friendly;;, the establishing of a selection criteria, types of fluids investigated and the locating of potential sources, in addi- tion, the testing and selection of an acceptable fluid will be dis- cussed including continuing activity in this area. 941760. Potential utilization of soybean oil as an industrial hydraulic oil. Lou A. T. Honary, University of Northern Iowa. The use of vegetable oils as fuels and as lubricants has been known for many years. The current environmental awareness has provided a new impetus for developing the so called "green" prod- ucts by various industries. Most have selected vegetable oils that are more naturally [oxidatively] stable and are suitable for use in indus- trial applications. Rapeseed, in particular, has been investigated by many European and American companies for development of indus- trial lubricants. The purpose of this study, however, has been to investigate the potential utilization of soybean oils as an industrial hydraulic fluid. The results have shown that soybean oils, like other vegetable oils, present good lubricating and wear protection performances. Lack of desired oxidative stability and the subsequent polymerization of the used oil, however, appear to be the main concerns. Three approaches have been selected to address this concern. One is the use of geneti- cally modified soybeans with fatty acid compositions that are more oxidatively stable. The second is the chemical modification of the soybean oils using methyl esters and partially hydrogenated oils. A final approach is the use of various additives and property enhancers to improve performance of the soybean oils in hydraulic systems. While additional tests are being conducted, it is expected that one or more of the three approaches identified will help the development of a soybean based industrial hydraulic oil. To test performance of the soybean oil in other industrial applica- tions, various soybean oils were tested in a quenchalyzer to study potential use as a quench medium for heat treatment. Preliminary results showed soybean oils to have a better cooling rate than paraf- fin oils. Actual use in production heat treat environment is underway to study the oils' performances in high temperature applications. 941761. Analysis of off-line of action contact at the tips of gear teeth. Avinashchandra Singh and Donald R. Houser, Ohio State Univ. A mathematical basis for predicting loaded off-line of action contact at the tips of undermodified gear teeth is discussed. Two methods of solving the contact problem, using a modified simplex algorithm, are used to predict the load distribution. The methods doffer in the compliance matrix formulation and the way they search for contact. The first method uses a tapered plate model and the sec- ond method uses a finite element model. The effects of off-line of action contact on load sharing, effective contact ratio and motion curves are shown. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941762. Development of new friction material for heavy duty application. T. Kuse, Komatsu Ltd.; S. Nakazawa, Toshiba Tun- galoy Co., Ltd.; A. Shibata, Komatsu Ltd.; and M. Fujihara, Toshiba Tungaloy Co., Ltd. Studies into a material to improve the power density of power- shift transmissions and brake systems have revealed that the poros- ity and elasticity of wet friction materials have a large influence on dynamic friction coefficient and energy absorption capacity. From this basic idea, a new wet friction material for heavy-duty applica- tion has been developed. This friction material is a resin molding composed principally of high heat-resistant resin, graphite and fibers. Its advantages include a far higher energy absorption capacity than current sintered bronze material, a high friction coefficient, excellent slip endurance, and high thermal stability. These characteristics are mainly the result of a manufacturing method which provides low elasticity and high porosity, as well as necessary strength. The results of extensive testing confirmed the concept of the new friction material. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941763. Communication between and within agricultural equipment. D. Goense and J. W. Hofstee, Wageningen Agricultural Univ. A generic approach for the modeling of information in relation to mobile agricultural equipment is presented, this modeling is a prerequisite for the communication between and within agricultural equipment. The approach is based on a high level of abstraction for the reproduction of agricultural equipment. This generic approach is worked out for equipment to apply products. Further the concept and the requirements for a hierarchical coordinate system to be used in agriculture are presented. 941764. Electro-hydraulic draft control (EDC)system description for a variety of tractors. Abraham Orbach, Case, J. I. A controller for a three point hitch is described. It includes five separate states which govern the operation and performance of the hitch. The control objective in each state is explained in detail. The actual transitions between the states, which are controlled based on external events, are given via a transition table and some examples. Such transitions are triggered by both; the operator and, in certain circumstances, by the conditions of the soil, tractor speed, etc. The controlled is designed to allow adapting it to various tractors under different types of loading conditions, hydraulic cylinder volumes, and options available on the tractor. Controller operation is also adjusted based on battery voltage as well as the electro-hydraulic valve coil resistance. Failures, which are being continuously searched for, are divided into four categories which manipulate and modify the performance of the hitch. Finally, the draft state is explained in detail and examples of hitch operations with different implements are described. Field results are mapped and analyzed in the position/load domain. 941765. Development of electronic fan control systems. James B. Maddock, David B. Maddock, and David V. Gile, Caterpillar Inc. Engine cooling fan systems for off-highway machinery require a significant amount of horsepower and contribute to the overall noise level of the machine. Reducing fan speed in times of low cool- ing demand provides a means to reduce vehicle noise levels and divert engine horsepower from the fan to do productive work. The fan must, however, continue to provide adequate air-flow when demanded by the cooling system. Electronic fan controls that modu- late fan speed to meet changing cooling system requirements pro- vide the above advantages. 941767. The legal protection of technology. Casimir F .

An issued patent is infringed if the accused device or method has all of the elements of a single patent claim, or their equivalents. Propri- etary rights also exist in trade secrets and confidential information, even if the trade secrets and confidential information are unpatent- able. Rights in trade secrets are retained by keeping the information secret, by confidentiality agreements, or in some cases, by disclos- ing the confidential information to another in a confidential relation- ship. Rights in trade secrets and confidential information are typi- cally lost when the information becomes generally known or pub- licly available, although in some cases the rights exist even after the information becomes publicly available. A company receives tech- nological information from its employees and the law provides for determination of the respective rights of an employee and the employer in inventions made by the employee. Engineers and tech- nical employees may be treated differently than non-technical employee-inventors and the rights of all employees may be varied by agreement with the employer. Employment agreements may also restrict the activities of an employee after termination. Companies obtain patents to protect the results of their research and develop- ment from their competitors. In a patent infringement or trade secret theft lawsuit brought to enforce intellectual property rights, the pro- tectability of the invention or trade secret is typically in issue. The engineer's role in the lawsuit is to assist the attorney in understand- ing the technology and in presenting the technical information in a way that a non-technical judge or jury may understand. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941768.

Crookston, Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd.; and H. R. Martin, University of Waterloo. Simulating the performance of components before manufactur- ing can increase the efficiency of the design and manufacturing pro- cess by identifying areas of potential weakness. There are three prin- ciple areas to assess in checking the integrity of a design, static load- ing, fatigue loading and dynamic loading. Calculation of the first two are commonly used to predict life. Dynamic modeling is less commonly used, although it often reveals loading levels in excess of predicted fatigue loads. This paper investigates such a condition that resulted in plastic deformation of a hydraulic cylinder. 941771. (SP- 1050) Physical factors affecting hydrocarbon oxidation in a diesel oxidation catalyst. Jon E. Johnson, U.S. Bureau of Mines; and David B. Kittelson, University of Minnesota. A study of factors affecting hydrocarbon oxidation in a diesel oxidation catalyst was undertaken. The objective was to determine whether interactions between particulate-adsorbed hydrocarbons and the catalyst significantly influenced hydrocarbon oxidation. Theoretical modeling supported by experimental data obtained at the U.S. Bureau of Mines' Diesel Emissions Research Laboratory indicated that the mass of particles interacting with the ceramic sup- port was negligible. Additionally, a model of hydrocarbon adsorp- tion onto diesel particulate predicted that over 98% by mass of exhaust hydrocarbons would be gas-phase, rather than particulate- adsorbed, at converter operating temperatures. A second physical process, the diffusion of gas phase hydrocarbons to the catalytic sur- face, was subsequently investigated. Theoretical and experimental results for the unburnt fuel hydrocarbons indicated that hydrocarbon oxidation was diffusion limited under high temperature operating conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941772.

Engine and Dalian Univer- sity of Technology; and Zhao Xiuren, Chemical Engineering Col- lege and Dalian University of Technology. The catalytic conversions of diesel exhausting particulates (DEP) are studied in this paper. The oxidation catalysts, carried by Y-AI2O3 pellets, are prepared with the method of impregnation. By use of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique, the catalytic abilities of these catalysts are studied and the igniting characteristics of DEP are determined. A mathematical method is introduced to process TGA experimental data furtherly. Some equations have been derived to evaluate the kinetic parameters of the oxidation reaction of DEP. By comparing the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction and the igniting temperature (Ti) of DEP, the catalytic activities of the oxidation catalysts are evaluated. 941773. (SP- 1050) Development and application experience of diesel catalytic converters. Zhang Guanglong, Liang Lunhui, and Chen Jiahua, Research Institute ofl.C. Engine and Dalian Uni- versity of Technology; and Zhao Xiuren, Chemical Engineering College and Dalian University of Technology. This paper mainly deals with the harmful emission control prob- lem of the diesel engine. Many research works have been carried out on the catalytic conversion of diesel emissions. First, a few kinds of catalyst are prepared, selected by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). Three types of catalytic converter are developed. Engine bench tests on these con- verters loaded with selected catalysts are made. Testing contents are: (1) conversion rate of harmful gases; (2) reduction effect of exhaust smoke; (3) resistant performance of converters and their influences on the engine, etc. Finally, through comparison, the effective catalytic converter is installed on a forklift truck for testing and durability examination. Testing results show that the catalytic converter has higher conversion rate on gaseous emissions, espe- cially for Co and NOx. After two months running, the conversion rates basically keep the original level. Otherwise, because of special considerations in the converter structure design, it shows some effects on the reduction of diesel exhaust smoke and noise. So it can meet with the special needs of the forklift truck working in closed area, such as ship depository. 941774.

Zhang Chunrun and Min Jiayi, Engineering College of Transportation; and Liang Lunhui, Chen Jiahua, Liu Junmin, and Li Chengbin, Research Institute of I.C. Engine and Dalian University of Technology. It is a new idea and beneficial attempt that the microwave heating technology is applied to regenerate the Diesel Exhaust Particulate Filters (DEPF). In this paper, the microwave regenerating mecha- nism of DEPF is studied and some laws in the process of microwave 218</page><page sequence="218">941774-941782 regeneration are found by experimental and theoretical analyses. Some basic measurements and calculations of microwave character- istic factors of three kinds of selected DEPF and the pure particu- lates are presented. A Microwave Regenerating Test System (MRTS) is set and the microwave regeneration of DEPF is tested. A mathematical model of two dimensional axi-symmetrical non- steady temperature field is set up which is suitable for microwave regenerating process of ceramic foam filters. The numerical calcula- tion and practical analyses are stated. It is proved by these studies that the particulate in DEPF is selectively heated by microwave energy and moreover the microwave energy is less absorbed by the pure ceramic filters. The microwave regeneration of DEPF is feasi- ble from the point of economic effects, social benefit and technol- ogy. The power of MRTS which makes DEPF safely and effectively regenerated can be controlled under 1000W, even around 600W. 941775. (SP- 1050) DEsign improvement on diesel particulate bag filters. Fuming Xiao , National Engine Combustion Lab.; Tian- jin Univ.; and Xunjun Liu , College of Automotive Engineering; Jilin University of Technology. In order to improve the compactness and simplify the structure of diesel particulate bag filter, a preliminary design and test of an envelope bag filter were carried out, and the results confirmed that it is unpractical to adopt envelope bag in diesel particulate bag filter design. Therefore, another double-layer tube bag filter was devel- oped which has a compact and simple structure. The filter was tested on a 485Q diesel engine dynamometer bench, and the results showed that it worked reliably with particulate collection efficiency more than 90% and its effect on diesel economy no more than 1%. 941776. A review of free piston engine concepts. Peter A. J. Achten, Innas B. V. In free piston engines, the stroke of the piston is used directly to produce hydraulic, pneumatic or electric energy. This can be done with a single piston in one combustion chamber, or with more pis- tons in one or more combustion chambers. The different designs of free piston engines can be divided into three categories: 'single pis- ton', 'dual piston' and 'opposed piston'. All three categories of free piston engines have their own specific advantages and disadvantages. This paper evaluates the conceptual differences. The evaluation will be restricted to free piston engines with compression ignition at the combustion chamber side and hydraulic energy production at the user side. The evaluation will be supported with measured data on the diesel hydraulic engine which has been developed by the Dutch company Innas BV. The evaluation shows that the single piston concept is favorable compared to both other concepts. The single piston engine had advantages regarding costs, efficiency, control, and the simplicity of its construction. The evaluation also shows that the single piston concept has no disadvantages regarding vibrations, not even when the piston stroke is not balanced with a counter weight. By means of choosing the correct mounting, almost all vibration transfer to the frame can be avoided. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941777. Performance design of hydraulic mount for low fre- quency engine vibration and noise control. Kyu H. Lee and Young T. Choi, Korea Automotive Technology Institute; and Sang P. Hong, Pyung-Hwa industrial Co., Ltd. The use of the hydro-elastic mount for passenger car engine as well as for heavy vehicle diesel engine is increasingly becoming common in the industry because they can provide excellent fre- quency and amplitude response characteristics compared to the con- ventional elasto-rubber type engine mount. Numerous articles have been attempted up to now to explain the complex performance char- acteristics of those mount but is not fully understood yet. In the pres- ent study a hydro engine mount with a circular inertia track and a free decoupler is designed for a 110 PS class In-line diesel engine in order to control and reduce the high amplitude low frequency vibration and noise in frequency range of 1 - 50 Hz in particular. A linear lumped model is developed in the study to analyze the dynamic response characteristics and the dynamic spectra results from the model are validated with experimental data over 1 - 50 Hz. Special emphasis has been placed on the design parameter studies, such as orifice diameters and length of inertia track, to tune the mount performance for the specific mount design requirements as well as to predict the performance characteristics in the pre-design stage. Applying these results to the mount design process a method- ology to improve or tune the required basic performance of the mount is obtained. 941778. Development of single cylinder Di diesel engine type 1102 with horizontal cylinder. Zhengbai Liu and Guorong Qi, Dalian University of Technology. Based on diesel engine type S1100A, the cylinder bore is expanded from 100 mm to 102 mm and the swirl chamber combus- tion system is substituted by the direct injection combustion system, as a result, a new type of single cylinder direct injection diesel engine with horizontal cylinder, i.e., diesel engine type 1102, has been developed, in which the rated speed has increased from 2200 rpm to 2300 rpm, the rated output has increased from 11 kw to 12.5 kw, and the specific fuel consumption has reduced by 19 g/kw.h, from 253 g/kw.h to 234 g/kw.h at the rated condition. This paper presents the design ides, the principal engine specifi- cations, the structural features, and the experimental results of the single cylinder direct injection diesel engine type 1102 with hori- zontal cylinder. The experimental results have shown that the diesel engine type 1102 has obtained the good indexes of performance. This new diesel engine has been put into mass production in an engine corporation at the present time. 941779. Heat transfer through ceramic barrier coatings used in internal combustion engines. Andrzej Mruk, Witold Jordan, Jan Taler, Stanislaw Łopata, and Bohdan Weglowski, Cracow Univer- sity of Technology. The paper presents the results of research concerned with heat exchange through surfaces covered with a thin ceramic layer. Theo- retical analysis has been carried out to show that the presence of a ceramic layer reduced the density of heat flux flowing through the tested surface, provided the convection heat transfer coefficient is constant-the same as for surfaces without any ceramic layer. Heat exchange for three kinds of thin heat- insulting layers has been examined at a specially designed test stand. The ceramic layers were made of Z1O2 partially stabilized with Y2O3 or Ln2Ü3 and a plasma coated onto the base of the Al alloy. The density of heat flux, heat transfer coefficient equivalent, and heat resistance of the ceramic layer have been established. It has been proven that in the case of thin heat- insulating coatings of metal surfaces, the establishment of conductive heat resistance is not the only or the most decisive factor affecting heat exchange through such systems. Heat exchange is greatly affected by porosity, roughness and emissivity. Taking into consideration the above, it follows that knowing only the layer thickness and thermal conductivity value is not enough to make cal- culations of heat flux applied to surfaces with tested layer. In such cases heat exchange can be examined only be means of experimen- tation. 941782. Sensitivity of test cycle and fuel type on a spark- ignition four-stroke inboard marine engine. Michael J. Samulski, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An inboard marine engine was tested on a dynamometer for exhaust emissions. This paper gives some insight into the character- ization of baseline emissions for a new marine inboard engine as well as potential emission reductions through the use of oxygenated fuels. As the percentage of alcohol in the fuel increased. HC and CO decreased and NOx increased without a significant change in power. Fuel consumption also increased slightly. 219</page><page sequence="219">941782-941791 In addition, the sensitivity of the test cycle on exhaust emissions was investigated using four transient and two steady- state cycles. Only HC seemed to be affected by the amount of transience added. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941783. Influence of the fuel injection equipment on NOx emissions and particulates on a large heavy-duty two-stroke die- sel engine operating on water-in-fuel emulsion. Svend Henning- sen, MAN B and W Diesel A/S. Tests were carried out with the aim of studying the influence of the fuel-injection equipment (FIE) on gaseous and particulate-mass (PM) emissions when using water-in-fuel emulsion. The tests included different pump-nozzle combinations, a new slide-valve- type fuel injector, water-in-fuel emulsion and different fuel-sulphur contents. The NOx reduction is compared with the results of several other tests in large two-stroke engines using water emulsions. A NOx reduction of approximately 25% was obtained using a large pump-nozzle combination and 30% added water, without dete- rioration in the specific fuel oil consumption. The NOx behavior is correlated to the injection intensity as well as to a water-amount effect. Fuel sulphur has a major influence on PM, as sulphates account for approximately 35% of the total PM when operating on 'normal' heavy fuel. A linear approximation estimates the 'non-sulphur' fuel PM at between 30 and 60 mg/Nm3, depending on the FIE system. No simple correlation was found to explain the PM behavior in the test. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941784. Manne diesel exhaust emissions measured by porta- ble instruments. Alan P. Bentz and Elizabeth Weaver, U.S. Coast Guard R and D Center. Briefcase-sized analyzers, originally designed for monitoring emissions from land-based smokestack gases, have been adapted to shipboard use. The results are comparable to those of much larger, rack-mounted devices used on shore, or the multiple instruments used by Lloyd's Register on shipboard. Portable monitors are partic- ularly useful for small vessels, and have been applied to hot exhausts directly out of turbochargers, instead of the usual smokestack mea- surements. The test protocol evolved during this study will be useful in monitoring diesel engine exhaust emissions, before and after application of emission reduction techniques to assess their efficacy. Initial shipboard testing was conducted on three 82-ft U.S. Coast Guard Cutters (WPBs). The test protocol used was one based on the ISO 8178 procedure, taking into account the speeds actually used by the vessels-their operating profile. Variables examined, aside from the effects of shaft rpm on the pollutant levels, were: water depth, current, effect of towing another boat, wind direction and sea state. Pollution was determined quantitatively as a function of power, and also fuel consumption. Shaft speed, as on larger vessels, showed the greatest effect on the pollutants - with much more scatter at lower speeds (&lt;30% of full power). As expected, cold starts and accelerating transients had higher NOx levels than at steady state for short durations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941786. Catalytic converter applications for two stroke, spark-ignited marine engines. Hiroaki Fujimoto, Atsushi Isogawa, and Naoto Matsumoto, Sanshin Industries Co., Ltd. When catalytic converters are used for cleansing of exhaust gas from two-stroke marine engines, new issues must be brought up in combination with prior technology. Therefore, a study was made of V6, 2600cc engines having a large volume of hydrocarbon emis- sions with respect to three issues: 1) to what degree seawater effects catalytic converter performance and possible countermeasures; 2) effects attained on cleansing level and catalyst temperature; 3) find- ing abatement levels for catalyst degradation and exhaust emission output in the marine mode. It was found that physical adsorption was a significant factor in catalytic degradation resulting from direct contact with seawater. The cleansing levels obtained when a marine engine is equipped with a catalyst converter were found by clarifying the extent of effects of catalyst volume, performance and temperature. The reduc- tion obtained in exhaust emissions allowing for a degradation factor, is shown in a catalytic converter heated to the maximum tempera- ture of 960°C. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941787. A standardized method for evaluating debris resis- tance of rolling element bearings. Harvey P. Nixon, Harry Zan- topulos, and J. David Cogdell, Timken Co. Debris resistant bearings are being promoted by various bearing manufacturers as a solution for many contaminated lubrication envi- ronments. The baseline for such claims is often unclear for the bear- ing user and leaves questions as to how the information relates to specific field applications. In order to determine the benefits, if any, of these new product offerings and to assess their effectiveness, a standard method of evaluation is needed. An approach to satisfying this need is described and typical results are provided for several commercially available bearing products. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941788. The dependence of roller bearing surface fatigue on lambda ratio and other variables. Y. P. Chiù, Tor rington Co. A close examination has been made on the result of experimental research on surface fatigue in the low Lambda regimes. These experiments consist of two kinds. One is the endurance test of nee- dle bearings, ball bearings and roller bearings with different surface and lubrication conditions. The other is the test with disk machines to observe peeling (or micropitting). The study shows that the Lambda ratio is not the only parameter which affects the surface fatigue of bearings. In most cases, the file ratio depends more strongly on the composite rms surface roughness than on film thick- ness. Thus, in addition to the Lambda ratio, the effects of asperity height/tip radius ratio, nominal contact pressure, mean separation, lubricant inlet starvation, surface defect, hardness and the compres- sive residual (or tensile hoop) stress on surface fatigue, should be taken into account. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941789. Electronic control system for GENESIS™ 70 series tractors. Steven C. Young, Ford New Holland. The CAN multiplexed network used on the new GENESIS™ 70 series tractors allows for integrated control and monitoring of the engine, transmission, and hydraulic subsystems on this series of vehicles. Basic design philosophies for successful multiplexed net- works, and experiences and conclusions concerning the use of CAN on the GENESIS 70 series tractors are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941790. Design and development of new generation skid steer loaders. Dale A. Ashcroft, Edward H. Priepke, and William J. Sau- ber, Ford New Holland. Ford New Holland invested in a project to provide a skid steer loader product line to be competitive over the long term in the grow- ing skid steer loader market. They designed and developed a new generation family of skid steer loaders which are customer- driven to be highly-reliable, and competitive in features and performance, while meeting company goals for cost-effective manufacturing. Pri- mary areas addressed in design and development were reliability, durability, serviceability, customer features and performance, com- plexity reduction and manufacturability. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941791. The new seríes of compact tractor from kubota. Kentaro Nakamura, Mutsumi Kana, Satoski Machida, Masayori Kajino, and Muneji Okamoto, Kubota Corp. 220</page><page sequence="220">941791-941799 In 1994, the Kubota Corporation launched the Grand "L" Series of compact tractors to the worldwide market. SAE J1 150 - TERMI- NOLOGY FOR AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT defines compact tractor as a small agricultural tractor equipped with a 540rpm rear PTO (SAE J1170) and a three-point hitch designed for Category I (SAE J715) implements only. These tractors generally weigh less than 1800kg, have less than 30 PTO kw, and are primarily designed and advertised for use with mowers and light-duty material handling equipment. The concept behind the development of this series of tractors comprises of 4 basic types with PTO power ranging from 18.7 to 27.6 kW (25 to 37 HP). It offers operator comfort, excellent dexterity, and high performance efficiency in a compact tractor con- figuration. The tractor performs well without any special skill by the operator. Further, it can utilize with equal efficiency such varied applications as light construction, grounds maintenance, and agri- culture. In this paper, the author will explain the measures taken to develop the Grand 4 'L" Series of tractors using the basic concepts while demonstrating how such measure contributes to improved performance, maneuverability, and driving comfort in a variety of applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941792. Tools for sound quality analysis in complex sound fields. Alun Crewe, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. As worldwide competition for agricultural and construction equipment increases, manufacturers need to distinguish their prod- ucts in areas such as operator comfort and perceived quality. Advances in digital audio recording and high-speed computers have presented the noise and vibration engineer with the possibility of new tools and techniques for analyzing and processing sound. This paper discusses some of the recent developments in sound quality analysis in passenger cars and how they can be applied to similar engineering problems in off-highway vehicles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941793. Principal operating field shape analysis on a combine harvester. Dirk Otte, LMS International ; Bill Myers, LMS North America ; and Manfred Hermanski, Fachhochschule Bielefeld. This paper discusses the use of principal response analysis to earn insight in the operating behavior of a combine harvester, caus- ing objectionably high noise levels in the operators' s cabin. Princi- pal response analysis is able to extract more information from a set of operating response spectra, making use of multiple reference sig- nals, by entering the concept of dimensionality of operating (acous- tic and deflection) field shapes. The proposed method is demonstrated to offer a generic insight into the dimensionality of the problem (number of noise sources) and in the existence of possible noise transmission paths (air- borne as well as structure-borne) to the cabin. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941795. Electro-hydraulic valve coil drive techniques and their effects on valve performance. Thomas A. Chmielewski, Jr., Leonard Colavito, and Scott Demarest, Control Concepts, Inc. The mobile hydraulic market is increasing its use of electronics for hydraulic control systems. In order to be more cost competitive, these systems are beginning to use proportional electro-hydraulic valves as opposed to the more traditional and costly servo valves. Proportional valves may be operated in open loop fashion or in a closed loop fashion which includes feedback transducers. In either case, it is important for the system designer and ultimately the end user to understand the different types of performance that may result by utilizing various coil drive strategies with proportional control valves. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941796. Development of intelligent hydraulic excavator- hyper gx series. Koichi Kawamura, Seiji Kamada, and Mamoru Tochizawa, Komatsu Ltd. KOMATSU has successfully developed and marketed the HYPER GX series computer-controlled, intelligent hydraulic exca- vators. The development concepts of the HYPER GX series are as follows: 1. To improve safety at construction sites by use of measur- ing functions which reduce the number of ancillary workers. 2. To improve working environment and the quality of work by use of automatic functions which reduce operator fatigue and time required to complete a job. 3. To solve the problem of shortage of experi- enced workers by the use of operator support functions which allow easy operation even for inexperienced or older operators. Representative of these is the fully automatic grading function, with which the movement of boom, arm and bucket is computer- controlled to enable automatic excavation at a predetermined gradi- ent. Here, the operator simply needs to press a switch, allowing even inexperienced operators to execute straight digging easily and with- out fatigue, usually a very difficult operation requiring substantial experience. Additionally, the machine is equipped with 12 newly developed advanced functions, such as bucket monitor, electrically cushioned cylinders and soft mode (for shock-free movement). This machine is currently being used throughout Japan in a variety of job sites where it enjoys a high reputation. This paper presents the development concepts, configuration, functions and advantages of the HYPpR GX hydraulic excavator. 941797. To improve the performance of proportional valve controlled hydraulic rotary servo via nonlinear compensation. Y. F. Xiong and S. LeQuoc, Ecole de Technologie Supérieure; and R. M. H. Cheng, Concordia Univ. A hydraulic system is inherently nonlinear and sometimes its performance is greatly affected by those nonlinear factors such as deadband, saturation, hysteresis etc. For a system characterized with badly nonlinear behavior, the predominant nonlinearity must be well determined and compensated, otherwise the performance of the sys- tem will suffer. As an example, a hydraulic proportional valve con- trolled rotary motor servo is analyzed in this paper. Through theoret- ical analysis and experimentation result, a deadband is determined as the predominant nonlinearity in such system and parameters of the deadband are estimated by using system identification method. A nonlinear controller consisting of a linear pole-placement control algorithm and a deadband compensator is designed for the rotary hydraulic system. Experimental results illustrate that such a system controlled by this nonlinear controller exhibits much better overall performance as compared with that controlled by a conventional PI controller. We have also replaced the low-cost proportional valve by a servo valve to verify the overall system performance, which shows that a proportional valve can challenge a servo valve, if a proper nonlinear compensator is designed for the proportional valve. 941798. Design of electrohydraulic force loading system. S. LeQuoc and Y. F. Xiong, Ecole de Technologie Supérieure; and R. M. H. Cheng and H. Q. Zhang, Concordia Univ. This paper discusses the design of an electrohydraulic force load- ing system. This system is able to produce any desired arbitrary forces. As an example, the loading system is designed to load force to a hydraulic position servo. It is shown that if the loading system is designed by using a combination of a servo valve with critical center and a hydraulic cylinder to realize a force feedback close- loop system, the position system may generate a large additional force to frustrate this loading system to work properly. By using a bypass adjustable throttle valve across the two flow lines of the loading cylinder, it is verified by theoretic analysis and simulation that the additional force generated by position system can be greatly reduced. Because an asymmetric cylinder is used as the loading actuator, modelling of its characteristics is also carried out. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941799. Electro-hydraulic header control for combine har- vesters. R. Romes, Robert Bosch GmbH. 221</page><page sequence="221">941799-941806 A new control system for combine harvesters has been developed allowing vertical and lateral header control both above and on the ground. A further characteristic of this new control system is its active oscillation damping during transport with header installed. Above-ground header control with programmable stubble height operates without contact. The ground clearance is measured using ultrasonic sensors with adaptive signal filtering in order to distin- guish ground signals from crop signals. The ground pressure is controlled by reference to the measured pressure in the hydraulic lift cylinder. A high-resolution pressure sensor continually measures the residual weight of the header. The pressure signal in the lift cylinder is also used for active oscillation damping of the combine harvester's pitching motion. 941800. Retrofitting agricultural air-conditioning systems from cfc 12 to hfc 134a. A. M. Smith, Castrol International; and Peter Granville, Agricultural Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Engineering. This paper details a cost effective method of retrofitting agricul- tural and other off-highway vehicle air-conditioning systems cur- rently operating on CFC 12. The process described has been evolved over the past four years, based on experience gained in all sectors of the refrigeration market. Over two years of operation, retrofitted systems have proved to be as reliable as their CFC 12 counterparts. ACRE currently have over one hundred vehicles, ranging from pedestrian precinct sweepers to combine harvesters, from a variety of manufacturers, mid way through the process of retrofitting. The procedure outlined has a number of benefits when instigated as part of a planned maintenance system. It allows the service company the chance to build up stocks of reclaimed CFC 12 from systems they have already retrofitted whilst spreading the workload and cost to the operator, over a period of time. Adopting this process requires no additional equipment other than that currently required to service existing CFC 12 and HFC 134a systems. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941801. Long distance design produces a 260 ton coal hauler. John A. Cain, MEGA Corp.; and Ronald L. Hehn, Structures Unlim- ited. A high degree of technical competence is required to design off- highway equipment. Small companies with limited resources need to reduce their exposure to financial loss due to design errors. Larger companies may have reduced technical expertise due to down- siz- ing. The answer may lie with the increased use of contract technical experts. Historically certain industries and locals had this method to fulfill their contracts primarily with the government. One problem with this approach is to bring together widely scattered commercial companies with the experts for hire. Affordable CADD and FEM systems and modern communication methods make long distance design a reality. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941802. Design of vertical hydraulic telescopic lifting booms. David Duerr, 2DM Associates, Inc. A small number of specialty lifting equipment manufacturers currently produce hydraulic lifting gantries that utilize hydraulically telescoped legs that are structured much like telescopic crane booms. There are presently no uniform standards that provide guid- ance to the industry for the design and fabrication of such equip- ment. This paper discusses the uses of these gantries, examines cur- rent standards for similar types of lifting equipment, and makes rec- ommendations for design and fabrication. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941803. The analysis and testing of gauge fogging. Leonard H. Cope land, Leonard H. Cope land P.E.; and Stephen E. Nock, Datcon Instrument Co. The fogging of gauge lenses on various heavy duty vehicles has been a problem but the evaluation of various solutions has been an intuitive instead of a quantitative process. This paper details the causes, prevention and testing of the fogging of the lens on air-core gauges (indicating units) covered by SAE J1810. The following three areas are evaluated: internal and external sources of moisture and heat that can cause gauge lens fogging, gauge and vehicle design improvements and tests to rank alternate gauge designs for resistance to lens fogging. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941804. Teleoperation and autonomous guidance systems for off-road vehicles. Jussi Mononen, Turo Nieminen, and Jarmo Puputti, Modulaire Inc. An all-hydraulic, track-driven vehicle with both remote control and autonomous operation capabilities was designed. The paltform vehicle features fully hydrostatic drive with a vari- able displacement pump and hub motor for each track. The combi- nation of hydrostatic drive and tracks offers excellent controllability for autonomous applications as well as good maneuverability and traction. The remote control system allows the user to operate both the vehicle and various payloads, including robotic manipulators and surveillance equipment. The teleoperation (video-assisted remote control) has the same basic functionality, but allows the operator to be beyond visual range from the vehicle. The autonomous control system includes an easy-to-use man- machine interface and mission planning module, precise position- ing, and autonomous controls for both the vehicle and the payload. The system design is modular and adaptable. Portions of the autono- mous control technology can be used in conjunction with teleopera- tion for semi-autonomous use. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 941805. Small engine combustion chamber optimization using an ionization probe head gasket. Robert W. Burrahm and John T. Kubesh, Southwest Research Institute. Small utility engines have been targeted with new exhaust emis- sions regulations by both the United States Environmental Protec- tion Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). CARB emissions standards are already in place, while EPA is still considering legislation. Overhead valve (OHV) engines and those near the upper end of the power limit for small engines, 18.6 kW (25 horsepower), will be able to meet these new regulations much easier than the lower power engines and those of side valve design. Side valve, or L-head engines, have relatively higher emis- sions levels and will require a greater effort to meet regulations. One of the reasons that L-head engines produce higher levels of exhaust emissions is due to relatively high combustion chamber sur- face-to-volume ratios compared to OHV engine combustion cham- bers. There are also areas in the combustion chamber that have diffi- culty sustaining a flame front and hence, combustion is quenched before burning all of the fuel/air mixture. This results in high hydro- carbon (HC) production. This work was conducted, using Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) internal research funding, to improve HC emissions by optimizing combustion chamber shape. Tests were performed on a 3 kW (4.0 hp), single-cylinder, air-cooled, L-head gasoline engine using special instrumentation to determing flame front arrival at the edges of the combustion chamber. Exhaust emissions were mea- sured with both the stock and a modified cylinder head at a variety of equivalence ratios to document results. 941806. Measured emissions of small engines under steady state and transient operation. G. J. Brereton, K. Morrison, H. A. Chishty, G. Schwartz, and D. J. Patterson, University of Michigan. The exhaust emissions of off-road and utility engines have recently come under increasingly thorough scrutiny and are now becoming the subject of federal regulations. While the most straight- forward emissions guidelines relate to steady-state engine perfor- mance, it is well known that duty cycles of many small engines have a transient content and that its significance can vary strongly from application to application. Hence, it is important to examine how 222</page><page sequence="222">941806-941811 measured emissions change when the transient content of a test cycle is varied, and what kinds of steady-state and transient test cycles might realistically imitate operational conditions. These questions have been addressed in an experimental study in which several small two- and four-stroke engines have been tested under steady state and transient cycles. The same tests were also carried out when these engines had been adjusted to operate at leaner air- fuel ratios, as might be required by forthcoming regulations. The results of this study reveal some appreciable differences between steady-state and transient emissions of engines, particularly at leaner air-fuel ratios. 941807. Exhaust emission control of small 4-stroke air cooled utility engines an initial R&amp;D report. John J. Mooney and H. Shinn Hwang , Engelhard Corp.; and Keith O. Daby and James R. Winberg, Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp. Environmental concerns and regulations have stimulated the study of applying catalytic emission control to 4-stroke air cooled utility engines of less than 25 Hp. These engines require air/fuel mixtures considerably richer than those of automotive engines, entailing different catalytic solutions. In addition, small utility engines are subjected to a variety of unique operating modes. Factors discussed for this new catalyst system application are space velocity, temperature, test cycle, operating modes, lube oil consumption, engine control systems, engine life, and operating efficiency as well as other factors unique to this engine. An unex- pected effect of this catalyst application, after-ignition of unburned exhaust components in a classical diffusion flame, is also discussed. It appears that catalytic emission control of small 4-stroke utility engines can be effective. However, considerably more work needs to be accomplished before a catalytic system, which is integrated into these utility engines, can achieve the final result - a clean, safe engine fór both the consumer and the environment. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941808. Special diesel generator monitoring. Jeffrey E. Hart and Kenneth A. Kuhar, PECO Energy Co. As the on-site source for emergency AC power, emergency die- sel generators at nuclear power plants receive a great deal of atten- tion from plant staff as well as industry regulators. Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station recently undertook the task of reconstituting the design basis and improving the plant licensing requirements for the emergency diesel generators. Special testing was required to demonstrate that the engines, which have been in service for 20 years, could meet the new operating requirements. Special tests were written to coincide with other plant testing where possible, to minimize impact on emergency diesel generator availability. Test data was recorded on VHS tape to obtain a true analog representation of the selected signals and to allow collection of all data from one test run. The recorded signals would be played back into a high speed Data Acquisition System (DAS) from which they could be analyzed and configured as necessary in a laboratory environment to reproduce the data. The recorded data can be kept indefinitely to allow reproduction and comparison at a later date as an aid in troubleshooting and monitoring system performance over time. Parameters monitored included generator voltage, watts, VARs, current, frequency, speed, exciter voltage and current, various relay actuations, and air start system pressures and temperatures. The test results show that the engine was not only able to meet the criteria to which it was licensed over 20 years ago, but that new requirements resulting from the enhancements to the plant Techni- cal Specifications would also be met. The engine responses to the transient imposed were very similar to responses of a new diesel generator recently purchased and tested at the manufacturer's facil- ity. The test results increased station confidence in its Emergency Diesel Generators and allowed it to make the licensing changes and commitments that increase the confidence of regulating agencies. This paper will discuss that testing, but more specifically, the special parameter monitoring equipment and techniques utilized for data gathering and analysis. The ability to record data for later con- ditioning and analysis has been the key to the success of the testing. The benefits of analog recording of data for future playback are still being realized by the station. 941809. Qualification (commercial grade dedication) of an aleo 251 diesel engine for nuclear standby service. William H. Goelzer, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.; Edwin C. Walters , TENERA Corp.; and U sama A. Farradj, VECTRA Technologies, Inc. This paper discusses the process used for dedicating an Aleo 18- 251 -F commercial diesel engine for nuclear standby service at Pacific Gas and Electric' s Diablo Canyon Power Plant. Completed in 1993, this project was the first commercial grade dedication of a complete diesel generator system under the guidance of the Elec- tric Power Research Institutes (EPRI), "Guidelines for the Utiliza- tion of Commercial Grade Items in Nuclear Safety Related Applica- tions (NCIG-07)". All four dedication methods outlined in the guideline were used in this effort, including Special Tests and Inspections, Commercial Grade Survey of Suppliers, Source Verifi- cation and Acceptable Supplier/Item Performance Record. The complexity of the dedication effort resulted in extensive review and inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Resolv- ing NRC concerns required significant on-site testing (including a 200-hour run of the diesel) using a load bank capable of simulating both resistive and reactive generator loads. In addition, an extensive inspection of the diesel including removal of several power assem- blies (cylinder heads, pistons and connecting rods) was required to ensure that the unit did not experience any excessive wear or prema- ture failure of components during the 200-hour run. Engine operat- ing parameters were monitored and analyzed to further ensure that the engine operated properly. The dedication effort resulted in satisfactory completion of the required start-up and post-modification testing within the available refueling outage schedule window. Details of the commercial grade dedication approach, testing, and inspection requirements are pres- ented. 941810. A results oriented maintenance approach for nuclear emergency diesel generators. R. G. Billig and A. D. Gillette, Coo- per Industries. Recent emphasis on increasing the availability of nuclear emer- gency diesel generators (EDG's) has motivated the industry to re- evaluate the maintenance philosophies utilized for these units. Improving availability, while maintaining or enhancing the existing levels of reliability, has become the challenge to nuclear utilities. In order to meet quantified and availability objectives, a renewed approach to maintenance is required. The direction taken includes the initiation of a diagnostic data monitoring and trending program to assess those parameters where such methods have proven to be effective. In addition, prescribed inspections based on historical findings are recommended where needed. Periodic reviews are pro- posed to provide further program improvement. 941811. Root cause investigation of cracked cylinder liners in ALCO 251 diesel engines in nuclear standby service. Christian L. Haller and Robert N. Coward, M PR Associates, Inc.; and Dami- ano LaMastra, Public Service Electric and Gas. This paper describes the root cause investigation of cracking in cylinder liners installed in ALCO 251 diesel engines in nuclear standby service. The results of the investigation identify conditions which contribute to cracking of the upper cylinder liner flange. It is demonstrated that the cracks are initiated via high cycle fatigue, but that most cracks will arrest. A cylinder liner with an arrested crack of this type would be expected to continue to provide reliabile service. For worst case conditions, low-cycle thermal fatigue may cause crack growth to continue beyond the normal arrest point, ulti- mately causing catastrophic failure of the cylinder liner flange. Sev- 223</page><page sequence="223">941811-941834 eral corrective actions are applicable to all operators of ALCO 25 1 diesel engines. The root cause investigation included finite element stress analyses and fracture mechanics analyses of the cylinder liner and a detailed review of industry experience. Results in each of these areas are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941812. Natural gas engines for hybrid vehicle systems. Richard Mastronardi and Edward Doyle, Thermo Power Corp. Tecogen Division, Thermo Power Corporation, has vast experi- ence using automotive derivative natural gas and propane engines in both stationary and vehicular applications. These lower cost engines have been modified internally to take advantage of these higher octane fuels and to demonstrate equivalent durability and reliability when compared to industrial grade engines which cost significantly more. This paper will show some of Tecogen' s experi- ence in using these engines, including their use in hybrid vehicles as a range extender. We will also discuss how the waste heat off the engines can be used efficiently for heating and air conditioning of hybrid vehicles. Emphasis will be on the engine as part of an effec- tive hybrid vehicle system. 941814. FEA software advances SPUR use of tool directly by design engineers. Khosrow Nematollahi, Modern Computer Aided Engineering, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to update the reader on the new trends in computer aided engineering. It covers modern technologies in the human interface, solver technologies as well as new element formulations to simplify the finite element analysis for design engi- neers. A finite element system based on microsoft windows user interface as well as network architecture is also presented. 941815. Off-highway vehicle ride comfort analysis. Wen L. Li and Gopi Somayajula, Case Corp. The cab vibration and ride comfort of off-highway vehicles were analyzed using a multi-body system dynamics model that consists of cab and four isolation mounts. The vibrational power spectral density (PSD) data measured on four mounting brackets was used as excitation input to the model to represent real-world situations. As specified in the SAE and ISO recommendations, a weighted rms acceleration was used as a measure of ride comfort or human per- ception of vibration severity of vehicles. The analytically predicted results have shown excellent agreement to the measured data. Design optimization process or sensitivity analysis was demon- strated to investigate the effects on vehicle ride quality of isolation mount characteristics (axial and radial stiffness) and mounting con- figuration (mount location and orientation). It was found that, for certain field operating cases, a very significant improvement in ride performance could be achieved by properly specifying mount stiff- ness and mounting configuration. 941830. (P-286) CNC duct riveting work cell. Thomas E. Endres, Process Equipment Co. The CNC controlled automatic riveting work cell represents the latest state-of-the-art in automatic fastening machines and support hardware. The work cell contains a unique designed knee type drill and rivet machine that has a sixty inch throat depth, four position upper head and sixteen thousand pounds of upset force. The machine is equipped with dual drill spindles, one for drilling and one for deburring. The knee style machine was developed for fabricating tubular assemblies which are fed into the throat of the machine over an eight inch square lower knee. A CNC controlled four axis posi- tion system presents the part to the machine for riveting. Support systems include an automatic fastener feed system and a vacuum chip collection system. The work cell is controlled by an Allen Bradley series 9/290 enhanced CNC processor. The paper presents each individual system and it's role as part of the total CNC duct riveting work cell. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941832. (P-286) Automatic stringer drilling system (ASDS). Richard Calawa, Michael Assadi, and John Hartmann, Electroim- pact, Inc.; and James Culpepper, Northrop Grumman Corp. Northrop Corp. manufactures body panels for the Boeing 747 air- craft. There are 1,259 different stringer configurations used on the three 747 models with an average of 839 stringers per ship set. Until recently, all drain holes and skin coordination pilot holes were drilled manually using plastic application template tools (PATTS). Inventory costs were high and manual drilling errors led to exces- sive scrap and rework rates. Northrop engineers recognized that automating the stringer drilling process would produce higher qual- ity parts at a lower cost. Northrop worked with Electroimpact, Inc. to develop the Auto- matic Stringer Drilling System (ASDS). The ASDS automatically clamps and drills all straight and contoured stringers used on the 747. Stringers are mounted on a rotating platform that provides +/- 90o of motion. Two servo-servo drills are mounted on a cantilevered arm with 25 feet of X-axis travel. An infra-red linear encoder main- tains the X-axis accuracy within +/-0.002' over the 25 foot work- zone.

(P-286) Advanced design fatigue resistant rivetless nut plate system. Len Reid and Eric Easterbrook, Fatigue Technol- ogy, Inc. This paper discusses an advanced design rivetless nut plate sys- tem which overcomes the inherent problems associated with typical riveted and rivetless nut plate configuration used in blind assembly or aerospace structures. The Force TecTM (FtCxTM) rivetless nut plate system presented utilizes hole cold expansion technology to radially expand a nut retainer into the fastener hole. Torque and push-out resistance are achieved by the resultant high interference fit of the retainer. Resid- ual compressive stresses induced in the metal surrounding the hole during cold expansion and the reduction in applied cyclic stress range, caused by the high interference fitted retainer, significantly improve resistance to fatigue cracking. This system significantly reduces the high stress concentration associated with other methods and has demonstrated superior nut plate qualities with fast, consis- tent and reliable installation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941834. (P-286) Robotic drilling and milling of composite/ metallic inboard flaps on the Boeing 111 Program. Ronald A. Westberg, Grumman Aerospace and Electronics. This paper reviews the steps followed in evaluating and selecting the "right" automated assembly approach for the drilling and mill- ing of flap (or wing type) composite assembly structure. We formed a task team led by our New York Manufacturing Technology Operations to propose and review all feasible approaches. After evaluating and selecting an approach, an ROI for justification of an automated second stage assembly cell was pre- pared and subsequently approved by management. The team then prepared the user and purchase specifications for bidding. A gantry robot system was chosen and purchased in 1992 from Cimcorp (PaR Systems). It was installed in the Grumman Stu- art Florida facility in 1993. Now, one year after starting production of the 777 inboard flaps, we are evaluating the process. This paper emphasizes the importance of preparing a thorough specification and recognizes acceptance tests and training as being key elements in a successful implementation. The approach taken exemplifies the fact that today, automated assembly equipment, controlled by extensive software, is available with capabilities that were not possible only a few years ago. This improvement in assem- bly technology saves assembly time, lessens the amount of rework, 224</page><page sequence="224">941834-941840 and decreases the time required to get a new operation successfully up and running. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941835.

The goal of this paper is to present an innovative yet practical approach to automated aircraft assembly which meets the evolving aerospace industry requirements for flexibility and modularity. Adaptive Robotized Multifunction Assembly cell - ARMA is then described in two different vantage points: -as a concept: a descriptive of the philosophy which led to the development of auto- mated assembly cells is offered; -as a practical solution: a descrip- tion of the modular hardware and the powerful information process- ing system that supports the individual cells is provided. The configuration which results in the most productive and effec- tive cell while keeping the cost of equipment as low as possible is described. The ability of the cell to adapt to new requirements, as they evolve, is also described. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941836. (P-286) Gantry 5 axis DNC/CNC high speed milling and drilling machine with integrated multiflexible universal holding fixture for the aerospace industry. Juan Solano, M. Tor- res Disenos Ind.; and Ed Bella, Manca, Inc. An airplane fuselage structure basically consists of many individ- ual fuselage panels which differ considerably in size and shape. Each individual panel is automatically assembled from individual components, such as the panels, frames, stringers, clips, shear ties, window frames, etc. In order to automatically assemble the fuselage panel, it is neces- sary to produce ready-to-match structural components, manufac- tured to drawing by numerically controlled machines. For the net trimming and drilling of locator holes at fuselage pan- els, a gantry DNC/CNC high speed milling and drilling machine series with the integrated multiflexible Universal Holding Fixture has been specially designed. By integrating the multiflexible hold- ing fixture, the system provides the highest grade of flexibility and reduces changeover time from one workpiece configuration to another to 2 minutes or less, thus eliminating a large number of expensive dedicated holding fixtures. The panels are held rigidly in position by vacuum. All support rods with vacuum cups move in the X-/Y-/Z-directions simultaneously; the support rods are automati- cally locked after reaching their final positions. Programming takes place via user-friendly PC-software. Standard vacuum cups are offered in various sizes with tilting capability of up to 45o. During the machining process, all holding points are monitored by vacuum sensors and are displayed on the monitor of the control system. The multiflexible holding fixture is controlled by its own controller and operates independently from the gantry machine. Universal holding fixtures are designed by applying a well- proven modular concept and therefore are available in different design configurations in any size to be integrated/interfaced to exist- ing machines. Applications of the system include the machining of, e.g.: - flat and compound-contoured fuselage panels; -wing skins; - compos- ite structures; -honeycomb components; -frames/chords; - string- ers. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941837. (P-286) Automatic riveting cell for commercial air- plane floor grid assembly. Nigel R. Roche, Deutsche Aerospace Airbus GmbH. With the introduction of the A330/A340 widebody program into the Airbus manufacturing process during the summer of 1990, it was found necessary to evaluate the situation regarding the production of the Airbus Wide-Body floor grids. Due to the various options or type deviations, the number of different floor structures reached almost 38. To build individual production jigs or fixtures for all of these floor grids would have taken toll on a large amount of factory floor space. The decision was made to establish and build a ' 'Floor Grid Structure Assembly Cell." This cell mainly comprises of: -6 transportable multi-tooling fixtures for the various floor grids in the Airbus Wide-Body sections 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18; -a magazine for the storage of the above mentioned fixtures; -an overhead crane for fixture transportation in both semi and full automatic modes; -manual manufacturing sta- tions number I and III; -robotic drill/riveting station II; -control center. The manufacturing in station I and III is done manually, whereas in station II - the riveting station - the operations are totally auto- matic. The main feature of this station II is a 5 axis travelling col- umn robot with its various automatically changeable end effectors. These end effectors are Cherry Buck riveting machines as well as drilling machines. The riveting machines are weighing in up to 350 kgs, they drill, inject sealant, install and close the rivets in an auto- matic sequence. The positioner traverses 11 meters in X and 5.1 meters in Y carrying the end effectors within a stipulated tolerance. This paper will deal with this very successful production cell, emphasizing the automatic drill/riveting station II. It will not cover the necessary material/component logistics or the data transfer down loading. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941838. (P-286) Drivmatic retrofit - Northrop Grumman Corp. Michael Latimer, Northrop Grumman Corp. Fuselage panels for the Boeing 747 aircraft have been assembled at the Northrop Commercial Aircraft Division Alameda (D2) facil- ity since the mid 1960s. The assembly work has been accomplished using Gemcor CNC Drivmatic systems. These systems have per- formed reliably since their initial installation in the late 1960s, but have recently begun to show their age. In 1992, the decision was made to establish a project that would direct the retrofit of these systems to state-of-the- practice condition. This paper will discuss the planning, scheduling and specifica- tion development for that project. 941839. (P-286) Automatic fastening of space vehicle sub- assemblies. Oscar B. Stiles, Martin Marietta; and James E. Clifton, General Dynamics/Convair. Space launch vehicles offer some unique challenges to automatic riveting. In most cases the assemblies are only used once and have one chance to perform. This requires a high degree of reliability for each assembly. The equipment used must be capable of producing high quality fastener installations. The automatic riveting machine used at the Harlingen Facility of Martin-Marietta Aeronautics Group meets this challenge. This paper describes the equipment, tooling, and controller used to automatically fasten the subassemblies of the Payload Fairing (lower cone and cylinder), Interstage Adapter and Thrust Cylinder of the Atlas/Centaur space vehicle. It will discuss the unique fea- tures of the automatic riveting machine and the tooling required to fasten the individual subassemblies. It will discuss the tooling requirements for the individual subassemblies and their part posi- tioner requirements. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941840.

This paper describes the development, implementation, and ben- efits of a real-time statistical process control (SPC) data acquisition and response system. The system has been installed on four produc- tion CNC riveters and provides enhanced, in-process control of automated fastening machine performance. 225</page><page sequence="225">941840-941848 Each system employs commercially available SPC components. These components, coupled with real-time data acquisition comput- ers, have been integrated with the riveter's controllers and sensors to detect process anomalies as they occur. Real-time knowledge of fastening machine performance is the benefit of this system's approach to SPC. Fastener quality is ensured during the fastening cycle, not after sequences (and perhaps hun- dreds of rivets) have been completed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941841. (P-286) Assessment of installation and inspection methodologies of taperlok, sleeve bolt, and straight shank bolts and their impacts on production and efficiency. Mahboob Alam, McDonnell Douglas. Assembly in the aerospace industry is generally a tedious and labor intensive process. Recently, the industry has begun a signifi- cant effort to improve assembly operations by integrating efficient design, optimized fasteners, tooling consistency, and advanced man- ufacturing technologies. The improved assembly methodologies are key factors in significantly improving productivity and cost. For a long period, the tapered or sleeve bolt has been the standard fastening hardware for certain areas of wing box assembly and wing to center box (in some cases to fuselage with integral center box) join. Recently straight shank bolts have successfully been applied in the wing build-up and wing to wing join of a large transport air- craft. This paper will highlight the installation methodologies/ processes and inspection requirements of the above mentioned fas- teners and their impacts on productivity and cost. 941842. (P-286) Automated rivet interference inspection sys- tem. Larry Hazlehurst and Mark Woods, Boeing Commercial Air- plane. The Automated Rivet Interference Inspection System (ARIIS) has been developed by Boeing to replace the traditional time con- suming, operator dependent methods of measuring rivet interference by hand. The new ARES method utilizes a laser micrometer and a precision stepper motor/bench center that are integrated with a PC. Studies show a reduction in measurement variation by a factor of four to five when comparing the ARIIS system to traditional blade micrometer hand methods. The ARIIS system provides built in Statistical Process Control (SPC) for machines that install fluid tight fatigue rated rivets. This is accomplished by automatically keeping records on each inspected fastener. The system on command will generate X bar and R charts, as well as other SPC data on button height, button width, and all interference characteristics over time. Also all pertinent tooling, structure, materials, and aircraft information is automatically recorded for tracking. The system has been used to track machine performance over time by recording rivet installation trends. In addition to supporting production cycles, the ARIIS system is extensively utilized as a tool for process research and development. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941843.

During design of the 111 Airplane, light gage, near net section 2090-T86 extrusions were considered to reduce aircraft weight. The need to evaluate effects of fastener installation on 2090-T86 was indicated by a previous study documenting problems due to low short transverse tensile strength. Tests by Boeing installing fasteners into holes using interference fits showed 2090-T86 was more susceptible to damage from fasten- ing than previously reported. Damage consisted of cracks normal to the short transverse direction around the periphery of the fastener hole. This report documents the test program conducted at Boeing. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941845. (P-286) Planer deformation measurement: Deter- mining slug rivet expansion by dimensional external examina- tion. Philip S. Lankford, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. A non-destructive dimensional test shows promise in assessing the presence and degree of rivet expansion that occurs in aircraft structures assembled with slug rivets. The method relies upon mea- suring the height of the surface mound that surrounds the periphery of the installed rivet. Manufacturers typically rely on destructive examination of test coupons representative of manufactured products. Such tests are conducted prior to the start of production, as well as intermittently during production. The dimensional test, applied to the actual product, could replace the intermittent (in-process) coupon tests. The test method could provide valuable process control data while lowering manufacturing costs. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941846. (P-286) One step precision drilling and countersink- ing of composites. Werner Ponitzsch, Dornie r Luftfahrt GmbH; Martin Hanke, High-System-Technik GmbH; and George Bartosch, INTECH Corp. Precision drilling and countersinking in composites presents new challenges in aircraft assembly. A new self feeding drilling system has been developed to drill superior hole and countersink quality and offer substantial savings in composite assembly. The HP-Drilling system includes a drill motor with integrated vacuum, simplified and less costly template design and drill bits for CFRP and Aluminium stack-ups lasting 800 to 3000 holes. The automatic drilling feeder with an adapter is inserted manually into the drilling template bushing. After activating the starter button the drilling unit is locked in the template. A hollow piston compresses the components together before the drill bit advances with adjust- able feed rate to drill the hole and countersink in one step. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 941847.

A robotic drill gantry has been established to automate the pro- cess of drilling, coldworking, reaming and countersinking combined skins and structure during new manufacture of F5 wings. The gantry accurately produces high quality holes and exact depth countersinks providing for superior fastener fits and skin aerodynamic smooth- ness. Two primary end effectors are used; one for drill, ream and countersink operations, and the other for split mandrel coldworking.

This study, lead by Elf Aquitaine for several years, shows the possibility to use ETBE instead of MTBE as a gasoline component and compares properties of these two ethers regarding different parameters like octanes, volatility, engine cleanliness, stability of the ethers themselves and of gasoline blends, lubricant compatibility and toxicological data. ETBE appears at least as good as MTBE and sometimes better, as ETBE is chemically more similar to hydrocarbons than MYBE and can be used advantageously as a gasoline oxygenated compo- nent. 941861. The effects of fuel evaporation on the octane number of methanol gasoline blended fuels. Derek P. Moran, University of Cape Town; Princeton Univ. A procedure is described to estimate the influence of end-gas temperature on Octane Number. Blending methanol with gasoline is known to cause a disproportionate increase in Research Octane Number, and this is found to correlate well with the evaporative cooling characteristics of these blends. The Motor Octane Number test eliminates evaporative effects, and the difference between the two test methods is evaluated in terms of evaporative cooling. It is concluded that the high heat of vaporization of methanol is largely responsible for the excellent RON performance of methanol- gasoline blended fuels. 941862. (SP- 1054) The effect of unleaded gasoline formula- tion on antiknock performance. Federico Millo, Carlo Vincenzo Ferraro, and Mario Rocco Marzano, Dipartimento di Energetica Politecnico di Torino; and Edoardo Barbera, FIAT Auto S.P.A. The knock behavior of two groups of unleaded gasolines, each of which includes three fuels with different chemical compositions but comparable standard octane numbers, has been analyzed using a mass-produced engine. The aim of the work was to point out possible inconsistencies between the standard octane numbers of the fuels and their knock behavior in mass-produced engines. The fuels of the first group had R.O.N. s and M.O.N. s very close to the minimum values required by European Community regula- tions (95 and 85, respectively., whereas the fuels of the second group had higher R.O.N.s and M.O.N. s (about 100 and 87.5, respec- tively). One of the tested fuels in the first group was a typical European unleaded gasoline, the other gasolines had higher olefin or aromatic contents. An increase of the aromatic content has not shown appre- ciable differences between the expected knock behavior of the fuel from its standard octane numbers, and its performance on the mass- produced engine. On the contrary, a higher olefin content has revealed a remarkable difference. The second group was made up of gasolines obtained by mixing base fuels, similar to typical European unleaded gasoline, with MTBE, methanol and ethanol. Only MTBE has shown quite a good correspondence between the predicted and actual behavior, while alcohols, despite quite a good correlation at low speed, have revealed discrepancies in the medium and high speed range. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941863. (SP- 1054) The influence of high-octane fuel blends on the performance of a two-stroke si engine with knock-limited- compression ratio. Rames h B. Poola, Ar gonne National Lab.; and T. Bhasker, B. Nagalingam, and K. V. Gopalakrishnan, Indian Insti- tute of Technology. The use of alcohol-gasoline blends enables the favorable features of alcohols to be utilized in spark ignition (SI) engines while avoid- ing the shortcomings of their application as straight fuels. Eucalyp- tus and orange oils possess high octane values and are also good potential alternative fuels for SI engines. The high octane value of these fuels can enhance the octane value of the fuel when it is blended with low-octane gasoline. In the present work, 20 percent by volume of orange oil, eucalyptus oil, methanol and ethanol were blended separately with gasoline, and the performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics were evaluated at two different compression ratios. The phase separation problems arising from the alcohol-gasoline blends were minimized by adding eucalyptus oil as a co-solvent. Test results indicate that the compression ratio can be raised from 7.4 to 9 without any detrimental effect, due to the higher octane rating of the fuel blends. Knock- limited mazimum brake output also increases due to extension of the knock limit. The knock limit is extended by methanol- eucalyptus-ethanol-orange oil blends, in descending order. 941864. (SP- 1054) Correlation between the liquid fuel prop- erties density, viscosity and surface tension and the drop sizes produced by an si engine pintle-type port fuel injector. Paul Wil- liams, University College London; and Paul Beckwith , BP Oil Tech- nology Center. Droplet size measurements were performed on the spray from a pintle-type gasoline injector. These quantified the influence of the fuel properties, relative fuel/air velocity and manifold air density upon the droplet sizes. Dimensional analysis and knowledge of the atomization process was used to derive equations predicting mean droplet diameters. Constants and exponents used in these equations were evaluated by correlation with the measured data. The equations were used to predict the individual or combined influence of the above variables. It is concluded that the influence of variations in properties between production gasolines on atomization is likely to be small. 941865.

Paul Williams, University College London; aņd Paul Beckwith, BP Oil Technology Center. The performance of a pintle-type gasoline injector has been stud- ied. Observations performed on test rigs and running engines sug- gest that under conditions of low manifold pressure a 'pencil- jet' formation may replace the well atomized spray normally produced by the injector. Importantly, this phenomenon was not observed when using substitute fuels such as n-heptane. 227</page><page sequence="227">941865-941870 It is concluded that both the mechanical design of the injector and the combination of the liquid properties density, viscosity and sur- face tension influence the ability of a given injector to produce a well atomized spray at low manifold pressures. The paper discusses measures to prevent pencil-jet formation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941866. (SP- 1054) Effect of gasoline composition on exhaust hydrocarbon. At sushi Käme oka, Ken-ichi Akiyama, and Kenzo Hosoi, Japan Automobile Research Institute, Inc. Numerous studies have been conducted on the effect of gasoline composition on automobile exhaust hydrocarbons, in order to improve the air quality and reduce the impact on the environment. However, the quantitative relationship between gasoline composi- tion and exhaust hydrocarbon has not been clarified. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of individual hydrocar- bons in gasoline and to clarify the effect of the gasoline composition on engine-out exhaust hydrocarbons. Experiments were performed on a single cylinder research engine operating under steady state condition, The test fuels were blended gasolines of alkylate, cata- lytic reformate and fluid catalytic cracking gasoline. Chemically defined binary fuel mixtures of iso-octane, benzene, toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene were used as variables to study their impact on exhaust hydrocarbons. The individual exhaust hydrocarbon species were analyzed using a gas Chromatograph with flame ionization detector (FID). The results of tests with blended gasoline indicated that the exhaust hydrocarbons were classified into the unburned fuel and the cracked products such as methane, ethane and various ole- fins. The unburned fuel of over C4 paraffins and aromatics in the exhaust was proportional to each component. The regression analy- sis between fuel and exhaust hydrocarbons yielded the following results. The percentage of individual hydrocarbon in THC was expressed as a function of paraffin, olefin and aromatic contents in fuel. The "production coefficient' ' defined as the proportional cons- tant was obtained. The production coefficient is one of the measures quantitatively relating the individual exhaust hydrocarbon to the gasoline composition. The production coefficients of benzene were 5% for toluene, 4% for xylene and 8% for ethyl benzene. These val- ues suggested that alkyl-benzene in the fuel produced benzene in the exhaust. 941867. (SP- 1054) The effect of gasoline composition on exhaust emissions from modern bmw vehicles. W. W. Lange, Deutsche Shell AG; J. S. McArragher, Shell International Petro- leum Co.; and A. Müller and V. Schäfer, BMW AG. In a cooperative program between BMW and Shell, the effects of gasoline properties and composition on regulated emissions (HC, CO, NOx), CO2 fuel consumption and catalyst performance have been studied. The objective of the test program was to investigate the effect of different hydrocarbon groups from typical refinery streams on exhaust emissions with a detailed analysis not only of the tailpipe emissions but also engine out emissions and catalyst per- formance. In total thirteen fuels with widely varying physical prop- erties and chemical composition were evaluated in a 1991 series production BMW 525i, and a subset of three of these fuels in two other BMW models to verify their sensitivity to fuel quality. The results for the BMW 525i showed that significant reductions in HC, CO, and NOx emissions were seen for fuels containing splash blended oxygenates and with aromatics replaced by iso-paraffins. Similar reductions in HC and CO emissions were seen in the other two vehicles, although the BMW 3 1 6i was somewhat less sensitive to fuel changes. It is not clear whether these reductions were due to chemical composition (i.e. MTBE and aromatics) or to associated changes in physical properties (i.e. fuel volatility). This important question will be addressed in the forthcoming European EPEFE pro- gram (European Program on Emissions Fuels and Engine Technolo- gies). The effect of fuel quality on NOx emissions varied for the dif- ferent vehicles. The MTBE-containing, high volatility, low aromatic fuel reduced emissions from the BMW 525i, had negligible effect on the BMW 316i but increased emissions from the BMW 740i. These varying effects can be explained in terms of specific engine/ catalyst/lambda effects. The fuel effects were shown to be partly due to changes in engine-out emissions, but more to changes in catalyst efficiency, especially over the EUDC part of the test cycle where emission rates are relatively low, but the greatest relative fuel effects were seen. Catalyst rig tests with varying fuel sulphur content between 10 and 100 ppm showed no significant effect on the conversion effi- ciency of the current platinum/rhodium catalyst. However a proto- type palladium based catalyst showed greater sensitivity to fuel sul- phur. Chassis dynamometer tests on the BMW 525i with platinum/ rhodium catalyst showed a reduction in NOx emissions when reduc- ing fuel sulphur, but CO and HC emissions were unaffected. The MTBE containing, volatile, low aromatics fuels gave small reductions in CO2 emissions within the repeatability of the experi- ment, but showed significant increases in volumetric fuel consump- tion. 941868. (SP- 1054) The effect of gasoline composition on stoi- chiometry and exhaust emissions. C. R. McDonald, Shell Research Ltd.; P. R. Shore, Ricardo Consulting Engineers; G. R. Lee and G. J. den Otter, Shell Research Ltd.; and D. T. Humphries, Ricardo Consulting Engineers. Six full range gasolines were tested in two engines (one with a catalyst) operated at 4 steady states. Engine-out regulated emissions responded to equivalence ratio, O, in the accepted manner. For both CO and NOx, there was a characteristic, single emissions response to changes in O. Changing fuel composition will primarily alter the production of these emissions by modifying the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, proj- ecting engine operation onto another part of the O response curve. These 4&gt; effects, which are independent of engine design, also deter- mine how operating conditions affect engine-out CO and NOx. Speciated hydrocarbon measurements at engine-out and tail-pipe confirm results seen in previous test-cycle based programs. 941869. (SP- 1054) NO* aromatics effects in catalyst-equipped gasoline vehicles. A. LeJeune, C. R. McDonald, and G. R. Lee, Shell Research Ltd. Investigations into fuel compositional effects on emissions using model and full range fuels suggest aromatic components promote NOx conversion over the catalyst. Steady state results derived from a single engine (Ricardo Gaso- line Fuels Consortium data) show that at a typical part load condi- tion, the catalyst removes NOx less effectively with lower aromatic fuels. Neither CO nor H2 contribute significantly to catalyst perfor- mance. Two vehicles were tested over a European cycle. Toluence for- mes more combustion chamber NOx, offset by increased catalyst conversion efficiency giving lower tailpipe NOx than iso-octane in the vehicle with the better catalyst light-off and AFR control. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941870. (SP- 1054) Simultaneous measurements of drivea- bility and emissions at cool ambient temperatures. Scott W. Jor- gensen and Jack D. Benson, GM NAO Research and Development Center. Simultaneous measurements of cold-start/warm-up driveability and tailpipe emissions on a chassis dynamometer were made at 5°C using four late-model vehicles. Two fuels were used: a low drivea- bility index (DI) fuel containing 11% MTBE and 29% aromatics, and a high DI fuel with no MTBE and 43% aromatics. Tailpipe hydrocarbon emissions and total weighted driveability demerits (TWDs) both correlated with the fuel used: both increased signifi- cantly when high-DI / no-MTBE fuel was used. A strong linear rela- tion exists between TWDs and simultaneously measured tailpipe hydrocarbon emissions. Co and NOx emissions did not correlate with fuel composition. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 228</page><page sequence="228">941871-941876 941871. Multidimensional port-and-in-cylinder flow calcula- tions and flow visualization study in an internal combustion engine with different intake configurations. Bahram Khalighi, Daniel C. Haworth, and Mark S. Hue bier, General Motors Research and Development Center. Multidimensional simulations of coupled intake port/valve and in-cylinder flow structures in a pancake-shape combustion chamber engine are reported. The engine calculations include moving piston, moving intake valve, and valve stem. Direct comparisons of three intake configurations for the same cylinder geometry are presented: (1) standard intake valve; (2) intake valve with high-swirl should orientation: and (3) intake valve with across- head shroud orienta- tion. In order to verify the calculated results, qualitative flow visual- ization experiments were carried out for the same intake geometries during the induction process using a transient water analog. During the intake process the results of the multidimensional simulation agreed very well with the qualitative flow visualization experiments. An important finding in this study is that the standard intake valve configuration (no shroud) generates a well-defined tumbling flow structure at BDC which is sustained and amplified by the compres- sion process and, in turn, causes generation of a high turbulence level before TDC. A comparison between tumble ratios at BDC indicated that in-cylinder tumble was highest for the standard valve intake configuration and lowest for the across- head shroud orienta- tion. Both the standard and high swirl shroud orientation produced the same levels of turbulence during late compression with the across-head shroud orientation being about 30% less. Many interest- ing features of the in-cylinder flow structures as well as differences between tumble, swirl and the local velocity and turbulence at the spark plug location for all three cases are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941872. Liquid gasoline behavior in the engine cylinder of a si engine. Younggy Shin, Wai K. Cheng, and John B. Heywood, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The videos were taken with the engine firing under cold conditions in a simulated start-up pro- cess, at 1,000 RPM and intake manifold pressure of 0.5 bar. The variables examined were the injector geometry, injector type (nor- mal and air-assisted), injection timing (open- and closed-valve injection), and injected air-to-fuel ratios. The visualization results show several important and unexpected features of the in-cylinder fuel behavior: 1 ) strip- atomization of the fuel film by the intake flow; 2) squeezing of fuel film between the intake valve and valve seat at valve closing to form large droplets; 3) deposition of liquid fuel as films distributed on the intake valve and head region. Some of the liquid fuel survives combustion into the next cycle. The time evolution of the in-cylinder liquid film is influenced by the injection geometry, injection timing, injected air- to-fuel ratio, and port surface temperature. Photographs showing the liquid fuel features and an explanation of the observed phenomena are given in the paper. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941873. An experimental and analytical investigation of the spray structure from automotive port injectors. Ming-Chia Lai, Fu-Quan Zhao, Amer Ahmad Amer, and Tsan-Hai Chue, Wayne State Univ. Port fuel injection system in gasoline engines is receiving an increasing attention for its potential advantages in meeting the con- strains of simultaneous reduction in fuel consumption and exhaust emission, and maintaining a good engine performance. The struc- ture of port injector spray dominates the mixture preparation process and strongly affect the subsequent engine combustion characteris- tics over a wide range of operating conditions in port-injection gaso- line engines. In this paper, an experimental and analytical study is made to characterize the breakup mechanism and atomization pro- cess of the non-air-assisted port injector sprays in gasoline engines. The liquid sprays resulted ffrom various types of current and devel- opment-type automotive fuel injectors were visualized using planar laser- induced fluorescence imaging technique. A comparison was made on the spray structure of the single hole and multi-hole injec- tors. The radial distributions of the droplet size and velocity and vol- ume flux were characterized by a PDPA system. Multi- dimensional internal CFD and external spray calculation methods were com- bined to correlate the droplet size, spray angle and several other spray parameters of multi-hole port injectors with the injector design. Through this work, it was found that the multi-hole injector produces a finer spray with a wide spray angle and less dominant liquid phase compared with single hole injector which however, shows a very good pointing ability. Moreover, the turbulent primary breakup mechanism, rather than the aerodynamic secondary one is identified to dominate atomization process of sprays for the low- pressure multi-hole injectors. By correlating to the internal CFD cal- culation result with an injection velocity distribution and an initial disturbance level directly linked to the turbulent energy, the multi- hole compound injector spray is successfully simulated. Therefore, the spray structure can be optimized through the injector design to meet the fundamental requirements of the gasoline engines. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941874. A numerical simulation of intake port phenomena in a spark ignition engine under cold starting conditions. Sergei M. Schurov and Nick Collings, Cambridge Univ. The paper presents a computer simulation of flow and heat trans- fer phenomena in the intake port of a spark ignition engine with port fuel injection, engine cold starting conditions are studied including the effects of in-cylinder mixture back flow into the port. One dimensional air flow and wall fuel film flow models and a two dimensional fuel droplet flow model have been developed using a combination of finite difference approaches. As a result, predictions are obtained that provide detailed picture of the air-fuel mixture properties along the intake port. The model may be of special importance for exhaust gas ignition system simulation as it will provide data concerning mixture forma- tion under conditions of excessive fuel injection during engine start-up. The calculations performed are shown to be phenomenologically correct. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941876. A study of air-assisted fuel injection into a cylinder. S. Das and J. C. Dent, Loughborough University of Technology. The CFD code KIVA has been applied to the simulation of the transient air-assisted fuel injection (AAFI) process, in which air and fuel at moderate pressures are mixed in an interior chamber of the injector before passing through a pintle valve into air at near ambi- ent pressure in a cylinder. On passage through the pintle valve fuel is atomized. Because of the small dimensions of the flow passages within the injector, a very fine computational grid structure is used to accu- rately resolve the flow behavior. Adopting an axisymmetric grid structure enables symmetry to be exploited. The computational results are validated with experimental data for fuel jet penetration and spread with time, obtained using Schlie- ren visualization. The simulation of sir blast atomization is an engine cannot utilize the fine grid structure above because of the large computational resources required. To overcome this problem, the atomization pro- cess at the annular pintle is modeled using fuel injection capabilities within the KIVA and KIVA-II codes. By maintaining mass and momentum conservation at the pintle exit, between the original KIVA prescription and that described above, an approximation to the accurately modeled injection process is obtained. This enables a relatively coarse three dimensional Cartesian grid system used in modeling an engine cylinder to be employed. 229</page><page sequence="229">941876-941883 The agreement between modeled and experimental results are quite acceptable. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941877. A species-based multi-component volatility model for gasoline. Kuo Chiang Chen, Koen De Witte, and Wai K. Cheng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A fuel volatility model based on the major species present in the fuel has been formulated. The model accurately predicts the ASTM distillation curves and Reid Vapor Pressure for hydrocarbon fuels, the model may be used to assess the fuel effects on the extent of evaporation and the vapor composition in the mixture preparation process. 941878. An approach to charge stratification in lean-burn, spark- ignition engines. C. Arcoumanis, D. R. Hull, and J. H. Whi- telaw, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. A constant-volume combustion chamber was used to examine injection of a small quantity of slightly rich fuel/air mixture towards the spark plug around the time of ignition, in an overall very lean mixture rotating at velocities representative of modern spark- ignition engines. The results show that it is possible to achieve 100% ignitability with overall air-fuel ratios in excess of 50 and much faster burn rates than those with initially homogenous mixtures of the same equivalence ratio with high swirl and turbulence. The advantages of this method of local charge stratification have been demonstrated in terms of both pressure measurements and shadow- graphs of the early flame development while the transient character- istics of the injected rich mixture at the spark plug gap were moni- tored by a fast flame ionization detector. The implications of the proposed method for extending the lean limit of premixed fuel-air mixtures in spark-ignition engines are discussed and suggestions are made for its implementation in four-valve gasoline engines. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941879. A numerical and experimental study of intake sys- tem fuel evaporation of methanol-gasoline blended fuels. Derek P. Moran, University of Cape Town; Princeton Univ. A computer model of fuel evaporation in an idealized intake sys- tem is used to study the effect of engine speed on air-fuel mixture temperatures. The model allows for multi-component fuels present both as entrained droplets and wall films. Data are presented show- ing the relative importance of a range of parameters including: fuel composition, air speed, and droplet size and distribution. Computer predictions are compared with empirical data gathered using various methanol-gasoline blend on a test-rig. Model predictions are found to correlate significantly with measured film and droplet tempera- ture data. 941880. A major origin of cyclic energy conversion variations in si engines: cycle-by-cycle variations of the equivalence ratio and residual gas of the initial charge. G. Grünefeld and V. Beushausen, Laser-Laboratorium Göttingen ; P. Andersen, Univer- sity of Bielefeld; and W. Hentschel, Volkswagen AG. It is demonstrated that the cycle-by-cycle variations in the IMEP of a realistic automobile engine with port fuel injection are domi- nated by the cyclic fluctuations of the equivalence ratio and residual gas content of the initial charge at least for certain operating condi- tions. A new spontaneous Raman scattering technique yields simul- taneously the densities of fuel, C&gt;2,N2, and H2O prior to ignition. In- cylinder equivalence ratio and residual gas content are determined quantitatively with high precision by ratios of densities. Prior-cycle effects are observed and explained by the properties of the initial charge. The results show that cyclic variability can be explained and may be consequently reduced by the help of the new measurement system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941881. Measuring absolute-cylinder pressure and pressure drop across intake valves of firing engines. Paulius V. Puz- inauskas and Joseph C. Eves, Colorado State Univ.; and Nohr F. Tillman, SuperFlow Corp. This paper describes a technique which can accurately measure firing-cylinder full-load absolute pressure during critical intake events, thereby providing useful cylinder-pressure data for valve- timing optimization. To achieve this, an absolute- pressure trans- ducer is connected to a port drilled through the cylinder wall at an axial location uncovered approximately midway through the piston stroke. This placement spares the transducer from thermal shock caused by flame-front impingement upon the diaphragm, since the combustion is normally completed by the crank angle of passage exposure. The described technique was used to study valve-timing and manifold-runner design effects on the intake process of a V-8 engine and to determine thermal-shock magnitudes and their effect on con- ventionally-measured pumping-loop data. The results indicate the technique could be a valuable intake-system development tool and also revealed large thermal-shock errors which destroyed conven- tionally-measured pumping-loop accuracy. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941882. Air flow distribution on the transient conditions of si engine. Mikio Furuyama, Zhang Jie, and Hideyuki Konishi, Chiba Univ. In order to study air flow distribution to individual cylinders of an SI engine at transient conditions, a new small- sized high- response air flow meter was investigated and developed to measure instantaneous sir flow rates. The experiments were performed with changes in initial throttle opening, throttle movement angle and period, and crank-angle at the opening of the throttle valve and related engine speeds. Air flow rates for individual cylinders of a four cylinder engine were measured during acceleration. The relative rising rate was used for estimation of air distribution valves, namely, the ratio of the initial amount of increased air flow rate to the air flow rate for each cylinder. Air flow begins to increase from the second induction stroke from throttle opening. The varia- tions of crank-angle at throttle opening influences the rate of increase. The effect of transient conditions on air flow rate distribu- tion was researched. The fluctuation relationship of throttle opening and air flow rate was clarified for transient behavior. The results of this paper are useful for determining the supply of fuel to accom- plish precise air/fuel control and to decrease the engine fuel con- sumption. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941883. Friction and stick-slip durability testing of atf. William C. Ward, Jr., James L. Sumiejski, Christian J. Castanien, Thomas A. Tagliamonte, and Elizabeth A. Schiferl, Lubrizol Corp. Recent commercial specification revisions for automatic trans- mission fluids (ATFs) have focused upon more stringent friction requirements. More stringent friction durability characteristics are assessed using the SAE No. 2 tester. The commercial specifications do not include provisions to evaluate low speed friction characteris- tics, which have been shown to relate to torque converter shudder. This paper focuses upon effective use of the Falex 6 Multispeci- men Tester to evaluate friction durability and to evaluate low speed friction characteristics in conjunction with low speed friction appa- ratus (LVFA) testing. Falex 6 testing agreed with torque fade observed in SAE No. 2 tests. Low speed stick-slip durability charac- teristics were effectively differentiated for a number of field ATFs. Falex 6 testing coupled with LVFA testing was shown to correlate with field experience and other test methods related to torque con- verter shudder. Finally, a Variable Speed Friction Tester (VSFT) was developed to improve test method continuity and improve test quality. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 230</page><page sequence="230">941884-941894 941884. Improvements to the aluminum beaker oxidation test (abot) for automatic transmission fluids. Thomas S. Derev- janik, Lubrizol Corp . The Aluminum Beaker Oxidation Test (ABOT) is a bench test required for official Ford MERCON® automatic transmission fluid (ATF) qualification. A continuous quality improvement approach identified inconsistent pump performance as the leading cause of test variability. A modified pump was developed to obtain consis- tent performance. The modified pump had a higher flow rate and a greater inlet suction than the original pump. An improved data acquisition and control system monitored and controlled the major test variables including pump operation. Our baseline fluid control limits decreased by 70 % using the new ABOT system. From an experimental matrix, the new ABOT differentiated good, borderline and fail samples. The experimental data also show that a continuous 300 hour test sequence does not adversely affect test results. This paper documents the development of the modified pump and the results of baseline and matrix testing using the new ABOT system. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941885.

This paper provides information about the origins and some of the reasoning regarding a questionnaire submitted to all licensees of the MERCON® and DEXRON® automatic transmission service fluid programs. These questions were generated to help the licensed transmission fluid marketer communicate to the licensors the pro- cesses which are in place within each blending and packaging facil- ity to guarantee a consistent quality product. The questionnaire is being implemented in 1994 and is provided as an Appendix to this paper. 941887. Friction characteristics of DEXRON®-III automatic transmission fluids. James L. Linden and Russell F. Stebar, Gen- eral Motors NAO Research and Development Center; and Steven P. Kemp, General Motors Powertrain Division. The friction characteristics of several DEXRON®-III automatic transmission fluids were examined in a variety of friction tests. These evaluations included tests with SAE No. 2 Friction Machines using either Band or Plate heads, breakaway friction tests, and low- sliding speed friction tests. The effect of bulk fluid temperature on friction performance was examined in band tests and in breakaway tests using the plate clutch apparatus. The DEXRON®-III fluids were compared to the previous generation automatic transmission fluids. Results showed that the DEXRON®-III fluids exhibited more desirable friction characteristics; for example, with the DEX- RON®-III fluids in the band machine, dynamic friction remained stable during sustained operation at high temperature, whereas with DEXRON®-IIE fluids, dynamic friction decreased as much as 25%. Band tests and breakaway friction tests at various temperatures showed fluid friction characteristics and durability to be sensitive to bulk fluid temperature, but with the DEXRON®-III fluid being less sensitive than the DEXRON®-IIE fluid. 941889. Mechanism of combustion chamber deposit forma- tion. Daniel T. Daly, Lubrizol Corp.; Sean A. Bannon, Chrysler Corp.; and Dennis A. Fog and Scott M. Harold, Lubrizol Corp. Two V-6 engine types were investigated for the physical mecha- nisms causing combustion chamber deposit (CCD) formation. Experimental techniques and parameters such as combustion cham- ber deposit weights, thicknesses, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to determine both the chemi- cal and physical characteristics of combustion chamber deposit material. An analysis of the results indicated a mechanism for com- bustion chamber deposit formation consistent with that originally developed by Lepperhoff. Lepperhoff proposed that four layers exist in the combustion chamber deposit morphology. In contrast, the investigation described below has led to identification of only two distinct CCD morphologies. 941890. (SP- 1054) Effects of fuel and additives on combustion chamber deposits. Mitchell M. Jackson and Sara B. Pocinki, Lubri- zol Corp. The effects of gasoline composition, as represented in typical regular and premium unleaded gasolines and fuel additives, on Combustion Chamber Deposits (CCD) were investigated in BMW and Ford tests. In addition, the influences of engine lubricant oil and ethanol oxygenate on CCD were examined in Ford 2.3L engine dynamometer tests. Also, additive effects of packages based on min- eral oil fluidizers versus synthetic fluidizers were studied in several different engines for CCD. Finally, a new method for evaluating the effect of fluidizers on valve sticking is introduced. 941892. (SP- 1054) A physical mechanism for deposit forma- tion in a combustion chamber. Shi-wai Steve Cheng, General Motors NAO Research and Development Center. Combustion chamber deposits in an internal combustion engine are known to impair engine performance. Using a variable tempera- ture probe and retrievable sampling coupons, this study shows that the deposit-forming rate is inversely related to surface temperature, and directly related to the stabilized deposit weight. Together with the well-recognized fact that deposits are good thermal insulators, a deposit-forming mechanism is proposed. As combustion chamber deposits form, in essence the chamber surface is coated with thermal insulators, layer after layer. Consequently, the surface temperature will rise as the deposit grows. The previously derived critical surface temperature of 310°C is found to be valid in this study for fuel-derived deposits. Further- more, a critical surface temperature also exists for oil- derived deposits, except that the critical surface temperature is about 60°C higher than that for fuel-derived deposits. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941893. Effects of gasoline and gasoline detergents on com- bustion chamber deposit formation. Yasunori Takei, Takashi Uehara, Hirohike Hoshi, and Masanori Okada, Toyota Motor Corp. Engine dynamometer tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of detergent additives and gasoline components on combustion chamber deposits (CCD). Additives with polyether amine (PEA) and with polyolefin amine (PO A) chemicals were used. Our results show that some kinds of additives and aromatics in gasoline increase CCD formation. Deterent polyolefin detergents show different ten- dency of CCD formation. The amount of CCD showed good relationship with the unwashed gum level of the gasoline. In general, smaller dosages produce less CCD. This means that detergents which have good IVD and PFID effectiveness at smaller dosage are better with regard to CCD. We analyzed the CCD by C13-NMR, GPC and IR method. The detergent contributes to CCD. Vehicle emissions tests were carried out to evaluate the effects of CCD on exhaust emissions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941894. Modeling of diesel spray impingement on a flat wall. Jiro Senda and Masaaki Kobayashi, Doshisha Univ.; Seiji Iwashita, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; and Hajime Fujimoto, Doshisha Univ. 231</page><page sequence="231">941894-941899 This paper presents an analysis using a model of the dispersion process of a Diesel spray impinging on a flat wall. The objective is to simulate the spray /wall interaction process inside Diesel engines. This analysis has two parts: one for non-evaporative spray and the other for evaporative spray. For the non-evaporative spray analysis, a single spray of n-tridecane was injected at high-pressure from a single hole nozzle into a quiescent atmosphere at room-temperature. The spray impinged vertically on the wall at room temperature. The spray impinged vertically on the wall at room temperature. Thus, the wall temperature Tw was less than the saturation temperature Tsat of the fuel, that is the boiling temperature, a new submodel including fuel film formation on the wall, its breakup process due to droplet impingement and the dispersion process of breakup - droplets was developed. Also, the droplet density distribution was measured experimentally by the laser light extinction method. For the evapo- rative spray analysis, the fuel spray was injected into a high -pres- sure and high - temperature atmosphere and impinged on a wall at a temperature of 550 K. Here, Tw was above Tsat. A submodel for the heat transfer from the wall to the droplet, the breakup behavior of impinging droplets owing to boiling at the liquid - solid interface and the dispersion process of breakup - droplets was considered. Further, the vapor and the liquid phases in the spray were separated experimentally by using exciplex fluorescence method. The new submodels for both temperature conditions were incorporated into the KIVA code and compared with the spray/wall impingement model of Naber and Reitz to calculate the dispersion process. It was found in 2-dimensional calculations that the new submodels have better qualitative agreement with the experimental one, when com- pared with that of Naber and Reitz. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941895. Modeling of diesel spray dynamics and comparison with experiments. Luigi Allocca , Felice E. Cordone , and Annunzi- ata Fusco, Istituto Motori-CNR; and Francesco Papetti, and Sauro Succi, IBM-ECSEC. The capabilities of the Taylor analogy breakup (TAB) and wave breakup (WB) spray models, already existing in the literature, were evaluated in KTVA-II code. Also, a novel droplet deformation and breakup (DDB) model that takes into account the nonlinear effects which manifest at large deformation of the drops was incorporated and tested in KIVA-II. The assessment of the three models was performed by using experimental measurements of tip penetration, spray cone angle and Sauter mean radius (SMR) in a cylinder optically accessible closed vessel at room temperature and high gas density. High speed pho- tography and laser light extinction techniques were simultaneously used to detect data along a n-heptane jet coming out from a single hole nozzle of 0.20 mm diameter supplied by PE- Bosch injection pump operating in single shot by electro- hydraulic device. The KIVA calculations with TAB model in terms of penetration and SMR do not predict accurately the experiments. The WB and DDB models match well the experimental penetration data at low temperature and, at high temperature, the DDB model shows the highest penetration rate suggesting that it is more appropriate for simulating the spray dynamics for small engine like conditions in which the distance between the nozzle tip and the combustion cham- ber wall is very low. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941896. Three-dimensional computations of diesel sprays in a very high pressure chamber. Z. X. Hou and J. Abraham, Univer- sity of Minnesota; and D. L. Siebers, Sandia National Labs. Results of three-dimensional computations of non-vaporizing and vaporizing Diesel sprays in a very high pressure (up to 1804 MPa without combustion) environment are presented. These pres- sures and corresponding density ratios of ambient gas to injected liq- uid are about a factor of two greater than those in current Diesel engines. The spray model incorporates a line source for drops, heat, mass and momentum exchange between the gas and liquid phases, turbulent dispersion of drops, collisions and coalescences, and drop breakup. The accuracy of the model is assessed by making compari- sons of computed and measured spray penetrations. Reasonable agreement is obtained for a broad range of conditions. A scaling for time and axial distance clarifies these results. 941897. Toward predictive modeling of diesel engine intake flow, combustion and emissions. C. J. Rutland, J. Eckhause, G. Hampson, R. Hessel, S. Kong, M. Patterson, D. Pierpont, P. Sweet- land, T. Tow, and R. D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin-Madison. The development of analytic models of diesel engine flow, com- bustion and subprocesses is described. The models are intended for use as design tools by industry for the prediction of engine perfor- mance and emissions to help reduce engine development time and costs. Part of the research program includes performing engine experiments to provide validation data for the models. The experi- ments are performed on a single- cylinder version of the Caterpillar 3406 engine that is equipped with state-of-the-art high pressure elec- tronic fuel injection and emissions instrumentation. In-cylinder gas velocity and gas temperature measurements have also been made to characterize the flows in the engine. The KIVA code is being used for the computations, with improved submodels for liquid breakup, drop distortion and drag, spray/wall impingement with rebounding, sliding and break-up drops, wall heat transfer with unsteadiness and compressibility, multistep kinetics ignition and laminar-turbulent characteristic time combustion models, Zeldovich NOx formation, and soot formation with Nagle Strickland-Constable oxidation. The code also allows computations of the intake flow process in the realistic engine geometry with the two moving intake valves. Significant progress has been achieved in modeling diesel com- bustion and emissions using the improved submodels. Comparisons with measured engine cylinder pressure, and soot and NOx emis- sions data show that the model results are in good agreement with the experiments. This indicates that computer models are now avail- able to provide direction for engine design. Other experimental results have been obtained recently that show that significant reductions in soot and NOx emissions are possible using split injections. The KIVA model is currently being used to gain insight into the reasons for this improved engine performance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941898. Modeling the source of combustion noise in a direct- injection diesel engine using cfd. C. A. Blunsdon and J. C. Dent, Loughborough University of Technology. Combustion noise produced by the direct-injection Diesel engine is a consequence of the dynamic equilibration of the high local pres- sures created in the combustion space following autoignition that stimulates the resonance modes, over a range of frequencies, of the gas contents of the engine cylinder. In this paper Computational Fluid Dynamics has been used to study the effects of changes in engine design and operating parame- ters that, from empirical experience, are known to influence the noise output of an engine, and explanations confirmed or given for well-established behavior. 941899. Three-dimensional computations of the scavenging process in an opposed-piston engine. Yuan-Xian Zhu and Craig Savonen, Detroit Diesel Corp.; and Norman L. Johnson and Anthony A. Amsden, T-3. The effectiveness of scavenging, the displacement of residual combustion gases with fresh air, is examined in an advanced, high power-density diesel engine, consisting of a two-stroke, opposed- piston reciprocator with an ultra-high boost. KIVA-3, a three- dimensional code for modeling reactive flows with fuel injection, is used to study the effect of a variety of design choices on scaveng- ing. The parametric study includes the inclined angle of the intake ports, the exhaust port timing and size and the piston stroke-to-bore ratio. A baseline geometry of the opposed-piston engine is examined in detail, which models an existing mono- cylinder test rig. The 232</page><page sequence="232">941899-941906 baseline design exhibits large asymmetries, nonsteady flow and large recirculation regions that degrade the scavenging. Significant improvement in the scavenging of the baseline design is observed with a uniform inclined angle of the inlet ports of about 20° and with a larger stroke-to-bore ratio (2.0 compared with 1.08). 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 941900.

A phenomenological multi-zone combustion model for DI Diesel engines is presented. The purpose of the study is to develop the capability of predicting engine combustion characteristics and soot emission with reasonable accuracy and economy. A new approach to zone division pattern and the major factors controlling in-zone combustion process is taken in the model for this purpose. Applica- tions of this model are made to two DI Diesel engines and are vali- dated by comparing the calculated and experimental results, a para- metric study is then carried out. 941901. (SP- 1053) Correlation of i/m240 and ftp emissions for alternative motor fuels act test vehicles. Kenneth J. Kelly, National Renewable Energy Lab. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is manag- ing a series of light duty vehicle chassis dynamometer emissions tests on alternative fuel vehicles for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), this testing program is part of a larger demonstration of alternative fuel vehicles that was mandated by the alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA). As part of the AMFA program, light duty vehicle performance, operational costs, maintenance, and fuel economy are also being collected by NREL' s Alternative Fuels Uti- lization Program staff and disseminated through the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC). In Phase 1 of the AMFA emissions test program (AMFA I), 1 8 vehicles were tested by three laboratories. All the vehicles tested under AMFA I were 1991 model year. In Phase 2 of the program (AMFA II), the number of vehicles was increased to nearly 300, including M85 Dodge Spirits, E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline) Chevrolet Luminas, and compressed natural gas (CNG) Dodge pas- senger vans. Each of these vehicles is to be tested at odometer read- ings of 4,000; 10,000; 20,000; and subsequent intervals of 10,000 miles. Flexible or variable fuel vehicles are being tested on three test fuels, including 85% alcohol/15% gasoline, 50% alcohol/50% gaso- line, and reformulated gasoline. All the MAFA II vehicles are 1992- 1994 model year. Phase II testing includes a Federal Test Procedure (FTP) test, fol- lowed by two of the EPA' s Inspection/Maintenance (I/M240) tests. The I/M240 tests were intended for use as criteria for deciding whether to retest vehicles, the tests were also used to begin develop- ing a data base to determine if the less- expensive I/M240 could sub- stitute for the FTP in future emissions testing. Considering data from early results from the AMFA II testing, we looked at issues such as repeatability of the I/M240 and FTP tests and the correlation of the I/M240 to the FTP test. We con- cluded that the I/M240 test is not an appropriate comparison to the FTP. Further, the I/M240 test is not as reliable as the FTP in estimat- ing the "real world" emissions of these relatively low-emission vehicles. 941903. (SP- 1057) Determination of combustion products from alternative fuels, part 1: lpg and eng combustion products. Kevin A. Whitney, Southwest Research Institute; and Brent K. Bai- ley, National Renewable Energy Lab. Regulated and volatile organic exhaust species were character- ized from a 1993 Chevrolet Lumina operating on CNG, LPG, and reformulated gasoline. For the gaseous fuels, aftermarket conver- sion kits were installed on the vehicle, and the resulting exhaust emissions were compared to the gasoline baseline results. For all of the fuels, the vehicle was operated over the chassis dynamometer portion of the Federal Test Procedure for light-duty vehicles at fuel/ air equivalence ratios of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2; and exhaust emissions were sampled both with and without the catalytic converter in place. Analyses of exhaust samples included determination of regulated exhaust emissions by CFR methods, hydrocarbon speciation and aldehydeand ketone analyses according to Auto/Oil Phase II meth- ods, and the determination of trace exhaust species by mass spectral analysis methods. Speciation data showed greater than 87 percent of all LPG and greater than 95 percent of all CNG hydrocarbon exhaust constituents to be composed of Ci to C3 compounds. In addition, toxic emissions from the combustion of CNG and LPG were as low as 10 percent of those generated by combustion of gaso- line. A comparison of ozone forming potential of the three fuels was made based on the Maximum Incremental Reactivity scale used by the California Air Resources Board. Post-catalyst results from stoi- chiometric operation indicated that LPG and CNG produced 63 per- cent and 88 percent less potential ozone than reformulated gasoline, respectively. On average over all equivalence ratios, CNG and LPG exhaust constituents were approximately 65 percent less reactive than those from reformulated gasoline. Finally, GC/MS analysis identified a number of nitrogen-containing hydrocarbon compounds in LPG and CNG exhaust. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941904. (SP- 1053) The high-temperature pyrolysis and oxi- dation of methanol and ethanol: experimental results and com- parison with vehicle emission tests. Philip H. Taylor, Santosh Shanbhag, and Barry Dellinger, University of Dayton Research Institute. Experimental results of the fuel-lean, stoichiometric, and fuel- rich oxidation of methanol and ethanol using two fused silica tubular flow reactor systems are reported. For the initial set of experiments, semi-quantitative reaction byproduct data were obtained using in- line GC-MS analysis. Subsequent quantitative experiments with a second flow reactor system were conducted with an in-line water trap coupled to GC-TCD analysis. A much larger number of reaction byproducts were observed for ethanol than methanol. For methanol, observed reaction byproducts were acetone, formaldehyde, 1, 2, 3-trioxane, methane, ethane, and ethane. For ethanol, observed reac- tion byproducts were acetone, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, acetic acid, methane, ethane, ethane, ethyne, and propene. Favorable com- parisons of the flow reactor data with vehicle emission test results are presented. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941905. (SP- 1053) Ozone precursor emissions from alterna- tively fueled vehicles. Peter Gabele, U.S. Environmental Protec- tion Agency. Smog chamber tests were conducted using automobile exhaust gas generated during emission tests with a group of alternatively fueled vehicles. The tests were designed to evaluate the photochemi- cal characteristics of organic emissions from vehicles operating on compressed natural gas, methanol, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, and reformulated gasolines. A description of the emission character- ization portion of the study is presented in this paper to assist in bet- ter understanding the chamber experiments described in a compan- ion paper. The study is part of a larger program in which the U.S. department of energy (DOE), in cooperation with the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA), is examining the effects of alter- native fuel usage on emissions and fuel economy. 941906. (SP- 1053) Development of a photochemical chamber system for determining measures of reactivity from exhaust of alternative-fuel vehicles. Tadeusz Kleindienst, Fang Liu, and Eric Corse, M anTech Environmental Technology, Inc.; and Joseph Buf alini, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A laboratory system has been developed to evaluate the photo- chemical characteristics of exhaust generated from alternative-fuel and new technology vehicles. This system is built around an 8-m3 233</page><page sequence="233">941906-941908 photochemical chamber constructed of Teflon film. The chamber has been designed to be portable and allow both indoor and outdoor irradiations. The indoor irradiation system uses a combination of ultraviolet fluorescent bulbs to match, to the extent possible, solar radiation. Exhaust from the test vehicles is generated in an adjoining dynamometer facility. Exhaust can be added directly to the chamber from the dilution tunnel or collected in intermediate Teflon bags and then added to the chamber. For vehicles having relatively low emis- sions the second approach is required. Instrumentation associated with the chamber system includes continuous monitors for measur- ing NOx and ozone, hydrocarbons from both reactant and product mixtures, peroxyacyl nitrates, and carbonyl compounds. Irradiations were conducted on 10 vehicle-fuel combinations. The fuels include reformulated and other alternative fuels, emissions were collected during Bag 1 of the Federal Test Procedure to ensure sufficient exhaust hydrocarbon during the irradiation. Similar initial conditions were set for each vehicle-fuel combination to allow eval- uation (to the extent possible) of differences in reactivity of the exhaust mixture. Reactivity parameters, such as the rate of NO oxi- dation and the rate of ozone formation, were examined for irradia- tions of the exhaust mixtures. Formation of toxic species (perox- yacyl) nitrates and carbonyls) was also determined during the study, this paper describes the motivation for the experiments, details on the experimental design, and the data from irradiations of the exhaust of three fuels using a single vehicle. The reduction in air pollution resulting from the advances in motor vehicle emission control technology of the 1980s and 1990s is being offset by increased numbers of vehicles on the nation's roadways (growth in vehicle miles traveled), and by a persistence of malfunctioning vehicles. As a consequence, the U.S. Congress, in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, has required further reduc- tion of emissions from new motor vehicles, introduction of environ- mentally favorable reformulations of conventional diesel and gaso- line fuels, and introduction of alternative fuels such as methanol, ethanol, and natural gas with associated vehicle technologies. Gaso- line reformulation must result in reduction of both ozone-forming volatile organic compound (VOC) and toxic compound (formalde- hyde, acetaldehyde, polycyclic organic matter, benzene, and 1, 3-butadiene) emissions, the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA) also mandated the introduction of alternatives to conven- tional vehicle and fuel technologies. This legislation and the considerable difficulty in meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone and CO in metro- politan areas have resulted in initiatives to develop reformulated and alternative fuels. With historical phase-out of leaded gasoline addi- tives, aromatic hydrocarbon levels have increased to maintain nec- essary fuel octane. However, aromatic compounds can be important ozone precursors and contribute to elevated benzene emissions. Part of the developing strategy to maintain octane while removing aro- matic compounds has been the introduction of alcohols and aliphatic ethers into gasoline blends. For example, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethanol are being used in many areas in the country as additives in winter grade gasolines for CO emissions reduction. Oxygenates will also be used in summer gasolines in areas requiring reformulated gasoline for ozone abatement. In addition to changes and improvements in fuels, considerable efforts are being made by automotive companies to produce vehicles that generate lower levels of exhaust and evaporative emissions. New technology vehicles are also being developed to use alterna- tives to conventional fuels. The federal government, through AMFA, is leading in the purchase of vehicles that operate on metha- nol, ethanol, and compressed natural gas (CNG). This effort is expected to demonstrate feasibility for introduction of large num- bers of these vehicles into the general population over the next dozen years. As new fuels and vehicle technologies are introduced and ultimately become predominant, the distribution of compounds introduced into the atmosphere, particular the urban atmosphere, will change considerably. Thus, the potential air quality effects of vehicle exhaust and evaporative emissions resulting from use of these fuels and their photodegradation products must be assessed. This information is vital for determining tropospheric lifetimes, effects on ozone forma- tion, and possible generation of toxic and genotoxic products in the atmosphere. In response to these needs, a multitude of changes in vehicle design, fuel composition, and emission control technology are being investigated by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, automotive manufacturers, and petroleum pro- ducers. The formation of ozone and other toxic compounds from photo- chemical transformations of automotive exhaust are frequently stud- ied in laboratory smog chambers. Frequently, surrogate mixtures are used to represent automotive exhaust and/or evaporative emissions, this approach allows reproducible mixtures to be produced in the chamber to examine the effect of individual compounds or other physical variables. However, this approach makes it difficult, if not imposs 941907. (SP- 1052) Coal-water-slurry autoignition in a high- speed détroit diesel engine. James A. Sçhwalb and Thomas W. Ryan , Southwest Research Institute; and Ramesh M. Kakwani and Richard E. Winsor , Detroit Diesel Corp. Autoignition of coal-water-slurry (CWS) fuel in a two-stroke engine operating at 1900 PRM has been achieved. A Pump-Line- Nozzle (PLN) injection system, delivering 400mm3/injection of CWS, was installed in one modified cylinder of a Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) 8V-149TI engine, while the other seven cylin- ders remained configured for diesel fuel. Coal Combustion was sus- tained by maintaining high gas and surface temperatures with a combination of hot residual gases, warm inlet air admission, ceramic insulated components and increased compression ratio. The coal- fueled cylinder generated 85kW indicated power (80 percent of rated power), and lower NOx levels with a combustion efficiency of 99.2 percent. 941908. (SP- 1052) Improvement of performance and emis- sions of a compression ignition methanol engine with dimethyl ether. Jianwei Guo, Takemi Chikahisa, and Tadashi Murayama, Hokkaide Univ.; and Masaharu Miyano, Riken Corp. Dimethyl ether (DME) has very good compression ignition char- acteristics, and can be converted from methanol using a y-alumina catalyst. A previous report investigated a compression ignition methanol engine with DME as an ignition improver. The results showed that the engine operation was sufficiently smooth without either spark or glow plugs. Two methods were studied, one was an aspiration method, and the other was a torch ignition chamber method (TIC method). The aspiration method allows a simple engine structure, but suffers from poor engine emissions and requires large amounts of DME. With the TIC method where the DME was introduced into a torch ignition chamber (TIC) during the intake stroke, the diffusion of the DME into the main combustion chamber was limited, and significant reductions in both the neces- sary quantity of DME and emissions were obtained. In the previous experiment, the cylinder pressure could not be measured because the TIC was installed in the hole of the pressure transducer, and optimization of the TIC was not attempted. In this study, a new TIC head, with the TIC close to the center of the main combustion chamber, was designed for the TIC method. The possibility for further improvements in reducing the quantities of DME and emissions were investigated by optimizing the TIC position, methanol injection timing, DME injection timing, and intake and exhaust throttling. It was found that the necessary amount of DME was greatly reduced when optimizing methanol and DME injection timings. Intake throttling has little effect on the reduction in the quantity of DME, but exhaust throttling can reduce the mini- mum amount of DME. As a result, the quantity of DME was finally reduced to 5% of the total energy supply, or 1/10 of that needed with 234</page><page sequence="234">941908-941918 the aspiration method over a wide range of engine operating condi- tions 941909. (SP- 1052) Controlling combustion characteristics using a slit nozzle in a direct-injection methanol engine. Jin Kusaka, Yasuhiro Daisho, Takeshi Saito , and Ryoji Kihara, Waseda Univ. A new type of fuel injection nozzle, called a "slit nozzle/' has been developed to improve poor ignitability and to stabilize com- bustion under load conditions in direct-injection methanol diesel engines manufactured for medium-duty trucks. This nozzle has a single oblong vent like a slit. Engine test results indicate that the slit nozzle can improve combustion and thermal efficiency, especially at low loads and no load. This can be explained by the fact that the slit nozzle forms a more highly concentrated methanol spray around the glow-plug than do multi- hole nozzles. As a result, this nozzle improves flame propagation. 941910. (SP- 1052) 2-cycle methanol Ihr engine and it's char- acteristic. Shigeo Sekiyama, Hideo Kawamura, and Hiroshi Matsu- oka, Isuzu Ceramics Research Institute. Methanol fuel was tested in a prototype 2-cycle ceramic heat insulated engine with a swirl chamber. It was found that the 2- cycle ceramic heat insulated engine with a compression ratio of 18: 1 could ignite methanol without an auxiliary ignition system and emissions were substantially reduced in the whole load range. 941911. (SP- 1052) Performance of thin-ceramic-coated com- bustion chamber with gasoline and methanol as fuels in a two- stroke si engine. Rames h B. Poola, Ar gonne National Lab.; and B. Nagalingam and K. V. Gopalakrishnan, Indian Institute of Technol- ogy . The performance of a conventional, carbureted, two-stroke spark-ignition (SI) engine can be improved by providing moderate thermal insulation in the combustion chamber. This will help to improve the vaporization characteristics in particular at part load and medium loads with gasoline fuel and high-latent-heat fuels such as methanol. In the present investigation, the combustion chamber surface was coated with a 0.5-mm thickness of partially stabilized zirconia, and experiments were carried out in a single-cylinder, two- stroke SI engine with gasoline and methanol as fuels. Test results indicate that with gasoline as a fuel, the thin ceramic-coated com- bustion chamber improves the part load to medium load operation considerably, but it affects the performance at higher speeds and at higher loads to the extent of knock and loss of brake power by about 18%. However, with methanol as a fuel, the performance is better under most of the operating range and free from knock. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions are significantly reduced, by about 3 to 4% volume, for both gasoline and methanol fuels due to relatively lean operation and more complete combustion. NOx emissions were not measured. The results show that moderate thermal insulation of the two- stroke SI engine's combustion chamber is better suited to methanol fuel with respect to thermal efficiency, CO emissions, and knock-free operation compared to gasoline fuel. 941913. (SP- 1057) British Columbia vehicle emissions inspec- tion and maintenance program experience of alternative fuel vehicle conversions. Stephen Stewart , David Gourley , and Sam Loo, Province of British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Highways. Basing its conclusions on aver one million gasoline vehicle inspections and over 30,000 alternative fueled vehicle inspections, this paper examines the pass/fail records for each fuel; the problems most common to failing vehicles; and repair strategies used to cor- rect those problems. The paper specifically describes the relationship between the level of technology used in alternative fuel systems and their emis- sions performance. It is shown that alternative fueled vehicles are not inherently clean, and that to meet the same emissions standards as gasoline vehicles the alternative fuel system should employ the same level of technology as used in the original gasoline vehicle. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941914. (SP- 1052) Potential impact of four different car fuels on the dutch environment. Rudolf C. Rijkeboer, Peter Hendriksen, Bas Hollemans, and Jouke van der Weide, TNO Road Vehicle Research Institute. The closed-loop three way catalyst on the European market has considerably reduced the emissions of passenger cars in an absolute sense. The question arose if gaseous fuels still have a real advantage. To answer this question an extensive program was set up to compare gasoline and diesel with LPG and natural gas. Not only the regulated components, but also a whole range of unregulated components were measured, the resulting data were grouped into environmental aspects, such as direct local toxicity, long term toxicity, smog, acidi- fication and global warming. The conclusion is that gaseous fuels still hold an advantage over liquid fuels. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941915. (SP- 1057) Development of a benchtop fuel lubricity assessment method. John G. Eleftherakis and Xiaojian Tao, Fluid Technologies, Inc.; and Michael J. Harrigan, Ford Motor Co. Rapid development of automotive fuels has occurred in the past ten to fifteen years resulting in reformulated and alternative liquid fuels together with a myriad of fuel additives aimed primarily at improving combustion and tail pipe emissions. Many of these changes have had significant but unreported or unmeasured effects on the physical properties of the fuels. This paper presents the details of a program which sought to characterize the lubricity (or antiwear) characteristics of known gas- oline formulations with a bench top assessment test machine and to correlate these results to actual fuel pump wear debris generation tests. 941916. (SP- 1052) Effect of eng start - gasoline run on emis- sions from a 3/4 ton pick-up truck. Karl J. Springer, Lawrence R. Smith, and Alan G. Dickinson, Southwest Research Institute. This paper describes experiments to determine the effect on exhaust emissions of starting on compressed natural gas (CNG) and then switching to gasoline once the catalyst reaches operating tem- perature. Carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and detailed exhaust hydrocarbon speciation data were obtained for dedicated CNG, then unleaded gasoline, and finally CNG start - gasoline run using the Federal Test Procedure at 24°C and at -7°C. The result was a reduc- tion in emissions from the gasoline baseline, especially at -7°C. It was estimated that CNG start - gasoline run resulted in a 71 percent reduction in potential ozone formation per mile. 941918. Investigation of diesel spray structure and spray/wall interactions in a constant volume pressure vessel. James A. Schw- alb, Thomas W. Ryan, and Lee G. Dodge, Southwest Research Insti- tute. High-speed movie films, and laser-diffraction drop sizing were used to evaluate the structure, penetration rate, cone angle, and drop size distribution of diesel sprays in a constant volume pressure ves- sel. As further means of evaluating the data, comparisons are made between the film measurements, and calculations from a dense gas jet model. In addition to the high-speed film data that describes the overall structure of the spray as a function of time, a laser diffraction instrument was used to measure drop size distribution through a cross-section of the spray. In terms of the growth of the total spray volume (a rough measure of the amount of air entrained in the spray), spray impingement causes an initial delay, but generally the same overall growth rate as an equivalent unimpeded spray. Agreement between measure- ments and calculations is excellent for a diesel spray with a 0. 15 mm D orifice and relatively high injection pressures. Drop sizes of 15-30 micrometers were measured at these injection conditions. 235</page><page sequence="235">941919-941925 941919. Injection pressure and intake air density effects on ignition and combustion in a 4-valve diesel engine. Thomas W. Ryan and S. M. Shahed, Southwest Research Institute. Diesel engine optimization for low emissions and high efficiency involves the use of very high injection pressures. It was generally thought that increased injection pressures lead to improved fuel air mixing due to increased atomization in the fuel jet. Injection experi- ments in a high-pressure, high-temperature flow reactor indicated, however, that high injection pressures, in excess of 150 MPa, leads to greatly increased penetration rates and significant wall impinge- ment. An endoscope system was used to obtain movies of combustion in a modern, 4-valve, heavy-duty diesel engine. Movies were obtained at different speeds, loads, injection pressures, and intake air pressures. The movies indicated that high injection pressure, cou- pled with high intake air density leads to very short ignition delay times, ignition close to the nozzle, and burning of the plumes as they traverse the combustion chamber. Reduction of either the injection pressure or the intake air density leads to increased ignition delay times and corresponding changes in the location of ignition away from the nozzle, with early combustion occurring close to the com- bustion chamber wall and moving inward toward the nozzle. 941920. Visualization of diesel spray by laser sheet method. Tetuya Kusakabe, KAO Corp.; and Mituhiro Tsue and Toshikazu , Kadota, University of Osaka Perfecture. The authors have observed diesel spray structures by laser sheet Mie scattering methods at room temperature under several ambient pressures (from 0.0 KPa to 2. 1 MPa), and measured spray penetra- tions, spray-angles and spray inner structures of light diesel oil. The results of spray-angle measurements showed that the spray-angle increased with an increase in the ambient pressure near a nozzle tip. The spray-angle far from the nozzle tip had the minimum value of spray angle at about 0.6 MPa ambient pressure. The spray structure had periodic high density portions occurring at a constant frequency (about 80 KHz). The frequency was time invariant and independent of ambient pressure. These results suggested that the periodic por- tions were caused by the inner structure of the injector or the struc- ture of the nozzle. 941921. Influence of the starting aid position on airflow, spray formation and combustion in a production idi-diesel engine by high-speed filming via endoscopes. Hinrich Mohr , Technische Univ.; and Werner Hentschel, Volkswagen AG. The influence of the starting aid position on air flow, spray for- mation and combustion in a production-IDI-Diesel engine for pas- senger cars was investigated via endoscopes, laser techniques and a high-speed film system. Simultaneous observation in the swirl chamber as well as in the main combustion chamber allows detailed analysis of the complex inflammation and combustion processes. The results of this research work show the importance of the starting aid position in the swirl chamber for normal operation of the engine. The airflow was found to be very sensitive to the flow conditions, so that the following processes as spray formation, inflammation and combustion were influenced. For a nearly undis- turbed air stream and a fast combustion a tangential located starting sid leewards of the fuel jet can be recommended. 941922. New concept for six-stroke diesel engine. Masataka Arai and Kenii Amagai, Gunma Univ.; and Yuichi Ida, Nishin Steel Co., Ltd. In this report, a new six-stroke diesel engine is proposed and the thermodynamic performances of this engine are numerically and experimentally analyzed. Since the six-stroke diesel engine intro- duced here has two combustion processes in one cycle, it offers new methods of combustion control which can't be attained in an ordi- nary four-stroke diesel engine. In the analysis, we use a simple sin- gle zone thermodynamic model with considering the Weibe's func- tion for heat release rate and the Woschni's equation for heat trans- fer coefficient. As a results, it was confirmed when the heat release of 1st combustion stroke and 2nd combustion stroke were equiva- lent, the maximum in-cylinder gas temperature was the lowest, and further it was lower than that of the four stroke diesel engine. 941923. Attitude control of a diesel spray under the coanda effect. Masataka Arai, Kenji Amagai, and Takumi Ebara, Gunma Univ. In this paper, a new concept of an attitude control of a diesel spray was proposed. The Coanda effect known in the fields of the fluidics was applied to control a penetrating direction of a diesel spray injected into a combustion chamber of a D.I. diesel engine. In general, a jet moving along a wall was deviated by the Coanda effect. So if the shape of a cavity crown of the combustion chamber would be suitably designed and a diesel spray behavior would be similar to a gaseous jet, the spray might penetrate along the cavity wall. Furthermore, the switching effect of the penetrating direction might appear with a piston movement. To establish this method for an attitude control of a diesel spray, behavior of a diesel spray that was affected by a fixed interference plate located near the spray axis was experimentally investigated. 941924. On the air-entrainment characteristics of diesel sprays and flames in a quiescent atmosphere. Shi-Wen Li, Hiden- ori Kosaka, and Takeyuki Kamimoto, Toyko Institute of Technology. Air-entrainment characteristics of non-evaporating sprays and flames were measured by means of high-speed photography includ- ing ordinary shadowgraphy of sprays, back diffused light illumina- tion photography and laser shadow photography of flames. Effects of injection pressure and nozzle orifice diameter on air-entrainment characteristics were investigated parametrically. The amount of air entrained into a flame was calculated by a two-zone thermodynamic model with data obtained from the photographs and the pressure measurement in the combustion chamber. The air- entrainment char- acteristics of flames were compared with those of the corresponding sprays. It showed that immediately after the start of ignition, the air entrainment into a flame increased more rapidly as compared with the corresponding spray and then, with the development of diffusion combustion, the air entrainment gradually approached that of the spray. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941925. Modeling of atomization process in flash boiling spray. Jiro Senda, Yoshiyuki Hojyo, and Hajime Fujimoto, Dosh- isha Univ. This paper presents the analysis of atomization and vaporization processes in a flash boiling spray based on experimental results obtained from injection systems in the suction manifold of a gaso- line engine. Two kinds of liquid fuel, n-Pentane and n-Hexane, were injected into quiescent atmosphere at room-temperature and low- pressure through a pintle type injector with electronic control. The spray characteristics of both fuels below various atmospheric pres- sures were investigated in detail by taking photography. Then, in the region of flash boiling, where the back pressure was below the satu- rated vapor pressure of fuel, the bubble nucleation process due to the flash boiling was modeled by both the measurement results of bubble and the nucleation rate equation using the degree of super heat of the liquid fuel. Further, the fuel vaporization process was assessed by the bubble growth calculation in vapor cavitation phe- nomena, the fuel evaporation due to boiling from the liquid film sur- face and the evaporation process from the film surface and the evap- oration process from the film surface owing to heat transfer between the ambient gas and the liquid film. Accordingly, the transient change in the bubble diameter and the vapor mass fraction inside the spray are estimated quantitatively for each back pressure. The calculated results, such as the shape of fuel film jet and the fuel droplet diameter in the spray, agree well with the experimental results. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 236</page><page sequence="236">941926-941931 941926. Ford 4- val ve light-duty di diesel development. R. J. Menne , Ford-Werke AG; and P. J. Lawrence , R. W. Florrocks, and P. S. Robertson , Ford Motor Co., Ltd. This paper recounts a brief history of Ford high speed direct injection (HSDI) diesel engines; from the original 2.5 litre naturally aspirated (NA) engine introduced 10 years ago as the world's first high volume HSDI diesel, followed by the introduction of the turbo- charged version in 1992 with drive-by- wire electronic fuel injection pump, to the latest low emission version developed to meet recent European Commission (EC) ''Stage 2" 94/12/EC standards. The performance development of a prototype 4-valve per cylinder ver- sion of the 2.5 litre engine is briefly described, covering the fuel injection equipment, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) tolerance, reg- ulated emissions capability including the important oxides of nitro- gen (NOx) and particulates trade-off, and the performance potential of this combustion system. It is concluded that the 4-valve per cylin- der configuration provides significant benefits for emissions achiev- ing a superior NOx/particulates trade-off compared to the 2-valve version of the same engine. The performance potential is demon- strated by the achievement of 1 6 bar BMEP peak torque. It is finally concluded that this technology will enable light-duty diesels to meet the forecast European emission standards due at the end of this decade and remain the most efficient prime mover for passenger cars and light trucks. 941927. analysis of disc combustion using a pilot flame igni- tion system. Wenbin Xu, Yasuo Moriyoshi, and Takumi Muroki, Chiba Univ. A new DISC combustion system with a pilot flame for ignition was analyzed by using a model combustion chamber of a Wankel type rotary engine. A two-stroke diesel engine's cylinder head was replaced with this combustion chamber to simulate temporal changes of air flow and pressure fields inside the chamber as in actual engines. Two types of fuel injection systems were tested to obtain combustion characteristics such as the heat release rate. Direct photographs of spray and combustion were analyzed to understand the mixture-formation process of the main spray and to see the flame temperature distribution and flame moving velocity vectors. In order to understand the mixture-formation process, numerical calculations were made using a gaseous fuel. Finally, the effect of the fuel characteristics on combustion was examined using diesel fuel and n-hexane. 941928. The method for development of a diesel engine uni- versal performance map. A. A. Golverk, Beer-Sheva. Multi-parameter characteristics (performance maps) of the diesel engines of large, medium, and small power have been investigated. The operation regimes with nominal (rated) brake specific fuel con- sumption (BSFC) and estimated characteristics of the engines' fuel economy have been determined. The method for plotting normalized multi-parameter engine characteristics within dimensionless coordinates has been developed along with the method for generalization of normalized multi- parameter characteristics of the engines with different rated power. Also, the universal performance map suitable for a diesel engine of arbitrary power has been obtained. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941929. CFD investigation of the scavenging process in a two- stroke engine. Laurine J. Leep and Gary S. Strumolo, Ford Motor Co.; Vladimir Griaznov and Subrata Sengupta, University of Michi- gan; and Andreas Brohmer and Juergen Meyer, Ford-Werke AG. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of the gas exchange process in a crankcase-scavenging, two-stroke engine were used to study the scavenging characteristics of the engine over the whole operating range and to investigate the effects of various design changes. The simulations used time-dependent velocity and pressure boundary conditions in the transfer and exhaust ports, respectively, which were obtained from a one-dimensional gas exchange code. The bulk flow characteristics, scavenging and trapping efficiencies, computed from these simulations compared well with experimental data. Investigation of the highest load and speed case showed that moderate port angle variations only weakly influenced the scaveng- ing efficiency and velocity field. On the other hand, modifying the exhaust pressure to simulate single cylinder operation had a more significant effect on the scavenging and showed a possible way to control the gas exchange process. 941930. Modeling of early pressure rise and flame growth in a spark ignition engine. M. Anbarasu and Duane L. Abata, Michi- gan Technological Univ.; and Peter C. Moilanen, Ford Motor Co. A thermodynamical model of the ignition and flame growth pro- cess was developed to understand and minimize cycle-to-cycle vari- ations in pressure due to minor differences in flame kernel growth at the spark plug electrode between cycles. Initial flame kernel size after the spark breakdown process was determined by solving the one-dimensional cylindrical shock flow equation. Overall reaction rates, flame speeds including turbulence and intensity, high temper- ature equilibrium and other thermodynamic properties were calcu- lated by peripheral submodels. Relative effects of spark power, heat loss to the spark plug, and the chemical heat release were studied under varying engine conditions. Results show that breakdown energy has a significant effect on the formation and size of the initial kernel and that the effect of flame kernel velocity on subsequent combustion was considerable at specific engine conditions. Addi- tionally, an appreciable change of rate of pressure rise during glow and arc discharge modes was predicted with changes in spark power and engine speed. This was confirmed experimentally. 941931. A study of air to fuel transient response and compen- sation with different fuels. Göran Almkvist and Sö ren Eriksson, Volvo Car Corp. In order to fulfill the future LEV exhaust emission standards, with different fuel specifications it is necessary to achieve a good control of the air to fuel ratio under transient conditions especially during the warm-up period. The objective in this report was to clar- ify the controlling factors of the exhaust air to fuel ratio response dependency of different fuels in order to provide a correct compen- sation strategy. A mathematical model based on a manifold air flow model and a fuel film model, together with a time delay between air and fuel supply to the engine during the transient, was used for data matching of the measurements. The fuel film model includes a deposit factor (X), an evaporation time constant (t) and a time delay (At). Tests were carried out with three different fuels, typical Euro- pean unleaded fuel, US California phase 2 fuel and US low volatility fuel. The results from the models of delay and wall wetting effects were used for compensation strategy development. Since wall wetting varies with e.g. fuel properties and engine ageing, observer models are discussed to adapt X and x from the k error feedback. This adaptation is made complicated due to the load and engine speed dependency of the wall film mass. The results show that: The deposit factor X and the time constant i are affected by the engine speed, load, temperature and fuel prop- erties. When the engine is hot only T70 to T100 of the distillation curve is relevant for the determination of the X parameter. However, when the engine is cold, a much larger proportion of the distillation curve must be considered. The time constant T is affected most of the temperature in the interval between 60-90°C. The injection tim- ing strongly affects the wall wetting mass. It can be reduced by up to 50% by an open valve injection compared to a closed valve injec- tion. The mass in the fuel film is also strongly affected by engine load, temperature and fuel properties. The wall wetting model with load, engine speed and temperature dependent X and T is 'reversed' to yield a non-linear compensator, which will compensate for both load as well as engine speed variations. The time constant of the 237</page><page sequence="237">941931-941937 wall wetting compensation is smaller than the wall wetting evapora- tion time constant. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941932. Modeling of combustion in the reciprocating engines using a reduced kinetic scheme. El-Houssin Affad and Daniel Puechberty , Université de Rouen; and Kennel Claire, PSA Peugeot- Citroen. The modeling of turbulent combustion is a crucial problem for the numerical simulation of flames and combustion chambers. In this paper turbulent combustion is discussed with a lagrangian model which is useful to study turbulent combustion problems. A coupling between this lagrangian model and a presumed pdf method is used with complex chemistry. The validation of the kinetic mech- anism was studied before integrating it in the computer code for reciprocating engines. The results of computations with the present model are compared with the experimental results obtained from experiences obtained in out laboratory and from PSA engine. These comparisons between modeling and experiments show a good agreement. 941933. High efficiency stoichiometric spark ignition engines. C. DeP etris, S. Diana, V. Giglio, and G. Police, Istituto Motori-C. N.R. Nowadays most passenger cars are equipped with spark ignition engines with a three way catalyst. Thus, the improvement of fuel consumption of this type of engine represents a very attractive goal. In fact, it may cause a reduction of pollutant emission, and simulta- neously it may give a contribution to the lowering of global C02 production. In this paper, a strategy to control the combustion process of stoi- chiometric spark ignition engines is described. It is based on the adoption of Exhaust Gas Recycle (EGR) in high compression ratio engines. The tests carried out have shown that EGR can control the knock, even at Wide Open Throttle (WOT), with a compression ratio of about 13.5. Improvements of efficiency higher than 10%, at different loads and speeds, have been achieved by the adoption of this technique. Similar improvements have been obtained for CO, while more sub- stantial reductions have been measured for NOx. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941934. Rapid characterization of i.e. engine in-cylinder flow at spark: a synergistic approach using experimental and numer- ical simulations. N. Tri gui, L. J. Leep, and J. C. Kent, Ford Motor Co. A new methodology for rapidly characterizing the in-cylinder flow field at spark ignition for internal combustion engines is described in this paper. The process involves the use of 3-D particle tracking velocimetry to measure the flow field at intake valve clos- ing (IVC) in a water analog engine simulation, and the use of CFD to compute the evolution of the measured flow field during the com- pression stroke, by using the experimental 3-D PTV results at IVC as the initial condition for the calculations. The technique has been applied to investigate the in-cylinder flow field of a typical 4 valve engine operating in two different modes; one or two intake ports active. The results indicate that in either mode the flow field at IVC is dominated by a different large scale structure: tumble in the case where both intake ports are active and swirl in the case where only one port is active. The results also indicate that these structures evolve differently during the compres- sion stroke. While swirl decays monotonically during the compres- sion stroke, tumble appears to gain in strength during the early stages of the compression before it starts decaying at a faster rate. In addition, an initial comparison of the results obtained by this hybrid approach with engine combustion data indicates that the burn rate increases with increasing levels of in-cylinder turbulence, which is the expected trend based on combustion entrainment mod- els. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941935. Study on validation of turbulent entrainment com- bustion model for spark-ignition engines. Fanhua Ma, Chuanli Liu, Denting Jiang, and Longbao Zhou, Xi' an Jaiotong Univ. A turbulent entrainment combustion model is considered to be reasonable for the combustion in spark-ignition engines. It is impor- tant to study the validation of this model for different combustion chamber shapes of the engines under various operating conditions. Nevertheless, the verification of this model has not been performed sufficiently. Based on some investigators' work of the turbulent eddy structure and turbulent characteristics in the cylinder of spark- ignition engine, a turbulent entrainment combustion model for spark-ignition engines is developed, and numerical simulation of combustion process is carried out in this study. The model is exam- ined under various operating conditions of engine speed, loads, air- fuel ratio and spark timing for three shapes of combustion chambers: HRCC in head (compression ratio is 10), May process (compression ratio is 10 and 12 respectively) and Bowl-in-piston (compression ratio is 10). The four empirical coefficients for each combustion chamber in the model are determined, and the comparison between the predictions and measurements is done. It verifies that the four empirical coefficients are fixed for the same shape of combustion chambers (regardless of different compression ratio) under various operating conditions, and that the four coefficients vary with shapes of combustion chambers. The calculation results of mass fraction burned, the pressure diagrams, mean indicated pressure, the maxi- mum pressure etc. are in good agreement with the experimental data, thus the model is considered to be valid for predicting the com- bustion of spark-ignition engines. 941936. Numerical optimization for in-cylinder processes of a spark ignition engine. Xiaoping Bi, Shu Han, and Jingyie Wang, Armored Force Engineering Institute. This paper describes the development of a numerical optimiza- tion technique for in-cylinder processes of SI engines, which con- sists of an in-cylinder processes model and an optimization model. The in-cylinder processes model simulates the filli thermody- namic cycle containing spark ignition, turbulent flame propagation, heat release, nitric oxide emission and knock. The optimization model uses a nonlinear mathematical program- ming method, in which effective specific fuel consumption, NO emission and knock index are respectively regarded as objective function or constraint function, spark timing, compression ratio, equivalence ratio and valve timings as independent variables. The numerical optimization for a SI engine is carried out and is validated by experimental results. The engine performances are evi- dently improved by the optimization. 941937. The background, development, and introduction of a genuine heavy duty diesel engine oil. D. P. Carver, Cummins Engine Co.; and P. A. Bennett, Paru Engineering. This paper reviews some of the background which demonstrated that there were significant variations in the performance of commer- cial CD engine oils in highway truck and other heavy duty applica- tions by the mid - 1970's. The paper reports that by 1979 service experience also showed that engine miles to overhaul were signifi- cantly improved when SAE 15W-40 oils were used in place of the earlier typical SAE 30 products. By 1983 it had been established that there was a 2 to 1 variation in miles to overhaul between the poor and the best 15W-40 oils. This service background was the stimulus for the development of a proprietary heavy duty diesel engine oil intended to provide customers with a product incorporating the best available engine oil technology. The initial objective was to maximize engine durability. The development of the Cummins Branded Oil was based directly on field tests of commercial and experimental engine oils in some 200 trucks which operated for more than 40,000,000 miles in internal engine company and cooperative field tests with oil and additive companies over a period of 3 to 5 years. Related commer- cial prototype oils also ran for similar periods of time in larger num- bers of trucks. 238</page><page sequence="238">941937-941944 Lige-cycle cost studies confirmed a marketing strategy which resulted in customers accepting the use of highest quality oils despite their higher selling prices. The use of these highest quality oils was to be a key factor in reducing total truck operating costs. 941938. Diesel engine oil dispersion performance. W. van Dam and J. E. Morris, Oronite European Technical Center. Soot-related oil thickening problems have been reported over the years by multiple OEM's in Europe, Japan, and in the U.S.A. The earliest problems from the late 1970's, were often attributed to adverse changes in operation (lower engine speeds, heavy loads and low air/fuel ratio, or severe operation such as stop-and-go service) which led to a high soot generation rate. In the late 1980's, the emis- sion legislation became more stringent and soot- related oil thicken- ing concerns resurfaced. It appeared that even engines that produced a relatively low level of soot in the exhaust gas showed a high level of soot contamination in the lubricant. For the oil and oil additive industry, the Mack T-7 engine test offered a useful tool to evaluate the ability of oils to disperse soot, but it has been noted that the industry remains without a test based on a European engine to ade- quately evaluate an oil's ability to disperse diesel engine soot. Data from our recent study indicates that a useful test using a European engine has been developed to measure soot-related oil thickening, diesel engine sludge performance, and diesel engine oil gelation. Engine test results were also obtained on field- tested oils and correlation between the engine and the field test has been estab- lished. Coupling the engine test data with oil seal compatibility data from the VW 3344 laboratory bench test, a trade-off among the ash- less dispersants that provide effective diesel engine oil dispersion performance and those that provide effective VW 3344 performance was observed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941939. The world's first diesel engine oil category for use with low-sulfur fuel: API CG-4. J. A. McGeehan, Chevron Research and Technology Co.; T. M. Franklin, Royal Lubricants Co.; F.

Since diesel engine oils are part of the low-emission equation, there has been stepped increases in the quality of crankcase oils with the stepped reduction in diesel exhaust emissions. The new API CG-4 oil category, was developed to address the Engine Manufac- turers Associations' s (EMA' s) needs for 1994 emission-controlled diesel engines. It also improves the quality of crankcase oils by using modern four-cycle diesel engine tests which: operate on low- sulfur diesel fuel, as used by all on-highway trucks in the U.S., have statistically defined test limits, and are incorporated into the Chemi- cal Manufacturers Association's (CMA's) rigorous code for qualifi- cation testing. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941940. A mathematical model for the calculation of blow-by flow and oil consumption depending on ring pack dynamic, part 1: gas flows, oil scraping and ring pack dynamic. C. DeP etris, V. Giglio, and G. Police, Istituto Motori - C.N.R. In the present paper a mathematical model on ring pack behavior is presented. The program considers the aspect of gas flow into and from the inter-ring volume and the relative ring dynamic. Further- more a proper mass balance on the oil film has been considered to automatically evaluate both starvation and the oil accumulation in front of the inlet boundary of each ring. The model can give quite accurate predictions of the gas flows and the oil film thicknesses. It may be considered the first step for the simulation of oil mist for- mation and evaporation that are the most important phenomena for oil consumption prediction. 941941. Upgrading the quality of engine oils through enhanced design of combustion engines. Alexander S. Medji- bovsky and Ivan P. Ksenevitch, Engrg. Academy of USSR. The efficiency of engine oils usage depends to a great extent on stability of their service properties during operation in combustion engines. This requires that stability of their physical and chemical properties to be provided during the operation. It is well known that the change of oil properties during operation of combustion engines is a complicated tribological and chemical process accompanied by accumulation of wear debris products of partial oxidation of oils and fuels, decomposition of additives, accu- mulation of products of interaction between additives and oils, mechanical impurities, tar sediments, oxidation products of oils and sulfur components of diesel fuels, oil burning, etc. Primary measures to improve and stabilize physical and chemical indicators are oil alloying with special packet of additives ensuring a relatively low deterioration rate of oil service properties and fur- ther development of combustion engine design including filtration upgrading and hydro-acoustic dispersion. To reveal most efficient ways to improve the engine oil features the information on the effect these measures produce on the value and dynamics of engine oils service properties is required. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941942. Charles f. kettering and the development of tetra- ethyl lead in the context of alternative fuel technologies. Bill Kovarik, Radford Univ. This paper discusses the technological and public health context of the 1921 discovery and subsequent development of the anti- knock gasoline additive tetraethyl lead in light of recently released General Motors correspondence files. The discovery has long been seen as a milestone of systematic research and a vital turning point in the development of modern high compression engines. The docu- ments show that the choice of tetraethyl lead over other alternatives took place within the context of a complex controversy. After leaded gasoline entered the market in 1923-24, a fatal refin- ery accident drew attention to the poisonous nature of the full strength additive and the potential public health risk from fuel con- taining the diluted additive. Public health advocates claimed that alternatives existed, but industry insisted that tetraethyl lead was the only additive that could be used. The controversy was never resolved because, until the early 1990s, virtually no primary docu- mentary material was available in public archives. Recently released documents support the idea that the original motive for research leading to leaded gasoline was to fortify G.M. against oil shortages (then expected by the 1940s or 1950s) and raise engine compression ratios to facilitate a transition to alternative fuels (particularly ethyl alcohol). This original motive was not strong enough to shift the bal- ance toward alternative anti-knocks and was apparently discarded when oil supplies proved to be plentiful in the mid- 1920s. 941944. (SP- 1053) Round robin analysis of alcohol and car- bonyl synthetic exhaust samples. W. L. Clark, Automotive Testing Labs.; W. F. Biller, Consultant; S. B. Tejada, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; W. O. Siegl, Ford Motor Co.; D. Rosenhamer, BP Oil Co.; M. S. Newkirk, Southwest Research Institute; and R. J. Crowley, Millipore Corp. Recent changes in regulatory practices have brought about a need for speciated analysis of the volatile organic components of vehicle exhaust. The purpose of this study was to allow interested laborato- ries to participate in a Round Robin so that each could assess their speciation methodologies. "Synthetic exhaust" samples were pre- pared of mixed DNPH-carbonyl standards deposited on DNPH car- tridges, and solutions of alcohol in water. The fifteen participating laboratories included automotive, contract, petroleum and regula- tory organizations. The results described in this paper consider only 239</page><page sequence="239">941944-941950 variability associated with the analytical measurement of samples that have already been collected in impingers or on cartridges. In general, alcohols (methanol and ethanol) were quantified without difficulty. With the exception of acrolein and crotonaldehyde, the quantitation of the carbonyl samples was very good considering the variety of analytical methods that were used. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941946. (SP- 1053) Chassis test cycles for assessing emissions from heavy duty trucks. Nigel N. Clark, David L. McKain, J. Todd Messer, and Donald W. Lyons, West Virginia Univ. Recent interest in the effect of engine life on vehicle emissions, particularly those from alternately fueled engines, has led to a need to test heavy duty trucks in the field over their lifetime. West Vir- ginia University has constructed two transportable laboratories capable of measuring emissions as a vehicle is driven through a tran- sient test schedule. Although the central business district (CBD) cycle is well accepted for bus testing, no time-based schedule suited to the testing of class 8 trucks with unsynchronized transmissions is available. The Federal Test Procedure for certifying heavy duty engines can be translated with some difficulty into a flat road chassis cycle although original data clearly incorporated unpredictable braking and inclines. Two methods were attempted for this purpose, but only an energy conservation method proved practical. A chassis cycle was developed for the case of a 261 kW (350 hp) 9-speed trac- tor with a specified torque curve and rear end ratio operated at 18, 180 kg (40,000 lb.) weight. However, it evident that the range of engines and transmissions in service render a test of this type to be vehicle specific, so that a more geometric cycle, in the spirit of the CBD, was sought. Field Data show that power to weight ratios have a profound effect on vehicle emissions. A simulation including a simple shift time compensation was used to assess the acceleration ability of class 8 trucks. In addition, it is proposed that trucks be tested at 70% of gross vehicle weight (GVW) up to a GVW of 27, 270 kg (60,000 lb.) above which the testing weight should be set at 19,090 kg (42,000 lb.). The proposed cycle consists of five accelera- tions, each to a steady state speed (8.94, 11.18, 13.41, 15.64 and 17.88 m/s) (20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mph), each followed by a deceleration and an idle period. Acceleration was based on the ability of the truck to accelerate to 8.94 m/s (20 mph) in 25 sec, which test data from a chassis dynamometer show to be generous. The shape of the accel- eration curve was set using a cubic equation for velocity in time, developed from an acceleration simulation. Braking rate was set at 0.595 m/s2 (1.33 mph/sec) and the whole test was completed in 8 km (5 miles). This new test, termed the WVU 5 peak 5 mile truck cycle, is now being used in gathering data by the West Virginia Uni- versity Transportable Emissions Testing Laboratories. 941947. (SP- 1053) A non-intrusive method of measuring pcv blowby constituents. Michael E. Crane and Susumu Ariga, South- west Research Institute; and Richard Foulard and Benton Linda- mood, Ford Motor Co. A technique is presented that has been successfully demonstrated to non-intrusively and quickly sample gases typically found in PCV systems. Color Detection Tubes (CDTs) were used with a simple sampling arrangement to monitor CO2, NOx, O2, and H2Ü(g) at the closure line, crankcase, and PCV line. Measurements were accurate and could be made instantaneously. Short Path Thermal Desorbtion Tubes (SPTDTs) were used at the same engine locations for the characterization of fuel- and oil-derived hydrocarbon (HC) fractions and required only 50 cc samples. High engine loads caused pushover of blowby vapors as indicated by increased concentrations of CO2, NOx, H20(g), and fuel HCs in the engines' fresh air inlets during WOT operation. Peak concentrations of blowby vapors were mea- sured in the crankcase under no load and part throttle conditions. Oxygen concentrations always opposed the trends of CO2, NOx, and H20(g). SPTDT data revealed that the PCV system consumes approximately 100-200 times more fuel vapors than oil vapors, on a mass basis; however, PCV-derived oil consumption represented almost 12 percent of total engine oil consumption under no load conditions. 941948. (SP- 1053) Cycle resolved measurements of diesel particulate by optical techniques. F. E. Cordone and B. M. Vaglieco, Istituto Motori C.N.R. The capabilities of the spectral extinction and scattering tech- nique to follow the time history of the particulate concentration in the exhaust of a Diesel engine were evaluated. Simultaneous mea- surements of extinction and scattering coefficients from UV to visi- ble were performed at 1.5 m downstream the exhaust valve. The measurements were triggered with the exhaust valve lift. The exhaust stroke was divided in three time windows of 1 ms in which the optical signals of 100 consecutive cycles were detected. The mean diameter, the concentration and the properties of soot particles were evaluated. The cyclic variation of measurements was also esti- mated. The present paper focuses the attention on the evaluation of tran- sient capabilities and the dispersion of the measured data. Real-time measurements of scattering and extinction in the wavelength range 200 to 600 nm, synchronized with exhaust valve opening, are reported. Ensemble averaging procedure on 1ms time interval and on consecutive 100 cycles has been used to compute the scattering and extinction mean values. An estimation of data dispersion has been made at different air-fuel ratios and fixed engine speeds. 941949. (SP- 1053) Some problems in the improvement of measurement of transient emissions. C. De Pétris, S. Diana, V. Giglio, and G. Police, Istituto Motori-C. N.R. A numerical technique, aimed to the reconstruction of the analog output of an analyzer during continuous exhaust gas analysis, is presented. To this purpose the system composed by sample line and analyzer is described as a discrete Linear Time Invariant system with Finite Impulse Response. This technique has been tested on the reconstruction of the continuous emission measurements of diluted exhaust, obtained during a driving cycle acted on a chassis dyna- mometer. A comparison with the results obtained with CVS bag analysis has been made. The air/fuel ratio during the test cycle has been evaluated and compared with the signal of a oxygen sensor. An attempt to evaluate the emission indices in the transients has been also made, comparing the results of reconstructed and non- reconstructed signals. 941950. Geometry of the fuel cloud created by impingement of a diesel jet onto a small heated target. Richard A. Booth, Ford Motor Co.; and Gary L. Borman, U.W. Madison - Engine Research Center. The work presented was performed to increase the understanding of the important variables involved in the radial penetration of the droplet cloud formed by a liquid jet impinging on a target placed a short distance from the injector orifice. The experiments studied a spray produced in a high pressure, ambient temperature bomb by a Lucas CAV injector system with a Bosch pump. Three experimen- tal procedures were performed. The first experiment used a laser interrupt method to determine the radial penetration of the impinged spray. The conclusions from these tests are that the important parameters are nozzle size, impingement distance, ambient density, and target diameter. The second experiment used high speed movies to determine the droplet cloud penetration and height at discrete time steps. This experiment yielded a series of diagrams which illus- trate the development of the impinged spray. The third experiment determined the heat transfer from the heated target to the impinging liquid. The heat transfer measurements were also used to determine the total amount of thermal energy transferred into the spray. The hydrodynamic data collected are compared to two different spray correlations based on configurations different from that of the present study. These comparisons show that the configuration of the 240</page><page sequence="240">941950-941956 present study will have less radial penetration than conventional or flat plate impingement injection configurations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941951. LDA analysis of high injection pressure diesel fuel spray and entrainment air flow. Yunyi Gong and Zhijun Peng , Tianjin Univ. Droplet velocities in a diesel fuel spray before and after imping- ing on a wall as well as air movement around the spray are measured at room temperature and pressure. The range of fuel injection pres- sure is from 101 MPa to 139 MPa. The diagnostic equipment is a Laser Doppler Velocimetry with Burst Spectrum Analyzer (LDV- BSA). The results show that the droplet velocities of such a high pressure diesel fuel spray spread in a wide range (about 0-250m/s), so it is necessary to us the ensemble average for describing the velocity variation with time and space. After injection, the velocity reaches its peak value rapidly then attenuates gradually. When the spray impinges on the wall, the average velocity of the rebounded droplets is obviously reduced and the rebounded angle of most drop- lets is smaller than 30 degree when the incident angle is 70 degree. In the near field zone, the air entrainment in spray jet appears to be lower than that is gaseous one. 941952. Methods to analyze non-regulated emissions from diesel engines. G. Lepperhoff, G. Hüthwohl, and B. Liiers-Jongen, FEV Mototertechnik. Passenger cars with diesel engines have better fuel economy than cars with gasoline engines. Also diesel engines typically have lower HC and CO emissions than all but the very best, state- of-the-art gas- oline engines. On the other hand, diesel NOx and particulate emis- sions are higher, but recent developments have significantly reduced diesel particulate emissions. While the regulated emissions from both engines are well know, there are relatively few data on the non- regulated emissions for modern diesel engines. This paper describes methods developed recently to analyze the non-regulated emissions of diesel engines. Measurements of the light HC (C1-C12) and aldehydes are conducted by US Auto/Oil phase II methods. New methods were developed for particulate analyses. Soot content is detected on one filter by TGA. The sul- fates, SOF, and oil and fuel fractions of the particulates are analyzed on a second filter using a method with EEV/Biichner extraction, which is more accurate compared to known methods using Soxlet extraction. Measurements of the oil and fuel fractions are conducted by a GC method with added internal standards. The chromatogram is evaluated using a computer program calibrated with the higher boiling fuel fraction and the engine oil. A new sampling method was developed to analyze the average particulate size distribution over an emissions test cycle using an electrostatic aerosol analyzer. Detailed exhaust gas analyses using these methods were con- ducted for three passenger cars, VW Gold Eco, Audi 80 TDI and Ford Escort, and for a light duty truck, Ford Transit. The emission results from these vehicles which have different engine types are described and compared. The results demonstrate the validity of the analytical methods for these diesel vehicles. Environmental concerns are generating ever greater scrutiny of the non-regulated emissions from motor vehicles. For diesel vehi- cles, these emissions include not only gaseous components, such as aldehydes, benzene and other hydrocarbons, but also some particu- late components, such as composition and size distribution. There are several reasons for such interest. For example, the individual HC emission rates are interesting because they can now be used to esti- mate the potential of the vehicle exhaust to form ozone. The non- regulated emissions are also useful in comparing the environmental effects of different fuels, such as gasoline, reformulated gasoline, diesel and natural gas. Detailed diesel particulate analyses, which help identify the sources of the particles, such as fuel or oil, can be used to improve the engines. PAH and soot content, and particle size distribution give hints about possible health effects. This report describes several analytical methods that were recently developed to measure these non-regulated emissions. To insure the accuracy of these methods, detailed checks were made of the sample collection and preparation procedures, commercial stan- dards were used where possible, and results were checked versus other laboratories. Examples of the non-regulated emissions from four different Diesel vehicles are presented. 941953. Quantitative measurement of 2-d fuel vapor concen- tration in a transient spray via a laser-induced fluorescence technique. Chi-Nan Yeh, Takeyuki Kamimoto, Hidenori Kosaka, and Shigeharu Kobori, Tokyo Institute of Technology. A new method to determine simultaneously the temperature and the fuel vapor concentration inside an evaporating spray was described by using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. A TMPD doped based fuel composed of C12H26 • 22%, C13H28 : 54% and C14H30 : 30% was injected into the combustion chamber of a rapid compression machine which is filled with a high temperature and high pressure nitrogen. The laser sheet was used for incident light, which was reflected by a prism located inside the combustion chamber and propagated through the center of an evaporating spray. The laser induced fluorescence intensity was imaged by a high speed-gated intensifier from a direction perpendicular to the incident light. The results shows that mixtures with high equivalence ratio are observed in the central region, while low equivalence ratio mix- tures are observed in the periphery of the spray. It is also observed that the temperature of richest mixture is 50 K as low as the sur- rounding gas temperature. In this study, we propose a new method to determine simulta- neously the 2-dimensional temperature and the fuel vapor concen- tration and temperature distributions inside an evaporating spray. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941954. European diesel research idea - experimental results from di diesel engine investigations. Werner Hentschel , Klaus- Peter Schindler , and Otso Haahtele , Volkswagen AG. Within the European research program IDEA (Integrated Diesel European Action), detailed experimental and theoretical studies of the fundamental phenomena of the Diesel engine like flow, injec- tion, mixture formation, auto-ignition, combustion and pollutant for- mation were carried out to improve knowledge and to set up models for a simulation code. Because this basic research of the Diesel combustion process is very complex and cost intensive, it was carried out jointly by the JRC (Joint Research Committee), an association of European car manufacturers (Fiat, Peugeot SA, Renault, Volvo and Volkswagen). The activities were also subsized by the Commission of the Euro- pean Communities and the Swedish national Board of Technical Development. The results of the research work will support the design of even more efficient engines and the further reduction of soot and NOx emissions and will also enable the companies to reduce time and cost in developing new engines. This research work is currently being continued in the IDEA EFFECT research program which includes combustion in a gasoline engine. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941956.

A guide to measurement of flame temperature and soot concentration in diesel engines using two-color method - part 2: implementation. Nicos Ladommatos and Hua Zhao, Brunei Univ. The measurement of the instantaneous flame temperature and soot concentration in the combustion chamber of a running diesel engine can provide useful information relating to the formation of two important exhaust pollutants, NOx and particulates. The two- color method is based on optical pyrometry and it can provide esti- mates of the instantaneous flame temperature and soot concentra- tion. The theoretical basis of the method is outlined in a companion paper. This paper deals with the practical problems involved in the construction of a working system, including suitable calibration techniques. The accuracy of the measurements of flame temperature and soot concentration is also discussed using results from a various sources. 941958. Chemical modeling of hydrocarbons exhaust emis- sions. G. R. Lee and C. Morley, Shell Research Ltd. In order to estimate the influence of the fuel composition on spe- ciated hydrocarbon emissions from gasoline engines a model has been developed for the processes undergone by the fuel which escapes the main combustion event. One of the most important ways that this occurs is by trapping in crevices followed by mixing and partial oxidation with the hot burnt gas during the power and exhaust strokes. This complex process has been modeled by recog- nizing some important characteristics. It is observed that the fraction of a fuel species emitted is well correlated with its rate constant for reaction with OH radicals and that this is independent of the rest of the fuel composition. This means that (a) the chemistry is significant (not just mixing) and (b) the radicals carrying out the oxidation orig- inate from the burnt gases. The decoupling of radical concentrations from the fuel composition considerably simplifies the modeling. Using this approximation a model for the hydrocarbon oxidation has been developed with detailed chemical kinetics but simple phys- ical conditions. This correctly predicts the main partial oxidation products and the ratios of the emissions for a range of single compo- nent fuels (propane, butane, iso-octane) in both test engines and cars. A start has been made in extending this model to incorporate the time dependent temperatures, pressures and release rates of hydro- carbons from crevices. The amount of radicals present in the burnt gases, and hence the extent of hydrocarbon burnup is found to depend strongly on the amount of combustion generated NOx, which catalyses the disappearance of the radicals in the burnt gas during the power stroke. Including oxidation under higher temperature con- ditions with a correspondingly larger mole fraction of radicals leads to a better prediction of ethyne and CO. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941959. The effects of fuel preparation on hydrocarbon emis- sions of a s.i. engine operating under steady-state conditions. A. C. Alkidas, General Motors NAO Research and Development Cen- ter. This study investigated the effects of three fuel delivery systems (port fuel injection with production injectors, port fuel injection with air-assisted injectors and a premixed, prevaporized fuel system) on engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions from a four-cylinder spark ignition engine. Comparative tests were run at three part-load condi- tions and a wide range of EGR. Other engine parameters examined were intake- air and coolant temperatures, and injection timing. The observed effects of injection timing on HC emissions were related to the intake-flow events, which, in turn, affect in-cylinder fuel evaporation and combustion. The main objective of this investigation was to study the influ- ence of fuel preparation on the hydrocarbon emissions while the engine is running under steady-state conditions and normal coolant temperatures. An additional aim was to resolve some of the discrep- ancies existing in the literature, which were described earlier, on the influence of injection timing on HC emissions and to provide a mechanism for this influence. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941960. Fuel structure and the nature of engine-out emis- sions. Edward W. Kaiser, Walter O. Siegl, and Richard W. Ander- son, Ford Motor Co. For several years, a single-cylinder, spark-ignited engine without catalyst has been operated at Ford on single-component fuels that are constituents of gasoline as well as on simple fuel mixtures. This paper presents a review of these experiments as well as others perti- nent to understanding hydrocarbon emissions. The engine was run at four steady-state conditions which are typical of normal opera- tion. The fuel structure and the engine operating conditions affected both the total HC emissions and the reactivity of these emissions for forming photochemical smog in the atmosphere. These experiments identified major precursor species of the toxic HC emissions ben- zene and 1.3-butadiene to be alkylated benzenes and either straight chain terminal olefins or cyclic alkanes, respectively. In new data presented, the primary exhaust hydrocarbon species from MTBE combustion is identified as isobutene. 941961. The effect of air/fuel ratio on wide open throttle he emissions from a spark-ignition engine. Stephen G. Russ, Edward W. Kaiser, Walter O. Siegl, Diane H. Podsiadlik, and Kathy M. Bar- rett, Ford Motor Co. Currently most automotive manufacturers calibrate for rich air/ fuel ratios at wide open throttle which produces lower exhaust gas temperatures. Future federal emissions regulations may require less enrichment under these conditions. This study was undertaken to address the question of what happens to engine- out hydrocarbon emissions with different air/fuel ratios at wide open throttle. Tests were run on a single cylinder research engine with a two valve com- bustion chamber at a compression ratio of 9:1. The test matrix included three air/fuel ratios (10.5, 12.5 and 14.5) and two speeds (1500 and 3000 rpm) at wide open throttle as well as three air/fuel ratios (12.5, 14.6 and 16.5) at a part load condition (1500 rpm, 3.8 bar IMEP). The exhaust was sampled and analyzed for both total and speciated hydrocarbons. The speciation analysis provided con- centration data for hydrocarbons present in the exhaust containing twelve or fewer carbon atoms. The specific reactivity (g Ozone/g NMOG) of the exhaust was calculated for each operating condition. The results show that the total HC emissions decrease significantly with leaner air/ fuel ratios as expected. The specific reactivity of the emissions increased slightly with leaner operating conditions at both wide open throttle and part load conditions. The specific reactivity was slightly higher at wide open throttle compared to the part load condition but was not dependent on engine speed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941962. The influence of coolant temperature on unburned hydrocarbon emissions from spark ignition engine. P. Guillemot and B. Gatellier, Institut Français du Pétrole; and P. Rouveirolles, Renault S.A. A study has been initiated to understand the influence of coolant temperature on HC emissions employing a dual system cooling the cylinder head independently from the engine block. Especially, we have studied its influence on post-oxidation, fuel absorption- desorption, crevice volumes and fuel-air mixture preparation. The results show that the cylinder head temperature has more influence on HC emissions than the block temperature. It was also found that mixture preparation, absorption/desorption and crevice volumes with commercial gasoline is greatly improved by the cool- 242</page><page sequence="242">941962-941970 ing temperature. The post-oxidation process is also reduced for a decrease of the coolant temperature from 90°C to 35 °C. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941963. Novel experiment on in-cylinder desorption of fuel from the oil layer. Michael G. Norris and Simone Hochgreb , Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology. A technique has been developed to measure the desorption and subsequent oxidation of fuel in the oil layer by spiking the oil with liquid fuel and firing the engine on gaseous fuel or motoring with air. Experiments suggest that fuel desorption is not diffusion limited above 50°C and indicated that approximately two or four percent of the cylinder oil layer is fresh oil from the sump. The increase in hydrocarbon emissions is of the order of 100 ppmCl per 1% liquid fuel introduced into the fresh oil in a methane fired engine at mid- speed and light load conditions. Calculations indicate that fuel desorbing from oil is much more likely to produce hydrocarbon emissions than fuel emerging from crevices. 941965. Sources of vehicles' emissions in three-day diurnal SHED tests - Auto/oil air quality improvement research pro- gram. Robert M. Reuter, Texaco, Inc.; Jack D. ABenson, General Motors R&amp;D Center; David J. Brooks, Chrysler Corp.; Alan M. Dunker, General Motors R&amp;D Center ; Robert A. Gorse, Jr., Ford Motor Co.; and William J. Koehl, Mobil Research and Development Corp. Three-day diurnal SHED evaporative emissions were measured in a fleet of ten Auto/Oil current (1989) and two older (1984) vehi- cles using Auto/Oil Industry Average fuel. SHED temperature cycled each 24-hour period from 72 to 96F (22.2 to 35. 5C). Mea- surements included speciation of individual hydrocarbons in the SHED as well as total mass emissions at the end of each of the three 24-hour test periods. Previous evaporative emission studies provided evidence that permeate in and/or fuel seepage could contribute significantly to the mass of diurnal and hot soak emissions. Data from this investigation was used to quantify the contribution of liquid fuel to total SHED emissions during diurnal testing. A calculation method, based on the concentration of 29 select hydrocarbons in the SHED, is presented to apportion SHED emis- sions between those associated with liquid fuel losses and those associated with fuel tank head space vapor losses. The liquid fuel (seepage) contribution to SHED emissions for the 72- hour test was calculated to be 6 to 34% depending on the individual vehicle. The maximum mass of liquid fuel was about 1 lg (0.5 fluid oz.) in three days. Premeation rates of flexible fuel lines and vapor lines of four select vehicles were assessed in a separate laboratory investigation. Results indicated that permeation of fuel or fuel vapor through the hoses in three of the four cars was not a principal source of the SHED emissions. Tests of a fuel tank liquid fuel line of the fourth vehicle indicated that permeation could have accounted for about 40% of the seepage rate calculated for that vehicle. 941966. Auto-oil program phase II heavy hydrocarbon study: analysis of engine-out hydrocarbon emissions data. Wai K. Cheng, Simone Hochgreb, Michael G. Norris, and Kuo-Chun Wu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The engine-out (EO) total and speciated hydrocarbon emissions data from the Auto-Oil Program Phase II Heavy Hydrocarbon Study had been analyzed. The methodology was to first investigate the sta- bilized EO emissions (Bag2) of a specific vehicle (Vehicle 04B, a 1989 Model Year Ford Taurus); then the vehicle-to-vehicle differ- ences in Bag2 emissions were considered. Finally, the differences in the Bag2 and the starting/warm-up EO emissions (Bagl) were examined. The speciated emissions may be interpreted as a "feed- through" part due to the unreacted fuel species, and an "offset" part due to the decomposition products. The significant non-fuel emitted species were methane and the olefins. The HC emissions for vehicles with different total emissions were similar in species com- position. For both the total and speciated emissions, there was no substantial difference between the Bagl and Bag2 values for Vehi- cle 04B. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941969. Emissions with reformulated gasoline and methanol blends in 1992 and 1993 model year vehicles. Vaughn R. Burns, Chrysler Corp.; William J. Koehl, Mobil R &amp; D; Jack D. Benson, General Motors R &amp; D; Robert A. Gorse, Ford Motor Co.; and James A. Rutherford, Chevron Research &amp; Technology. Exhaust and hot soak evaporative emissions were measured in a fleet of 1993 production flexible/variable-fueled vehicles on meth- anol fuels blended with a reformulated gasoline. A fleet of 1993 Cal- ifornia Tier 1 gasoline vehicles was also tested on the same reformu- lated gasoline blended to meet the specifications of California Phase 2 fuel. Ozone-forming reactivity, expressed as reactivity weighted emissions and specific reactivity, was calculated using 1991 SAPRC and 1994 CBM MIR and MOR factors. Within the FFV/VFV fleet, FTP exhaust and reactivity weighted emissions were significantly lower by 18 to 32% with Phase 2 gasoline relative to industry aver- age gasoline. With the exception of greater NMOG emissions with the M85 blends, and lower OMHCE emissions with M85 blended with industry average gasoline, exhaust organic emissions, CO and NOx with the methanol fuels were not significantly different than their base gasolines. M85 reactivity weighted emissions were, how- ever, significantly lower by 25 to 32% than industry average gaso- line but were not significantly different from Phase 2 gasoline using both photochemical mechanisms and reactivity scales. Exhaust spe- cific reactivity was significantly lower by 50 to 55% for the M85 blends relative to gasoline, and by 6% to 8% for Phase 2 gasoline relative to industry average gasoline. With respect to EPA designated toxic air pollutants, benzene and 1,3-butadiene were significantly lower by 44 to 80% with Phase 2 gasoline relative to industry average and with the M85 blends rela- tive to their base gasolines. Formaldehyde increased ten-fold with M85 fuels relative to base gasolines. Lower benzene and 1,3- butadiene emissions drove aggregate toxics significantly lower by 40% with Phase 2 gasoline relative to industry average, while the increase in formaldehyde drove M85 aggregate toxics significantly greater by 57 to 146% relative to the gasolines. Hot soak evaporative organic emissions were marginally lower with Phase 2 gasoline relative to industry average, but were greater with the M10 and M85 blends relative to gasoline. Hot soak benzene tracked fuel benzene levels and was also lower with Phase 2 gaso- line and the M85 blends. Hot soak evaporative reactivity weighted emissions were not significantly different for any of the fuel com- parisons, although hot soak specific reactivity was significantly lower by 26 to 49% with both photochemical mechanisms and reac- tivity scales for the methanol blends relative to gasoline. Exhaust emissions and ozone-forming reactivity in the 1993 FFV/VFV fleet were nearly equivalent to the levels reported for the 1993 California Tier 1 gasoline fleet with Phase 2 gasoline. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941970. Auto-oil program phase II heavy hydrocarbon study: fuel species oxidation chemistry and its relationship to the auto-oil data. Wai K. Cheng, Simone Hochgreb, Michael G. Norris, and Kuo-Chun Wu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The oxidation chemistry of paraffins, aromatics, olefins and MTBE were examined. Detailed chemical kinetics calculations were carried out for oxidation of these compounds in the engine cycle. The oxidation rates are very sensitive to temperature. At tempera- tures of over 1400 K (depending on the fuel), all the hydrocarbons are essentially oxidated for typical residence time in the engine. Based on the kinetics calculations, a threshold temperature is defined for the conversion of the fuel species to CO, CO:, H2O and partially oxidized products. The difference in the survival fraction 243</page><page sequence="243">941970-941978 between aromatics and non-aromatics is attributed to the higher threshold temperature of the aromatics. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941972. A comparison of total and speciated hydrocarbon emissions from an engine run on two different california phase 2 reformulated gasolines. W. O. Siegl, E. W. Kaiser, D. H. Pod- siadlik, S. Russ, and K. M. Barrett, Ford Motor Co. New regulations from the state of California have established, for the first time, reactivity-based exhaust emissions standards for new vehicles and require that any clean alternative fuels needed by these vehicles be made available. Contained in these regulations are pro- visions for 4 'reactivity adjustment factors" which will provide credit for vehicles which run on reformulated gasoline. The question arises: given two fuels of different chemical composition, but both meeting the criteria for CA Phase 2 gasoline (reformulated gaso- line), how different might the specific reactivity of the exhaust hydrocarbons be? In this study we explored this question by examin- ing the engine-out HC emissions from a single-cylinder version of the 5.4 L modular truck engine run on two different CA Phase 2 fuels. The results were for steady-state operation under five different operating conditions: world wide mapping point (1500 rpm, MBT, 3.8 bar IMEP) at three fuel/air equivalence ratios = 0.9, 1 .0, 1.1 5); a retarded spark timing (MBT - 12°) at = 0.9; and a higher speed (2500 rpm, MBT, 4.14 bar IMEP) at = 0.9. This matrix was designed to test a variety of operating conditions that may be encountered in actual vehicle use. Both fuels were run at least twice at each operating condition. The exhaust was sampled and analyzed for both total and speciated hydrocarbons. MTBE was also mea- sured, but no analyses were carried out for other oxygenated organic compounds. For each sample the specific reactivity of the exhaust was calculated. Based on these engine-out exhaust emissions data, the specific reactivities of the non-methane hydrocarbon emissions from the two California Phase 2 certification fuels are identical to within our estimated statistical uncertainty of 1-2% for all 5 engine operating conditions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941973. Reformulated gasoline effects on exhaust emissions: phase I: initial investigation of oxygenate, volatility, distillation and sulfur effects. Stephen C. Mayotte, Christian E. Lindhjem, Venkatesh Rao, and Michael S. Sklar, United States Environmental Protection Agency. This study was the first of three EPA studies to investigate the effect of gasoline fuel parameters on hydrocarbon, nonmethane hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides, benzene, formaldehyde, and acetalde- hyde exhaust emissions of 1990 model year or equivalent vehicles. The fuel parameters tested in this program were oxygen concentra- tion, Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), ninety percent evaporative distil- lation temperature (T90), and sulfur concentration. Sulfur concen- tration was found to have the greatest effect on hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions. Increasing oxygen concentration and RVP reduction was found to reduce hydrocarbon emission more for high- emitting than normal- emitting vehicles. Oxygenate concentration was found to have a significant effect on aldehyde emissions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941974. Reformulated gasoline effects on exhaust emissions: phase II: continued investigation of the effects of fuel oxygenate content, oxygenate type, volatility, sulfur, olefins and distillation parameters. Stephen C. Mayotte, Christian E. Lindhjem, Venkatesh Rao, and Michael S. Sklar, United States Environmental Protection Agency. This study is the second in a series of three EPA studies to inves- tigate the effect of fuel reformulations and modifications on exhaust emissions. Both the first and second study in this series of studies were used to support the development of EPA' s complex model for the certification of reformulated gasolines. Phase I of the study tested eight fuels on forty vehicles. This study, termed Phase II, tested twelve fuels on a separate fleet of 39 light-duty vehicles. The Phase II fuel parameters studied included Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), the 50% and 90% evaporated distillation temperatures (T50 and T90), sulfur content, aromatics content, olefin content, oxygen- ate type and oxygen content. Measured exhaust emissions included total hydrocarbons (THC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon mon- oxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), benzene, 1,3-butadiene, acetal- dehyde and formaldehyde. Oxygen, aromatics and olefins were found to have the greatest influence on determining THC emissions while sulfur and T90 were found to have the greatest influence on NOx emissions. For benzene emissions, the aromatics and benzene content of the fuel were found to be the key parameters. For the other measured exhaust emissions, no single fuel parameter was seen to stand out as being the key parameter in determining emissions performance. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941976. (SP- 1055) Assessment of the low-temperature incom- patibility risk of commercial engine oils. R. B. Rhodes, Shell Development Co. A portion of the Institute of Materials database which contained data on more than 650 multigrade oils was searched to obtain an estimate of the percentage of oils that meet SAE J300 low- temperature pumpability requirements but exhibit properties which make the low-temperature properties suspect. The suspect oils stud- ied either failed the Scanning Brookfield test (SBT) or produced sig- nificantly different viscosities in the one-day mini- rotary viscome- ter (MRV) test and the two-day MRV test, which commercial multi- grade oils were obtained from the Institute of Materials (IOM). The oils were then blended with off-the-shelf commercial (CO- numbered) oils having the same SAE W-grade designation and eval- uated in the two-day MRV test (TP 1 -MRV), which has been a reli- able predictor of engine lubricant pumpability characteristics. A number of failures were recorded and some of the off-the-shelf oils were found to be more likely to fail than others. The low-temperature rheology of the IOM-supplied oils identi- fied them as being suspect formulations. In this report they are referred to as rheospecific formulations. Conversely, the rheology was not suspect for the majority of CO-numbered oils that were incompatible in the TP 1 -MRV with the IOM-supplied oils. Such oils are identified herein as rheolatent formulations; they have good low-temperature performance in themselves, but are victimized when combined with the rheospecific blends. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941977. (SP- 1055) Rheological properties of engine crankcase and gear oil components in elastohydrodynamic oil films. A. J. Moore, D. Cooper, and T. M. Robinson, BP Oil Technology Center. Techniques are described by which the response of viscosity to both pressure and shear may be determined from measurements of elastohydrodynamic oil film thickness. The methods are applied to three aspects of lubricant behavior. The response of viscosity to pressure is first determined for a range of mineral, hydrocracked, polyalphaolefin and ester base stocks. Changes in this property when a dispersant/inhibitor additive package is introduced are then examined to determine whether relationships can be established between base oil and solution properties. A relatively simple out- come would allow the properties of commercial lubricants to be esti- mated from a much narrower range of base oil data. Finally, the response of a polymeric viscosity modifiers to the high shear regime of the elastohydrodynamic inlet zone is investigated. The behavior of the polymer is shown to depend on the relationship between poly- mer and base oil compositions. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941978.

Firmstone, and Jitendra A. Patel, Texaco Research and Development Department. 244</page><page sequence="244">941978-941983 In 1993, a Presidential Executive Order was issued requiring that federal agencies purchase lubricants containing at least 25% re-fined base oil. In light of this initiative, we have undertaken a program to characterize the chemical composition of re-fined base stocks, provided by a number of manufacturers, using column chromatogra- phy coupled with mass spectrometry techniques. The hydrocarbon- type distribution observed for the re-fined oils provides an index of their relative quality when benchmarked against conventionally pro- cessed 4 'virgin" and certain non-conventional, high viscosity index (VI) base oils. Using statistical models which can predict lubricant performance in the ASTM Sequence VE and HIE Gasoline Engine Tests from base oil compositional features and VI, it was deter- mined that highly paraffmic synthetic and non-conventional base oils provide enhanced performance while re-refined oils generally exhibit predicted behavior comparable to an "average" "virgin" base oil, for most commercially available products. Sequence VE and HIE test parameter predictions were found to be especially sen- sitive to the thioaromatic and multiring aromatic content of the base oil under evaluation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941979. (SP- 1055) Oil activity surface concept on the study of zddp-basestock type binary systems. Hector J. Franco, Cruz R. Cabrera, and Nobis Torres, INTEVEP, S.A. The oil activity surface (OAS), which is a 3D plot of the effective oil adsorption energy as a function of the estimated contact tempera- ture and load, is used as a methodology to study the performance of two ZDDP antiwear additives. The paper presents a boundary lubrication model which permits evaluation of the adsorption energy of a binary lubricant system. Binary oil system performance was studied by determining the adsorption energy with respect to that of the base oil alone and measuring the wear rate inside the experimen- tal operation condition space defined for the entire test set. The adsorption energy depends on the composition of the film formed from ZDDPs, oil temperature, applied load and basestock nature. This is a measure of the degradation of ZDDPs and can be associ- ated depending on base oil, with the antiwear performance of ZDDPs. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941980. (SP- 1055) Evaluation of reversible and irreversible viscosity losses using the viscosity loss trapezoid. Wilfried Bartz, Technische Akademie Esslingen. In order to realize a less pronounced viscosity-temperature- behavior of multi-grade oils, viscosity index improvers are often used. These are macro-polymeric additives which in oils lead to non-Newtonian flow behavior, on the one hand, and to a certain degree of shear instability, on the other. The completely formulated oil will suffer reversible and irreversible viscosity losses if shear stresses are applied. The level of these viscosity losses can be regarded as a distinctive feature, sometimes even as a quality char- acteristic of polymer containing oils. In order to describe the extent of these viscosity losses, SELBY proposes a graphic method which results in a so-called viscosity loss trapezoid. In this paper, the method is described and its applicability is discussed using model oils and commercially available multigrade engine oils. 941981. (SP- 1055) The influence of lubricant rheology on friction in the piston ring-pack. R. I. Taylor, M. A. Brown, D. M. Thompson, and J. C. Bell, Shell Research Ltd. A piston ring-pack lubrication model has been developed which takes into account both lubricant viscosity/temperature and viscosi- ty/shear rate variations. In addition, lubricant starvation of the upper piston rings, due to restriction of the oil supply by the lower rings, has been included. Inputs to the model include piston ring profiles (measured using Talysurf profilometry) and gas pressure distribu- tions throughout the ring- pack. The latter were calculated using the (known) combustion chamber pressure diagram at the relevant engine operating conditions. The model was validated by comparing predicted oil film thick- nesses with those measured using a laser-induced fluorescence tech- nique on a Caterpillar- 1Y73 single-cylinder diesel engine. The engine was run at a range of speeds with two different, fully formu- lated, multigrade lubricants, and the oil film thickness under each of the piston rings was measured. Good agreement was found between measured and predicted oil film thicknesses, although lubricant shear thinning effects had to be included to obtain satisfac- tory agreement for the top compression ring. Following validation, the lubrication model was used to predict frictional losses in a diesel engine, for a range of lubricant rheological properties. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941982. (SP- 1055) The use of radioactive tracer technology in studying lubricant chemistry to enhance bearing and ring wear control in an operating engine. Martin B. Treuhaft, Frank A. Iddings, and Glen A. Boyd, Southwest Research Institute; and Stan R. Sprague, Petrolon Technologies, Inc. Radioactive tracer technology (RAT) is an important tool in mea- suring component wear in an operating engine on a real-time basis. This paper will discuss the use of RAT to study and evaluate bound- ary lubricant and surfactant chemistries aimed at providing benefits in wear control. In particular, RAT was employed to study ring and bearing wear as a function of engine operating condition (Speed, load, and temperature) and lubricant characteristics. Prior to testing, the engine's compression rings and connecting rod bearings were subjected to bulk thermal neutron bombardment in a nuclear reactor to produce artificial radioisotopes that were separately characteristic of the ring and bearing wear surfaces. The irradiated parts were installed in the test engine, after which testing to a specific test matrix was accomplished. During testing, these radioisotopes acted as detectable tracers as irradiated wear particles abraded from the rings and bearings and circulated in the lubrication system. Radia- tion associated with these particles was measured by a gamma ray spectrometer; the amount of radioactivity present being proportional to the number and mass of wear particles in the oil at the time of measurement. Thus, the radiation measurements were directly pro- portional to the amount of ring and bearing wear during a given test period. With this technology, it was possible to measure ring and bearing wear simultaneously, in real-time, without disassembling the engine for inspection. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941983. (SP- 1055) Engine durability, emissions and fuel economy studies with special boundary lubricant chemistry. Harold Shaub, John Pandosh, Anne Searle, and Stan Sprague, Petrolon Technologies, Inc.; and Martin Treuhaft, Southwest Research Institute. A unique combination of boundary lubricant and surfactant chemistries has produced significant benefits in ring and bearing wear control. This chemistry is added as an engine treatment to cur- rent quality engine lubricants. Microscopic wear studies employing radioactive tracer and metal surface analysis techniques have helped define optimum chemistry for enhanced bearing and ring wear con- trol in a running engine. These studies have also served to further our understanding of the wear protection mechanism. Results from macroscopic engine wear studies, carried out in Sequence HIE engines/stands using modified ASTM HIE protocols, paralleled data obtained from the radioactive wear studies. They confirmed the pos- itive wear protection benefits of this unique chemistry. Vehicle emission evaluations using the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) for light duty vehicles with this unique chemistry showed no detrimen- tal effects either as added pollutants or catalyst degradation. Initial fuel economy data have also indicated a substantial benefit for this chemistry, especially under engine conditions emphasizing bound- ary lubrication. The paper will describe and discuss the test methods employed in evaluating this unique chemistry and the relevance of the resulting data to improved engine durability, emissions and fuel economy. 245</page><page sequence="245">941984-941990 941984. (SP- 1055) Cavitation thresholds of engine oils as functions of temperature and frequency. Allen H. Meitzler and Brian C. Shu, Ford Motor Co. Cavitation thresholds of 5W30 and 10W30 oils were measured in laboratory experiments using electrically-driven disks of piezo- electric ceramic as sources of mechanical excitation. The technique allows the mechanical-wave power density at which cavitation begins to be observed and calculated from electrical quantities and the volume of the oil sample being tested. Both cavitation turn-on and turn-off thresholds have been measured as functions of tempera- ture and frequency. The temperatures ranged from 20 to 100°C and the frequencies ranged from 50kHz to 4MHz. The experiments have shown these oils can be made to undergo cavitation at surprisingly low thresholds. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941985. (SP- 1055) Nanohardness and fuel pomp brush/ commutator wear. D. Scholl, E. M. Clausing, P. A. Willermet, and S. C. White, Ford Motor Co. Nanohardness measurements performed in an SFM (Scanning Force Microscope) are compared with macrohardness data obtained by conventional means. Nanohardness provides detailed informa- tion about material hardness on a sub-micron length scale, contribut- ing valuable insights on commutator and brush wear on a fuel pomp wear simulation test. For a commutator material consisting of a harder component dispersed in a softer matrix, nanohardness mea- surements show the hardness of both components. The observed rates of brush wear cannot be explained satisfactorily without this additional nanoscale information. SFM nanohardness measurements are expected to prove useful in a variety of tribological systems. 941986. (SP- 1055) 1.81 sierra-mondeo turbo-diesel valvetrain friction reduction using a solid film lubricant. V. D. N. Rao and H. A. Cikánek, Ford Motor Co. A 1.8L turbocharged diesel engine valvetrain friction was inves- tigated, and the effectiveness of using a solid film lubricant (SFL) coating in reducing friction was determined throughout the operable speed range. This valvetrain design features direct acting mechani- cal bucket valve lifters. Cam shaft journal bearing surfaces and all camshaft rubbing surfaces except lobe tips were coated. The direct acting bucket shims were etched with a cross hatch pattern to a depth sufficient to sustain a SFL film coating on the shim rubbing surfaces subjected to high surface loads. The SFL coated valvetrain torque was evaluated and compared with uncoated baseline torque. Coating the cam bearing journal surfaces alone with II-25D SFL reduced valvetrain friction losses 8 to 17% for 250 to 2000 rpm cam speed range (i.e. 500 - 4000 rpm engine speed). When bucket tappet and shims were also coated with the SFL, further significant reductions in coated valvetrain friction were observed. These reductions in fric- tion ranged from 14.4% to 35% for camshaft speeds of 250 to 2000 rom. Limited durability tests showed that the II-25D SFL impreg- nated to a depth of 20 microns will provide 3000 hours or more of service life. 941987. Flame shape determination using an optical-fiber spark plug and a head-gasket ionization probe. Olivier P. Salvai, P.S. A. Peugeot Citroen ; and Aldebert S. Cheng, Wai K. Cheng, and John B. Hey wood, Sloan Automotive Lab.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A method for determining the flame contour based on the flame arrival time at the fiber optic (FO) spark plug and at the head gasket ionization probe (IP) locations has been developed. The experimen- tal data were generated in a single-cylinder Ricardo Hydra spark- ignition engine. The head gasket IP, constructed from a double- sided copper-clad circuit board, detects the flame arrival time at eight equally spaced locations at the top of the cylinder liner. Three other IP's were also installed in the cylinder head to provide addi- tional intermediate data on flame location and arrival time. The FO spark plug consists of a standard spark plug with eight symmetri- cally spaced optical fibers located in the ground casing of the plug. The cylinder pressure was recorded simultaneously with the eleven IP signals and the eight optical signals using a high-speed PC-based data acquisition system. Based on these flame arrival times, the development of the flame radius in each direction from the center of the spark plug toward each head gasket IP (Ri=f(time)) was estimated using a cubic spline interpolation. The flame contour for a given time is then drawn from a spline interpolation. The engine was run at various spark timing settings, speeds, and relative air-fuel ratios for two distinct flow con- figurations. This curve fitting methodology produces reasonable flame contours and therefore provides a useful tool for studying cycle-to-cycle variations in the combustion rate as well as the effect of different flow characteristics on flame development and end-gas region geometry and location. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941988. A new approach of planar laser induced fluorescence applied to fuel/air ratio measurement in the compression stroke of an optical s.i. engine. J. Reboux and D. Puechberty, URA CNRS; and F. Dionnet, CĒRTAM - Université de Rouen. The aim of this work is to provide a new tool for quantitative measurements of the fuel/air ratio in the combustion chamber of a spark ignition engine. This optical method is based on a new approach of Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence, taking advantage of the quenching phenomenon. A broadband KrF excimer laser (248 nm) induces the fluorescence of toluene to visualize the fuel / distri- bution. At first, we made a spectroscopic study of the mixture iso- octane toluene in a cell. At last, in an SI engine equipped with opti- cal access, instantaneous imaging of the fuel/air ratio was performed inside the cylinder during the compression stroke. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941989. Fuel droplets inside a firing spark-ignition engine. M. Posylkin and A. M. K. P. Taylor, Imperial College of Science, Tech- nology and Medicine; F. Vannobel, P. S.A. Peugeot Citroen ; and J. H. Whitelaw, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medi- cine. Experiments have been performed in one cylinder of a produc- tion two-valve engine under firing conditions and quantify the velocity, size and number density of droplets as a function of posi- tion, crank angle, injection timing, rotational speed, load and cool- ing water temperature. They were obtained with a phase-Doppler velocimeter with measurements ensembled in relation to an optical shaft encoder. The engine was also instrumented to provide pressure traces, air and fuel flow rates and temperatures. The injection tim- ings included those with open and closed inlet valve. The results show that most of the droplets emerge in a compara- tively small region of the inlet valve and that the characteristics of the spray are important mainly when injection takes place with the inlet valve open. Injection against a closed valve can lead to few droplets when the injection takes place many crank-angle degrees before valve opening and to large droplets when there is insufficient time for evaporation but sufficient for the formation of liquid films on the surfaces of the port/valve assembly. Increase in the speed of the engine led to faster and larger droplets as the time for evapora- tion was reduced. The number of droplets increased with manifold pressure but the droplet sizes were little affected. The effect of the temperature of the cooling water was small. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941990.

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) associ- ated to cross-correlation algorithm was used to provide evolution of a two dimensional velocity vectors map in the engine in presence of flame propagation. Laser tomography by means of quantitative Mie diffusion was applied to study the mean and the RMS- fluctuations of the nonhomogeneous mixture created in the cham- ber. Measurements have been performed with and without turbu- lence (the mixing being homogeneous or not) for statistical sets of digitized images. First results are presented here. 941991. Combustion imaging in engine using electrical impedance measurements. C. M. Beck, Shell Research Ltd.; and R. He, R. C. Waterfall, and M. S. Beck, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. This paper describes how the image of a flame within an enclo- sure can be reconstructed from multiple measurements of capacitive impedance, between non-intrusive sensing electrodes distributed around the combustion zone. Measurements across the combustion zone respond to the ionization inherent in the combustion process, which changes the permittivity and hence the capacitance measured between electrodes. For this feasibility study, experimental data is presented from a laboratory analogue of an engine combustion chamber, demonstrating flames being imaged in real time. The sens- ing system is modeled using 3-D finite element methods, enabling analysis of practical electrode geometries for engine combustion chambers. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941992. Multiple laser sheet imaging investigation of turbu- lent flame structure in a spark ignition engine. R. A. Hicks, M. Lawes, C. G. W. Sheppard, and B. J. Whitaker, University of Leeds. A range of multiple and sequential Mie scattering imaging tech- niques have been employed to investigate turbulent flame propaga- tion in a relatively quiescent optically accesses two- stroke spark ignition engine. Flame structure and turbulence scales have been characterized by a number of methods. These include fractal analy- sis, simple flame perimeter to area ratios and techniques based on Fourier analysis of an independent stationary coordinate. From this was derived an integral scale of flame wrinkling and a parameter related to turbulent flame thickness. Fully developed values of these turbulence parameters proved independent of cyclic variation, mix- ture strength and (apart from increasing flame thickness) apparent flame extinction. Islands of unburned gas behind the flame front were associated with encirclement by large scale structures than par- tial quench or total quenching due to flame stretch. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941993. Effect of flow and gasoline stratification on combus- tion in a 4-valve SI engine. Bétrice Deschamps, Ray Snyder, and Thierry A. Baritaud, Institut Francais du Pétrole. In a 4-valve SI engine, various levels of gasoline stratification and bulk flows were achieved by modifying the intake configuration and injection mode. Mean flow and turbulence were evaluated with laser doppler velocimetry. Planar laser induced fluorescence on a gasoline doped with a tracer was used to characterize the equiva- lence ratio field while the pressure traces were simultaneously acquired. Very positive effects of the elevation of tumble levels on combustion speed were observed. The possibility of stratifying the mixture was assessed. An excellent correlation was observed between local equivalence ratio, and early heat release and total burn duration. With highly stratified gasoline distributions, an improve- ment of combustion behavior was obtained when ignition was in the richer region. By combining high tumble level and strong gasoline stratification, it was possible to improve remarkably, initiation and propagation speeds while reducing cyclic variations, especially in the case of lean or very lean combustion. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941994. HC-emissions of si engines - optical investigation of flame propagations in piston top land crevice. J. Sterlepper and H. -J. Neuber, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH and Co. KG; and H. Ruhland, Institute for Applied Thermodynamics; Aachen Technical Univ. The subject of this paper is quenching effects in the piston top land crevice of a SI engine. The influence of this crevice geometry on HC-emissions and on flame propagation phenomena into this area is examined using the multi optical-fiber measurement tech- nique. Examinations of HC-emission and flame propagations into the piston top land crevice have been carried out during transient engine operation as well as warm steady state running conditions. These results will be presented and the observed phenomena will be dis- cussed in detail. The possibility to reduce raw emissions by varying the piston crown geometry will be proved. An estimation of the potential for a reduction of hydrocarbon ran emissions will be given in order to enable development engineers to reduce the pollutant emissions of SI engines with higher efficiency. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941995. A novel automobile preheating system for cold starts. Matthew A. Martson, Steven Armstrong, and Ioannis N. Miaoulis, Tufts Univ. An automobile preheating system which can improve automobile performance, reduce emission levels, and enhance passenger com- fort during a cold start was developed. This system utilizes heat from the exhaust of the automobile which would otherwise be wasted into the environment. Thermal energy from the exhaust is stored during engine operation in the form of chemical energy through the dehydration of lithium bromide. This energy can be stored indefinitely with no insulation and be recovered through the re-hydration of the lithium bromide. Upon hydration, heat is evolved which can be used for various preheating functions prior to a vehicle cold start. When required, the thermal battery could be used to i) increase passenger comfort and safety by heating the cabin and defrosting the windshield, ii) improve engine performance and lower pollutant emission levels by heating the engine and catalytic converter, and iii) increase the cranking power of the battery by rais- ing its temperature. A prototype of the thermal battery was designed, constructed and tested. Experiments verified the feasibility of such a system. 941996. (SP- 1053) Alternative ehe heating patterns and their impact on cold- start emissions performance. Joseph E. Kubsh, W. R. Grace and Co. EHC heating patterns which utilize zones covering less than the available inlet face cross-sectional area have been evaluated for cold-start FTP performance. Both NMHC and CO cold-start emis- sion performance were found to be significantly reduced relative to an EHC-inactive base case for heating patterns that covered as little as 44% of the cross-section. In low-mileage tests, NMHC and CO cold-start emission dependencies on heating patterns were found to be relatively constant for patterns with heating coverages of 44% or more of the inlet face cross- sectional area. In these low mileage tests, reductions in Bag 1 FTP NMHC and CO emissions averaged about 30% lower with the preferred zoned heating patterns relative to the EHC-inactive base case. FTP tests run on a similar engine- aged EHC showed less asymptotic dependence on EHC zoned heat- ing strategies. Improvements in cold-start NMHC and CO perfor- mance were observed for heating patterns as zoned heating cover- ages increased from 44% to 89% of the available inlet cross- sectional area. Electrically heated catalytic converter (EHC) technology received attention in the late 1980s in response to initiatives by the EPA and CARB aimed at reducing cold-start vehicle emissions. First generation EHC prototypes demonstrated significant reduc- tions in cold-start hydrocarbon and CO emissions in low-mileage FTP evaluations, but were characterized by large power demands of 247</page><page sequence="247">941996-942001 5 kW or more (1-3). More recently EHC electrical energy demands have been significantly reduced by reductions in EHC mass (4-6). These low-mass EHCs have also been combined with small volume, unheated metal or ceramic-based converter functions in either cas- cade or fully integrated single- core designs to provide additional cold-start emission reduction benefits (5-9). Low-power EHC designs have allowed for substantial simplification of EHC system characteristics (and in- turn system costs) including operation with a single battery or direct connection to a vehicle alternator (6, 9, 10). Cascade arrangements that combine heated and unheated core func- tions take advantage of the "ignitor" characteristics of the EHC. In this scheme the EHC quickly reaches catalytically active tempera- tures and serves to initiate the oxidation reactions in the exhaust stream shortly after engine start. The combustion energy released from these oxidation reactions is then efficiently transferred to the unheated core function in order to accelerate its warm-up. This cas- cade arrangement quickly provides for sufficient active catalyst area to cope with the initial high exhaust flows encountered during the first acceleration of the FTP driving cycle. In a recent paper authored by Toyota(l 1), this EHC ignitor func- tion was taken one step further by considering designs in which only portions of the EHC cross-section were electrically heated. Reduc- tions in EHC energy demand were realized with this approach while still maintaining high cold-start emission reduction efficiencies. Here again the success of this concept relied on the initiation of combustion reactions within the heated zones of the EHC and the transfer of the combustion energy to both unheated regions of the EHC and a downstream, unheated light-off converter. In the work presented here, a closer look is given to the concept of partial cross- sectional heating of the EHC as a means of reducing EHC energy demands. A specially designed EHC prototype that includes provi- sions for electrically heating various extents of the EHC cross- section has been evaluated in both low-mileage and simulated high- mileage conditions using the FTP driving cycle. The impact of vari- ous ''zoned" EHC heating patterns on cold-start emission perfor- mance is presented and discussed below. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941997. (SP- 1053) A novel approach to studying the effect of various rapid aging cycles on the performance of a high-tech, palladium-only, three- way catalyst. S. V. Kumar, J. K. Hochmuth, and R. M. Heck, Engelhard Corp. A new technique has been developed to assess the deterioration of hydrocarbon lightoff during FTP Phase 1. This method maps the dynamic real-time data onto the hydrocarbon conversion/gas phase temperature plane to show the instantaneous hydrocarbon activity as a function of the exhaust temperature. Clearly, the map exhibits an apparent hysteresis bifurcation. The bifurcation is thought to be predominantly related to catalyst surface temperature. The hystere- sis envelope of the map expands with aging severity. Therefore, the map can be used as a measure of catalyst deactivation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941998. (SP- 1053) Thermal analysis and testing of a vacuum insulated catalytic converter. Steven D. Burch, Matthew A. Keyser, Thomas F. Potter, and David K. Benson, National Renew- able Energy Lab. Based on a recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study, about 95% of all trips start after a cold-soak period of 16 hours or less. By preserving the heat in the catalyst between trips, exhaust gases could be processed without warm-up delay and with- out the usual cold-start emissions. Vacuum insulation and phase- change thermal storage have been incorporated into a catalytic con- verter design to enhance its heat-retention time. Laboratory testing of a bench-scale prototype showed that a "light off" temperature (above 350°C) could be maintained during a 10-hour cold soak. Design improvements currently being tested should increase this heat-retention time to more than 1 6 hours. The thermal conductance of the vacuum insulation will be made continuously variable to pre- vent overheating and excessive thermal cycling. This approach to thermal management may be more durable and less costly than quick-heat methods using electric or fuel-fired preheat catalysts. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 941999. (SP- 1053) Measurements of total and speciated hydrocarbon removal from engine exhaust using activated car- bon. James D. Pakko, Andrew A. Adamczyk, Walter O. Siegl, and Robert J. Pawłowicz, Ford Motor Co. A hydrocarbon trapping system for cold start emissions was con- structed and tested using two types of carbonaceous adsorbents pro- vided by Corning, Inc. One was made by combining activated car- bon with an organic binder and extruding it into a honeycomb, and the other by depositing a carbon coating on a ceramic monolith. The tests were carried out on an engine in a dynamometer laboratory to characterize the performance of the carbon elements under transient cold start conditions. Performance was evaluated by continuously measuring exhaust gas hydrocarbon concentrations upstream and downstream of the trap, using conventional emissions consoles. Samples were also collected for off-line analysis of individual hydrocarbon species using gas chromatography to examine differ- ences in adsorption of individual species. The speciated hydrocar- bon data were used to distinguish between the mass trapping effi- ciency and a reactivity-based trapping efficiency of the adsorbent traps. Trap performance was investigated using both a 91 RON base gasoline and a California reformulated fuel. The two carbon adsor- bents were found to have similar abilities to collect total hydrocar- bons, with the carbon coated monolith achieving somewhat higher efficiencies, presumably due to its greater geometric surface area. The traps differed in their ability to release adsorbed hydrocarbons when treated with a heated air purge. The tolerance to higher tem- perature of the carbon coated monolith sample could be exploited for more efficient purging of the trap using a stream of heated air. Speciation of samples collected before and after the traps revealed that high molecular weight hydrocarbons were trapped very effi- ciently, while low molecular weight species were not. Because atmospheric reactivity varies among hydrocarbons, reactivity trap- ping efficiency differed from mass trapping efficiency. The results obtained illustrate the effect that fuel selection has when determin- ing the mass- and reactivity-based trapping efficiency of cold trap adsorbents. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942000. (SP- 1053) A lubricant formulation for lower unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. P. Beckwith and J. H. Cooper, BP Oil. Engine-out emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons from spark igni- tion engines are attributable to a number of mechanisms, occurring during the engine cycle, by which fuel escapes combustion. These include absorption of fuel components into the bore lubricating oil film during compression, and subsequent desorption into hot com- bustion gases throughout expansion. A proportion of the hydrocar- bons desorbed will then be emitted, either as unburnt or partially oxidized fuel. This mechanism has been studies by a number of workers, and estimates of its importance vary from 10 to 30% of total hydrocarbons being related to the absorption/desorption pro- cess. A novel lubricant additive has been formulated for the purpose of reducing the quantity of fuel which is absorbed into the bore lubricant film, and hence the quantity of fuel subsequently desorbed. This paper describes a program to evaluate the effect that this lubri- cant additive can have on engine-out emissions from a single cylin- der research engine, together with results from current technology, low-emitting US and European vehicles, tested over FTP and ECE drive cycles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942001. IM240 emission test with a 2.2L Corsica TLEV. Donald D. Beck, General Motors Research and Development Cen- ter; William A. Short, General Motors Powertrain Division; Timo- thy E. Angelos, Failure Analysis Associates ; and Ray R. Dils, Seki- denko. 248</page><page sequence="248">942001-942006 The following study was performed to investigate the in-use emissions performance of a California TLEV equipped with compo- nents aged in customer service on an enhanced I/M test. Fuels and ambient temperature conditions were chosen to compare I/M test conditions typical for California (moderate temperature on Califor- nia Phase II gasoline) to those likely to be encountered in a North- eastern state (cold temperature on winter grade fuel). To obtain repeatable results and simulate typical customer driving prior to the test, Bag II of the FTP schedule was used to simulate urban driving to an I/M lane, followed by a variable length idle to simulate waiting for the I/M test, followed by the IM240 test. For a given idle period prior to the test, we found that the IM240 tailpipe emissions were dramatically increased using cold conditions and federal winter reg- ular unleaded grade fuels with higher sulfur levels as compared with similar tests in warm conditions using a California Phase II reformu- lated fuel. The magnitudes of the emission increases measured for this particular vehicle are far greater than the average increases pre- dicted by EPA models. Since the most strict emission standards for enhanced I/M can be based on these models, our results suggest that this vehicle would likely pass the most strict I/M TLEV cutpoints under conditions expected for California, but would surely fail the most strict I/M TLEV standards under conditions expected outside California. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942002. (SP- 1053) Oxidation catalyst systems for emission control of lpg-powered forklift trucks. W. Addy Majewski , Edward P. Martin , and Edward Pietrasz , Diesel Controls Ltd. An oxidation catalyst was installed on an industrial LPG- pow- ered forklift truck. For high conversion efficiency in an oxidation system on a rich burning engine a secondary air supply to the cata- lyst is necessary. Two simple and cost-effective ways of secondary air supply were tested: an air valve and a venturi type injector. The amount of secondary air supplied by both devices was measured under a variety of conditions-different engine speed, load and exhaust system pressure. Carbon monoxide emissions and the catalyst performance were measured and evaluated in terms of the secondary air flow. Advantages and drawbacks of the air valve and venturi injector systems are discussed and compared. 942003. (SP- 1052) Turbocharging a bi-fuel engine for perfor- mance equivalent to gasoline. Christopher J. Tennant, Richard J. Atkinson, Michael L. Traver, Christopher M. Atkinson, and Nigel N. Clark, West Virginia Univ. A bi-fuel engine capable of operating either on compressed natu- ral gas (CNG) or gasoline is being developed for the transition to alternative fuel usage. A Saturn 1.9 liter 4- cylinder engine was selected as a base powerplant. A control system that allows closed- loop optimization of both fuel delivery and spark timing was devel- oped. Stock performance and emissions of the engine, as well as performance and emissions with the new controller on gasoline and CNG, have been documented. CNG operation in an engine designed for gasoline results in power loss because of the lower volumetric efficiency with gaseous fuel use, yet such an engine does not take advantage of the higher knock resistance of CNG. It is the goal of this research to use the knock resistance of CNG to recover the asso- ciated power loss. The two methods considered for this include tur- bocharging with a variable boost wastegate and raising the compres- sion ratio while employing variable valve timing. For the first method, which is the subject of this paper, a turbocharger was installed to increase the density of the intake charge and thereby regain the volumetric efficiency lost with CNG. The wastegate was electronically controlled to allow precise control of the engine per- formance. Equivalent power to gasoline operation with CNG was achieved with the turbocharger. It was necessary to bypass the tur- bocharger during gasoline operation, on both the inlet and exhaust sides, to avoid knock. Reductions from baseline in hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were achieved at power levels equivalent to and slightly higher than the baseline. Brake ther- mal efficiency values were not significantly different in any case. 942004. (SP- 1052) A controller for a spark ignition engine with bi-fuel capability. Richard J. Atkinson, Christopher J. Ten- nant, Michael L. Traver, Christopher M. Atkinson, and Nigel N. Clark, West Virginia Univ. A bifuel engine with the ability to run optimally on both com- pressed natural gas (CNG) and gasoline is being developed. Such bi-fuel automotive engines are necessary to bridge the gap between gasoline and natural gas as an alternative fuel while natural gas fuel- ing stations are not yet common enough to make a dedicated natural gas vehicle practical. As an example of modern progressive engine design, a Saturn 1.9 liter 4-cylinder dual overhead cam (DOHC) engine has been selected as a base powerplant for this development. Many previous natural gas conversions have made compromises in engine control strategies, including mapped open-loop methods, or resorting to translating the signals to or from the original controller. The engine control system described here, however, employs adap- tive closed-loop control, optimizing fuel delivery and spark timing for both fuels. Each fuel is metered by solenoid injectors and the fuel injection control maintains a preset air-fuel ratio using a universal exhaust gas oxygen sensor (UEGO). Spark timing is controlled to maintain the location of peak in-cylinder pressure at the optimum value for best torque, which was determined experimentally to be 14° after top dead center for this engine. In-cylinder pressure was measured in the experimental engine using piezoelectric pressure transducers flush-mounted in the cylinder head. Location of peak pressure was determined in real time with the IBM-compatible 486 computer used for control, and was used to modify the spark advance for the next engine event in that cylinder. Reductions in engine-out emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen, as compared with stock operation, were observed when using the controller with gasoline. Further reductions in emissions were achieved with CNG operation, due to the properties of the fuel. An improvement in engine stability was also realized with the con- troller. 942005. (SP- 1052) Experimental studies on a natural gas vehicle. Mitsunori Ishii, Shizuo Ishizawa, Eiji Inada, Ryuichi Idoguchi, and Toru Sekiba, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper presents the results of several studies conducted on a natural gas vehicle. In one study of engine-out emissions perfor- mance, the exhaust emissions of the CNG engine were lower than those of the base gasoline engine. In another study of the conversion characteristics of three-way catalysts, it was found that the conver- sion efficiency of total hydrocarbons (THCs) was much lower in the lean-mixture region for the NGV. The reduced efficiency was traced to lower conversion and poor reactivity of low-end hydrocarbons and to a higher concentration of H2O. 942006. (SP- 1052) Examination of charge dilution with egr to reduce nox emissions from a natural gas-fueled 16 valve dohc four-cylinder engine. Hannu E. Jääskeläinen and James S. Wal- lace, University of Toronto. Charge dilution is commonly used to reduce emissions of nitro- gen oxides (NOx) from internal combustion engine exhaust gas. The question of whether to use air or exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as a charge diluent for the natural gas- fueled test engine is addressed first. The decision to use EGR is based on the potentially lower NOx and unburned hydrocarbon emissions that could be achieved if a three-way catalyst were applied to the engine. The effect of EGR on the spark advance for maximum brake torque (MBT), NOx, and unburned hydrocarbon emissions is then exam- ined in detail. The effect of fuel efficiency is discussed briefly. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 249</page><page sequence="249">942007-942013 942007. (SP- 1052) Operating parameter effects on the sped- ateci hydrocarbon emissions from a natural gas fueled engine. J. H. Poulsen and J. S. Wallace, University of Toronto. The effects of engine operating parameters on the speciated engine-out hydrocarbon emissions from a natural gas fueled spark ignition 16 valve four-cylinder engine were examined. Total hydro- carbon emissions were dominated by methane, the main component of natural gas. The non-methane hydrocarbons consisted primarily of ethane, ethane, and acetylene. Except for changes in the fuel-air equivalence ratio rich of the stoichiometric condition, emissions of unsaturated species were found to be less sensitive to engine operat- ing parameters than were the fuel components. A single species, eth- ane, dominated the engine-out hydrocarbon reactivity, accounting for over 80% of the NMHC reactivity. 942008. (SP- 1052) Characteristics of formaldehyde forma- tion from catalytic reaction of methane in the presence of no. Byung-Chul Choi, Institute for Advanced Engineering; and Takayuki Sakai, Japan Automobile Research Institute. Experiments have been conducted to investigate the inhibitory effect of the catalytic reaction of methane and the formation of formaldehyde in the presence of NO. With precious metal catalysts, the presence of NO showed an inhibitory effect on the methane oxi- dation and caused the formation of formaldehyde. In the absence of oxygen, however, formaldehyde was not produced in the catalytic reaction of methane and NO. Maximum formation of formaldehyde was about 0.6% of NO with the Pt and Rh series catalysts. N2O for- mation is similar to the formaldehyde formation from the catalytic oxidation of methane in the presence of NO. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942009. (SP- 1056) Determination of dyes in diesel fuels. Edward G. Sweeney and Carolyn H. Schmidt, AutoResearch Labs., Inc.; Al Zimin and Peter A. Caputo, Morton International, Inc.; and Paul M. Anderson, Marathon Oil Co. On November 24, 1993, the Internal Revenue Service issued a "Notice of Proposed Rule Making" relating taxation of on-road diesel fuels and policing by means of a dyeing program. Based on the proposed regulation, various qualitative and quantitative meth- ods were developed by two laboratories to identify and determine concentration of various dyes in No. 1 and No. 2 diesel fuels. A sim- ple qualitative method was devised which consists of extracting the dye out of the fuel and identifying dye composition by thin layer chromatography. Quantitative methods were also developed based on spectrophometric evaluation of dyed fuel. The quantitative meth- ods are designed for use with low cost single beam spectropho- meters. Independent results based on a nine terminal sampling pro- gram are included. 942010. (SP- 1056) Diesel fuel detergent additive performance and assessment. M. W. Vincent, M. J. Papachristos, D. Williams, and J. Burton, Associated Octel Co., Ltd. Diesel fuel detergent additives are increasingly linked with high quality automotive diesel fuels. Both in Europe and in the USA, field problems associated with fuel injector coking or fouling have been experienced. In Europe indirect injection (IDI) light duty engines used in passenger cars were affected, while in the USA, a direct injection (DI) engine in heavy duty truck applications experi- enced field problems. In both cases, a fuel additive detergent perfor- mance test has evolved using an engine linked with the original field problem, although engine design modifications employed by the manufacturers have ensured improved operation in service. Increasing awareness of the potential for injector nozzle coking to cause deterioration in engine performance is coupled with a need to meet ever more stringent exhaust emissions legislation. These two requirements indicate that the use of detergency additives will continue to be associated with high quality diesel fuels. The paper examines detergency performance evaluated in a range of IDI and DI engines and correlates performance in the two most widely rec- ognized test engines, namely the Peugeot 1.9 litre IDI, and Cum- mins LIO DI engines. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942011. (SP- 1056) The influence of surfactants on diesel water shedding properties. K. J. McCarthy, T. J. O 'Brien, and J. J. Weers, Petrolite Corp. The properties of emulsions formed when water contacts low sul- fur diesel fuel supplemented with indigenous surfactants or chemi- cal additives was studied. Small amounts of the additives were found to have dramatic effects on the stabilization or breaking of the emulsions formed during ASTM D- 1094 testing. Dynamic interfa- cial tension measurements were also recorded to determine the influence of the surfactants on the interfacial film surrounding the water droplets in the emulsions. The results of both the ASTM test and the interfacial tension measurements were compared. 942012. (SP- 1056) A chassis dynamometer study of the effects of ago detergent and ignition improver on vehicle fuel consump- tion. K. Reading and T. M. Evans, Shell Research Ltd. The benefits of diesel fuel additives have been demonstrated in a broad range of performance and operational areas, from the refin- ery, through storage and distribution, to fuel dispensing and vehicle operation. The customer is certainly aware of their effects on fuel performance in many of these respects, such as cold- weather opera- tion, ease of starting, foaming, odor, etc. An area of particular inter- est in customer perception, however, is fuel economy. Excluding the use of after-market ftiel-treatment devices, it is claimed that addi- tives of different types can improve fuel economy, for example by improving combustion, by maintaining injection equipment in opti- mum condition, or by reducing engine frictional losses. Although the effects of fuel type and additives on vehicle emissions have been studies, the effects on fuel economy are notoriously difficult to mea- sure with precision, with the statistically most reliable data coming from extended fleet trials under closely controlled conditions. It was therefore the object of this study to devise a method to measure the effects of individual additives on fuel economy, at conditions repre- sentative of urban driving conditions, and to make preliminary mea- surements of the effects of a detergent and ignition improver. In this study, a vehicle was prepared and run on a chassis dyna- mometer under steady-state urban cruise conditions according to a specially designed procedure. A range of standard nozzle fouling values was established by using selected fuel/detergent additive combinations. At each nozzle fouling level, repeated gravimetric measurements were taken of fuel consumption and emissions levels of CO, NOx and particulates. At a selected nozzle fouling level, fuel dosed with ignition improver was also used to give a direct compari- son between the two additive functions. The results show that benefits in fuel economy can be gained both by using detergents - in avoiding the build-up of excessive noz- zle fouling and maintaining fuel injection equipment close to its design conditions - and also by using ignition improver. Changes in emissions consistent with previous studies were noted in both cases. 942013. (SP- 1056) Survey of winter '93 low sulfur diesel fuels in the u.s. C. M. Cusano, R. W. Flaherty, and A. N. Roush, Cummins Engine Co. Reports of disabling diesel engine seal failures which accompa- nied the introduction of low sulfur diesel fuel in October '93 prompted an indepth survey of diesel fuel chemical and physical properties. The purpose of the survey was to anticipate other possi- ble problems which might arise with the newly introduced low sul- fur fuels. The survey will produce a database containing over 1000 number 2 diesel fuels from various parts of the US. about 75% of the samples testes were on-highway low sulfur diesel fuels. Samples analyzed were from the D-A Lubricant Company, Cummins cus- tomers failures (truck fleets of various sizes), and a number of retail fueling stations.

Diesel fuel speciation was helpful in providing an understanding of many of the differences noted for low sulfur fuels. 942014. Diesel fuel lubricity additive study. Manuch Nikanjam and Eric Burk, Chevron Research and Technology Co. The trend toward low environmental impact diesel fuel has resulted in new formulations that not only benefit the environment, but that can enhance diesel engine performance as well. The sulfur content of highway diesel fuel has been reduced to a maximum of 0.05 wt% nationwide. California has an additional requirement of a maximum of 10% aromatics content which covers most highway and non-highway vehicles. However, fuels with higher aromatics levels can be certified if they demonstrate equivalent emission. The introduction of these new fuels, coupled with the rapid changes in engine design to meet new emission regulations, has cre- ated the need to evaluate a number of fuel properties to ensure proper performance while protecting certain engine components. Diesel fuel lubricity and its effect on some fuel injection system equipment, such as rotary distributor pumps, is one such issue which is being investigated by a number of groups. Many fuel additive suppliers have introduced diesel fuel lubricity additives for fuel producers who may need to improve the lubricity of their fuels. The U.S. Army Modified Ball-on- Cylinder Lubricity Evaluator (BOCLE) test method, as well as the standard version of this tests, were used to evaluate the performance of several fuels and several additives at two concentrations. Fuels with various lubricity levels were included. Some additives and components, which may be used by the fuel users in the field, were also tested. The modified BOCLE test is a useful tool for classification of unadditized fuels and perhaps highly additized fuels. However, the method does not seem to be as useful, in its present form, for additive evaluation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942015. (SP- 1056) The lubricity requirement of low sulfur diesel fuels. J. C. Wang and D. J. Reynolds, Cummins Engine Co. An engine rig test and a scuffing BOCLE test have been used to investigate the lubricity of low sulfur diesel fuels and its relationship with unit injector wear in heavy duty diesel engines. The rig test effectively ranks 1 1 selected fuels/fluids according to their actual performance. The scuffing BOCLE test correlates with the rig test by showing the same ranking capability, and it is easy to perform. A similar correlation has been established using ISO reference fuels. The scuffing BOCLE test has been used to study 37 fuels randomly sampled from the field. The data shows that there is indeed a reduc- tion in lubricity of low sulfur fuels. The variation in lubricity of low sulfur fuels is also much grater than high sulfur fuels. Data in this study shows that transition from good to poor lubricity usually occurs between 2500 to 3000 grams in the scuffing BOCLE. This study was performed to identify a test procedure that could best characterize lubricity of diesel fuels by establishing a correla- tion with engine tests and field experiences, and to propose a mini- mum lubricity requirement based on this test. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942016.

Wolveridge, Shell Research Ltd.; K. J. Rivers, Shell International Petroleum Co., Ltd.; and A. Ubbens, Svenska Shell A.B. Environmentally adapted diesel fuels defined by the Swedish Government Contain extremely low levels of sulfur and have lim- ited aromatics contents. Road trials and pump durability tests of these fuels revealed unacceptable wear in injection pumps due to low lubricity. Additive solutions were identified using bench tests and then proven in field trials. Market experience has substantiated the findings that fuels using the chosen additive give fully satisfac- tory performance. This paper illustrates how practical solutions to lubricity ques- tions can be found, and is applicable wherever specifications demand fuels requiring a high degree of hydroprocessing. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942017.

Reports of disabling elastomer seal failures across a wide range of diesel equipment, which accompanied the introduction of low sulfur diesel fuel in October '93 prompted an in-depth investigation of low sulfur diesel fuel chemical speciation. The objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of how low sulfur fuels had changes to cause this problem. Mass Spectroscopy (MS) and seal swell data were obtained on a broad geographical sampling of low sulfur diesel fuels obtained during the 4th quarter of '93. Previously available high sulfur (0.25%) data were available for comparison. Elastomer seal swell data were obtained in pure component blends and also in fuels which has caused field failures. Using these data it was possible to determine which fuel components or lack thereof may contribute most heavily to seal swell failures. Further, compres- sion set data were obtained for a number of commonly used fuel sys- tem elastomers in a fuel which caused field problems. The role of peroxides in degrading elastomer compression set was not investi- gated. 942018. (SP- 1056) Effect of automotive gas oil composition on elastomer behavior. S. D. Robertson, D. R. Price, and P. E. Wolveridge, Shell Research Ltd.; H. C. Grigg, D. Holmes, and M. R. West, Lucas Industries PLC; and R. J. Butterfield, and G. Stew- art, Freudenberg Technical Products LP. Significant differences have been observed in the behavior of elastomeric seals exposed to various automotive diesel fuels. This behavior is governed not only by the chemistry of the elastomer but also by the aromatic content of the fuel and is typical of elastomer/ fluid interactions occurring under diffusion control. Although no significant differences were observed in the response of nitrile elastomers exposed to peroxides, the use of anti- oxidant additives in "low" aromatic diesel fuel needs to be consid- ered. The normal seal housing design criterion is such that seal integ- rity should not be compromised by the use of "low" aromatic fuels in normal operating circumstances. Some three years' experience in the Swedish market supports this view. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942019. (SP- 1056) The performance of a peroxide-based cetane improvement additive in different diesel fuels. Manish K. Nandi, David C. Jacobs, Frank J. Liotta, Jr., and H. S. Kesling, Jr., ARCO Chemical Co. The implementation of stringent diesel engine emissions regula- tions is growing worldwide. The sue of high cetane diesel fuels is a cost-effective option that can be used to reduce engine emissions. A direct comparison of heavy-duty diesel engine emissions for three different low sulfur diesel fuels treated with di-t-butyl perox- ide and 2-ethylhexyl nitrate, at the same cetane level, were evalu- ated. Both the peroxide and the nitrate cetane improvement additive significantly reduced all regulated and unregulated emissions including the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission. Di- t-butyl perox- ide shows a small advantage over ethylhexyl nitrate in reducing NOx in all the three fuels. Compatibility of the peroxide and the nitrate additives, when mixed in a fuel blend, has been demonstrated by cetane response and engine emissions for the fuel blend. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942020.

Gondal, Indian Institute of Petroleum. 251</page><page sequence="251">942020-942025 Injector nozzles of direct injection diesel engines (DI) of in- service vehicles showed one or more holes blocked and significant flow reduction even in nozzles with all the holes open. Coked noz- zles from field gave measurable increase in smoke, carbo monoxide (CO) emissions and specific fuel consumption (BSFC). Tests of 500 hour duration on a naturally aspirated DI diesel engine revealed hardly any significant nozzle coking particularly with the fuels containing total cycle oil (TCO). In some cases, an increase in flow rates in nozzles was observed for in-service vehi- cles as well as in 500 hour engine tests. In the long duration tests, statistically significant increase only in CO and reduction in NOx emissions were observed with a straight run diesel fuel and another fuel containing 20% TCO. Change in power, BSFC and HC emis- sions during 500 hour engine operation were not significant with any of the test fuels. Cetane number in the range of 45-48 was observed to give minimum smoke and gaseous emissions. Smoke and CO emissions generally, decreased with decrease in fuel viscos- ity. 942021. (SP- 1056) The particulate number: a diesel engine test method to characterize a fuel's tendency to form particu- lates. L. Forti and X. Montagne, Institut Français du Pétrole ; P. Marez, Peugeot S.A.; and J. P. Pouille, Renault S.A. A new criterion to assess diesel fuels has been developed at the Institut Français du Pétrole, in collaboration with PEUGEOT and RENAULT. It is a comparative method which makes it possible to assign a Particulate Number (PN) to a diesel fuel, calibrated, as for the cetane number, with two reference fuels specially formulated. One has a low emission level, the other one a very high level. Values PN=0 and PN=100 are respectively attributed to each of them. The first is made up of tetradecane, and the second of the highly aromatic mixture containing 55% tetradecane, 40% 1 -methyl-naphthalene and 5% phenanthrene. The PN value of a diesel fuel derives from measurements of particulate emissions of an engine successively fueled with the three products (CPP) and from a simple analysis in laboratory of the nitrogen content (N) of the tested fuel. The relation can be equated as follows: PN = CPP + 4.5e (°015 N). Validation work, undertaken on 5 cars and 2 sets of respectively 10 and 12 spe- cially formulated diesel fuels, has shown that the PN index corre- lates well with the particulate emissions measured on vehicles dur- ing European standard test. These experiments show that this crite- rion could become a good predictive tool for particulate emissions. 942022. (SP- 1056) Fuel quality effects on particulate matter emissions from light- and heavy-duty diesel engines. C. J. J. Den Ouden, R. H. Clark, L. T. Cowley, and R. J. Stradling, Shell Research Ltd.; W. W. Lange, Deutsche Shell AG; and C. Maillard, Shell Recherche. As a result of increasing concerns over air quality, environmental legislation has led to more stringent emissions limits for diesel engines and vehicles. This has affected both engine manufactures and fuel suppliers. Whereas in the US, only the fuel requirements for heavy-duty diesel engines are of key interest, in Europe light- duty diesel applications are also important since diesel-powered passenger vehicles are accepted by customers and their market pene- tration has increased rapidly. This paper gives an update of Shell's ongoing research on corre- lations between diesel fuel quality and particulate emissions in both heavy- and light-duty applications. In heavy-duty testing (both steady-state and transient), sulphur is the dominant fuel properly affecting particulate emissions. After sulfur correction, fuel effects are small and can best be described by a combination of cetane number and density. In steady-state testing, cetane number effects are more consistent whereas the role of den- sity is dependent on engine technology. In transient testing, the key fuel property after sulphur correction is density. In light-duty testing, particulate emissions from no-catalyst vehi- cles are best described by a non-linear density function. For catalyst vehicles, fuel quality effects are much less pronounced and, in con- trast with their no-catalyst counterparts, there is no single fuel prop- erty which adequately describes particulate emissions. An exhaust oxidation catalyst selectively decreases the particu- late hydrocarbon fraction, leaving the fixed carbon fraction unaf- fected. This overall particulates reduction mechanism explains why particulate emissions from catalyst vehicles are less sensitive towards changes in fuel quality. An attempt has been made to explain the differences observed between particulate emissions from heavy- and light-duty engines. It is tentatively concluded that differences originate mainly from intrinsic differences between the heavy- and light-duty test cycles. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942023. (SP- 1056) Effects of oxygenated fuel and cetane improver on exhaust emission from heavy-duty di diesel engines. Yukio Akasaka and Yoshihito Sakurai, JOMO Technical Research Center Co., Ltd. Smoke emission from single-cylinder DI and IDI diesel engines was shown to strongly depend on oxygen content in fuel regardless of oxygenate molecular structure. Thus, with cetane improver and oxygenate used in combination in a proportion determined from blending properties and potential cost for modern heavy-duty DI diesel engines were assessed. The combined use of nitrate type cetane improver with glycol ether type oxygenate reduced particu- late, HC, and CO emission but not that of NOx. Particulate reduction depended on oxygenate content. Oxygenate at less than 5% with cetane improver seldom worsened volume-based fuel economy compared with the base hydrocarbon fuel. 942024. (SP- 1055) Mechanical degradation of multigrade oils in laboratory engine tests. Alan Flamberg and Robert D. Koller, Rohm and Haas Co.; and Jean-Luc Herbeaux and William E. VanArsdale, University of Houston. Eight SAE 10W-30 oils were formulated with different viscosity index (VI) improvers and used in single and multi-cylinder engines. A significant number of measurements were made during each engine test to accurately determine changes in kinematic viscosity with time. These measured values appear to decay logarithmically over a large portion of each test. This behavior is qualitatively simi- lar to results reported in other engine tests involving multigrade oils. A coefficient in the data correlation is suggested as a measure of engine severity for a particular formulation, this coefficient and the shear stability index are used to monitor severity changes during the test period. These changes are correlated to an increase in ring gap and a decrease in ring mass for the single cylinder engine. A proce- dure is suggested for extrapolating severity measures to a value rep- resentative of the initial engine configuration. While the ratio of these initial values is nearly constant for fired engine tests, poor cor- relation is obtained between fired and motored tests on the same engine. Bench tests based on an ultrasonic oscillator and the Bosch diesel injector correlate poorly with all engine tests. 942025. (SP- 1055) Predicting viscosity-shear relationships of VI improved lubricants. C. I. Chen, P. Wu, J. L. Duda, and E. E. Klaus, Pennsylvania State Univ. The majority of crankcase lubricants are now formulatedto con- tain polymeric additives to improve the viscosity temperature prop- erties to provide a better lubricating film in the various bearing sys- tems in an internal combustion engine. These VI (viscosity index) improved lubricants are non-Newtonian under high shear conditions that exist in most automotive bearing systems. The conditions of interest range from starting the engine at temperatures of as low as -40°C to operating the engine at normal operating conditions includ- ing bearing temperatures of 150°C or higher. This paper presents a method for predicting the viscosity shear relationship for a series of SAE multigrade engine oils as a function of temperature and shear stress. The method is demonstrated using three types of polymeric VI improvers currently used in SAE multigrade engine oils.

(SP- 1055) First in-situ measurement of lubricant degradation in the ring pack of a running engine. S. R. Nattrass, D. M. Thompson, and H. McCann, Shell Research Ltd. Mid-infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy, has been applied for the first time to the measurement of lubricant degrada- tion products in the ring pack of a firing single- cylinder, IDI diesel. An IR-transmitting window, mounted in the cylinder wall, enables illumination of the moving piston by a broadband IR source located on the engine exterior. Light reflected from the piston is ana- lyzed in three wave bands to measure carbonyl oxidation products and oil volumes. Intra-cycle observations reveal differences in the apparent extent of lubricant oxidation between strokes and at different spatial loca- tions in the ring pack. The data are interpreted in terms of a non- homogeneous sample. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942027. (SP- 1055) Mechanisms of engine wear and engine oil degradation in vehicles using m85 or gasoline. Shirley E. Sch- wartz and Chris J. Mettrick, General Motors. The results of several investigations indicate the extent to which driving cycle, oil formulation, and fuel type (either regular unleaded gasoline or M85) influence the nature and severity of engine-oil degradation and engine damage. Driving cycle greatly influenced mass loss of piston rings and main and connecting rod bearings. For example, short-trip, cold start service with M85 caused 80 times more wear of top piston rings per km of service than was observed in long-trip service with the same oil. The magnitude of engine oil degradation was also documented. Under freeway driving condi- tions, in which the engine oil warmed completely, service with M85 fuel caused approximately the same amount of oil degradation as was found with gasoline. In city service, several engine oil parame- ters (base number, accumulation of insoluble contaminants, viscos- ity) degraded twice as fast with gasoline as with M85. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942028.

A vehicle system to monitor the actual condition of engine oil in service would provide the customer with the opportunity to utilize the full useful life of the oil and would minimize problems which can occur when oils remain in the engine too long and are exces- sively degraded and/or contaminated. This paper describes limita- tions of some systems which have been proposed, outlines the requirements and potential difficulties related to development of sensors designed to monitor changes in chemical properties of the oil, and describes laboratory and vehicle evaluations of a candidate sensor. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942029. (SP- 1055) Monitoring moisture and wear particles in pag and poe synthetic lubricants for r-134a compressors using portable oil analyzer. Ray Garvey, Computational Systems Inc.; and Chimere C.N. Obioha, Ford Motor Co. Polyalkelene glycols, or PAG, and polyol esters, or POE, are two synthetic lubricants commonly used in refrigerant compressors. They are both hygroscopic. Moisture which is picked up can lead to chemically weakened load bearing surfaces and to corrosion, thereby accelerating mechanical wear. PAG and POE lubricant samples having from 0.00% to 1.28% water were tested using a portable oil analyzer. Minimum detecti- bility was found to begin at 0.04% (400ppm) moisture. Increasing amounts of moisture above this amount yielded proportional output response. Additional samples were contaminated with known con- centrations of metal particles representative of common wear debris. Minimum detectability was found to begin at approximately 15 ppm for 4 to 6 micron size iron particles and &lt;100 ppm for 0 to 60 micron size tin particles. 942030. (SP- 1055) Infrared absorptivities of several diesel engine soots; applications to the analysis of soot in used engine oils. P. R. Rayason, M. J. Hillyer, and T. P. Hansen, Chevron Research and Technology Co. Soot was recovered from end-of-test (EOT) oils from several dif- ferent Diesel engines. After resuspending the recovered soots in fresh high dispersancy engine oil, the infrared absorptivities of the soots were determined over a range of frequencies. On the basis of a statistical analysis of the data, recommended 1870 cm'u+1 absorp- tivities for soots from various engine tests are: GM 6.2 L, Mack T-8, Cummins L-10 HST, 59.0±0.5; GM 6.2L, Mack T-8, Caterpillar 3176, 0.02% sulfur fuel and 0.2% sulfur fuel, 56.7±0.3; Caterpillar 3116, 53.3±0.4 and OM 602A, 47.8±0.2. In all cases, the units for the absorptivity are cm2/centigram. Over the range of 3800 cm"1, the dependence of absorptivity on frequency was linear for all the soots. Use of these absorptivities to determine soot concentration in used engine oils is discussed. Of particular concern are the procedures required to obtain reproducible results. Special care must be taken to assure compositional uniformity of samples. 942032. (SP- 1055) Impact of electric mobile oil refiners on reducing engine and hydraulic equipment wear and eliminating environmentally dangerous waste oil. Byron Lefebvre, TF Puri- finer, Inc. An improved electric mobile oil refiner which, can be mounted on any engine or hydraulic equipment has been developed to elimi- nate oil changes and extend the useful life of equipment. The author plans to show how the use of the refiner, a filter crusher and a batch refiner which recycles the oil extracted from the crushed filters, starts a cycle that can eliminate waste oil. If the use of this type of equipment is implemented on a large scale, it will result in a positive impact on the environment which can help alleviate the pollution problems created by the indiscriminate disposal waste oil. Use of these devices should appeal to all segments of Government, private industry, environmental groups and private individuals, because it could save substantial amounts of money in maintenance and equip- ment, protect the environment, and conserve a precious natural resource, oil. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the capa- bilities of electric mobile oil refiner after aver ten years of field and laboratory testing. It will also present the concept of filter crushers and portable batch refiners, which when used in conjunction with refiners, will benefit the environment. This paper will also outline the laboratory and field testing of electric mobile oil refiners on truck fleets, hydraulic equipment, marine engines and industrial engines in use for thousands of hours or have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles or kilometers demonstrating the refiners ability to prolong equipment life while saving maintenance dollars and improving the environment through the elimination of extension of oil drain intervals. 942033. (SP- 1057) Experimental study on unsteady gas jet Hideaki Tanabe and G. Takeshi Sato, Kanazawa Institute of Tech- nology. In order to clarify the mixture formation process of the direct injection gas engine, helium gas was injected into a quiescent atmo- sphere. The time- and space-resolved velocity, pressure and concen- tration distributions were measured in the free unsteady gas jet and in the wall impinging unsteady gas jet. They were also obtained for the unsteady gas jet impinging onto a projection on a wall to enhance mixture formation. Empirical equations for the unsteady free jet were obtained, and the mixture formation mechanism of the wall impinging unsteady gas jet were clarified.

(SP- 1057) Natural gas autoignition under diesel con- ditions: experiments and chemical kinetic modeling. Jeffrey D. Naber and Dennis L. Siebers, Sandia national Labs.; Jerry A. Caton, Texas A and M Univ.; Charles K. Westbrook, Lawrence Liv- ermore National Lab.; and Shoeleh S. Di Julio, California State Univ. The effects of ambient gas thermodynamic state and fuel compo- sition on the autoignition of natural gas under direct- injection diesel conditions were studied experimentally in a constant- volume com- bustion vessel and computationally using a detailed chemical kinetic model. Natural gas compositions representative of variations observed across the U.S. were considered. These results extend pre- vious observations to more realistic natural gas compositions and a wider range of thermodynamic states that include the top-dead- center conditions in the natural gas version of the 6V-92 engine being developed by Detroit Diesel Corporation. At temperatures less than 1200 K, the experiments demonstrated that the ignition delay of natural gas under diesel conditions has a dependence on temperature that is Arrhenius in character and a dependence on pressure that is close to first order. The Arrhenius temperature dependence agrees with observations previously reported for natural gas and well-established trends for conventional diesel fuels. Natural gas composition did not change the nature of the above dependencies but did affect the magnitude of the ignition delay. The measured ignition delays were longest for pure methane and became progressively shorter as ethane and propane concentra- tions increased. At higher ambient temperatures (&gt; 1300 K), the experimental ignition delays approached a limiting value that was consistent with physical delays associated with the injection system. The trends with regard to composition and pressure discussed above were in agreement with trends predicted with a detailed chemical kinetic model. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942035. (SP- 1057) Study on mechanism of backfire in hydro- gen engines. Katsuyoski Koyanagi, Masaru Hiruma, and Shouichi Furuhama, Musashi Institute of Technology. In this study, the cause of backfire concerning an external mix- ture formation type hydrogen engine was clarified. It has been known that the maximum output power of the external mixture for- mation type hydrogen engine should be kept significantly low, because of backfire. Generally, the backfire of this type of hydrogen engine is caused by pre-ignition. In this type of hydrogen engine, pre-ignition occurred for a range of lean mixture. Under this study, therefore, the relationship between the occurrence of backfire and the temperature at the tip of the spark plug electrode, and the detec- tion of the luminescence spectrum of the flame near the spark plug were examined and studied in relation to the spark plug ignition the- ory which appeared to be promising. Then the pre-ignition timing and location were studied by detecting the flame luminescence spec- trum. An attempt was also made to clarify the mechanism of pre- ignition that would cause the backfire, by photographing the pre- ignition by means of a high-speed video camera. Judging from these results, it was found that the slight reaction of combustion remaining in the piston top land was the cause of pre- ignition. 942036. (SP- 1057) Cycle-resolved hydrogen flame speed mea- surements with high speed schlieren technique in a hydrogen direct injection si engine. F. Meier, J. Köhler, W. Stolz , and W. H. Bloss, University of Stuttgart; and M. Al-Garni, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. The influence of internal mixture formation on hydrogen com- bustion in a SI engine was investigated using high speed Schlieren photography. To this end a computer controlled high pressure injec- tion system for direct injection of gaseous hydrogen was developed. The injection system for hydrogen direct injection consists of an electronic control unit, a solenoid valve and a purpose developed injector. The timing and the duration of the hydrogen injection are controlled by an electronic unit. The fuel-air ratio was varied by adjusting the opening time of the solenoid valve. The hydrogen was fed into the combustion chamber of the engine with a pressure of 6.0 MPa. With this injection system and injection pressure it is pos- sible to inject the hydrogen into the combustion chamber of the engine even during hydrogen combustion. In order to compare the results of internal mixture formation, experiments with external mixture formation were also performed. Internal mixture formation showed distinct advantages compared to external mixture formation. Engine operation could be achieved with fuel-air ratios up to 0=1.0. The flame speeds obtained with internal mixture formation were significantly higher. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942037. (SP- 1057) Influence of preheat temperature on the laminar burning velocity of methane-air mixtures. Osamu Kurata, Sanyo Takahashi, and Yoshitada Uchiyama, Mechanical Engineering Lab. The influence of preheat temperature on methane-air laminar burning velocity was investigated with a burner tube technique. The measurements were made by varying preheat temperature from 30°C to 600°C, pressure for 0.1 MPa to 0.3MPa and equivalence ratio from 1.0 to the fuel-lean measurable limit(&gt;0.5). The laminar burning velocity was determined using the area method visualized with schlieren photography. It shows a strong dependence on pre- heat temperature and increases proportionally to the approximate square of the preheat temperature at constant pressure. While the increase of pressure decreases the burning velocity, the dependence is relatively small. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942039. (SP- 1057) An analytical examination of the preigni- tion processes within homogeneous mixtures of a gaseous fuel and air in a motored engine. Z. Liu and G.A. Karim, University of Calgary. Examination is made of the main features of the physical and chemical preignition processes within homogeneous mixtures of air and gaseous fuels, such as propane, methane and hydrogen in a motored engine, while employing detailed chemical kinetics in a one zone analytical model. The changes in the compression temper- ature and pressure due to the admission of gaseous fuels, energy release during the preignition reactions and the contributions of heat transfer and residual gases to the preignition reaction activity were followed over a number of consecutive cycles until the occurrence of autoignition. Some of the observed differences in engine behavior when oper- ating on methane, propane and hydrogen were discussed with partic- ular reference to the observed trends in dual fuel engine operation. Calculated results showed good agreement with some correspond- ing experimental trends. 942041. (SP- 1057) Development of an air/fuel ratio control system for lean burn gas engines. Kenji Nakagawa, Kazuhisa Oka- mota, and Fujio Shoji, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. Research and development of an advanced air/fuel ratio control system for stationary lean-burn gas engines for co- generation have been carried out. The unique feature of this control system is that the air/ fuel ratio is controlled by the feedback from the fluctuation of engine speed. Air/fuel ratio is controlled as high as possible to achieve low NOx emission while maintaining the fluctuation of engine speed within its maximum tolerance. Experiments have been conducted by using a test engine equipped with the new control sys- tem. Superior performance of the system has been demonstrated. 942042.

The effect of cold starts at cold tempera- tures and vehicle weight on tail pipe emissions were investigated with petrol and natural gas operation over the FTP75 and the 91/ 441/EEC drive cycles. The results show that the emissions with nat- ural gas are unaffected by cold temperature, unlike petrol emissions which are several times higher at -15°C than at 24°C. A crude, simulation, accounting for the actual temperature, shows that the conversion of a significant quantity of light duty vehicles to natural gas operation could reduce the emissions of CO and HC by more than 90% in Switzerland. 942043. Emissions from current diesel vehicles. R.H. Ham- merle , D.A. Ketcher, and R.W. H or rocks, Ford Motor Co.; and G. Lepperhof! ' G. Hiithwohl, and B. Liiers, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH and Co. Regulated and non-regulated emissions from five current Euro- pean diesel passenger cars and one light-duty diesel truck were mea- sured to assess the environmental impact of diesel vehicles and to help determine the emission characteristics of the two types of com- bustion systems: indirect injection (IDI) and high speed direct injec- tion (HSDI). The vehicles emissions were measured using the Euro- pean Motor Vehicle Emissions Group (MVEG) cycle and the U.S. Federal (FTP 75) test procedures. Measured emissions included HC, CO, NOx and particulate mass (PM) Ci to C12 hydrocarbon species (here called light hydrocarbon or LHC), aldehydes, particulate com- position and particle size distribution. The particulate composition measurements included soluble organic fraction (SOF), its oil and fuel sub-fractions, and the sulfate fraction. All passenger cars and the light-duty commercial vehicle tested compiled with the current European Emissions Directive 91/441/EEC. Two passenger cars achieved the EEC Stage 2 levels, and one nearly met the 1994 Tier I U.S. Federal standards. The LHC accounted for between 25 to 78% of the total HC measured by the heated FID analyzer. Fuel and oil comprised between 12 and 30% of the PM emissions. The non- methane organic gases (NMOG) emissions and the LHC ozone reac- tivity from diesel cars were both about 50% less than those from gasoline cars. Of the non-regulated emissions, formaldehyde was generally below 0.009 g/km, and benzene emissions were below 0.0035 mg/km. The results were compared with European gasoline vehicles and the Current Gasoline Vehicle fleet of the U.S. Air Quality Improvement Program (AQIRP), and an assessment was made of the relative environmental impacts of gasoline and diesel vehicles. This paper reports on detail regulated and non-regulated emis- sions measurements for six 1992/93 model year diesel vehicles, including two Ford and four competitor vehicles. The emissions were measured on both the 1993 European MVEG cycle and the U.S. AQIRP analytical methods were used for hydrocarbon and aldehydic speciation. The report discusses the regulated emissions from the six diesel vehicles compared to emissions standards, their contribution to urban ozone formation, toxic levels and global warming. It also compares the exhaust emissions of current diesel and gasoline vehicles to help clarify their relative environmental impact. 942044. Quantitative imaging study of the effects of intake air temperate on soot evolution in an optically-accessible D.I. diesel engine. John A. Pinson, General Motors NAO Research and Development Center; and Tuqiang Ni and Thomas A. Litzinger, Pennsylvania State Univ. Simultaneous laser-induced incandescence and light scattering measurements were used to obtain images of the evolving soot field within an optically-accessible DI diesel engine. Optimum signal col- lection parameters were established based on preliminary measure- ments in an ethylene diffusion flame. The effects of intake air tem- perature on soot formation during diesel combustion were investi- gated. Although increased soot production was evident for the higher intake air temperature cases, local particle diameters and number densities of the soot were unaffected for each of the cases tested. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942046. Cylinder-averaged histories of nitrogen oxide in a d.i. diesel with simulated turbocharging. Ronald J. Donahue, Gary L. Borman, and Glenn R. Bower, University of Wisconsin- Madison. An experimental study was conducted using the dumping tech- nique (total cylinder sampling) to produce cylinder mass- averaged nitric oxide histories. Data were taken using a four stroke diesel research engine employing a quiescent chamber, high pressure direct injection fuel system, and simulated turbocharging. Two fuels were used to deter- mine fuel cetane number effects. Two loads were run, one at an equivalence ratio of 0.5 and the other at a ratio of 0.3. The engine speed was held constant at 1500 rpm. Under the turbocharged and retarded timing conditions of this study, nitric oxide was produced up to the point of about 85% mass burned. Two different models were used to simulate the engine run con- ditions: the phenomenological Hiroyasu spray-combustion model, and the three dimensional, U.W.-ERC modified KIVA-II computa- tional fluid dynamic code. Both of the models predicted the correct nitric oxide trend. Although the modified KIVA-II combustion model using Zeldovich kinetics correctly predicted the shapes of the nitric oxide histories, it did not predict the exhaust concentrations without arbitrary adjustment based on experimental values. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942047. Particulate emission characteristics from an impingement diffusion direct injection diesel engine. Hideaki Tanabe, Masashi Takahashi, and G. Takeshi Sato, Kanazawa Insti- tute of Technology; and Satoshi Kato, and Shigeru Onishi, Nippon Clean Engine Lab. A new mixture formation and combustion process for reducing both emissions and fuel consumption has been developed, where the fuel impinges onto the impinging surface and spreads into the free space, named the OSKA process. A single cylinder engine particu- late emission test was conducted with full flow dilution tunnel. The OSKA process shows lower TPM (total particulate matter) emission than the conventional DI diesel at the corresponding operating con- dition. ISF (insoluble fractions) and SOF (Soluble organic fraction) are lower than DI diesel' s. Correlation between SOF and THC of OSKA engine is, however, different from that of conventional DI diesel. OSKA emits lower THC than conventional DI diesel does at the same SOF emission. This is because the wall quenching effect is smaller in OSKA than in conventional DI diesel. A new mixture formation and combustion technology, impinging diffusion one named OSKA, has been developed by the authors. The authors have reported the exhaust and performance characteristics of the OSKA system. The OSKA system has relatively low exhaust emission characteristics as well as low fuel consumption perfor- mance. In the authors' previous report, however, the particulate mat- ters emissions have not included. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942048. Pulsed combustion jet ignition in lean mixtures. E. Murase, S. Ono, and K. Hanada, Kyushu Univ.; and Antoni K. Oppenheim, University of California. Lean-burn is the most attractive way to lower NOx while improving the fuel consumption simultaneously in spark ignition engines. A Pulsed Combustion Jet [PCJ] ignition has a great poten- tial to enhance ignition reliability and burning rate of lean fuel-air mixtures. Its action is based on the utilization of turbulent plumes formed by jets produced by generators, in the shape and size of an ordinary spark plug, that embody a small (500 mm3 or less) cavity, capped with an orifice plate and outfitted with a hollow electrode. 255</page><page sequence="255">942048-942054 Performance characteristics of PCJ were established by combus- tion tests carried out in a disk-shaped, constant volume combustion chamber using lean methane-air mixtures. The results were com- pared to those obtained with Pulsed Plasma Jet (PPJ) and standard spark plug ignition systems. Lean limit was extended most by PCJ ignition under both quiescent and swirl conditions. In the case of swirl, it was revealed that the flame holding in the region of maxi- mum swirl velocity was of prime significance in enhancing the com- bustion rate. In PCJ, the jet plume ejected from the orifice of the generator displayed a similar flame- holding effect, yielding good performance characteristics. 942049. A model for flame initiation and early development in si engine and its application to cycle-to-cycle variations. Huixian Shen, Xi 'an Jiaotong Univ.; and Peter C. Hinze and John B. Heywood , Sloan Automotive Lab. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This paper uses a model which calculates the flame kernel forma- tion and its early development in spark ignition engines to examine the causes of cycle-to-cycle combustion variations. The model takes into account the primary physical factors influencing flame develop- ment. The spark-generated flame kernel size and temperature required to initialize the computation are completely determined by the breakdown energy and the heat conduction from burned region to unburned region. In order to verify the model, the computation results are compared with high-speed Schlieren photography flame development data from an operating spark- ignition engine; they match remarkably well with each other at all test conditions. For the application of this model to the study of cycle-to- cycle variation of the early stage of combustion, additional input is required. First, results from an experiment with a fiber optic spark plug are used to estimate the convective motion of the flame kernel in the vicinity of the spark discharge center at the moment of spark discharge. Then, based on each cycle's convective motion, the mean flame kernel radii are calculated for a fixed time after spark for every cycle, and the flame expansion speeds are obtained. It is found that if only the variation in convection motion is taken into account, the standard deviation of the predicted flame expansion speed distri- bution is much smaller than that determined experimentally. The dispersion in flame kernel development depends on more than the variation in the convection motion. BY assuming that the turbulent kinetic energy is a constant fraction of the total charge kinetic energy from cycle to cycle, the calculated results for the cyclic dis- persion in the expansion speed are brought into good agreement with experiments. This indicates that turbulence variations play a much larger role in the cycle-to-cycle variations in flame develop- ment than do flame kernel convention variations. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942050. Flame speeds in a spark ignition engine. J. Hacohen, M.R. Belmont , and S.J. Ashcroft, University of Exeter. tThis study concerns flame speeds during the ignition and com- bustion processes in a spark-ignition engine. These have been ana- lyzed from both combustion images in the early stages of the flame kernel development, and from the pressure time history. Simulta- neous measurements of engine operating conditions, pressure traces and sequences of combustion images have been made in a single- cylinder four-stroke engine. The early stages of the combustion have been analyzed using stochastic image analysis techniques. These techniques can measure the total kernel growth, the local transla- tional velocity of the centroid, the stretching of the flame kernel sur- face and its roughness. In addition, the fraction of the flame surface area supporting propagation has been determined from the direc- tional variation of flame propagation between successive image frames. From the pressure time history the actual instantaneous flame speed has been derived for the main burn phase and thereafter extrapolated for the ignition phase. Good agreement has been dem- onstrated between the average value of the derived flame speed and well known correlations. For the ignition phase and early stages of combustion, the results demonstrate strong evidence that the flame speed is biased by both ignition effects and by the stretch of the flame kernel surface area. However, after the establishment of a fully developed turbulent flame, the spherical assumption is rather reasonable. 942051. Influence of the characteristic length on perfor- mance of plasma jet ingiters. Koji Yoshida, Hideo Shoji, and Atsushi Saima, Nihon Univ. The investigation regarding performance of plasma jet igniters was explored by using a constant volume vessel. This study focused on investigating the relationship between the jet effect, the hot gas jet issued from the igniter, and combustion enhancement. The hot gas penetration was visualized by the schlieren system with CCD camera and image intensifier. In the cases of small energies, 0.63 and 0.90 J, the combustion enhancement effect is similar to that of combustion jet igniter. In cases of supplied energies, 2.45 and 5.00 J, the jet effect influences on the combustion enhancement effect for small characteristic length of the igniter. 942052. Imaging of lean premixed flames in spark-ignition engines. C. Arcoumanis, C. S. Bae, J. H. Whitelaw, and H. M. Xu, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. Two optical single-cylinder spark-ignition engines equipped with two- and four-valve cylinder heads were used to examine the flow and flame interaction under lean mixture conditions. Images of the developing flame under quiescent, swirl, low tumble and high tumble flow conditions corresponding to a wide range of mean velocity and turbulence levels around the time of ignition were obtained with an image-intensified CCD camera using the light radi- ated by the flame and the flow in the vicinity of the spark plug was quantified by laser Doppler velocimetry. In the case of the tumbling flow, the flame images were software-processed to allow estimation of the total flame area, the displacement of its center as a function of crank angle and their correlation with the cylinder pressure. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942053. Impact of diesel fuel aromatics on particulate, pah and nitro- pah emissions. K. Mitchell, D.E. Steere, and J. A. Taylor, Canadian Petroleum Products Institute; B. Manicom, ORTECH Corp.; J.E. Fisher and E.J. Sienicki, Engine Manufacturers Associ- ation; C. Chiù, Environment Canada; and P. Williams, Natural Resources Canada. This program examined the PAH emissions from two diesel engines representing state-of-the-art technology. One heavy-duty engine, a DDC series 60, used in highway trucks, and one medium- duty engine, Navistar DTA-466, used in pick-up and delivery type vehicles. The medium-duty engine was tested for engine out emis- sions and with two different sized exhaust oxidation catalysts. Both of the catalysts were composed of a ceramic monolith coated with a palladium type catalyst. Both engines were tested according to the US EPA transient emissions test on a series of diesel fuels blended with varying aromatics and PAH contents to determine the impact of fuel quality on emissions. All diesel fuels had a low sulfur content (&lt;0.05%) to minimize the formation of sulphate. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942054. High temperature measurements for on-board diag- nostics of lev/ulev systems. Joe LeGare and Takas hi Tamai, Pana- sonic. High temperature exhaust gas sensors have been sued since 1975 to monitor catalyst over temperature in the Japan auto market. Heated catalyst systems introduced to meet LEV and ULEV will make use of high temperature sensors for control and diagnosis, this paper describes the history and the evolution of these sensors. The three leading sensor technologies consisting of thermistors, thermo- couples, and resistive temperature detectors (RTD) are described. Interface and system requirements for each of the sensor technolo- gies are summarized.

Three-way catalyst assessment via inlet-outlet tem- perature measurements: a preliminary report. Panagiotis D. Sparis, Pantelis Botsaris, Dimitrios Papadopoulos, and Anastasios Karkanis, Democ ritus University of Thrace. The present paper introduces a new method of assessing catalyst performance based on inlet-outlet temperature difference measure- ments. These preliminary experimental results indicate that at idle speed the age and catalytic efficiency affects this temperature differ- ence reducing outlet temperature as the catalyst ages. The reduced efficiency of the catalyst increases also the time required for the equalization of the inlet and outlet temperature. An additional phe- nomenon present in these experiments is the gradual appearance of nonlinear time delayed effects as catalyst age increases that are reflected in the autocorrelation function of the temperature differ- ence signal. These effects can be used for a catalyst performance assessment using temperature probes instead of the normal exhaust gas chemical analyzers. 942056. The effect of manganese oxides on OBD-II catalytic converter monitoring. Joseph W. Roos, Denis L Lenane, Ben F. Fort, Doni G. Grande, and Kenneth L. Dykes, Ethyl Corp. Extensive vehicle fleet testing has demonstrated that use of MMT can reduce net tailpipe out emissions. The use of fuel contain- ing the octane-enhancing, emission-reducing fuel additive leads to manganese oxide deposits in the vehicle exhaust system. Studies of the physical and chemical effects of manganese oxide deposits on the performance of catalytic converters conclusively demonstrated that MMT does not adversely affect catalytic converters and, in fact, protected the converters from phosphorus and zinc. Despite the overwhelming evidence that MMT is compatible with catalytic converters and vehicle emission control systems, con- cerns have recently been raised about the effect of manganese oxides on OBD-II catalytic converter monitoring. These concerns are unfounded based on results from studies on the effect of MMT on the dual EGO catalytic converter monitoring system using vehi- cles and components from an extensive vehicle fleet test program designed in consultation with the EPA and automobile industry. In the study, paired vehicles which accumulated over 100,000 miles on fuel with or without MMT were used. The paper includes results from component testing on vehicles and bench testing. The results of this testing show that MMT does not adversely affect the moni- toring quality of the dual EGO sensor method for catalyst monitor- ing. 942057. A review of the dual EGO sensor method for OBD-II catalyst efficiency monitoring. Jeffrey S. Hepburn, Douglas A. Dobson, Carolyn P. Hubbard, Steven O. Guldberg, Eva Thanasiu, William L. Watkins, Beverly D. Burns, and Haren S. Gandhi, Ford Motor Co. This paper provides an overview of the dual EGO sensor method for OBD-II catalyst efficiency monitoring. The processes governing the relationship between catalyst oxygen storage, HC conversion efficiency, and rear EGO sensor response are reviewed in detail. A simple physical model relating catalyst oxygen storage capacity and rear EGO sensor response is constructed and used in conjunction with experimental data to provide additional insight into the opera- tion of the catalyst monitor. The effect that the catalyst washcoat formulation has in determining the relationship between catalyst oxygen storage capacity and HC conversion efficiency and its impact on the catalyst monitor is also investigated. Lastly, the effects of catalyst failure mode, fuel sulfur, and the fuel additive MMT on the catalyst monitor's ability to properly diagnose catalyst function are discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942058. Catalytic converter diagnosis using the catalyst exo- therm. Joseph R. Theis, AC Delco Systems. A study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of using the catalyst exotherm to diagnose the emission performance of the cata- lytic converter. The exotherm was evaluated as a potential diagnos- tic for large volume underfloor converters as well as for small vol- ume warmup converters. Emphasis was placed on the ability to properly diagnose the emission performance of the converters while the vehicle was driven under a variety of transient driving schedules. For this study, type K thermocouples were used for measuring the temperatures. To minimize the variability of the exotherm data during transient driving, the exotherm needs to be sampled under fairly stable exhaust flow conditions. If a transient maneuver such as an accelera- tion occurs, a stabilization time is required before the exotherm can be sampled. The steady-state HC conversion of underfloor catalytic convert- ers correlated well with the exotherm measured at the rear of the cat- alyst over a large range of conversions. However, due to the large thermal mass and consequent long stabilization times of underfloor converters, it would be difficult to use the exotherm to diagnose the steady-state HC conversion during transient driving. For a large range of FTP hydrocarbon emissions, the FTP HC performance of underfloor converters correlated will with an equa- tion that utilized exotherms measured at both the front and the rear of the catalyst. The front and rear exotherms were intended to reflect the lightoff performance and the warmed-up performance of the cat- alyst, respectively. However, similar to the steady-state diagnostic, the time required for the rear exotherm to stabilize after a transient maneuver would make it difficult to use these exotherms to diagnose the FTP performance of underfloor converters during transient driv- ing. Since most of the initial increase in FTP HC occurs due to a loss of converter lightoff performance, it may be feasible to monitor small increases in the FTP HC for underfloor converters by monitor- ing the exotherm only in the front part of the catalyst. Stabilization criteria for the vehicle speed and the exotherm were developed that significantly reduced the variability of the sampled exotherm data (similar criteria could be used for the exhaust flow rate and the exo- therm). The sampled exotherms decreased with increasing vehicle speed. The data suggests that the bed temperature sensor needs to be placed farther back than 2.54cm from the front face of the brick, in order to more accurately diagnose catalysts that have been deacti- vated due to engine misfire. It may be feasible to diagnose the FTP performance of small vol- ume warmup converters with the exotherm. This could be appropri- ate for TLEV, LEV, and ULEV vehicles in California, where war- mup converters may be used to help meet the more stringent emis- sion standards. For three 0.5L warmup converters with different FTP HC conversions, temperature data was collected on a variety of transient driving schedules. For converters with FTP HC conver- sions of 90% and 58%, the exotherm data collected when the stabili- zation criteria were satisfied were found to be significantly different at a 95% confidence level. Again, the exotherms varied with the vehicle speed. This is attributable in part to decreasing HC, CO, and NOx emissions with increasing vehicle speed. For both underfloor converters and warmup converters, the exo- therm data in a certain speed interval l(e.g., 30-40 MPH) could be processed with on-line statistical technique s(e.g., Exponentially Weighted Moving Average). The result of this EWMA analysis could be compared to a threshold value for that speed interval stored in the control module. Similar analysis could be performed for the exotherm data in other speed intervals. The results of the analyses for the different speed intervals could be used collectively to deter- mine if the Malfunction-Indicator- Light should be illuminated. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942059. S.I. engine misfire detection through the energy model. Byeongjin Lim, Inkeon Lim, Jongbum PArk, Sang soo Pae, Young S. Yoon, and Eungseo Kim, Seoul National Univ. This paper describes the method to detect S.I. engine misfire for the OBD II requirement. In most methods related to the misfire detection, the fluctuation of crankshaft speed is used as an input parameter. 257</page><page sequence="257">942059-942065 If the misfire detection is performed by the pattern of cranksahft speed without considering the engine dynamics, it is difficult to determine the misfire at high speed and low load condition. So this paper proposed the single degree of freedom energy model of engine dynamics for the misfire detection. Through this model the integral of torque by cylinder pressures are estimated using the variation of crankshaft speed and it is possible to detect the misfire by this inte- gral value. 942060. A theoretical and experimental study of the modes of end gas autoignition leading to knock in s.i. engines. J. Pan and C.G.W. Sheppard, University of Leeds. A 2-D simulation of fluid dynamic and chemistry interaction fol- lowing end gas autoignition has demonstrated three distinct modes of reaction, dependent upon the temperature gradient about an exo- thermic center. All three modes (deflagration, developing detona- tion and thermal explosion) can contribute to knock; the developing detonation case, associated with intermediate temperature gradient, has been identified as the more damaging. The simulation code (LUMAD) has been used in a systematic parametric study designed to separate the complex interacting events which can lead to mixed modes in real engines. A most significant finding related to the sequential autoignition of multiple exothermic centers. For two exo- thermic centers characterized by large temperature gradients, which would normally yield the relatively benign deflagrative mode, it was found that pressure waves emanating from the first could modify the temperature gradient and so promote violent developing detonation mode at the adjacent center. The LUMAD code was modified to allow arbitrary flame front definition and autoignition center loca- tion. It was also adapted to include a particle tracking routine. It was then applied to data collected in an associated series of engine experiments to allow comparison of velocity fields and pressure records. Generally good agreement was obtained, allowing infer- ence of data for events too fast to monitor with conventional instru- mentation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942061. Radical behavior in preflame reactions under knock- ing operation in a spark ignition engine. Hideo Shoji, Yasuhiro To saka, Koji Yoshida, and Atsushi Saima, Nihon Univ. Using absorption spectroscopy, simultaneous measurements were made of the behavior of the OH(Characteristic spectrum of 306.4 nm), CH(431.5 nm) and C2(516.5 nm) radicals in the end-gas region and center of the combustion chamber of a spark-ignition engine during preflame reactions with four types of fuel having dif- ferent octane numbers. The results of this research show that the behavior of the OH, CH and C2 radicals in preflame reactions dif- fered significantly in both the center and end-gas region of the com- bustion chamber depending on the octane number of the fuel and also between normal and knocking combustion conditions. 942062. Autoignition chemistry studies on primary reference fuels in a motored engine. Houliang Li, Srinivasa K. Prabhu, David L. Miller, and Nicholas P. Cernansky, Drexel Univ. Autoignition chemistry of n-heptane, iso-octane and an 87 octane blend, 87 PRF, was studied in a single-cylinder modified Wisconsin model AENL engine under motored conditions. Use of a fast-acting sampling valve and gas chromatographic analysis allowed measure- ment of in-cylinder gas composition during the ignition process. Crank angle resolved species evolution profiles were generated for all three fuels at a fixed inlet temperature of 376 K. For n-heptane, the measurements were made during a cyclically repeatable two stage ignition process up to the point of hot ignition (the second stage ignition). These n-heptane experiments were run at (1) = 0.3 to avoid excessive pressure rise at hot ignition which might damage our engine. Iso-octane and 87 PRF were run at stoichiometric equiv- alence ratio which did not have a second stage ignition, and species were measured only during the first stage of ignition. In addition, a series of in-cylinder gas composition measurements were made for iso-octane at inlet temperatures ranging from 350 to 500 CAD at a fixed residence time (20 CAD ATDC) where the first stage of igni- tion ceased. An oxidation mechanism has been assembled to describe the chemical processes responsible for the measured species and igni- tion behavior. Some reactions have been examined and discussed in detail based on the experimental data. The results of 87 PRF oxida- tion show that the oxidation paths for each fuel component are essentially the same as in the case of neat fuel, with the interaction between the two components primarily via the reactive radical pool. The purpose of the present work is to extend our understanding of the autoignition chemistry of primary reference fuels and their interaction during autoignition and oxidation. The specific objec- tives are: (1) measuring detailed time resolved species evolution profiles during ignition of these fuels, and assembling a reaction mechanism to describe the chemical processes responsible for the oxidation products and ignition behavior; and (2) obtaining concen- trations of fuel components and oxidation products during ignition of a PRF mixture to confirm and extend our understanding of the interaction between n-heptane and iso-octane oxidation. The pri- mary approach used was to conduct experiments with n-heptane, iso-octane and an 87 octane blend (87 PRF) in a motored research engine. Use of a fast- acting gas sampling valve and gas chromato- graphic analysis allowed measurement of in-cylinder gas composi- tion during the ignition process. Based on the available literature, an oxidation mechanism has been assembled to describe the chemi- cal processes responsible for the measured species and ignition behavior. Some reactions have been examined and discussed in detail. The results of 87 PRF have been used to examine the interac- tion between n-heptane and iso-octane during oxidation. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942063. Fuel evaporation and the high-speed knock phenom- enon of methanol-gasoline blended fuels. Derek P. Moran, Uni- versity of Cape Town. The results of an investigation into intake system fuel evapora- tion are used to study the influence of engine speed on fuel anti- knock performance. It is found that, while adding methanol to gaso- line causes dramatic cooling at low engine speeds, this relative effect is lost at higher speeds, primarily due to lower residence times. At low speeds, the cooling inhibits knock for methanol- gasoline blends. However, at high speeds, these blends are found to lose this relative advantage, removing the knock inhibition provided by cooling, and this facilitates knocking at high speeds. 942064. Knock damage mechanisms in spark-ignition engines. R.J. Nates and A.D.B. Yates, University of Cape Town. The objective of this preliminary investigation was to identify the mechanisms by which knocking combustion cause engine damage. The project was motivated by the need for a knock intensity mea- surement based on a damage related threshold and not the arbitrary octane-heptane scales. The scope of this work includes a detailed investigation to determine the modes of engine failure resulting from knocking combustion. Using the physical evidence from a col- lection of knock damaged pistons and other parts, the mechanisms of failure are reconstructed by deductive reasoning. The manner in which knock causes surface erosion, ring fracture, piston land crack- ing and fracture, piston blow-by and seizure are all addressed. The interrelationships between these various modes of failure are also considered. It is shown that there are two distinctly different aspects of knocking combustion that can initiate damage, namely global heat flux and local pressure-temperature pulses. It is thus proposed that either of these two primary failure mechanisms could form the basis of a damage-related knock-intensity criterion. This would result in two different values of damage potential for a given operat- ing condition, each referring to its particular damage pathway. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942065.

In this study, octane number requirement (ONR) of 13 makes of two wheeled vehicles constituting the bulk of current production was measured using full boiling range gasolines as well as primary reference fuels. Knock intensity was measured by an instrument which measures and analyzes cylinder head vibrations in the fre- quency range of 5 to 12 kHz. Among different makes, ONR varied from 51.5 to 101 research octane number (RON) and 48- 86 motor octane number (MON). ONR of the 2-stroke engine powered vehi- cles measured using primary reference fuels was found to be closer to MON of the full boiling range reference fuels. 942066. (SP- 1053) Diesel oxidation catalyst application strat- egies with special emphasis on odor reduction. Paul Zelenka, AVL List GmbH; and Günter Hohenberg and Ulrich Graf, Technical Univ. This paper deals with problems arising on the one hand from applying diesel oxidation catalyst for minimizing HC emission at low exhaust gas temperatures prevailing in the European city driv- ing cycle and on the other hand in preventing sulphate formation in the oxidation catalyst at higher temperatures as they appear e.g. in the ECE R49 13-mode certification cycle. The main parameters influencing the catalyst efficiency - exhaust gas temperature level, sulphur content in the fuel and catalyst specifications - are discussed and new solutions to fulfill the conflicting requirements are pres- ented. The use of a highly active catalyst for exhaust gas treatment only up to the temperature limit of sulfates formation and by- passing, it in the high temperature range appears to be a viable solu- tion. As a result of this strategy, the oxidation catalyst is applicable in a wide exhaust gas temperature range from 150 up to 550 degrees Celsius with negligible sulphate emissions and high conversions efficiencies of the particulate soluble organic fraction and of gas- eous emissions HC, CO, aldehydes and odor. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942067. (SP- 1053) Effect of cerium fuel additive on the emis- sions characteristics of a heavy-duty diesel engine. Jacques Lemaire, Rhone- Poulenc; and Magdi Khair, Southwest Research Institute. In the past, concentrated efforts were directed at developing a cost effective and reliable particulate trap, assisted by mechanical (burners) or electrical (heating elements) regeneration means. Although ceramic monolith filter developments have been straight- forward, regeneration systems have proven to be problematic and costly. Therefore, these development efforts led to disappointing results. Using catalyst fuel additives to promote regeneration in a trap through lowering the incineration temperature of collected soot is an attractive alternative. This passive form of regeneration could be technically and economically advantageous for diesel applications by eliminating complex sensors and controllers required for regener- ation systems in new installations as well as retrofitting older vehi- cles. A cerium based fuel additive was used to assist in regenerating particulate traps in diesel exhaust after treatment. Although positive results were obtained in applications where this additive was uti- lized, some potential users as well as environmentalists suspect that it may cause deterioration in gaseous emissions characteristics. This paper is written in anticipation of questions regarding poten- tial emissions of harmful compounds which could be related to cerium fuel additive. It describes the effect of this additive on the regulated and some unregulated emissions in a North-American heavy-duty diesel engine. 942068. (SP- 1053) Effects of a ceramic particulate trap and copper fuel additive on heavy-duty diesel emissions. George D. Harvey, Kirby J. Baumgard, John H. Johnson, Linda D. Gratz, Susan T. Bagley, and David G. Leddy, Michigan Technological Univ. This research quantifies the effects of a copper fuel additive on the regulated {Oxides of nitrogen (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC) and total particulate matter (TPM)] and unregulated emissions [soluble organic fraction (SOF), vapor phase organics (XOC), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitro-PAH, particle size distributions and mutagenic activity] from a 1988 Cummins LTA10 diesel engine using a low sulfur fuel. The engine was operated at two steady state modes (EPA modes 9 and 11, which are 75 and 25% load at rated speed, respectively) and five additive levels (0, 15, 30, 60 and 100 ppm Cu by mass) with and without a ceramic trap. Measurements of PAH and mutagenic activity were limited to the 0, 30 and 60 ppm Cu levels. Data were also collected to assess the effect of the addi- tive on regeneration temperature and duration. Copper species col- lected within the trap were identified and exhaust copper concentra- tions quantified. The fuel additive had little effect on baseline emissions (without the trap) of TPM, SOF, XOC, HC or NOx. Particle size distributions indicated that there was a trend towards more nuclei mode particles with increasing additive level, but an overall increase in mass emis- sions was not detected. Use of the additive generally resulted in reductions of PAH in both the SOF and XOC. Additive effects on mutagenic activity appeared to be mode dependent, with decreases in activity at mode 9 and relatively little change at mode 11. The trap reduced TPM from 72 to 93% compared to baseline, had no effect on NOx, and reduced HC about 30% at mode 9 with no consistent change at mode 11. The trap's SOF removal efficiency was greater at mode 9 (84 to 91%) than at mode 11 (55 to 88%). The XOC reductions were less than 48% at mode 9, with mode 1 1 again showing no consistent change. Collection of copper by the trap was greater than 95%, resulting in a 44 pg/m3 emission rate at mode 9 with 100 ppm copper in the fuel. Pah were generally reduced in the SOF by the trap, but displayed no change or were slightly increased in the XOC. As found in previous studies at MTU with traps, the particle and vapor phase associated mutagenic response generally decreased over time with continued use of the trap (this occurred at all additive levels in this study). The additive reduced the trap regeneration temperature from 510°C to abot 375°C and reduced the regeneration time from about 90 minutes with no additive to about 1 minute with 30 ppm and greater additive concentrations. Trap ash analysis showed that approximately 89.5% of the material was CuO, 2.5% was CU2O, and 8% was CaS04. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 942069.

Investigations were carried out on a 12L DI/TCI HD diesel engine which meets the US94 emission standards. From the work done the most effective combination of the engine control measures has been established as an appropriate solution to increase the exhaust gas temperature up to 400 deg. C. at minimum penalty with respect to emissions and fuel consumption. Furthermore, the influence of Cerium on engine-out emissions and fuel consumption has been investigated. It could be shown that by using Cerium, the fuel consumption improves on average by about 2 percent. 259</page><page sequence="259">942069-942094 Depending upon trap soot loading as well as on the availability of sufficiently high gas temperature the particulate trap can be cleaned to nearly the original porosity. 942070. (SP- 1053) Simultaneous reduction of diesel particu- late and nox using a plasma. E. Robert Fanick and Bruce B. Bykowski , Southwest Research institute. A non-thermal plasma treatment of diesel engine exhaust was effective in removing particulate (soot) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from two different light-duty diesel vehicles: an older- tech- nology indirect-injection Toyota truck, and a newer- technology direct-injection Dodge truck. Particulate removal efficiencies and NOx conversion efficiencies were determined at space velocities up to 20,000/hr. Particulate removal efficiencies were above 60 percent for most conditions, but decreased with increasing space velocities. Conversion efficiencies for NOx and carbon monoxide (CO) were also dependent on the space velocity. The NOx conversion efficien- cies were generally greater than 40 percent at space velocities less than 7000/hr. The CO concentration increased through the plasma reaction bed indicating that CO was produced by reactions in the plasma. In general, the results from these tests showed that the plasma reaction bed was capable of reducing both particulates and NOx simultaneously, a result which has not been demonstrated with any other single technology. 942071. A new test for catalyst oxygen storage which corre- lates with catalyst performance on the vehicle. Jeffrey S. Hep- burn, Douglas A. Dobson, and Haren S. Gandhi, Ford Motor Co. A new laboratory test for measuring catalyst oxygen storage capacity has been developed. The test accurately predicts catalyst performance on the vehicle during transient A/F excursions and cor- relates well with vehicle CO and NOx tailpipe emissions. The test was subsequently used to facilitate improved oxygen storage capac- ity for new Pd-only washcoat formulations. 942072. Gasoline burner for rapid catalyst light-off. Jeffrey S. Hepburn, Andrew A. Adamczyk, and Robert A. Pawłowicz, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes a study which was carried out to assess the potential for using a gasoline burner to heat the catalytic convenor during cold start. The results showed the catalyst/burner concept to be a promising LEV/ULEV capable technology. On a 1993 Ford Grand Marquis equipped with a catalyst burner system, catalyst light-off was achieved in less than 15 seconds while cold start HC emissions during the first 60 seconds of the FTP test were reduced by 60%. In addition, data is presented which compare the perfor- mance of the catalyst/burner to an electrically heated catalyst. In the tests performed, the catalyst/burner system outperformed the EHC. Practical considerations, however, such as safety, durability, system integration, and packaging still need to be addressed. 942086.

While braking cars as well as trucks, a large amount of energy is taken into the brake system in a short period of time. This leads to some problems e.g. cracking of the disc, non-uniform wear of pad and disc. The paper describes methods to analyze the cracking prob- lem of the disc. It is pointed out, how the pressure distribution between pad and disc can be measured before and after a special test procedure. With FEM-modelling the distribution of normal and fric- tion forces in the contact zone between pad and disc is calculated. The measurements and the calculations describe a pathway to simu- late some reasons and remedies for the solution of the problem. 942087. The application of predictive techniques to study thermo-elastic instability of brakes. Tseng-Kuan Kao and John William Richmond, T&amp;N Technology Ltd.; and Malcolm William Moore, Ferodo Ltd. The paper covers the development, validation and use of a tech- nique to predict hot spot formation. The technique involves the use of a specially developed finite element able to deal with heat genera- tion and wear. It is applicable to real braking geometries and duty cycles and an example of its use will be presented. Following the description of the technique its use to carry out a sensitivity study into the effect of pad and disc parameters upon hot spot formation is described. The parameters include pad and wear properties and the duty cycle. 942092. (SP- 1051) Development and test of a pilot display for surface operations. Stanley L. Zimmerman, Rockwell International. An airport surface operations (taxi) display is an electronically generated, graphic representation of airport layout data installed in the aircraft cockpit to assist pilots in navigating airport surfaces. This electronic airport map is intended primarily to improve the effi- ciency and safety of airport ground operations, especially at busy, complex, or unfamiliar airports. Concepts for potential situational awareness and safety improve- ments on the airport surface, and low visibility guidance applica- tions were developed. Surface operations display symbology, alpha- numeric information, taxi map transformations, and other graphics issues were evaluated. Navigation equipment issues were also inves- tigated with differential GPS being the obvious choice for position sensor. A set of in-house developed software tools was used to gen- erate databases from Jeppesen data for several airports. Data accu- racy requirements were addressed with earth model, survey and digitization errors being considered. Recommendations for the orga- nization and contents of airport databases to support surface opera- tions were made. A prototype LCD display unit was built and surface operations display software developed to be used in Airport Surface Traffic Automation (ASTA) Trials in the presence of the FAA at the Atlan- tic City International Airport to prove these concepts. A data link implementation (RTCA/DO-219) is included for two-way commu- nications with Air Traffic Control (ATC) and to uplink the positions of other vehicles/aircraft. This datalinked information includes assigned taxipaths and stop-bars which are displayed graphically. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942093. (SP- 1051) Standardizing interactive display func- tions on the 111 flight deck. Jean M. Crane, Eric S. Bang, and Martin C. Härtel, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. The 111 flight deck will introduce two new functions, the elec- tronic checklist function (ECL) and the flight deck communication function (FDCF), on interactive displays. Two cursor control devices (CCD) provide each pilot control of these new functions. The appearance and operation of the displays were standardized by specifying a common user interface (CUI). Ease of training and operation dictated an integrated design approach wherein the design and operational requirements for FDCF and ECL were developed together with the CCD and CUI. 942094. (SP- 1051) Flight deck automation: problems and concerns as reported in the Aviation Safety Reporting System. Michael Reynolds, Mark Neumeier, and Robert Mitman, Crew Sys- tem Ergonomics Information Analysis Center; and Albert Rehmann, Federal Aviation Administration. Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports were ana- lyzed to identify flightdeck operational problems related to aircraft automation systems, particularly those problems that may be exacer- bated by the addition of data link systems. Four major automation problem groups were discovered (Automation Failure, Program- ming Errors, Distraction-Programming, and Mismanagement- Con- fusion). Also, several automation-induced errors were identified (e.g., runway incursions and altitude deviations). 260</page><page sequence="260">942094-942108 The reports are classified by attributes such as automation system and flight error. Each automation group is discussed, and based on a limited sample of reports, conclusions are drawn; with respect to data link, potential positive and negative impacts are described. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942095. (SP- 1051) Flight deck party line/situational aware- ness: issues as reported to the Aviation Safety Reporting Sys- tem. Mark Neumeier, Robert Mitman, and Michael Reynolds , Crew System Ergonomics Information Analysis Center ; and Albert Reh- mann , Federal Aviation Administration. The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) was searched to determine errors associated with the use of the party line (PL). Pilots occasionally misinterpret and/or receive inaccurate PL information; based on this information, they make incorrect and potentially dan- gerous decisions. Detailed analysis revealed two types of errors: those attributed to inaccurate PL information and those resulting from incorrect flightcrew actions based on the PL. Almost half the errors involving incorrect flightcrew actions were a result of execut- ing unauthorized clearances because of confusion caused by similar call signs. Conclusions are drawn with respect to the loss of the PL in a data link environment. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942096. (SP- 1051) Flight Deck Crew Alerting: problems and concerns as reported in the Aviation Safety Reporting System. Robert Mitman, Mark Neumeier, and Michael Reynolds, Crew Sys- tem Ergonomics Information Analysis Center; and Albert Rehmann, Federal Aviation Administration. NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) database was searched to identify problems in flight deck alerting design methodologies that should be considered during the design of data link alerting systems. Detailed analysis identified six major crew alerting problem areas: Distraction of Alert, Missed Alerts, Lack of Alerts, Alert Inhibit Logic, Non-Distinct Alerts, and Multiple Alerts. The problem areas resulted in a variety of flight technical errors (e.g., altitude and heading deviations, aborted takeoffs). These results are presented, and any pertinence to the design of a data link crew alerting scheme is cited. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942100. Balance accuracy and repeatability measured at low loads. Richard B. Russell and Patrick R. Carroll, Rockwell Interna- tional. It is common practice in wind tunnel testing to choose a balance that has a force range approximating the expected load range to be encountered during the test. This paper presents comparisons of accuracies obtained using both high and low load range balances in low load applications. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942103. Design improvements and their evaluation in pneu- matic starters for gas turbine engines. David Spina, Hamilton Standard Division of United Technologies. Modern start systems for large gas turbine engines typically employ a pneumatic starter. The reliability of the pneumatic starter has a direct impact on flight dispatch reliability. This is due to the nature of its task and the fact that it is typically called to perform this task immediately prior to departure. The ever increasing perfor- mance demands placed on the starter require that the starter design be continually refined in order to improve overall start system per- formance and increase flight dispatch reliability. After analyzing starter malfunctions, a number of design improvements were defined. Prior to production incorporation, lim- ited quantities of hardware of improved design were sent to specific airlines for evaluation in "real- world" applications. This affords an evaluation of the performance of these design improvements and a measure of the increase in reliability which can be expected. 942104. Enhanced air turbine starter clutch design. Andy Krochmalny, AlliedSignal, Inc.; and Peter J. Louden, Boeing Com- mercial Airplane Group. Since introduction into service, the B737-300 starter has been susceptible to clutch damage. At the onset of the problem, a team was formed to identify the causes of clutch damage and shear shaft failures and to define a corrective action. Several in- service air- planes were equipped with recording instrumentation, and data from over 10,000 start cycles was recorded. It was noted that large pneu- matic duct pressure fluctuations from a variety of causes played an important role in the reason for the starter reliability problem. After understanding the problem, a design improvement program was launched to replace the current pawl-and-ratchet clutch with an inner-race overrunning sprag clutch that would be capable of with- standing resulting duct pressure fluctuations. 942105. Synchronous engagement clutch. Frank De Vita, Ham- ilton Standard Division of United Technologies; and Ray Quen- neville, RNQ Design. A clutch in a pneumatic starter must perform three basic func- tions: 1) transmit starter turbine torque to the engine shaft when the starter turbine torque is accelerating the engine shaft, 2) prevent the output shaft from driving the starter turbine when the engine shaft speed exceeds the starter turbine speed, and 3) allow re-engagement when the engine shaft is already rotating (running engagement). Previous clutch designs were capable of achieving the first two requirements, but were limited in their ability to successfully achieve running engagements. In many instances, "crash re- engagements" occurred, often damaging the starter and typically causing an operation disruption. A solution is the synchronous engagement clutch which permits running engagements at any starter operating speed. The synchronous engagement clutch repre- sents a paradigm sift in clutch design for pneumatic starters which increases the operational flexibility of the pneumatic starter. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942106. Air turbine start system for the next generation of large commercial aerospace engines. Andy Krochmalny, Allied- Signal, Inc.; Alain Roussel, SNECMA ; and Alan Smith, GE Aircraft Engines. The criterion for the GE-90 engine, including all controls and accessories, was to achieve a robust design with Early ETOP's certi- fication. The start requirements of this engine dictated a starter in the 310Kw/1440N-m range that would fit in a 33-cm long by 25-cm wide envelope and weight less than 24.5 Kg. These requirements made it necessary to develop a new start system for this application. A multi-company Integrated Product Development (IPD) team was formed to identify reliability drivers and develop design improve- ments. The team achieved the program's objectives and pioneered many new features to meet the goals. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942107. Integration of design, materials, and processes for airplane interiors. Robert E. Elliott, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Careful integration of materials, processes, and designs for air- craft interiors is critical to successfully designing and producing air- planes, and of supporting airline customers. This paper discusses new thermoplastic materials being investigated, the processes by which these materials are formed into interior components, such as stowage boxes and lavatory modules, and how the new thermoplas- tic materials can be used advantageously to meet the basic design requirements of interior components as well as meet the systems requirements defined by the total airplane operating environment. 942108. State of the art aircraft interior designs. Tom McFar- land, C&amp;D Aerospace. The down cycle of the mid nineties in the aviation industry has caused the airframe manufacturers and the airlines to rethink the way interiors are typically procured. The eighties (80' s) and early 261</page><page sequence="261">942108-942120 nineties (90' s) allowed the airlines and airframe manufacturers to employ large groups of in-house interior personnel. Volumes were high and virtually everyone in the aerospace industry was profitable. The competitive environment of a down market has led to consider- able down-sizing and interior staffs of the past can no longer be completely supported. In order to remain competitive, thei airlines and airframe manufacturers (also referred to as original equipment manufacturers or OEM's), are turning to the interior suppliers to control costs while manufacturing state-of-the-art designs that meet the ever changing regulatory and quality standards imposed by the industry. 942109. Environment aspects of in-flight waste management. Kenneth M. Khteian and Thomas M. Lee , Aero-design Technology, Inc. A new in-flight waste management system has been developed for commercial aircraft that enables on-board personnel to collect and source-separate waste and recyclable fractions using a compart- mentalized trolley. The trolley is then inserted into a galley-based, high force compactor. A microprocessor controls a hydraulic car- riage assembly that automatically shuttles on rails over each of three bins within the trolley, and contents are compacted. This space saving compaction technology maintains the benefits of in-flight compaction, reduces in-flight and ground waste handling and processing time, and promotes or expands recycling programs. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942110. Current and future trends of cabin training simula- tion. Sally Glenn, Thomson Training and Simulation, Inc. Currently, the airline industry is demanding increased perfor- mance from its training staff and training systems. And today, opti- mal training performance depends on new technology. This chal- lenge has led to the creation of systems that offer a broader range of cabin training solutions. One new system is the IntelliDoor™. This new system is an intelligent door training program that inte- grates the latest touchscreen computer technology with multi-media interaction and proven instructional methods. The result is a product that delivers consistent, precise, self-paced training without the need for constant instructor supervision. 942111. (SP- 1051) Superimposed symbology: attentional problems and design solutions. Robert S. McCann, Western Aero- space Laboratories ; and David C. Foyle, NASA. This paper reviews recent human factors research studies con- ducted in the Aerospace Human Factors Research Division at NASA Ames Research Center on superimposed symbology and head-up displays (HUD's). We first identify various performance problems that have been associated with HUD use. Results of exper- iments that suggest an attentional account of these problems are described. A design solution involving the concept of ''scene- linked" HUD's is developed, and an experiment testing the design solution is discussed. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942112. Pros and cons of integrated modular avionic archi- tectures for utility controls. Grenville Hughes and Tony Plattner, AlliedSignal Equipment Systems. To meet the growing demand for more reliable and maintainable electronic controls for regional aircraft utility systems, a basic inte- grated utility subsystem control (IUSC) design has been created for new regional aircraft. The final design is based on integrated modu- lar avionics (IMA), but the pros and cons of various configurations played an important part in the conceptual selection of the final architecture. The defined configuration is expected to be adaptable for aircraft in the new regional transport (NRT) category covering 50 to 130 passenger aircraft. During the preliminary design process, it was necessary to develop several computer tools to assist in the complex task of inte- grating 16 or more utility subsystems. Following the conceptual design phase, a detailed design was created to provide specifics for the cost/benefit analyses that had to be accomplished to verify the benefits of installing an IUSC on a new aircraft. 942113. Secondary power generation - Tomorrow's concepts and today's risks. Edward D. Beauchamp, AlliedSignal Aerospace Co. This paper presents an overview of electric secondary power sys- tem configurations for future military and commercial aircraft. The overview includes a description of the salient elements of each con- figuration, as well as a comparative assessment of the near-term application risks. Configurations range from conventional 115 V, 3-phase, 400 Hz to engine integrated 270 Vdc systems. The Defense Systems Management College, Ft. Belvior, VA, methodology is used for risk assessment. The elements of risk for each configuration are identified and quantified to indicate areas of technical develop- ment in support of risk reduction. The selected configurations are in keeping with those being actively pursued by the TriService/NASA Joint Planning Team (JPT) for More-Electric Aircraft (MEA), headed by the USAF Wright Laboratories (WL). Specific approaches for military fighter aircraft are described in the Northrop Military Aircraft Division Management and Distribution of More Electric (MADMEL) tech- nology program and, for commercial transport aircraft, in the McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Power By Wire (PBW) technology program. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942114. (SP- 1051) Improved operational reliability and safety with HUD - The Alaska Airlines experience. Kim J. Kai- ser, Alaska Airlines. This paper relates the experience of Alaska Airlines in the acqui- sition and operation of the Heads Up Display (HUD) on its fleet of 23 Boeing 727-200 aircraft. The airline has accrued more than five years of successful experience with the system since its first installa- tion in late 1987. In using this system for approaches to Category Ilia (Cat Ilia) weather minimums, Alaska differs from most prior HUD users in that the approaches are flown and landed manually, as opposed to the more common use of the HUD to monitor the autopilot during a coupled, autoland approach. 1994 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 942116. (SP- 1051) X-31 helmet mounted visual and aural dis- play (HMVAD) system. Steven C. Boehmer, United States Air Force. Agile aircraft (X-29, X-31, F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle, and F-16 Multi-' Axis Thrust Vector) test pilots, while flying at high angles of attack, experience difficulty predicting their flight path tra- jectory. To compensate for the loss of this critical element of situa- tional awareness, the X-31 International Test Organization (ITO) installed and evaluated a helmet mounted display (HMD) system into an X-3 1 aircraft and simulator. Also investigated for incorpora- tion within the HMD system and flight evaluation was another can- didate technology for improving situational awareness - three- dimensional (3-D) audio. This was the first flight test evaluating the coupling of visual and audio cuing for aircrew aiding. The focus of the endeavor, which implemented two visual and audio formats, was to examine the extent visual and audio orientation cuing enhanced situational awareness and improved pilot performance during tacti- cal flying. This paper provides an overview of the X-31 HMVAD system, describes the visual and audio symbology, presents a sum- mary of the pilots' subjective evaluation of the system following its use in simulation and flight test, and outlines the future plans for the X-31 HMVAD system. 942120. How an Earth orbiting tether makes possible an affordable Earth-Moon space transportation system. Eagle Sar- mont, Lockheed Advanced Development Co. The Earth orbiting tether, is based in part on the elevator into space idea that was described by Arthur C. Clark in his book, "The Fountains of Paradise."

Implantation of a distributed CAPP system (com- puter aided process planning) at Cummins Brasil. Haroldo Kerry , Jr., Waldomiro Modern Filho , Carlos E. S. Ribeiro, and Alexandre S. L. de Almeida, KSR Consultoria e Cummins Brasil. The link between product engineering and shop floor is process planning engineering. The manufacturing process plan gives support to a series of departments, from PPC to quality, tooling, selling and shop floor, being of central importance to enterprise's competitive- ness. This paper shows a computer aided process planning (CAPP) system development at Cummins, which significantly increased pro- cess planning productivity, besides giving gains on quality, tracking and reliability of information. 942422. Strategy for a technological innovation in a company of the autoparts sector. Ettore Bresciani Filho and Vivaldo A. Fer- nandes Russo, Unicamp e Equipamentos Clark.

Quality and productivity increment in welded joints with GMAW- M process for parcial fusion depth. Eduardo Car- los da Silva, Cofap. This paper presents the research and development of a problem solution that consists in the fault of fusion depth in the inferior fixa- tion of McPherson's shock absorbers which could occur an assem- bly break when in use, possibly resulting in serious accidents. This started by the necessity to improve the welding process sta- bility and to warrant totally the quality of these welded joints. Primely, we made an empirical development where we change the size of the utilized wire to a great one, that proportionated an increase in the electric arc characteristics, resulting in the desired quality and a productivity gain using only the open arc time. We used, in this work, automatic equipment provided with weld- ing digital pulsated sources and hydraulic movement to welded assemblage. So we obtained a good result in one type, mainly and afterwards we made a mathematical modeling based on the heat input and mass input of the joint, making possible to calculate the welding parame- ters to other products. 942425. Creep predicting in polymeric materials. Roberto Ramos, Jr. and Ronaldo B. Salvangni, Escola Politecnica - USP. A structural analysis program involving the finite element method was developed and tested for predicting time-dependent strains in polymeric materials. A generalized Maxwell model was used to provide the material constitutive equation. At each time interval, the equilibrium equations were solved by using the stress integration method. Three element types were implemented: truss, beam and plane stress elements. The numerical results obtained were compared with experimental ones given in the literature, show- ing a good performance of the proposed method. 942426. Quick face lift: thermoformed parts. Joao G. A. David and Ruy A. Bley, Jr., Plascar. This paper describes economical and technical viability of vac- uum forming process on the main product considering development phases. It demonstrates that vacuum formed parts may ensure the same quality level of other processes as long as certain cares are taken during product development and manufacturing and compares its costs to other processes. A vacuum formed bumper is shown as an example. 942428. The performance of NHBR and low temperature HNBR in various automotive parts. Michael J. Recchio, Zeon Chemicals. A variety of current and developmental automotive fluids were evaluated to determine their effects on Hydrogenated Nitrite Butadi- ene Rubber (HNBR), and low temperature HNBR (LT- HNBR) compounds to assist in predicting their performance in automotive sealing applications. This study provides the materials and design engineer with a concise overview of elastomer performance in these fluids and demonstrates the unique attributes of HNBR elastomers. This new family of polymers provides the benchmark for enhanced performance in automotive seals by extending the functional operat- ing range and sealing capabilities while still offering a price/ performance advantage over high priced specialty elastomers. 942429. Organization and performance of new products development in Brazilian auto industry. Sergio Luis da Silva, Universidade Federal De Sao Carlos. The scope of this work is to indicate critical organization and management features present in the development of new high per- formance products. A theoretical approach will be presented, fol- lowed by a case study which will allow illustration of some of these features. The development of new models is fundamental for the competi- tiveness of industries. The importance of this work for the design topics is to point out the critical features which should be adequately managed to structurize and integrated organization with superior performance in the development of new products. 942430. PROMETHEUS - A cooperative effort of the Euro- pean automotive manufacturers. Hans-Benz Glathe, Daimler- Benz AG - Alemanha. Social and economic welfare of modern societies are founded on a well functioning industry and transportation system. Transport must secure that people and goods arrive cost efficient on reliable time a their destination. The European Communities, today the European Union and many member states on national basis enhance productivity and competitivity on both industry and transportation by publicly funded research programs. Joint research has proven effective and efficient. In Germany, since more than 30 years joint research in the precompetitive area of internal combustion engines is tradition. Since the late 70' s a Joint Research Committee on the European platform has extended joint research to other areas of the vehicle technology. Thus it was a kind of evolution when Daimler- Benz AG started the initiative in 1985 to establish the framework for PROMETHEUS. Recently, EUCAR has been founded, an orga- nization of the European Automotive Manufacturers to extend their joint activities from precompetitive research to prede velopment and manufacturing technologies in this industry. Public support was obtained through the EUREKA initiative and funds from national governments. Later, PROMETHEUS compa- nies negotiated with the Commission of the European Communities and supported the creation of the DRIVE Program, part of the third Framework Program for Research and Technology Development. DRIVE stands for Dedicated Road Infrastructure for Vehicle Safety in Europe. This program supported parts of the PROMETHEUS Program. Today, within the fourth Framework Program for Research, Technology Development, and Demonstration the focus of the activities aims at innovations and markets. After eight years of effective and efficient work in PROME- THEUS this phase will terminate by the end of this year. Communi- cation and information technologies have been tested which allow better transport management. Through PROMETHEUS a step for- ward had been initiated which had many followers in the USA - Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems -and in Japan. Tools are avail- able for implementation of sophisticated transport management measures. Decisions how to apply these tools have still to be taken! The thirteen PROMETHEUS companies consider this joint effort as a success. With this experience the automotive manufactur- ers are about to launch a more specific four years PROGRAM FOR 295</page><page sequence="295">942430-942469 MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT IN EUROPE - PROMOTE. Under this program, electronics and components suppliers will join in more actively from the beginning. It is also to address problems not yet solved. Through PROMETHEUS and consequently DRIVE - ' Transport Telematics' ' - implementation of sophisticated transport management is on the agenda of politicians - Council of Transport Ministers of the European Union - and of private companies together with regions and municipalities in Europe. Cooperation is a must! A mental shift to extend collaboration also in other areas and develop strong partnerships among authorities and private orga- nizations active and concerned in the wide area of transportation is necessary. Consensus is needed among society at large, industry, unions, and policy to go onto the next step on our way to a future goal. Vision will provide the power and direction of our actions. 942465. (P-287) Mathematical simulation of driver and restraint systems in racing saloon car impacts. Matthew Grant and Mike Kenefeck, MIRA. MADYMO 3D software was used to model a racing driver with helmet, racing harness and competition seat, and to evaluate injury parameters in a racing saloon car under European Type Approval impact conditions. Parametric changes in the safety systems were evaluated. The systems protected the driver well, although high neck torques were predicted in frontal impact. Loads on the head restraint were substantially higher than the strength required in regulations. In side impact the head passed through the open window. A win- dow net prevented this, but the predicted loads exceeded the strength of a net tested in the laboratory. 942466. (P-287) Biomechanical evaluation and driver experi- ence with the head and neck support. Robert P. Hubbard, Michi- gan State Univ.; Paul C. Begeman, Wayne State Univ.; and James R. Downing, Downing/Atlanta, Inc. Auto and boat racers suffer fatigue and injury from loading of their necks. While racing, a driver's neck often becomes fatigued because it must support the weight of the head and helmet. In crashes, extreme motions of a driver's unrestrained head relative to the restrained torso cause excessive loads in the driver's neck. These neck loads between the head and torso can cause severe or fatal inju- ries such as spinal dislocations and basilar skull fractures. A new type of head and neck support has been developed that restrains the driver's head relative to their torso to reduce undesir- able head motions and neck loads that cause fatigue and injury. This paper describes recent work using computer crash simula- tions, crash dummy tests, and driver experiences to better under- stand head and neck injury in racing and to evaluate the performance of a new head and neck support. 942467. (P-287) On optimum racing helmets. R. W. McLay, Stark BXP ; J. B. McQuillen, Consultants in Forensic Medicine; D. G. Wilder, University of Iowa; and M. K. Molloy, University of Ver- mont. The design of a racing helmet is examined. The fundamentals behind the technology are shown to be rooted in cavitation and fluid pumping of the cerebral spinal fluid and angular acceleration of the brain tissue due to a rapid momentum exchange between the body and the head. Following discussion of the fundamental equations, the paper turns to the function of the helmet in providing a ramp for the acceleration pulse. The design of a helmet is addressed from the standpoint of analysis. 942468. (P-287) Protection of drivers and spectators from pit entrance injuries incurred during loss of control accidents. Kevin H. Forbes, Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corp.; and L. Dan- iel Metz , University of Illinois. At Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS), as well as at a large number of other tracks and temporary racing circuits, the pit lane is separated from the racing surface itself by a wall. The wall is intended to reduce the dangers to pit crew members, spectators and racers themselves, and to prevent interaction between racing and pit- ted cars. We examine the effectiveness of an attenuation device placed at the head end of the pit wall at IMS. Calculations are presented which show that the device can reduce the potential for injury to drivers by absorbing kinetic energy, by distributing the impact load over a large car area and by reducing and smoothing the acceleration pulse presented to the driver. Because driver restraint systems are not designed for high-g lateral loading, this attenuation represents a real safety feature in the case of a sliding situation. The device itself was (inadvertently) tested by a NASCAR vehicle during a practice ses- sion at IMS. Through a video analysis and data acquired from timing devices imbedded in the track surface, the accident was recon- structed and the wall attenuation device performance was compared to expected results. A simple calculation addresses the potential for ablative or nonablative padding of the entire wall surface of a com- plete race-track such as IMS. Energies involved, nominal material sizes needed, and a discussion of the qualitative effects of a wall contact are presented. Two types of wall contact can be considered, (a) a brush-by or wall sideswipe accident, in which the vehicle velocity vector is nearly parallel to the wall surface, and (b) an impact where the velocity vector is at a significant angle with respect to the wall (but still at an acute angle). The impossibility of a "head-on" collision at IMS, or at nearly every other racing venue, is shown. Worst-case scenarios were evaluated at IMS. Spectator and pit crew safety were addressed. The potential for launching a car upward and out over the actual racing surface, or into the pits, or even into the spectator stands is discussed and shown to be very small. The attenuator device was specially designed and constructed to minimize this possibility, and the construction tech- niques used are presented. Although the single accident which occurred was a (relatively) low-speed accidents, results were prom- ising in view of what was expected. Finally, a series of 1/8 scale radio-controlled model vehicle experiments were conducted against prototypical wall padding materials for estimation of potential for bounceback of vehicles into the racing stream. Photographs and video of the contacts are avail- able, and a cataloging of results is presented. The results reported here on attenuation devices are applicable to all racing locations where pit walls are employed, and the final section of the paper has relevance for all tracks where car-to-wall contacts are possible and/or likely. 942469. (P-287) Evasive maneuver capability without an in the presence of a flat tire. I. Daniel Metz and Troy S. Torbeck, Uni- versity of Illinois; and L. Gregory Metz, Consulting Engineer. The relatively fragile nature of racing tires, coupled with the inevitable track debris which results from racing accidents, ensures that racing drivers will routinely experience conditions involving flat tire vehicle dynamics, we define flat tire vehicle dynamics as a situation which requires the driver to provide steering and/or brak- ing and acceleration control while the vehicle is running on one or more tires which have dramatically reduced tire pressure. In the present work, we simulate the handling and braking vehi- cle dynamics which occur in the presence of a single flat tire on the vehicle. The flat tire was simulated via drastically reduced cornering stiffness, partially reduced limiting frictional capability and increased rolling resistance, and was alternatively simulated on both the front and rear axle. No simulations were conducted with more than a single flat tire because multiple tire failures which do not involve an actual accident contact and/or damage are rare. NASCAR vehicle and tire data were used through the simulations. No attempt was made to model restraining devices which prevent a flat tire from becoming separated from the rim; all flat tires were assumed to remain in place. A three-degree-of-freedom (3df) handling model employing sideslip, yaw and forward velocity degrees of freedom was used to compute vehicle trajectories and time histories. The model was 296</page><page sequence="296">942469-942480 implemented using the (somewhat restrictive but highly useful) EDSVS software analysis program. Both fixed steering control and active steering control maneuvers were simulated in the form of emergency braking and double-lane-change maneuvers. Vehicle aerodynamic properties (downforce/lift and/or drag) were not included in any of the simulations. Aerodynamic downforce coeffi- cients, drag and lift are know to be extremely strong functions of ride height, pitch angle and yaw angle with respect to direction of travel. It is likely that a flat tire would disturb all three of these highly optimized conditions. Simulation results showed that relatively rich handling and brak- ing maneuvers can still be successfully completed even with a flat tire, and depending upon the axle location of the flat tire. Evasive capability and braking distance, while diminished, still retain mod- est levels of reserve for all but dramatic maneuvering strategies. 942470. (P-287) Methods and instruments for on-board mea- surement of tire/road friction. Bert Breuer , Thomas Bachmann, Stefan Ernesti, and Jörg Stöcker, Technische Hochschule Darm- stadt. Tire/road friction determines which driving maneuvers are physi- cally possible and is, therefore, of utmost importance for vehicle safety. At the Department of Automotive Engineering (Head: Prof. Dr.-Ing. B. Breuer) of Darmstadt University (THD) research on the on-board measurement of tire/road friction was started in 1988 and has since then been funded by Deutsche Forschungs-Gemeinschaft (DFG) and within the European research project PROMETHEUS. Methods and instruments described in this paper represent its pres- ent state. Two different methods of friction detection are proposed: one computes a p-slip-curve from contactless measurements of the road surface, the other derives friction from signals gained inside the tire. Besides several influences on the friction level, which are mea- sured in their entirety on real roads under natural conditions, some effects of local tire behavior are discussed. 942474. (P-288) A feasibility study of the Ford 4.6L, 4-valve modular, V8 engine for use in road racing applications. Dan Yerace, Ford Motor Co.; and Dennis Corn, Roush Industries. This paper describes the joint effort between Ford Motor Com- pany, Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) and Roush Industries to investigate the feasibility of making a production Ford 4.6L, 4- valve modular, V8 engine into a 600 BHP road racing engine. All areas of the production engine design were addressed due to the anticipated increase in power and engine speed. No attempt was made to obtain race level durability or specific vehicle packaging. The test results showed that the objective power level was achieved at lower than anticipated engine speed. In addition, the torque values and band width were consistent with current road rac- ing engine performance levels. In summary, the Ford 4.6L, 4-valve modular, V8 engine can be developed into a competitive road racing engine. 942475. (P-288) Traction control for a Formula 1 race car - Conceptual design, algorithm development, and calibration methodology. Kim Lyon, Chrysler Corp.; and Matthias Philipp and Erwin Grommes, Robert Bosch GmbH. A Traction Control (TC) system was developed for a Formula 1 racing car using PID closed-loop feedback control of available engine power using a sophisticated fuel cutoff algorithm. Slip events were identified from four-wheel speed data as well as driver cock- pit-selectable input. This paper deals with both theoretical system design and algorithm development during the 1993 Fl season. In addition, development of a unique, G.P. start-only feature is dis- cussed. Results indicate the existence of a minimum slip level, below which vehicle performance is impaired even though near-perfect slip reduction is achieved. Mathematical representation of the quan- tity of slip as a velocity delta is also important to ensure uniform system response in the face of changing track surface conditions. 942476. (P-288) Dynamometer testing of a Formula 1 engine: the equipment, procedures and problems. Giuseppe Mancuso, Lamborghini Engineering SpA. Formula 1 engines have some peculiarities which present unique challenges and problems when they are tested on the dynamometer. Traditional methods of testing have been adapted to this particular case, and special procedures and new methodologies have been introduced to assure the reliability and the accuracy of the results. Many years of experience have allowed Lamborghini Engineer- ing to verify the effectiveness of their equipment and procedures, and thereby overcome the difficulties associated with the need to get accurate data in as short a time period as possible. This paper describes the facilities and procedures used, and dis- cusses some of the problems encountered in testing this very spe- cialized type of engine. 942477. (P-288) What is limiting your engine air flow: using normalized steady air flow bench data. Daniel D. Agnew, General Motors Powertrain. Data from steady air-flow bench tests is made more useful during engine design and development when they are normalized for criti- cal geometric parameters. The procedure is illustrated in the study described here. Using prescribed test and data reduction methods, steady air-flow data was collected from a broad spectrum of high- performance race engines. The resulting database then offered a benchmark against which a new engine was evaluated, and direc- tions for future development were made clear. 942478. (P-288) Acceleration test method for a high- performance, two-stroke racing engine. Robert J. Kee and Gor- don P. Blair, Queen's University of Belfast. This paper describes an inertial dynamometer system which has been applied to the testing of small, two-stroke, kart, racing engines. The dynamometer incorporates a flywheel of appropriate moment of inertia to simulate the mass of a kart and driver. The test proce- dure involves measurement of the flywheel speed during an acceler- ation phase resulting from opening the throttle. Calculation of the instantaneous flywheel acceleration corresponding to each engine speed directly gives a measure of the torque and power characteris- tics. Performance results, including exhaust pressure traces, are presented from a series of tests conducted on a 100 cm3 kart engine. The results are compared with corresponding steady state measure- ments recorded on an eddy current dynamometer. In addition, the measured results are compared with predictions from a computer simulation. 942479. (P-287) A physiological profile of high-performance, race car drivers. James W. Lighthall, General Motors R&amp;D Cen- ter ; John Pierce, General Motors Motorsports Technology Group; and Stephen E. Olvey, CART/IndyCar Safety Team. This paper updates our continuing research program examining the physiological performance of professional race car drivers. Data is presented from a comparative study examining the heart rate of different drivers in the Indy Lights race series. Each driver was mon- itored during practice, qualifying and race sessions on a short oval track (one mile) and a road course track. The effect of track type on physiological performance is addressed. Physiological data recorded during the Indianapolis 500 race and from practice and qualifying sessions for this event are shown. Technical difficulties involved in accurately measuring heart rate (HR) in the race car environment are addressed. 942480. (P-287) Analysis of 1994 Indianapolis 500-mile race and practice accidents. L. Daniel Metz , University of Illinois; and Kevin H. Forbes, Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corp. During the month of May, 1994, there were a total of 15 acci- dents at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS). Of this total, six accidents occurred during practice and/or qualifications attempts and nine occurred during the 78th running of the Indianapolis 500- mile race. 297</page><page sequence="297">942480-942492 All six practice accidents were analyzed through the use of videography, skidmark measurements, photographs, angle of wall impact (if a wall impact occurred), vehicle damage and yaw angle measurements. The accidents were categorized according to type and severity, mechanical failure or driver error, speed at the initia- tion of the accident sequence, driver injury (if injuries occurred), weather, track and traffic conditions. Race accidents were also ana- lyzed. The sudy represents the continuation of a long-term program to catalog, analyze and reconstruct accidents at IMS. Here, we present the second year of this serious effort at accident analysis, and intro- duce an increased level of rigor in categorization, data collection and data analysis. 942482. (P-287) Racing car restraint system frontal crash performance testing. John W. Melvin, William C. Little, Edward A. Jędrzejczak, and John Pierce, General Motors Corp. This paper presents the results of a series of over 30 impact sled simulations of racing car frontal crashes conducted as part of the GM Motorsports Safety Technology Research Program. A Hyge™ impact sled fitted with a simulated racing car seat and restraint sys- tem was used to simulate realistic crash loading with a mid-size male Hybrid III dummy. The results of tests, in the form of mea- sured loads, displacements, and accelerations, are presented and comparisons made with respect to the levels of these parameters seen in typical passenger car crash testing and to current injury threshold values. 942483. (P-287) A model driven approach to race car data acquisition. Douglas L. Replogle, Applied Vehicle Sciences, Inc. The proliferation of channels in on-board, race car, data systems has produced quantities of data too large to be analyzed and acted upon in the time frame required for race team decision making. This paper discusses the requirements for an analytical model capable of tracking under and oversteer behavior of a racing chassis under real- world conditions. Several potential algorithms are discussed and evaluated. 942484. (P-287) The magic of the drag tire. Chuck Hallum, Hallum Racing Enterprises. A theoretical model of the drag tire is presented and performance predictions of fuel drag cars is compared to race car data. The data comparison, in both magnitude and trends, substantiate the proposed Tread Momentum principle. Top fuel drag cars accelerate at over four "g's" for several sec- onds. The effective tire friction factor based on car weight is over four. But the average friction coefficient between the tire and the ground is less than two. The Tread Momentum principle explains how drag tire dynamics gives added traction capability. High torque and power are required to generate the added traction capability. The principle can lead to improved high-speed, race tire performance in other fields. 942485. (P-287) Oversteer/understeer characteristics of a locked differential. Patrick Hopkins and L. Daniel Metz , University of Illinois. The type of differential used in a vehicle has an important and often-neglected effect on handling performance. This is particularly important in racing applications, such as in IndyCar racing, in which the type of differential chosen depends on the course being raced (superspeedway ovals, short ovals, temporary street courses and per- manent road courses). In the present work, we examine the effect of a locked rear differential on oversteer/understeer behavior. Using a linear tire model, it is shown that employing a locked differential ads a constant understeer offset to the steering wheel angle (SWA) -v-lateral acceleration vehicle signature. A computer simulation of steady- state cornering behavior showed that the actual effect is much more complicated, and is strongly influenced by static weight distribution, front/rear roll couple distribution, available traction and the radius of the turn being negotiated. Testing performed on a formula SAE racing car was used to ver- ify the simulation results, and to examine limit-performance differ- ences between theory and experiment. 942486. (P-288) Chaos analysis on in-cylinder pressure mea- surements. L. Chew, R. L. Hoekstra, J. F. Nayfeh, and J. E. Navedo, University of Central Florida. Peak pressure, crank angle and induction pressure were mea- sured in cylinder number one of a Ford 4.6 liter Modular engine. Chaos analysis has been conducted on these measurements and the phase, waveform, Poincare, and FFT plots are presented. These plots show conclusively that the pressure fluctuation inside a cylin- der is a broadband chaos. 942487. (P-288) Cylinder-pressure-based combustion analy- sis in race engines. Andrew L. Randolph, General Motors Corp. Development of race engines has traditionally been a very hard- ware-intensive process. This is particularly true when trying to max- imize the performance of a given engine. The engine developer must identify the inadequately designed components, and then attempt to optimally redesign them. Cylinder-pressure-based combustion diagnostics can help iden- tify the performance-limiting componentry, and can provide direc- tion for the redesign of that componentry. However, effective analy- sis requires that exacting care be taken when instrumenting the engine, acquiring the data, and interpreting the results. This memo addresses each of these facets of the analysis, and discusses applica- tions of cylinder-pressure-based diagnostics such as structural load- ing, air-flow distribution, cycle-by-cycle and cylinder-by-cylinder torque variability, individual cylinder losses due to non-optimum spark timing, selection of optimum fuel-injection timing, response to throttle transients, and quantification of burn rate. 942488. (P-288) Optimizing race engine performance one cyl- inder at a time. Andrew L. Randolph, General Motors Corp. Performance of multicylinder engines is dictated by the sum of the contributions from the individual cylinders, each of which must be optimized to maximize the total output. Cylinder-to- cylinder imbalance causes each cylinder to operate differently, making indi- vidual-cylinder optimization a challenge. Unfortunately, cylinder- to-cylinder imbalance exists in all multicylinder engines, even those in which careful steps are taken in design and manufacturing to pre- vent it. While optimizing each cylinder of a multicylinder engine in high- volume production applications is not feasible, it is feasible in racing applications and can provide a significant competitive advan- tage. This paper investigates causes of cylinder-to-cylinder imbalance and discusses techniques to optimize race engine performance one cylinder at a time through the systematic optimization of individual- cylinder intake valve closing, spark timing, and compression ratio. 942491. (P-287) Power versus efficiency for land speed record vehicles. Douglas C. Kruse, Thermadyne Research Corp.; and George M. Wallace, B&amp;M Automotive Products. A computer simulation program has been developed to evaluate vehicle performance for record attempts at the Bonnevile Salt Flats in Utah, USA. A nine mile long straight line course is expected to be available in good weather conditions. Performance data from the unlimited automobile speed record holder is reviewed for compari- son with projected speed versus distance plots of a proposed new vehicle. The record being challenged, 246 mph, is for a limited displace- ment vehicle of 2.0 liters or less. The analysis provides comparative results for several techniques for enhanced performance. 942492. (P-287) Race car performance optimization. Joseph C. La Joie, N/A. Vehicle dynamics handling analysis has been performed on a personal computer through incorporation of a closed form solution of the differential equations of motion. When compared to numeri- 298</page><page sequence="298">942492-942502 cal integration procedures, this method affords the advantages of speed and stability knowledge provided by the characteristic roots of these equations. The constrained boundary value solution assumed piece-wise continuous, quasi-dynamic intervals of interest. Tire property deriv- atives followed previous methods developed by Pacejka. Aerody- namic lift, drag, and center of pressure were described as coeffi- cients of several variables. Engine and transmission characteristics were modeled also. The method has been applied to an imaginary race car. Variables included camber, ride height, ride pitch, wing angle, Gurney Flap length, and gear ratios. 942493. (P-287) Development of a low-emissions, high-output engine conversion. Mark S. McPhail, General Motors Corp. A comprehensive engine conversion package was developed to meet the divergent goals of increased vehicle performance while complying with vehicle emission control regulations for 1982-87 Chevrolet Camaros. Development revolved around revising a GM 5.7L Small Block off-road, emissions-exempt engine assembly to improve engine idle quality and low-speed torque while maintaining off-road power output. The power output of the 5.7L engine drove upgrades in the remaining vehicle components, including the sys- tem, engine controller calibration, induction/exhaust systems, and transmission calibration. 942494. (P-287) The future of motorsports engineering - Versus politics, budgets, and show business. Paul Van Valken- burgh, Consultant. "Formula NONE" is proposed as a solution to the problem of sanctioning bodies increasingly restricting the practice of motor- sports engineering, supposedly to reduce costs, increase safety, and equalize competition - but which reduces the value of engineers. Even in Formula One there are dozens of technologies banned out- right, not to mention all the dimensional limits. A few "megabuck" sponsors allow some teams to attain an unfair technological advan- tage. However, a series with NO technical rules except for impact safety (speeds limited by track changes), might be feasible if all team advertising were banned, letting innovation flourish in a real Constructors Championship. 942495. (P-287) Comparison of full-scale wing, wind tunnel test to scale-model test for open-wheel race cars. Mary J. Berchak and Michael W. Camosy , Ohio State Univ. This paper addresses the question if testing wing-alone configu- rations has a place in the design process of an open-wheel race car. Data from 40% models and stand-alone, full-size, wings are com- pared to determine if wing-alone testing is a good predictor of per- formance when the wing is mounted on the car. 942497. (P-287) Modern wind tunnel testing of Indy cars. D. W. Hurst, University of Southampton. The extensive use of wind tunnels in the aerodynamic develop- ment of race cars started during the 1970's. At this early stage, large gains in performance could be achieved using simple models and standard testing techniques. However, with continuing development the gains that could be achieved became progressively smaller as the overall aerodynamic performance improved. This has required the development of complex, fully representative models which include, for example, correct radiator simulation and working sus- pension. The need for detailed aerodynamic data has resulted in the employment of advanced testing techniques. In addition to accurate force and surface pressure measurements, the flowfield characteris- tics around the car are measured using a laser doppler anemometry system. This paper presents a description of current testing techniques employed in the development of the Penske Indy Car during tests in the University of Southampton 3.5 x 2.6m wind tunnel. 942498. (P-287) Application of computational methods to the aerodynamic development of a prototype race car. Joseph Katz , San Diego State Univ.; and Lee Dykstra, Special Chassis Inc. A three-dimensional computer simulation technique was com- bined with wind-tunnel testing during the aerodynamic development of an enclosed-wheel prototype race car. This approach proved that valuable time can be saved by investigating some of the important design parameters before a vehicle is built. One of the major advan- tages of a computational approach is that it contains information such as pressure or velocity distribution on and near the whole vehi- cle. This abundance of data is essential for understanding major design trends and sensitivities, and can steer the design toward fruit- ful modifications. Once the vehicle's body plan is finalized, the method can be used to further modify local details and to design and position a complicated rear wing cluster. At this phase of wing design, the availability of the pressure distribution on the entire wing surfaces is vital to a successful design. Since such information is readily available from computational tools, valuable wind- tunnel time is saved, and vehicle development cycle is shortened. 942500. (P-288) Rotary valve system for a four-cycle, G-Kart racing engine. Norman D. Storer and Todd Nelson, Western Michi- gan Univ. The mechanical aspects of a Rotary Valve System (RVS) are evaluated considering the operating conditions of a single- cylinder four-cycle engine. Design of valve geometry, sealing mechanism, and drive mechanism are discussed as well as their impact on the performance of the baseline engine. In order to understand the full capabilities of the RVS, a study of the limitations of the baseline, valve train system is performed. This information is then used to establish the minimum requirements of the RVS design. Once the shaft diameter, the port diameter, and the internal shaft passages are determined, the flow is analyzed using a computational fluid dynamics approach. The increased flow of the RVS is expected to increase volumetric efficiency and engine speeds. Even though the RVS is still a concept, when operational it will give four-cycle karters the opportunity to enjoy more powerful engines. 942501. (P-288) Optimal rocker arm design in high-speed, internal combustion engines. J. W. David and Yimin Wei, North Carolina State Univ.; and J. A. Covey, General Motors Corp. One of the primary objectives of building an automotive engine is to produce sufficient power throughout its most common operat- ing range. The objective of this study is to determine how maximum engine speed may be increased through rocker arm modification. Current knowledge suggests that there are two primary factors in the design of rocker arms that will effect the engine's operating speed: the mass moment of inertia and the stiffness. Experimental and computational methods were used to investigate the influence of these two factors on valve train performance. The ANSYS Finite Element package Design Optimization Rou- tine was used to optimize the design of a typical Chevrolet NASCAR rocker arm and one used in the Buick V6 Indy Engine. Also investigated was the use of various materials for rocker arm construction. 942502. (P-288) Optimal design of high-speed, valve train sys- tems. J. W. David, North Carolina State Univ.; Dojoong Kim, Ulsan Univ.; and J. A. Covey, General Motors Corp. One of the major tendencies in engine design is to increase oper- ating speed. In order to increase engine speed, the importance of valve train design and dynamic behavior becomes crucial. Optimal design of the system can result in improved dynamic characteristics. A valve train design methodology is developed in this paper that incorporates an efficient, accurate dynamic system model in the design procedure. The cam profile is synthesized using eight poly- nomial equations cast in terms of nine non-dimensional parameters which are to be optimized. The objective function is cast so as to minimize the residual vibration amplitude of the valve. Several con- 299</page><page sequence="299">942502-94251 1 straints are included such as event duration, maximum tappet lift, maximum tappet velocity, and maximum tappet acceleration. An adaptive random search technique is used to seek global opti- mal solutions to the problem. The design methodology was applied to a typical NASCAR valve train and significant increases in engine speed were obtained. 942503. (P-288) Torsional vibration analysis of belt-driven camshafts in a high-speed IC engine. Brian E. Mitchell , General Motors Powertrain; Joseph W. David, North Carolina State Univ.; and James A. Covey, General Motors Motorsports Technology Group. An experimental method was developed to dynamically measure rigid-body camshaft torsional vibrations in a high-speed, internal combustion engine. A mathematical model of the system was also created which required an accurate dynamic model of the entire valve train to predict the forcing function. Techniques for limiting the vibration were also implemented and tested. While attempting to correlate the experimental and theoretical results, it was discovered that the rubber timing belt exhibits visco- elastic behavior. The system stiffness and damping coefficients are frequency dependent. A system identification was required to accu- rately determine these parameters. No distinct relation between camshaft torsional vibrations and valve response was determined for the system studied. However, significant vibration reduction was achieved with a camshaft damper and an inertia addition to the camshaft. 942504. (P-287) Use of simulation to tune race car dampers. James L. Kasprzak, Race Suspension Technologies, Inc.; and R. Scott Floyd, Clemson Univ. Having a well-balanced suspension in race cars is critical to a team's success in every race series. The ability of the suspension to keep all four tires in contact with the racing surface over bumps and through turns is crucial. A key component controlling these factors is the dampers. One method used to assess the damper performance, besides on track testing, is the four-post vibration rig test. This test involves placing the vehicle on a four-post test stand that inputs pre- scribed forces to the four tiers. Acceleration measurements are made on the car during this test and frequency response plots can be gener- ated to evaluate the vertical dynamic response of the vehicle. While very useful, the four-post rig testing is expensive both in terms of race team time and costs. This inspired us to develop a computer simulation of this test that would allow the user to quickly run through many damper and suspension configurations and ana- lyze the predicted vertical dynamic response of the vehicle. Both lin- ear and non-liner computer simulation models were developed, with the non-liner model using actual force versus velocity characteristics for the dampers as measured from cyclic testing. Simulation results show good correlation between the actual four-post vibration testing and simulation results for an IMSA GTP car. The simulations were also used to tune the dampers of an Indy Lights Lola car by altering the existing damper characteristics to get the desired dynamic response of the vehicle. This procedure was used successfully in the 1993 Indy Lights racing series to tune the dampers for the cars of one team. 942505. (P-287) Modeling steady-state suspension kinematics and vehicle dynamics of road racing cars. Part I: theory &amp; methodology. Thomas C. Crahan, N/A. This paper presents basic suspension kinematics and vehicle dynamics concepts along with the equations necessary to model the steady-state handling behavior of road racing cars on a personal computer. Definitions for roll center, the roll resistance contribution of springs and anti-roll bars, and instantaneous motion ratios are refined. These refined definitions correct several assumptions pres- ent in the classic design methods which lead to erroneous modeling results. These design methods and modeling equations are valid for the unequal length non-parallel type passive suspensions commonly found in competition vehicles. This paper is part one in a two-part series. The second paper (S AE Paper #942506) includes the design specifications and model- ing results for a CART Indy car, IMSA GTS car, and two Formula Fords. The computer model used to study the handling behavior of these cars was created with the methods and equations described in part one. 942506. (P-287) Modeling steady -state suspension kinematics and vehicle dynamics of road racing cars. Part II: examples. Thomas C. Crahan, N/A. The methods and equations presented in Part I (SAE Paper #942505) were used to create a steady-state vehicle simulation pro- gram which runs on a personal computer. This program models the kinematic and dynamic behavior of road racing vehicles which use unequal length A arm suspensions. It is capable of modeling the out- board spring, rocker-arm, pull-rod and push-rod suspension types commonly found in road racing vehicles. Steady-state reactions to lateral, longitudinal and vertical accelerations are calculated for a vehicle, based on its basic design specifications. Sample designs for a CART Indy car, IMSA GTS car and two properly and poorly designed Formula Fords are provided along with their computer generated modeling results. 942507. (P-287) Computer-aided racing car design and devel- opment at the University of Brescia, Italy. Danilo Cambiaghi and Marco Gadola, University of Brescia. The time of the 4 'magic touch" approach to race car design is nearly over, and modern engineering techniques are more and more employed in high-level racing. Finite Element Analysis, Computa- tional Fluid Dynamics, and Vehicle Dynamics are some of the com- puter-aided methods which are being successfully applied to improve engine performance, aerodynamics, structural effectiveness and driveability. People at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Uni- versity of Brescia have been working on chassis and suspension modeling in cooperation with racing and sports car makers and lead- ing-edge teams since 1989. Current research partners are the Fiat Research Center (CRF), Dallara Racing Cars, the Scuderia Italia Touring Car Team, and others. 942509. (P-287) Two-dimensional airfoil in ground effect, an experimental and computational study. Robert Ranzenback and Jewel B. Barlow, G.L.M. Wind Tunnel. A critical aspect of the performance of the front wing of a For- mula One or Indy race car is studied by idealizing them as a sym- metric two-dimensional airfoil operating in ground effect. When such an airfoil operates at heights roughly equal to the airfoil thick- ness and lower, measurable amounts of negative force are generated. As the height continues to decrease, there is an expected force rever- sal. There are two objectives of the study reported in this paper. The first is the adequate verification of the Finite-Analytic Navier- Stokes computational approach by comparing computational results for the case of a stationary airfoil at various heights above ground to experimental results. The second is to elucidate the force reversal phenomena for the specific case of a NACA 0015 airfoil traveling at high Reynolds number above stationary ground in still air by uti- lizing the validated code. 942511. (P-287) Computer-aided engineering of champion- ship winning linkage suspension. Brian Warner, Arvin Ride Con- trol Products; and D. Rathwell, Yamaha Motorsport. The linkage system of a motorcycle rear suspension is analyzed with a view of increasing the overall performance of the machine as a racing vehicle. The effect of leverage ratio changes on damping and spring stiffness are studied. A parametric variation procedure is performed, using a kinematic analysis program and selection 300</page><page sequence="300">942511-942521 criteria, to redesign the system. Further analysis is performed to define initial stiffness and damping parameters. Finally, track test- ing and tuning is done, resulting in a design which has found usage on a multitude of national championship winning machines. 942514. (P-288) Design of exhaust systems for V-twin motor- cycle engines to meet silencing and performance criteria. G. P. Blair, The Queen's University of Belfast; W. L. Cahoon, University of South Florida; and C. T. Yohpe, Crane Cams, Inc. This paper reports on the use of mathematical modeling by the GPB method of pressure wave propagation through finite systems, for the design of prototype exhaust systems and silencers for a Har- ley-Davidson Motorcycle. The motorcycle engine is the classic 1340 cm3 435° V-twin power unit. The design objectives were to gain mid-range power and torque without loss of performance at either end of the speed range and to design silencers which would enhance the performance and the noise image of the machine. The Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) employed their unsteady gas flow modeling techniques to the design of the system and its silencers to complement a new camshaft design from Crane Cams. The results of the use of these computer-based design tech- niques are reported as performance characteristics of power and torque for the new design by comparison with the stock system. The comparisons reported are both computed performance characteris- tics and for those measured experimentally on a chassis dynamome- ter. Also shown are the computer predictions for the pressure dia- grams at the exhaust valve for the stock and the QUB systems, which pressures heavily influence the ensuing airflow through the engine and the torque which is subsequently attained. The design of the silencers enhances the behavior of wave action within the exhaust system, so that the engine produces more power and less noise with silencers fitted to the QUB system by compari- son with open straight pipes. Measurements are provided to illus- trate this point. 942515. (P-288) A detailed investigation of exhaust system design in high-performance, two-stroke engines. Anthony Cart- wright and Robert Fleck, Queen 's Univ. The performance of two-stroke, high-specific-output engines, is largely dependent on the exhaust system. This paper describes an experimental study on the effect of each of the exhaust pipe sections on the actual engine performance. The exhaust system has been designed with interconnecting flanges that allow the various sec- tions to be bolted together for testing on a dynamometer. This allows numerous combinations of various section designs to be evaluated. In an effort to understand the exact mechanisms involved in the pressure wave action within the engine, several pressure transducers have been located in the intake, crankcase, cylinder and exhaust. 942516. (P-288) Optimization of a 125cc., racing 2-S engine based on modeling and testing. José M. Corberán, Rafael Royo, Antonio Pérez , and Juventino Santiago, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia. In this paper, the results and main conclusions of a R &amp; D project carried out to achieve the highest level of performance in a 125cc., 2-S engine for a World Championship racing motorcycle are pres- ented and discussed. Both computational (Modeling Techniques) and experimental (steady flow rig and motorcycle roller test bench) means have been combined, trying to accomplish the highest degree of optimization. An important improvement in the engine's perfor- mance was obtained as a result. The paper also describes in some detail the organization of the study, the possible strategy of optimization, the characteristics of the new computer code used to perform the calculations of these very difficult engines, and the experimental measurements. 942517. (P-288) The design considerations, design methodol- ogy and materials of the Lamborghini 3.5L Formula 1 engine crankshaft. Fabio Marchetti, Carlo Nicolazzi, and Alberto Catel- lani, Lamborghini Engineering S.p.A. This paper describes the experience accumulated by Lambor- ghini Engineering S.p.A. in crankshaft design and production, ana- lyzing in detail the calculation methodologies, material characteriza- tion, and the definition of the production process. 942518. (P-288) Piston and piston ring design and develop- ment for the Formula 1 engine. Giovanni P. Pietrobello, Marco Cocchi, and Andrea Bolletta, Lamborghini Engineering S.p.A. Some developments and results concerning piston and piston ring of Lamborghini 3.5-liter, V-12, Formula 1 atmospheric engine are reported. Two piston shapes, their materials and problems of using only two piston rings have been analyzed, focusing on friction losses, blow-by control and oil consumption. 942519. (P-288) Dynamic testing and evaluation of the tor- sional vibration absorber. Mike Albright, Roush Anatrol; Tim Crawford, TCI Automotive; and Frank Speckhart, University of Tennessee. The torsional vibration absorber (TVA) is a device which is designed to control torsional crankshaft vibration in piston engines. The TVA is based on the concept of the pendulum absorber and incorporates rollers housed in a circular disc with holes bored in its perimeter. While the tuned damper reduces vibration at a constant frequency, the TVA reduces vibration at a constant order. The paper investigates the effectiveness of the TVA in comparison to the tradi- tional tuned damper and to a viscous damper. The comparisons are conducted both in controlled dynamometer testing and in field tests on two V-8 motors modified for drag racing. 942520. (P-287) The effect of deck spoilers and two-car inter- ference on the body pressures of race cars. Louis T. Duncan, Automotive Aerodynamics, Inc. The aerodynamic development of a race car often includes wind tunnel testing and track testing. Wind tunnel data includes aero forces and moments which are measured by the wind tunnel balance. Track data is usually derived from stop watch and driver "feel." The instrumentation that provides a correlation between wind tunnel and track data is pressure ports. Pressure- port data helps the test engineer understand the reason why a body modification causes a change in the balance data. This paper presents typical pressure-port data measured at the wind tunnel and describes the effects that deck spoilers, yaw, and traffic interference have on balance data and body pressures. 942521. (P-287) Aerodynamic development of a successful NASCAR Winston Cup race car. Terranee D. Laise and Kevin S. Bayless, General Motors Corp. This paper describes the methodology used to achieve optimum aerodynamic performance of the 1989 through 1994 Chevrolet Lumina Winston Cup race car, and demonstrates the continuous improvements successfully used to respond to rule changes and competition. The development will be documented from construc- tion of a prototype race car, through one-third scale model testing, and the detail development required to continually improve perfor- mance and meet changing body rules which stringently limit body modifications. Despite these limitations, track and wind tunnel testing of devel- opment vehicles contributed to driver's and manufacturer's champi- onships in the first racing season. The continuous improvement pro- cess, which includes ongoing wind tunnel and track tests, has resulted in improvement or at least maintenance of drag coefficient along with lift coefficient reduction of up to 0.050 each year. Special test methodologies developed to better understand spe- cific aerodynamic questions such as the effects of vehicle attitude and engine air inlet performance are also discussed. 301</page><page sequence="301">942522-942532 942522. (P-287) The development and manufacture of a roof- mounted, aero flap system for race car applications. Gary Nel- son, National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing ; Jack Roush, Roush Industries, Inc.; Gary Eaker, General Motors Corp.; and Stan Wallis, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes the effort initiated by the National Associa- tion of Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), and joined by General Motors Corporations (GM), Ford Motor Company (FORD) and Roush Industries, Inc. (Roush) to develop and manufacture a roof- mounted, aero flap system (referred hereafter as "roof flaps") for race car applications. This system addresses the problem of how to greatly reduce the severity of accidens involving spinning race cars by means of preventing aerodynamic lift-off. There were several NASCAR race car accidents in 1993 that involved cars which became airborne. A variety of tests and procedures, both inside and outside the wind tunnel environment, were conducted to evaluate and consider possible solutions to this problem. Ultimately, a roof flap system was produced that has significantly reduced extreme yaw lift in race cars. The proof of success of this system has been the virtual elimi- nation of aero lift-off in NASCAR race cars since the introduction of roof flaps, when coupled with previously mandated anti-lift devices, in February 1994. 942523. (P-287) Lateral response of a Formula SAE race car. Kenneth D. Kramer, Ford Motor Co. ; and Dale E. Calkins, Univer- sity of Washington. A computer program which simulates a Formula SAE race car during transient cornering was developed as a design tool. The pro- gram incorporates a non-linear tier model based on empirical tire testing. This allows simulation of vehicle performance at the limits of tire adhesion. The simulation was validated using competition results and an instrumented four-wheel steer (4WS) Formula SAE car. The simulation was used to investigate the dynamic characteris- tics of two mechanical 4 WS systems during severe cornering. Each system was found to improve performance under different condi- tions. Lateral response was found to be independent of body roll for the vehicle studied. 942525. (P-287) Formula 2000 tube frame analysis. Robert S. Ballinger, University of Kentucky; and Brian A. Jones, Consultant. This research outlines a procedure for analyzing the torsional stiffness of a tube frame chassis design. The analysis utilizes finite element model simulation of the tube frame to identify areas where existing member stiffness could be increased or where new mem- bers could be added to result in a significant increase in overall frame stiffness. Key to the procedure is the determination of loca- tions of high-strain energy density for a given load case. These loca- tions of high-strain energy density identify areas where member stiffness can be increased or where additional members could be located. Member stiffness can be increased by increasing the size or the thickness of the tube cross-section. The procedure can be per- formed with linear static analysis, however, more information can be gained when using linear dynamic analysis. The procedure can ultimately be combined with structural optimization to yield a frame design having maximum stiffness and minimum weight. The analy- ses presented herein concern a Formula 2000 tube frame chassis design. It should be noted that the analysis is also applicable and appropriate for other tube frame chassis designs or monocoque chas- sis designs. 942526. (P-287) Applications of finite element analysis in the design of the Mazda RX-792P GTP race car. John Crawford, Consultant; and Lee Dykstra, Special Chassis, Inc. This paper addresses the application of finite element analysis during the design of the Mazda RX-792P IMSA GTP race car. Examples are provided which illustrate the application and results of using finite element analysis as an integral part of the design pro- cess. All problems discussed in this paper are static, structural prob- lems. 942527. (P-287) Finite element analysis of a NASCAR Win- ston Cup stock car. John Crawford, Consultant. This paper presents an investigation into the torsional stiffness of a NASCAR Winston Cup stock car chassis using finite element analysis. A measurement of torsional stiffness was made on a representa- tive chassis, which also provided the dimensions for constructing a finite element model. The experimental measurement was used to verify the finite element model, which was then used to evaluate the effect of various design changes on torsional stiffness. Tables and charts are presented which describe chassis flexibility for each design change which was analyzed. 942528. (P-288) Evaluation of reed valves in high- performance, two-stroke engines. Robert Fleck, Alan McGregor, and Paul A. Harrington, Queen 's Univ. The operation of high-performance, two-stroke engines is highly dynamic and requires the interaction of many components and phe- nomena to realize maximum performance. The reed induction valve is one such component whose operation can be influenced by many parameters. This paper describes the design of a test apparatus which allows the reed valve performance to be evaluated in isolation from the multitude of engine variables. Several reed valve configu- rations are tested and results presented and discussed for reed tip motion and overall airflow. 942529. (P-288) Turbocharged, spark ignition, two-stroke engine. Ken Hardman, University of Illinois. This paper will describe an experimental investigation into the performance of a turbocharged, spark ignition, two-stroke engine. A turbocharging system that incorporates electronic fuel injection, a water to air intercooler, and an expansion chamber exhaust system, has been designed and tested on a 500cm3, four- cylinder, crankcase scavenged spark ignition engine. The engine system has been devel- oped to power a Land Speed vehicle where high specific power out- put is of utmost importance. Results from dynamometer testing will be presented along with racing results of an open-wheeled Lakester class car at the Bonneville Salt Flats. 942530. (P-288) Performance turbocharger failure analysis - Causes and solutions. Robert Keller, Turbonetics, Inc.; and Joseph Scharrer and Phillip Mosher, Rotordynamics-Seal Research. Improvements in performance turbocharger durability can be attained by analyzing both the physical and dynamic aspects of tur- bocharger failure observations. Design consideration of the severe operational environment to which a performance turbocharger is exposed can add significantly to its probability of survival. 942531. (P-288) An analysis of the probable effects of engine geometry on the inlet pipe pressure, flow and engine volumetric efficiency. H. A. Newlyn, De Montfort Univ. With the introduction of variable length induction pipes con- trolled by the engine management system on some race engines, the relationships between the induction performance and the engine parameters needs to be described. An analysis of this dependence has been carried out using a com- puter simulation and the results of previously published works in an attempt to produce simplified relationships that may be of use. The basic engine geometry used was that of the four- valve/ cylinder Weslake WRP275 engine. 942532. (P-288) Design of a land-speed record motorcycle engine. Joseph H. Harralson, Sierra Design Engineering. The 3L, V4 is an engine designed specifically to power a land- speed record motorcycle. Most previous engines used for this pur- pose have been adaptations of production engines. The 3L, V4 has 302</page><page sequence="302">942532-942539 a displacement of three liters which also makes it one of the largest motorcycle engines ever built. This paper describes the engine and some of the analytical methods used in the design. The engine was designed on an extremely small budget. Extensive use was made of computer analysis. All of this work was done using a small personal computer. This paper describes the type of analysis performed and demonstrates the range of analysis possible on a PC. 942533. (P-288) Numerical study of volumetric efficiencies in a high-speed, four valve, four cylinder, spark ignition engine. A. A. Boretti, Centro Ricerche Fiat; and M. Borghi and G. Cantore, Università di Bologna. High power output, four stroke, motorcycle engines are charac- terized by specific power levels well beyond 150 HP/liter also in production engines. These power levels are obtained through extremely high values of volumetric efficiencies in the range of high engine speed, resulting from highly optimized gas exchange pro- cesses. In the present paper, a four cylinder, four- valve-per-cylinder engine with a four-in-one exhaust is optimized for volumetric effi- ciencies by using state-of-the-art computational methods. These computational methods include static three-dimensional computa- tions as well as dynamic one-and three-dimensional computations. The engine geometric and operating parameters optimized by using these computations agree fairly well with those optimized by using experiments, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed computational practice. 942534. (P-288) Numerical correlation of combustion evolu- tion and port and combustion chamber shape in a high-speed, four-valve, spark ignition engine. A. A. Boretti, Centro Ricerche Fiat; and G. Cantore and E. Mattarelli, Università di Bologna. High power output, four-stroke, motorcycle engines are charac- terized by a complex combustion evolution strongly influenced by the properties of the averaged and turbulent flow field. In the present paper, state-of-the-art detailed computational methods are used to investigate the combustion evolution in a four-cylinder, four-valve- per-cylinder engine with a four-in-one exhaust where volumetric efficiencies and mixture compositions have been previously com- puted. Three-dimensional unsteady computations of intake, com- pression, combustion and expansion strokes are performed. The method proves to be effective in qualitatively predicting heat release rate variations with engine speed and volumetric efficiency, while the simple modeling of the turbulent combustion does not allow to precisely define the magnitude of these variations. 942535. (P-287) Off track - Frame and suspension tuning (FAST). Larry A. Bradley and Mark A. Carpenter, Ford Motor Co. Through Frame and Suspension Tuning (FAST) you can identify suspension and frame Set-ups in the lab without risk to the car or driver. For on-track, verification the number of Set-ups can be reduced from an unlimited number to two or three and then opti- mized on the track, rather than developed on the track. This method can be used with all forms of racing. It has been applied to Indy, GT, Winston Cup, and Trans Am cars. Through the use of a road simulator we are able to evaluate and improve the frame and suspension dynamics in a laboratory. This paper will focus on the first step in the tuning process, frame tuning. If the frame is not tuned for the input energy conditions it can become an uncontrolled suspension component. The first step is to identify the frame dynamic characteristics. Operation deform shapes are measured to identify local and global motion. The frames are modified to optimize the response for the type of race track. After the frame dynamics are acceptable for the type of input energy, the suspension components can be tuned for optimal performance. 942536. (P-287) An efficient method for treating race tire force-moment data. Hugo S., Radt, Jr., Milliken Research Asso- ciates, Inc. Experience shows that raw data from tire test machines requires processing to obtain reliable results from complex vehicle models. Lateral force and self-aligning torque data on a P275/40VR-17 Eagle ZR-S tire are processed, plotted and fitted in order to facilitate data smoothing and to provide a simple, accurate representation of the tire for race car simulations. The approach employs non- dimensional variables for lateral force, self-aligning torque and slip angle, so that data points for different loads all fall on the same nor- malized curve. Additional features of the method are described, based on investigations of passenger car tires. An efficient "re- duced" test sequence is presented. 942537. (P-287) Simulation and analysis of suspension and aerodynamic interactions of race cars. R. Scott Floyd and E. Harry Law, Clemson Univ. Track testing of race cars is expensive and racing series typically limit the amount of testing that can be done on circuit tracks. Because of this, we saw the need to develop a computer model that could simulate a car on a track with any specified surface roughness and with aerodynamic loading acting on the vehicle. This model allows an analysis of the effect of aerodynamic loading on the verti- cal dynamic response of the vehicle. Vehicle parameters specific to an IMSA GTP car including aerodynamic data from wind tunnel testing and non- linear shock characteristics were used in this study. Simulations were run for various speeds and ride height configura- tions and it was found that very small changes in the static settings of the front and rear ride heights can lead to large differences in the resulting ride heights at speed. This can be attributed to the varia- tions in the non-linear aerodynamic loading as the ride height and speed of the vehicle change. This model was also used to investigate the "porpoising" phenomenon in which a vehicle experiences large pitching oscillations. An attempt was made to see if the dependence of the aerodynamic down force on the rates of change of the spring mass ride heights could lead to these large oscillations of the vehi- cle. However, results on porpoising were inconclusive mainly due to the lack of data on the aerodynamic "damping" effects. 942538. (P-287) Moment method - A comprehensive tool for race car development. William F. Milliken, Milliken Research Associates, Inc.; Peter G. Wright, Team Lotus , Ltd.; and Douglas L. Milliken, Milliken Research Associates, Inc. The MRA Moment Method computer program automates an original approach to the analysis of race car handling. For a given speed and power/braking conditions, the computer solution covers the full maneuvering envelope and presents the results graphically in one figure. The model is based on a comprehensive non-linear vehicle representation utilizing tire, chassis, and aerodynamic input data as available to race car designers and developers. The paper will first explain and illustrate the Moment Method in general terms, with some graphical examples. The ability of the technique to model the behavior of a F. 1 car traversing a small bump in mid-corner on a Grand Prix circuit is then reviewed. The results correlate well with the driver comments rela- tive to changes in directional stability (plow/spin) as the car pitches over the bump. It also correlates well with the lateral acceleration/ speed that the driver is willing to use in this corner. 942539. (P-288) Gasoline for NASCAR stock car racing: 1951 - 1994. Tim Wusz, Unocal Corp. The need for special gasolines for racing has grown over the pst 40+ years as engine technology has evolved and engine efficiency has improved. What started out as supplying service station gasoline to early stock car racing competitors in the National Association for Stock Car Automobile Racing, Inc. (NASCAR) has grown into sup- plying a specialized racing gasoline for the very sophisticated racing engines used in stock car racing as we know it today. In 1951 the Pure Oil Company, which merged with the Union Oil Company of California (now Unocal) in 1965, began supplying gasoline for stock car racing sanctioned by NASCAR in the south- 303</page><page sequence="303">942539-942546 eastern United States. Today, Unocal continues to provide gasoline to NASCAR, but it is a significantly different product than in the 1950's. In the early years, compression ratios and horsepower output were relatively low (average of 7:1 and 101 for the 1951 model year) and octane demand was satisfied by service station gasoline. As horsepower and compression ratios increased, a demand for special blends of gasoline tailored for racing became apparent. That need was met by changing the Reid Vapor Pressure to reduce the ten- dency for fuel pump vapor lock. As stock car racing grew, so did the need for special blends of gasoline with increased octane quality. When engine displacement increased in the 1960's, an additional demand for high octane qual- ity was created. That need was also met with additional octane qual- ity to satisfy large cylinder bores, high engine output, hemispherical combustion chambers, and higher compression ratios, as racing speeds increased and new super speedways were built where 200 mph was exceeded on a closed course. The computer age of the 1980' s brought about advanced tech- niques for commercial gasoline blending. These new techniques were used to update racing gasoline blending and to optimize the use of high octane quality blending stocks to stay ahead of improved racing engine technology. During this era, Unocal engineers developed a procedure to eval- uate the effectiveness of high octane quality gasoline in real-world racing engines on engine dynamometers. The procedure was based on the Modified Uniontown Technique originally developed to determine Road Octane Numbers (RdON). RdON is the anti-knock performance of the fuel when subjected to the real conditions found in multi-cylinder engines in automobiles. This test work was done using a racing engine on a high-speed engine dynamometer to elimi- nate the variables found in vehicle testing on a chassis dynamome- ter. The 1990' s have brought more sophistication to racing and the need to provide consistently high performance gasoline as racing evolves. The fuel and lubricant products provided for racing have continued to satisfy the demands of the engine builders for the past 40+ years. The paper will provide the technical methods used to develop racing gasolines beginning in the 1950's up to the present. Variables evaluated throughout the years include refinery blending stocks, anti-knock additives and their concentrations, and surface ignition control additives. Since the 1960's, state- of-the-art racing engines have been the test tools used in these evaluations. Data presented in the paper will include the test methods as well as the results of the testing. 942540. (P-288) Fuels development for Formula One. S. G. Bryce and R. Lindsay, Shell International Petroleum Co., Ltd.; I. Galliard, Shell Research, Ltd.; and A. R. Glover, Showa Shell. The development of fuels for Formula One engines is described by reference to the 1988 - 1992 Grand Prix seasons. Fuel develop- ment for both turbocharged and normally aspirated engines is detailed, and a robust methodology is presented which enables sus- tainable fuel performance improvements by optimized matching to the engine combustion system. The relevance of Formula One fuel research to commercial gaso- lines is described. It is shown that there are many areas of research where there are benefits arising that are directly transferable to the motoring public. 942541. (P-288) Unleaded racing gasoline components and blends in the 110 octane range. Roger Leveque, HSL Research Services; and Mitch Marcusich and Gregg Patriquin, Pro Racing Fuels. Octane data is presented for a range of high octane fuel compo- nents and potential blending formulations for unleaded racing fuels with research octanes in the 1 10 range intended as suitable commer- cial replacements for leaded racing fuels. Data is reported on the anti-knock response for organometallic additives containing manganese and iron, in this octane range. Octanes were determined for families of selected compounds including ethers, esters, amines, alcohols, hydrocarbons and miscel- laneous chemicals formulated with a base blend of toluene and refinery alkylate hydrocarbons. Dynamometer test data is also pres- ented. The results indicate that the blends producing the highest octanes contained either oxygen or nitrogen bearing compounds and were capable of producing octanes in the 110 range. However, for a potential unleaded fuel, only a limited number of materials were able to meet the key criteria of safety, trouble-free operations and a fuel switch requiring only minor engine adjustments or none at all. The oxygenate methyl tertiary buthyl ether (MTBE) and a manga- nese additive methyl cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) ranked high as preferred blending agents for an unleaded racing fuel. 942542. (P-288) The Sasol oil racing fuels and lubricants research facility. G. E. Jones and I. S. Myburgh, Sasol Oil Research and Development ; and J. J. Botha, Sasol Oil. Motor racing in general and Formula 1 in particular, represents the leading edge in automotive technology. Participation in Formula 1 presents a challenge and an opportunity to the petroleum industry where significant research benefits can be gained in terms of product development. As a direct result of the regulations governing the composition of the fuels that may be used in motor racing, especially in Formula 1, they have much in common with their commercial counterparts. Racing fuels and lubricants are, however, optimized for the specific demands of motor racing. The technology gained through this research has had a significant bearing on the procedures and equip- ment employed in commercial fuel and lubricant's development. Because of the very high specific output of a modern racing engine, the fuel evaluation procedure is vastly different from that used on commercial engines. The ability to have an engine test sys- tem which can provide repeatable and accurate performance and combustion results within the framework of a system which cannot be allowed to stabilize fully, due to the very high thermal stress levels at full power, is all important. With the aid of its racing ftiel development facility and the sup- porting simulation programs, Sasol is making good use of its syn- thetic coal derived products to develop racing fuels that give a com- petitive advantage. This knowledge is also applied in the formula- tion and production of commercial fuels with economic and techno- logical benefits. 942543. (P-288) Combustion efficiency and sound attenuation as affected by muffler design. Ray T. Flügger and Jim McFarland, Flowmaster, Inc. This paper identifies some of the environmental issues associated with sound attenuation of exhaust notes generated by internal com- bustion racing engines. It points to how sound abatement relates to overall engine combustion efficiency or power. Historically, there has not been widespread concern about envi- ronmental impact of unabated exhaust noise produced in various forms of motorsports. Today, this is changing. In the interest of maintaining acceptable levels of power from muffled racing engines, a technology is emerging that focuses on the relationships between combustion efficiency and exhaust noise reduction. Through the combined use of engine cycle analysis (ECA) and spectrum analysis, this paper discusses how these two areas of data acquisition and their application are leading to a reduction in the potential damage to human hearing, not to the significant detriment of race car performance. 942546. (P-288) Single-point, hot refueling of racing cars. Jean-Marc A. Tonneau, Inter Technique. A new rapid fueling system has been developed for Formula One racing cars. 304</page><page sequence="304">942546-942552 Handling of highly volatile fuel in a very stressful environment makes safety of paramount importance. To lessen the risk of accident, simplicity in operation and reduced number of operators led to the design of a single point sys- tem. This system incorporates car tank venting, fuel delivery and vapor recovery in a single, quick, connect/disconnect, coupling assembly. The existing car fuel replenishment configuration and the time restraint of a pit-stop dictates pressure refueling. 942547. (P-287) Anthropometry of Indy Car drivers. Dennis V. Andrzejak, Kenneth J. Baron , and Jeff Roegner, General Motors Corp. This study assembled a database of anatomic dimensions of Indy Car drivers and developed procedures that can be used as models of future compilations of anatomic data from specialized popula- tions. The database defines the body configuration for the Indy Car driver population and indicates that the current HYBRID III, mid- size, male, crash dummy will provide a reasonable approximation of that population if used in investigations involving issues of crash protection. This study took advantage of a unique opportunity to assemble an anthropometric database from a specialized population which was compared to an existing database collected from a comparable sub-set of the United States population. 942548. (P-287) Analysis of a dirt track sprint car accident. L. Daniel Metz , University of Illinois; and Kevin H. Forbes, India- napolis Motor Speedway Corp. Open-wheel dirt-track racing represents one of the most danger- ous forms of motor racing. The potential for touching and/or inter- locking of rotating wheels, combined with the frangible and rutted nature of the track surface itself, makes the occurrence of x-axis rol- lovers routine. In addition, the rollovers themselves are usually at a high enough speed so that very violent dynamics and occupant accelerations occur. The accelerative vectors present an unusually set of challenges to the restraint systems employed. In this work, we examine a single dirt-track rollover event. The purposes of the investigation were (a) to attempt to characterize the dynamics of the vehicle motion through videographic analysis, (b) to estimate the accelerative loadings to which the driver would be exposed, (c) to develop a first order analysis model for car and sus- pension motions which ensue following interlocking of counter- rotating wheels, and (d) to determine whether current restraint tech- nology is acceptably strong enough to face such accidents. To begin, a short introductory section characterizing dirt- track midget car racing in general is presented. Dirt-track racing presents a very high potential for rollover accidents whenever a sprint car is presented sideways to its direction of travel. A short description of the accident event is presented next, fol- lowed by a discussion of the mechanism of tripped and untripped rollover, a frame-by-frame videotape analysis was used to examine the rollover motion. Combining driver position information with the video analysis enabled estimates to be made of the accelerations experienced by the driver. Standard anthropometric correlations were used to estimate body segment masses from driver weight. Estimating accelerative restraint loadings through the use of video- graphic analysis and anthropometry was necessary because of the impossibility of duplicating realistic motion in the laboratory. To examine vehicle motion further, a first-order analysis of vehi- cle dynamics involving interlocking, counterrotating exposed wheels was performed. Simple calculations show that such engage- ments develop significant whole-vehicle and component forces and kinetic energies. Belt and buckle strengths were measured under quasistatic condi- tions. A total of five arm restraints and five arm restraint hardware sets were tested. Strengths for the larger belts used in the restraint system (lap, torso and antisubmarine) were extrapolated from arm restraint data. Finally, belt and hardware rupture loads were com- pared to expected inertia loads to determine the potential for belt failure. Results showed that there is potential for such failures to occur, and failures did in fact occur during the actual accident. A discussion of the restrictions, assumptions and test conditions fol- lows the above analysis. 942549. High performance braking - The design and appli- cation of liquid-cooled brake calipers. H. Smales, Consultant. In most forms of motor racing, be it circuit racing or rallying, there have always been particularly arduous venues causing exces- sive brake temperatures. On any vehicle the brakes are a safety criti- cal item, and clearly losing part or even all braking power at racing speeds is potentially fatal. Traditionally, rally applications have proved challenging to brake designers because of the extremes of temperature experienced. Such cars generate high stop energies partly because of the relatively high weight of the cars (and high center of gravity, resulting in considerable weight transfer during a stop) and the use of modern high performance carbon metallic pads. Add to this, marginal cooling and the extremes of abuse provided by left foot braking techniques, and it becomes easy to see why maintaining consistent stopping power throughout a stage can some- times be a problem. 942550. The rapid prototyping of application specific signal processor (RASSP) program: Overview and accomplishments. Mark A. Richards, Advanced Research Projects Agency, U.S. Department of Defense. Motivated by the need to field affordable, state-of-the-art embed- ded signal processors for a wide range of DoD systems, the Rapid Prototyping of Application Specific Signal Processors (RASSP) program is an ARPA/Tri-Service initiative intended to dramatically improve the process by which embedded digital signal processors are designed, manufactured, and supported. This paper introduces the program from two viewpoints. The first is technical, covering the major concepts upon which the RASSP approach to design is based.

Time domain design/analysis tool for the MIL-STD 1553B data bus. Paul F. Christiano and Brent E. Moats, McDon- nell Douglas Aerospace. This paper describes the capabilities of using a time domain anal- ysis to simulate the electrical waveforms on the MIL-STD- 1553B data bus using the circuit simulation program SPICE. This simula- tion was developed to analyze the various data bus architectures of the space station freedom (SSF) propulsion module system. The advantages of this model over frequency domain model is that the waveform is directly calculated, not synthesized, providing a more accurate and detailed waveform representation. Also, nonstandard configurations and effects can be modeled with accurate simulation results. The output of the simulation is an electrical waveform which can be measured at any point in the bus architecture. Therefore, it is possible to see the distortion effects of the transmitted signal's waveform at any point on the MIL-STD- 1553B data bus. This model accurately simulates the stray impedance effects of all bus components, and is flexible enough to examine any transmitted waveform. 942552. Today's military semiconductor manufacturers embracing dual-use technology. Thomas E. Wett, Intel Corp. Secretary Perry's directive along with the continued focus of the ARPA program is bringing the dual-use technology concept ever closer to the defense and military semiconductor manufacturer. This push for dual-use technologies is changing the design philosophy of the defense contractor while causing the military semiconductor manufacturer to change its way of business. Both sides of the party will benefit from the dual-use concept. The military semiconductor manufacturer will be able to provide a larger variety of products introduced to the military market quicker by utilizing a more com- 305</page><page sequence="305">942552-942554 mercial-like flow for its processes. This variety of products can be offered to various price points to provide many options for perfor- mance-based specifications. The defense contractor will reap the rewards of products introduced quicker to the market by remaining on the leading-edge of technology. The various product grades offered by the military semiconductor manufacturer will allow more flexible product positioning for the defense contractor in the defense and commercial sectors. 942553. Insert and fly - Using PCMCIA PC cards in the avi- onics market Stuart Levy, Intel Corp. When looking into using PCMCIA PC cards in the avionics mar- ket, three areas must be researched. The first is what are the applica- tions and benefits of using the PC cards while in flight, followed by the applications and benefits on the ground, and thirdly on how to make a PC card that would stand up to the rugged avionics environ- ment. PCMCIA PC cards can be used in all aspects of flight. Three pos- sible applications on the ground are; paperless documentation, mod- ifications, flightline changes. Once airborne, PC cards can be removed and a different functionality card can be inserted. One PC card socket can be used for many different functions during one flight. Some of the possible applications for PC cards inflight are; flight plan changes, backup line replaceable units (LRUs), and solid state data collection. Since avionics products are either used in the air, in an open air hanger or on the flightline, PC cards that are more rugged than those currently available will need to be developed. They will have to be developed from day one, with avionics in mind. 942554. A millimeter wave, wireless, LAN for use inside an aircraft. Erwin A. Ulbrich, Jr., McDonnell Douglas Transport Air- craft. A millimeter wave, wireless, local area network has been built for use in distributing digital data inside an aircraft. To avoid inter- ference with existing VHF and microwave transmitters and receiv- ers, the transmitters operate at 60.60 Ghz and 60.54 Ghz. This region of the millimeter wave spectrum has high attenuation being the resonant frequency of local oxygen atoms. This isolates the wire- less links from most interference. The transceivers employ V-Band Gunn Diode Voltage-Controlled Oscillators. The maximum range is 150 meters. The network boards have been optimized for Mil- Spec- 1553 type digital messages. A wide variety of other digital for- mats can be supported from 200 Khz up to video rates, but analog video sent through the system was too noisy for conventional televi- sion receivers. This paper describes the rationale, the system requirements, the development, the final design, and the test results. 306</page></plain_text>
