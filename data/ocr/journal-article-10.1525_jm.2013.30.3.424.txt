<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Debussy’s Toy Stories SIMON MORRISON When and where was Claude Debussy’s The Toy Box premiered? Completed in piano score in 1913, the ballet went on tour under the original French title La Boıˆte a` joujoux, the Russian Yashchik s igrushkami, and the Swedish Leksaksla ̊dan. The preferred Amer- ican title, The Toy Box, was changed by the English to The Toy Shop. In any language, Debussy wanted the ballet to entertain children, and even imagined children performing it. Puppets too. But once the orchestra- tion was finished and adults got involved, things became complicated. The first successful, large-scale production is credited to Rolf de 424 Mare ́’s Ballets Sue ́dois, the rival company to Sergey Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in Paris during the first half of the 1920s. The Ballets Sue ́dois creative team—choreographer and principal dancer Jean Bo ̈rlin, designer Fernand Le ́ger, scriptwriter Jean Cocteau, and the composers of Les Six— dismantled the old Gesamtkunstwerk ideal, preferring theatrical antithe- ses to syntheses. In de Mare ́’s most experimental undertakings, music, dance, and de ́cor conflicted rather than coalesced.1 The Ballets Sue ́dois drew inspiration from Swedish folklore, African-American ‘‘jazz,’’ silent film, skating rinks, the behavior of asylum inmates, malfunctioning cam- eras at wedding celebrations. And toys. Debussy’s ballet was staged by the Special thanks to the staffs of the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art in Moscow and the Dance Museum in Stockholm, to Pilar Castro Kiltz, and to the American Council of Learned Societies.

Balletomanes (like Cyril Beaumont), collaborator memoirists (Boris Kochno), and sketch artists (Valentine Hugo) who preserved the work of Diaghilev’s company did not perform the same service for de Mare ́’s.3 Perhaps for this reason, the curious story of The Toy Box from illustrated scenario to piano score to orchestral score(s) to ballet remains obscure. Extant photographs, a set model, choreographic notes in French and Swedish, reviews, and period mem- orabilia offer an approximate sense of how it was staged in 1921. The music survives, albeit without the original orchestration, as do the cos- tumes and de ́cor; the dance and pantomime do not—except in photo albums, the adult equivalent of storybooks. Yet even after these materials have been assembled from archives across France, Sweden, Russia, and the United States, The Toy Box resists reconstruction. The question of when and where it reached the stage can now be answered, but what reached the stage largely escapes us. The best sense of the work emerges from a chronicle of its earliest performances, including those previously unknown in New York City, San Francisco, 425 and, most notably, Moscow. Similarities among these distinct and dis- parate stagings shed light on the basic ideas behind The Toy Box and its unique way of making art for children. The most significant point in common, and the one each performance struggled to realize, is the insistence that the actors and dancers ‘‘must awaken a dream in the imagination of children.’’4 Not an easy task, as we will see, but also not one for a heavy heart. 2 The Ballets Sue ́dois performed La Boıˆte a` joujoux at the The ́aˆtre des Champs-E ́lyse ́es and on tour throughout Europe and the United States fifty-one times in its first season (1920–1921), fifty-two times in its second, one hundred thirty-nine times in its third, thirty- four times in its fourth, and four times in its fifth.

It recalled a ‘‘nervous hug.’’5 Debussy composed the ballet for his precocious eight-year-old daughter Claude-Emma, known as ‘‘Chouchou’’ (Darling). He doted on her, spoiling her with exclusive, exquisite playthings, including a Noah’s Ark wooden animal set designed by the children’s artist Andre ́ Helle ́ (1871–1945), a long-time friend. The miniature menagerie fea- tures simple geometrical lines and solid colors. Helle ́ maintained the same studiously naı ̈ve look and feel in his Alphabet de la Grande Guerre, 1914–1916 (Alphabet of the Great War, 1914–1916); his designs for the Florent Schmitt ballet Une Semaine du petit elfe Ferme-l’Oeil (A Week in the Life of Shut-Eye the Little Elf; 1924); the furniture he conceived for 426 nurseries and kindergartens; and his Noah’s Ark letterhead, which both Chouchou and Debussy’s wife favored.6 Helle ́ conceived the scenario of La Boıˆte a` joujoux for Debussy and Chouchou in 1913. The idea for the project had come to him a year before, during work on the undersized de ́cor for ‘‘a satire of music-hall revues’’ called simply 1912.7 The obvious sequel to this project, he explained in an interview, was a ‘‘ballet for puppets.’’8 The puppets became toys that escaped their container after dark to live out their lives—blockheaded ones, to be sure, but lives nonetheless as citizens of - other reviews of the Ballets Sue ́dois are preserved at the Dance Museum (Dansmuseet) in Stockholm along with catalogued and uncatalogued bundles of Ballets Sue ́dois documents, costume and set designs, and memorabilia.

Other smaller holdings exist in England and the United States. Yale University, for example, houses the archive of the composer Cole Porter, which includes the piano score of a one-act sketch for dance calledWithin the Quota that depicts a Swede’s starry-eyed immigra- tion to the United States.

After all, Helle ́ suggested in his preface to the sce- nario of La Boıˆte a` joujoux, toy boxes are ‘‘really just like towns in which toys live like people—or maybe towns are really just toy boxes in which people live like toys.’’9 He illustrated the scenario in watercolor, the winsome images matched to musical themes sketched by Debussy. Helle ́ refined the sce- nario after Debussy’s death, expanding his descriptions of the inter- actions between the characters in the 1926 edition, and offering an editorial comment on the divide of innocence versus experience. He preferred childhood,10 but did not try to shield children from the darker knowledge that adulthood brings. To be outside the toy box, he recog- nized, is to come to know ‘‘fear,’’ to be the plaything of ‘‘crueler masters than children: emotion, thought, and fate.’’11 After a prologue titled ‘‘Le Sommeil de la boıˆte’’ (The Toy Box Asleep), the characters come into conflict. Some are drawn from the old commedia dell’arte tradition, which showcased stock actors in stock si- tuations acting out improvised plots based on suggestions from the audi- ence. Helle ́ returned this form of metatheater to its origins in children’s games of make-believe. La Boıˆte a` joujoux has a triangular Doll as its heroine, a rectangular Soldier as its hero, and a misshapen Polichinelle 427 as villain. The Soldier’s intentions toward the Doll are nice, Polichi- nelle’s naughty. Other characters from French and English children’s books are featured, along with a wooden elephant and tiger, ducks (later replaced by geese in the designs), and sheep. To amuse the musicolo- gists, Debussy included a footnote in the score beneath a tune assigned to the pachyderm: ‘‘An old Hindu chant still used in the taming of elephants. It is constructed on the mode of ‘5-in-the-morning’ and is obligatorily in 54.’’ 12 The ‘‘Pas de l’E ́le ́phant’’ is not based on actual Indian music; obviously, and as Roy Howat has noted, ragas do not come in 54. The mode of ‘‘5-in-the-morning’’ might refer to the time of the day that Debussy met with the Hindustani musician Inayat Khan for lessons on the zither: 5 in the afternoon.13 9 Andre ́ Helle ́ and Claude Debussy, La Boıˆte a` Joujoux: Ballet pour enfants (Paris: Durand, 1913). 10 Hence the title of his memoirs, written three years before his death: Les Souvenirs d’un petit garc ̧on (Memoirs of a Little Boy; 1942). 11 Herlin, ‘‘Andre ́ Helle ́ et La Boıˆte a` joujoux,’’ 119–20. 12 The footnote appears in the autograph and published piano scores but not in Debussy’s and Andre ́ Caplet’s orchestral score. 13 Roy Howat, ‘‘Debussy and the Orient,’’ in Recovering the Orient: Artists, Scholars, Appropriations, ed.

(Phonographs are often featured in Ballets Sue ́dois productions, where they have the surrealistic effect of turning the pro- ductions into recordings of themselves.) Helle ́ imagined the stage and backcloths becoming a battlefield, a sheepfold, and a gingerbread house beneath ice cream clouds.14 In the second tableau, clones of the Soldier wage battle with those of the Polichinelle. Oversized, vitamin-rich peas replace cannon balls in the arsenal; the carnage depicts a toddler’s din- nertime. (The toy war was not conceived by Helle ́ to educate children about the Great War of 1914–1918, though critics have made this con- nection, forgetting that his scenario dates from 1913. La Boıˆte a` joujoux differs in this crucial respect from Helle ́’s Alphabet de la Grande Guerre, which he explicitly dedicated to French children and soldiers.)15 The Soldier is wounded in the food fight, and the Doll tends to his convales- cence, their blossoming love symbolized by an itinerant rose—perhaps a reference to Maeterlinck’s 1893 play Pelle ́as et Me ́lisande, wherein a rose symbolizes innocent love. Debussy decided to represent the flower, also a traditional symbol of rebirth, not with a musical theme but with the 428 unsignifiable signified of a fermata over a rest. The fourth tableau, which takes place far in the future ‘‘apre`s fortune faite’’ (after fortune came), finds Polichinelle transformed into an eavesdropping village constable; the Soldier sports a large white beard, and the Doll has grown consider- ably plumper. Unable to dance, she tries singing instead, but this is after all a ballet, so she fails. The suburbanites are now the parents of a girl and boy; they lean into a polka and then into each other before the de ́cor of the prologue returns. The plot of La Boıˆte a` joujoux invokes Petrushka in places, including the magical animation at the opening: Debussy and Helle ́’s conjuring phono- graph recalls Stravinsky and Benois’s fairground magician. But unlike Petrushka, La Boıˆte a` joujoux leaves its three principal characters to their - ending droughts, and lighting candles with his singing. See www.suraurtaal.com/forums/ one-of-the-greatest-indian-vocalist-mian-tansen-vt393.html, accessed 14 July 2012. 14 Helle ́ included seven pages of meticulous instructions for producing the ballet in the 1913 Durand edition of his scenario (Bibliothe`que-Muse ́e de l’Ope ́ra [Paris], Dossier d’oeuvre, La Boıˆte a` joujoux). 15 Glenn Watkins speculated that the ballet pantomime was conceived ‘‘when general assumptions of inevitable conflict prevailed,’’ and that, ‘‘for all the toy-box origins of the work, in the context of the time the work must surely have seemed less a reflection of Debussy’s interest in the world of children per se than in the subtle parallels between the child, the puppet, and the adult, and their shared helplessness to act in an increasingly menacing world.’’ Watkins, Proof Through the Night: Music and the Great War (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2003), 111, 114. Watkins backdated the French premiere of the ballet pantomime from December 1919 to December 1918; the error lends support to his argument. </page> <page sequence="6"> morrison own devices. There is no interaction between their world and ours, and no aspiration to such—save, perhaps, for the stage cue at the end of the first tableau, which describes the cardboard-cutout face of a constable appear- ing in the window of the toyshop, shooing the toys back into their box. To breach the divide between the real and the imagined would be to believe in the existence of that divide, which children do not. Petrushka also comes up in studies of the music. Robert Orledge isolated possible references in La Boıˆte a` joujoux to Stravinsky’s neonatio- nalistic score, especially a passage at rehearsal 1, measures 21–24, where the ‘‘diatonic theme and sliding chromatic harmonies’’ echo the entrance of the ballerina in scene two of Stravinsky’s ballet.16 Moreover, Polichinelle is represented by a theme built of alternating seconds; a comparison might be made to the alternating seconds that point to the ghost of Petrushka, but Debussy sticks to major seconds, whereas Stravinsky alternates major and minor. The two scores share the octa- tonic scale, although Stravinsky relies on it more heavily than Debussy. There are also some common instrumental choices, like the snare drum rolls that mark the transition between scenes. These references to Petrushka mingle with gestures toward other works by Stravinsky, especially L’Oiseau de feu and Le Sacre du printemps. 429 The flute solo in Debussy’s Prelude, for example, splits the pitch-content difference between the horn solo that closes L’Oiseau and the bassoon solo opening Le Sacre. But Debussy proves too subtle a composer for musicological games of gotcha. He resisted directly quoting Stravinsky’s ostinato patterns and chromatic harmonies, and instead alludes to much more elusive things: the texture of Stravinsky’s scoring in certain pas- sages; the instrumental combinations he prefers; the registers within which real and invented snippets of folksong might fall. Arguably what relates the two scores most closely is their emphasis on virtuosic piano solos: Debussy, like Stravinsky, enacts the revenge of the dutiful rehearsal pianist on those dancers he or she has been hired to serve day after grinding day. Perhaps in referring to Stravinsky, Debussy suggests that French pup- pets are different from Russian puppets; they are kinder, gentler, the Doll and the Soldier preferring wine to vodka. Doubtless he wanted the refer- ences to be themselves like toys. The music ‘‘speaks’’ less to the musically literate listener, self-satisfied with catching this or that quote, than to the passionate, open-minded egocentrism of a toddler. Sudden switches between melodies, particularly in the first tableau, recall a child’s orneri- ness—the impatient desire to have it all. First one theme, then another, 16 Robert Orledge, ‘‘Another Look inside Debussy’s ‘Toybox,’’’Musical Times 117, no. 1606 (December 1976): 987–89, esp. 989. </page> <page sequence="7"> the journal of musicology and then another is rejected with a dissonant outburst, the musical equiv- alent of a two-year-old’s impetuous ‘‘Non, Non, Non!’’ The references are not send-ups or satires, however, but diminutive distillations. Within La Boıˆte a` joujoux, satire is frowned upon. In the fourth tableau, the marionette children’s performance of the polka displeases their parents precisely because it is comical, an impish lampoon of a proper polka. The polka begins, according to information provided to Roger Nichols by his wife Sarah, by quoting the rhythm of the second verse in the little counting rhyme ‘‘One, two, three, four, five / Once I caught a fish alive.’’ Chouchou likely learned it from her English governess.17 The first tableau also finds an English wooden soldier in black face performing a cakewalk. The music is feeble and foursquare, recalling ‘‘Golliwogg’s Cakewalk’’ from Debussy’s 1908 Children’s Corner; actually, its first fourteen measures are borrowed (and transposed) from a 1909 Debussy piano piece called Le petit ne`gre.18 In mocking a loose-limbed African-American dance, the stiff, unmusical soldier in La Boıˆte a` joujoux ends up mocking himself. Racist representation becomes, in miniature, a representation of racism. None of these borrowings is exact in form or function; instead, they 430 are scaled to suit a little girl’s hands, like the delicate furniture in a doll- house. Debussy preserved just the general shape of his sources, their outlines rather than their specific harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic con- tent. His references are the musical equivalent of the simple, graphic playthings that Helle ́ designed. His objects exclude particulars, because he believed that too much representation would dull rather than stimu- late a child’s imagination. Thus his Noah’s Ark set provides the basic shapes and poses of the biblical animals but omits the details of their faces, tails, and hides. Helle ́’s abstractions open up a special space between the real and its representation to be filled by a child’s own desire. To borrow the language of Didier Maleuvre, a scholar who has thought long and hard about such matters, each of the musical borrowings cum toys is an object taken ‘‘from the hic et nunc [here and now] of empirical experience—an object removed into the distance of its own image.’’19 17 Roger Nichols, liner notes, Achille-Claude Debussy (1862–1918): Complete Works for Piano, vol. 5, Jean-Efflam Bavouzet (piano), Chandos 10545, 2009, compact disc. 18 See Robert Orledge, Debussy and the Theatre (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), 182. The quotation, Orledge comments, is ‘‘the only direct piece of self- borrowing that I know of in Debussy.’’ 19 Didier Maleuvre,Museum Memories: History, Technology, Art (Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, 1999), 137. The go-to critical source on toys remains Charles Baudelaire’s ‘‘A Philosophy of Toys,’’ to which Maleuvre refers. It is a sad little piece, proposing that toys are the child’s first exposure to art, to the powers of enchantment. Disenchantment, or melancholia, occurs when the child, succumbing to morbid desire, tears the toy apart seeking to perceive its ‘‘soul’’ but finds nothing inside. Baudelaire, ‘‘A Philosophy of Toys,’’ in Charles Baudelaire, The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays, ed. and trans. Jonathan </page> <page sequence="8"> morrison This remove characterizes Helle ́’s designs for La Boıˆte a` joujoux as well as Debussy’s score. The allusions to Stravinsky become distant sonic images, telescoped simulacra that multiply in reference not only to Stra- vinsky’s music but also to his own borrowings. Copies spawn copies, further blurring the original. In Petrushka, Stravinsky features stylized French and Russian popular ditties in the opening and closing fair- ground scenes, among them a paraphrase of E ́mile Spencer’s French polka ‘‘La jambe du bois’’ and a generous selection of Russian folk- songs.20 In response, Debussy paraphrases the 1780 chanson ‘‘Il pleut, il pleut, berge`re’’ in the third tableau of La Boıˆte a` joujoux and, in the epilogue, the 1819 chanson ‘‘En avant, Fanfan la Tulipe.’’21 Polichinelle dances, fittingly, to an adaptation of the traditional sing-along ‘‘Pan! Qu’est-ce qu’est la`?’’ (Hark! Who’s there? It’s Polichinelle, Madame), which recalls ‘‘Pop! Goes the Weasel.’’ One or the other is blared by the brass at the start of the fourth tableau. There are other musical toys in the box, some of cruder design. (One clever detail of La Boıˆte a` joujoux in general: the borrowings asso- ciated with Polichinelle are garish and obtuse, like the villain himself; those associated with the Doll and Soldier more nuanced, subtle.) When the Soldier declares himself to the Doll in the third tableau, Debussy 431 quotes the reunion music from the third scene of Maurice Ravel’s Daph- nis et Chloe ́, a Ballets Russes commission from 1909, premiered in 1912. The toy lovers smooch to tolling bells that echo Felix Mendelssohn’s famous ‘‘Wedding March.’’ The battle quotes the ‘‘Soldiers’ Chorus’’ from act 4 of Charles Gounod’s Faust; the march into the strife is har- monized by E  7 and F   (E) major in dissonant conjunction—blatantly and obviously the chords of the ‘‘Dance of the Young Girls’’ from Le Sacre du printemps. The music for the Soldier’s wounded delirium alludes to the opening of the third act of Richard Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde. As the musicologist Jose ́ Eduardo Martins has demonstrated, there are also a plethora of allusions to Modest Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition, a favorite of Chouchou’s.22 This makes perfect sense. If each - Mayne (London: Phaidon, 1964), 198–204. Unlike Baudelaire, Helle ́ seems to have believed, judging from his art, that the child imbues the toy with the soul it otherwise lacks. Disenchantment is an adult’s problem. 20 For the list, see Richard Taruskin, Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: A Biography of the Works Through Mavra, 2 vols. (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1996), 2:695–96. ‘‘The remarkable thing about Petrushka,’’ Taruskin argues, ‘‘. . . is that despite the massive infusion of natural artifacts in the form of folk and street music, the impression the ballet makes is anything but naturalistic’’ (735). This is even truer of The Toy Box. 21 The former was composed by Louis-Victor Simon (1764–1820), the latter by Paul E ́mile Debraux (1796–1831). 22 Jose ́ Eduardo Martins, ‘‘La Vision de l’univers enfantin chez Moussorgsky et Debussy,’’ Cahiers Debussy 9 (1985): 3–16. </page> <page sequence="9"> the journal of musicology set in La Boıˆte a` joujoux pops up like a page in a storybook, what better to quote than a musical tour through a picture gallery? Debussy cites several passages from Mussorgsky’s masterpiece, although he sidesteps the most familiar, the promenade. Ultimately the music of La Boıˆte a` joujoux comes off as an exhibit displaying precious musical artifacts culled from the French, German, and Russian repertoires—each hung low enough for a child to see. Yet the assemblage was meant to sound spontaneous and uncalculated, the borrowings rhymed without reason with the thing itself replaced by a smaller, simpler image of it. There is no substance beneath the sound- ing surface. The music consists of hollow outlines, as flat as Helle ́’s watercolor drawings, intended to be appreciated for their own allure (not their associations). Mundane labeling exercises, the vocation of unimaginative and unsophisticated theorists, are instructive in highlight- ing the artfulness of Debussy’s artifice, but they cannot locate a there that is not there. The plot of The Toy Box is not real, not the site of true ‘‘emotion, thought, and fate.’’ And Debussy’s score, chockablock with borrowings, embraces the pretend—the true essence of toyland, and of art itself. 432 Paris, 1913–1914 and 1919 Debussy finished the piano score on 30 October 1913.23 That same day, he sent a note to his publisher, Jacques Durand, advising that ‘‘only marionettes will be able to convey the meaning of the text and the expression of the music.’’24 Debussy also admitted that he had found it difficult to express the ‘‘soul of the doll’’ in the third tableau, referring obliquely to Maurice Maeterlinck’s contention that marionettes, in their soullessness, can best portray archetypal characters.25 In the following months, Debussy and Helle ́ talked further about the potential staging; they concluded that children, rather than marionettes, were the ideal performers, and that most of the action should be pantomimed. ‘‘Move- ments rather than traditional ballet steps are involved,’’ the composer ex- plained to Durand, ‘‘so there is no need for a ballet master.’’26 23 Information in this paragraph and next is taken from Orledge, Debussy and the Theatre, 178–79, 327. 24 Ibid, 178. 25 Ibid. Maeterlinck defined his concept of a nonhuman theater, and his preference for museum wax figures over marionettes, in an 1890 essay published in Le Jeune Belgique; see Robert Brachear, ‘‘Maurice Maeterlinck and His ‘Muse ́e Gre ́vin,’’’ French Review 40, no. 3 (December 1966): 347–51. In 1894, Maeterlinck published Trois petits drames pour marionettes. 26 Quoted in Orledge, Debussy and the Theatre, 179. </page> <page sequence="10"> morrison The piano score was published toward the end of 1913, and Debussy began its orchestration the following April. He completed the prologue and fifty-five measures of the first tableau before undertaking a conduct- ing tour. World War I complicated efforts to secure the premiere, and Debussy did not return to the orchestration, his energies being drained by a protracted battle with cancer. After his death in March 1918, his long-time assistant, Andre ́ Caplet (1878–1925), took it upon himself to finish the orchestration based on his thorough knowledge of Debussy’s methods.27 The texture after measure 55 of the first tableau—where Debussy left off and Caplet began—does not differ in character from what the composer had set down, though the gentle paternal embrace of the prologue becomes rather muscular in the group dances that follow.28 In November 1919, Caplet submitted the complete orchestral score to the theater director Pierre-Barthe ́lemy Gheusi (1865–1943), who had wanted to stage La Boıˆte a` joujoux from the start, but whose conception was at once too grand and, in Debussy’s opinion, too ‘‘pretty-pretty.’’29 Once Gheusi had cut his plans down to size, Helle ́, Caplet, and Durand gave him the green light at the The ́aˆtre Lyrique du Vaudeville on 10 December 1919. Gheusi mounted the performance in collaboration with the choreographer Robert Quinault (1887–1973), who worked at the 433 time in venues as diverse as the Ope ́ra-Comique and the Folies-Berge`re and later on Broadway with the Ziegfeld Follies. He invented the panto- mime and took the part of Polichinelle. The long-time ballet mistress in the theater, Madame Mariquita (1838–1920),30 supplied the dancers for the other parts. Against Debussy’s original wishes, the performance involved traditional ballet steps. Reviews of the The ́aˆtre Lyrique production were mixed, as was the reaction of the older patrons who filled most of the seats. Gaston Carraud, a music critic and composer who had studied with Caplet, groused about the ‘‘brusque transition’’ fromthe ‘‘mystical tonepoem’’ byAntonioRosetti (1750–1792) on the first half of the program to Debussy’s ‘‘maliciously puerile’’ ballet pantomime.31 In support of Caplet, he declared La Boıˆte a` 27 Caplet had earlier scored Debussy’s Children’s Corner, which La Boıˆte a` joujoux paraphrases in a couple of places. See Orledge, ‘‘Another Look inside Debussy’s ‘Toybox,’’’ 988. 28 Orledge, Debussy and the Theatre, 372–78, lists all but one of the manuscripts for the ballet preserved at the Bibliothe`que nationale de France; the exception is Fd Vm6 45A, which is Caplet’s annotated copy of the 1913 piano score. The crucial source is Manuscript 979, which shows from page 9 Caplet’s resumption of Debussy’s aborted orchestration. 29 Orledge, Debussy and the Theatre, 179. 30 Sarah Gutsche-Miller has documented Madame Mariquita’s prolific career in the music hall, the Folies-Berge`re, and the Ope ́ra-Comique in ‘‘Pantomime-Ballet on the Music-Hall Stage: The Popularisation of Classical Ballet in Fin-de-Sie`cle Paris’’ (PhD diss., McGill University, 2010). 31 Gaston Carraud, ‘‘La Semaine musicale,’’ Le Me ́nestrel, 19 December 1919, 91. </page> <page sequence="11"> the journal of musicology joujoux a ‘‘masterpiece,’’ but felt that the visual aspect of the production ‘‘lacked merriment’’ and ‘‘seemed a bit thin, a bit bare, as if it had been stretched across the orchestra.’’32 Other reviewers likewise gave themusic the benefit of the doubt, but not the staging.33 The production did not last. Indeed at the end of the 1920–1921 season the The ́aˆtre Lyrique went out of business. Its conductor, De ́sire ́-E ́mile Inghelbrecht (1880–1965), subsequently found work with the Ballets Sue ́dois, as one of four conduc- tors on the company’s payroll, andhe proposedLaBoıˆte a` joujoux to Borlı ̈n and de Mare ́. The Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, 1917, and the French Theater in San Francisco, 1919 The performance at the The ́aˆtre Lyrique du Vaudeville marks the French premiere of La Boıˆte a` joujoux but not its world premiere, despite being credited as such in reprint editions of the original 1913 piano score. And contra Helle ́’s and Debussy’s final conception, children did not appear in the performances—nor would they in the Ballets Sue ́dois production 434 that extended for five seasons beginning in 1921. Children did, however, take the lead in the United States premiere of La Boıˆte a` joujoux, which surprisingly predates its unveiling in France. But the very first perfor- mance of Debussy’s piano score took place only seventeen months after its completion, in a puppet show mounted at a private house in Milan, Italy, the residence of the conductor Guido Carlo Visconti di Modrone (1881–1967).34 32 Ibid. 33 The music critic Charles Tenroc defined the dance, for which he admitted to having no eye, as ‘‘three laps’’ around the set ‘‘and an exit,’’ and mocked the production in general as ‘‘childish nonsense,’’ irrespective of all of the ‘‘talk’’ about ‘‘‘synthetic styliza- tions,’’ and ‘‘sound forms in motion.’’ Tenroc, ‘‘The ́aˆtre-Lyrique (Vaudeville): L’Enfant prodigue—La Damoiselle e ́lue—La Boıˆte a` joujoux—Le Barbier de Se ́ville,’’ Le Courrier musical, 1 January 1920, 10. Jean Bernier behaved better, at least to Debussy: ‘‘The music is surprisingly scenic, nimble, chaste, and lends itself admirably to an orchestration that proved ideal.’’ Bernier, ‘‘Au The ́aˆtre-Lyrique: ‘L’Enfant prodigue,’ ‘La Damoiselle e ́lue,’ ‘La Boıˆte a` joujoux’ de Claude Debussy, joue ́ pour la premie`re fois au The ́aˆtre-Lyrique le 10 de ́cembre 1919,’’ Comoedia illustre ́, 5 January 1920, 135. 34 Surviving documentation includes an attractive program in watercolor dated 24 March 1915, uncovered by Pilar Castro Kiltz at the New York Public Library and described by her in detail in ‘‘La Boıˆte a` joujoux: An Evolving Production History’’ (Senior thesis, Princeton University, 2010). The production seems to have adhered to Helle ́’s scenario but rejected his designs. More significant than the Milanese puppets were those of the Schweizerisches Marionetten-Theater in Zurich. Roger Nichols informs me that on 29 March 1918, Jacques Durand authorized ten performances of La Boıˆte a` joujoux at this theater. The performances occurred between May and August 1918 and featured puppets designed by Otto Morach. Werner Reinhardt directed. </page> <page sequence="12"> morrison figure 1. The Toy Box in San Francisco (Bibliothe`que nationale de France) 435 The first public performance occurred, according to research by Pilar Castro Kiltz, at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City during the 1916 holiday season (precise dates are missing from the New York Public Library records and recollections of the production).35 The scenario was tweaked to omit potentially frightening images, including the glowering constable in the window and Polichinelle’s pea-shooting cannons. Performers, who ranged in age from eight to twelve, acted out the plot to piano accompaniment. How and why the ballet ended up in a low-budget theater of four hundred seats on the Lower East Side of Manhattan during World War I remains unclear. The French cabaret singer Yvette Guilbert (1865–1944) might have arranged for the music to be sent to the United States, and she perhaps passed on the piano score to her close friends Alice and Irene Lewisohn, the sisters who ran the Neighborhood Playhouse. As Kiltz reveals, this forgotten performance had a parallel, likewise previously unknown, across the country. On Friday and Saturday, 21 and 22 February 1919, the The ́aˆtre Franc ̧ais de San Francisco staged La Boıˆte a` joujoux with support from the consul general of France; apparently, 35 Information in this paragraph and the next is taken from Kiltz, ‘‘La Boıˆte a` joujoux.’’ </page> <page sequence="13"> the journal of musicology Debussy’s petite cadeau for Chouchou was promoted abroad before it had even been heard at home. One photograph survives of this staging, showing fourteen beaming children arrayed in front of Helle ́’s wooden animals on a cramped stage (fig. 1). The performance was directed by Andre ́ Ferrier, who in 1925 published a trifling article about his activities with the The ́aˆtre Franc ̧ais de San Francisco but did not say anything about his work on La Boıˆte a` joujoux.36 Partly for this reason, the discre- pancies between the photograph and the surviving program cannot be reconciled. The latter lists twelve girls acting out The Toy Box, whereas fourteen girls and boys are shown in the photograph, with ‘‘Miss Eleo- nor,’’ ‘‘Miss Elberg,’’ and ‘‘Miss Grace’’ taking the parts of ‘‘La Poupe ́,’’ ‘‘Le Soldat,’’ and ‘‘Polichinelle,’’ respectively. There is also no explana- tion for the presence of music stands in the photograph, when the pro- gram states that the ballet was performed with piano accompaniment at the The ́aˆtre Franc ̧ais de San Francisco, just as it had been at the Neigh- borhood Playhouse of New York. The Chamber Theater in Moscow, 1917–1919 and 1929 436 Since the New York and San Francisco productions left so little trace, it would be unkind to accuse Debussy’s publisher of any nationalist bias in crediting the premiere of La Boıˆte a` joujoux to the The ́aˆtre Lyrique in Paris. The The ́aˆtre Lyrique did, after all, perform Caplet’s orchestration. So it would seem that the premiere of the ballet with full orchestral score took place in Paris in 1919. But no: Although Caplet’s orchestration seems to have been the first authorized by the composer,37 it was not the first completed. Someone beat Caplet to the punch. That was Henri Forterre (1882–1958), a French-born, Russian- naturalized musician employed by the State Moscow Chamber Theater (Gosudarstvennı ̈y moskovskiy Kamernı ̈y teatr) from 1915 to 1920. A pro- duct of the Paris Conservatoire, Forterre served as the in-house composer and arranger for the Chamber Theater as well as its bookkeeper.38 He returned to France at the insistence of his homesick wife, thereafter squan- dering his talent in the cabaret and French cinema. ‘‘Leaving, he cried and said that Russia and the Chamber Theater had become his second home,’’ recounted one member of the troupe.39 Maybe so, but an article that 36 Andre ́ Ferrier, ‘‘Un The ́aˆtre franc ̧ais aux Etats-Unis la ‘Gaıˆte ́ franc ̧aise’ de San Francisco,’’ La Nouvelle revue 12, no. 140 (1925): 140–50. 37 Debussy enlisted three composers as assistants for his later works, each of them highly respected: Caplet, Henri Bu ̈sser (1872–1973), and Charles Koechlin (1867–1950). 38 Ar’ye Elkana, Aleksandr—Alisa—Kamernı ̈y teatr (Moscow and Tel Aviv: Kruk, 2009), 385. 39 Alisa Koonen, Stranitsı ̈ zhizni, 1975; as quoted in ibid, 386. </page> <page sequence="14"> morrison Forterre published in 1921 makes clear that his life under the Bolsheviks had been miserable.40 He had survived on rationed coffee, bread, and preserves while holding down jobs at the Chamber Theater, the Theater of the Council of Workers’ Deputies (Teatr sovet rabochikh deputatov), and music clubs in the provinces. Forterre’s boss at the Chamber Theater was the eminent director Aleksandr Tairov (1885–1950), who favored Constructivist designs and followed antirealist trends of the Russian Silver Age in striving for a syn- thesis of de ́cor, gesture, and sound. There were no children in his com- pany, at least not at first; he nurtured actors in their late twenties and thirties, training them at the special school he founded in Moscow in 1918. Tairov’s lead actress and second wife, Alisa Koonen, took the part of the Doll in the Russian premiere of the ballet; in heavy makeup, she looks much older than twenty nine in the earliest photographs of the production. Yashchik s igrushkami premiered in Moscow on 21 December 1917— long before the 10 December 1919 premiere of La Boıˆte a` joujoux in Paris. Thus this previously unknown Russian performance marks the world premiere of the ballet with full orchestral score. Because records of this event do not survive (World War I, the Revolution, and the ensuing Civil 437 War were not exactly kind to theater archivists in Russia), some basic questions go unanswered, chiefly where the premiere occurred. The best guess is Tairov’s haphazardly built theater at 23 Tverskoy Boulevard, but there is no documentation to place the performance there, and no sooner was the show mounted in 1917 than it was struck, the sets and props destined for other venues. The exact location of the premiere simply cannot be pinpointed.41 There is also the question of how Tairov obtained the music. In the first half of December 1913, Debussy conducted in Moscow and St. Peters- burg, but there is no evidence to suggest that he met Tairov, much less gave him a copy of the piano score. Perhaps Forterre, who did know Debussy,42 pressed it into the director’s hands and offered to orchestrate it. Or Tairov might have obtained the music in Paris sometime during 40 H[enri] Forterre, ‘‘Le Gouvernement des soviets et la musique,’’ La Revue musicale 12, no. 9 (1921): 80–85. 41 The performance is mentioned, without the venue being named, in the unsigned review ‘‘Kamernı ̈y teatr,’’ Teatral’nı ̈y kur’yer, 20 February 1918, 4. 42 ‘‘Debussy’s ‘Box of Toys’: As Mimed at the Kamerny Theater, Moscow,’’ Christian Science Monitor, 16 October 1920, 12: ‘‘La Boıˆte a` joujoux reached Moscow through the agency of Henri Forterre, a close friend of Debussy.’’ Though no letters survive between them, the two composers must have known each other, as this source claims.

In August 1914, Tairov miraculously procured a seat on the last train out of Paris, only to confront a ‘‘million calamities’’ upon his return to Moscow, including the disappearance of the people building his theater at 23 Tverskoy Boulevard. ‘‘The workers scattered back to their village, panicked by the war, and work on the theater came to a standstill in the middle of things,’’ he wrote. ‘‘Most of the young men, on whom I had placed such hopes, ended up being conscripted.’’43 Nonetheless, the Chamber Theater opened on 12 December 1914, its meager budget supplemented by the actor Marius Mariusovich Petipa (whose father, the choreographer Marius Petipa, had ruled the Impe- rial Ballet for decades). He provided fifty rubles a month toward the costs of overhead for the 1915–1916 season.44 The theater closed on 12 February 1917. Tairov announced the suspension of operations in a let- ter to the editor of a Russian theater newspaper titled ‘‘No Suffering, No Singing.’’45 There followed a period of improvised reopenings and reclosings: a production of Oscar Wilde’s Salome in Moscow in October 1917; a tour 438 with this same production and others to Petrograd in March of 1918; and another tour to Smolensk,46 after which Tairov brought what re- mained of his original company back to Moscow. The Chamber Theater lost its home at 23 Tverskoy Boulevard but gained access to a mixed-use space located on the bank of the Yauza River—the Vvedensky People’s House (Vvedenskiy narodnı ̈y dom). Tairov also found space in a venue called The Bread Market (Khlebnaya birzha) on Spartakovskaya Plo- shchad, in the Red Rooster Cafe ́ (Kafe ́ ‘‘Krasnı ̈y petukh’’) on Kuznets- kiy Most, and in the inner courtyard of a former mansion on Bolshaya Nikitskaya. Eventually, after People’s Commissar of Enlightenment Anatoliy Lunacharsky was convinced of the director’s commitment to the Bolshevik cause, Tairov was allowed back into the theater on Tvers- koy Boulevard. The chaos of the times is distantly reflected in Tairov’s postperfor- mance reports from 8 December 1918 to 25 January 1919. On 21 Decem- ber, he notes the botched shipment of the de ́cor and props of Yashchik s 43 Aleksandr Tairov, Zapiski rezhissyora (Moscow: Izdaniye Kamernogo teatra, 1921), 39. 44 Ibid, 48.

The show that evening at Vvedensky People’s House was also scrapped: ‘‘Due to the big revolt, communica- tions cut off; the troupe gathered at the assembly point but couldn’t get out. Drew up a report.’’ The 29 December show at the Red Rooster Cafe ́ began an hour and a half late, at 13:30 rather than 12:00. ‘‘No one from the administration of the cafe ́ came. The dressing rooms were locked, there was no poster; it wasn’t tidied up. The arc [presumably a reference to the crescent-shaped overhead storage space] was locked; the director had the key but didn’t turn up.’’47 The Red Rooster Cafe ́, where we know Yashchik s igrushkami was performed in December 1918, had first opened almost a year before, on 20 January, under the name ‘‘Pittoresk’’ (Picturesque). Designed by Georgiy Yakulov (1882–1928), the cafe ́ was intended as a kind of play- ground for Futurist and Constructivist artists, with the dynamic, motion- filled interior having a chandelier of glass and metal, funnel-, spiral-, and wedge-shaped ornaments of cardboard and plywood, and lanterns that projected ‘‘fire-breathing’’ and ‘‘cold’’ colors onto the walls.48 After the Revolution, administration fell under the control of the Theater Direc- 439 torate of the People’s Commissariat for Enlightenment. The fabulous de ́cor vanished; now, as the Red Rooster, it became a club for Bolshevik workers in the arts, colder inside than outside, with audiences puffing acrid-smelling, hand-rolled cigarettes to keep warm. On the bill of fare in the canteen were cold potato pies and sour-milk concoctions of mysteri- ous provenance. According to the urban historian Zinaı ́da Odollams- kaya, source of these details, the exterior of the building remained intact throughout the Stalinist period even as the interior was gutted. Odollamskaya described one of the photographs she found of the build- ing: ‘‘Well, if it looked like this in 1953, it must also have looked like this in 1918. Just add ruin, the husks of sunflower seeds, dead horses on the street, and broken lanterns.’’49 The theater on Bolshaya Nikitskaya could only have been an improvement, though Tairov’s most recent biographer, Mikhaı ́l Levitin, does not agree. He imagined the director in despair, paralyzed by the limitations imposed on him by the Bolsheviks, making bitter jokes about his chamber theater becoming pint-sized: ‘‘What can possibly be done in this poor little theater, devoid of grids, depth, and wings? Won’t Alisa [Koonen] be too upset [to perform]? Is this the Revolution’s joke at my 47 RGALI f. 2030, op. 1, yed. khr. 86 (Zhurnal spektakley), ll. 1–3. 48 http://zinaida-odollamskaya.ya.ru/replies.xml?item_no1⁄41413, accessed 14 July 2012.

These are preserved at the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art, and date from 8, 10, 12, and 14 January 1919.51 The shallow stage at Bolshaya Nikitskaya might have been an impediment to Tairov’s production of the Hindu drama Sakuntala,52 but it suited The Toy Box—as did, in its own way, the need for him to make do with next to nothing. Other documentation of the Moscow productions include twenty-three stage and studio photographs of Yashchik s igrushkami in the Tairov archive, another five in the archive of the collector Vasiliy Vasil- yevich Fyodorov (1891–1973), and one photograph each in the archives of Koonen and the director Kseniya Yakovlevna Butnikova (1897–1992). There also survives a program for a 1918 show at an unnamed venue (probably the Red Rooster Cafe ́). The printed text is hand cor- rected in purple pencil, indicating four changes in the cast, and three possible no-shows. Forterre is credited with the orchestration and Boris Ferdinandov (1889–1959) with the visual design: the costumes, de ́cor, and props (fig. 2). Into the category of fun facts goes the detail that the part of the elephant was played not by a wooden cutout, as Helle ́ spec- 440 ified, but by an actor and actress (surnames Gardt and Ganzhumova) in an animal suit by Ferdinandov. Photographs reveal that Ferdinandov’s costumes suffered the most from the tight budget and material shortages: they are unpressed, ill fitted, and frayed. The makeup is also woeful, roughly and thickly applied, smudged and smeared. The thinking that went into the visual design cost nothing, however, and that thinking was clever. Ferdinandov instructed the actors to begin and end each tableau in Yashchik s igrush- kami pressed up against the set and frozen in place. They were to double, like the props, as wall art. Beside the visual design, Tairov relied on Ferdinandov for much of the commedia dell’arte–inspired pantomime in the production. The surviving visual records and reviews suggest that Yashchik s igrushkami served as a testing ground of sorts for theories of metricized pantomime and the transformation of the actor into an automaton, such that the arms are isolated from the legs, the hands from the feet.

Levitin does not discuss The Toy Box. 51 RGALI f. 2030, op. 2, yed. khr. 46–48. 52 At the time he acquired the score of The Toy Box, Tairov was conducting research for Sakuntala, which starred Koonen. It had a choreographic impulse, drawing inspiration from the dancing of Isadora Duncan; see Lynn Garafola, ‘‘Dance, Film, and the Ballets Russes,’’ Dance Research 16, no. 1 (1988): 10. </page> <page sequence="18"> morrison figure 2. Program for a 1918 performance of The Toy Box by the Chamber Theater in Moscow (RGALI) 441 </page> <page sequence="19"> the journal of musicology later formed the basis of the Heroic Experimental Theater (Opı ̈tno- geroicheskiy teatr) that Ferdinandov established in Moscow in 1921. Credit for the dances in Yashchik s igrushkami goes to Mikhaı ́l Mord- kin (1880–1944), a graduate of the Imperial Ballet School in Moscow who performed with the Ballets Russes in Paris and partnered Anna Pavlova on tour in Europe and America—the zenith of his career. He returned to Moscow before the Revolution and danced at the Bolshoi Theater until 1918, thereafter performing under Forterre’s baton at the Chamber Theater and the Theater of the Council of Workers’ Deputies. To validate his ration card, he appeared in the circus and toured the provinces. He taught movement classes for Tairov before becoming his chosen choreographer.53 The most detailed review of Yashchik s igrush- kami confirms that Mordkin coached Koonen in mime and devised the hard-angled gestures that defined her depiction of the Doll. For her solo turn in the first tableau, he softened the gestures and placed her on the lid of the toy box, teaching her to twirl and fold over like a jewelry-box ballerina. During the episode in the sheepfold, Mordkin had the Doll and the Soldier declare their love by mirroring each other’s arm and hand extensions. The geese were teased according to his instructions, 442 and the backs of the sheep rubbed.54 The Doll (Koonen) performed in physical counterpoint with the Soldier and Polichinelle. The other characters mirrored themselves, left palms facing down and back, right palms facing up and out, and so on. As if hoping to express a child’s unwillingness to distinguish between the real and unreal, animate and inanimate, Ferdinandov fashioned the wooden animals in three dimensions rather than a simulacrum of two. The flesh-and-blood actors, in contrast, pushed and pulled themselves across the stage in a manner that implied height and width but no depth. This illusion is seen in the later photographs; earlier ones suggest the fluffiness and floppiness of Tairov’s contemporaneous staging of Arthur Schnitzler’s Der Schleier der Pierrette (The Veil of Pierrette), under its Rus- sian title Pokrı ̈valo P’errettı ̈.55 The fourth tableau frees the dancers and actors from a single plane as the Doll and Soldier plump up from two dimensions into three. Koonen looks especially matronly in the last of the five photographs from the Fyodorov archive (fig. 3). Taken from the stage, the photograph shows the Doll with three children, all girls, the oldest wearing pointe shoes. It 53 On Mordkin’s work with Tairov, see E[lizaveta] Ya.

The 1929 revival of The Toy Box by the Chamber Theater in Moscow (RGALI) 443 dates from a 1929 revival of Yashchik s igrushkami in Moscow. By that time, Tairov must have seen the Ballets Sue ́dois production of La Boıˆte a` joujoux in Paris and been impressed by it.56 So impressed, in fact, that his restaging of the ballet looks just like Bo ̈rlin’s. The photograph preserved in the Koonen archive, which dates from the March 1918 run-out of Yashchik s igrushkami to Petrograd, blends ghostly silvers and milky greys (fig. 4). The Doll stares stage right, her face framed by a bonnet, her torso and legs folded into a zigzag. Polichinelle looms above her, his nose beaked in accord with commedia dell’arte convention, though without the hunched back and bloated stomach. Two oversized lollipops—Ferdinandov’s and Helle ́’s depiction of trees—form the backdrop. The villain in this production was played by Vladimir Korolev, though the part was often taken by Aleksandr Olenin, with the strikingly handsome Uzbek actor Nikolay Tseretelli (1890–1942), the son of the prince of Bukhara, playing the Soldier. Some of the photographs are grotesque, the limitations of techno- logical reproduction and the loss of the aura of live performance giving them an unintended creepiness. The Polichinelle in particular looks like 56 The State Moscow Chamber Theater went on tour to Paris in 1923. </page> <page sequence="21"> the journal of musicology figure 4. Vladimir Korolev, as Polichinelle, and Alisa Koonen, as the Doll (RGALI) 444 a Halloween collectible. But Yashchik s igrushkami was meant to charm, and the reviewers of Tairov’s staging delighted in his efforts. One of the most remarkable accounts is by the American critic and theatrical agent Oliver M. Sayler, who spent the winter of 1917–1918 in Moscow and Petrograd. He described Tairov’s no-budget staging of Yashchik s igrush- kami as ‘‘a Franco-Russian Mother Goose,’’ offering ‘‘sugar cakes for the </page> <page sequence="22"> morrison nursery age.’’57 Tairov had hung a special curtain ‘‘all dotted over with funny little people, one of them standing on his head and the rest trot- ting around among vari-colored blocks.’’ The pantomime behind the curtain was intended to be realistic—but from the perspective of delighted children, not in the duller minds of adults. Sayler admired the ‘‘open-eyed wonder which the players of the toys maintain[ed] through- out,’’ likewise the stiffness in the nascent action of their arms and legs and the Soldier’s almost-embrace and kiss of the Doll. He was much less enamored of ‘‘the use from time to time of audible sounds characteristic of the action, such as the squeaking of the Doll when the Soldier bends her over, or the sharp clapping of the hands of the little children dol- lies.’’ Sayler may or may not have known that Debussy composed the music based on his memories of his daughter loving her toys to pieces, using misfired harmonies and off-kilter rhythms to represent their fray- ing and falling apart. A similar reaction to Tairov’s staging comes from the poet and one- time Symbolist composer Mikhaı ́l Kuzmin in a 1 April 1919 review in Zhizn’ i iskusstvo (Life and art). Kuzmin begins by praising Koonen’s half- naı ̈ve, half-cynical performance in the role of the Doll, then pulls back to consider the challenge of capturing the immediacy of a child’s experi- 445 ence in a theatrical performance. Making such immediacy the founda- tion of Tairov’s staging would have been ‘‘risky,’’ Kuzmin clarifies, but in this instance ‘‘useful,’’ since Debussy achieved it in his score.58 He argues that Tairov hadmisheard the music, ‘‘taking it to be a stylization of a doll’s woodenness’’ and translating it into mechanical motions reminiscent of Le ́o Delibes’s ballet Coppe ́lia and Jacques Offenbach’s opera The Tales of Hoffmann. Debussy altogether shunned the mechanical, Kuzmin insists: ‘‘This is simple, pure, naı ̈ve, poetic music, devoid of stylization and the automatic.’’ Forterre’s orchestration exacerbated the problems of Tairov’s staging by being ‘‘coarse and monotonous; and since many of Debussy’s phrases had a Russian casting, they were orchestrated just like Rimsky- Korsakov.’’ It also did not help that the musicians played ‘‘sluggishly and sloppily,’’ as he claims ‘‘Modernism’’ demands. 57 This and the following quotations and information are taken from Oliver M. Sayler, The Russian Theatre Under the Revolution (Boston: Little, Brown, 1920), 177–79. Sayler seems also to have been the author of ‘‘Debussy’s ‘Box of Toys,’’’ the unsigned review in the Christian Science Monitor referenced in note 42 above. The descriptions in the two sources are similar, with the latter adding details about the ‘‘Cubist’’ pantomime, Tairov’s reliance on ‘‘gray light’’ to denote dusk and dawn, and the ‘‘curious lassitudinous chord in the music, indicating, perhaps, the irresponsibility of toyland.’’ The merriment of the pro- ceedings, the reviewer emphasized, ‘‘shame[d] the world’s notion of a glum and dour Russia’’ under the ‘‘Bolsheviki.’’ 58 This and the following quotations are taken from M[ikhaı ́l] Kuzmin, ‘‘Yashchik s igrushkami,’’ Zhizn’ i iskusstvo 108 (1 April 1919): 3. </page> <page sequence="23"> the journal of musicology Kuzmin’s review speaks to his own aesthetics, and of the unmediated inspiration that he sought to channel in his poetry. His biographers, John E. Malmstad and Nikolay Bogomolov, have described how some of his writings ‘‘refuse depth,’’ a condition stemming ‘‘not only from Kuzmin’s aesthetics or from his facility in composing seemingly ephem- eral lyrics, but also from his loyalty to the immediacy of life.’’59 Thus, he was interested in how Debussy captured the moment in the moment. He wanted to hear the ballet through innocent ears, like a child who relates to the world without assigning meaning to it. Even though Kuzmin heard the references in Yashchik s igrushkami to other composers—he had an excellent ear and impressive knowledge of the canon—he preferred to free them from their original contexts. He wanted to hear the music in the present, entirely effaced, as if he were no older than ten. Paris (Stockholm), 1921–1925 The Ballets Sue ́dois production of The Toy Box, the best known if not longest lasting, originated as a work expressly for adults. Audience mem- 446 bers might sit through the production as spellbound as children, but it was a muchmore cerebral affair than the matinees presented by the State Moscow Chamber Theater, never mind the Neighborhood Playhouse. Bo ̈rlin’s staging translates the sounding surface of Debussy’s score into a flatness of de ́cor and movement, thus engaging with Modernist aes- thetics. Here the snide quip about Modernist art—even a child could do it—becomes a point of pride. Source records for Leksaksla ̊dan, the Swedish translation of The Toy Box,60 are more complete than those of the other early productions, but historians have been imaginative in filling in the blanks, beginning with the possible metaphoric meanings of the title. The toy box is the ‘‘par- tous,’’ the ‘‘big bed,’’ in Erik Na ̈slund’s words, ‘‘that was the spirit of the 1920s,’’ with ‘‘all the arts coming together and relating to each other.’’61 Nancy Van Norman Baer has pointed out that boıˆte is a colloquialism meaning ‘‘nightclub.’’62 Bo ̈rlin’s toys, she proposes, are out on the town past their bedtime, their antics confirming every child’s well-founded suspicion that all the fun stuff happens at night. In her reading, Helle ́’s miniaturized satire of a music hall revue (the original concept behind 59 John E. Malmstad and Nikolay Bogomolov, Mikhail Kuzmin: A Life in Art (Cam- bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1999), 78. 60 The Ballets Sue ́dois performed the ballet under its French title. I use the Swedish title here to distinguish de Mare ́ and Bo ̈rlin’s staging from others. 61 Na ̈slund, ‘‘Rolf de Mare ́ and Ballets Sue ́dois.’’ 62 Nancy Van Norman Baer, ed., Paris Modern: The Swedish Ballet 1920–1925 (San Francisco: Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, 1995), 156. </page> <page sequence="24"> morrison the ballet) was converted by Bo ̈rlin into a full-scale version of the real thing. Helle ́ himself initially insisted that the 15 February 1921 Ballets Sue ́dois premiere of Leksaksla ̊dan look as much as possible like his orig- inal designs, sending two letters to de Mare ́ on the subject. (The first of these predates the premiere by a month or so; the second one postdates it by two days.)63 Countering Bo ̈rlin’s inclination to complicate the behavior of the toys, Helle ́ gently maintained that less is more. Over time, both men adjusted their ideas. As the production matured, Bo ̈rlin roughed up the behavior of the toys, and Helle ́ changed his designs to make themmore abstract. He informed de Mare ́, in a third letter dated 17 June 1923, that the stripes on the tiger needed to be ‘‘simpler’’ and less ‘‘realistic,’’ the hats on the soldiers perfectly squared (he made a ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘bad’’ cartoon to illustrate this point), and the cardboard-ness of the cardboard props emphasized.64 Helle ́ adjusted the colors of the costumes so that, for example, the black and yellow stripes on the hem, neckline, and sleeves of the Doll’s dress matched those on the belt, neckline, and sleeves of the Soldier’s uniform while also harmonizing with the thick black lines shaping the geese and sheep. For the costume of the gro- tesquely antiballetic Polichinelle, Helle ́ strove for contrast, mixing fabrics 447 and mismatching stripes. The Polichinelle ended up looking like a Mon- drian painting. The set designs, inscribed ‘‘A` monsieur Rolf de Mare ́, en cordial et sympatique homage,’’65 reflect this same impulse to abstraction (fig. 5). If stared at long enough, the geometric shapes in the backdrop of the first tableau assemble into a pinwheel and a sailboat. The dominant object is not the toy box or the phonograph but the squares-within-a- square arrangement of a checkerboard. The checkerboard, being a grid, insists on flatness and defies the space of the real, the natural.66 Likewise the action of the middle tab- leaus is pushed up as much as possible to the front of the stage to erase a sense of depth (fig. 6). The house and trees in the fourth tableau assume anthropomorphic shapes; the smokestacks have outstretched arms and the trunks slanted torsos. For Helle ́, much more so than for Bo ̈rlin, the world inside the toy box became the world of analytic Cubism —concerned with angles, planes, and juxtaposed external perspectives. 63 Dansmuseet, Svenska Balletten, ‘‘La Boıˆte a` joujoix’’ (documents). 64 Ibid. 65 Dansmuseet, Svenska Baletten, ‘‘La Boıˆte a` joujoux’’ (de ́cor images). 66 On the Modernist grid, see Rosalind Kraus, ‘‘Grids,’’ October 9 (Summer 1979), 50– 64; reprinted in Kraus, The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths (Cam- bridge, MA: MIT Press, 1985). </page> <page sequence="25"> the journal of musicology figure 5.

Gotthard Johansson, for one, complimented Leksaksla ̊dan for its ‘‘exploitation of cubist painting.’’68 Another treated Leksaksla ̊dan as a spiritual exercise in which ‘‘wooden puppets,’’ having been ‘‘transfig- ured by the painter,’’ mark ‘‘for the first time the lyrical cult of the transformation of all the realities’’; this second quotation comes from a souvenir program for a run of performances by the Ballets Sue ́dois at the Sloane Square Court Theater in London in the autumn of 1922, followed by appearances in Brighton, Hull, Newcastle, and Glasgow.69 The heady quote was used as advertising copy, intended to sell the ballet to the British public, even as that ballet lost its smooth, creaseless Cubist sheen. Judging from the photographs taken by Central News, Helle ́’s costumes and backcloths were not kept in decent repair and replaced as required—standard practice for ballet companies. The extensive tours taken by the Ballets Sue ́dois to New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, casi- nos and resorts in France and Switzerland, the capitals of Scandinavia, and smaller towns in Italy,70 took their toll on the costumes and back- cloths, but actually they should not have looked as bad as they did. 449 Something was going wrong backstage. Most commentators on Leksaksla ̊dan focused on the pantomime and dances and their relationship (or nonrelationship) with the de ́cor and music. Depending on the reviewer’s tolerance for the antiballetic, Bo ̈rlin was either lauded for his ‘‘obstinate propagation of French music and de ́cor’’71 or scorned for it. The least impressed by the effort was doubtless Jean Martet, a poet and novelist who served as secretary to Georges Clemenceau. He declared, at the start of a protracted temper tantrum in the French nationalist newspaperL’Homme libre, that he had no patience for the Ballets Sue ́dois, ‘‘a ballet in which no one dances.’’72 To emphasize its Swedish foreignness—and, by extension, its calculated affront to a post- war Gallic sensibility—he listed the most Swedish-sounding surnames of 67 Mel Bochner, ‘‘Why Would Anyone Want to Draw on the Wall?’’ October 130 (Fall 2009): 135–40, esp. 135. 68 As quoted in Bengt Ha ̈ger, Rolf de Mare ́s Svenska Balett (Stockholm: Lindfors, 1947), 70. 69 Dansmuseet, Svenska Baletten, Pressurklipp Bok 6. 70 The tours are listed by George Dorris in ‘‘The Choreography of Jean Borlin: A Checklist with the Tours and Personnel of Les Ballets Sue ́dois,’’ Dance Chronicle 22, no. 2 (1999): 189–222, esp. 220–21. 71 Louis Laloy, ‘‘Au The ́aˆtre des Champs-Elyse ́es: Jeux et La Boıˆte a` joujoux de Claude Debussy, Divertissement de Chopin, Ibe ́ria d’Albeniz,’’ Comoedia, 18 February 1921; Dans- museet, Svenska Baletten, Pressurklipp Bok 2. 72 This and the following quotations from Jean Martet, ‘‘Ballets Sue ́dois,’’ L’Homme libre, 21 February 1921; Dansmuseet, Svenska Baletten, Pressurklipp Bok 2. </page> <page sequence="27"> the journal of musicology the dancers: Eltorp, Lindgren, Stettler. (There were non-Swedes in the company, including one with the surname Smith, but Martet did not bother with them.) As for Leksaksla ̊dan itself, Martet declared that ballets should, by definition, concern themselves with the struggle of ‘‘mind over matter.’’ Such was their focus in the past, and such should be their focus in the present. ‘‘The first thing I ask of a dance is not to be irritated,’’ Martet declared, after describing his annoyance with the ‘‘sashaying,’’ ‘‘tumbling down in pieces,’’ and ‘‘advancing and retreating with legs stiffened’’ in Leksaksla ̊dan. (He seems to have in mind here the performance of Carina Ari in the role of the shepherdess and Holger Mehnen in the role of the Soldier.)While directing his ire at Bo ̈rlin, who he claimed had ignored the subtleties of Debussy’s music, Martet also chided Helle ́ for the costumes. For one thing, they did not fit the dancers; for another, they covered up their arms and legs, enhancing the clumsiness and heaviness of a produc- tion that should have been all sweetness and light. Martet touched on Bo ̈rlin’s (like Tairov’s) recourse to commedia dell’arte stylization and the privileging of angular movements—the presentation of the dancers to the right and left, front and back, in two dimensions. But the extreme artifice of the production infuriated him: ‘‘There was no dance,’’ he seethed, just 450 a group of artists being ‘‘extremely conscientious in their farce,’’ who might as well have been putting on a ballet about a ‘‘fruit bowl, sugar tongs, and a napkin.’’ What Martet meant as an insult Bo ̈rlin might have taken as a compli- ment. The choreographer acknowledged having drawn inspiration from the visual arts, declaring, in a 1923 Ballets Sue ́dois program booklet, that ‘‘each painting that makes an impression on me is unconsciously trans- formed into a dance . . .Not that I have ever had the idea of reproducing these paintings in tableaux vivants, but they have awakened in me new thoughts, new ideas, and new forms.’’73 Befitting the inanimate subject matter of Leksaksla ̊dan, he choreographed symmetrical Cubist arrange- ments, though he also took care to differentiate the dancers in their solo turns.74 Bo ̈rlin is absent from the surviving photographs, which is somewhat surprising, since he often took the lead roles in his ballets. The dance historian George Dorris noted with an exclamation point that Bo ̈rlin danced some nine hundred times with the Ballets Sue ́dois, and that he also created all of its dances (disregarding the choreographic experience 73 As quoted in George Dorris, ‘‘Jean Borlin as Dancer and Choreographer,’’ Dance Chronicle 22, no. 2 (1999): 167–88, esp. 177. 74 The details are preserved in the extant studio and stage photographs of the pro- duction taken by Agence M. Rol, Isabey de Paris, Max Erlanger de Rosen, and Central News. These are cataloged at the Stockholm Dance Museum by number. </page> <page sequence="28"> morrison of other members of the organization).75 De Mare ́, Bo ̈rlin’s long-time lover as well as his sponsor, encouraged him to steal the limelight, which caused resentment in the ranks and some hotheaded resignations.76 But he is nowhere to be seen in Leksaksla ̊dan, having ceded the role of the Soldier to Holger Mehnen, who possessed chiseled facial features and eyes devoid of emotion. The most striking photographs are of the Danish-born dancer Axel (Oscar) Witzansky (1895–1968), who poses in the studio shots like a splayed pair of scissors in the costume of the Polichinelle.77 His nose and chin are misshapen, his wrists rotated in opposite directions, his heels turned in and hoisted in demi-pointe, knees in demi-plie ́. He moved ‘‘bizarrely’’ on stage, according to the dance critic Raymond Charpentier, ‘‘as if we see his strings being pulled by a child’s hand.’’78 The other lead roles, the Doll and Soldier, are underrepresented in the photos. (It merits noting that Jolanda Figoni, the Doll, did not survive the complete run of the ballet. She died of tuberculosis on 16 October 1924, just twenty years old. Her star performance as the Doll is immortalized in four bound pages of press clippings at the Bibliothe`que nationale de France, some of them predating the premiere.) Kaj Smith (1893–1979), who is purported to have had a greater technical range than Bo ̈rlin,79 451 appears as the Harlequin in one of the studio images; Carina Ari (1897– 1970) is in the role of the Shepherdess, posing with a blank stare and uncoordinated arms and hands in an oversized costume. Charpentier likened her to a ‘‘broken or badly made doll’’ who ‘‘limps endearingly.’’80 Besides Bo ̈rlin, who was destined for a bathetic end,81 little is known about the Ballets Sue ́dois dancers. Ari, however, had the kind of rags-to- riches life that fascinates biographers, including Erik Na ̈slund.82 In her childhood, she hawked decorative flower arrangements on the streets of Stockholm before training at the Swedish Royal Opera, where she met Bo ̈rlin. In 1919, following two summers of performances with the Swed- ish Ballet at the Tivoli Theater in Copenhagen, she apprenticed with 75 Dorris, ‘‘Jean Borlin as Dancer and Choreographer,’’ 185. 76 Ibid, 183–85. 77 His brother Paul Witzansky was also a regular in the Ballets Sue ́dois. 78 As quoted in Bengt Ha ̈ger, Ballets Sue ́dois, trans. Ruth Sharman (London: Thames and Hudson, 1990), 121. 79 This according to Florence Gilliam, as quoted in Lynn Garafola, Legacies of Twentieth-Century Dance (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 2005), 119. 80 Ha ̈ger, Ballets Sue ́dois, 121. 81 After de Mare ́ shut down the Ballets Sue ́dois, Bo ̈rlin tried for a career in cinema while continuing to perform as a soloist, but alcohol, opium, and the weight gain that accompanied the substance abuse brought his life to a sudden end in 1930. He was thirty- seven years old.

The following year, she appeared in a night-at-the-theater epi- sode in the Swedish film Erotikon,83 thereafter signing a three-year con- tract with the Ballets Sue ́dois. (Na ̈slund notes that the director of the film, Mauritz Stiller, gave Greta Garbo her first big break; her career is what Ari’s might have been.)84 In 1925, Ari married the conductor of the Ballets Sue ́dois, Desire ́-E ́mile Inghelbrecht, after a long affair that took the sting out of her falling-out with de Mare ́ over her flirtations with the silver screen. There followed a spectacular series of appearances with the Paris Ope ́ra-Comique, where Ari also directed, and, following her retire- ment from dance, modest success as a sculptor. Her second husband, with whom she settled in Buenos Aries, left her a fortune earned in the liqueur business, which she used to establish a foundation, in her own name, for retired dancers. Ari appeared more Spanish than Swedish, and both she and her biographers have wondered whether her father was someone other than the man who signed her birth certificate. Her generous facial features suited her for toyland, but her Erotikon curves were out of place; Bo ̈rlin assigned her the least erotic role of all in Leksaksla ̊dan, that of the rotund, 452 off-kilter shepherdess. The role of the Doll, for which—given the finesse and nuance in her limbs—Ari seemed the best suited within the Ballets Sue ́dois ranks, went instead to the chaste, short-lived Jolanda Figoni. She seems to have been able to do the thing Ari could not do: move as if ‘‘perched on stilts.’’85 Though the photographic records of the production are compelling, the more significant surviving documents are Bo ̈rlin’s choreographic notes.86 There are five folders, the fifth and largest containing sixty-two pages of cramped jottings in Swedish and French for different Ballets Sue ́dois stagings. Some of the pages are torn, some embossed with the word ‘‘Stockholm.’’ Preserved are the steps for the polka in the fourth tableau of Leksaksla ̊dan, along with a Russian squat dance, which was not a part of Helle ́ and Debussy’s original conception of the ballet. The notes also include the step-by-step, count-by-count instructions for the solo turn of the commedia dell’arte Harlequin in the first tableau, as well as those for ‘‘Pierrot,’’ an obvious stand-in for ‘‘Petrushka’’ of Bal- lets Russes fame. Like the Russian squat dance, this character was also 83 The film is not quite what the title suggests; it is a light social satire involving an entomologist, his attractive, supportive niece, his bored wife, the sculptor for whom she feigns love, and the Red Baron pilot who steals her heart. 84 Na ̈slund, ‘‘Carina Ari,’’ 74. 85 Raymond Charpentier, as quoted in Ha ̈ger, Ballets Sue ́dois, 121. 86 The notes (koreografiska anteckningar) are preserved at the Stockholm Dance Museum. </page> <page sequence="30"> morrison not part of the original conception of the ballet. Bo ̈rlin further expanded the cast to include a second Doll and a Sailor, and assigned the Russian squat dance to them. The duet was inserted at rehearsal 21 in the first tableau of Debussy’s score as the ‘‘Ronde ge ́ne ́rale.’’ One of the stage photographs shows Astrid Lindgren and Paul Witzansky in the roles of the second Doll and Sailor, simultaneously saluting, squatting, and linking arms. The notes reveal that doubling and two-by-two processions were important to Bo ̈rlin in setting the music to dance. Harlequin and Pierrot team up, as do the Sailor and the English Soldier (this character is no longer in black face, since Bo ̈rlin opted to assign the cakewalk to an exoticized ‘‘Ne`gre’’). The part of the Shepherdess is twinned with a Shep- herd, another new character performed by Paul Witzansky in the third tableau after he quickly changed costumes from the Sailor in the first tableau and a rank-and-file soldier in the vegetable battle of the second tableau. Once the notes are deciphered, Bo ̈rlin’s juxtapositions of traditional movements, pantomime, and static poses become clear. He conceived, for example, the following crammed litany for Pierrot’s solo entrance: ‘‘run position right foot with the left on in the air pas de basque repeat 453 left rapidly back stamp twice double brise ́ rond de jambe repeat left quickly back changement run with jumps towards the door, shyly, timidly twice—pantomime—pause e ́chappe ́ in first—pas de boure ́e pas de bas- que alternating two small brise ́s clench toes pas de bourre ́e high jumps— pantomime—end.’’87 There are oddities in his script like ‘‘horse jumps’’ and ‘‘old bravura steps,’’ along with several actions (leaden pacing, for example) that the academic guardians of technique would count among the deadly sins. Individual pages detail Bo ̈rlin’s references to other choreographers, chiefly Fokine and Nijinsky, in his script for Leksaksla ̊dan—a rendering in movement of Debussy’s musical references to other composers. Petrushka was a guaranteed source of inspiration for both of them, but Bo ̈rlin, as mentioned, took a step further than Debussy by actually including the character of ‘‘Pierrot,’’ aka Petrushka, in the cast list. That the choreographic notes are so messy is telling; so too is their occasional repetition—the overlaps between the scripts Bo ̈rlin conceived for the two dozen ballets and eighteen solos and shorter dances that he made. The scraps of paper tell a tale of mixing and matching, of 87 Jean Bo ̈rlin, koreografiska anteckningar, folder no. 5, Dansmuseet.

The notes for the character Harlequin appear to derive, at least in part, from a solo of the same name performed by Bo ̈rlin in his 1920 Paris debut recital. And there was more than one Pierrot and Ne`gre in his arsenal.88 De Mare ́ preserved the notes in what Dorris calls ‘‘an act of expiation,’’89 atone- ment for the creative burden he placed on Bo ̈rlin before abandoning him, and that Bo ̈rlin placed on himself. His references to his own works and those of others made the choreography of Leksaksla ̊dan almost as layered, almost as much a concatenation of metaphor, as Debussy’s music for it. Bengt Ha ̈gar, the founder of the Dance Museum, commen- ted that this choreography did more to bring that music to the public at large, owing to the globe-trotting of the Ballets Sue ́dois, than any other choreography conceived for it, before or after.90 Leksaksla ̊dan, one of just two ballets to remain in the repertoire of the Ballets Sue ́dois from its first season to its last, survives almost whole in the DanceMuseum. It could be hypothetically reconstructed from the sources but would probably end up looking more like a flipbook than a story- book. Even if the notation were complete, the specific bodies to which 454 Bo ̈rlin tailored his pantomime and dances could not be brought back to life (here toys have an advantage over people), nor could the sound of the The ́aˆtre-des-Champs-Elyse ́es orchestra be restored and, with it, In- ghelbrecht’s conducting technique. Not to mention the ballet’s distant origins in the music hall and Helle ́’s Noah’s Ark. The original de ́cor and costumes might be newly repaired and refurbished, but music intended to be out-of-sync with the dance for which it was written cannot, by definition, serve as the basis for reconstructing that dance. The eye was not meant to follow the viewpoint of the sound.91 Thus the early history of The Toy Box, from forgotten performances to fragmentary sources, attests to the fundamental instabilities of ballet, its erasure through time and continuing possibility for reinvention. That 88 The first production of the Ballets Sue ́dois, in fact, was titled Sculpture Ne`gre; it premiered on 25 March 1920. 89 Dorris, ‘‘Jean Borlin as Dancer and Choreographer,’’ 187. 90 Ha ̈ger, Ballets Sue ́dois, 25. 91 The plusses, minuses, and inherent paradoxes of choreographic reconstruction became subjects of debate following Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer’s production of Le Sacre du printemps for the Joffrey Ballet in 1987. Celebration of the purported finding of this lost masterpiece morphed into condemnation once critics began scrutinizing Hodson and Archer’s research methods. Now the production is billed as a ‘‘recreation’’ based on the ideas of the original choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky. On Hodson and Archer’s follow-up project, a production of Debussy’s and Nijinsky’s Jeux (1913) for Verona Ballet in 1996, see Samuel N. Dorf, review of Nijinsky’s Bloomsbury Ballet: Reconstruction of the Dance and Design of ‘‘Jeux,’’ by Millicent Hodson, Journal of the American Musicological Society 65, no. 1 (Spring 2012): 272–84, esp. 278–83. </page> <page sequence="32"> morrison erasure should not be overinterpreted in this instance as a metaphor for the passing of childhood. (Children, after all, do not perceive the tran- sience of their own existence; only adults do, through the looking glass of memory.) To engage in the exercise of reconstruction would be to miss the point of a ballet that embraces the imagined over the real and, paradoxically, the permanence of the ephemeral. The world inside the toy box is one that rejects the object-ness of objects—especially emphat- ically in the Sue ́dois production—and so captures the essence of child- hood as best as grownups can do. Somewhere in Moscow, 1933 But then there is the world outside of the toy box, the land that fun forgot. In 1933, the little-known Soviet composer Vladimir Kochetov (1898– 1951), the son and grandson of much more prominent musicians,92 discovered Debussy’s ballet—perhaps in Forterre’s orchestration—and decided to turn it into something with Soviet mass appeal. He cleaned up the harmonies, pressed the seams in the forms, and knit together a new 455 ‘‘jazz overture’’ for The Toy Box. There exist no recordings of this or any of Kochetov’s other arrangements, and no publications about his career longer than a page (apart from a selection of journal entries and letters from World War II).93 He is credited in Russian and Soviet musical encyclopedias for his service to Soviet children, and for his use of the ‘‘musical folklore of the peoples of the USSR, Spain, France, Yugoslavia, and other nations’’ in the bonbons he confected for them.94 He also produced hackwork for the Stalinist regime, with nice commissions for a hymn to the eleventh brigade of communist combatants in the Spanish Civil War, his piano-vocal cycle ‘‘Children of the Peoples’’ (Deti naro- dov), and the mass song ‘‘We’re All Soldiers’’ (Mı ̈ vse soldatı ̈). En route to becoming a patriotic citizen composer, Kochetov played with French and Italian music of the 17th and 18th centuries, a` la the neoclassical Stravinsky. He also explored American ragtime, producing a ‘‘Boston’’ waltz, a ‘‘Florida’’ Charleston, and an untitled flamenco, foxtrot, and tango. Other scores, produced and published under the pseudonym V. Mimav- Amid, bear the racist titles ‘‘Negro Round Dance’’ (Negrityanskiy 92 His father, Nikolay Razumnikovich Kochetov (1864–1925), earned modest renown as a composer, conductor, and critic; his grandmother, Aleksandra Dormidontovna Aleksandrova-Kochetova (1833–1903), a famous soprano, taught alongside Chaikovsky at the Moscow Conservatoire and premiered several of his romances. 93 Vadim [Vladimir] Nikolayevich Kochetov, ‘‘Iz dnevnikovı ̈kh zapisey—Pis’ma s se- vernogo flota,’’ Sovetskaya muzı ̈ka 6 (1969): 90–95. 94 See www.music-dic.ru/html-music-keld/k/3486.html, accessed 14 July 2012. </page> <page sequence="33"> the journal of musicology khorovod) and ‘‘Taboo’’; there is also a ragtime-inspired ballet on the subject of Till Eulenspiegel, composed in 1940.95 During World War II, Kochetov served in the Northern Fleet of the Soviet Navy and toiled for ‘‘a year and a half on songs for the Red Army.’’96 The place and date of the premiere of his jazz overture for The Toy Box is unknown. Kochetov’s eighteen-page autograph score, preserved at the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art,97 was cut and pasted together using snippets of another, earlier manuscript for string-based chamber orchestra. The desiccated earlier manuscript shows another hand—pre- sumably that of Henri Forterre, the original Moscow orchestrator of the ballet for Tairov’s Chamber Theater.98 Debussy’s musical collage of nine- teenth- and twentieth-century sources was now a literal collage, fashioned from snippets of the piano score and Forterre’s orchestration. The cover of the jazz overture, dated 13 July 1933, is decorated with an awkward attempt at jazzy lettering and an image from Helle ́’s scenario (figs. 7 and 8). The same archival file includes a set of uncorrected parts for the jazz overture in Kochetov’s hand, but not for the rest of the ballet. Kochetov perhaps intended his assemblage for a mixed-program radio broadcast, the Theater of Workers’ Children (Teatr rabochikh rebyat), or the State 456 Central Puppet Theater (Gosudarstvennı ̈y tsentral’nı ̈y teatr kukol)—all venues he wrote for during the 1920s and 1930s. Or perhaps it was meant for the Moscow Choreographic School (Moskovskoye khoreografiches- koye uchilishche), where he taught from 1932 to 1937, following eight years of work as a silent movie accompanist. The straightforward cheerfulness of Kochetov’s arrangement pro- vides the best clue about its target audience. The themes he chose to highlight are precisely those associated with Polichinelle and his mini- ons, but without the edge. Debussy’s (Forterre’s) delicate strings are replaced by a chorus of chortling saxophones (one piccolo, two altos, and one tenor), and the celesta with banjo and xylophone. An E   tuba and drum-kit bass drum hold down the beat from start to finish, and the piano maintains single-chord vamps. Fragments of Debussy’s syncopated cakewalk are passed in imitation from the saxophones to muted trum- pets and trombones before ceding to a twofold expansion of his para- phrase of Gounod’s ‘‘Soldiers’ Chorus.’’ Kochetov recapitulates the cakewalk (stretto imitation this time around) before inserting a fragment of the polka from the fourth tableau of the ballet. The rhythmic motives 95 These details are from the catalog of Kochetov’s archive at RGALI. 96 Kochetov, ‘‘Iz dnevnikovı ̈kh zapisey,’’ 93. 97 RGALI f. 2037, op. 4, yed. khr. 57. 98 Regrettably, no other trace of Forterre’s 1917 orchestration of the ballet and no other manuscripts in the Paris and Moscow archives survive that could be used to confirm his handwriting. </page> <page sequence="34"> morrison figure 7.

This is anti-elitist music for the people —a Stalinist burlesque about as far removed from French Symbolism as can be imagined. Kochetov aspired ‘‘to eliminate the division between ‘agitational’ and ‘art’ music,’’99 and his jazz overture was one such effort. 99 S.

Instead of scolding Kochetov for tearing De- bussy’s score apart, we might admire him for making something new from its pieces. Princeton University ABSTRACT Research in Moscow, New York, Paris, and Stockholm uncovers the compositional and early performance histories of Debussy’s ballet pan- tomime for children, The Toy Box. Surprisingly, the first large-scale pro- duction took place in Moscow, not Paris, and Henri Forterre—in advance of Andre ́ Caplet—completed the orchestration after Debussy’s death. Theater directors and choreographers variously interpret Debussy’s distinctive approach to creating music for children as having been influenced by the designs of his scenarist, Andre ́ Helle ́. Although newly uncovered source materials might permit a reconstruction of The Toy Box, to do so would be to violate the spirit of the ballet, which embraces the imagined over the real and, paradoxically, the permanence 459 of the ephemeral.
