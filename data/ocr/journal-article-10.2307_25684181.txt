<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mapping the Literary to the Literal Image A Comparison Between Sub-metaphors of the Heavenly Warrior Metaphor in the Hebrew Psalter and Iconographic Elements of the Storm- and Warrior-god Ba'al in ANE Iconography Martin G. Klingbeil Summary In a paper read at the International SBL meetings in Vienna, 2007,1 discussed the relationship between the literary and literal image. Taking metaphor as the most prominent trope of biblical imagery, I concentrated on the relationship between metaphors in the Hebrew Bible and iconographic objects in the ANE. My preliminary conclusion was that while both are independent forms of communication which need to be understood in their own right, they nevertheless are linked to each other via the conceptual metaphor and converge in the concept of what constitutes an image. Thus the literary and literal images can rightfully be related to each other as done liberally in iconographic studies that deal with exegetical issues. In the present study I would like to take the analysis of the relationship between the literal and literary image one step further. Metaphors of the divine in the Hebrew Psalter can be categorized in domains of main metaphors and their corresponding sub-metaphors. Deities as depicted in ANE iconography also exhibit certain sets of attributes which in turn classify them as the respective deity. A comparison of the Heavenly Warrior metaphor in the Hebrew Psalter together with its corresponding sub-metaphors, and iconographic depictions of the Storm- and Warrior-god Ba'al with their respective sets of attributes will try to answer the question as to how complex the level of interaction between the literary and the literal image can be established. i. Introduction: Picking up the threads From the beginnings of iconographic research within the discipline of biblical studies, ANE images as found on different media have been related to texts from the Hebrew Bible,1 and any attempts to develop iconographic hermeneutics need to take place within the juxtaposition of text and image. Methodologi cal considerations concerning the relationship between image and text were initially addressed mainly from the perspective of art history,2 with the focus 1 For a detailed analysis of iconographic studies relating to the text of the Hebrew Bible, cf. Izaak J. de Hulster, "Illuminating Images: An Iconographic Method of Old Testament Exegesis with Three Case Studies from Third Isaiah" (Ph.D. diss., University of Utrecht, 2008), 21-155. 2 A comprehensive methodology of iconographic research from the Fribourg School is still a desideratum. Publications raising methodological consideration on a larger scale are mostly limited to the following: Othmar Keel, Deine Blickesind wie Tauben: zur Metaphorik des Hohen Liedes (SBS 114/115; Stuttgart: Katholisches Bibelwerk, 1984); idem, Das Recht der Bildergese Die Welt des Orients, 39.

Klingbeil of iconographic interpretation being mainly on the reconstruction of ancient Israelite religion.3 More recent methodological studies have begun to address the hermeneutic dimension of iconographic studies and its function in biblical exegesis. Especially the study of biblical metaphor as the most frequent trope of biblical imagery has invited the use of iconography as an additional and relevant tool for its interpretation.4 In a paper read at the International SBL/EABS meetings in Vienna, 2007,5 I discussed the relationship between the literal and literary image, since it forms the basic presupposition underlying any discussion on iconographic exegesis. While this relationship is taken a prion in most iconographic studies, it ap peared necessary to define the viability and validity of the relationship between the two conceptual domains. In the following I would like to rephrase the ba sic conclusions of the paper that suggested that there is indeed a relationship between the literal and the literary image: (1) Literary and literal image are two independent forms of communication that first need to be understood in their own right before being related to each other. While traditionally the focus in biblical studies has been on verbal im agery (metaphor, metonomy, symbols, etc.), the literal image has not received the attention it merits and has by and large not moved beyond the realm of illustration of texts.6 (2) Metaphor has progressed towards its own hermeneutics taking into consideration semantics, pragmatics, intertextuality, and cognitive linguistics,7 hen zu warden.

Between Metaphor and Icon: Relating the Literal to the Literary Image" (paper presented at the Annual International Congress of the SBL and Annual Congress of the European Association of Biblical Studies, Vienna, Austria, 22-26 July 2007). 6 One should not underestimate the illustrative force of iconography for biblical studies: Martin G.

Enns; Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2008), 621-631. 7 This is based on a discussion of recent studies in biblical metaphor theory with a focus on the Hebrew Psalter in which I come to the following conclusion: "I can see three important angles emerging from the recent discussion of metaphor criticism, from which the study of metaphor</page><page sequence="3">Mapping the Literary to the Literal Image 207 while iconography is in the process of developing and hopefully following its own hermeneutics which is also the objective of the current study.8 (3) There is a reciprocal relationship between linguistic metaphor and ANE iconographic object that converge in the concept of what constitutes an image. (4) Verbal, mental and material image are sub-domains that draw from the same domain. While the en- and decoding-processes of the communicative expression in the different domains are multiple, they nevertheless respond to the overarching domain of image. It follows on that literary and literal image can rightfully be related to each other. Izaak de Hulster, in his doctoral dissertation defended in January 2008 at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands comes to similar conclusions regarding the relationship between verbal, mental and material image: Metaphor bridges the gap between text and image, it provides picturing, figurative and visualizing language, but expressed in images. It is able to uncover the mental map of a language user group.... metaphor as a figurative verbal image (metaphor as a literary device) is related to conceptual metaphor as a figurative intersubjective mental image_conceptual metaphor, material artificial images can contribute to the understanding of figurative verbal images ....9 The present study wants to take the alignment of literary and literal image one step further in trying to establish the level of correlation between the two in the Psalms should be approached: (1) Semantics and Pragmatics: the study of metaphor in the Palms has to be in reference to both semantics and pragmatics, taking into consideration both meaning and usage. This implies a close look at the cultural and social context of the metaphor, including the literal ANE image. (2) Cognitive Linguistics: metaphors transmit content but also no-content, drawing at the same time on different domains of knowledge and combining them in a new and creative way; they structure our thinking theologically through what they tell us and what not. Metaphors in the Psalms can be cognitively organized and represent universal truths that cannot be expressed otherwise. Therefore, they have a rhetorical or ideological force that should not be underestimated. (3) Intertextuality: Metaphors have a chronological aspect and appear on a time-line; they should be studied with reference to their usage and re-usage in biblical texts which through intertextual markers indicate that they refer to the same metaphor, possibly shifting or creating its meaning along the way. In this way, metaphors in the Psalms can help us to reconstruct the religious history of the OT and help us to understand our own modern and personal religious histories." Martin G.

A Study of the Use, Function and Significance ofMetaphors in Isaiah 24-27 (Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium 151; Leuven: Peeters, 2000). 8 The most synthetic work on the subject is de Hulster's doctoral dissertation which states as its research objective: "Being aware of the lack of explicit theoretical reflection in studies linking texts with images, this project aims to investigate the possibilities for an iconographic method in exegesis of the Old Testament." De Hulster, "Illuminating Images", 4. 9 Ibid., 270.</page><page sequence="4">208 Martin G. Klingbeil concepts on a semantic level, whereas the semantics of iconography need to be established on a theoretical level. The theory of biblical metaphor from a cognitive linguistics perspective has provided us with a notion of the se mantic fields that are mapped to each other within the process of metaphor decoding.10 These fields are constituents of the particular metaphor and also characterize and identify it to such an extent that the metaphor is recogniz able as such to the recipient whose cultural perspective in turn acts upon the decoding process. As mentioned above, as much as the metaphor points to the iconographic object, the iconographic object relates to the metaphor. "As a counterpart of the iconicity of metaphor, material images picture metaphors."11 In this way, metaphor theory also has relevance for the interpretation of an iconographic image and one could expect similar "semantic fields" underlying a literal image. In the following we will look at the semantics of a particular biblical metaphor, i.e. the Heavenly Warrior metaphor as traced through the Hebrew Psalter, and map it to iconographic depictions of the storm- and warrior-god Ba'al with their respective sets of iconographic elements12 in order to answer the question as to how complex the level of semantic interaction between the literary and the literal image can be established. 10 Kittay and Lehrer combined semantic field theory with the idea of conceptual metaphor as proposed by Lakoff and Johnson. Cf. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Metaphors we live by (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980); see also Eva E Kittay and Adrienne Lehrer, "Semantic Fields and the Structure of Metaphor," Studies in Language 5.1 (1981): 31-63. 11 De Hulster, "Illuminating Images", 268. 12 E.g. attributes as iconographic elements: Attributes are recurring pictorial elements that help to identify: 1. if the image is depicting a god or not; 2. what specific type of deity is depicted (e.g., warrior-god or fertility-goddess); and 3. if the depicted god can be identified specifi cally by name (e.g., Reshef or Ea). Cf. Izak Cornelius, The Iconography of the Canaanite Gods Reshef and Ba'al: Late Bronze and Iron Age I Periods (OBO 140; Fribourg/Gottingen: Uni versity Press/Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1994), 14-16. One has to observe at this stage that the typology of ANE gods to a certain extent is subjected to circular reasoning as Schwemer observes: "Vielmehr entstand der Gottertyp im Ruckgriff auf diejenigen Texte, die ihm nun wieder zugeordnet werden...." Daniel Schwemer, Die Wettergottgestalten Mesopotamiens und Nordsyriens im Zeitalter der Keilschriftkulturen. Materialien und Studien nach den schriftlichen Quellen (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2001), 8. While Schwemer comprehensively deals with the textual material of the storm-gods, he rarely touches on the iconographic evidence and if so, mostly as supporting evidence for the texts. Cf. idem, 124-125, n. 862. However, this study looks at iconographic images not just as illustrations of texts but tries to contribute towards the hermeneutics of iconographic research.</page><page sequence="5">Mapping the Literary to the Literal Image 209 j-^?&gt; Conceptual metaphor Metaphor: Iconographic Object: Heavenly Warrior Weather- and Warrior-god Ba 'al | Sub-metaphor j &lt;^"!";"".'"'"&gt; | Iconographic element j | Sub-metaphor j &lt;^ZZ''Z.&gt; | Iconographic element j | Sub-metaphor j &lt;J!"I"L";;!.&gt; | Iconographic element j Figure 1 Mapping the literal to the literary image 2. The Semantics of the Heavenly Warrior Metaphor in the Hebrew Psalter When it comes to the study of metaphors of God in the Hebrew Psalter, there exist few studies with a systematic approach to metaphor, although the He brew Psalter is probably one of the most metaphorically saturated books of the OT, and metaphor, according to Berlin, is almost intrinsic to parallelism as the strongest expression of Hebrew poetry.13 A survey of metaphors in the 13 Cf.

Klingbeil Hebrew Psalter which maps metaphors of the divine, and especially the heav enly warrior metaphor, throughout this body of texts shows an interesting distribution of the particular metaphor. However, before the result of the sur vey is presented, the concept of metaphor versus sub-metaphor needs to be addressed. 2.1 Metaphor and Sub-metaphors The expression 'metaphor mapping' is taken from Brettler who proposes a project for a systematic collection and interpretation of metaphors of God in the Hebrew Bible.14 He suggests a hierarchy of four root metaphors: mas ter and king for the socio-political sphere, and parent and husband for the familial sphere. These would then further be divided into their respective sub metaphors. While the question of root metaphor(s) has been amply discussed and criticized,15 a hierarchical organization of metaphors and corresponding sub-metaphors has the merit of showing the metaphorical structuring that forms the cognitive basis of the imagery. This is by far not only taxonomic, but also provides a key for the interpretation of the metaphor, since understand ing the main metaphor will be helpful in deciphering a given sub-metaphor and vice versa.16 Furthermore, within a framework of pragmatic research, it also demonstrates the communication strategies of the poets who employed recurring metaphors in the changing historical and cultural contexts.17 2.2 Survey and analysis A survey of metaphors of God as a Heavenly Warrior in the Hebrew Psalter needs to take certain limitations into considerations. Firstly, it has to be stressed that metaphors at times form clusters, i.e., different metaphors are used in very 14 Mark Z. Brettler, "The Metaphorical Mapping of God in the Hebrew Bible," in Metaphor, Canon and Community. Jewish, Christian and Islamic Approaches (ed. Ralph Bisschops and James Francis; Religions and Discourse 1; Bern/Berlin/Frankfurt a.M./New York/Paris/Wien: Peter Lang, 1999), 219-232. 15 Cf, for example, Stienstra's critique of Brettler's study of the king metaphor which is mainly directed towards his lack of pragmatic criteria, ignoring the changing meaning of human kingship within different cultural contexts from biblical to modern times. Nelly Stienstra, YHWH is the Husband of His People (Kampen: Kok Pharos, 1993), 68. Cf. also Klingbeil, Yahweh Fighting From Heaven, 26-27. Nevertheless, Brettler appears to have recognized the shortcoming of such a reductionist approach: "In an earlier study, I automatically subsumed all such instances of'judge' or'shepherd' under king, but I now see that this is flawed." Brettler, "Metaphorical Mapping of God," 227. 16 Klingbeil, Yahweh Fighting from Heaven, 11. The notion that metaphors have associated sub metaphors is derived from Brettler whose article on the warrior metaphor in the Psalms gave an important impetus for my study. 17 Cf. footnote 7.</page><page sequence="7">Mapping the Literary to the Literal Image 211 close proximity to each other, often overlapping each other.18 It is therefore sometimes rather difficult to isolate the various metaphors correctly. Due to that fact, the following survey19 will appear to a certain extent synthetic, and a number of occurrences could possibly be classified as presenting more than just the Heavenly Warrior metaphor. This takes into consideration the intricate literary relationships between different metaphors.20 This point can be further illustrated by the focus on the Heavenly Warrior metaphor in the present paper. Initially, I had categorized the metaphor as two individual metaphors, i.e., the God of heaven and the warrior metaphor.21 However, in revising the associated sub-metaphors it became obvious that both draw from one single metaphor as presented here. Secondly, a survey of metaphors cannot be approached with the help of a concordance search "since metaphors may be invoked implicitly rather than explicitly".22 As such, a much broader reading of the texts needs to take place that is informed and guided by an understanding of metaphor theory, in order to identify the respective metaphors. The sub-metaphors constituting the Heavenly Warrior metaphor type have been further categorized into attributes, position and constellation. Attributes are characteristic permanent features of the deity like shield, weapon, etc.; position refers to the physical pose the deity is engaged in, whereas constellation would refer to the combination of textual elements which expresses dynamic aspects of the imagery, creating narrative contexts.23 These categories have been chosen to group the sub-metaphors in approximation to terminology used in the interpretation of iconographic objects especially with regard to the pictorial representation of deities in the ANE.24 "Wer eine Sprache verstehen will, muss deren Syntax kennen und Satze analysieren; wer Bilder verstehen 18 Cf. for example Psa 23 which seems to present the metaphor of God as the shepherd. Note, however, that in vs. 5 suddenly the imagery changes and the metaphor of God as a host becomes dominant, without excluding the continuance of the shepherd metaphor. 19 The table is based on a survey of the Hebrew Psalter, published in a synoptic form in Kling beil, Yahweh Fighting from Heaven, 29-33. Space constraints do not permit to reproduce the survey here in its entirety. During the survey the metaphors were classified according to main metaphor, its respective sub-metaphor, metaphor type (i.e., substitutionary, interactive, or or namental) and metaphor category (i.e., anthropomorphic, theriomorphic, or physiomorphic). 20 E.g. Ps 11:4-6 which was identified as belonging to the God of heaven metaphor although vs. 5 could actually be part of the judge metaphor. 21 Klingbeil, Yahweh Fighting from Heaven, 37. 22 Brettler, "Metaphorical Mapping of God," 226. 23 The differentiation between attributes and position is somewhat artificial since the position may also add attributes to the imagery. 24 Cornelius in his study of Reshef and Ba'al focuses in his iconographic interpretation on motifs, positions, and attributes. Cf. Cornelius, Reshef and Ba'al, 242-253. See also Keel and Uehlinger's definition of constellation based on Assmann's comparison of text - in this case myth - and icon.

Klingbeil Figure 2 Stela from Ras Shamra (Ugarit) will, muss das Hauptaugenmerk auf komplexe Konstellationen richten, wo immer solche zu finden sind."25 One could argue at this point that a major difference between metaphor and iconographic object - and thus an obstacle for the purpose of this study - lies in the fact that the literary image is able to express the dynamic while the literal image is static in itself, unable to express action. However, I would argue that both metaphor and iconographic object have dynamic and static dimensions that are communicated through the differing media.26 The famous 'Baal au foudre figure from Ras Shamra portrays a seemingly frozen snapshot of the god with the raised club ready to strike which has been isolated from its context (no enemy is visible) and has thus been reduced to a symbolic menacing gesture.27 It nevertheless expresses and evokes the implied action (although not depicted) of the god striking the head of the enemy. The sub-metaphors within their categories are ordered according to their frequency of occurrence throughout the Hebrew Psalter. 25 Ibid., 14. 26 Cf. also the paper read at the 2008 SBL session in the Ritual in the Biblical World consultation: Gerald A. Klingbeil and Martin G. Klingbeil, '"Mirrors of the Dance': Finding the Interplay between the Static and the Dynamic in Biblical Ritual and ANE Iconography" (paper presented at the Annual Congress of the SBL, Boston, Mass., 23-25 November 2008). The authors ar gue with reference to the literary genre of ritual texts in the Hebrew Bible that, while both biblical ritual texts and ANE iconographic objects depicting religious/ritual activities describe a dynamic, action-oriented reality, both are in fact static snapshots of an ancient reality or concept. 27 Cf. Cornelius who suggests that the gesture alone is sufficient to transmit the message of power.

Beyond that Yahweh remains the deus ab sconditus surrounded by clouds and darkness, but also light, and his attributes</page><page sequence="11">Mapping the Literary to the Literal Image 215 are more peripheral than in direct reference to his bodily appearance.28 How ever, the shield is a frequent (6 times) and widely used (5 psalms) sub-metaphor and forms the only attribute that can be directly linked to Yahweh's bodily ap pearance. The position sub-metaphors of the Heavenly Warrior again relate to the theo phany in creating the spatial dimension from above towards below ("looking down," "riding through the heavens," "sitting enthroned above flood," etc.), although there is also movement into the opposite direction ("ascending to the height"). Aside from the shield, additional attributes are added through the position such as the cherubim throne, bow and arrows, spears, meteorological weapons in the form of lightning, etc., whereas the emphasis is on an active and aggressive posture, brandishing various weapons. However, the repeated emphasis on the sitting position distances the deity from its activities whereas the actions become almost emblematic. The constellations of the imagery depict the engagement of Yahweh with mainly two entities: humankind and nature. A number of sub-metaphors are dedicated to the theophanic event ("bowing the heavens", "coming down," etc.) whereas the utterance of Yahweh's voice becomes instrumental in the theophany. Yahweh s destructive actions are directed mainly against the en emies ("breaking enemies' teeth," "destroying enemies," "shattering enemies' heads," etc.) but also against nature ("breaking cedars of Lebanon," "shaking the wilderness"). However, towards nature the Heavenly Warrior is also positive disposed ("firmly establishing the earth," "establishing mountains," "making morning/evening rejoice," etc.) which emphasizes the unexpected aspect of the metaphor. As much as the Heavenly Warrior destroys the enemies, he also destroys weapons, makes wars cease, and provides people with grain and water. 3. The Semantics of the Storm- and Warrior-god Ba'al in ANE iconography As iconographic counterpart to the Heavenly Warrior metaphor in the Hebrew Psalter I will focus on the Syro-Palestinian storm- and warrior-god Ba'al.29 This 28 There is, of course, another important and frequently metaphor in the Hebrew Psalter, i.e., the metaphor of God's body. However, one has to take into consideration that the anthropomorphic depiction of God is a prevalent literary device in biblical writing, while the various sub metaphors of this imagery often take on almost literal character, departing from the original metaphorical objectives. In addition to this fact, the various sub-metaphors of the God's body metaphor are not clustered in meaning as is the case with other metaphors. Cf. Klingbeil, Yahweh Fighting From Heaven, 34. 29 I will draw on various synthetic studies such as: Schwemer, Wettergottgestalten; Cornelius, Reshef and Ba'al; Klingbeil, Yahweh Fighting From Heaven; Keel and Uehlinger, Gottinnen. In this connection one also needs to mention Green's synthetic study which tries to sketch the overall history of the ANE storm-god based on the textual and iconographic data.

Klingbeil includes also local adaptation of the deity, such as Ba'al-Hadad, Ba'al-Zaphon, Ba'al-Seth whereas the emphasis is not so much on the identification30 of the god but on the semantics of his iconographic description as it can be related to the semantic description of metaphors provided above. I will apply the same format as in the previous section in order to be able to facilitate the necessary platform for comparison.31 The most comprehensive iconographic study to date on Ba'al (and Reshef) remains Cornelius' The Iconography of the Canaanite Gods Reshef and Ba'al: Late Bronze and Iron Age I Periods in which he studies ca. 200 objects from various iconographic media (stelae, reliefs, bronze figurines, and seals) repre senting both deities. While a number of ANE gods can be categorized as storm-gods,32 in north ern Syria, Hadad (Hadda/u) emerged as a local adaptation of the Mesopo tamian storm-god Adad from the middle of the second millennium BCE. His attributes are clearly cosmic and warlike, connecting him with the Mesopota mian storm-god. Along the Syro-Palestinian coastline the epithet of the storm god Ba'lu (Ba'al) was established as the proper name of the Syrian storm-god R. W. Green, The Storm-god in the Ancient Near East (Biblical and Judaic Studies 8; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2003). Unfortunately, the iconographic data provided by Green is rather outdated and his interpretation of it sometimes flawed. See my critique of Green: Martin G. Klingbeil, review of A. R. W. Green, The Storm-God in the Ancient Near East, Andrews University Seminary Studies 43 (2005): 341-345. Furthermore, Schwemer has recently published a two part article in which he provides a synthesis of his earlier Wettergottgestalten and also critically evaluates Green's methodology with regard to philology and the interpretation of texts. Daniel Schwemer, "The Storm-Gods of the Ancient Near East: Summary, Synthesis, Recent Studies, Part I" Journal of Ancient Near Eastern Religions 7.2 (2008), 121-168; and idem, "The Storm Gods of the Ancient Near East: Summary, Synthesis, Recent Studies, Part I" Journal of Ancient Near Eastern Religions 8.1 (2008), 1-44. For a summary of studies on the iconography of Ba'al and Reshef, see Cornelius, Reshef and Ba'al, 4-11. 30 Scholars have long noted the multiplicity of names that could have been ascribed to one type of deity in the ANE depending on geographical and cultural boundaries. The following synthetic statement by Schwemer may be taken as representative: "The manifold contacts between the regions and cultures of the ancient Near East also led to the proximity and co existence of different polytheistic systems and thus to identifications and syncretisms between typologically similar deities with different names. Conversely local forms of the same god could be worshipped under various different names or epithets within one cultural context. Most ancient Near Eastern deities can therefore not be considered in isolation, but need investigation within the realms of a typologically coherent group." Schwemer, "Storm-Gods I," 124. 31 Cornelius applies similar categories in his study on Reshef and Ba'al: position, attributes and typology. Cornelius, Reshef and Ba'al, 245-263. 32 Cf. Schwemer on the limitations of typologies: "The definition of such a group should take its starting point from a manifestation of the particular type of god that is well documented in text and image, whose modus operandi, profile and basic functions serve as basis for the definition of the type; in the case of storm-gods the Assyro-Babylonian Adad would be the obvious starting-point. All those deities considered to be typologically related with the god chosen as starting-point or with each other, in as far as this is attested by the evidence of ancient Near Eastern texts and images, are then to be included in the inquiry." Schwemer, "Storm-gods I," 124.</page><page sequence="13">Mapping the Literary to the Literal Image 217 and is attested especially well in epigraphic sources from Ugarit,33 showing Ba'al in his victorious battle against Yammu (the chaos serpent) and his sub sequent defeat by Motu (representing drought, sterility, and death) and sub sequent reappearance from the underworld as storm- and rain-giver, in this way stressing his central role in the seasonal cycle of fertility. According to the iconographic evidence, Ba'al was also introduced into Egypt during the Hyksos Period (1650-1550 BCE) and re-adapted into Syro-Palestine as Ba'al-Seth by the beginning of the Iron Age.34 In focusing on the iconographic evidence concerning the storm- and war rior-god Ba'al, the following table summarizes the iconographic semantics of the deity.

There are instances when anthropomorphic and theriomor phic elements are mixed such as the bull's head and the wings, but mostly the attributes limit themselves to anthropomorphisms. The positions of Ba'al are limited to three: he is always in a striding position indicating the dynamic character of his portrayal which in its constant repeti tion almost becomes an emblematic stance. He is either brandishing a weapon in his hand raised above his head, again through its repetition emblematic in character, or he is in an attacking position with the spear pointing downwards. The menacing position is usually without any contextual object which leads to the conclusion that the pose is sufficient to communicate the intended message of power.56 The constellations elaborate on the positions and show Ba'al as striding over mountains indicating his divine abode and holy mountain imagery. He furthermore appears with the lion or bull as pedestal indicating the dominion of the deity over nature and his affinity to procreative and military power. The same message is conveyed in the depiction of Ba'al as the monster slayer whereas the most common motif is found in the Egyptian Apophis serpent. "The serpent represents chaos and Ba'al, the bearer of life (and order), has to control these forces."57 4. Comparison and Conclusion Comparing the 'semantics' of the Heavenly Warrior as found in the Hebrew Psalter with the iconographic depiction of the storm- and warrior-god as epit omized in the Canaanite deity Ba'al, the following picture begins to emerge.58 The attributes of the Yahweh as the Heavenly Warrior as found in the Hebrew Psalter serve more to hide him than to reveal him and describe him more as the deus absconditus than any discernible form. This is in sharp contrast with the anthropomorphic character of the portrayal of the Ba'al as the storm- and warrior-god in ANE iconography. The positions in both cases are actively aggressive and menacing towards an enemy whereas in the case of Yahweh there is a strong emphasis on spatial dimensions from above towards below within the context of the theophanic event, while Ba'al is usually depicted within the human domain, except in the striding over mountains motif which is usually associated with Northern Syro-Palestinian contexts. 56 Cf. Cornelius, Reshef and Ba'al, 255. 57 Ibid., 263. 58 One has to note that this comparison has deliberately not taken into consideration the numer ous literary sources that describe Ba'al, such as the texts from Ras Shamra/Ugarit. For a short summary of Ba'al at Ugarit, cf. Schwemer, "Storm-gods II," 8-14.</page><page sequence="18">222 Martin G. Klingbeil In terms of the constellations, the imagery of Ba'al consistently tries to com municate power over nature and humankind through aggressive dominion, whereas Yahweh destroys the enemies as well, but unexpectedly reverses the pattern by establishing nature and pacifying humankind. The Canaanite storm- and warrior-god Ba'al is one of the most frequently mentioned non-Israelite deities in the Hebrew Bible59 and his relationship with Yahweh is sometimes too easily established in terms of an evolutionary dependence whereas the direction assumed is generally from Ba'al towards Yahweh.60 This can lead to interpretations of biblical texts that presuppose a transferral of attributes from Ba'al to Yahweh.61 However, the semantic mapping between literary and literal image as at tempted in this study, illustrates that the two deities, to speak metaphorically, might not be siblings (nor father and son) and that any comparative interpre tations should be accompanied by an analysis which takes into consideration the deeper levels of connections between imagery and image. 59 Ba'al as personal name and in reference to a Canaanite deity appears about 80 times in the Old Testament. 60 For example: "Yahweh was initially a god acting mainly in the realm of history. Owing to his growing place in Israelite religion, his sphere of influence gradually widened to eventually include what had once been the domain of Baal as well. His rise in importance was only possible, in fact, through his incorporation of traits that had formerly been characteristic of Baal only." Herrmann, "Baal," 138. 61 As in the case of the interpretations of Psa 29 as "an Israelite adaptation of a Canaanite hymnus to Ba'al" or Psa 65 as an old rain-hymnus to Ba'al.
