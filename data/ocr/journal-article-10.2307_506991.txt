Said to come from Luristan in western Iran, these objects excited fierce speculation as to their date and iconography. Over the following decade, attempts were made through excavation to verify the trav- ellers' and dealers' reports. The results confirmed an early first millennium B.C. date for many of the objects, yet typo- logical studies suggested that others dated as early as the third millennium. This triggered further debate on the chro- nology and possible ethnic origins of the makers, opinions being broadly divided as to whether those responsible were late Kassite immigrants or Cimmerian mercenaries of the Assyrian army. Archaeological investigations by Danish and British ex- peditions during the 1960s added important new informa- tion, proving the existence of dense Iron Age settlement patterns both within the plains and the eastern highlands of Luristan, and the contemporaneity of classic "Luristan Bronzes" and so-called "Genre Luristan" painted pottery. However, possibly the most important contribution to our understanding of the cultural sequence within Luristan was made by Louis Vanden Berghe, director of the Belgian Archaeological Mission in Iran. From 1965 to 1979 Vanden Berghe discovered a num- ber of cemeteries spanning the Chalcolithic to Iron Age periods in the Pusht-i Kuh region of western Luristan. The results rapidly confirmed reports as early as 1932/33 that cemeteries rather than settlements were the main source of "Luristan Bronzes." Vanden Berghe issued regular pre- liminary reports and popular articles, but died in 1993 be- fore seeing any of his results published in the form of final reports. This task has now been undertaken by Professor E. Haerinck (Gent University) and his colleagues. Chamahzi Mumah is the second such report, the first be-</page><page sequence="2">556 BOOK REVIEWS [AJA 103 ing on two fifth-millennium cemeteries (E. Haerinck and B. Overlaet, The Chalcolithic Period: Parchinah and Hakalan [Brussels 1996]). Chamahzi Mumah is a small eighth-century (Iron III) cemetery located near the bank of a small river. Eighty-one tombs were excavated, following the chance discovery of the site in 1974; overlying gravel and sand deposits had for- tunately prevented earlier robbing. The importance of the site lies in its funerary architecture and undisturbed grave groups, which are published in detail, illustrated with good- quality photographs and clear drawings by E. Smekens, and discussed according to main categories of material. The poor preservation of the skeletal remains prevented analysis of possible spatial patterning according to age or gender. The graves comprised rectangular, stone-lined and roofed cists constructed at the base of larger oval cuts that were surrounded by a low ring-wall with one or more head- stones at the end. Objects were found in over 90% of the graves. The principal categories were vessels, weapons, and jewellery. Containers were most frequent, of which local buffware and lightly burnished grayware ceramics predom- inated. These consisted mainly of small- or medium-sized bowls, lugged vases, jars with one or two handles, and "tea- pots"; a small number of double- and triple-joined jars were also found. Decoration was sparse and limited to low knobs, impressed dots, and incised lines; painted "Genre Luristan" pottery was absent, suggesting that this class was restricted to eastern Luristan. Low horizontal ridging, found on several small grayware jars, recalls ribbing on certain sheet-bronze jars found here and elsewhere in Luristan. Hammered sheet-bronze bowls and jars were common, occurring in as many as 37% of the graves, although most graves con- tained only a single metal vessel. Other vessels comprised a small glazed vase, a bronze wine-strainer, a limestone pyxis, a modified ostrich egg, and a straight-sided bronze bucket with a loop handle and Assyrian-style decoration. Buckets such as this are frequently depicted in ninth- eighth century Assyrian art, and several plain examples were excavated at Hasanlu, in north-west Iran, yet this is the first archaeological evidence for this type in Luristan. A variety of short- and long-distance weapons were rep- resented in almost half of the graves, including chipped stone, iron and bronze arrowheads, cast bronze mace- heads, iron shaft-hole axes, a bronze axe-adze decorated with a bearded face, iron swords with riveted pommels and bronze grips, daggers, knives, and circular bronze shield bosses. Interestingly, spearheads, which occur in other Iron III cemetery contexts, were absent at Chamahzi Mu- mah. The poor condition of the iron blades, all of which "pulverized when they were extracted from the earth" (18), explains the disproportionately low number of such weapons on the art market. The jewellery was simple and functional, with no evi- dence for extravagant wealth. Metal objects included silver earrings with granulated drops, silver and bronze rings and bracelets with plain terminals, and bronze anklets, with as many as 13 in one grave; the popularity of heavy an- klets is graphically illustrated by the discovery at the con- temporary site of Baba Jan of an anthropomorphic ceramic figure wearing three anklets on one leg (C. Goff, "Excava- tions at Baba Jan: The Pottery and Metal from Levels III and II," Iran 16 [1978] 38, 55, fig. 13:2). Beads were made of silver, bronze, carnelian, agate, unidentified stone, glass paste, frit, and ceramic. Finally, a small number of pierced lambis-shell discs were also found in association with beads, suggesting that the function of these distinctive objects was decorative. Chamahzi Mumah provides a useful archaeological glimpse into Iron III Luristan. The closest excavated paral- lels lie within the Pusht-i Kuh, particularly from Vanden Berghe's excavations of a cemetery at War Kabud, the sub- ject of a forthcoming volume. Connections with highland Iran or Susiana are absent, as are close parallels with east- ern Luristan; the scarcity of canonical "Luristan Bronzes" underlines the cultural heterogeneity of Early Iron Age Iran. In contrast, Assyrian parallels for some of the objects suggests that there was close interaction between western Luristan and Mesopotamia during this period. This pic- ture is supported by a growing body of evidence from other sites in western Iran (reviewed in J. Curtis ed., Later Mesopotamia and Iran: Tribes and Empires 1600-539 B.C. [London 1995]). Regular Assyrian campaigns into this re- gion during the ninth and eighth centuries B.C. indicate that these relations were not entirely amicable, although the political loyalties of those individuals interred at Chamahzi Mumah remains ambiguous.
