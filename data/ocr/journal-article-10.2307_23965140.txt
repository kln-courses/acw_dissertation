<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS IN GENESIS I The scholarly discussion of the Priestly creation story (Gen. 1: ι ι -2,4a) has been clouded by imprecise claims about the intentions of its author(s). Hypotheses have tended to range over a number of quite different aspects of P's intentions. There is, perhaps, no reason why there should not be a broad, umbrella concept of authorial intention, but a number of exegetical disputes can be attributed to a failure to recognize the different facets of P's intention. My main concern here is not so much to arbitrate between competing exegetical conclusions as to deal with the prior task of analysing the nature of these diverse conclusions. An analyt ical study of this kind will hopefully provide a framework within which competing arguments about authorial intention may be considered. The paper will, first, attempt to distinguish between motives and communicative intentions, secondly, investigate the problem of indirect communicative intentions, and thirdly, exam ine the extent to which genre is part of communicative intention. Although the main focus of our discussion will be intentionality, we need to begin by recognizing that a concern with P's intention has not always been the primary interest of studies on Gen. 1. Indeed, Hermann Gunkel's influential work Schopfung und Chaos in in Urzeit und Endzeit (1895) set out to show that Gen. 1 contains traces of ideas that Ρ could not have intended. The burden of Gunkel's study was to show that the text contained a great deal of traditional material, and that it was not therefore the free construction of its author.1 In order to draw this distinction between traditional material and authorial intention, Gunkel focused on vestiges of ideas that were inconsistent with Priestly 1 Gunkel attributes to Wellhausen the view 'dass Gen. 1 eine freie "Construe tion" des exilischen Verfassers sei' (Schopfung und Chaos in Urzeit und EndzeitEndzeit (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1895), p. 4). Note, however, that only the word 'Construction' is directly quoted from Wellhausen (the reference is to the 3rd edn. of his Prolegomena), and Wellhausen's own adjective is actually 'systemati sche', not 'freie'. Gunkel's paraphrase is puzzling since he himself later refers to Wellhausen's view that Ρ edited an earlier source Q (see below n. 2), which is surely not a matter of free construction. For the phrase 'systematische Construe tion' see J. Wellhausen, Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels, 2nd edn. (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1883) = ET Prolegomena to the History of Israel (Edinburgh: A. &amp; C. Black, 1885), 298.

BRETT theology. Thus, for example, Gunkel rejected Wellhausen's idea that Ρ edited a source document Q in such a way as to add the sabbath on the seventh day of the creation story.2 Gunkel found this inconceivable as an innovation of P; Priestly theology was elsewhere never so anthropomorphic as to suppose that God would actually need to rest. Gunkel's proposal at this point is character istic: if Ρ did not introduce the sabbath rest, then it must have been passed down by a long tradition, and the origins of this tradition were entirely lost on the Priestly writer. To take another example, Gunkel understood the anarthrous word t'hom ('deep') in Gen. 1: 2 to be the Hebrew equivalent of the Akkadian name for the Babylonian goddess Tiamat, but he suggested that this connection was no longer understood by P.3 For Gunkel, this only demonstrated once again that biblical critics need to distinguish between traditional material and authorial intention. This kind of argument can be found in much of the research that has followed in the wake of Schopfung und Chaos, even where Gunkel is being explicitly contradicted. It is often said that there are 'vestiges' in Gen. 1 of earlier tradition, and it is frequently left unclear how these traces relate to P's own intentions. Thus, for example, in his recent study God's Conflict with the Dragon and the the Sea (1985) John Day follows Heidel and Schmidt in asserting that t'hom cannot be derived from Tiamat, but rather, both words derive from a common Semitic root. The mythological back ground of t'hom is Canaanite, not Babylonian, according to Day. Nevertheless, Day argues that the reason t'hom almost always lacks a definite article is that it is 'a remnant of the time long past when the term did denote a mythical personality',4 although it no longer does so in Gen. 1: 2. What is Day really saying here? The logic of his argument does seem to require that interpreters ought to distinguish, as did Gunkel, between vestiges of traditional material and the Priestly author's own intention. A number of critics have, however, been clear in rejecting the idea that an author's material might reflect unassimilated frag ments of earlier traditions. Wellhausen's response to Schopfung 22 Q was Weilhausen's abbreviation for the 'book of the four convenants' (quat uor),uor), a collection of texts which earlier critics had referred to as the 'Grundschrift'. On Gen. 1 see Die Composition des Hexateuchs 4th edn. (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1963), 184-6. Gunkel refers to the 2nd edn. of Weilhausen's Composition ((Berlin: G. Reimer, 1885), p. 188) in Schopfung und Chaos, p. 13 n. 3. 5 See Gunkel, Schopfung, 7, 13-14; Genesis 7th edn. (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1966), 103, 115.

Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), 50.</page><page sequence="3">MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS IN GENESIS I 3 undund Chaos is worth noting in this context. He conceded that it might be interesting to know, for antiquarian reasons, that the biblical authors were often handling material which was an opaque residue of previous ages. But as far as exegesis was concerned, Wellhausen insisted that if the earlier life of the material lay outside the consciousness of the author, then it was methodologic ally irrelevant.5 Wellhausen emerges from this debate with Gunkel as a defender of the integrity of authors; if the meaning was not perspicuous to the author then it was no meaning at all. Gunkel's point was precisely the opposite: exegesis needed to track down these traces of earlier traditions, even if this under mined the coherence of an author's intention. If the origins of a tradition were opaque to the author, then this was just one more argument for investigating the history of traditions. He suggested that there was a whole series of mythological echoes in Gen. 1: the idea of a creative 'spirit of God', darkness and water at the beginning of the world, the lights of the heavens as 'rulers', the implication of a divine council, among others. In effect, Gunkel's tradition criticism advocated the investigation of meanings which were no longer present in the author's mind. In this respect one might even say that his exegesis foreshadows the concerns of recent deconstructionist critics. Along with these critics, Gunkel can conceive of textual meanings (or 'intertextuaP meanings)5 that s The following passage is representative of Wellhausen's disposition towards Gunkel's work: 'Das Proton Pseudos 1st, dass er der Ursprungsfrage iiberhaupt grossen Wert beimisst. Von methodischer Wichtigkeit ist es zu wissen, dass tats achlich ein Stoff in den Apokalypsen vorliegt, der von der Conception des Autors nicht immer vollig durchdrungen, in seinem Guss nicht immer ganz aufgeganen ist und noch ofter fiir unsere Erklarung einen undurchsichtigen Rest lasst; woher jedoch dieser Stoff urspriinglich stammt, ist methodisch ganz gleichgiltig (sic)'.

Wellhausen also added a note on thorn to his Prolegomena, insisting that it was not a Babylonian loanwoad, otherwise the feminine ending would have been retained. See the Prolegomena, 6th edn., 297. 6 Contrary to some uses of the word 'intertextuality' in recent biblical studies, J. Derrida and his followers use the term not merely to describe an intentional procedure of reading one text alongside another, but rather to indicate that all language (whether written or oral) is full of residues and traces of meaning that elude a speaker or author's conscious grasp. This is what makes deconstructionists critical of authorial intention as a regulative norm for literary criticism. See especially Derrida's influential work, Of Grammatology trans. G. C. Spivak (Balti more: John's Hopkins, 1976), 139, and J. Culler, On Deconstruction: Theory and Criticism Criticism after Structuralism (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1983), 128-9, 218-19. Gunkel's exegesis would suggest that the novelty of deconstruction has, to some extent, been overestimated; his reading of Gen. 1 effaces authorship in favour of intertextuality. But he does not lapse into overly general theories about indeterminate meanings or the heterogeneity of all texts. For this criticism of</page><page sequence="4">4 MARK G. BRETT are deferred from an elusive past and absent from an author's consciousness. The echoes of past meaning provoke tensions and contradictions in the text of which the author seems unaware. But whether or not we think of Gunkel's work on Gen. 1 as decon structionist, we should not be surprised that Gunkel and Wellhausen came to such different exegetical conclusions; they were not always pursuing the same interpretative goals. In short, it would be unwise to assume that authorial intention is the only legitimate goal of exegetical study; this would be too doctrinaire. Even if one disagrees with Gunkel's conclusions on Gen. 1, it should be clear that his interpretative interest in tradi tional material is logically separable from Wellhausen's interest in authorial intention.7 A study of tradition might well illuminate an author's intention, but that is a different issue. Tradition and intention represent two different goals of interpretation, and the precise relationship between them can only be determined case by case. We shall return to this issue when we consider the interpret ation of the image of God in Gen. 1: 26-8. Given that tradition and intention need to be separated, we can now turn our attention to the issue of intentionality. I.I. Motives and Communicative Intentions What do interpreters mean when they say that they are investi gating the intentions embodied in Gen. 1 ? The complexity of inten tionality is, for example, hinted at by David Clines at the beginning of his paper 'Theme in Genesis 1—11' (1976). Clines maintains that an author's intention may be 'to influence a particu lar historical situation (e.g. of controversy), or to meet a psycholo gical need on the author's part, or even to make money or gain prestige'.8 This argument is, in itself, incontrovertible. But Clines uses it, along with other considerations, to marginalize the relev ance of authorial intention to the rest of his paper. It is his deconstruction see F. Lentricchia, After the New Criticism (London: Methuen, 1983), 182-4. 7 In more technical vocabulary, one could say that understanding authorial intentions is one of the tasks of synchronic emics, whereas understanding traditions is one of the tasks of diachronic emics. See further M. G. Brett, 'Four or Five Things to do with Texts: A Taxonomy of Interpretative Interests' in: The Bible in in Three Dimensions, eds. D. Clines, S. Fowl and S. Porter (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1990), 357-77. This article sets out a pluralist account of biblical studies, locating intentionalist criticism within the broader framework of emic social science. For a fuller discussion of pluralism, see Brett, Biblical Criticism in Crisis?Crisis? The Impact of the Canonical Approach on Old Testament Studies (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, forthcoming). 8 D. J. A. Clines, 'Theme in Genesis 1-11' CBQ 38 (1976), 484.</page><page sequence="5">MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS IN GENESIS I 5 particular use of the argument which may be questioned. Follow ing Gunkel, I have already suggested that exegesis need not be intentionalist, but I would also want to argue that the complexity of authorial intention is not a sufficient reason for disposing of it as an interpretative goal. What is needed is a more detailed analysis of intentionality. At the most basic level of analysis, we need to distinguish between communicative intentions and motives. These are separ ate interpretative goals. That is to say, one ought to distinguish between what an author is trying to say (which might be called a 'communicative intention') and why it is being said (which might be called a 'motive').9 As Clines has pointed out, any given author could be driven to write by the desire for prestige or by some psychological need, but I would want to argue that these examples apply only to the level of motives. It is important to make this distinction between motives and communicative intentions since even if one was certain that a work was motivated by, say, a desire for prestige, this in no way resolves the question of what was being said. Any single motive can give rise to a vast range of quite different communicative intentions. Think, for example, of desires to enlighten or to amuse. In order to answer the question of what an author is trying to say (a communicative intention) one needs to attend to the language and genre of a text in its historical situation. In order to answer the question of why something is being said (a motive), semantics and literary criticism are no longer enough; motives lie behind and are prior to communicative inten tions. Motives may not come to explicit expression at all.10 Given the distinction between motives and communicative intentions we are now in a position to examine more closely how it can be fruitfully applied to studies of the Priestly creation story and to the comparative material with which it has been associated. S. G. F. Brandon's paper on 'The Propaganda Factor in some Ancient Near Eastern Cosmogonies' (1963) is an appropriate place to begin, since it deals precisely with the motive of gaining pres tige. In this article, Brandon argues that many ancient cosmog onies were not simply the product of speculation on the origins of the universe; rather, they were designed primarily to enhance 9 Cf. Q. Skinner, 'Motives, Intentions, and the Interpretation of Texts' New Literary Literary History, 3 (1972), 393-408. Skinner, a political historian, here applies some of the more general philosophical discussion of intentionality to the inter pretation of texts. 10 The most extreme case would be lying. See, e.g., E. D. Hirsch's discussion of this issue in Validity in Interpretation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1967). 55·</page><page sequence="6">6 MARK G. BRETT the prestige of a particular sanctuary. These cosmogonies are best understood as propaganda. I would suggest that this kind of interpretation is aimed at understanding the motive behind the cosmogonies, and not their communicative intentions as such. Brandon did not discover the propaganda factor by grasping the verbal meaning of, for example, a single Egyptian cosmogony in itself. Rather, he grasped it by illuminating the wider historical contexts of, for example, the competing cosmogonies of Memphis and Heliopolis. The communicative intention of the individual texts was discerned by examining their language and genre, but the underlying motive of the Memphite theology was not so explicit. A similar point could be made concerning Brandon's suggestion that the Priestly creation story in Genesis also contains a dominant propaganda motive, namely, a concern for the proper observance of the sabbath.11 Clearly, Gen. 2: 2-3 does not actually prescribe the observance of the sabbath; it simply recounts the origin of the first sabbath without even directly naming it a 'sabbath'. There may well be, as Brandon suggested, a prescriptive motive underly ing the text, but at the level of communicative intention it only describes or reports a divine rest on the seventh day of creation. What the text actually says needs to be distinguished from infer ences based on a wider context of historical evidence. This is not to reject Brandon's suggestion; I am simply trying to categorize it in terms of the proposed analytical distinction between motives and communicative intentions. Biblical scholars often shift their focus between these two layers of intentionality without actually recognizing that they are doing so. There are, indeed, a number of studies which, like Brandon's essay, have put forward what amount to hypotheses concerning the motives behind the Priestly creation story, and it may be helpful at this point briefly to review some of them. In a paper entitled 'The Mythological Features in Genesis Chapter 1 and the Author's Intentions' (1974) A. S. Kapelrud goes a step beyond Brandon in suggesting that P's creation story reflects the importance of the sabbath in the exile and its function there of marking out a special religious and national group. Sab bath observance was a way of dividing this group off from the surrounding peoples, and the concern for social distinction was 'expressed in a verb frequently used by Ρ in Gen. 1, hibdil, to 11 S. G. F. Brandon, 'The Propaganda Factor in Some Ancient Near Eastern Cosmogonies' in: Promise and Fulfilment, ed. F. F. Bruce (Edinburgh: Τ. &amp; T. Clarke, 1963), 33.</page><page sequence="7">MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS IN GENESIS I 7 divide'.divide'.12 Kapelrud seems to be saying that the divisions in the creation story are really about social relations, but once again, one ought not to conflate two different kinds of claim. At the level of communicative intention, the narration of the first sabbath has nothing to do with social division, and indeed, the verb hibdil does not even occur in the report of the divine rest in 2: 2—3. But Kapelrud has considered a broader range of historical evidence and arrived at a motive for why the Priestly creation story is narrated in this particular way. The needs of the exile have shaped P's motives, and these have surfaced only indirectly in the text itself. Claus Westermann, on the other hand, seems to exclude the narrower socio-religious motive suggested by Kapelrud. In his commentary on Genesis, Westermann thinks it significant that the Ρ document, with its centre formed by exclusivist cultic law, should begin with the creation of the cosmos and of humankind as a whole. Ρ begins, he insists, with a universalist thrust, rather than with a focus on the particular covenant with Israel. The solemn seventh day is a holy period of time with ,a strongly universal character' that 'cannot be determined by or limited to Israel's Sabbath'. He is willing to concede that only vv. 2b and 3b, which contain the catchword 'rest', reflect and point to 'the later founding of the Sabbath'.13 Whatever the merits of Westermann's argument, it is important to see that it is focused on the level of communicative intention and not on the level of motive. I would suggest that there is no direct conflict with Kapelrud's account of the divine rest. What seems universalistic on the communicative surface might still be driven by a deeper and more exclusivist motive. (On Kapelrud's side one could also cite the view of Ralph Klein: 'P's emphasis on Sabbath in the creation story is part of an attempt to preserve Israel's Israel's identity by linking Sabbath to creation and by grounding its observance in an imitation of God').14 In order to appreciate fully the compatibility of Westermann's universalistic position with Kapelrud's particularist focus, it may be useful to consider the wider context of Westermann's argument. His discussion of the pre-history of the creation story encom passes, I would suggest, both motives and communicative inten tions without drawing a proper distinction between the two. He 12 A. S.

BRETT argues, for example, that creation myths did not originally arise as answers to purely intellectual questions about the origins of the world. On the contrary, their 'original function' in cultic celebra tions was to 'maintain and secure the present state of the world and of life'. This original 'function and meaning' was gradually lost, however, when the stories were taken from their original cultic setting and transformed into explanations of the origin of the world. The creation narrative handed down to us in Gen. 1 has a new 'function', he suggests, as the introduction the whole Priestly work. It has the character of a universalistic overture to the series of events that form the basis of the more particular covenant with Israel.15 Here Westermann has used the word 'function' to equivocate between motive and communicative intention. The function of maintaining and securing the present state of the world actually represents a motive. Such a motive could give rise to a vast range of creation stories, and indeed, Westermann follows R. Pettazzoni in undermining even the distinction between stories of creation by personal divinities on the one hand and stories of spontaneous origin on the other. The primary function of myth to maintain the stability of the present world is said to render such a distinction 'secondary'.16 But at the level of communicative intention such a distinction is by no means secondary; it is precisely what makes the one set of stories different to the other. Accordingly, I would argue that Westermann has not succeeded in accounting for a historical change in the function of the creation story; he is actually talking about two different kinds of function, one relating to motives and the other relating to communicative intentions. It may well be the case that the motive behind P's creation story was not, in fact, to maintain the security of the world, but that does not exclude the possibility that some other motive was at work. In order to suggest that exilic sabbath observ ance was a key motivating factor behind Gen. 1, Kapelrud and Klein do not need to deny that at the more explicit level of communicative intention the text forms a universalistic 'overture' to the rest of the Priestly work. Kapelrud and Klein are attempting to penetrate below the explicit layer of the Priestly intention in order to focus instead on a motive that is relevant to P's historical context. The examples collected from Brandon, Kapelrud, Klein, and Westermann, show that biblical critics have often shifted focus between two different layers of intentionality without recognizing Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 92-3, cf. 21-2. " Ibid. 21.</page><page sequence="9">MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS IN GENESIS I 9 that they are doing so. It should be clear that this lack of discrim ination has led to some infelicitous disputes. But now it becomes necessary to deal with a notion that complicates the clear distinct ion between motives and communicative intentions that we have so far maintained, namely, the notion of indirect communication. II. Indirect Communication Where an author's communicative intention is conveyed only indirectly, it may seem difficult to distinguish this intention from a motive, but my argument here is that the distinction can still be shown to be valid. The first example of indirect communication that we shall con sider is provided by Norbert Lohfink's essay 'Die Priesterschrift und die Geschichte' (1978). This essay argues that the basic aim of the Priestly narrative as a whole was to engender, in the exilic community, a sense of hope. If the engendering of hope was indeed the basic aim of the Priestly narrative, then I suggest that we understood this aim as a motive. Moreover, this motive was not the exclusive preserve of P. Thus, Lohfink points out that in this respect P's intention was, for example, no different to that of Deutero-Isaiah: both 'intended' to engender hope.17 But what is meant here is not that Ρ and Deutero-Isaiah have the same com municative intention, but rather they have the same basic motive. Lohfink's point illustrates once again that a single motive can give rise to widely different communicative intentions. In order to engender hope, the prophetic oracles of Second Isaiah directly describe a glorious future—a new creation, a new exodus, and a return to Zion. At the explicit level of communicative intention, the Priestly narratives, on the other hand, are focused on the past. Characteristically, they contain only implied or paradigmatic messages of hope for the exiled community. Lohfink goes on to argue that P's message of hope for the exiles is not grounded in a prophetic eschatology, but rather, in a cyclical return to the fulfilment of God's purposes when the Israelites subdued the promised land. In focusing on the land Lohfink is developing the view of Karl Elliger and Walter Brueggemann that the real theme of the Priestly document is not to be found in the cult but in the promised land of Canaan.18 The scheme of promise and fulfilment begins not with the patriarchs but with creation, 17 Ν. Lohfink, 'Die Priesterschrift und die Geschichte' SVT 29 (1978), 216. 18 K. Elliger, 'Sinn und Ursprung der priesterschriftlichen Geschichtserzah lung' Z.Th.K. 49 (1952), 121-43; W. Brueggemann, 'The Kerygma of the Priestly Writers' ZAW 84 (1972), 397-413.</page><page sequence="10">10 MARK G. BRETT and among the pillars of this argument is a particular interpreta tion of Gen. 1: 28. Here, in the blessing of humankind, Lohfink finds a preliminary sketch of the whole chain of events narrated by P. The key verbs, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth', are repeated several times in the book of Genesis (Gen. 9: 1,7; 17: 2,6,16; 18: 3; 35: 9,11; 48: 3 f.; 47: 27) and once in Exodus (1:7). But Gen. 1: 28 also speaks of subduing the earth (w'kibhiha), and Lohfink is convinced that the reference to the land being 'subdued' (nikb'iah) in Jos. 18: 1 is part of the Priestly narrative and a fulfilment of the subduing of the earth in Gen. 1: 28. According to Lohfink, the narratives of the flood, Egyptian bond age, and the wilderness journey become paradigmatic for the exiled community: the exiles will regain the gift of the land once the sinful generation who caused the exile have died out. But this message of hope is communicated only indirectly through narrat ives about the past. Whatever one might think about Lohfink's hypothesis, and it has been criticized for several reasons, my primary concern here is to analyse the kind of authorial intention that is implied by it. Clearly, Lohfink is assuming that even given such an extensive work as the Priestly narrative, the author's real intention is con veyed only indirectly or by implication. This is indeed a regular feature of everyday conversation, and there is a recent branch of linguistics which is devoted to just this kind of indirect commun ication under the technical heading of 'conversational impli cature'.19 The term 'implicature' is used by linguists in order to draw attention to the frequent uncertainties of indirect commun ication—as opposed to the certainty of strict, logical implications. One therefore needs to recognize that communicative intentions can be layered in complex ways and possess different degrees of determinacy. Indeed, in their major work Relevance: Communica tion tion and Cognition (1986), Dan Sperber and Diedre Wilson have suggested that we should see a 'continuum of cases, from implicat ures which the hearer was specifically intended to recover to implicatures which were merely intended to be made manifest'.20 The language concerning the image of God in Gen. 1: 26-8 provides another example relating to this issue of indirect com 18 See, e.g., J.

One of the major contributions of recent research on these endlessly disputed verses is that the notion of a divine image in the ancient Near East was almost invariably associated with kingship. Especially following the detailed research of Werner Schmidt and Hans Wildberger, many studies have pointed to the numerous Egyptian texts, for example, which speak of the Pharaoh as the image of a god. Although selem and d'mut are never used in Ρ (and, indeed, never in the Hebrew Bible) with reference to a king, Schmidt has no hesitation in claiming that the motif of the image of God is firmly 'anchored' in this royal tradition.211 would suggest that Schmidt's thesis is similar to Lohfink's in that they both require a notion of indirect communication. They differ in that Lohfink's thesis requires only a limited scope for verbal allusions, namely, within the context of his reconstructed Priestly narrative. Schmidt, on the other hand, requires that the reader is familiar with extra-biblical traditions which prevailed at the time of authorship. This does not, in itself, make Lohfink's thesis any more persuasive than Schmidt's, but one notes here that authorial intention can be inferred on the basis of traditions that are entirely 'outside the text'. But what does Schmidt mean by saying that Gen. 1: 26 f. is 'anchored' in royal tradition? The Priestly writer (or writers) does not simply recapitulate the tradition; one could say that he daringly adapts it (so Wildberger),22 or democratizes it, as Schmidt also says.23 Indeed, one might ask whether this is a single tradi tion that is being transformed, or a quite different—perhaps polemical—theological claim about humankind that is being given added force through an allusion to a prevailing royal ideology. But even this second formulation would be too strong for Westermann who suggests that Wildberger and Schmidt's extra-biblical com parisons are misplaced. Westermann argues that one should look for comparisons that speak of the same thing, namely, creation in the image of God. At most, Westermann concedes only that there may be 'echoes' of royal ideology in the verb rdh, 'to rule'.24 He thereby resists the claim that P's account of the image of God intentionally interacts with the extra-biblical royal tradition. In the jargon of recent linguistics, one could say that Westermann wants to stress the indeterminacy of any implicature that involves a royal image of God. 21 W. Η.

BRETT Let me reiterate the main arguments of this section: (1) cases of indirect communication threaten to undermine the proposed distinction between motives and communicative intentions. Our discussion of Lohfink's paper shows, however, that one can still distinguish between P's motive and the indirect communication of the narrative itself. The motive was the same as Second Isaiah's, namely, to engender hope, but it was served by a particular set of paradigmatic narratives; the indirect communicative intention was conveyed by precisely these narratives, and not by prophetic oracles or some other set of narratives.25 Hence, one could say that P's communicative intention was to narrate the foundational history of Israel, the implicature of these narratives was that God's purposes would again be fulfilled, and the motive behind all this was to engender hope in the exiled people of God. Each claim is logically separable. Whether one agrees with Lohfink's analysis or not (indeed, whether one thinks there ever was a Ρ document or not), our discussion provides the framework for a more rigorous analysis of authorial intentionality. Communicative intentions can be direct or indirect, but in either case they should be distin guished from an agent's motives. (2) The royal tradition of the image of God provides us with a second example of indirect communication. In this case, Wester mann's objections underlined the uncertainty of, for example, Schmidt's exegesis of Gen. 1. The democratization of a royal tradition may be thought of as a 'conversational implicature', an indirect communicative intention that cannot be identified with absolute certainty. The problem of indirect communication sug gests that we should think of a continuum of implicatures, from those which were clearly intended to be recovered to those which are indeterminate. In short, communicative intentions are con veyed with varying degrees of subtlety. III. Genre and Intention The final section of this paper does not add anything to the general analysis of intentionality set forth above; it is more of a postscript which further illustrates how the analysis can shed fresh s6 Alternatively, one might say that P's indirect communicative intention would have been satisfied when the audience recognized the author's attempt to address their situation through these narratives. P's motive, on the other hand, would have been satisfied when these narratives actually stirred up hope. Clearly, one can grasp an author's point without being persuaded by it. In the jargon of speech act theory, this is a distinction between illocutionary and perlocutionary intentions. See John Searle Speech Acts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), 42-50; cf. Skinner, ,Motives, Intentions', 402-4.</page><page sequence="13">MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS IN GENESIS I 13 light on old disputes. In particular, we will use the long and complicated debate about Gen. 1 to address the claim (which is received wisdom amongst form critics) that grasping the genre of a text is a necessary condition for understanding its communicative intention. Gen. ι has often been called a 'myth', but what was meant by this term has varied considerably. If one takes a definition along the lines laid down by S. H. Hooke and Mircea Eliade, then myth might be considered a ritual text that seeks to preserve the well being of the world and of humankind.26 As pointed out earlier, this is essentially a statement about motives. Although some scholars see the origins of Gen. 1 in liturgy, few would want to say that the Priestly creation story is itself a myth in the sense of the term promoted by Hooke and Eliade. Westermann, as we have seen, does claim that Gen. 1 is descended from myth in this sense, but he calls the present form of the story a 'narrative',27 and denies that it is directly dependant on any particular myth that preceded it. Such a general and broad category as narrative would seem to include far too much, but what is more important for the present discussion is that the category of narrative seems to fit more with a communicative intention than it does with a motive. The fact that a text has been identified as a narrative tells us nothing about why it was written. Thus, on Westermann's account, the genre classification of the creation story changes character depending on what phase of the story's transmission is being considered; he first makes a claim about motives (when considering the origins of the story) and then a claim about communicative intentions (when considering the present form of the story). Gunkel also sees Gen. 1 as descended from myth (although myth now in the sense of a story about gods). He calls Gen. 1 a 'faded myth'.28 The interesting thing about this claim is that given Gunkel's exegesis of the text, faded myth is not a genre category that one could attribute to the conscious intention of P. On the contrary, Schopfung und Chaos argues that Ρ could not have been aware of the mythological origns of the creation story; that is one of the main reasons why Gunkel can conclude that the story is the deposit of a long tradition. Once again, my concern here is not to arbitrate but to analyse. In reading Gunkel and Westermann we realize that genre classi 26 See J. W. Rogerson, Myth in Old Testament Interpretation (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1974), chs. 8 and 9, and esp. 174-8. Westermann's discussion of Gen. 1 (referred to in n. 15 above) shares this conception of myth. 2' Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 80. 28 Gunkel, Schopfung und Chaos, 117.</page><page sequence="14">14 MARK G. BRETT fications are not one kind of thing. They can shift between claims (a)(a) about motives, (b) about communicative intentions, and (c), at least on Gunkel's account, they might have very little to do with authorial intention at all. Gordon Wenham's recent commentary on Gen. 1-15 provides another interesting example in this connection since he explicitly says that his main concern is to focus on the 'original intentions of of Genesis'.29 But when he comes to discuss the genre of the early chapters of Genesis he decides that they should be understood as 'proto-historical' stories.30 His reasons are twofold. First, he fol lows von Rad in emphasizing that these stories would have been understood by their original audiences as 'factual reports'. Sec ondly, he concedes that they could not be called history in the 'normal' meaning of the term, which apparently means that they could not be called historical writing as we now understand it. Hence, he opts for the term 'proto-historical' in order to mediate between these two considerations. One would need to recognize, however, that it could not have been part of P's communicative intention to tell a proto-historical story. Such a genre classification is inherently retrospective and in this sense anachronistic; it pre sumes the rise of historical writing as we now understand it. A similar point would apply to one of the earlier descriptions of myth as being 'pre-scientific'. It could not have been part of P's intention to be pre-scientific since the very term includes a modern notion of science that had not yet arisen. If one wished both to escape anachronism and to preserve the claim that Gen. 1 was originally intended to be a factual report, then one could perhaps follow the line taken by George Coats in his form-critical commentary on Genesis and say that the genre of the creation story is a 'report'. In making this claim Coats wants to say that the story 'shares with history the intention to record without developing the points of tension characteristic for a plot'.31 Indeed, Coats seems to distinguish between report and history only by saying that a report is 'basically brief, with a single event the subject of its record'.32 He is stretching this definition slightly if he construes creation as a single event, but one can at least agree that Gen. 1 is briefer than, say, the Deuteronomistic History. It is questionable, however, whether the Priestly creation story intends only to record, and not to build points of narrative tension. We have already touched on several studies that point to the 29 G. Wenham, Genesis 1-15 (Waco: Word Books, 1987), xlv-xlvi. 30 Ibid. 54. 31 G. Coats, Genesis FOTL vol. 1 (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1983), 47. 32 Ibid. 10.</page><page sequence="15">MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS IN GENESIS I 15 integral relationship between Gen. 1 and the rest of the Priestly narrative. Indeed, Erich Zenger, for example, speaks precisely of the 'many layered elements of tension' (vielschichtige Spannungs momente) which exist between the blessing of Gen. 1: 26-30 and the whole of P's narrative.33 Similarly, Zenger finds an element of suspense in Gen. 2: 2-3. Why has the seventh day been sancti fied or set apart? To what purpose? For Zenger, the secret of the seventh day is only revealed in the Sinai narrative. At the level of communicative intention, it would seem difficult to follow Coats's view that the creation story is simply a report that lacks the points of tension characteristic for a plot. Indeed, in 'Die Priesterschrift und die Geschichte' Lohfink argues that Ρ has built in far too much structure and plot for the narrative to be consistent with an historical intention. He searches in vain for what he calls 'that humility before the facts' which characterizes historical narrative.34 According to Lohfink, it is not so much history that is narrated in Ρ as paradigmata. The intention of the whole of P, he claims, is best understood in terms of myth.35 I find it difficult to imagine, however, that the Priestly writer (or writers) would ever have confessed to a lack of humility before the facts. If he was consciously distorting history then it would seem more plausible to attribute this to a deeper level of inten tionality, that is, to his motives. At the level of communicative intention Ρ appears to make sincere claims about the past which indirectly give grounds for future hope. If we are to adopt Lohfink's account of myth, which includes playing fast and loose with the facts, then I do not think that this is a genre classification that can be attributed to P's communicative intention. On the contrary, it is best understood as a classification which modern scholars have constructed in order to account for the problems unearthed by the critical study of the Priestly narrative. I have argued elsewhere that such modern critical concepts are for some purposes entirely legitimate,38 but in this context it would be inappropriate to attribute Lohfink's notion of myth to the com municative intention of P. It seems much more likely that with respect to the author's intention, we are dealing here with ancient 33 Ε. Zenger, Gottes Bogen in den Wolken, SBS 112 (Stuttgart: Katholisches Bibelwerk, 1983), 56. From a different perspective, D. J. A. Clines reads Gen. 1: 28 as part of the plot developed in Gen. 2-3.

BRETT standards of historiography. As Coats rightly points out, histori ography as a genre is determined by authorial intention and not by the accuracy of its record as judged by modern standards. But the classification of past-referring genres in ancient societies is a highly complex issue to which this paper provides no easy solu tions. The relationship between genre and intention is, once again, an issue which has received insufficient analysis. Our examination of studies on Gen. 1 demonstrates just how often authorial intentionality has been glibly invoked rather than carefully analysed. This oversight has played into the hands of some biblical critics who wish to dispose of the concept alto gether.37 The preceding discussion represents the beginnings of a more rigorous account of intentionality although it may have oversimplified matters to a certain extent. Instead of constructing a dichotomy, for example, of motives and communicative inten tions, we could perhaps think of continuum from the most explicit and conscious layer of communication down to the most hidden and sub-conscious layer of motives. The examples in this paper, however, should be sufficient to show that we cannot return to a vague and undifferentiated notion of authorial intention. We have uncovered a subtle set of problems which require more and not less analysis.38 Mark G. Brett Mark G. Brett 37 Most recently, in the introduction to What Does Eve Do to Help}, Clines suggests that the hermeneutical fashions in biblical studies have shifted focus over the past three decades from author to text to reader, and that his own volume stands in the readerly mode. It seems to me, however, that given a sufficiently rigorous analysis of authorial intention, and a sufficiently pluralist understanding of biblical studies, at least some of us could remain boldly old-fashioned. 38 The first version of this paper was read in January 1990 at the winter meeting of the British Society for Old Testament Study.
