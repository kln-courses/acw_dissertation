Pp. xii, 263; 108 illustrations. Dfl 97.50. Divina Quaternitas focuses upon an area of medieval studies which though rich in primary sources has had little serious interpretive study. The fourfold method of scriptural exegesis is familiar to every medievalist, but what might be termed "visual exegesis" - the relationship between text and image, in which the picture often has primacy - is much less well known. Professor Esmeijer's book is a valuable, serious study of a number of quadripartite schemata that were used extensively in the Middle Ages; the themes that she selects for particular emphasis are paradise, the city, and the cross. She discusses the ways in which school diagrams and schemata of philosophical relationships provided the basis upon which the structure of multiple visual exegesis was built. These visual exegetic schemes often exemplified cosmic harmony, and as Esmeijer points out, they were closely tied to the fourfold method of interpretation. The importance of the image as a didactic and even mystical aid is discussed with particular reference to paradise imagery and the Speculum Virginum manuscripts. Architectural quaternities are con- sidered in connection with the city of Jerusalem, which was frequently represented in monumental painting programs of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Esmeijer sees the schemata of paradise and city incorporated in the anthropomorphic quaternity of the cross, in which a human figure (not always that of Christ) with arms (and sometimes legs) extended unites a variety of symbolic elements. The author focuses upon three variants of the anthropomorphic cross scheme: that in which the figure encircles a sphere, that in which the figure is incorporated in a cosmic musical instrument, and that in which the figure is involved in tree and ladder diagrams. These visual exegetical schemes are discussed not so much as growing out of verbal exegesis but as a parallel development resulting in an equally valid form of scriptural interpretation. Manuscript illuminations provide the bulk of Esmeijer's visual sources; she does, however, discuss architectural schemes as well. Particularly sig- nificant is her consideration of the relationship between the painted and architectural iconographic programs in churches and the actual human observer or user of the structure; she also discusses funerary chapels and the iconographic role played by the corpse. The iconographic complexities with which Esmeijer is dealing would be best com- prehended if presented in a clear and readable text. Unfortunately, the book suffers from a rather ponderous translation and an extremely dense presentation of exam- ples and details that tend by their profusion to obscure rather than to clarify some of the significant arguments and original interpretations that she presents. At times the text is needlessly difficult to follow. For example, the term "syndesmos figure" is used for the first time on page 42; the author provides no adequate definition of what she means by this, and when we next encounter it on page 97 it appears without</page><page sequence="2">356 Reviews explanation in a reference to Christ in the "syndesmos posture." Thereafter the term is used frequently, and one gains a certain understanding of what is meant. However, it would have been preferable if Esmeijer had given the reader a precise definition of the term early in the discussion. The illustrations are well selected; they provide confirmation of many of the author's arguments and also present the reader with a number of previously unpub- lished, little-known works of considerable iconographic interest. However, like the two-volume edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, the book should come equipped with its own magnifying glass, for the larger illustrations average two by three inches in size, making illustrations with text unreadable and architectural views of fresco programs incomprehensible. A small but rather annoying aspect of the text is the lack of a coherent system of capitalization; thus for example on pages 10 and 11 we find "Greek method," "jewish exegesis," and "translations into latin;" such eccen- tricities of capitalization (or its lack) throughout the book tend to give unintended emphasis to certain elements or figures. There are a few minor typographical errors: Panofsky's book is Tomb Sculpture not Tombsculpture, and in manuscript citations British Museum should be given as British Library. More important are several lacks in an otherwise useful bibliography, which are especially noticeable since bibliog- raphy in this area is not extensive: Johan Chydenius, The Theory of Medieval Symbolism (Helsingfors, 1960), should be mentioned, as well as Meyer Schapiro, Words and Pictures: On the Literal and the Symbolic in the Interpretation of a Text (The Hague, 1973). The merits of the book far outweigh its minor flaws, however, for Professor Esmeijer has provided a truly ground-breaking study of diagrammatic imagery and programs of decoration which as she points out provided medieval man with a pictorialized interpretation of the word, a visual analogy to the scriptural exegesis. Fortunately she does not confine the study purely to medieval schemata but presents a concise discussion of early Christian programs that provided a foundation for those of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Continuation of these schemes into the later Middle Ages is also noted, as for example in the discussion of genealogical trees, which continued to flourish well into the fourteenth century, but the focus of the discussion is on eleventh- and twelfth-century developments. Professor Esmeijer's text is impressively documented with quotations from and references to the writings of early Christian and medieval theologians and churchmen, and she is careful not to make interpretative statements that do not have some sort of documentary buttress- ing. There are extensive notes to the text and a very useful index. The book is subtitled "a preliminary study." It is certainly to be hoped that it will indeed be followed by other works that will explore further the areas opened up in Divina Quaternitas. ELLEN KOSMER Worcester State College</page></plain_text>
