Short and quality articles (not to exceed 15 to 20 typed double spaced pages) including foot-notes and references would be preferable to long ones. The final criteria would be quality over quantity, excellence over mediocrity, and orgi nality over redundancy. Manuscripts are evaluated by the editor, editorial board, and special referees. The author should submit three copies along with an ABSTRACT of 100-150 words for each manuscript. To protect anonymity, only the title should appear on the manuscript and the abstract, but a cover page bearing the title, author's name, and institutional affiliation should accompany each manuscript. The editor relies heavily on the judgments and recom- mendations of the reviewers although he is not bound by them. The process of evalu- ating the manuscript normally takes about 12-14 weeks. If return of submitted manuscript is desired by the author, an appropriate self-a d dressed stamped envelope should be provided. If you also desire acknowledgement of manuscript receipt, please enclose a self-addressed stamped postal card containing manuscript title. Manuscripts are accepted for publication subject to non-substantive editing. Before submitting the paper, please prepare a copy according to IRMS format which includes the following: 1. Type all copies, including indented matter, foot-notes, and references, on white bond 8£x 11 inch paper, double spaced, and on one side of the page. Lines should not exceed six inches with one inch margin at top and bottom of the page. 2. All major headings should be capitalized and centered. All sub headings should be indented five spaces, underlined, and followed by a period. Text imme- diately follows the sub heading. 3. Draw each figure in India Ink and type each on separate pages. Send copies of figures and tables but retain the originals for transmission to the editor as camera ready copy when the paper is accepted. Capitalize all letters of the titles of tables and figures. Insert a location note in numerical order in the text, e.g., "Table 1 about here." 4. Foot-notes should be used only for substantive comments not included in the main text. They should be numbered serially and typed double-spaced on separate sheets at the end of the text before references. Format of References in Text Identify all references to books, monographs, articles, and statistical sources at an appropriate point in the main text by author's last name, year of publication, and pagination where appropriate, all within parentheses. Specify subsequent citations of the same source similarly; do not use "ibid." "op. cit." or "loc. cit" 1. If author's name is in the text, use only year of publication in parentheses, e.g., Upset (1963). If the author's name is not in the text, include both author's name and year of publication separated by a comma within the parentheses, e.g., (Dahrendorf, 1959). 2. Pagination follows year, separated by a colon, e.g., (Domhoff, 1970: 45-46). 3. With dual authorship give both names; for three or more use "et. al." e.g., Lipset and Solari, 1967) and (Rosen et. al., 1969).</page><page sequence="6">VI INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY 4. If more than one reference to the same author and year, distinguish between them by use of letters "a,b, " attached to year of publication; (Moskos 1971a). 5. Enclose within a single pair of parentheses a series of references, separated by semi colons, e.g., (Lang, 1971; Lopreato, 1972; Olsen, 1973). 6. For institutional/organizational authorship provide minimum identification from the beginning of the complete citation, e.g., (American Political Science Associa- tion, 1971;&amp;5) and (United States Bureau of the Census, 1972). Format of References in Appendix List all entries cited ill the text or any other items used to prepare the manuscript alphabetically by autfior and year of publication in an appendix entitled "REFERE- NCES". If there is more than' one publication by the same author, use year of publication for subsiequeftt citations. Identify1 bookè' by author's last name, his first name and middle initial (where appropriate); b'elovV 'author's last name, place, year of publication; title of monograph/ book; place of pJblicatiòn and name of publisher.

Good reviews should be informative and critical of the author's contribution to the field. Normally they should not exceed 500-700 words since space is severely limited. There are, of course, no standard rules for writing book reviews, and no two people will review a book in exactly the same way. Nevertheless, the following guidelines and editorial policies concerning book reviews should help to make your review beneficial for both author and reader : (1) State as comprehensively and parsimoniously as possible the scope, objectives and content of the book, so that the reader can understand and decide whether or not the book has relevance and value for him and his discipline. (2) When evaluating the book, give detailed documentation for your criticisms, both positive and negative. Comments that a book is "Unsophisticated" or "exciting" or "polemic" or "insightful" tell the reader nothing without elaboration and examples. ' &lt; ' &gt;- (3) Except when necessary to substantiated criticism of the book, avoid references to your own research or writing. Remember that the purpose of your review is to give a concise synopsis of the author's work and your own critical evaluation of the book. The review should be consistent with the canons of clarity, comprehensiveness, and professional craftsmanship. (4) Edited books present a special problem, if there are more than three or four contributions, description and evaluation of each contribution is usually not possible (and in any event is not desirable). Some contributions may be chosen for special criticism or praise or may be mentioned to illustrate general points, but most of the review should describe and evaluate the book as a whole. (5) When we solicit a book review, the editors have tentatively decided that the book deserves a review in International Review of Modern Sociology. However, you as a reviewer may decide, after close examination of the book, that our tentative judgment is incorrect. In such a case, you may recommend that the book not be reviewed; please do not write a review. (6) These guidelines are offered not to temper the force of forthright evaluation and criticism but rather to maintain International Review of Modern Sociology book reviews at the highest level of quality. Bcok review manuscripts may be edited slightly to achieve brevity, grammatical accuracy, or stylistic consistency, but we will make every effort to insure that such minor revisions do not in any way alter the content or meaning of the review. Format of Book Reviews (1) The heading should be typed as follows: The Family in Asia, edited by Man Singh Das and Panos D. Bardis, New Delhi, India: Vikas Publishing House, 1978. 431 pp. $ 12.00 cloth. $ 6,97 paper. JOHN E. REVIEWER ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, TEMPE (1) If you are reviewing several books in one review, please list them alpha- betically by author.</page><page sequence="8">VIII INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY (2) Please note that our stamp inside the book tells you the maximum length for your review and when it is due. (3) The editors reserve the right to edit reviews for style, conciseness, consistency of punctuation, and unless you request we not do so, for sexist language. (4) Please avoid quoting long passages from the book you are reviewing. Paraph- rase when possible. Always give the page number of the quote. (5) Please avoid using references and footnotes. If a quotation from another work is absolutely necessary, please incorporate the reference into the text. The form of the reference should be : (Das and Bardis, The Family in Asia, 1978;230). (6) Double-space your manuscript, including the heading. (7) Do not break words at the end of a line. It is sometimes unclear whether or not the hyphen indicates a compound word. (8) Use non-erasable paper. (9) Please send two copies of your review (original and duplicate), and keep a copy for your own files, to our Book Review Editor. (10) We would like to discourage reviewers from sending pre-publication copies of their reviews to the author of the book being reviewed. This has created some problems for us in the past. (11) Please beat the assigned deadline if possible. The delay between publication of the books and a review is already running far behind what is optimal. If some- thing prevents you from completing the review on time, please let us know and we will arrange an extension.</page><page sequence="9">INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY Volume 22 Autumn, 1992 Number 2 CONTENTS ARTICLES Group - Integrated Reality Therapy : Functional Relations to Rehabilitating Felons 1 F.
