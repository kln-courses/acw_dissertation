Hubbard General Motors Research Laboratories HUMAN ANTHROPOMETRY is an essential input to the de- sign of crash test dummies. The location of joint centers and the weights and centers of gravity of the various dummy seg- ments are among the primary factors which determine the kinematics of a dummy in a crash test. If the dummy is to be used as a meaningful basis for human injury assessment, then these characteristics must be based on human anthropometry. As part of the program to design and develop the GM ATD 502 dummy*, guidelines were established for crash dummy dimensions, weight, and weight distribution. These guidelines and their anthropometric bases are presented in this paper. EXTERIOR BODY DIMENSIONS The exterior body dimensions given in SAE Recommended Practice J963 are referred to in Fig. 1 and Table 1 of J963 by the letters: I, J, L through Z, and A-A (Fig. 1 and Table 1). These dimensions were recommended to SAE by H. T. E. Hertzberg and R. W. White based on data available at the time *GM ATD 502, General Motors Anthropomorphic Test Dummy, 50th Percentile, Design 2, developed under contract number DOT-HS-299-3-569 with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. of formulation of J963 (1968). Although these dimensions do not completely describe the exterior configuration of a dummy, they have been used as guidelines for the GM ATD 502 dummy design. Work by Hubbard and McLeod (1)** has provided a geo- metric description of the head which is much more extensive than that given in J963. This added geometric detail has been incorporated into the GM ATD 502 dummy head design, has been presented and discussed in Ref. 2, and will not be dis- cussed at length in this paper. PIVOT LOCATIONS AND SEGMENT SEPARATION If the weight and weight distribution of dummy segments are to be defined, then a segmentation scheme must also be defined with reference to identifiable skeletal landmarks. An attempt was made to locate some significant points of human skeletal articulation to form a basis for specifications of pivot points and segmentation of the GM ATD 502 dummy. Many of the guidelines for pivot location in the GM ATD 502 dummy were established somewhat arbitrarily, based on past **Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT Human anthropometry was used as input to the design of the GM ATD 502 crash test dummy. The spinal column of an average adult male was located for an erect seated position leading to guidelines for placement of dummy components and sectioning of the dummy into segments. The weight and weight distribution of these dummy segments were defined based on anthropometric data. These results provide some as- surance that the size, relative location, and weight distribution of dummy structures are representative of human charac- teristics. 1151</page><page sequence="2">1152 R.P.HUBBARD Fig. 1 - Body dimensions and sectioning from SAE Recommended Practice J963 dummy design practice. This was particularly true for the limbs. However, a concerted effort was directed at describing the location of the human vertebral column in an erect seated position and defining guidelines for differentiation and place- ment of the components of the dummy included in the head, neck and torso. Locations of anthropometric landmarks of the human skull have been determined relative to the external surface of the head (1). Geometric specifications for crash dummy head de- velopment, which includes the location of the axis of rotation at the occipital condyles, were used in the development of the GM ATD 502 dummy head (2); the occipital condylar axis is shown in Fig. 2. So that the position of the GM ATD 502 dummy head could be related to human eye locations in auto- motive seating environments (3), the location of the eye pupil was specified, based on Ref. 1 , and is shown in Fig. 2. Also shown in Fig. 2 is a segmentation plane which was based on Ref. 1 and presented in Ref. 2 for demarcation of dummy heads so that their weight and weight distribution could be defined.

However, the primary assumptions used to accomplish this location were: 1. The Frankfort plane of the head was horizontal and the head was 1.7 in (43 mm) from the back line. 2. The body contacts the back line at the eighth thoracic surface marker. 3. The lumbar reference angle measured from the center of the first sacral- fifth lumbar disc to the center of the disc be- tween the first and second lumbar vertebrae was 10 deg (0.17 rad) posterior of vertical. The third assumption was not necessary for the body sec- tioning described below, but it did facilitate the location of the lumbar spine for added information. This description of the vertebral column was used as a basis for locating parts or subassemblies of the GM ATD 502 dummy head, neck, and torso in an erect seated posture. Seg- mentation planes were defined with reference to the vertebral column so that the dummy subassemblies could be differen- tiated and their weights and weight distributions could be specified with reference to human characteristics. The outer skin surface of the dummy is shown in side view (Fig. 4) with the buttocks and thoracic regions touching the back line and the rear of the head 1.7 in (43 mm) forward of the back line. Also shown are points on the vertebral column which relate directly to the points on the interfaces between dummy subassemblies. The pivot points for the shoulders, el- bows, hips and knees shown in Fig. 4 were not located in this study based on human anthropometry. They were accepted for the GM ATD 502 from previous dummy design practice. The coordinate system used in Fig. 4 is the same as that used for Fig. 3. The upper neck pivot, A, is coincident with the axis of rota- tion of the atlantöoccipital joint between the first cervical vertebra and skull, SKULL/Cļ. Location of this joint center was accomplished with reference to head geometry based on the work of Hubbard and McLeod (1) and with reference to the head and torso based on the work of Snyder, et al. (4). The results of these two location approaches agree closely. The lower neck pivot, B, is coincident with the middle of the interspace between the seventh cervical and first thoracic ver- tebrae, Cy/Tļ, based on study of the work of Snyder, et al. (4). The neck-upper body section plane is through the lower neck pivot, is perpendicular to the line through the upper and lower neck pivots, and is inclined 4.75 deg (0.083 rad) from the horizontal (Fig. 4). This section plane is an acceptable anatomical delineation of the neck from the body and is a convenient disassembly section for the GM ATD 502 dummy. Sectioning the human torso into segments which move as single parts during a crash test, such as the chest or the pelvic section, is extremely difficult because of the geometric com- plexity of the structures involved and is of questionable valid- ity because of mobility of tissues within or between these dif- ferent segments. For these reasons, the torso has been divided somewhat artibrarily into two pieces which are referred to as the upper torso and the lower torso. The section plane be- tween these two segments is through the upper lumbar pivot, C, and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane at an angle of 7.5 deg (0.13 rad) as shown in Fig. 4. This section plane coincides with the plane of separation between the lumbar spine and rib cage back structure of the GM ATD 502 dummy and was se- lected so that the inertial properties of the dummy could be measured without cutting the back structure. Comparing the locations of this section plane with the location of the center of the twelfth thoracic-first lumbar vertebral interspace, T 1 2/L 1 as shown in Fig. 4, indicates that the upper body- lower body section plane cuts through the dummy at a level which closely corresponds to the junction between the lumbar and thoracic spine in a human. The lateral distance between the shoulder pivots should be 14.5 in (0.37 m), the shoulder pivots should be equidistant from the midsagittal plane, and the separation planes between the arms and the upper torso of the dummy should be parallel to the midsagittal plane and through the shoulder pivots shown in Fig. 4. For determination of weights and centers of gravity locations, the lower arms and hands should be straight- ened so that their long axes are colinear with the long axes of the respective upper arms and separation should occur at planes through the respective elbow pivots and perpendicular to the long axes of the arms. The upper arm segment extends from the shoulder separation plane to the elbow separation plane, and the lower arm and hand segment is distal from the</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOMETRIC DUMMY 1155 elbow separation plane. Weights for the arm segments are presented later in this report. The separation plane which delineates the legs from the lower torso of the dummy is a vertical plane which is perpen- dicular to the midsagittal plane and is a distance of 10 in (0.25 m) forward of the back line of the dummy in the erect seated position. This leg sectioning is consistent with SAE Recommended Practice J963 and accommodates an uninter- rupted skin surface in the region of lap belt loading. For weight specification, the upper leg segment extends from this plane to a plane which is through the knee pivot and perpen- dicular to the long axis of the upper leg where the long axes of the upper and lower legs are colinear. The lower leg and foot segment is distal from the knee separation plane. Again, weights of the leg segments are given later. WEIGHTS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY In this section the weights and centers of gravity are speci- fied for the dummy segments delineated by the section planes given above. The specifications are based on the human an- thropometric data available in the literature, and they provide some assurance that the weight distribution of a dummy is rep- resentative of humans. The values of inertial properties used in the development of the GM ATD 502 head have been presented and discussed in Ref. 2. The nominal values of these properties are a weight of 10.0 lb (mass of 4.54 kg), a center of gravity located as de- scribed in Fig. 4 and Table 3, and a mass moment of inertia about a lateral axis through the center of gravity of 0.207 in • lb -sec2 (0.00181 kg-m2). The neck weight of an average size adult male has been es- timated by three approaches: 1 . Using average neck circumference, the neck length of Fig. 3 and Table 2, and average tissue density. 2. Studying Dempster's work (5). 3. Studying Alderson Research Laboratories' work (6). All these approaches yield a neck weight of 3.1 lb (mass of 1.41 kg) which is the value used as a guideline for GM ATD 502 dummy. A specification for neck center of gravity is not included due to a lack of adequate anthropometric data. It is suggested that the center of gravity of the neck lies midway be between the upper and lower neck pivots. A limited quantity of data is presently available concerning the mass distribution of the human torso. The study by Clauser, McConville, and Young (7) is the most extensive and thoroughly documented work on this subject; and it offers a review of virtually all the significant previous studies in this area. Unfortunately, Clauser, et al., did not section the torso to closely study its weight distribution. Dempster (5) did sec- tion the torsos of his cadavers, but his section scheme was very complex and not well documented. Because these studies do not provide adequate information, it was necessary to use the results of Alderson Research Lab- oratories (ARL) (6) as a basis for specifying the weights and centers of gravity of the upper and lower torso segments for use in the GM ATD 502 dummy. The work of ARL was based Table 3 - Coordinates for Vertebral Landmarks, Dummy Pivots, and Body Segment Centers of Gravity Coordinates- in (mm) Point Description x z A Upper neck pivot 5.3 29.7 (135) (754) SKULL/Cj Axis at occipital condyles 5.3 29.7 (135) (754) B Lower neck pivot 4.9 24.8 (124) (630) Cyr^ Seventh cervical 4.9 24.8 First thoracic disc center (124) (630) F Shoulder pivot 4.0 21.6 (102) (549) C Upper lumbar pivot 3.6 13.3 (91) (338) T^/Lļ Twelfth thoracic 3.4 13.5 First lumbar disc center (86) (343) H Hip pivot 4.0 5.0 (102) (127) D Knee pivot 20.7 2.1 (526) (53) G Elbow pivot 4.0 11.1 (102) (282) Head center of 6.0 31.6 gravity (152) (803) Upper torso center 4.0 18.0 of gravity (102) (457) Lower torso center 5.4 5.8 of gravity (137) (147) on placing an appropriate size human skeleton inside the 50th percentile male Dummy Master Body Form (Golden Shell) and filling that form with material of density equal to that of the tissues in the corresponding regions of the human body. These forms were then sectioned and the inertial properties mea- sured. By measuring the sectioned body segments and compensat- ing for the differences between the ARL sectioning and the sectioning described in the previous section, the weights and centers of gravity of the upper and lower body segments were determined for the present study. The centers of gravity are shown on Fig. 4, and weights are listed with other body seg- ment weights in Table 4. The sum of the weights given in Table 4 for head, neck and upper and lower body segments is 102.1 lb (mass of 46.3 kg). This agrees closely with the weight of head and trunk as measured by Clauser, et al. (7), when compensation is made for the differences in lower body-upper leg sectioning. Subsequent to the definition of the weight requirements for the 502 dummy, the weight characteristics of sectioned ca- daver torsos were measured and related to living torsos by Liu and Wickstrom (8). The sections were through the interverte- bral discs for the entire spine and were nominally perpen- dicular to the superior-inferior direction. The resulting seg- ments that included the thoracic vertebrae were comparable to the upper torso segment of the present study except that</page><page sequence="6">1156 R. P.

The weight of thoracic segments and half the weight of the first lumbar segment are 36.8 lb (mass of 16.69 kg) when adjusted for the difference in the mean cadaver weight and that of the average adult male. This weight is only 1 .4 lb (mass of 0.64 kg) less than the specifica- tion of the upper torso segment given in Table 4, which adds assurance that the torso weights in Table 4 are representative of human characteristics. Liu and Wickstrom presented esti- mated locations for the centers of gravity of the fourth-twelfth thoracic segments which ranged from 1-1.5 in (25-38 mm) anterior to the corresponding vertebral disc centers. These re- sults agree with the upper torso center of gravity location spec- ified in the present study, which is 1 in (25 mm) anterior to the center of the vertebral column. Also listed in Table 4 are weights for the upper arms, lower arms and hands, upper legs and lower legs and feet. The ca- daver sectioning scheme used by Clauser and his coworkers for the extremities agrees closely with the sectioning described above in this report, except for the delineation of upper leg from lower body. The weight values given in Table 4 for the extremities are taken from Clauser, et al., (7) with the upper leg weights compensated for the difference in sectioning. These values of extremity weights were selected instead of the ARL results because they were measured directly on human cadavers in a manner which is compatible with the needs of the GM ATD 502 program. Centers of gravity for the upper arms, lower arms and hands, upper legs, and lower legs and feet are not specified from a basis of human anthropometry in this report. The anthropo- metric information presently available is not adequate to spec- ify these centers of gravity with an acceptable degree of confidence. CONCLUSIONS This work significantly contributes to the anthropometric basis for crash dummy design in the following ways: 1 . The vertebral column is located for an average adult male in an erect seated posture. 2. A demarcation scheme is defined for dummy segments with a known correspondence to human structure. 3. Weight and weight distribution guidelines are presented for these dummy segments based on human anthropometric data. These results were used in the design and development of the GM ATD 502 dummy. Although they were not intended as definitive dummy requirements, the guidelines do represent progress in relating the size, placement and weight distribution of dummy structures to the corresponding human structures. RECOMMENDATIONS Human anthropometric data is an essential input to the de- sign of crash test dummies. Based on the experience gained in this study and the needs of dummy development, the follow- ing work is recommended: 1. Define the location of human body structures in a range of automotive seats with particular emphasis on the location of the head, chest and pelvis. 2. Define the configuration of human shoulders, chest and pelvis. 3. Define the anthropometric characteristics of children and large and small male and female adults based on a rational sizing scheme.
