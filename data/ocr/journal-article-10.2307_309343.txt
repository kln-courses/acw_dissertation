<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LOST LAND OF LITHUANIA: THE POLISH EMIGRE PERSPECTIVES IN THE NOVELS OF JOZEF MACKIEWICZ Nina Taylor, London (United Kingdom) After the failure of the November Uprising of 1830-31, what was elsewhere a purely literary topos of exile and pilgrimage became the hereditary fate of the Poles. Poland was razed from the map of Europe, only to survive in the collective memory and imagination as a spiritual kingdom waiting to be made incarnate in the future. Polish romantic poetry created compensatory options and potentials, a whole array of characteristic themes, styles and roles,' and provided the yardstick against which every successive 6migr6 measures his experience and mythologizes his situation accordingly. By deciding not to return to Poland after the end of the Second World War, Poles were electing a variant of the national fate. According to the emigr6 decalogue enounced by Tymon Terlecki, such a choice was charac- terized by "rebelliousness and incorruptibility." It betrayed an "aspiration to another reality" (Terlecki "O standard") and amounted to an act of faith (Terlecki, "Po dziesipciu"). In the words of Jan Bielatowicz, emigration was not an escape, but a perspective that implied accepting the challenge to fight: hence a two-pronged program of obligations and benefits. Advantages to be gained from geographical displacement were assumed to derive prin- cipally from the enriching experience of living amidst an alien culture. But the most significant single advantage is the 6migr6's intellectual freedom to write "what he likes, how he likes" (Bielatowicz, "Literatura"). A priori, it would thus appear that the 6migr6 option bestows an unlim- ited sense of creative freedom. Unshackled by political, social, and cultural constraints, the 6migr6 writer is theoretically at liberty to indulge in formal experimentation and other avant-garde endeavors. If this asset increases in value during the period of Stalinist conformity, it may be offset by the duties of the 6migr6 as legal oppositionist to the communist government in Poland. Paradoxically enough, the benefits of untrammelled liberty contain the seeds of their own negation. Czeslaw Milosz has complained that free- dom of speech is a dubious value when there is no one to listen; and pres- SEEJ, Vol. 33, No. 2 (1989) 190</page><page sequence="2">The Lost Land of Lithuania: J6zef Mackiewicz 191 sure of 6migr6 public opinion is known on occasion to play the role of establishment censor. Duties and obligations of the 6migr6 man of letters include perpetuating as much as possible of Poland's past traditions and preserving the continuity of Polish thought and cultural institutions. The assumption underlying both these points is that without awareness of the past there can be no concept of the future (Kowalik, 520). The 6migr6 brief entails uninhibited chroni- cling of experience, and-privilege no less than duty-the presentation of unabridged, unexpurgated history. Among Polish writers who fetched up on alien shores following World War II, a more acute form of loss and exile is experienced by 6migres originating from the northeastern borderland and the territory of the onetime Grand Duchy of Lithuania: Florian Czarnyszewicz (1895-1964), Sergiusz Piasecki (1899-1964), J6zef Mackiewicz (1902-85), Michal K. Pawlikowski (d. 1972), Wiktor Trogcianko (1911-83).2 Apart from Czarnyszewicz, who left the banks of his native Berezyna after the treaty of Riga, then failed to eke out an existence in Independent Poland, and emigrated to Argentina in 1924, they all belong to the wave of wartime political emigration. Numerous aspects of the oeuvre of Czeslaw Mizlosz (b. 1911), who chose political asylum in the West in 1951, also assign him to this group. Of all Polish 6migres they are the least adjusted to postwar pacts and treaties. In the aftermath of Yalta, theirs is the land from which God, pri- vate ownership, and most forms of national, cultural and individual diver- sity are similarly outlawed. They thus present an extreme instance of the emigre predicament. For exiles from Lithuania the land of childhood has ceased to exist; there is simply nowhere to return. Their awareness of exile is often exacerbated by isolation from the emigre majority, which is some- times prone to underestimate, misinterpret or ignore their oeuvre, and by their own inability or unwillingness to participate in social organizations and institutions, or conform ideologically to the established behaviour patterns of the 6migr6 collective (Milosz, "Nie," "Noty"). Between them the "writers from Lithuania" have left a substantial body of literature that forms a major contribution to the Polish emigre novel.3 The oeuvre of Czarnyszewicz, Piasecki, Mackiewicz, and much of Milosz's prose presents an interlocking, mutually complementary composition that records the historical mishaps of their native realm in the twentieth century. It may thus be read as a rational and factual prelude to the "Lithuanian" novels of other writers from the territory of Wilno now living in People's Poland, such as Tadeusz Konwicki and Zbigniew Zakiewicz.4 By its very nature, their fictional world constitutes an enclave within Polish 6migr6 literature. It is conditioned by an idiosyncratic form of spir-</page><page sequence="3">192 Slavic and East European Journal ituality, the borderland version of Polishness combined with regional sep- aratism and an often strong admixture of Jagiellonian broadness of perspec- tive. It reveals a distinct set of priorities and attachments. The determinants of difference are manifold: genetic, historical, and cultural memory; indi- vidual childhood recollections of people, landscape, spatial dimensions, and spatial relations-from the central Polish angle a displaced centre of gravity. From this vantage point the personal experience of war and the paradoxes of the Western alliance are often differently interpreted, as interests are almost diametrically opposed. Difficulties notwithstanding, the novelists from Polish Lithuania have created an integrally restored universe. Consciously or otherwise, their reconstruction of a lost world harks back to the romantic prototype of exile literature, Adam Mickiewicz's Pan Tadeusz, and its vision of the archetypal Polish manor house of Soplicowo. Through the apotheosis of its landscape in Pan Tadeusz, Lithuania is the most celebrated locus amoenus in Polish literature. It is pluralistic, contain- ing elements of the authentic and the autobiographical; the lyrical has a direct correlation in the metaphysical, and a vision of infinity (Zgorzelski in Opacki and Zgorzelski, 83 ff.; also Taylor, "Adam Mickiewicz"). It is pro- jected as the land of first love and the land of communion with the dead, the land where the living and the dead form a joint entity (Swianiewiczowa, Przybylski). Myth, legend, history, and reality are not easily disentangled (Taylor) for in the literate imagination, Lithuania is the land of bards, witch-doctors and magicians, prophets and mystics, messianists and martyrs (Milosz, "Spojrzenie"). Placed morally, historically, and affectively at the center, it has become the home of Every Pole, the Polish Paradise, and the Polish Jerusalem (Bloniski, Zaleski). These elements are therefore de l'acquis and form part of readers' expectations, creating the kaleidoscopic standard against which the literary work will be tested. The hallmarks of Mickiewicz's method are idealization and hyperbole, and it involves passing over in silence the more drastic aspects of historical reality. In setting J6zef Mackiewicz's oeuvre within the Mickiewicz canon, men- tion must be made of a significant feature: memory. In testifying to history, to self, to the departed and deported, Mackiewicz displays a memory that is absolute, untrammelled by the enforced dosage of amnesia, and free from the manipulations of shifting political ideologies that beset his confreres in communist Poland. His narratives are admittedly often based on source materials and historical publications; a bibliography is even given at the end of Kontra. According to Jan Bielatowicz ("Droga," 132), The Road to Nowhere (Droga donikqd) already existed in outline before Mackiewicz left Poland, having been drafted under the fresh impact of events. Mackiewicz's command of past events would seem to derive from a number of concurrent factors. It is part of the hereditary "borderland tradi- tion," habitually associated with the nobility of the Easter marches (of which</page><page sequence="4">The Lost Land of Lithuania: J6zef Mackiewicz 193 the poetry of Mickiewicz is the supreme embodiment). The collective memory of history-transmitted orally from one generation to the next throughout a century when the Polish language was all but outlawed-more than once salvages incidents of uprisings and massacres that no censor would tolerate in printed form. Mackiewicz's mnemonic power must finally be seen in the context of his prewar journalistic practice, and its first literary manifestation, Marshland Rebellion (Bunt rojstdw, 1938). At all events, it would appear from his conversations with Ewa Czarnecka that Czeslaw Milosz regards J6zef Mackiewicz as the highest authority in the art of minute observation and notation of real-life details (Czarnecka, Podrd2ny, 112). The absolute standard is all the more striking in view of the fact that the world in question had ceased to exist in any readily recognizable form. Memory is here no less radical than that of the Jews in the diaspora, for it rises against death itself (P. Nora cited Ertel, 299). On one level, the modern Polish-Lithuanian novelists have the edge on Mickiewicz. The universe re-created by Czarnyszewicz, Piasecki, and Mac- kiewicz is not the ideal world of the status quo, as their poetic patron would have it, but a home threatened by aggression, deportation, and ulti- mate extermination. In depicting the small provincial townships and forests of their native backwater, the blurred outline of roads, and the lazy mean- dering rivers and marshy river banks, they may concentrate on the portrayal of nature, or of social customs and ethnographic curiosities. Focusing on historical events and firsthand experience of war and occupation, they chronicle to an unprecedented extent the successive losses of their all but forgotten part of Europe. In registering the recent history of Poland's Lithuanian-Belorussian borderland, they exploit the possibilities of undoc- tored, uncensored history to the maximum. Unhampered by political and social censorship and braving internal inhibitions, Mackiewicz in particular has resisted the pressure of Mickiewicz's landscape aesthetics to create-or co-create-what is arguably the first unvetted portrait of Lithuania in which there are no blank pages. This is the first major departure from the Mickiewicz canon. The bone of censorial contention was always Russian, then Soviet expansion Westwards through the territories of the Grand Duchy. The subject receives full treat- ment in Mackiewicz's trilogy of Poland's wars along the Eastern frontier: Clearway for the Left (Lewa wolna), The Road to Nowhere, and Don't Tell It Out Loud (Nie trzeba gloino mdwic). It is, for Poland and for Lithuania, the most significant area of wartime experience, one that has had the most lasting consequences, and is still relevant to the fate of Europe today. It may therefore be symptomatic that the vast historical background embraced in Mackiewicz's oeuvre is framed by the two novels devoted to the Russian world. They are the most ambitious in scale. Kontra, the saga of a family of Don Cossacks, provides the terminus a quo and terminus ad</page><page sequence="5">194 Slavic and East European Journal quem of fictional action in Mackiewicz's oeuvre, spanning the period from 1860 to June 1945. The Colonel Miasojedov Affair (Sprawa pulkownika Mia- sojedowa) takes its beginning in the tsarist epoch on "Friday 6th March, 1903, along the Petersburg-Luga-Pskow-Dzwinsk-Wilno railway line," and ends in Vienna ten days after the bombing of Dresden by the Allies in February 1945. Within this outer ring, Clearway for the Left deals with the period from 1915 to the Polish-Bolshevik war, and ends in January 1921, immediately prior to the Treaty of Riga. The Road to Nowhere spans the Soviet occupation of Wilno between the late summer of 1940 to 17 June 1941, while its sequel Don't tell it out loud follows on with the German invasion, starting on 22 June 1941, till the action appears to dissolve somewhere in mid-January 1945.5 While Mackiewicz's trilogy of war along the Eastern frontier is an unmit- igated record of disaster, the narrator betrays no signs of self-commiseration or hurrah-patriotism. National heroes and martyrs are seldom if ever in evidence. Within the historical framework, Mackiewicz's narrative time is chronological, linear, and coherent in its sequence. It presents less the reconstruction of a social structure than the register of its decay, destruc- tion, and death. The sequence consists of the individual, unique, irreversible moments that precede and harbinger ultimate catastrophe, after which there will be no eternal return. The past pluperfect tense of Mickiewicz's Pan Tadeusz contains in fact a plurality of times, the vista of a self-generating natural scene and the Proustian promise of a past that projects an embry- onic future. Milosz's fabularization of childhood in his Issa Valley has been termed a fairy-tale of immortality and myth of restitution, closely related to his concept of apocatastasis (Czarnecka, Podrdony, 283-99; Czarnecka, "Dolina"). Mackiewicz's linear time allows for no such potential: compared to Mickiewicz and Milosz, it is a bleak vision he offers. His novels of war on the territory of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania register a turning-point in the evolution of Christianity, and the end of a certain mode of thinking of God, man, and civilization. The end is absolute. Mackiewicz's use of linear time is historical in a Hegelian sense: the subjective time of private life and individual experiences collides with the objective time of implacable historical necessity. This is made poignantly explicit in The Road to Nowhere, which records the brutal transition from local Wilno time to Kremlin time (Zielifiski). It amounts to the destruction of human, organic time, and its appropriation and manipu- lation to serve the purposes of alien ideology. Passed through the commu- nist pulp-mill, the eternal anachronism of the Eastern borderland lifestyle is forcibly reduced to a state of permanent stasis, to what in post-war Polish life and literature has become a permanently provisional time of waiting. The events chronicled by Mackiewicz are monstrous, and by the same token too tragic for lament and self-pity. Their nature is a historiosophical issue,</page><page sequence="6">The Lost Land of Lithuania: J6zef Mackiewicz 195 documented in the narrative and plot, and reflected in the texture of imagery and deeper meaning, without however impinging on novelistic structure. Except perhaps in one respect. The concluding pages of Mackiewicz's novels often reveal a certain shapelessness: protagonists appear to fade and dissolve, left in the lurch on the verge of total disappearance. This surely is a graphic transcription of the fate that befell thousands of Mackiewicz's countrymen, who following the events of war were quite literally mislaid in the whirlwind of history. The situation is epitomized in a brief syncretic family saga entitled "Auntie Pafcia's Faux-pas" ("Faux-pas Ciotki Pafci," first published 1952), summarizing the gradual drifting and dispersal of several generations of a Wilno family. For similar reasons, in the novels of J6zef Mackiewicz the human figure and his psychology are often dwarfed by the drastic magnitude of events. The "hero" is "collective." Mackiewicz's overriding need to testify would seem to inhibit and indeed preclude innovativeness and experimentalism in the temporal structure of his fictions. Innovation may yet be found on other levels. Mackiewicz's novels have been assigned a variety of labels: historical novels, novels of manners, political studies, dramatized reportages, romans 'a clef or romans a these. The mixing of genres is admittedly hardly a novelty within the "Lithuanian" canon, whose poetic blueprint has been described as summa genorum. While the demands of actual reportage govern the time structure, they also account for a major new departure in the literary tradition of the Eastern borderlands. The inclusion of press information, decrees of occu- pational powers, notes of treatises and diplomatic agreements, and other extraneous material, often quoted verbatim, may possibly be traced back to earlier journalistic practices; and in a number of instances Mackiewicz has been taken to task by critics for making excessive publicistic interpolations. Yet it also helps create a narrative taut with suspense. Factual expression has priority over artistic experiment and constitutes what is virtually an aesthetic category on its own. The use of the printed document should therefore be seen as an intrinsic part of Mackiewicz's artistic workshop. This is furthermore connected with the stance of an unsentimental narra- tor who relates what no narrator could formerly brook, yet (unlike the frequently discredited narrators of Konwicki's novels) enjoys health and faculties unimpaired. Memory's perennial companion, nostalgia, is kept in leash. In the face of justifiable despair, emotional control is admirable: witness the comment in Don't Tell It Out Loud as a whole world approaches its end: "And Eastern Europe? Oh, the hell with you! Vanish! Disappear!" ("A wschodnia Europa? Ech, propadi ty propadom, bodaj by' ty przepadla, sczezla"; Nie trzeba glo'no mwic', 542). Though documentation endows them with all the appearances of veracity, Mackiewicz's novels remain fictional inventions, bearing witness to that "lesser truth" announced by their author in the introductions to The Road</page><page sequence="7">196 Slavic and East European Journal to Nowhere and Kontra. For, paradoxical though it may seem, maximal objectivity is attained through the subjective perceptions of the individual. At the same time the interpenetration of genres permits him to orchestrate a great experimental historic polyphony: the enemy speaks for himself, and unmasks himself accordingly. Moreover, in exploiting the full potential of undoctored history, Mackiewicz's borderline genre of documentary fiction or fictional documentary investigates history's controversies, probing its less known and less popular aspects. This entails exposing what Mackiewicz considered, fancifully perhaps, to be the errors of strategy and diplomacy on the part of the Polish Headquarters. The result is a speculative prognos- tic, a hypothesis or theory of history that might have been, or ought to have been. Mackiewicz is deemed by some to have overstepped his 6migr6 brief, provocatively and waywardly extending his privileges to the point of deheroizing events, stances, and deeds, and criticizing issues of national patriotism and national hagiography. Hence the paradox that though writ- ing in circumstances meant to ensure unfettered free speech, Mackiewicz on occasion saw himself the object of attack, and his texts clipped by the edi- torial scissors. Documentary realism is also a feature of Mackiewicz's handling of topog- raphy and nature. He dispenses with the set pieces of landscape embellish- ment by means of which Mickiewicz, Eliza Orzeszkowa, and J6zef Weys- senhoff have crystallized the Polish vision of the Lithuanian countryside.6 Landscape depiction in Mackiewicz's novels serves primarily practical aims. It is strictly harnessed to the narrative and integrated with the action. He records and illustrates topography only insofar as it is necessary to localize an army skirmish, or the passage of troops. His aim is to inform. He notes distances and location, the state of roads, the proximity of railways, and the direction of telegraph-wires with the precision of an ordnance survey map. He spans in this manner a vast geographical expanse, from the Han- seatic coast of the Baltic to the marshes of the Pripet in Polesie, from Czar- nyszewicz's distant Berezyna world to Konwicki's Forest of Rudniki, with further excursions over the border into the Russian empire and the land of the Don Cossacks. He explores moreover areas uncharted by the cartogra- phers, lost localities and unnamed rivers, ill-defined zones that give rise to premonitions of the infinite and immortality. Space is symbolized by the road, "something without which man's life would be mere vegetation. Plants vegetate, but they do not live, because they cannot move, cannot walk onto the road and along it. But without the roads along which he walks man is unthinkable" (The Road to Nowhere, 189). The road therefore signifies freedom. Restrictions of the right to move are a limitation of that freedom. The oxymoronic title of The Road to Nowhere refers to man at the end, at the moment when on the lands between "aboriginal" Poland and "aboriginal" Russia a world came to an end (Zie-</page><page sequence="8">The Lost Land of Lithuania: J6zef Mackiewicz 197 liriski). It spells the end of the great road of history that brought the Napo- leonic army into the homestead of Soplicowo and linked the manor houses of Lithuania with the capitals of civilized Europe. The end of the muddy, potholed, serpentine country lanes along which village bards and itinerant monks used to wend their way. It represents moreover contradictio in adjecto: the road without exit, the limitation of an infinite horizon. Open space snaps close. The infinite is no more. The suppression of two dimen- sions-time and space-amounts to a negation of Poland's Eastern border- land ethos. The publication of Mickiewicz's Ballads and Romances (Ballady i romanse) in 1822 marked the first stage in mythologizing individual provincial locali- ties, and local Lithuanian and Belorussian toponymy has ever since evoked in the Polish reader a frisson of apprehension, the intimation of life's meta- physical dimension. Mackiewicz notes place names matter-of-factly, like a logbook-keeper or a parish scribe. In his sweeping tour of a land that like the Shtetl (Ertel, 300) belongs no longer to space but to time, he has merely adduced proof of existence and makes a last entry in the land register pend- ing Doomsday. The mythologies of provincial localities are thus superseded. Though subservient to the narrative, landscape nevertheless retains full autonomy as a value in its own right. It has been argued that Mackiewicz's use of anthropomorphism in describing the natural scene is the tool of a rhetoric that seeks to persuade, and therefore pertains more to the eigh- teenth-century conte philosophique than to poetry (Tomaszewski). For Mackie- wicz, the only "message" of the natural order is territorial attachment, and patriotism of the landscape (Clearwayfor the Left, 372). It is as a defender of the natural order and its organic development that he becomes homo politicus polemicus. The landscape is there not to illustrate a political thesis or tract, but rather to highlight that ideology and politics, and those who seek to impose uniformity on what is by definition unique are in essence anti-nature. In the shadow of Soplicowo, Mickiewicz's successors had created closed, parochial microcosms, that were economically and politically threatened, but emotionally and axiologically self-sufficient, and where the dominant tonality is that of the idyll. Mackiewicz's landscape of open horizons, the terrain of army halts and bivouacs, has an intrinsic lyrical value connected with man's longing for the transcendental. It cannot however allow for the idyll. Mackiewicz's fictional world in fact reflects its demise. Pastoralism and the idyll of gentry life are precluded both by literary aesthetics and the new sociological reality. The few landed estates mentioned in the early chapters of Clearway for the Left are sketched without indul- gence or even conviction. Mackiewicz's manner likewise fails to satisfy the requirements of the idyll of provincial life. Stability and rootedness are pre-empted by war. The Road to Nowhere is, rather, the tragedy of the uprooted and the displaced (Grynberg).</page><page sequence="9">198 Slavic and East European Journal Similarly, Wilno is no longer the city of mystical martyrology and heroic bygone splendor. In Mackiewicz's narrative, it is stripped not only of its historic majesty, but of the poetry inherent in its natural lay-out and urban architecture, celebrated by decades of poetry and prose (Klos, Przeidziecki, Stolzman; also Milosz, Zniewolony and Rodzinna). The image of grey houses, sidestreets and alleyways, the suppressed rhythm of life under successive occupations, has more in common with the anonymous borderland town- ship of Mackiewicz's The Careerist (Karierowicz, 1955) than with the irra- diant, effulgent city enshrined in the national legend. Mackiewicz's Wilno is scarcely recognizable as the academic Arcadia of Mickiewicz's youth, or of Milosz's student days among his poet colleagues of the 2agary group. Here it is only fair to note that the latters' intellectual idyll of the early thirties went hand in hand with premonitions of the apocalypsis in store. A further myth discarded by Mackiewicz is that of the Eastern borderland population's differentia specifica. The inhabitants of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania in no way differ from their opposite numbers in the West. In other words, there is no distinction in the "characters" of nations, only in their environment and upbringing. This amounts to a rejection of the long gallery of eccentric, hospitable, garrulous, god-fearing, honorable, kindly types with which the Eastern borderland has traditionally supplied Polish literature over the last couple of centuries. Uncensored, unembellished, unidealized, Mackiewicz's Lithuania is no paradise, lost or regained. Even before the catastrophe, it was no promised land, nor land of the chosen. In the last year before the outbreak of war, his reportage of "second-class Poland" (or Polska B, as it was called) entitled Marshland Rebellion points to the social, political, and economic injustices undermining the social fabric.7 One is entitled to wonder what is the part played by Mackiewicz in the propagation of the Lithuanian myth, which undoubtedly continues to thrive in Poland today. It operates alongside a number of mythical systems that function within the Polish mentality and behavior pattern: the oldest of these, the historical legend of the foundation of the Polish state-Wanda and Krak, Popiel and Piast: the Ukrainian myth; and the myth of Poland's Galician past, characterized by nostalgia for the Habsburg world and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (Heck; Odojewski; Beauvois, Le Noble; Wie- gandt; Kuiniewicz [in Painiewski]; Kolbuszewski). Within this context, the Lithuanian dream experienced by Pan Mareczek in Jaroslaw Marek Rym- kiewicz's Polish Conversations in the Summer of 1983 (Rozmowy polskie latem 1983, 1984) is the verbalization of a fairly widespread phenomenon. In the collective subconscious of the Poles, the Lithuanian vision exists on</page><page sequence="10">The Lost Land of Lithuania: J6zef Mackiewicz 199 the level of dreams, creating a state of permanent spiritual and aesthetic longing and nostalgia. It provides a safe place for a certain form of thera- peutic escapism, with a considerable potential for renewal, for spiritual res- toration and aesthetic inspiration. Rooted mainly in the reception and aesthetic perception of Mickiewicz, Milosz, and Konwicki, the Lithuanian myth is syncretic, consolatory, and compensatory. It represents the search for a lost homeland and for roots, a quest for national and individual identity, a longing for Arcadia. It concerns axiological space. It stands for an organic life and an integrated organic social hierarchy. And because it is identified with the life of these writers, it is an area in which the literary imagination can safely graze. Mackiewicz's prospectus of life and landscape in Polish Lithuania and his demolition of literary stereotypes do not fit the popular vision. He has been called a man of extremes, in whose soul the artist and the fighter coexisted in awkward symbiosis (Terlecki, Speech). There is incongruity, or even conflict, in the situation of an artist caught between the dictates of the 6migr6 stance, the scope afforded by undoctored history and other fringe benefits of exile, and the aesthetic blueprint provided by Mickiewicz. For Mackiewicz has demythologized the traditional borderland idyll by means of a programmatic and verifiable anti-pastoralism; and has thereby rehisto- ricized the Grand Duchy. He has created his own brand of epic out of deliberately unheroic stances, and lyricism out of an often drab reality. By revealing the face of Lithuania that Mickiewicz wittingly-or unwit- tingly-concealed, and that only partially emerges in the lyrical realism of Syrokomla and Orzeszkowa's idylls, Mackiewicz comes nearest to the anti- myth that underlines the official icon. Within the orbit of Mickiewicz, he offers the antithesis of Soplicowo. The assessment of Mackiewicz's contribution to a "Lithuanian" awareness in Poland today is in any case complicated by problems of circulation and reception.8 It may however be noted that among functions of the borderland ethos he has retained the autonomy of nature: its value on the metaphysical, moral, and ideological plane has already been mentioned. Further reference should be made to the spatial layout, and the use of landscape and topogra- phy as structural axis (see Orzeszkowa's Eli Makower and On the Banks of the Niemen; Weyssenhoff's The Union, The Sable and the Maiden, and The Forest). Subjugated to the dynamics of action, landscape and topography are structurally central to his novels. The main focal position is occupied by Wilno, which provides the chief spatial axis of the action even in The Colonel Miasojedow Affair, Mackiewicz's novel on the Russian Empire, as the place of romance, and later of refuge, to which the action returns at three crucial points in the plot. The territory of Polish Lithuania provides not only the structural center. It is also the sole source of lyrical inspiration and affections. It provides the</page><page sequence="11">200 Slavic and East European Journal basis of knowledge about God and man, history and morality. It is the center of existence, the only real world and the ultimate criterion of values. Certainly, for emigre writers hailing from a region of racial, national, cul- tural, and denominational pluralism, the benefits to be derived from contact with alien and exotic cultures are at best dubious. The aura of barren indif- ference, inhumanity, and deceit that emanates from Mackiewicz's town- scapes of Western Europe in Miasojedow and Don't Tell It Out Loud further emphasizes this point. The Lithuanian vision as presented by J6zef Mackiewicz concerns the metaphysical level, spiritual spaciousness, and human pluralism. Like the Habsburg model, it represents an axiological model of culture and civiliza- tion. It guarantees an independent spiritual stance, a declaration of faith in a system of permanent values other than those served on an ad hoc basis by would-be legislators, administrators, and conformists. It voices moreover an obsession with cultural pluralism in a totalitarian society. The literature of the Grand Duchy is anti-totalitarian, and anti-nationalistic. Its identity is Tatar, Jewish, Belorussian, Karaim, Baltic Lithuanian, and Polish. Like the Habsburg model, it reflects an European awareness, the awareness that the issue at stake is not individual chauvinism, but European culture. As such, it comes closer to expressing an European ideal than the literature of the Polish center. Paradoxically, it is by all but killing the fairy-tale of Lithuania and its latent potential for magic that Mackiewicz has most expanded its possibilities. Out of the wreck of his childhood world, he has created a pragmatic, secular program turned towards the world, and to the future. NOTES * Born in 1902 in St. Petersburg, where his father was a successful wine merchant, and educated at the Vinogradov Gymnasium in Wilno, J6zef Mackiewicz took part in the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1919-20, and studied natural sciences at the University in Warsaw. In the interwar period he worked as a reporter on the Wilno daily Slowo, of which his brother Stanislaw Cat-Mackiewicz was editor. In 1939-40 he co-edited Gazeta Codzienna, which preconized the restoration of Jagiellonian ideas and the solidarity of all the nationalities inhabiting the territories of the historic Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During the Soviet occupation he worked as a carter and woodcutter. After the war, in London and then in Munich, he contributed extensively to the Polish emigre press. An anti- communist on humanist rather than political grounds, Mackiewicz authored several polemical books in which he criticized the comportment of the Western Allies during World War II, attacked the Vatican's East European policies, and succeeded in being at odds with most of the opinion-forming elites of the Polish emigracja: he was more than once the object of attack and controversy. At the same time he entertained deep reserva- tions about the independent Catholic press, Oppositionist activities, and the Solidarity movement in People's Poland, where he is currently (and posthumously) recognized as one of the foremost writers of prose fiction in the postwar period. When he died in 1985</page><page sequence="12">The Lost Land of Lithuania: J6zef Mackiewicz 201 his widow, the poet and novelist Barbara Toporska, stipulated that in Poland his books should be reissued only by the independent publishing houses. 1 The Polish emigr6 syndrome and its literary expression are perceptively analyzed by Jarzebski. 2 Their main works are: Pawlikowski: Dziecinistwo i mtodoc' Tadeusza Irten'skiego (1959), Wojna i sezon (1965), Brudne niebo (1971); Czarnyszewicz: Nadberezynicy (1942), Wicik Zywica (1953), Losy pasierbdw (1958), Chlopcy z Nowoszyszek (1963); Piasecki: Kochanek Wielkiej Niediwiedzicy (1937), Bogom nocy rdwni (1938), Jabtuszko (1946), Nikt nie da nam zbawienia (1947), Siedem pigulek Lucyfera (1948), Zapiski oficera Armii Czerwonej (1957), Zywot cztowieka rozbrojonego (1962), Cztowiek przemieniony w wikla (1964), Dla honoru organizacji (1964); Tro'cianko: Wiek mrski (1970), Wiek kl4ski (1971). 3 The first Polish novel written in exile was Czarnyszewicz's monumental Nadberezynicy (Berezyna Riverfolk), which came out in Argentina as early as 1942. 4 See in particular Konwicki's novels of partisan warfare Rojsty (1956), Sennik wsp6dczgsny (1963), and Nic albo nic (1971). The Lithuanian "landscape of childhood" is the main focus of Dziura w niebie (1959), Zwierzoczlekoupidr (1969), and Kronika wypadk6w milos- nych (1974). jakiewicz's principal works on the Lithuanian theme are Rod Abacz6w (1968) and Wilcze tqki (1982). 5 Although Mackiewicz presents the broadest panorama, Czarnyszewicz in Berezyna River Folk reaches back to the period prior to World War I (of which there are faint echoes in Milosz's Issa Valley), then proceeds through the occupation of the Minsk area in 1918-19 and the Polish-Bolshevik war. These are also given full-blooded treatment by Piasecki, while the successive occupations of Wilno during World War II provide the subject of his last two novels. 6 Orzeszkowa: Eli Makower (1875) and particularly Nad Niemnem (1888); Weyssenhoff's "Lithuanian triptych" comprising Unja (1909), Sob6l i Panna (1911), and Puszcza (1914). 7 This is the main aspect of Marshland Rebellion to be emphasized in an unsigned review in Czas, 11 February 1938. 8 Mackiewicz's reception in Poland was the subject of a paper by Waclaw Lewandowski, "Recepcja tw6rczo'ci J6zefa Mackiewicza w Kraju" delivered at the conference of young Polish literature scholars held at the Catholic University of Lublin on 4-7 May 1987; see Przeglqd Powszechny, 1987, no. 11:297.
