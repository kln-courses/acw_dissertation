<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature and Language: A Commentary Paul de Man HENEVER QUESTIONS about the language of literature, about the distinctiveness of literary language, are being asked, some predictable difficulties occur. It is quite pos- sible to describe a certain type of literary language with more than adequate precision, as Cyril Birch does in his article on Chinese litera- ture or, to some extent, Isaac Rabinowitz in his study on the language of the Old Testament-although, in the latter case, ominous questions are very close to making their appearance over the horizon of the text. But this works only as long as one describes the species without getting too close to the genus: taking for granted there is such a thing as "literary language," one can describe a particular subset of the class, but as soon as one confronts the question of defining the specificity of literary language as such, complications arise. The more theoretical among the studies on literature and language published in this and in recent issues of New Literary History should allow us to speculate on the systematization of this difficulty. The juxtaposition of these essaysI reveals a recurrent narrative pattern that may well be more than a mere result of chance or a com- monplace of academic exposition: all of the essays suggest that the study of literary language could progress if only we could rid our- selves of misconceptions that have hampered it persistently in the past. The tone is one of impatience with recurrent errors of definition: "It is evident," writes Seymour Chatman, "that stylistics, like linguistics before it, must rid itself of normative preoccupations if it is ever to get i The commentary is based on most of the articles published in this issue of New Literary History and on the following earlier essays: Michael Riffaterre, "The Stylistic Approach to Literary History"; Stanley Fish, "Literature in the Reader: Affective Stylistics" (both in NLH, 2 [1970]); Seymour Chatman, "On Defining 'Form'" (NLH, 2 [1971]). The articles in this issue (The Language of Literature) are so diverse that no inclusive commentary could possibly do them justice. I have preferred therefore to narrow down the choice of illustrative material to the smallest number of articles possible, at the risk of leaving out outstanding contributions. Their inclusion would have extended the commentary beyond reasonable proportions.</page><page sequence="2">182 NEW LITERARY HISTORY around to the task of describing its object"2 (my italics). Michael Riffaterre can see no other obstacle to the natural cooperation between literary history and textual analysis (a cooperation which, he says, "has remained largely unexplored") than the reluctance of the his- torians to realize that "texts are made up of words, not things or ideas."3 Stanley Fish is eager to get under way with a method of which he claims that "it works," 4 but he first has to clear the decks of a number of obstacles such as Wimsatt, Beardsley, Richards, Empson, and, as it happens, Riffaterre. The stance is dramatized most intensely in the prose of George Steiner. He has few doubts about the specificity of literary language; no dialectical complexities mar his assertion that in reading literature "we are implicated in a matrix of inexhausti- ble specificity."5 If he seems perhaps slightly less sanguine than the others about the prospects of a science of literature, this is only because the literary work stands glorified in a semidivine status of inaccessible perfection. Provided only we can get rid of universalist aberrations that pretend to see connections between literary and ordinary language, linguists, critics, and social scientists can unite in a joint effort that may elevate us towards the exalted level of the world's literary master- pieces. The same basic story underlies all of these essays. None of the authors speak as if they merely had to perform a straightforward, un- hampered task of description or understanding. All have to set out against an erroneous conception of literature that stands in their way. This is certainly not because they happen to be a particularly aggressive or self-satisfied group of people: all are eminently fair and respectful of their predecessors. It seems to be in the nature of the question that it has to be asked against previous answers that first have to be shown to be aberrant before the proper definition of literary language can be stated. The nature of this obstacle varies to the point of diametrical op- position, but in a manner that defies easy systematization. For Rif- faterre (at least in this article), literature is static and monumental: "the text . . . is unchanging"6; "the more of a monument it is . . . the more literary"'7; and it is the task of stylistics to rescue this 2 Chatrnan, p. 220. 3 Riffaterre, p. 39. 4 Fish, p.

But for Stanley Fish, there can be no greater aberration than thus to reduce a text to the monumental objectivity of a static entity: "The objectivity of the text," he writes, "is an illusion, and moreover, a dangerous illusion, because it is so physically convincing. The illusion is one of self-sufficiency and completeness .. ." 8 His entire effort is directed towards substituting the dynamics of reading, conceived as a successive act in time, to the immobilism of mere description.9 For Steiner, the major obstacle to literary studies stems from whatever puts into question the ineffable specificity of a work that is totally self- sufficient and self-identical in the radical difference that separates it from anything that is not itself; whereas Seymour Chatman and Josephine Miles are looking instead for "classes of elements which under their surface differences can provide patterns of sustaining likeness." 10 The question of the linguistic specificity of literature is equally divided: universalists like Riffaterre insist on the uniqueness of literature as opposed to ordinary language in hierarchical terms to which a particularist like Steiner could subscribe, whereas Miles and Chatman tend to erase the borderlines between literature and ordinary speech, a position also vigorously defended by Fish (against Riffaterre) who, on the other hand, has little sympathy for the intrinsic formalism of stylistic or structuralist methods. The spatial metaphor of intrinsic/ extrinsic (inside/outside) literary methods is not more consistent: Riffaterre's traditional historical philologism, based on erudition and factual information, is extrinsic, whereas for Fish, the act of reading is an intratextual event between two successive moments in the temporal constitution of an understanding. Steiner's organic totaliza- tions allow for no inconsistencies or intrusions coming from the outside -he lines up with Fish on this point-whereas Chatman's insistence on content and on message gives his work an undeniably extrinsic flavor. Isolating only these eight relatively simple (and, of course, not un- related) polarities-static/dynamic, universal/particular, privileged/ ordinary, inside/outside-we find no consistency: the polarities are distributed in what seems to be a random pattern, suggesting that none of these antithetical pairs possess a decisive authority. The actual con- tent of the antinomies seems to be less important than the formal necessity of their existence. The texts draw their energy from tensions 8 Fish, p. 140. 9 In his discussion of Riffaterre, Stanley Fish's characterization of the latter's dynamics of reading (see Fish, pp. 156-57), based on "Criteria for Style Analysis" (Word, I5 [1959]), is actually a great deal subtler than the categorical assertion of monumentality in Riffaterre's article published in the same issue of NLH.

They imply a fundamental misreading of litera- ture which is always, systematically, a misreading performed by others." If one accepts this complication as a purely formal pattern, without going into the specific merits and demerits of each individual position, it would follow that the specificity of literary language resides in the possibility of misreading and misinterpretation. We realize this all the more strongly when passing from the critical parts of the articles -with which it is, in general, quite easy to agree-to the parts in which the authors propose their own corrected readings. As soon as this happens, we feel inclined to find them in error together with the writers they have been censoring. One experiences little difficulty fol- lowing Fish in his criticism of Richards, Riffaterre in his assault on literal-minded historians, Chatman in his strictures on Barthes, or Steiner in his admonitions to Chomsky. But as soon as they offer their own readings, our own critical sense reawakens. The critique's deserve the treatment they get at the hands of the critiquants, but the latter turn at once into critique's in their own right without in the least re- deeming their original targets. We are entirely willing to accept what has by now grown into a double pattern of juxtaposed aberration. When Riffaterre, for example (singled out for no other reason than that the example he uses happens to be in a field with which I am familiar), in his reading of Baudelaire's poem "Boh6miens en voyage,"12 denies any relevance to the Callot etchings which served as a model for the poem, the temptation to disagree with him is irresistible. How can he claim that the Callot work is merely an "exercise in the picturesque" when, for Baudelaire, Callot, the inspirer of E. T. A. Hoffmann, rates with Goya, Breughel, Constantin Guys, and other revered names as a representative of the highest "philosophi- cal art" and a practitioner of an aesthetics of absolute irony? 13 How can he fail to see the impact that Callot's background-presence in the poem is bound to have on the concluding lines which, according to Riffaterre, the reader is "free to interpret as Death or cosmic mys- tery"? 14 How can he find an opposition between Callot and the Quest i Lest this be misconstrued as a criticism, let me hasten to point out that the same observation also applies to this brief commentary. 12 Riffaterre, pp. 41-42. I3 The main references to Callot in Baudelaire are in the well-known essays "De L'essence du rire" and "L'art philosophique." I4 Riffaterre, p. 42. The last lines of the poem speak of ".... ces voyageurs, pour lesquels est ouvert / L'empire familier des t6nebres futures."</page><page sequence="5">LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE: A COMMENTARY 185 theme, when it is Callot himself who introduced the prophetic, future- oriented dimension from the start? 15 How can he so peremptorily separate the source's genetic from its allusive function in a case when the transposition from one medium (painting) into another (poetry), always a crucial event in Baudelaire, makes the juxtaposition par- ticularly delicate and complex? My point is not to disagree with Michael Riffaterre on the exegesis of a specific Baudelaire text; I merely want to demonstrate how his remarks, by their very pertinence, allow for the immediate eclosion of a critical counterdiscourse which (if I had been uncautious enough to develop it fully) it would not be difficult to subject, in its turn, to a similar inquisition, to another turn of the critical screw.16 Similar observations could be made about each of the essays. They leave us confronted with a self-defeating situation. How are literary studies ever to get started when every proposed method seems based on a misreading and a misconceived preconception about the nature of literary language? The next step, obviously, will have to reflect on the nature and status of these misreadings. But, on this point, our authors are curiously uninformative: they argue vigorously and effec- tively against the specific substantial issue they reject, but have little to say about the reasons that have so persistently misled the other critics. Why have historians been, for centuries, so dull-witted that they failed to realize the obvious fact that poems are made of words? Why do writers on literature keep so stubbornly returning to irrelevant value judgments? Riffaterre and Chatman have nothing to tell us on this point. It seems obvious to them that once the proper methodological assumptions have been made, a correct reading, or a controlled set of readings, will ensue. The difficulty of reading, for nearly all of these authors (with the possible exception of Stanley Fish), when it is men- tioned at all, exists at most as a contingent, never as a constitutive obstacle to literary understanding. 15 Interestingly enough in two lines of verse inscribed on the etching: "Ces pauvres gueux pleins de bonadventures / Ne portent rien que des choses futures." Obviously, Callot does not account for all the details in the poem which combines various allusive strands. But the semantic impact of these allusive configurations is distorted if Callot is excluded from consideration. The Callot source of the poem was pointed out as early as 1919 by Antoine Adam. I6 This countercriticism undermines the methodological foundations of the read- ing it attacks. We can hardly believe in Riffaterre's assertion that the literary work consists of an "immutable code" bound to elicit a definite response in the reader if we can legitimately put in question all the readings he suggests and if he himself, when confronted with a crucial line in which the two readings differ literally as life differs from death, is forced to leave the reader "free to interpret" as he pleases.</page><page sequence="6">186 NEW LITERARY HISTORY In this particular respect, the articles are by no means atypical of literary studies as they are practiced today. The systematic avoidance of the problem of reading, of the interpretative or hermeneutic moment, is a general symptom shared by all methods of literary analysis, whether they be structural or thematic, formalist or referential, American or European, apolitical or socially committed. It is as if an organized conspiracy made it anathema to raise the question, perhaps because the vested interests in literary studies as a respectable intellectual discipline are at stake or perhaps for more ominous reasons. As for the critics who are interested in the theory of interpretation, their main task seems to be to reassure at all costs their more pragmatically or more formalistically oriented colleagues about the self-evident possibility of achieving correct readings. This is hardly the place to offer alternatives or to speculate on the origin of difficulties that are implicitly recognized but not openly stated in these articles. I would instead like to follow up the argument of the papers that come closest to entering into the orbit of the question that is being systematically avoided. There is some interest in isolating the moment when the writers recoil before the evidence they have pro- duced. What would happen beyond this moment, if they had chosen to continue on their course, is another story, with a scenario that would have to differ somewhat from the recurrent plot shared by all of them. It would at any rate have to include as a visible articulation this moment of recoil that now unwittingly gets written into some of the essays. I can take space for two examples only. Starting out from German philosophical traditions and from Slavic studies of linguistic form, Henryk Markiewicz17 offers a succinct but precise set of properties whose existence is a necessary condition for "literariness." These prop- erties are (i) fictionality (the possible absence, in literary discourse, of an empirical referent), (2) figurality (the presence of representational or nonrepresentational tropes), and (3) what Markiewicz, with refer- ence to Jakobson, calls "superimposed ordering," i.e., principles of linguistic choice guided by considerations that are not purely referential, as when a word is preferred to a synonym for phonetic rather than semantic reasons. The obvious advantage of this terminology over traditionally expressive or aesthetic characterizations of literature resides in a precision that gives at least an illusion of objectivity, of responsible reference to identifiable linguistic facts. But is this really the case? Markiewicz's primarily historical argument tries to show that the 17 Henryk Markiewicz, "The Limits of Literature," NLH, this issue, pp. 5-14.</page><page sequence="7">LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE: A COMMENTARY 187 presence of a single one of these "properties" suffices to confer a degree of literariness on any discourse and that it is not necessary to have all three of them simultaneously present; he is clearly treating his three categories as distinct properties of language, as distinct from each other as red is distinct from green, or acidity from sweetness. But if we translate the three terms back into the rhetorical modes of which they are the conceptualization, a less clear-cut model is revealed. Fictionality, as discussed by Markiewicz, is clearly another term for mimesis; figurality is directly, and with a helpful reference to Hegel, identified as metaphor. As for "superimposed ordering," the mention of Jakobson labels it as paranomasis, the pairing or combining of words on a phonetic basis (as in rhyme, assonance, or alliteration). Mimesis, metaphor, and paranomasis all are, of course, rhetorical figures; when Markiewicz therefore, near the end of his essay, asks whether "it is indeed possible to find a common denominator for the three char- acterizations of 'literariness' . . . ," then a first and obvious answer to this question would be that rhetoric considered as a property of lan- guage, or "rhetoricity," constitutes this common denominator. But can rhetoricity be called a definite property that, in Markiewicz's words, would "justify . .. an objective relationship between words described as literary, and indirectly justify also a relative unity of the subject matter of literary studies"? As anyone who has ever consulted a treatise of rhetoric will testify, it is notoriously difficult, logically as well as his- torically, to keep the various tropes and figures rigorously apart, to establish precisely when catachresis becomes metaphor and when metaphor turns into metonymy; to quote an apt water-metaphor to which an expert in the field has to resort precisely in his discussion of metaphor: "the transition (of one figure to another, in this case, from metaphor to metonymy) is fluid." 18 And the three figures picked by Markiewicz are particularly redoubtable: paranomasis can be con- sidered as one special, sound-based case of metaphor in which the phonic resemblance at least intimates the possibility of a substitution on the level of substance. And metaphor can be considered as an imitation (which is how Markiewicz, perhaps mistakenly, understands mimesis) in which the tenor imitates the vehicle or, to use another terminology, the literal meaning imitates the figural meaning on the basis of a common resemblance to a third term of comparison. One could and should pursue this discussion at length, but enough has perhaps been said to suggest that the three terms overlap to such an extent that it makes little sense to speak of any of them being present 18 Heinrich Lausberg, Handbuch der literarischen Rhetorik (Munich, 1960), ? 571, p. 295: "Der Obergang von der Metonymis zur Metapher ist fliessend ..</page><page sequence="8">188 NEW LITERARY HISTORY at the exclusion of the other. More important still, each of the terms is highly ambiguous in its own right. Each has the possibility of misread- ing built into its own constitution; they can indeed be said to be the conceptual denomination of this possibility. To start with imitation, Markiewicz denies that fictionality can be called a universal char- acteristic of literature by invoking the case of memoirs and letters as opposed to novels: are we to infer from this that everything stated in memoirs or in letters is true and that novels are made up exclusively of lies? Mimesis can be said to imply a referential vqrification as well as to dodge it; the only thing that can be stated with certainty is that it allows for the confusion between the two choices. As for metaphor, the mischief wrecked by this wiliest of Pandora's boxes defies the chal- lenge of trying to evoke it in a few words; the one example mentioned by Markiewicz, Hegel's distinction between "eigentliche Verbild- lichung" and "uneigentliche Verbildlichung" (literal and figural representation) leads directly into the infinitely deceiving epistemology of representation and into the innumerable ways in which it is possible to confuse images and things. The dangerously seductive powers of paranomasis are easier to convey. We only have to remind ourselves that Jakobson based his discussion of the figure on the phonetic analysis of the slogan "I like Ike"; euphony is probably the most insidious of all sources of error. By merely following up Markiewicz's own cate- gories, we reach the conclusion that the determining characteristic of literary language is indeed figurality, in the somewhat wider sense of rhetoricity, but that, far from constituting an objective basis for literary study, rhetoric implies the persistent threat of misreading. Whether it also implies the impossibility of truthful reading could hardly be decided in the space of a few sentences. Markiewicz's brief but sug- gestive essay provides categories and a terminology by means of which this investigation could proceed, but concludes in the illusion of a false precision at the very moment when it has in fact revealed the inevitability of confusion. Of all the essays considered in this commentary, the one closest to treating reading explicitly as a problem is Stanley Fish's "Literature in the Reader: Affective Stylistics." For Fish, the utterance of meaning cannot be separated from the process by means of which this meaning is reached or, stated more radically, meaning can only be the narrative of this temporal process and cannot be reduced to statement. "An observation about the [literary] sentence as an utterance-its refusal to yield a declarative statement-_has been transformed into an account of its experience (not being able to get a fact out of it). It is no longer an object, a thing-in-itself, but an event, something that happens to,</page><page sequence="9">LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE: A COMMENTARY 189 and with the participation of, the reader. And it is this event, this hap- pening.. . that is, I would argue, the meaning of the sentence." 19 The merits of the position are clearly in evidence in the examples discussed in the article: we are freed at last from the tedious business of para- phrase and from the less tedious but mystified practice of thematic reconstruction and rearrangement. What we are offered instead is certainly much closer to the actual event of literary understanding. The question must arise, however, what the truth value of such a narrative can be and whether one can afford to be as unworried about this as Fish seems to be. His reading-stories unquestionably contain many episodes of aberration and deceit: "what the sentence does is give the reader something and then take it away, drawing him on with the unredeemed promise of its return"; "the two negatives combine... to prevent the reader from making the simple (declarative) sense which would be the goal of a logical analysis"; "that construction . . . pressures the reader to perform exactly those mental operations whose propriety the statement of the sentence-what it is saying-is challeng- ing,"'20 etc. The relationship between author and reader is a highly dramatic one, but it tells a rather sordid story in which the reader is manipulated and exploited by a callous author who, in the course of a few random quotations, appears as an evil counselor, a temptor who fails to deliver the goods, and, above all, as a falsifier of truth. The reason why this sorry situation is allowed to develop is not because the category of meaning has been undermined but because it has been displaced: the author himself, rather than the referent of the statement, now seems to be the sole depository of meaning. He can play with the reader as a cat plays with a mouse because, being in full control of his own meaning, he can conceal and reveal it at his discretion. We are told, for example, that Pater's sentence "deliberately frustrates the reader's natural desire to organize the particulars it offers" and the dynamics of reading are persistently referred to as a "strategy" or as an "effect.'21 The same self-confidence is present in the felicitous formulation of Fish's own critical procedure. The read- ing-stories he tells are true because they are given to us by an author in full control of his language. By tracing back the meandering thread I19 Fish, p. I125. 20 Fish, pp. I25, I26, I33. 21 ". .. what makes problematical sense as a statement makes perfect sense as a strategy, as an action made upon a reader" (Fish, p. I24); "In my account of read- ing.., the temporary adoption of these inappropriate strategies is itself a response to the strategy of an author; and the resulting mistakes are part of the experience provided by that author's language and therefore part of the meaning" (p. I44), etc.</page><page sequence="10">190 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of the writer's strategies, we recover the totality of the literary experi- ence which was only temporarily hidden from us. "Analysis in terms of doings and happenings is . . . truly objective because it recognizes the fluidity, 'the movingness,' of the meaning experience and because it directs us to where the action is-the active and activating con- sciousness of the reader." Reading is no real problem because it coin- cides with the successive unfolding of its own process. It traces the trajectory of its own truth, "the developing responses of the reader to the words as they succeed one another on the page" or "the temporal left to right reception of the verbal string." Like Riffaterre, Fish can promise that, by following this "verbal string" into the labyrinth of the text, "I am able to chart and project the developing response" (Fish's own italics). The critic shares the same fundamental self- assurance with the author-who perhaps borrowed it from him in the first place. I may have overstated Fish's assurance, for his text has its share of reservations and ambivalences with regard to its own doctrine. It is, for example, never clear whether the concealment and complication of meaning emanates from the author, considered as a conscious sub- ject, or from the (his?) text. Fish carefully states that Pater's "sentence deliberately frustrates . . ." or that errors are forced upon the reader by the "author's language" (my italics), which is presumably not quite the same as Pater or the author doing these things themselves. On the other hand, his commitment to the dramatics of action compels him to make these ambivalent subjects (centaurs that are half-man, half- text) into the grammatical subjects of transitive verbs that perform highly anthropomorphic gestures. It is impossible to speak of a text as performing strategically without projecting into it the metaphor of an intentional consciousness or subject. No trace in Fish's text suggests that the possibility of such an unwarranted metaphorization is ever being considered, let alone dominated. Yet it dominates his own dis- course throughout, as is apparent, among other things, from his choice of examples. The first two examples, which set the tone,22 deal with lines from Thomas Browne and Milton centered on Judas and on Satan, and each of these lines, as Fish convincingly demonstrates, casts doubt on whether the evildoers perceived the gravity of their own plight. There is only one other character in the essay whose behavior bears a close resemblance to these Satanic models: if the authors are indeed as deliberate and responsible as Fish makes them out to be, they can be 22 The examples are amplified rather than contradicted by the other examples from Pater and Plato.</page><page sequence="11">LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE: A COMMENTARY I 91 charged with the gravest sins in Hell, including the betrayal of their benefactors, the readers. But the passages that have been selected assert the impossibility of passing judgment because the evidence of guilt, either by Scriptural authority or by the inner voice of conscience, cannot be ascertained. Within the inner logic of Fish's argument, the examples thus reveal the utter bewilderment of the author before his own text: did he, or did he not know what he was saying? No one can tell, neither reader nor author. The author is ahead of the reader only in the knowledge of his impossibility, but, by his very utterance, he reduces the reader to the same condition of ignorance. It is doubtful whether the conveyance of this negative insight could still be called an act, let alone a process. And it is equally doubtful whether this no-act can be represented by a geometrical line ("verbal string") or by a narrative that lays claim to mimetic veracity. Neither reading nor writing resemble action; both tend to fuse in their common deviation from referential models, whether they be things, acts, or feelings. The ideal reader is the author himself, because he does not share the illusions of the naive reader-in this case Stanley Fish-about the writer's authority. Fish's own text infers this, although it reduces his methodological claims to nought. To place Plato's Phaedrus at the center of an essay on the rhetoric of reading, to read it correctly as a radical deconstruction of the truth of all literary texts, and then to go on to claim of one's own critical discourse that it will "chart and project the developing response" in a "truly objective way" is making things almost too easy for the critical commentator. Or is it perhaps a not-so-naive gesture of self-defense? Stanley Fish has more than glimpsed the implications of the Phaedrus, of the poetic texts he quotes, and of his own critique of thematic and structural semanticism. Reflecting apologetically on the one-sidedness of his examples, he remarks that "perhaps literature is what disturbs our sense of self-sufficiency, personal and linguistic," a formulation that, in the final analysis, spells the end of criticism as a scientific mode of discourse. But he immediately retreats from such implications: "the result [of thus defining literature] would probably be more a reflection of personal psychological need than of a universally true aesthetic."23 The only need that can be at play here is that of not seeing the universal negativity of what then can no longer be called an aesthetics of litera- ture, and this need is neither personal nor psychological. Later in the article, the same unavoidable threat of semantic nihilism is again perceived: "Nothing is [the meaning]. Perhaps, then, the word mean- 23 Fish, p. 147.</page><page sequence="12">192 NEW LITERARY HISTORY ing should also be discarded . " 24 But this speculative moment is also at once repressed by substituting a regressive notion of unmediated "experience" for meaning and by a curiously primitivistic statement about experience being "immediately compromised the moment you say anything about it," a pseudoelegiac theme which, despite its assumed hostility towards language, has generated even more words than the wars of Troy. The systematic avoidance of reading is not a time- or place-bound phenomenon characteristic of American formalist criticism in the early seventies. The double movement of revelation and recoil will always be inherent in the nature of a genuine critical discourse; its presence in these essays bears witness to their vitality. It can appear in infinitely varied versions and this diversity creates the possibility of a history of critical trends and movements. In the case of most of these articles, the particular obstacle that interferes with reading stems from a wish- ful confusion between the analytical rigor of the exegetic procedure and the epistemological authority of the ensuing results.
