<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bh?sma and Hesiod's Succession Myth Nicholas J. Alton This paper, like Nicholas Allen (1998), belongs to the field of research that I call "Indo-European cultural comparativism," but while the earlier paper took off from a comparison between the Mah?bh?rata and Homer's Odyssey, this one turns to Homer's approximate contemporary, Hesiod. The assumption is again that if similarities between the Sanskrit and the Greek narratives are sufficiently numerous, detailed, and well structured, they then indicate a common origin, possibly in a narrative that was already current at the time when the languages separated. During many centuries of oral transmission the "protonarrative" would have diverged or branched, alongside the languages in which it was expressed. The Sanskrit narrative studied here centers on Bh?sma and comes primarily from Book 1 of the Mah?bh?rata, especially minor parvans 6-7. In the Critical Edition these occupy adhy?yas 54-123, but only about a dozen chapters will be closely relevant. As for Hesiod, his Theogony (Birth of the Gods) is a poem of 1,022 lines, of which the last hundred or so are often judged to be a later addition. It was written down, in roughly the same meter and diction as the two Homeric epics, Iliad and Odyssey, around 700 BCE. Interspersed among much genealogical matter, the poem tells the story of three gods linked by filiation? Ouranos, Kronos, and Zeus?each of whom dominates his own generation. The same story, with differences of detail, is covered by Apollodorus (first-second century CE) at the start of his compendium of Greek mythology (Bibliotheke 1.1-6).1 The story of the three gods has come to be known as the Succession Myth (West 1966) and is sometimes subsumed under the broader title "Kingship in Heaven" (Littleton 1970). The reason for exploring this particular comparison is that Bh?sma is the incarnation of Dyaus, and Dyaus is etymologically cognate with Zeus (both names, like that of Roman Jupiter, derive from a reconstructed *Dyeus [Polom?, International Journal of Hindu Studies 8,1-3 (2004): 57-79 ? 2005 by the World Heritage Press Inc.</page><page sequence="2">58 / Nicholas J. Allen Adams, and Mallory 1997]). Moreover, when it is not used as a theonym, dyaus means simply "sky, heaven," which is also the meaning of Greek ouranos. Since none of these facts is obscure or newly discovered, one might expect the Indo-European comparative literature to be unmanageably large, but it is not. This is partly because most Indo-European comparativists, being linguists by background rather than mythologists, focus on the earlier Vedas rather than on the later classical Sanskrit epic, and cultural comparativists are relatively few and marginal; but there may be a more specific reason. It is widely accepted among classicists (for example, Griffin 1986; Kirk 1974: 256; Walcot 1966; West 1997), in the light of Hittite, Syrian, and Mesopotamian material, that Hesiod's Succession Myth derives from non-Indo-European West Asia, and the conclusion has been accepted by some Indo-European mythologists (for example, Puhvei 1987: 24-31), though not by all (Sergent 1997: 334; Wikander 1952).2 The myth could of course combine motifs from different origins, as Dominique Briquel (1980) rightly notes, but the argument for a West Asian origin complicates the picture for Indo-European comparativists and may have inhibited curiosity. For comparativism involving Bh?sma the basic reference is Georges Dum?zil (1968: 176-90), which draws on an article of 1959 (reprinted, with retouches, as 2000: 169-88). As Dum?zil acknowledged, this work merely applied to Bh?sma the discovery made by the Indo-Iranian comparativist S tig Wikander in 1947 of the analytical importance of the links between individual P?nnava brothers and the gods of whom they are the children or incarnations.3 However, in the writings of his mature phase, Dum?zil avoided India-Greece comparisons (for reasons he explained in 1987: 157-66). In fact he regarded the etymological link between Dyaus and Zeus as disappointing for comparativists: "In Vedic Dyaus, the 4sky' is quite differently oriented from Greek Zeus or Roman Jupiter, and the rapprochement teaches us almost nothing" (1968: 11; my translation). Instead, his comparison linked Bh?sma with the Norse god Heimdall, focusing among other similarities on their respective birth stories. Although the comparison is convincing (pace Hiltebeitel 2001: 274n52), the present paper concentrates on the Sanskrit and Greek, barely alluding to the Scandinavian material; I also refer only briefly to the important topic of Bh?sma the matchmaker (Dum?zil 1979: 66-71). Dum?zil's general position is that stories about human agents in the Mah?bh?rata are transpositions of Vedic or pre-Vedic myths about deities? myths that may or may not survive in the Vedic literature we possess. Thus the Bh?sma-Heimdall similarities arise because Bh??ma is a transposition of Dyaus, who was cognate with the Norse god. We too will be exploring similarities between Sanskrit epic figures and non-Sanskrit deities, but now that similarities,</page><page sequence="3">Bh?sma and Hesiod's Succession Myth I 59 both of structure and detail, are beginning to accumulate between Indian and Greek heroes, there is less reason than previously to think in terms of a god-to man transposition occurring in India. In fact, since so much more evidence exists than can be mobilized here, I do not even try to decide whether the stories applied to gods before they applied to men. Similarly, fundamental though it is, and relevant in certain ways, I scarcely have space to mention three- or four functional theory (Allen 1999a). Writing in 1952, before Dum?zil's work on Bh?sma and Heimdail, Wikander proposed a brief but lucid comparison between the Greek and Hittite gods in the Succession Myth and three figures from the Iranian king-list?a comparison that merits further attention.4 The classicist-comparativist Dominique Briquel wrote three closely linked papers (1978, 1980, 1981) of which the second bears most closely on the Succession Myth. Briquel's papers rely heavily on Dum?zil's analysis (1968: 145-75) of Pan?u and his brothers in terms of the Mitra-Varu?a opposition and the theory of the "Minor Sovereigns," and a proper assessment of them would involve us in this murky topic, which lies outside my present scope. BH^MA AND ZEUS I start with the birth story of Bh?sma, son of Ganga and Samtanu (Figure 1), of which the epic provides two versions. G+5 G+4 G+3 G+2 G+i GO Suktimatl Girika 4- Adrik? I_ Ganga I?

The generations are numbered from the point of view of the central Pa??ava protagonist.</page><page sequence="4">60 / Nicholas J. Allen Both versions are told by Vaisarrip?yana, but the second, the shorter, is told via the words of Ganga, when she responds to a question asked by Samtanu just before they part. Version A (1.91-92) opens with an assembly in Brahma's heaven and tells how Bh?sma's parents come to earth, meet, and reproduce. Version B (1.93) omits the prelude in heaven. The following outline applies to both. Dyaus belongs to an eight-member group of gods called Vasus. One day the Vasus offend the sage Vasistha and are cursed to be born as mortals. By chance or design they meet Ganga Ithe divinized River Ganges], and an agreement is reached that she shall become their mother. The Vasus wish to leave earthly life as quickly as possible, and Ganga agrees to drown them at birth. However her last son survives and becomes Bh?sma. The differences between versions A and B include the offence committed by the Vasus and the nature of the last-born, together with the reasons for his special status. In A the Vasus pass by the sage while he is meditating at twilight and fail to notice him, but in B the offence is less trivial. Accompanied by their wives, the Vasus are wandering in the forest near the sage's hermitage when Dyaus's wife sees the holy man's milk cow. Drawing the animal to Dyaus's attention, she learns that its milk confers lasting youth. She persuades him to steal it for the sake of a certain princess, a friend of hers, and the other Vasus participate in the theft. As for the last-born, in A the goddess herself proposes to the Vasus that Sarritanu be allowed to keep one son from his union. The Vasus each undertake to leave behind one eighth of the sperm (that is, in the womb)5 to contribute to the birth of the survivor?a motif that is ignored in the rest of the birth story. When Samtanu first meets Ganga, she insists that she will leave him at once if he criticizes her. Having borne eight god-like sons, she drowns each of them at birth (92.43-44), but when the eighth is born (sic; 92.46), the king can restrain himself no longer. His reproach prevents the drowning, but Ganga now reveals her divine identity and departs, leaving the child. In B the Vasus try to pacify the sage, and it is he who then distinguishes two levels of the curse: the Vasus in general will only spend one year on earth, while Dyaus, more deeply implicated in the theft, will spend a long time. In this version Gang? takes the infant away with her, only to return him later (1.94.22-36), as a well-educated teenager. Ignoring the various discrepancies in the Sanskrit, let us turn to the Greek or,</page><page sequence="5">Bh?sma and Hesiod1 s Succession Myth I 61 more precisely, to our earliest source. After its proem, the Theogony can easily be dissected into genealogical matter and narrative proper, the latter consisting of myths and digressions (West 1966: 16-18). The genealogical matter is organized roughly by generation (Figure 2), and within each of the four main generations the narrative covers the deeds and offspring of the relevant gods. I summarize: Ouranos6 [Heaven] and Gaia or G? [Earth] have a series of children, of whom the youngest is Kronos. Ouranos hates his children and prevents them issuing from Earth. Gaia encourages them to rebel, and after castrating his father, Kronos becomes king of the gods, marrying his sister Rhea. Learning from his parents that he is fated to be defeated by his own child, he swallows his children one by one, immediately at birth. His children are the three goddesses Hestia, Demeter, and Hera, followed by three gods, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. But Zeus is not in fact swallowed. Appalled at the treatment of her children, when Rhea is about to give birth for the sixth time she complains to her parents. They advise her to go to Crete and hide the infant Meanwhile she tricks Kronos by wrapping up a stone and giving it to him in place of the infant. When Zeus is old enough, Kronos is induced to vomit up what he swallowed, starting with the stone, which becomes sacred. After a ten-year war, helped by some of his father's brothers, Zeus defeats Kronos and the Titans and relegates them to Tartaros. It only remains for him to defeat the monstrous Typhoeus, ensure that he himself is not displaced, and produce his own children. grandparental generation ( G+2 j Ouranos Gaia i-.-1 i-1 parental generation ( G+ i &gt; Kronos Rhea I-.-1 I I own generation (GO) Zeus Hera _J T" children* s generation ( G-1 j Athena etc. Figure 2.

Allen Birth stories Serial "infanticide" The "killer" is one or other parent?mother Ganga or father Kronos?and the act takes place virtually at birth. Ganga throws the children in the water as each is born (j?tam j?tam; 1.92.44),7 while Kronos swallows each child as it comes from the womb to the mother's knees (the parturient Rhea is envisaged in kneeling position). Victims In both cases the victims form an unbroken sequence of siblings, respectively eight males or three females plus two males.8 The numerical matching of the Greek gods and goddesses recalls the matching of Vasus with their wives, though the latter are mentioned only as indicated above. In both cases, although he almost becomes a victim, the youngest sibling survives. Mode of "killing" Both killers dispose of their victims into their own bodily substance. The anthropomorphic Ganga drowns the infants in the river Ganges?her own divine form (1.92.44,1.93.41). Kronos puts them in his own stomach. Reaction of nonkiller parent Saqatanu was not pleased at the drownings (1.92.45) but cannot object because of the promise imposed on him by his wife when they first met; however, on the eighth and last occasion his grief forces him to protest. Rhea suffers terrible grief at the swallowing (penthos alaston; Theogony 467) but takes no action until the sixth and last occasion. Confinement, then return to divine status The time spent by the Vasus in the womb and as infants can be seen as a disagreeable spell of imprisonment imposed by the sage as a punishment. Afterwards they resume normal celestial life, and even Bh?sma, the long-stay prisoner on earth, eventually rejoins the Vasus when his soul flies up to heaven (13.153.44, 13.154.5). The five Greek deities are not being punished, but after their confinement in Kronos' belly they regain the freedom that deities normally enjoy; even the stone (Zeus's substitute) becomes an object of worship. Moreover, like his siblings and substitute, Zeus too is in a sense confined: Rhea hides him in a remote cave, and Gaia, the Earth, nurtures him. Mother temporarily removes last-born When she leaves ?arptanu, Gang? removes Bh?sma to educate him (version B).</page><page sequence="7">Bh?sma and Hesiod*s Succession Myth I 63 Rhea removes Zeus to Crete to save him from being swallowed. Both the "survivors" renew contact with their father when they are mature. Raised above ground After his birth the career of the mortal bachelor Bh?sma has little in common with that of the uxorious king of the gods. However, both figures are involved in the major human war of their respective epic traditions, and (unexpectedly, perhaps) both, whether permanently or temporarily, support the losers. During his marshalship Bh?sma fights bravely for the Kauravas, but on the evening of day ten he is shot down by Arjuna and Sikhannin. He chooses not to die at once and instead lies on an uncomfortable bed formed by the arrows sticking into his body, like a fakir lying on a bed of nails. As we are told twice, he does not touch the earth?the arrows are holding him above it.9 For the Greek parallel we must divert to Homer. In Iliad Book 14, responding to the request from Thetis, Zeus is favoring the Trojans, while Hera, as always, favors the Greeks. After elaborate preparation she gets Zeus to make love with her and fall asleep, thereby winning a respite for her prot?g?s. When Zeus embraced his wife, "beneath them the divine earth made fresh-sprung grass to grow, and dewy lotus, and crocus, and hyacinth, thick and soft, that upbare them from the ground" (apo khthonos hupsos* eerge; Iliad 14.349).i0 Thus in both epics (a) at a certain point the losing side finds its most effective protagonist, human or divine, abruptly rendered ineffective, (b) This inactivation is due to the participation of a female or quasi-female, for &amp;ikhannin was a female called Amb? in his former life and was then reborn as a girl, only acquiring a male organ when he married; this is why Bh?sma does not resist him. Hera's femininity is unproblematic. (c) The inactivated male lies down, but his recumbent posture does not bring him into contact with earth; his body is raised up (d) by multiple elongated objects of vegetable origin (whether dead or alive). (e) These objects possess a natural direction of movement (point of an arrow, growing tip of plant), and here, in both cases, the implied direction is upwards, into the recumbent male.11 The avoidance of contact with earth must be significant since it is mentioned earlier in Bh??ma*s career. To provide wives for his younger brother Bh?sma kidnaps three princesses from Benares, but the eldest, Amb?, he releases when she claims already to be engaged. However, when she finds herself rejected both by fianc? and kidnapper, Amb? puts the blame on the latter and persuades Paraaur?ma to fight him. During this duel Bh??ma receives help from eight Br?hmans who</page><page sequence="8">64 / Nicholas J. Allen claim that he is "their own body" (svasariram; 5.184.9). The octet [surely the Vasus who each contributed one eighth of the semen towards Bh?sma's birth in variant A] hold him in their arms, so that he does not touch earth: as he reports it, n?ham bh?mim up?sprsam (5.183.13). The obvious differences between hero on bed of arrows and god on bed of flowers are, I think, outweighed by the combination of the etymological link of Bhisma/Dyaus with Zeus, and the conceptual link of Dyaus with Earth. A deeper analysis might even show that Bh?sma's separation from earth relates to the motif of Heaven collapsing onto Earth in Theogony 702-3. But let us move to a more obvious comparison. BH?SMA AND OURANOS Since both dyaus and ouranos mean "heaven," one wonders whether the hero incarnating Dyaus has anything in common with Ouranos. Since Bh?sma couples with no one, we can here ignore the cosmogonie questions raised by comparing the frequent Rg Vedic pairing of heaven and earth with the Hesiodic coupling of Ouranos and Gaia. Bh?sma's career has two dramatic turning points, two "falls." The first is nonviolent when, as heir apparent, he renounces throne and matrimony. The second is violent when he is shot down by Arjuna and Sikhannin. The career of Ouranos has only one such "fall," but it can be compared with both of Bh?sma's. Simultaneous loss of kingship and virility After returning to his father, Bh?sma becomes crown prince. His father Samtanu spends four years without a partner (1.94.40) but then falls in love with the beautiful Satyavati. Though biologically the daughter of Vasu [Figure 11, she has been adopted by a Fisher King. However, the latter resists the marriage proposal until Bh?sma, of his own volition, swears two oaths. First he renounces the throne, so that Satyavati's son will succeed; and second he renounces marriage, lest any resultant sons contest the succession. The Fisher King now gladly assents, and the heavens applaud, giving the matchmaker his new name Bh?sma, "the Awesome." Ouranos detests his children and gladly hides them away in the darkness</page><page sequence="9">Bh?sma and Hesiod*s Succession Myth I 65 of the Earth. The Earth groans, tightly pressed inside (steinomen?; Theogony 160) and decides to resist. She creates a legendary metal [adamant] and, from it, a reaping hook and urges the children to punish Ouranos. When Kronos volunteers, Gaia gives him the sickle and puts him in an ambush. Ouranos approaches his wife to embrace her and is castrated by Kronos. Although Hesiod does not state that Ouranos was a king, the god clearly has the power to confine his children, and we learn later that the successor Kronos wants to monopolize the royal office (basiliida timen; Theogony 462). Apollodoms, in his first sentence, simply presents Ouranos as the first ruler of the universe (pr?tos...edunasteuse). In effect then Ouranos, like Bh?sma, loses kingship and virility on the same occasion. Of course, the oath is a voluntary act of filial devotion, while the castration is an act of revenge inflicted on an unwilling victim. The oath is taken by one who has been and will be childless, while Ouranos already has many children and his severed member will produce more. On the other hand, in both stories the son takes an initiative relating to a parental couple. Bh?sma is enabling his father to marry his future stepmother; Kronos is eliminating a cause of marital conflict?for henceforth Ouranos and Gaia cooperate, jointly issuing prophecies in the interests of Zeus (Theogony 470,891).12 Female assists in violent event If Bh??ma's first and nonviolent "fall" is ultimately caused by his future stepmother, his second and violent one is directly caused by the quasi-female Sikhannin, for he has taken an oath not to resist a female or ex-female. In the violent fall of Ouranos the role of the female is even more prominent. Gaia, his mother and wife, both creates the sickle and urges her children to use it. However, Gaia can be compared not only with Sikhannin in Bh?sma's second fall (as noted in passing by Briquel 1980: 260n65), but also with Amb? in Bh?sma's own generation. Amb? transmits her hatred for Bh?sma to her reincarnation and is thus the remoter cause of Bh?sma's second fall. From this point of view, Amb? ("incarnation mother") plus Sikhannin (male) parallels Gaia (mother) plus Kronos; both males take revenge on an older male who has offended their (quasi-)mother by denying her her normal female rights (to marry, to bring forth children).13 Looked at in this light, it is as if the Greek has conflated the two falls in Bh?sma's career, taking from the first the loss of kingship and virility and from the second the involvement of angry mother and violent son.</page><page sequence="10">66 / Nicholas J. Allen Paternal grandfathers of climactic protagonists From the point of view of the main warriors in the Great War, Bh?sma is the grandfather par excellence: the kinship term "pit?mahcT is regularly applied to him; for instance, some twenty times in the last five chapters of Book Six. Of course, since he has no children, the term "grandfather" is being used not biologically but in what anthropologists call a classificatory sense. He counts as or is regarded as grandfather to the biological descendants of his half-brothers' half-brother Vy?sa.14 The climactic figure in the Succession Myth is Zeus, and from his point of view Ouranos is paternal grandfather. But since Kronos and Rhea are siblings, Ouranos is also Zeus's maternal grandfather, which leads to our third comparison. VASU UPARICARA AND OURANOS If Zeus's maternal grandfather is Ouranos and Zeus sometimes corresponds to Bhisma, then we need to ask about Bh?sma's maternal grandfather. Bh?sma's biological mother is of course Ganga, but his birth story makes no reference to Gang?'s father, and we must look rather to his stepmother. When Bh?sma arranges his father's second marriage, in his first words to Satyavat? he calls her "mother" (m?tar; 1.94.91); and her biological father is the interesting figure of King Vasu Uparicara (Dum?zil 1971: 301-15). Since we are comparing Bh?sma's classificatory mother's father with Zeus's mother's father, this section supplements the Bh?sma-Zeus comparisons of section one. The two sections could indeed be run together. Name expresses altitude While Ouranos simply means "Heaven," Uparicara means "moving or walking above or in the air"; upari is cognate with English over, and car means "go." The name alludes to an airborne chariot in which Vasu can ride aloft like a god?one of several gifts he received from Indra. Position within the tradition Although the account of Vasu's career does not come until quarter way through Book 1, the start of the epic relates less to the main story than to its frame</page><page sequence="11">Bh?sma and Hesiod's Succession Myth I 67 stories, which tell how the main story came to be told, and it is stated (1.1.50) that some who learn the epic only start from the story of Uparicara (chapter 57). This is in fact the start of the causal chain that leads to the Great War. Thus, Madeleine Biardeau (2002: 189) calls this section of her summary Entr?e dans la mati?re, Entry into the substance of the story, and John Brockington (1998: 135-36) gives reasons for supposing that at least some versions of the epic started at this point15 It is worth summarizing by chapters the contents of this part of Book One: [53-56] Preliminary.

Hesiod does not come to the birth of Ouranos till line 127, but this too is misleading, for the first 115 lines of the Theogony consist of a hymn and invocation to the muses, the source of the poet's inspiration. Moreover, one should not think of the poem in isolation. Apollodorus' compendium opens abruptly with the Succession Myth, and according to the summary of the lost Cyclic epics, their first book, the Titanomachy, opened with the fabled union of Ouranos and G? (fragment 1; Evelyn-White 1982). Thus Hesiod*s poem seems to be just one version of the cosmogonie and th?ogonie material that opened the mass of more or less coherent oral tradition that lies behind both Homer and the Cycle (cf. Burgess 2001). Thus even if their stories were totally discrepant, from a formal point of view Vasu and Ouranos would share a primal position within their respective traditions. Both are male figures heading a line of succession after which there follows a vast body of narrative. Furthermore, in both cases, their story is located close to passages consisting wholly of genealogical information about supernaturals; and such passages intervene before we reach the birth of Bh?sma and Zeus two generations later. Lack of father Despite the copious genealogies in this part of the epic, nothing is said of Vasu's parents. Apart from his name, nothing explicitly connects him with the eight Vasus, who are the sons of Praj?pati, himself son of Brahma (1.60.16).</page><page sequence="12">68 / Nicholas J. Allen In Hesiod (Theogony 116-22) the first generation (G+3) simply comes into being (verb gignomai) and consists of Chasm, Gaia, Tartarus (in the plural), and Eros (Love). Earth then produces Ouranos, followed by mountains, nymphs, and sea, all without a partner. Only then, with Ouranos as partner, does she give birth to Ocean and eleven other children, the Titans, of whom Kronos is the youngest; and finally (at this point in the story) to the triads of Cyclops and Hundred-Handers. The lack of father for Vasu/Ouranos is further evidence of their primordiality. Wife goes back further Nothing is said of the mother or mothers of Vasu's five sons, but we learn a little about Girik?, the mother of his daughter. The river Suktimat? is raped, impregnated, and imprisoned by the [personified] Mount Kol?hala. Vasu kicks a passage through the mountain, and the river, grateful to her liberator, gives him the twins she bears. The male twin becomes Vasu's general, while the female, Girik?, becomes his wife. So while Vasu lacks parents, his wife's parents are a mountain and a river. Since Ouranos' wife is also his mother, she goes back to the generation before her husband. The name Girik? is from giri "mountain," the noun applied to her father. I would not put much weight on the earthiness shared by Girik? and Gaia, but one notes the naturalism (sky, water, mountain) of most characters in this part of the narrative. Unusual birth of daughter One day, when about to make love with Girik?, Vasu is obliged to break off and go hunting. In the forest, still feeling amorous, he ejaculates and, catching the semen in a leaf, gives it to a kite to convey to his wife. Attacked by another kite, the bird drops the semen into the Yamun?, where a fish swallows it. The fish is in reality an apsaras called Adrik?, who is under a curse. She is impregnated, and when she is later caught and cut open by a fisherman she is found to contain twins. Vasu takes the boy, who becomes King Matsya ["Fish"], and gives the girl twin, the virtuous Satyavati, to the fisherman. When Kronos cuts off his father's genitals he throws them behind him. The blood that drips from them is received by the Earth, who eventually gives birth to Erinyes [goddesses of retribution], armed giants, and a category of</page><page sequence="13">Bh?sma and Hesiod's Succession Myth I 69 nymphs. The genitals fall in the sea and, after floating for a while, give rise to white foam, in which there forms a maiden called [among other names] Aphrodite [aphros means "foam"]. Her business, both among gods and men, is seduction and erotic activity. Thus on land the severed genitals emit blood, whence come two sorts of aggressive being, and in the sea they give rise to foam, whence the nonviolent Aphrodite. The contrast is clear enough to suggest an expansion. If the red blood comes from the cut end of the genitals, the white foam could well come from the other end, in which case it represents semen?indeed the link between foam and semen was made by a number of ancient authors or commentators (West 1966: 212-13). Anyway, whether via semen or via generative matter in some vaguer sense, Ouranos is here presented as fathering Aphrodite in an unusual manner. But Vasu's fathering of Satyavati is also unusual. We must look more closely. Amorous father The emotional relation between the Sanskrit couple is quite different from the Greek: Vasu and Girik? are explicitly in love, while Gaia angrily plots against her husband. Nevertheless, in both stories the male makes amorous advances that are interrupted; and both are now producing their last offspring. Transmission of "semen" Again there are many differences. Vasu survives entire, while Ouranos is castrated. While Vasu ejaculates, it is only said of Ouranos that the foam "began to grow from the immortal flesh." Vasu dispatches his semen to his wife via a bird, while Ouranos' semen, contained in the genitals, is thrown away by the castrator, who does not even look where he is throwing them. Nevertheless, in both cases, generative matter traveling through the air replaces normal love making. Passing at first over land, it then falls into water?whether river or sea. Paired partners In some respects Girik? and Adrik? are doublets. The names are of similar form; if giri means "mountain," adri means "stone"; and both are in a sense partners to Vasu. On the other hand, the well-loved Girik?, daughter of the raped river, is Vasu's wife in an ordinary sense and provides the erotic stimulus for the birth of SatyavatL Adrik? never even meets Vasu. She is a celestial nymph who, for reasons not stated, has been cursed by Brahma to live as a fish until she gives birth to human twins, and on being cut open she rejoins the nymphs, among whom she dances and sings at the birth of Arjuna (1.114.50). In contemporary parlance she is the surrogate mother of Satyavat?, her ovum- and womb-provider</page><page sequence="14">70 / Nicholas J. Allen ?as distinct from her biological father's wife and partner (Girik?) and her nurturing mother (the unnamed wife of the Fisher King). The blood and semen of Ouranos are both generative, but each has a different matrix. The blood is received (dexato; Theogony 184) by Gaia, Ouranos' normal partner, while the genitals and semen are carried (phereto; 190) by the sea, which Ouranos himself never meets. Although the sea is not here personified, as is Adrik?, the period of "gestation" is comparable. The fisherman catches Adrik? in the tenth month of her pregnancy, and the genitals float for a long time (poulun khronon; Theogony 190). In short, Girik?, as terrestrial and normal wife at home, parallels Gaia [= Earth], while Adrik?, as aqueous and one-off partner at a distance, parallels the sea. Paired offspring The Sanskrit has male-female twins in two successive generations?the marshal and Girik?, then Matsya and Satyavat?. A comparable "twinning" can perhaps be recognized in the land and sea offspring of Ouranos' genitals. Admittedly, the triad of offspring from the blood blurs the pairing in Hesiod, and the picture is different in Apoilodorus (Bibliotheke 1.1.4, 1.3.1) who, like Homer (Iliad 5.370-71), makes Aphrodite a daughter not of Ouranos but of Zeus, by Dione. Shellfish The name ?uktimat? is from sukti "pearl oyster, oyster shell." Depictions of Aphrodite's birth from the fourth century onwards show her rising from or riding in an opening scallop shell (Carpenter 1991: 69; illustrations can be found in LIMC 1981-99). Of course this is to connect Aphrodite not with Satyavat? but with her grandmother, but shellfish are sufficiently rare in both bodies of mythology for the connection to be suggestive.17 ARJUNA AND ZEUS Having looked upwards two generations from Bh?sma/Zeus, we now symmetri cally look downwards two generations from Bh?sma/Ouranos. Comparison 4 (Arjuna/Zeus) reinforces comparison 2 (Bh?sma/Ouranos), as comparison 3 (Vasu Uparicara/Ouranos) reinforced comparison l (Bh?sma/ Zeus). Most salient grandson of parallel figures One hardly needs to argue that Arjuna, companion of Krsna, is the most salient</page><page sequence="15">Bh?sma and Hesiod's Succession Myth I 71 of Bh?sma's classificatory grandchildren or that Zeus is the most salient grandson of Ouranos, but we do need to face a paradox. It is often suggested that Zeus corresponds more to Indra than to his etymological cognate Dyaus (for example, O'Flaherty 1987), but although Zeus is king of the gods and Arjuna is the son of Indra, king of the gods (or incarnates him; 1.189.25), Arjuna is not a king (any more than is the epic Krsna). Both before the dicing and after the Great Battle, the throne belongs to Yudhisthira, the eldest son of P?nnu. Nevertheless, in spite of his position in the birth order, Arjuna is often the P?n?ava par excellence, the one who represents the brothers as a set; for instance, it is he who wins their shared wife Draupad?, who brings the war to a successful conclusion, and who accompanies the sacrificial horse in Book Fourteen. It is easy to feel that he "ought" to be king, and Biardeau even refers to him as the "virtual king." I have discussed this point in terms of four-function theory elsewhere (Allen 1999b), and I here simply note that if Arjuna is the P?Qnava par excellence, Zeus is the god par excellence. Two sorts of conflict Despite Arjuna's central role in the eighteen days of the Great War (Books 6-9), it is Bh?ma, the second P???ava brother, who kills Duryodhana, the Kaurava supremo, and thereby brings the ordinary fighting to an end. However, this is not the end of the whole conflict. In the night attack (Book 10), Asvatth?man massacres most of the remaining P?nnava allies while they are asleep, and the following morning his magical weapon almost causes the destruction of the cosmos and the definitive interruption of the P?nnava line of succession. It is Arjuna and Krsna, acting together, who counter this ultimate threat and ensure that Bh?ma's victory is not hollow.18 Within the Theogony one finds two battles fought by Zeus, the first against the Titans, the second against Typhoeus (it is only later sources such as Apollodorus 1.6 who mention the Giants as a third supernatural enemy of Zeus). The long drawn-out Titanomachy lasts ten years and is won when, on the advice of Gaia, Zeus and his siblings call up the Hundred-Handers from the depths of the earth. Zeus leads these allies as well as the Olympians, and the Titans are imprisoned in Tartarus. Uniting with Tartarus, Gaia then bears the monstrous Typhoeus, whom Zeus, acting by himself, flings into Tartarus. Now that these enemies have been vanquished, divine society is established and the text passes to Zeus's marriages. Thus Arjuna, like Zeus, is initially the leading figure in a successful collective battle that lasts for a good while, then as an individual, with or without a single helper, he defeats one final antagonist relatively quickly. In other words, the</page><page sequence="16">72 / Nicholas J. Allen Kauravas, children of the elder brother Dhrtar?stra, correspond to the Titans, the older generation of gods (G+l), while the P?nnavas, the junior branch, correspond to the Olympians (GO); and Asvatth?man corresponds to Typhoeus. Multiple wives Apart from the shared Draupad?, each P?n?ava brother has a further wife who bears him one son, but among them Arjuna's wife Subhadr? and her son Abhimanyu are far the most salient. The list of eleven sons of the P?nnavas (1.90.82-89) includes one further entry?Ghatotkaca, born to Bhima from his brief liaison with the demonic Hi?imba, but it fails to include two other wives and sons belonging to Arjuna: during the journey on which he acquires Subhadr? he also marries Ul?p? and Citr?ngad?, who bear him respectively Ir?vat and Babhruv?hana (Allen 2000). Although omitted from the Book 1 list, these additional wives are present at the Horse Sacrifice. The Theogony (886-923) lists no less than seven wives of Zeus, ranging from Metis to Hera, though the six later ones may not be part of Hesiod's own poem. No other deity is so well supplied with wives. Sad loss of son Arjuna loses Ir?vat on day eight and Bhima loses Ghatotkaca on night fourteen; but the most important casualty is Abhimanyu on day thirteen. Both the death itself and the reactions it arouses are treated at length. Arjuna is desolated. He swears prompt revenge and accomplishes it, though not without difficulty. Naturally, since gods are immortal, Zeus suffers no losses while fighting the Titans. However, the other Great War dominating early Greek epic is of course the ten-year siege of Troy, and here Zeus loses his beloved son Sarpedon. Admittedly, Abhimanyu fights on the side of the ultimately victorious represen tatives of dharma, while Sarpedon leads the allies of the Trojans, the Losers, and other bereavements can be brought into the picture. Nevertheless, both Arjuna and Zeus are deeply affected by the death in battle of a much-loved son. CONCLUSION The comparisons made above have focused on the texts mentioned at the start, and while numerous questions have been consciously skirted, others may well have been missed inadvertently. A full comparison would certainly be far longer</page><page sequence="17">Bh?sma and Hesiod's Succession Myth I 73 and more complicated. Thus, we have mentioned only fleetingly a Sikhan?in Kronos rapprochement, without looking further afield for parallels to Kronos such as Azhdah?k (Wikander 1952); and we have ignored the long-noted and important comparison between Earth complaining to Brahma about over population (1.58) and Earth making the same complaint to Zeus (scholion to Iliad 1.5); see, for example, J. W. de Jong (1985) and Christophe Vielle (1996: 40-46, 115-23). The aim has not been to exhaust the comparison but to argue that the start of the Mah?bh?rata main story and the Hesiodic Succession Myth are sufficiently similar to imply a protonarrative. Although a definitive model of the protonarrative will need much more work, I offer some preliminary reflections. A regular problem in comparativism is to decide which of two cognate narratives to treat as synchronically basic and/or diachronicaily closer to the protonarrative. As Figure 3 suggests, there are perhaps two key issues. Were the protonarrative agents primarily humans (whether or not associated with gods), as in the Sanskrit, or were they gods, as in the Greek? This question I do not attempt to answer.19 But one also wonders whether the narrative matter was originally spread over five generations, like the Sanskrit, or over three, like the Greek; and here I prefer the hypothesis of Sanskrit conservatism. Mah?bh?rata Hero Linked Deity Greek God Vasu(G+4) (?Vasusi ?**^^ ^&gt; Ouranos (G+2) Bh?sma (G+2) Dyaus &lt;^^ J^&gt; Zeus (GO) Arjuna (GO) Indra -^^^^ Figure 3. Overview of the four main comparisons presented here. If the proto-narrative resembled the Sanskrit, its five-generation pattern was compressed to give the three generations of the Greek; one reads the diagram from left to right. For the alternative hypothesis one can either reverse the figure or read the present one from right to left. This preference is based partly on previous experience and partly on the Heimdall comparison or, more precisely, on the sociogony narrated in the Rigsthula (Dum?zil 1973: 118-25, Larrington 1996: 246-52). Here the god is involved successively in the marriages of "great-grandfather," "grandfather" and "father," and he is then involved in a different way with Konr ungr in the next</page><page sequence="18">74 / Nicholas J. Allen generation. Similarly, Bh?sma arranges the marriages of his father (G+3), his half-brother (G+2), and his nephews or classificatory sons (G+l), but not those of Arjuna's generation.20 This comparison, which I hope to elaborate elsewhere, suggests that the protonarrative involved more than three generations. If the five-generation Sanskrit schema is provisionally taken as the older, it makes sense to identify the protonarrative figures by prefixing the Sanskrit names. The main conceptual problem seems to concern proto-Bh?sma, who was presumably already linked (if not identified) with *Dyeus. As Figure 3 suggests, this proto-figure must have had a grandson, the proto-figure behind Indra (or his incarnation) and Zeus; moreover, in the Greek branch of the tradition he must in some sense have split, since he contributes to both Ouranos and Zeus. The point is expressed in another format in Table 1. Sanskrit Greek Protonarrative G+4 Vasu Ouranos * heavenly founder G+3 Satyavat? Aphrodite *founder's water-born daughter G+2 Bh?sma Zeus + Ouranos *infanticide birth story + adult fall G+l ? ? ? GO Arjuna Zeus * king with two styles of combat Table 1. Preliminary attempt to model the protonarrative, based on assumption that it had five generations. The first ascending generation has been left blank since it has barely been studied here. This paper offers an approach and results that differ from those of philologists. For instance, Wolfram Euler (1987: 51-52) concludes that the original Indo Europeans lacked a pantheon with a clear genealogical structure and that their deities, associated with features of the natural environment, possessed only the germs of kinship relationships. While recognizing a nuclear family within the proto-pantheon, George Dunkel (1988-90) sees Indra as deriving much of his content from Parjanya, a thunder god, who himself derives from one of the epithets applied to *Dyeus. This paper suggests rather that the proto-Indo European family of gods included two important males who were two generations apart. The grandfather, called *Dyeus, personified heaven or sky, while the grandson was presumably linked with a part of the cosmos that was less remote (Indra is regularly associated with the atmosphere, understood as situated between heaven and earth). Within the myth (so this is not a matter of historical change), the grandfather was in some sense replaced by the grandson,</page><page sequence="19">Bh?sma and Hesiod's Succession Myth I 75 who became king of the gods.21 However, during the history of the Greek tradition the grandson took over the grandfather's name. In Dunkel's notation: G+2 *Dyeus GO ^Thunder God? (semantic and narrative content) G+2 Ouranos GO Zeus Whatever the final conclusions on these matters, and whatever we make of the West Asian rapprochement (which is undeniable), it becomes ever clearer that we shall never properly understand the roots of European culture without taking account of India's great epic and that we shall never understand the roots of Hinduism without tackling Indo-European cultural comparativism. (power) Notes 1. For translations see respectively van Buitenen 1973; West 1988; and Hard 1997. 2. Sergent refers to his later book (1998: 193-235), which explores trifunc tional interpretations of the Theogony; but, though it draws on the Satapatha Br?hmana, that chapter makes no reference to Bh??ma or the epic. 3. Strictly speaking these are distinct ways of linking gods and men, but the text sometimes blurs the distinction. 4. The comparison proposed by Skjaervo (1998) between Bh?sma and Rostam in the Iranian epic leaves me unconvinced. 5. The gloss comes from van Buitenen (1973: 455) and is confirmed by 1.2.78-79 and 1.57.77. The eight-plus-one pattern is important in the Heimdall comparison but also occurs elsewhere in India: a king's body is made from particles of the eight Lokap?las (Manusmrti 5.96,7.5). 6. Or Uranus, the Latinized form. 7. On the other hand Vasistha (1.93.36) mentions each Vasu spending a year on earth (no doubt including the period in the womb).</page><page sequence="20">76 / Nicholas J. Allen 8. Perhaps the females come first because the vomiting, which amounts to a rebirth, reverses the order of the swallowing (cf. West 1966 at Theogony 454, 497). 9. At 6.114.84: dharan?m n?sprsat; and at 6.115.8: sa sete saratalpastho medin?m asprsams tad?. 10. Translation by A. T. Murray (Loeb edition). The "lotus" actually refers to plants that were wild fodder for horses and cows (Janko 1992: 206). 11. Moreover, just before the coupling, a passage occurs that is paralleled in the story of Satyavat?. A male (Parasara/Zeus) proposes sex; the female (Satyavat?/Hera) objects that they are in the open and may be seen; the male creates privacy by means of a mist (n?hara; 1.57.59), darkness (tamas; 1.99.10), or golden cloud (nephos; Iliad 14.343). This rapprochement, which aligns Zeus with Parasara not Bh?sma, supports the wider argument that the Zeus-Hera story in Book 14 is cognate with stories attached to senior figures in the plot of the Mah?bh?rata. 12. Rather surprisingly, dyaus in the Vedas is often of feminine gender. Linguists have explained this by its pairing with prthivi in the dvandva compound and/or by analogy with the rhyming word gaus "cow" (Wackemagel 1925: 68), but might not Bhisma's loss of virility also be relevant? 13. If Sikhannin (female) in part repeats or echoes Amb?, then the kindly Yaksa who enables her to marry by loaning her his male organ (5.192.17-193.9) in part echoes Bh?sma helping his father to marry. Such intergenerational echoes can be found in both traditions. For instance, it is not only Bh?sma and Ouranos who experience a "fall"; so do Vasu Uparicara (Dum?zil 1971: 308), Indra (when temporarily displaced by Nahusa; see Allen 2003), and Kronos. 14. Vy?sa, the physical grandfather, born on the Yamun?, needs to be seen in relation to Bh?sma, the honorary (spiritual?) grandfather, born of the Ganga. Among gods the grandfather par excellence is Brahma, but to explore a Brahma Bh?sma link would take us too far afield. 15. Contra the editorial note (CE 1.91) claiming that "the story proper" begins at chapter 91, a view apparently followed by van Buitenen (1973: xvi). 16. In referring to chapters 59-61, West (1966: 4-5) uses the vulgate numbers, 65-67, rather than CE, and classes together genealogies and lists of incarnations. The latter are "partial" so that gods, even while incarnated, can continue to live and operate in the divine realm. 17. Good reasons exist for seeing Aphrodite as cognate with the Vedic dawn goddess Usas (Boedeker 1974; Dunkel 1988-90: 8-11; Friedrich 1978), and the argument for an additional Aphrodite-Satyavat? rapprochement does not controvert them. 18. It is arguable too that, as a warrior, Duryodhana represented a lesser</page><page sequence="21">Bh?sma and Hesiod's Succession Myth I 11 military threat to the P?nnavas than Kama, defeated by Arjuna in Book Eight. 19. It may even be wrongly posed. For instance, what if a god-focused pre protonarrative pre-existed a hero-focused protonarrative? 20. It is not clear in what sense Duryodhana, in abducting his bride, is "reliant upon" his seniors (bhtsma-dron?vup?sritah; 12.4.13), but nothing suggests that Bh?sma arranges the match. 21. Contrary to what one might expect, succession to a grandfather's position is probably more archaic than succession to the father's (Allen 2004). References Cited Allen, Nicholas J. 1998.
