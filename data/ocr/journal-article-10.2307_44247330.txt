<plain_text><page sequence="1">Workshop in Nutritional Assessment for Hospital Personnel Robert A. Halberstein Nutritional assessment has been increasingly recognized as an important component of medical care, especially the treatment of hospital patients, for two basic reasons: (1) nutritionąl status appears to be closely correlated with health maintenance and restoration, and (2) severely ill people are commonly diagnosed as also being nutritionally stressed. It has thus become appar- ent that proper nutritional evaluation procedures are essential skills for modern health care professionals. « . . workshops such as this might pave the way for further investigations into the association between nutritional status and patient health . . . A workshop in nutritional assessment was recently conducted at Baptist Hospital in Miami, Florida (Halberstein, Current Anthropology 20:240). The five-week instructional program represented one segment of a series of biomedical training seminars for nurses supported by the hospital's In-Service Education and Skill Enhance- ment Program. The overall purpose of the project was to demonstrate techniques for the accurate and comprehensive assessment of the nutritional status of hospital patients. Thirty-five nurses and hospital nutritionists experienced lectures, labor- atory demonstrations, and finally their own involvement and participation in nutritional evalu- ation procedures. • The workshop opened with introductory back- ground material on the overlap and collaboration of scientific research in medicine, nutrition and anthropology. Anthropological literature was provided on world-wide comparisons of human body composition, physical dimensions, and biochemical characteristics. The results of cross- cultural research on factors influencing human morphology and nutritional status were illustrated with slides showing variations in the body form of people living in diverse environments and condi- tions. Genetic, climatic, cultural, and nutritional aspects of human physical and biochemical variation were explored. Published studies were reviewed on the constitutional effects of the following: "race" and ethnic background, sexual dimorphism, aging, geography and altitude, weather and climate, dietary habits, exercise and activity patterns, disease and nutritional stress, and the inheritance of certain well-defined genetic conditions (e.g., achondroplasia, Duchenne mus- cular dystrophy, dystonia musculorum de- formans, etc.). An extensive bibliography on nutritional assessment was prepared and distributed. Anthropometric methods, techniques and in- struments were introduced with an historical discussion of their practical uses and limitations. In two subsequent workshop sessions, 53 separate anthropometric dimensions were demonstrated in a step-by-step format, and these are listed in Table 1. The measurements were selected on the basis of their relevance to nutritional assessment, according to standard references on the subject. All areas of the body were included-head, face, neck, trunk, arms, legs, hands, feet, etc. Detailed diagrams of body parts depicting the location of measurement points and landmarks were dis- tributed. Several alternative procedures were presented for the accurate recording of stature and weight. Skinfold readings obtained from ten different sites were compared with Lange, Harpenden and Ross calipers. A number of important anthropometric indices were also calculated (e.g., cephalic, nasal, ponderal, body density, etc.). Protocols for problem cases, such as bedridden or physically deformed patients, were described: ####################»»»»#&gt;#####################»»»»»» Robert A.

Upper arm muscle diameter (tricep) , a widely used index of muscularity, was derived with the formula: upper arm = Circumference - skinfold muscle diameter é00fr0 The same formula is also appropriate for the assessment of thigh muscularity and adiposity. The resulting calibrations (three trials for each separate measurement) were pooled and com- pared in order to illustrate investigator and examinee variability. Published "forms" for each of the anthropometric characteristics were made available to aid in nutritional evaluation. The ten selected anthropometric measurements were combined with standard biochemical indica- tors of nutritional status, demographic informa- tion, and dietary history data in the construction of a computerized patient "nutritiongram." The 26 basic laboratory criteria listed in Table 2 may be used according to availability and feasibility. The biochemical variables and methods for testing are described by Blackburn and Thornton (1979), Pearson (1962, 1966), and Sauberlich, et al. (1974). The "nutritiongram" data sheet was designed for the streamlined collection and rapid computer coding of information on individual patients. A large number of anthropometric, laboratory, demographic, and dietary variables could be easily coded and compiled by computer programs such as "SPSS" (Nie, et al., 1975) or "BMDP" (Dixon, 1975).

This work might ultimately lead to recommendations regarding possible nutritional support actions for specific casés. During the four-month period following the nutritional workshop the participating nurses collected data and composed trial "nutrition- grams" for all adult patients (except obstetric) at Baptist Hospital in Miami. This preliminary screening involved a total sample of 773 patients, including 655 from the Medical-Surgical division, 82 from Critical Care, and 36 from Oncology. Average age was 52.7 years (Baptist Hospital), 1979). Individuals manifesting signs of nutritional stress or deficiencies are currently being re- studied more intensively.

The possible relationship between nutri- tional status and success of patient treatment is now being closely monitored (Baptist Hospital, 1979). It is hoped that workshops such as this might pave the way for further investigations into the association between nutritional status and patient health as well as the relationship between nutritional assessment and patient health care. Perhaps eventually more complete nutritional evaluations, aided by anthropological techniques, will routinely assist in the successful diagnosis and treatment of hospital patients in the future.</page></plain_text>
