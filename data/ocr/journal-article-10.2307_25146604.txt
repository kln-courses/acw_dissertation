During that time many persons have con tributed toward my growing knowledge of the Pacific Northwest and each of them should be partially credited here. Although they are too numerous to name, my gratitude goes to them all. Other persons have contributed directly to the work and I acknowledge my debt to them with real pleasure. The opportunity to meet Ernest Bertelson and to see his Suquamish Collection was afforded by an ethnological field trip in the last months of 1938 under the auspices of the Columbia Uni versity Council for Research in the Social Sci ences. I wish to express my appreciation to the Council for this initial contact with the archae ology of Puget Sound. In 1938, Mr. Bertelson allowed me to bring the major part of his collec tion to New York to study at my leisure. Two years later he shipped east the items he had since gathered. He has answered innumerable questions and he drew the artifacts for illustra tion. Museum collections of archaeological ma terials will yield valuable information on this area once they are studied but they cannot, of course, be loaned for long periods and shipped around the country at the anthropologist's con venience. I am particularly grateful, therefore, to Mr. Bertelson?for without his generosity I might never have known the irritations and satis factions that come from a study of archaeological specimens. When he was in New York in 1939, Philip Drucker made the original classification of over two-thirds of the artifacts of Bertelson's Su quamish Collection, thus setting the stage for V further work. I also benefited at that time by the observations of William Duncan Strong, and of Gordon Willey and Albert C. Spaulding, both of whom were then students of archaeology in Co lumbia University. None of these men was able actually to work on the artifacts but they handled them and passed comments which were of immeasurable value. In 1945, when I was director of the Columbia University Summer Field Trip in British Co lumbia, Robert N. Hill, one of the members of the party, heard of McClallum's Middle Fraser Collection. The collection was started by the late Malcolm McClallum and continued by James McClallum. Brief excavations made by the field party at the McClallum site have been reported upon elsewhere. But the artifacts collected by the McClallums within the relatively narrow con fines of their farm started me off on a number of new lines of investigation and I wish to thank the members of the party most sincerely for their patience in bearing with me while I explored these and struggled with the entanglements of classification. Especially, I wish to thank Eleanor Leacock for her constant interest, and both Mr. McClallum and Miss Jane McClallum for their warm friendliness. While the manuscript was being completed dur ing the summer of 1948, Frederica de Laguna was both a real help and a solace. A last note of gratitude also goes to Mrs. Helen Service for typing the manuscript and to Dr. Irving Rouse for seeing it through press. Marian W.

Certainly in any attempt at his torical reconstruction, or even when an ethnolo gist traces out movements and contacts of people, the two fields almost completely merge. Yet at such times, the reliance of the ethnologist upon the archaeologist is often very great indeed. Seldom does he himself review the evidence for any but the most revolutionary conclusions, and he generally leans heavily upon the archaeolo gist's summaries of primary data. Unless there is some special reason for doing otherwise, he tends to accept the archaeologist's general statements and to make further use of them in his own work. This being the case, I naturally turned to the archaeologist when I first started working with the Northwest Coast people of southern Puget Sound in 1935. Unfortunately, I was, in this case, doomed to disappointment. In the first place, no excavations had been carried on in that part of the Sound; and, in the second place, reconnaissance work there had yielded impover ished shell heaps suggesting only that the his toric people, with their cultural emphasis upon wood and basketry products, had had earlier precursors who had been no more richly en dowed archaeologically than they were them selves. The deeper I went into the ethnographic material the less satisfying this latter conclusion became. Ethnological currents could be traced to the east, to the south, and to the north, and strange local complexities arose. The only thing which supported the archaeological picture of a simple fishing economy slowly developing in situ was the people's fine technical adaptation to their environment, and even this needed further illumi nation when one glanced to the far north and saw similar devices adapted to economic pur suits under rather different environmental con ditions. It was hard to believe that none of these factors could be clarified by archaeology. In 1938, when Ernest Bertelson showed me his collection of artifacts and described the con ditions under which they had been obtained at Suquamish on Puget Sound, the archaeological horizon seemed to brighten. Certainly the large number of artifacts collected on one site by Bert elson showed it to have been anything but impoverished. Here was abundant archaeological evidence and the present study began with an attempt to describe it. As so often happens, when the literature was carefully combed and all the available data, inadequate as they were, were brought together, it was found that several con structive formulations or conclusions could be arrived at. In 1945, acquaintance with the Mc Clallum artifacts, collected on a restricted area near Agassiz on the middle Fraser River, led to further consideration of the materials of the general area. This review of the archaeology served to elaborate greatly the original, over simplified picture drawn by the most widely ac cepted of the early workers and, in so far as this was true, the results of archaeological and ethnological work tended to approach each other. If the total picture of culture development in the southern Northwest Coast has become immeas urably more complicated than formerly, it is, one supposes, nothing more than anthropologists might have expected. The area under discussion here may be con veniently labeled the Columbia-Fraser region. It is a coastal and river region lying between, and in the general neighborhood of, the Colum bia and Fraser rivers in the western portions of southern British Columbia, Washington, and northern Oregon. Part of the coast line faces the open Pacific, but the greater length of shore fol lows inland bodies of salt water such as Puget Sound and the Straits of Juan de Fuca (see Fig. 1). The climate is mild, with a heavy rain fall, and the area, although largely despoiled today, was rich in marine and land fauna and had a generous flora. Salmon were particularly abundant in the streams, and cedars grew to astonishing size.1 At the time of white contact, the region was dominated by peoples speaking Coast Salish languages. A few Sahaptins had filtered into the southern section from the east; small and isolated Athapascan groups may have occurred in the southwest; and the northwestern 'See also M. W.

These minorities were greatly outnumbered, however, by the Coast Salish, who also controlled the overwhelming proportion of the occupied territory. The villages of the Coast Salish were politically autonomous, and marked cultural differentiations appeared in local areas.2 Although the underlying cultural traits were similar, the region may be divided into several rather distinct ethnological sub-areas.3 Be yond the region to the north, lay the northern Coast Salish of the upper arms of the Straits of Georgia, the Kwakiutl and, farther west, the Nootka; to the south, the peoples known ethno logically as those of northern California; and, to the east, east of the Cascades and the Coast Range, lived the Sahaptins and the Interior Salish of the Rocky Mountain intermontane plateau. The archaeology of the Columbia-Fraser re gion remains sketchy. Practically nothing has been done in the central and southern Puget Sound country since the turn of the century. In 1886, Rev. Myron Eells published his impres sions of the stone work which he had seen during the years of his missionary activities. His mis sion was located among the Twana of Hoods Canal and his work also familiarized him to a somewhat less extent with the Olympic Peninsula, with both shores of the lower Columbia River, and with the extreme southern Sound. In 1900, Judge James Wickersham of Tacoma published data based on a long acquaintance with the area. He seems to have generalized his descriptions from a surprisingly thorough knowledge of the Nisqually and Puyallup Indians of Olympia and Tacoma. In 1904, Harlan I. Smith published the results of the reconnaissance trip he had made five years earlier. He obtained in all some 250 artifacts from the entire area of the Sound from the San Juan Islands to Olympia?well over half the entire length of our region. Smith noted house sites and graves in the northern Sound but both he and Wickersham were mainly impressed by the liberal sprinkling of large shell heaps, shell heaps which, however, they both found to be relatively poor in artifacts. In the second decade of the twentieth century, Albert Reagan of the United States Indian Office furnished our only sources of information for the Indian reservations of northern Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula. Harlan I. Smith had - After M. W. Smith, 1946, p. 306. 'See Barnett, 1938; M. W. Smith, 1941, 1949. done some work on the lower Fraser and had worked more intensively in the Plateau in the upper regions of the Fraser and Columbia rivers. Within the last few decades, a definitive study of the Dalles-Deschutes region of the Columbia has been published by William Duncan Strong, W. E. Schenck, and Julian H. Steward, and a number of less extensive explorations have been made in Oregon and British Columbia. During the last few years, the University of Washington at Seattle has started an active archaeological program, beginning its excavations in the San Juan Islands.4 Much is to be hoped for from this program in the future. But in our present state of knowledge, the Bertelson Collection which is described in the following pages assumes considerable importance. It contains almost 1,000 items, mostly of stone, from a single loca tion in the central Sound area. The McClallam Collection, only briefly noted here, is smaller but may eventually prove to be of equal importance. There must certainly be other collections which it would pay to investigate?the present study relies mainly on the Bertelson Collection and upon published accounts of archaeological work. Neither Harlan I. Smith nor Wickersham were sanguine of the results to be obtained from archaeological investigations around Puget Sound. Wickersham actually prefaced his ac count with this discouraging statement: ". . . the conditions which surrounded the Puget Sound tribes gave them the minimum supply of stone relics, and the conditions which yet confront the inquiring student afford him also the smallest return for a vast amount of hard labor in search ing for them." Reagan's work did much to brighten this out look and modern stratigraphic excavations at the Dalles-Deschutes and in the San Juans al most entirely disprove it. It is true that artifacts from most of our region are not spectacular but, when one considers sites near the lower Fraser and middle Columbia rivers, the finds become spectacular enough for any but the confirmed Middle Americanist. The wonder is that they have received so little attention. Both these gen eral areas yield monolithic stone sculptures, some of which are over three feet in height. Stone sculptures also occur at the lowest levels of sites on the lower Fraser, where they are associated with intricate bone carvings and with consider 4 See the second paper in this volume (King, 1950).

Indeed, there is every indication in our present insufficient docu mentation that the lower Fraser may well have been the seat of an ancient culture which flowered roughly 2,000 years ago and which was more elaborate than any other known culture of the Pacific Northwest. One must go to the far north of the Pacific to find anything comparable. Wher ever its equals or rivals may lie, this monograph offers an archaeological framework for the south ern Northwest Coast to be expanded or demol ished as future data may dictate.</page><page sequence="9">THE BERTELSON SUQUAMISH COLLECTION ERNEST Bertelson began his collecting twenty or twenty-one years ago on a sandy spit on the former Suquamish Indian Reserva tion at Suquamish, Washington. Suquamish is on the west shore of Puget Sound almost directly across from Seattle and the spit lies south of the present Seattle-Suquamish ferry landing. On this same point of land, once stood the renowned Old Man House, largest aboriginal structure of the American Northwest. The bulk of the collec tion consists of chipped stone artifacts, varying in workmanship from beautifully finished points to crudely worked flakes and pecked cores. Some polished stone, a few bone pieces, and one piece of copper are also included. Mr. Bertelson moved away from Suquamish in 1944 and the collec tion, which has been kept intact, is now housed with his brother in Minnesota. By the summer of 1945 the spit was surveyed and divided into small building lots for the erection of a summer colony so that the possibility of obtaining further information is slight indeed. All of the materials in the collection were picked up along the water line of the beach. They were washed up after storms or other dis turbances of the shore line, such as clamming. Since the spit was also being gradually undercut by tidal action, finds were made irregularly but rather frequently. Only a portion of the shore line yielded artifacts. The fertile beach was a stretch six or seven hundred feet long adjacent to the former floor of Old Man House and on the more sheltered side of the spit. There can be no doubt that the artifacts were washed out of ground near where they were found for the beach was completely sterile to either side of the fertile section. Only at a point about a quarter of a mile west were a few adz blades recovered. Much of the value of the collection lies in the fact that Mr. Bertelson used no false criteria or selectivity; every piece of material showing signs of human workmanship has been included. The pieces vary in weight from fractions of an ounce to several pounds so that, although wave action may have sorted out some objects by size, the sorting is not apparent within this range. In addition to the artifacts described below, Bertel son picked up almost a bushel of chips and worked fragments. The spit was not excavated but, from the evi dence of post holes and diggings for telephone poles, seems to have an upper stratum of sand beneath which is a "conglomeration of ash, clam shells, and bits of rock."1 Old Man House was probably built during the last quarter of the eighteenth century and was occupied until it was burned by order of Army authorities. A large village at the mouth of a creek about three miles to the west divided when Old Man House was constructed,2 and those people who moved to the new village site retained the same name but further identified themselves by the name of their leader, Kitsap.3 Old Man House was so called by early settlers in deference to its size. There had previous to its construction been no per manent village of plank houses upon the spit.4 It had, however, been known as a clamming ground?clams are still taken from the spit? and as such had undoubtedly served as a camp ing ground for the parent village and, probably, for other villages as well5 over a considerable period of time. The heavy ash and shell content of the soil affirms long occupation. Artifacts must have accumulated both during the Old Man House period and during the preceding habi tation period. The surface stratum of sterile sand 1 Bertelson, communication. 2 Both of these are included in the "Suquamish" vil lage; see M. W. Smith, 1941, p. 207. 3 Not to be confused with Kitsap, the Muckleshoot warrior (Curtis, 1913, p. 14), nor with Old Kitsap, the Puyallup warrior (M. W. Smith, 19406, p. 328). 4 Details concerning the construction of Old Man House and the men who built it were obtained during ethnological investigations from Sam Wilson, a Suquam ish. Statements such as this, therefore, are taken from personal field notes: many of them may also be found in the various published accounts of Old Man House. Sam Wilson's home, the former Indian Agent's house at Suquamish, was on high ground not far from the Old Man House spit and he belonged to the same village as the builders. I am sorry to have to add that Mr. Bertel son has written me of his death, which occurred in June, 1941. *M. W. Smith, 1940a, p. 11; 19406, pp. 26-7, 140, 243-5; 1941, p. 201. 5</page><page sequence="10">6 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 6 may indicate a lapse of time between the artifact bearing stratum and the historic camping period. It is impossible to tell this definitely from the artifacts as collected. The evidence of the materials themselves bring the artifacts to the period of white con tact, for one point is made of dark blue, almost purple, glass?presumably bottle glass. How far back in time the artifacts go is, of course, diffi cult to say. Some of the basalt pieces are pati nated (see below Chipped Stone, IV, IX, and XIII: NBaX, NBc) but the patination is not very extensive. One of the bone pieces may show considerable ageing and no well preserved bits of antler have been recovered, yet such evidence remains inconclusive. The most telling evidence for a long time span is the large quantity of artifacts. According to old inhabitants in 1938, the beach had eroded from six to ten feet during the preceding 35 years. Since Mr. Bertelson had collected over 1,000 finished artifacts and over a bushel of other artifact material during fifteen or sixteen of those years, in four or five visits to the spit a week, the total bulk of material must be large, indicat ing either a very rich stratum or a deposit of some depth. Even if the deposit were deep, slow erosion of the sort which is taking place on the spit might disturb only the uppermost of the artifact-bearing strata. On the other hand, clam ming must disturb the sand to a depth of several feet and tidal undercutting could go consider ably deeper than that. Although no geological data are available, it seems plausible to suppose that the spit had sunk before the building of Old Man House, so that the sterile layer repre sents the period between sinking and rehabita tion. Indirect contact between the people of Su quamish and bearers of European culture prob ably dates from the latter part of the eighteenth century, but direct contact for Suquamish can hardly have occurred much before Seattle was founded in 1851. Continuous contact could not have been until some years after this. The transi tion to iron tools was probably completed by 1880, for the Indians of this region were eager for them from their first introduction. In brief, the best that can be done on the basis of the available information is to assign the artifacts of the Bertelson Collection to the middle of the nineteenth century and earlier?how much earlier it would be impossible to say with any assur ance, yet there is reason to believe that the period covered by the artifacts is longer rather than shorter. As mentioned earlier, Mr. Bertelson picked up almost a bushel of chips and worked frag ments, showing that manufacture was carried on at the spot. The chips are predominantly basalt, many of them from ball-like chunks two to three inches in diameter and apparently waterworn on the outside. Flint chips with a wide color range do occur but not in proportion to the number of colorful flint points recovered. This might indicate that many of the flint pieces were traded in already made. The matter of trade is of extreme importance. Wickersham believed that little stone suitable for chipping was to be found in western Wash ington but mentions "specimens which seem to be of local manufacture."6 Bertelson writes: "I really believe after walking these beaches for so many years . . . that at least 90 per cent of the stone chipped here was imported. . . ."7 Ethnological evidence indicates that workers in stone obtained their own materials from small deposits one to four or five days' journey inland from their home villages8 and, at the same time, notes trade and social contacts with peoples east of the Cascades. Flint similar to that in Suquam ish artifacts is found along the Columbia and deposits of basalt are frequent, especially to the north. Only a careful comparison of reck materials could do anything toward finally set tling the question. Over 75 per cent of the chipped pieces are basalt; and 17 per cent are of "flint," a term used to cover allied minerals, such as chert, jasper, agate, and chalcedonies, of a wide range of color. Flint appears most frequently in chipped points but even among these artifacts 56 per cent are basalt. The average of workmanship is probably higher in the flint pieces but, since many of the basalt points are as delicate and as well finished as any of the flints, the differ ence would not seem to be significant. By far the most frequent single artifact is the basalt scraper or knife (see below, Chipped Stone, IV) and, although none of these are beautiful in form, many of them are of exceptionally thin flakes and show excellent workmanship in re touching. The outstanding characteristic of the points is a tendency to asymmetry. 6 Wickersham, 1900, p. 145. 7 Bertelson, communication. 8 M. W. Smith, field notes.</page><page sequence="11">smith 1 ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 7 A few pieces show a combination of chipping and grinding. Ground points are, however, typi cally absent, the only frequent specimens of ground stone consisting of celts or adz blades. There are no examples of carving. Scattered pieces of bone, antler, and metal occur. The collection was studied in two sections: materials collected prior to November, 1938; and those collected between that date and the spring of 1941. Although the latter section showed a percentage of stemmed points slightly smaller than in the first lot, 26 per cent as compared to 34 per cent, the distributions of types were not materially changed. There had, likewise, been no increase in the number of ground points. The collection, therefore, has been treated as a whole in the following descriptions, without reference to the time of finding. CHIPPED STONE I. A heavy, flat, waterworn pebble (13 X 8 cm.) is reminiscent of the "throwing stones" of the Dalles-Deschutes region.9 It is shaped somewhat like Strong, Schenck, and Steward's Plate 19, i, but closer inspection indicates that it belongs to some other category of implement. One face is flat over its entire surface, the other is flat for about half the surface, along one side, then slopes downward so that the opposite side is sharpened. The rim appears to have been rubbed relatively smooth either by man or natu ral water-action. Since the thick side fits well in the palm10 and the sharpened side shows definite signs of battering, this may have been a chopper or celt. II. Perhaps similar in function are large, heavy pieces of shale (P),11 roughly square in shape, although tending to frequent irregularities. I do not remember seeing these but Bertelson writes that they were "crudely battered into shape" and numbers 49 of them. III. Six other pieces are of the same material and as crudely chipped, three of them being larger (Fig. 3,13) and three smaller (Fig. 3, 15). They have a rough cutting edge all around. 9 Strong, Schenck, and Steward, 1930, pp. 89-90; Steward, 1928. 10 In descriptions of material culture from living in formants of this area (M. W. Smith, 19406, p. 298, etc.) ''fitting into the hand," or "fitting the thumb," etc., is a constantly recurring refrain. It does not seem too far fetched, therefore, to apply it to these artifacts. "Bertelson describes this as "lighter than the basalt and of different texture" and thinks it is of local origin. IV. There are 24 rectangular (Fig. 3, 14) and 48 square (Fig. 3, 12) scrapers or knives. Occa sionally, these tend to irregularities or rounded corners but, on the whole, are symmetrical. One additional scraper is symmetrically oval and three are oval with one side flattened. All are of basalt. They tend to be thin, a few achieving an almost razor edge. Many are badly waterworn and sev eral are patinated. There are, likewise, 408 basalt chips which . have been worked enough to give them a cutting edge. V. Nine scrapers, all of flint (2.5-5 x 2-2.7 cm.; thickness 0.9-1.5), are heavy like some of those from the Dalles-Deschutes region12 and have a convex cutting edge. Unlike Dalles Deschutes scrapers, however, they are pure NBc in form and are worked on all surfaces, although one face tends to be flat. A tenth flint is similar except for its small size (2 x 0.7 cm.). Another scraper, also of flint, differs only in that it has a concave cutting edge. VI. One small, white flint scraper is of a type figured for the Dalles-Deschutes region.13 It is, however, more perfectly ovoid in outline. VII. One large piece of grey flint (6.7 x 4.8 cm.) is shaped like an NBb point but the tip, only slightly blunted, forms a beveled cutting edge. The base is concave almost to a right angle and the resulting corners are sharpened to a knife edge. Part of the surface of one face may have been ground and the base corners show grinding on either face to sharpen them, although the chipping of the edges is not obliterated. VIII. One thick flint chip with natural frac ture on both faces and decided curvature, has one face chipped into a heavy beveled cutting edge. It is roughly rectangular. IX. Twenty-four basalt pieces, fairly homo geneous in size, apparently stand halfway between scrapers and drills. Bertelson has suggested that they might have been used to open clams. Con sidering the great importance of fresh and smoked clams in the diet during the historic period, this seems not unlikely. Several of these are pati nated. All are rather roughly made and the out lines are sometimes irregular. Strong, Schenck, and Steward list ten artifacts for the Dalles-Deschutes region which they de scribe as "flattish chips, flaked on one side only to form an obtuse bevel all around the edge. 12 Strong, Schenck, and Steward, 1930, pp. 86-7. 13 Ibid., Fig. 12.</page><page sequence="12">8 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 6 There is more or less of a point somewhere on the circumference which makes some specimens resemble drills. In others, corners are so square and the piece so irregular in shape that they might be classed as asymmetric points. Other wise they resemble the scraper just described more than anything else and may simply be aberrant forms."14 The illustration given by Strong, Schenck, and Steward15 does not show the likeness, but articles like those of their plate occurred, and the written descriptions are strik ingly similar. Many of the Bertelson specimens of this group are so waterworn as to make it difficult to determine whether they have been touched on one or both faces; some have cer tainly been touched on only one, others as cer tainly on both. This may be less relevant to the type than the peculiar half drill, half point form. It is noteworthy that nine of the ten of this type found in the Dalles-Deschutes region were from the Wakemap mound where they were dis tributed throughout. At least a couple of the Bertelson Suquamish pieces of this type could have served as a compass with which to engrave a circle. I tried this with two of the pieces and obtained the circle with a dot in the center typical of much bone decoration in the region.16 Others of these points were not available at the time but this hypothesis seems well worth test ing. X. Three flints, approximating NBa points in form, with base lines sharpened like scrapers, have points roughly circular in cross section, resembling the bores of drills. XI. Ten pieces of flint (Fig. 3, 11) have points, or bores (?), which are triangular in cross section. Each of these likewise has two concave scraper edges, one smaller than the other, as shown in the figure. The piece figured, of red jasper, has been chipped from a fragment of some well polished article. All of the others show natural fractures on one or both sides; in those which show only one fracture the corre u Ibid., p. 87. 13 Ibid., PL 16,2. 1(1 See M. W. Smith, 1946. sponding face has been ground smooth, the work manship being fairly rough. The chipping of the tips and concave edges, however, is well done. These pieces may be a variant of the type from the Dalles-Deschutes region called by Strong, Schenck, and Steward "gravers"17 and pictured by them in Plate 16, k and I. XII. Several small, very delicate flints show a combination of grinding and fine chipping. On one crescent-shaped piece (4 cm. long) the inner curve has been ground and the rest is beautifully chipped, with one end tapering to a blunted point, semicircular in cross section. The edges are at angles to the inner curve and it is diffi cult to see how this could have served as a scraper. The ground, inner curve is very gradual but the chipped, outer curve is sharp, almost cornered. The piece suggests one of the barbs of a composite harpoon or fish spear. Two pieces of peculiarly mottled flint, the only examples of this formation, have been fash ioned into scrapers with ground faces and chipped cutting edges. The chipping is from one face only. One curved flake has been ground on both faces. It is rectangular with a dull ground bevel on one end and sides sharpened by chipping from one face. The remaining end shows chipping from both faces but is dull. Two blunted NBa pieces show natural frac ture on one face, the remaining face has been ground, apparently after preliminary chipping, and the cutting edges sharpened by chipping from one face.

Among the NBa points, for instance, the size range was fairly great but one group of points seemed smaller and more deli cate ("small" as compared to "large-medium"), and within the group of larger points different proportions of length to breadth divided the points into two groups (proportionately "long" and proportionately "wide"). The points were meas ured after they had been classified so that the size groupings are descriptive of apparent differences, as are the classification types themselves. All measurements are maximal.</page><page sequence="15">smith! ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 11 which four types have been added: NBaX, SAbX, SBaX, and SBbx. These are described below, ap pearing in order with some remarks on special aspects of the types as represented in the Suquam ish materials. Comparisons between the points and those from other areas are given in the sec tion on Chipped Points and Classification Systems. NAbl. Three of these points are curved at the tip, the curvature showing in cross section (Fig. 2, 1); each of the curved points has a line of chipping suggesting a bevel on the left side of the up-curved face. These suggest a curved knife, a conclusion which is strengthened by the presence of such an iron tool with a curved tip in the historic culture of the same part of Puget Sound.20 NBa. All of the representatives of this type have defi nitely pointed tips, but in many cases one face is straight at the base with a bevel across the other face, forming a sharpened scraper-like base line. NBaX. The base of these points is asymmetrical, mak ing the length of one side greater than that of the other. They tend to convex bases and slightly rounded corners. Several are patinated. NBal. The notching in the basalt pieces is very shallow. The longer basalt point has such an asymmetrical base that one side is 4 mm. longer than the other. The bases of the other two are straight. Each of the three points has a definite depression at the base on one face. NBc. The corners of these points are rounded, making the class as a whole merge into NAbl. One small chert is blunt pointed. The largest basalt piece is heavily patinated. NE. In the basalt piece only the edges are chipped. The shale point has a chipped longitudinal groove (39 mm.) in the center of one face, the groove not extending to either end of the piece. SA a. All of these points show a tendency to asym metry (Fig. 2, 22-4, 26). They are generally thick and heavy. The only perfectly symmetrical piece is that with projections similar to the Dalles-Deschutes type (Fig. 2, 25). SAb. Some of these snow a tendency to asymmetry. The single very large point is asymmetrical. One chert piece (Fig. 2, 29) is markedly shield-shaped. SAbX. The barbs of these points are strongly accented. In some cases there is asymmetry with one barb more heavily accented than the others (Fig. 2, 30). SBa. The shoulders of these points are sometimes asym metrical (Fig. 2, 32). SBaX. These points have exceptionally wide stems and shallow shoulders. SBbX. The barbs of this type are strongly accented, occasionally asymmetrical (Fig. 2, 37), cf. SAbX. One point (Fig. 2, 38) has such a wide stem that it might be placed in a separate group, cf. SBaX. SCc. This point has a blunt tip. 20 M. W. Smith, 19406, p. 275. XIV. A thin, rectangular conglomerate (66 x 14 mm.) is chipped on all faces and broken at both ends. It might conceivably have been a wedge. GROUND STONE I. Mention has already been made of grinding used in combination with chipping (Chipped Stone, VII, XI, and XII). As a whole, this was poor, apparently showing, since it was often used in conjunction with natural fracture, more in terest in the smooth finish attainable than in particular forms or shapes. The workmanship in Chipped Stone, VII, is more like whetting than true grinding or polishing. A ground cutting edge appeared on several natural flakes, and one of these was exactly like a piece from Lytton.21 II. Only four points of ground stone were found, none of them complete. Two are leaf shaped and much alike in size; for the most complete, see Figure 3, 8. The tip of a much larger point shows fine polishing but its form is indeterminate. The fourth is the base section of an NBb point (Fig. 3, 7). All are of basaltic formation. One additional ground point, of ser pentine, was found in the earth of the spit dur ing excavation for a post hole. III. By far the most abundant ground stone artifact is the adz blade, wedge, or celt. Thirty seven fragments of varying sizes show work of this kind. When ground artifacts slivered, the fragments seem frequently to have been re worked. There are, in addition, nineteen more or less complete adz blades, all with sides which taper gradually from the blade end toward a gently convex base. The blade is made with planes from both faces or from only one face, which are sometimes shallow7, occasionally a full inch deep. These pieces can be roughly classified into three groups according to proportions of length and width: (a) those in which the length is only slightly greater than the width of the blade, giving a stumpy, almost square effect (one of this type has a definitely slanted, rather than straight, cutting edge); (b) those in which the length is approximately twice the width of the blade (this is the most numerous type); and (c) those in which the length is greater than twice the blade, making a slender, rather elegant tool (examples of this type seem, also, to be carefully worked). 21 H.

The base line is indeterminate. A single, almost perfect specimen is slender, with sides tapering to a blunted point (Fig. 3,0). In his study of historic Northwest Coast adz forms, Olson22 finds adz blades of little value for classification. In the part of the Northwest Coast discussed here, he describes the blades as small; of bone, shell, or stone; and equipped with wooden handles. These handles he finds to be of most value for classification of types. He dis tinguishes three: straight, elbow, and D-shaped. The D-adz is found from southern Alaska to the Columbia River and in from the coast only among the Lillooet and Thompson; the straight adz does not occur north of the strait of Juan de Fuca, and the elbow type not south of Puget Sound. On the basis of this distribution and other data, Olson suggests that the D-adz has its place of origin within the area of its distribution, pos sibly in the Kwakiutl-Nootka region on Van couver Island, and that the elbow and straight adzes have no immediate historic connections. It is to be noted that these latter types fuse or overlap within the Columbia-Fraser region which, therefore, knew all three types. Adzes illustrated by Olson for our area show blades of varying lengths but there is no suggestion that they represent consistent types for the localities to which they are allocated. On the archaeological level, adz blades similar to Type (b), Bertelson, are reported from the beach near the Schwenn site in Oregon; a bone blade from the Schwenn site23 is almost exactly this type, and a stone one from Eburne on the lower Fraser24 approximates it. This form of adz is, also, the one mentioned by Wickersham as a common archaeological find in western Washing ton.25 The objects called wedges or chisels by Strong, Schenck, and Steward20 may be compar able to what have here been called adz blades, but even if this is so, their number is surprisingly small. Adz blades of the Bertelson types are com pletely absent from the Dalles-Deschutes ma terials and have a clearly northern provenience. Adz blades appear in profusion among the Mc "Olson, 1927. 23 Leatherman and Krieger, 1940, PI.

Clallum Middle Fraser artifacts to be described later, including adz Types I and III from Druck er's more northern work27 and also including a fourth type not described by him. Adz blades in the Columbia-Fraser region belong to what de Laguna has called "planing" adzes,28 as opposed to more northern "splitting" adzes of Haida, Tsimshian, and Tlingit, and they occur in a pro fusion of types. Interesting results might come from a thorough study of them. IV. One piece, which I have not seen, is de scribed as a wedge by Bertelson: "a large excel lent wedge . . . exactly twelve inches long, two inches wide and five-eighths of an inch thick. It has a rounded groove running down one side." V. Figure 3, 10, shows the upper section of a maul, a well worked conglomerate. A second of the same type is larger and more roughly made. These two and a "phallic pestle" are the only examples of such artifacts and there are no mortars or fragments of mortars in the col lection. Both mortars29 and mauls30 are noted for the historic culture of the southern Sound where they figured among the few items of prop erty inherited in the blood line31 and were care fully preserved from generation to generation. Only after a destructive break, as in the case of these maul heads, would they be discarded. Sam Wilson32 affirmed this conclusion for the particu lar area of the site; mauls, pestles, and mortars were "too valuable to get lost." It must be re membered also that unbroken pieces of this sort might be so heavy as not to be easily carried by wave action. Bertelson Suquamish mauls are apparently like those found in shell heaps of the lower Fraser by Smith33 and cited as typical of Puget Sound by Wickersham.34 Eells35 gives detailed descriptions of mauls from the southern part of our region all of which do not seem to fit these categories.

Ground stone clubs are also ab sent but are known to have existed historically in some places in the area.36 In southern, his toric Puget Sound culture, clubs were used only by warriors, a professional group, and were either handed over to a younger man who would fol low in the owner's footsteps or, at the owner's death, hidden in the woods, i.e. intentionally lost to habitation sites or other accumulations of cultural debris.37 Stone pipes, or fragments of them, do not occur in the collection. There are, likewise, no ex amples of carving in stone or of stone decorated by incising, etc. Sinkers are also absent. The absence of beads or small perforated discs may be partly due to the fact that shell and historic glass are relatively fragile. However, I collected several cylindrical bone beads on the upper Sound among the Nisqually and if beads of this type were also used at Suquamish they are durable enough to withstand considerable water action. During the historic period, all jewelry was valuable, the word for one precious shell actually meaning "well cared for," and would not ordinarily be found in cultural refuse. But beads were often laid with the body at death, and burial or disposal sites of the historic culture should be rich in bead materials, whether shell, bone, or glass. BONE, ANTLER, AND METAL I. Bone artifacts are not common among the Suquamish specimens. Considering that all of the items of the collection have been washed up by wave action this is not, perhaps, surprising. Yet, being light, bone might be expected to come in as readily as stone. It does, however, soften up through the action of salt water and, although it may reharden, could be easily broken up by wave action. Several of the pieces which do exist are of excellent workmanship and in good condition. Of the eighteen bone pieces, one is a wedge (?) (Fig. 3, 1); one (Fig. 3, 2) is similar to a piece pictured from the Dalles-Deschutes region38 and called by Strong, Schenck, and Steward an "awl"; one is a fishhook (Fig. 3, 3); one, a 36 Boas, 1904, pp. 412-18; Hill-Tout and Kidd, 1932; H.

II. Seven fragments of antler, apparently wedges, have been found. These are in a poor state of preservation. III. A piece of worked copper (Fig. 3, 6) is paper thin, with a perforation at the base end, and shallow side notching. One small fragment of worked copper was found but cannot be identified. It was more chunky than flat. DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD In January, 1939, the Old Man House spit yielded a human skull about two-thirds com plete. It came out in sections but the jaw was nearly intact, containing five well preserved teeth which were exceedingly worn. Bertelson reports that the bone was coated with the ash of the regular fill and seems to have been located in situ. Only one other small fragment of human skull was found along the beach line with the artifacts. Skeletal materials, therefore, seem not to have been frequent among the Suquamish re mains. It is reported that while widening a road some seven or eight years ago, workmen uncovered a grave on the high ground behind the Old Man House spit. They first noticed it when their road scraper hit a pile of stones which on examination proved to be waterworn beach rocks bearing in dications of barnacles. Among these rocks they found a skeleton with deformed head. No arti facts or ornaments were found with the skeleton but these might have passed unnoticed. The posi tion of the body was not noted. According to re port, a number of graves were formerly located at this place, the bodies having been moved to the cemetery when the Christian Church was founded at Suquamish. Since this report was heard only after the grave was found, it may or may not be trustworthy. The method of burial is sugges tive of cairns mentioned to the west and north by Reagan40 and for the vicinity of Victoria, on Point Roberts, the San Juan Islands, and on Whidbey Island, by Smith and Fowke.41 These 39Drucker, 1943, p. 41. 40 Reagan, 1917. 41 Smith and Fowke, 1901.</page><page sequence="19">smith] ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 15 cairns held few or no artifacts. Smith and Fowke state that no cairns have been found in the north ern part of Vancouver Island or in Washington south of Coupeville.42 But Reagan established their presence on the west coast and, if the de scription given for Suquamish refers to a similar burial custom, the southern limit of the cairn area is now extended. In the historic period, shed burial and raised canoe disposal were generally practiced, al though they do not always seem to have oc curred together. Whether or not anything could be made of their distribution by extreme atten tion to detail is not certain. More interesting, perhaps, is a record of reburial from the south ern Columbia-Fraser region.43 Box burial with painted and carved boards is reported from the middle Columbia and from the middle Fraser but from nowhere else in the region, although it occurs among the Coast Salish of the Straits of Georgia and on northward.44 42 Ibid., p. 58. 43 M. W. Smith, 19406, pp. 201-05. Cf. Haeberlin and Gunther, 1930, pp. 54-5. 44 M. W. Smith, 1946, pp. 311, 316-17, etc. Wicker Strong, Schenck, and Steward excavated a cremation pit in the Dalles-Deschutes region on the middle Columbia45 but that the cultural ma terials from others of their excavations are to be associated with it remains doubtful at best. Reagan found apparent signs of cremation in Quilliute sites and, in the same location, burials in which a foot or more of loose ash covered the corpse.46 These he took to be indications of grave goods burned above the body, and such a custom might well give archaeological evidence of cremation where no true cremation was in tended. Somewhere "on Vancouver Island," Rea gan also found evidence that "cremation was practiced in early graves" and found charcoal at the bottom of other graves, which he again took to be due to the burning of "personal belong ings."47 Cremation is not reported for the Co lumbia-Fraser region in the historic period. sham (1896) mentions seeing mortuary houses on both the west coast of Vancouver Island and at Queets with American-made windows. 45 Strong, Schenck, and Steward, 1930. 4&lt;!

A large habitation site is lo cated on the farm on a ridge facing what may once have been a water connection between Har rison Lake and the Fraser River. This habitation site was mapped in 1945, and has been described elsewhere.1 In that year, the Columbia University Summer Field Party studied the collection and introduced Mr. McClallum to Mr. A. E. Pickford, then of the Provincial Museum, Victoria, who joined the party for a few days. The collection was moved to the museum under his direction. The collection consists of about a hundred items including 25 bone pieces, some bone and antler fragments, a tooth fragment, a few tubu lar clay beads one to two inches long, and 63 stone specimens. The level of workmanship is very high indeed, although all the pieces were not made with equal care. Most spectacular are slim, finely chipped blades, some six or seven inches long, which it seems natural to call dag gers. Of equal interest are fine polished stone ulos, some four inches long and as thin through out as light cardboard. Both chipped and pol ished stone pieces occur in a number of forms. Nine flint thumb-nail scrapers of the same form (with fracture on one side, oval tending toward triangular) are of the only type which is exactly duplicated among more than three or four speci mens. Most pieces are unique. The richness and variety of this collection al most defy complete analysis in the present state of our knowledge of Northwest Coast archae ology. It adds to the difficulty when one considers that, although all of the pieces were collected within the relatively small area of the McClallum farm, there is no necessary association between them in point of view of time. On the coast, the Fraser roughly marks the southern limit of pol ished stone, and chipped artifacts hardly occur north of Comox. Yet in this collection from some 80 miles up the river, the two techniques are equally well represented. According to in formants, all stone tools used locally were pol ished and when some of the chipped pieces from the collection were shown to one old man, he 1 M. W. Smith, 1947, pp. 259-64. claimed they were unfinished. "Smooth them down," he said. The polished points, on the other hand, he immediately recognized as similar to those used by his father. It should also be noted that the McClallum habitation site was not known to any of our informants from Seabird Reserve. Because of its location, peoples of the site probably would have had closer ties with villages of lower Harrison Lake than with the river villages, but the presence of chipped points may indicate differences in time level as well as local areal differences. It is also worth noting that, although some of the artifacts in the collection were surface finds, this is by no means true of all specimens. The time span covered by the collection may, there fore, be considerable. The items of the collection were numbered before they were removed to the Provincial Museum and, using those numbers for identification, it may be well to list below some information obtained from Mr. McClallum re garding the discovery of particular pieces. One chipped point (Mc 2) was found on the bench of the habitation site along the road. It was six inches deep in the clay but, because they were then clearing, Mr. McClallum could not be sure whether the clay had been previously undisturbed or not. One basalt point (Mc 33, 5 x 17 x 35 mm.) was found in a two-foot fir log in the slough. The log had six inches of undisturbed soil above it and when it was moved the piece fell out. The wood was marked where it had been. Five adz blades (Mc 34, 35, 36, 37, 38), a ground point (Mc 50), and a maul fragment (Mc 51) were found in the slough at the foot of the habitation site. The slough is now ditched and a number of the artifacts were found while this work was in progress. The ones listed here could be definitely identified. An old beaver swamp was associated with the slough and the original was dammed by silt from the Fraser. Four ground points (Mc 43, 45, 48, and 49) were found in one "set" on the habitation site not far from the excavated house site. Fuller treatment of the McClallum collection may better be reserved for the future. Various references to it in passing have been incorporated in the discussion of types which follows. 16</page><page sequence="21">NOTES ON CHIPPED POINTS AND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS CHIPPED stone points are now classified ac cording to a scheme suggested by Thomas Wilson in 1898, worked out by Gifford and Schenck in 1926, and carefully modified by Strong in 1935. Part of Strong's modification de veloped from his earlier work in the Dalles Deschutes region. The classification is based upon analysis of form. The presence or absence of a stem, indicated by S- and N- respectively, is used as the primary basis for division with the shape of the stem secondary. In discussing the Dalles-Deschutes points, Strong, Schenck, and Steward question the validity of the particular elements selected: "There remains some question whether the shape of the stem ... or the presence of a shoulder or barb . . . should be chosen for secondary classification. We endeavor to present data so that either may be used."1 If a classifica tion is to be used for various areas, questions such as this of the relative significance of certain ele ments for particular areas are bound to come up. A perfect chipped point classification would be designed to give all the elements of form so they could be used to any purpose. It should be noted, however, that the form considered for the usual classification is completely two-dimen sional, resulting in a description of the point which is really a description of silhouette. Certain difficulties arise in the use of any classificatory system. For instance, Suquamish SAa points which are consistently asymmetric (Fig. 2, 22, 23, 24) are not pure SAa in form. Using the chart drawn by Strong, Schenck, and Steward for Dalles-Deschutes, and Drucker's original division of the Suquamish points, I classified later points of this type as SAa. Yet, in a recent w7ork on the upper Columbia River just east of our area, Collier, Hudson, and Ford picture an identical point from the surface at Laurier2 and classify it as NAa. No points of the type of Suquamish Figure 2, 22, and Laurier, appear in the Dalles-Deschutes materials. Points with somewhat different outline are also classi fied as NAa in Collier, Hudson, and Ford's Plate I, and there are eleven NAa points listed3 from 1 Strong, Schenck, and Steward, 1930, p. 80. 'Collier, Hudson, and Ford, 1942, PI. I, L. "Ibid., Table 3, p. 62. four excavated sites in their region (24, 31, 46, and 49), so that it is not possible to gauge either the distribution or the frequency of the type. Laurier is at the extreme northwest of the area covered by Collier, Hudson, and Ford. Site 24 is at the extreme south near Dalles-Deschutes and 49 is at the north and east. The possible distribution of this type point, therefore, covers all of the area under discussion and there is no way of checking its actual distribution short of going to the specimens themselves. Dependence upon a classificatory scheme is apt to lead to obscurities of this sort, and it is gen erally recognized that the difficulties are offset by certain of the advantages of classification. A more fundamental difficulty in the use of the chipped point classification is its lack of complete standardization. Strong's 1935 modification has received widest acceptance. But two of the major publications in southern Northwest Coast archae ology have used rather different diagrams or charts on which to base their analyses. These diagrams are reproduced in Figure 4. A glance will show that Strong, Schenck, and Steward's 1930 diagram (Fig. 4, A) illustrates consistently narrow-stemmed points whereas Collier, Hudson, and Ford's 1942 diagram (Fig. 4, B) gives points with wide stems and consistently narrow shoul ders or barbs. It is difficult to tell from the photographs accompanying each report whether or not these diagrammatic differences reflect real differences in the stemmed points of the Dalles Deschutes and upper Columbia regions.4 From work with the Bertelson materials I should think it probable that differences in width of stem might prove of diagnostic value. Much more confusing than any such differ ences in proportion in these diagrams is the fact that they give one classificatory tag to two ap parently distinct forms. To call Strong, Schenck, and Steward's NAM the same as Collier, Hudson, and Ford's NAbl stretches the credulity of the classifier. It might also be somewhat difficult to know from Collier, Hudson, and Ford's diagram whether to place a particular point as NAbl or 4 Point classification for King's excavations in the San Juan Islands was not available when this was written (King, 1950). 17</page><page sequence="22">oo Table 2.

This is especially significant since they classify more than twice as many of their points as NAbl than as anything else (96 NAbl as com pared to the next largest group of 36 SCb2).5 The same difficulties arose in using the regular "Collier, Hudson, and Ford, 1942, Table 3, p. 62. classifications for chipped projectile points on the artifacts of the McClallum Middle Fraser Collection. In this case, even more doubt was cast on the two-dimensional classification because of striking differences in profile thickness and be cause of variations in thickness in one piece.

Yet there seemed no adequate reason for group ing some of the specimens outside of the point classification. To classify these materials ade quately seemed to call for a complete restudy of the specimens figured in the literature and a fairly thorough reworking of classificatory schemes. Because of these difficulties Table 2, the Com parative Table of Chipped Points, should be used with some caution. In the table, points cited in the publications for the area were first classified from descriptions or figures, then counted "pres ent" if no remark as to their frequency was made, or described with the word used by the author, i.e. "many." The Dallas-Deschutes ma terial has been rearranged on the table to show Wakemap, the cremation pit, and Site 19, the Miller's Island prehistoric village site, separately. Figures for total or "general" Dalles-Deschutes were also computed by combining the materials from all sites. The Oregon sites are listed accord ing to the site names used by the archaeologists who described the materials. Three facts stand out in the Bertelson ma terials: the relative scarcity of stemmed points, the practical absence of expanded stems, and the emphasis upon triangular points. Percentages of stemmed and triangular points show clearly that General Dalles Bertelson Wakemap Deschutes Triangular (NB-) 63% 22% 2% Stemmed (S-) 32% 73% 82% Bertelson Suquamish is more akin to Wakemap than to general Dalles-Deschutes, though the differences are still considerable. Points from the cremation pit are too few to be definitive but their distribution among the types seems to indi cate that the cremation pit was not closely re lated to either Wakemap or Bertelson Suquamish. Since so many of the individual points from Suquamish looked very like Columbia River points, the marked differences in proportion be tween general Dalles-Deschutes and Suquamish types is all the more striking. These differences assume possible meaning when they are compared with Oregon data from south of the Columbia. The table shows a preponderance of stemmed types for the Oregon sites, as well as for Dalles Deschutes, against which the heavy weighting of Suquamish in favor of triangular points may have real significance. Expanding stems (SC-) may be considered normally absent from Bertelson Suquamish, be ing represented by only four specimens. However, these form the dominant type of the cremation pit, are important for Harrisburg, and occur widely and in various forms among both Wake map and general Dalles-Deschutes material. The table also shows them to be present in the Yakima Valley, in Saanich, and in lower Fraser sites. The importance of triangular points in Bertel son Suquamish is coupled with a scarcity of leaf shaped blades. This holds true likewise of the Wakemap material whereas in the general Dalles Deschutes region leaf shapes are the most com mon of the not-stemmed specimens, forming over 15 per cent of the whole. Leaf shapes appear to be one of the characteristics of the Thompson and lower Fraser rivers, are present in the Yakima Valley, and were dominant at Schwenn south of the Columbia. Although NB- points are by far the most usual in Bertelson Suquamish, less than 5 per cent of them show notching. None of the Dalles-Deschutes NB- points were notched. But notched triangular points were fre quent in the Thompson River finds and occurred both along, the lower Fraser and in the San Juan Islands. The NB- points reported from Comox and Penn Cove were apparently not notched al though, since they number only three complete pieces and a fragment, the question of relative notching in these two places remains an open question. Triangular points seem to be quite un important south of the Columbia in our region. The Yakima notched triangular points with concave base illustrated by H. I. Smith are al most identical with those found in the Bertelson Collection. In both, the concavity is deep and the sides so extended that the tips become reminiscent of barbs. Fifty-nine per cent of stemmed points in Bertelson Suquamish are barbed as against 48 per cent in the general Dalles-Deschutes and 36 per cent in Wakemap. Even by taking only those points which occur in Wakemap, Pit L. below 2.7 m., the percentage of stemmed speci mens which are also barbed is 31. Although show ing a decreasing interest in barbs, these differ ences are not clear enough to warrant any conclusions. It is interesting, however, that lower Fraser finds seem lacking in barbed chipped points. The points (SAa, SCa) especially noted in the Dalles-Deschutes region as bearing "small sharp, prong-like projections . . . just above the shoul</page><page sequence="25">smith] ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 21 ders,"6 and which constitute over 60 per cent of all chipped points found in the cremation pit, Site 21, are also illustrated by Smith for Yakima (SCa).7 The two SC- stems from the Bertelson Collection do not agree with this description but four of the SAa points belong clearly to the type. McClallum Middle Fraser finds also included an SAa point with similar projections. These types also "predominate" at Harrisburg, though noth ing is said of protuberances. SA- points are most important for Oregon sites. Serrated edges occur in Bertelson Suquamish but are neither frequent nor particularly marked. The fantastically notched forms of the Thompson and upper Fraser8 did not show up in the McClallum Middle Fraser Collection. The relation between serrated edges, notches, and barbs and the projected shoulders described above does not appear to be significant. On the other hand, the distribution of notched triangular points is suggestive. It looks as though notching spread from the Thompson area west to the lower Fraser and south to Yakima. The absence of these points at Dalles-Deschutes suggests both that their spread to Yakima, and from Yakima east to Suquamish, was recent and that it was due to direct contact between Yakima and Suquamish. Such contact is further abundantly demonstrated in the lifetime of Sam Wilson at Suquamish, who owned a tanned deer hide dress which had belonged to his Yakima grandmother. It also seems reasonable to suppose that similar points will have followed other routes east to other parts of the coast. But unless notched tri angular points are later demonstrated to be old on Puget Sound, their presence on Sound sites may well be taken to be indicative of recency. Most data from the Columbia-Fraser region are given without information on stratigraphy. Such information is furnished, however, for Wakemap in the Dalles-Deschutes region. Thirty of 36 chipped points in Pit L, Wakemap, were triangular (NB-) or parallel stemmed (SB-). In both pits of Wakemap the shallow stratum from 2.4 m. through 2.7 m. yielded 37 points, showing a slight increase: 84 per cent as com pared to 61 per cent in the lower stratum. In the next stratum of Wakemap chipped stone concen tration, 1.2 to 0.75 m., 72 per cent of 22 points from Pit L were stemmed, and NA- blades had '"' Strong, Schenck, and Steward, 1930, p. 76. 7 H. I. Smith, 1910, PI. IL 8 H. I. Smith, 19006, p. 136. disappeared. NB- points decreased toward the top, and SC- points were typical of the upper strata, 25 of 29 SC- points occurring at the 2.7 level or above. It is clear that different concen trations of chipped stone types characterize the various Wakemap strata distinguished by Strong, Schenck, and Steward, but their significance is not easy to discern, partially because of the rela tively few points involved. Despite the difficulties inherent in the present classification schemes for chipped points, enough positive results have been obtained here from even the small amount of comparative work possible on available data to demonstrate the real value of classification. Objective means for group ing masses of detail are frequently of major value. On the other hand, some general charac teristics of points from one site or area may well continue to evade classification. The asymmetry of many Bertelson Suquamish points offers an example of such a characteristic. Asymmetry is often attributed to hasty or inexpert workman ship, but some of the most beautifully chipped of Bertelson points show marked asymmetry. Al though asymmetry is greater for some classes of points than others, it occurs frequently enough to be rather typical of the materials. This charac teristic increases in interest when one notes asym metry in points pictured for some neighboring sites. Hill-Tout's plate of Eburne materials from the lower Fraser9 shows asymmetry in several items and pictures one point identical with Bertelson Figure 2, 22. Asymmetric points remi niscent of these are also illustrated for the Lake region of the San Joaquin Valley, California, and it is interesting that the same region, as distinct from Alpaugh in the San Joaquin Valley, favored a triangular point (NBb).10 The Emeryville shell mound on San Francisco Bay which shows a preponderantly bone culture with remarkably few chipped points has at least one point (NAb2) with the same kind of asymmetry as in Figure 2, 22,X1 and two others show similar asymmetry.12 Loud, dealing with Wiyot territory, has already suggested ties between coastal California and Puget Sound,13 and his Plate 15 shows triangular points, barbed parallel and contracting stem points, and wide stemmed points (shouldered, but 9 Hill-Tout, 1938. 10 Gifford and Schenck, 1926, p. 85. 11 Schenck, 1926, PI. 48, g. 12 Ibid., PI. 48, h and k. i:&lt;Loud, 1918, p. 393.</page><page sequence="26">22 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 6 no barbs), all of which are clearly reminiscent of Bertelson Suquamish. The particular asymmetry of Bertelson Suqua mish, seems to be best illustrated by the type point already referred to (Fig. 2, 22). This point turns up again at Eburne and in California, as mentioned above, and at the prehistoric site at Schwenn.14 In all these cases, the same propor tions of length to width are maintained. Yet, to my knowledge, this particular point does not occur in other western North American collec tions. I am inclined, therefore, to credit this point with being one of the diagnostic traits of the culture represented at the Suquamish Old Man House spit. If there are difficulties in the use of the chipped stone classification, it is still more difficult to describe other artifacts objectively and simply. Gifford and Schenck worked out a preliminary classification of scrapers in 1926, but beyond this no other typologies for stone artifacts were available at the time the Bertelson classification was made. In 1943, Drucker published his sur vey of northern Northwest Coast archaeology which includes a classification of various arti 14 Leatherman and Krieger, 1940, Fig. 29. facts of that region, including harpoon points, composite harpoons, fixed bone (or horn) pro jectile points, ground slate points, "splitting" adzes, celts, hafted mauls, hand mauls, bone awls and awl-like forms, bone needles, and bone (or horn) knives. Because of the fact that the regions are geographically contiguous, there was every reason to believe that these would be useful in classifying Columbia-Fraser artifacts. Intensive work with the McClallum Collection, however, led to the unwilling conclusion that these types had to be modified to fit southern Northwest Coast. Full classification of Columbia-Fraser stone and bone artifacts has, therefore, proved impracticable and the materials have not been subjected to such treatment. As is the case in so many anthropo logical studies, we have had to rely upon pure description without reliance upon classification. Detailed comparisons of sites and cultures will have to wait until dependable classification sys tems are available.15 15 Ipiutak and the Arctic Whale Hunting Culture (Larsen and Rainey, 1948) appeared after this paper was written. Its plates and figures show striking similarities to some Columbia-Fraser finds, especially in the McClallum Middle Fraser Collection, and its descriptions of chipped stone artifacts would have gone far to supply the classification system needed to clarify our materials.</page><page sequence="27">SITE SUMMARIES BEFORE turning to a systematic description of the archaeological sites of the Columbia Fraser region, it will be well to review briefly the main sources of information. It may then be possible to bring together various of the sites and, with considerable tentativeness to be sure, associ ate them according to the cultural phases they represent. Some framework for the prehistory of the region may thus be obtained. Judge Wickersham's early data for western Washington led him to believe that it was a poor region "for the development of the Stone Age," and that the Indian "made his implements of bone, shell, or wood, and these scon decayed."1 He goes on, however, to mention mauls, adz blades, clubs, and pipes of polished stone, in addition to chipped points among which "... local forms are rare, but so distinct in character from others, which are so clearly traced to eastern Washington, as to admit of but little doubt as to their local origin."2 He apparently thought the archaeological materials were closely related to the objects used by living Indians. Ties between the peoples east and west of the Cascades were obvious on the ethnological level and Wickersham was, consequently, not surprised to find arrow points on the Sound which were reminiscent of the eastern section of the state. Harlan I. Smith, after considerable work in Washington and British Columbia, also pointed to connections between the areas east and west of the Cascades and, particularly, to likenesses between the chipped points of Puget Sound and those of the Columbia River. On the whole, he found points ground out of stone and bone more numerous than chipped points, with the area of highest culture on the lower Fraser and across from that river on southern Vancouver Island. North of here the occurrence of chipped points decreased sharply and "among the natives of the coast of British Columbia, the art of chipping stone was not practiced."3 Chipping occurred in the upper Fraser and Thompson River countries and chipped points from Saanich and the lower Fraser resembled those of this upriver section. In explanation of this and other distributions, 4Wickersham, 1900, p. 141. 2 Ibid., p. 145. 3H. I. Smith, 1904a, p. 437. See also p. 308. Smith says: "It is probable that at an early time a migration took place from the interior to the coast and to Vancouver Island. The migration carried the art of stone chipping, the use of tubular pipes, and geometric decorative art, to the coast, and in later times the custom of de positing artifacts with the dead."4 On the other hand, the distribution of stone and bone clubs and of a non-geometric art style suggested to Smith that influences from the coast had reached the interior "through the Columbia Valley or the mountain passes immediately north of it, rather than by the more northerly Chilcotin route and Fraser Valley."5 It is important to point out that the art style which filtered east via these more southerly routes was distinct from the classical Northwest Coast art which never ex tended south of Comox nor to the west coast of Vancouver Island and which was associated with the area of ground bone and stone tools. Summing up the situation for Puget Sound, Smith concludes: "the culture of the ancient peoples of the Puget Sound area was in all essen tial particulars similar to that of the tribes at present inhabiting the same area, but it was under much stronger influence from the interior, and affected the culture of the interior both of southern British Columbia and of Washington more in the past than at the present time. It seems that this culture has continued practically unchanged during recent times."6 Using Smith's Fraser materials, Boas found evidence that the original home of the Coast Salish was east of the mountains, a conclusion he later repeated, and that northern ties were also prominent: "Archaeological investigations of the coast indicate that in very early times the cul ture of the southern coast of British Columbia was quite similar to the culture of the northern coast. . . . When comparing the culture of the Coast Salish with that of the interior, we find that both have a number of features in common, and that these points are the ones in regard to which the Coast Salish show a marked difference from their northern neighbors. . . . We may there fore conclude that the period of contact between 'Ibid., p. 439. 5 Ibid., p. 440. 6 Ibid., p. 441. 23</page><page sequence="28">24 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 6 the two groups of people does not cover an exces sively long time. This view is corroborated by a consideration of the art of the Coast Salish whose works are much cruder than those of the north ern tribes."7 Later, Boas wrote: "All this points to a close affiliation of the early culture of the Saanich and Fraser delta with interior British Columbia" and at the same time reiterated the opinion that the scarcity of specimens in Colum bia-Fraser shell heaps reflected the same de pendence upon cedar products characteristic of the historic peoples.8 When Albert Reagan, of the United States Indian Office, was on the reservations of north western Washington, he collected specimens and excavated on the Olympic Peninsula from Hoh to Makah territory and on the northern sound in the Lummi-Nooksack area. Unlike Wickersham and Smith, Reagan was impressed, especially in parts of the area he investigated, by the apparent suc cession of cultures. In his examination, which covered middens, village sites, burial mounds and caves, and oven mounds, he distinguished between "recent" materials, which contained glass beads and other objects of white manufacture, and various stages of pre-white materials, the rela tive age of which he determined by stratification, where present; geological conditions; and by the preservation of associated vegetal and shell fill. Reagan's work is relatively unknown but he de serves considerable credit for the fact that he used criteria not widely used by professional American archaeologists until after his time. On the Olympic Peninsula, he found deep de posits at La Push with bone artifacts through out and noted similar deposits in Hoh territory. He concluded that the Quilliute and Hoh regions had always been occupied by the same people but, on the basis of three distinguishable pre white deposits, that the Ozette-Makah region had seen a succession of at least three cultures.9 The first Makah deposit held numerous stone artifacts similar to those of the historic period but without white goods and with more Pacific oyster shells; the second lay under the first deposit and con tained bone but no stone artifacts; and in the third, similar to the second in deterioration of vegetal and shell fill (?), stone implements were again plentiful. Reagan thought the predomi 7 In H. I. Smith, 1900b, pp. 387-9. See also Kroeber, 1923, p. 17. 8 In H. I. Smith, 1904a, p. 433. "Reagan, 1917, p. 18. nantly bone deposit resembled the deeper de posits of Quilliute territory and infers "an invasion of the region from the north, the in vaders being later driven out by the Quillayutes; or probably they were the first people in the region and they were dispossessed by the latter."10 He says nothing of the provenience of the late Ozette-Makah stone culture, but in speaking of the Clallam region, which lies east of Makah country, mentions that the remains "in dicate that the Clallams have not occupied the region so long as the Makahs have the cape country. Middens on Whidbey Island also seem to show that the Clallams migrated from there to the mainland. The Clallam traditions that they came from the north bear out this tradition."11 In the area of the lower Fraser, neighboring portions of Vancouver Island, and the drainage of the Nooksack and Lummi rivers, Reagan lo cated several distinct types of burial cairn. In the same area, he found a relatively recent, al though pre-white, stone culture and an older, pre dominantly bone culture: . . . the ancient middens are mostly inland, that is, away from the present shore line. The shells of these heaps are in a state of decay and are intermingled with immense quantities of ashes, calcined and broken stones. They are also of considerable thickness, exceeding twenty feet in some instances. They also contain large numbers of barbed and grooved bone spear and arrow points and other bone implements and but few of stone . . . are now all overgrown with an ancient forest. The later middens are usually along the present shore line, are com paratively shallow and are not so rich in relics as the older and more extensive heaps. The shells composing these heaps are usually in a good state of preservation. Also the relics, obtained from them are usually of stone. These are: dull green, gray and mottled jade-like rock and smoky quartz adzes, chisels and axes, dark gray and black basaltic rock and slate stemmed and differentially beveled spear and arrow heads, obsidian knives, stone swords, bone needles, stone pestle hammers, stone bowls and basins in great number and variety.12 This distinction between predominantly bone and stone cultures may be of particular significance. The old bone remains occur also in other places on the lower Fraser. Reagan dates the older cul ture between 150013 and 200014 years ago and Hill-Tout places the early deposits of the Great 10 Ibid., p. 20.

To the south of Puget Sound, the Bullard site on the lower Coquille River, Oregon, yielded a cultural complex rich in bone and antler artifacts but with stone limited to a few scrapers, grooved and pecked, waterworn pebbles, and a single net sinker (ground ?). Stone projectile points were absent. This habitation site ties with historic Lower Coquille and is ascribed by Leatherman and Krieger to the middle of the nineteenth cen tury.17 Upstream on the same river, shallow test pits in the Schwenn site, which shows no signs of white contact, yielded a few bone and antler pieces and comparatively rich stone work includ ing mortars, projectile points, and a fragment of a tubular pipe. Surface collections from the lower Coquille River and neighboring beaches south into Curry County, Oregon, show numerous chipped points.18 On the middle Columbia River in the Dalles Deschutes region, Strong, Schenck, and Steward excavated both burials and habitation sites. Some of the former were pre- and some post-white, and there were large cremation pits which they ascribe to the eve of white influence.19 One defi nitely pre-white village site (Site 19) shows a stone culture with "throwing stones"20 and shoul dered, contracting stemmed points. Bone did not appear at this site, nor was it found in the other sites and materials examined, with the important exception of the cremation pits and Wakemap mound.21 The cremation pits were especially rich in bone work. Wakemap mound showed continu ous occupation over a considerable time span and white goods were limited to its extreme upper stratum. Generally speaking, bone and stone oc curred throughout Wakemap but the stratigraphy of Wakemap's 4.05 m. deposit showed a marked concentration of bone and antler between 2.7 and 2.4 m. deep, indicating "the time of arrival of a 15 Hill-Tout, 1938, p. 7. 16 Menzies, 1938, p. 360. 17 T,e?therman and Krieger, 1940, p.21. 18 Ibid., p. 20. 19 Strong, Schenck, and Steward, 1930, p. 140. 20 Ibid., pp. 89-90; Steward, 1928. 21 Ibid., p. 52. definite stimulus" to work in these materials.22 Chipped stone was also concentrated between 2.7 and 2.4 m. and there was another, slighter con centration between 1.2 and 0.75 m.23 Ground stone showed "a marked impetus ... at about the 1.65 m. level."24 The cremation pits were especially rich in bone and, in addition, showed a complex art in both bone and stone which was also represented at Wakemap at the 1.2 m. level.25 The cremation pits are characterized by a small type of tubular pipe, bone and stone carvings of a definite style, elaborate gaming bones, clubs and other carvings of the bones of sea mammals, bone ear-plugs or labrets, no ground stone work except one small double mortar and pestle, and a small and especially elaborate arrowpoint (special SCa-). Wooden artifacts, shell, and textiles, it might be suspected, have been destroyed by cremation fires. . . . All the foregoing characteristics are scarce or absent in the Wakemap mound. On the other hand, in the Wakemap mound are bone arrowpoints and lance parts, needles, horn wedges, mortars, pestles, mauls, scrapers, sinkers, chisels, and a number of forms of chipped points of which a heavy, rather ill-shaped flint blade (NB-) is most notable. All these are absent from the cremations.26 Despite these differences, the authors feel that the cremation pits are associated with Wakemap: "the cremation pits (may) manifest the cere monial side of a culture which is revealed on its utilitarian side by the Wakemap mound."27 The authors conclude that "the latest occupancy of Wakemap and the cremation pits were more or less contemporary and probably date from the middle of the eighteenth century at the earli est."28 In some instances, Strong, Schenck, and Steward correlate trait complexes with historic language groups and these correlations I shall omit for the purposes of this paper in order not to introduce a third variable into our archaeo logical and ethnological data which are already complex enough. They also draw general conclu sions from a comparison of their materials with surrounding regions which are relevant here: (1) "The practice of cremation originally came into 22 Ibid., p. 68 and Tables 1-6.

In this blending of plateau and coast styles, the latter appears to have been the strong est and must have been derived (in relatively re cent pre-Caucasian times) at least in part through the Chinookan tribes. [There was] . . . a considerable lapse of time during which influ ences from both east and west were acting on the simplified earlier culture represented in the lower levels of the Wakemap mound."30 The sources for western Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia, outlined above, indicate pretty clearly that the major lanes of influence in the Columbia-Fraser region moved north and south, and east and west. Ethnological evidence indicates contact in the same directions, with the major emphasis in the historic period from north to south via salt water routes, and from east to west via river systems and mountain passes. The Columbia River in its southern, then western, course probably served a relatively minor role in recent north to south, and then east to west, contact. The archaeological materials suggest cul tural variations during a constant occupation of the area by non-pottery making food gatherers. Our survey also indicates that three factors must be borne in mind: (1) the possible significance and age of a tradition in carving, (2) the con stant adaptation to a river and marine economy, and (3) the relative predominance of bone and stone tools. 1. The richness of stone and bone carving in the Columbia-Fraser region is seldom appreci ated, because of the scattered nature of the evi dence, yet it is important not only in its own right but also in its connections with the classic high development of Northwest Coast sculpture and painting. It is usual to look for an origin of Northwest Coast arts either in a recent wave of Asiatic influence, or in a migration of peoples from the islands of the south Pacific.31 The availability of wood, and favorable economic con ditions which allowed for leisure, have also been cited as important factors. Strong has recently 29 Ibid., p. 142. 80 Ibid., pp. 143-4. "See, for instance, Krieger, 1931, p. 534. called attention to carvings of stone, bone, and wood in the Columbia-Fraser region,32 and numerous other references might be cited.33 In 1900, Harlan I. Smith illustrated a carved stone figure and said of it, it "resembles . . . stone carvings found on southeastern Vancouver Island, and Lillooet Valley, vicinity of Yale. All these specimens bear a certain resemblance to sculp tures of the region of the Columbia River, the Gulf of Georgia and Puget Sound, and may have originated under the influence of the culture of these districts."34 From work in the Dalles-Deschutes region it seems certain that the expressions of this art found on the middle Columbia River are rela tively recent. Yet the tentative explanation of this late carving quoted above from Strong, Schenck, and Steward seems hardly satisfactory. An explanation in terms of a "blending of plateau and coast styles, the latter [being] . . . strongest and . . . derived (in relatively recent pre Caucasian times) at least in part through the Chinookan tribes" leaves something to be de sired. There is no apparent reason why a people already used to working in wood, upon receiving an impetus toward carving from a people whose work is done primarily in wood, should translate that impetus into carving in stone. It would be easier to understand a people, without large re sources in wood, picking up carving in stone from wood-carving neighbors by a process similar to that called "stimulus diffusion" by Kroeber. There are regions with relatively little wood in the northern Plateau. Under these circumstances, one might better look landward and northward for the cultural ties of the late stone carvers, toward the upper Fraser area cited by Harlan Smith in the quotation above. A more recent theory of middle Columbia art styles sees three major influences at work: a decorative complex based upon the circle-dot motif which in its simple form is apparently old in the region; a semi-realistic complex with two as pects, one of which is purely decorative and comes in the immediate prehistoric period from Nevada and Utah, and the other of which is older and religious, and reaches the middle Columbia from 32 Strong, 1945. 33 For instance, Heizer, 1942; Hill-Tout, 1935; Seaman, 1946; H. I. Smith, 1904a, 1904&amp;, 1917, 1923; M. W. Smith, 1943, 1946; Terry, 1891; Thomas, 1897. Local antique dealers in Vancouver, B.C., have recently had a number of "ancient" carved stone heads for sale. 84 H. I.

A study of the first might well carry the investigator far afield beyond the con fines of our region. But the third, the basic re ligious-artistic complex, seems to carry us deep into the archaeologic problems of the Columbia Fraser region itself. Bone and stone carvings of the Fraser River areas, unlike those of the middle Columbia, ap parently have a respectable antiquity. It is im possible to date surface finds except under the most optimum of conditions but at least some rich examples of carving from the Fraser west of the mountains date well over a thousand years ago if we are to believe the reports of Reagan, Hill-Tout, and Menzies cited above. The spec tacular culture sampled by them in the general neighborhood of the lower Fraser was apparently associated with a shift in physical type.36 This shift paralleled a change reported in other old sites of North America from long- to round headed populations. It is not clear from our data whether we should differentiate an older bone carving culture on the lower Fraser from a more recent stone carving one. Carved stone and Vhalebone clubs have a wide distribution and show considerable differentiation, possibly attri butable to development from a simpler artistic prototype.37 Stone carvings, anthropomorphic in form, some of which are two and three feet high, are found in northern Puget Sound along the upper reaches of the Nooksack and Skagit rivers in the region of Reagan's old bone culture. His toric peoples of these localities have strong ties with Plateau groups to the east and the presence of carved stone in their territory might well sub stantiate a north Plateau source for the Dalles Deschutes carving. However, they are not among those historic Coast Salish who have a vital tra dition in wood carving and this fact lends some support to the idea that the stone carvings ob tained there belong to a truly prehistoric culture. No historic Coast Salish, of course, have ever 35 M. W. Smith, 1946. 36 Hill-Tout, 1932; Matier, 1936; Milligan, 1933, 1937; Robinson, 1935; H. B. Smith, 1933; and St. John, 1933, 1934. 87 Boas, 1904; H. I. Smith, 1908. been associated with stone carving or with elabo rate bone carving. At any rate, carving in either substance is in a tradition differing in many particulars from his toric wood carving in the Columbia-Fraser region. The few persons who have dealt at all with the Columbia-Fraser bone and stone carvings under discussion have tended to compare them with fully developed historic Northwest Coast art. Only the vaguest relationships have been dis cernible. It has, furthermore, been usual to regard Coast and Interior Salish wood sculptures of the Columbia-Fraser region as cruder variants of the more highly developed northern art (see Boas, quoted above). Although northern art had come in for considerable attention, Salish work had gone unnoticed until a recent, thorough analysis which demonstrates the high quality of local sculpture and painting styles and, more impor tantly for our purposes, their relative unique ness.38 Whatever the roots of Salish art may be, it no longer seems tenable to regard it as a cruder variant of Northwest Coast art. Indeed, it seems quite possible that the spectacular fluorescence of Kwakiutl art developed, under stimulus from the northern coast, on an artistic base closely related to historic Salish. The rich, but much neglected, prehistoric carv ing of the Columbia-Fraser region seems to be a purely local development. No materials lead to important finds of a similar nature outside the region. It may be tentatively considered older and more elaborated in the northern part of the region, especially along the middle and lower Fraser River. And, although strong artistic im pulses entered the region from outside, most theories to date seem to err on the side of under rating the vigor of a local cultural strain.39 2 and 3. In relation to the last two of the factors which emerge from our survey, it is not always easy to demonstrate that archaeological sites in this region which now yield few bone objects were not once rich in bone that has since deteriorated through weathering, salt water action, etc. Yet bone often has great durability in moist soils, and sites occur from San Francisco Bay to the Fraser which yield quantities of bone and little stone. Some of these, also, are demon strably old and, as at Wakemap, stratigraphically 38Wingert, 1949a, 19496. For further corroboration of the same point see Herzog, 1949. 39Codere (1948) has already demonstrated the vitality of a Middle Fraser tradition, although in quite different materials.

It seems mandatory to note these varying proportions of bone and stone in any systematic site summary. In addition, concentrations of chipped stone have so frequently been said to point toward an eastern, or interior, provenience that differences between preponderantly bone and stone sites may bear upon subtle variations be tween river and marine adaptations. This is a matter to which we will return in the final chapter. In the trait and site summaries which follow, it has been found meaningful to incorporate historic ethnological materials wherever they were avail able. Since they are fuller for southern and central Puget Sound than for other parts of our region, the historic data are weighted toward the south. Because of the constant economic similarities cul tural remains may not be expected to differ radi cally in major items. No great inventions, such as pottery, come in to ornament our picture. Yet four phases of culture may be distinguished. These have been briefly characterized in the trait lists given in Table 3 and are more fully described below. LATE BONE CULTURE In the salt water areas of the Columbia-Fraser region existed a predominantly bone culture which tied with historically known peoples. Wickersham spoke of a living culture weak in stone implements and, since he knew most inti mately the Indians of the southern Sound, it seems reasonable to apply his description to that locality at least. Recent ethnological work in the southern Sound confirms this assumption.40 The central Sound also specialized in bone: H. I. Smith found bone and antler at Stanwood at the mouth of the Stillaguamish, at New Dungeness and Port Williams,41 and bone is reported for historic Snohomish.42 Gibbs does not mention points of stone for historic western Washington.43 Although bone points are mentioned for the Lummi44 and Clallam,45 the relative amounts of stone and bone used for their artifacts are not clear. The Quinault, on the west coast of the Olympic Peninsula, used bone rather than stone points,46 and the Lower Chinook at the mouth of 40 M. W. Smith, 19406, pp. 199, 266, 295-6, 321-3. 11 H. I. Smith, 1904a. 42 Haeberlin and Gunther, 1930, pp. 26-8. 43 Gibbs, 1877, pp. 175, 192, 214. 44 Stern, 1934, p. 49. ,3 Gunther, 1927, p. 204. 4,i Olson, 1936, pp. 75-6, 78. the Columbia River used little stone.47 To the south, the Bullard site on the lower Coquille River, Oregon, yielded a cultural complex rich in bone and antler artifacts but with limited stone work and stone projectile points absent. This relatively shallow habitation site ties with his toric Lower Coquille and is ascribed by Leather man and Krieger to the middle of the nineteenth century.48 To the north, Reagan found deep deposits at Quilliute which led him to infer that the pre dominantly bone culture, which tied with living Quilliute, was of considerable age. At Queets he located a shell heap which was "abandoned at least five hundred years ago"49 but says nothing of its artifact types. Farther north, on the Olympic Peninsula, Reagan describes a culture similar to the Quilliute as prehistoric, underlying an historic Ozette and Makah stone culture. Still farther north, on the Strait of Georgia, Harlan I. Smith described bone artifacts in great numbers, occurring at Comox with only six polished stone points, a single stone celt, and one chipped point.50 He felt bone to be characteristic of the Strait from Comox as far south as Victoria, al though Saanitch yielded some stone, both polished and chipped. Reagan lists the following traits for Quilliute and Hoh deposits: barbed and grooved bone points, bone skinning knives and scrapers, whale rib daggers, bone needles, and mussel shell knives.51 He also says that historic Quilliute made arrow points of the "rough paleolithic type" from beach agates, but in "no great num bers."52 He further attributes the presence (sur face?) of "implements of jade-like rock and basaltic glass or thin slate" to an attack by north ern tribes. Accounts of historic southern Puget Sound and of the other historic peoples previ ously mentioned cite the bone artifacts of Rea gan's list, sometimes giving bone daggers or knives instead of ones of whale rib; indicate a tendency toward tools of shell, teeth, and hard or hardened wood; and add to the list antler wedges, gaming bones and beaver teeth, bone or shell beads, sandstone smoothers, occasional chipped stone arrow or spear points, chisel or adz blades of ground stone as well as bone, ground 47 Ray, 1938, p. 135. 48 Leatherman and Krieger, 1940, p. 21. 4S&gt; Reagan, 1928, p. 297.

The Bullard site yielded bone artifacts as in Reagan's list, but without needles; showed greater emphasis upon antler than one would expect from the traits cited above; added chipped scrapers and choppers roughly chipped from waterworn pebbles; and carried the traits listed for historic peoples with the exception of gaming bones and teeth, clubs, chipped points, and ground stone blades, mauls, and pestles. Stone adz blades appear as surface finds along beaches in the general neighborhood,53 Carving, in either bone or stone, is generally lacking in the Late Bone culture, although Harlan I. Smith reported three decorated objects from Comox. Bone incising, which is infrequent, consists of parallel and crossed lines and dot and circle designs. EARLY BONE CULTURE This culture is apparently of great age and covered the region of the lower Fraser, Port Hammond and below, and the area just south, including Boundary Bay and Point Roberts. Burial mounds which occur in the area of the lower Fraser and Point Roberts, as far inland as Sumas Lake, and on Vancouver Island may be related. Skeletal material is found within some of the Fraser middens.54 Reagan gives no trait lists for this old culture except to mention "large numbers of barbed and grooved bone spear and arrow points and other bone implements and but few of stone." Bone predominates over stone in the Fraser middens.55 The Marpole site yielded many barbed and grooved bone points, bone needles, bone adz blades or chisels, and other bone pieces; some chipped stone points; ground jadeite adz blades, mauls and pestles, and at least one stone club.56 The wealth of the culture lay mainly in the expert workmanship which, interestingly enough, was most marked in artifacts from the lower strata.57 An unusual find was that of a body en cased in sheets of beaten copper with a copper band on the head.58 There was also evidence that 53 Leatherman and Krieger, 1940. 51 Hill-Tout, 1895; Reagan, 1917, p. 29. 55 Hill-Tout, 1895, pp. 112-3. 5(5 Hill-Tout, 1932 and 1938; Hill-Tout and Kidder, 1932. 57 Menzies, 1938, p. 360. Also noted by H. I. Smith, 1904a, p. 434. 58 Menzies, 1938, p. 360. later round heads had displaced an early, long headed population with possible Eskimoid characteristics59 and showing certain Asiatic facial features.60 Corroboration or refutation of these factors are long overdue. H. I. Smith noted no "apparent differences" at Port Hammond between recent and older layers; yet he mentions "exquisite specimens of stone and bone carving" and points of chipped and ground stone; and his data corroborate the existence of two types of skeleton.61 The difference between this culture and the Late Bone culture already described certainly does not appear in trait lists as given here. It rests rather in (1) its greater age, as attested by the depth of deposit, preservation of fill, and growth of forest above, and by the fact that the sites are described as being inland from the pres ent shore line and as marking the old coast.62 As mentioned above, Reagan dates the culture as being between 1500 and 2000 years old63 and Hill-Tout places the early deposits at Marpole "at least two thousand years ago."64 The differ ence rests also in (2) the presence of frequent, and often elaborate, decoration?intricate incis ing on bone implements; small carvings; and carved mortars, pestles, and bowls?and (3) the use of copper in connection with disposal rites. Something of a problem is raised by the fact that Reagan does not mention carving for his old, bone sites but, since he specifically notes the absence of "effigies and totems" in the Ozette Makah-Clallam bone strata and ties these to the Quilliute rather than to the old Fraser River finds, its presence can be inferred. This cultural phase seems to merge with the historic phase previously described, but the im portance of the carved objects seems so great that only a demonstrated stylistic tie between the early bone and stone carving and historic wood carving would satisfactorily link them. Four feet below the surface of the Marpole mound a carved anthropomorphic head 11 inches high and weigh ing 40 pounds was found.65 Massive stone carv ings have turned up again and again on the lower Fraser. They are also reported for the area to the 59 Robinson, 1935. 60 Hill-Tout, 1932 and 1938. 01 H. I.

The largest of these was certainly three feet high. Similar carved stone figures appear likewise in the region of the lower and middle Columbia River.66 The carvings are often found in deep forest, partially or almost entirely covered by natural accumulations. Strati graphic data are not yet available for the Mar pole site and nothing is known of the cultural as sociations of the other figures. They are certainly not isolated cultural freaks and, although only fragmentary accounts of them have been written, they represent the most impressive stone work in the northern New World. EASTERN STONE CULTURE This cultural phase lies slightly beyond the region of our inquiry as that region was originally defined. It covers the upper Fraser and Columbia rivers and the Thompson River. Thus, it extends along the eastern slope of the Cascades from well north of the northern Sound to about Ellensberg. How far inland it goes is unknown and its age is likewise obscure. The history of our region is inti mately tied to this section and consideration of it is inescapable. The culture is characterized by a variety of stone work with numerous chipped points (see Table 2). Chipped stone knives, drills, and scrapers are also common. Ground stone objects include mortars, pestles, adzes, grooved club heads and mauls, mauls, tubular pipes, arrow smoothers, and whetstones. Gambling bones and teeth, and shell ornaments occur; as do antler wedges, barbed points, and handles; and bone needles, awls, barbed points, scrapers, and adzes.67 The Shuswap seem to be beyond the fully developed aspects of this cultural phase be cause Smith reports they neither "made or used" stone mortars.68 It is quite possible that the full vigor of Eastern Stone seen on the upper Fraser as described here peters out to the north, east, and south so that these become marginal to an elaborate core. If this is so, I tend to see the point of highest development of Eastern Stone in the more western parts of its distribution, in other words, in the area of the middle Fraser. It is extremely interesting that both Harlan I. B6 See also discussion of carving above. CT H. I. Smith, 1906a, 1908, etc. 08 H. I. Smith, 1908, p. 776. Smith and the workers in the Dalles-Deschutes region felt that influences had proceeded from the area of the Eastern Stone culture to the coast, Smith seeing significant traits which had passed eastward as well as westward along the Fraser, and Strong, Schenck, and Steward noting a south ward trend via the Columbia. In the light of these influences and the vigor of the materials them selves, one supposes a culture of some vitality and, presumably, of some age. Certainly islands of specialization had developed within it. There is no doubt that it has been of extreme importance to events in the Pacific Northwest. It is probably fully represented in the McClallam Middle Fraser Collection and has at least two develop ments of importance in the Columbia-Fraser region: the Juan de Fuca and Deschutes-Willam ette. These may be called coastal or western phases of the Eastern Stone culture. JUAN DE FUCA PHASE Reagan is again our authority for a predomi nantly stone culture underlying and similar to that of strata bearing objects of white manu facture and overlying materials classified here as "Late Bone." He places this culture on the tip of the Olympic Peninsula in historic Ozette Makah territory and eastward along the coast of the Peninsula into historic Clallam country. Its least extent, therefore, was along the southern shore of Juan de Fuca Strait and it merged into the period of white contact. The distinctive feature of this culture lies not only in its predominant use of stone but in the frequent occurrence of carving. Reagan indicates that remains of the Ozette-Makah region were similar to what he calls "recent" artifacts but the strata lacked white goods and contained more Pacific oyster shells. "These remains, as with the recent, contain many stone implements, such as hammers, chisels, knives, daggers, etc. They also contain stone effigies, totems, and other house hold ornaments and curios, all distinctly Makah in make."69 The exact relations of these carvings to those of historic wood sculptures on the one hand and to the massive stone sculptures of the mainland on the other, form one of the major problems to be deciphered by future archaeologi cal work. Many of the clues to historic ties and developments may lie in materials from this cul ture. And if the center of Eastern Stone later proves to be in the middle and somewhat lower 69 Reagan, 1917, p. 18.</page><page sequence="36">32 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 6 Fraser, Juan de Fuca may have more direct roots in the area just north of its present distri bution than now appears. DESCHUTES-WILLAMETTE PHASE Like the Juan de Fuca, this is characterized by the extreme use of stone and by the presence of carving. It likewise existed up to the period of white contact but, unlike the Juan de Fuca, there is no evidence that it survived this contact, or ties with the historic peoples of the area. It occurs on the Columbia River at the mouth of the Deschutes, on the north bank of the Columbia at the Dalles, and along the Willamette from its confluence with the Columbia. Its known area, therefore, and this is again like the Juan de Fuca, is relatively limited. It should be added here that the existence of this cultural phase as distinct from the Coastal Stone to be described below depends largely upon my analysis of the data from the area, and the traits which distinguish the two would have sug gested much less significant differences if Strong, Schenck, and Steward had not tied the rich finds of the cremation pits in the Dalles-Deschutes region with the upper strata of Wakemap. The same authors felt that cremation and burial as means of disposal of the dead coexisted in their area and both methods appear in the culture as I have outlined it. The Deschutes-Willamette shows a generally rich culture. Artifacts are numerous, with stone predominant. Shell is infrequent, occurring mainly as beads. Ground stone is relatively com mon, although ground points and adz blades or chisels are absent, the most significant articles being mortars (or dishes or lamps), tubular pipes, and girdled sinkers. Bone points are scarce or absent. Antler and bone is characteristically decorated, and carving of a distinct, semi-realistic style appears on clubs and on small pieces which are apparently non-utilitarian. The proportion of bone and stone varies from site to site, and the amount of decoration and carving differs mark edly, perhaps depending, as Strong, Schenck, and Steward have suggested, upon the amount of ceremonial material present. The richest of these presumably ceremonial materials come from the cremation pits: few artifacts are associated with burials and they are not of the rich "cere monial" type. Wakemap mound shows the culture in the stratum above 1.65 m. Mauls, sinkers, pipes, and sculpturing occur for the first time and ground depression mortars70 also make their appearance. The Miller Island cremation pits, which agree most closely with the 0.75 to 1.2 m. level of Wakemap, show the culture in its richest phase but without many of the features of the Wake map habitation site. A shell deposit on Sauvie's Wappatoo Island at the confluence of the Willa mette and the Columbia rivers,71 showed con siderable bone, including suggestions of carved clubs, but no shell or horn; chipped and ground stone, with girdled sinkers and hammerstones, and elaborate carving occurred from the surface to 1.7 m. It is notable that, although Wakemap yielded no bird bones, Sauvie's Island had bird bones throughout. Mounds in the Willamette drainage show burials with occasional artifacts and human debris in parts at least of the mound earth. The Tangent site72 yielded shell beads as deep as 1.2 m., little bone, pestles with ornamented ends, and bowl-like mortars. Mortars were associated with burials in the Fanning mound; chipped points were abundant; some bone and antler and a barbed harpoon point were present; and there were sinkers, a tubular pipe, and a carved bone head identical in style to those of the Dalles-Deschutes region. The Fuller mound yielded beads and whalebone as sociated with burials, chipped stone, pestles, sinkers, mortars, and decorated antler and bird bones. Spurland, Halsey, and Shedd mounds con tained bone, antler, chipped stone, and pestles and mortars; the mortars in Shedd showed in cised decoration and Spurland mound had beads, mauls, and four chipped tools of petrified wood. All of the Willamette mounds, including Sauvie's Island at the river's mouth, show considerable obsidian.73 COASTAL STONE CULTURE The ties between this and the Eastern Stone culture mentioned above are obscure. As with that culture, there are indications that the geo graphical area covered was extensive, in this case following the coastal region west of the Cascade Range, probably at least from the lower Fraser to central Oregon. Data north of the Fraser are lacking. There is some reason for giving the cul ture a relatively long time span, for believing that 70 Strong, Schenck, and Steward, 1930, p. 99. 71 Ibid., p. 147. 72 Ibid. 7:f Laughlin, 1941; 1942.</page><page sequence="37">smith! ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 33 in some places it merged into the Late Bone as described above, and that in others, it existed side by side with Late Bone, each culture main taining itself as relatively distinct. The culture is shown in its simplest form in Wakemap mound below the 2.7 m. level, i.e., from 2.75 to 5.05 m. The archaeological remains are neither exceptionally rich nor abundant: bone awls or adz blades, needles, and occasional points; antler pieces, especially wedges; ground stone pestles; and various chipped scrapers, knives, and points. Figure 2, 22, may be a diag nostic point for some phases of Coastal Stone. The relative frequency of the materials can be seen by the fact that Pit L, Wakemap, yielded in this stratum 17 bone, 11 antler, 10 ground stone, and 64 chipped stone pieces. Miller mound on the upper Willamette River,74 dated at least 350 years ago on the evidence of forest growth above it, has yielded skeletal material and chipped stone and the associated camp site showed chipped stone and a pestle. Further de scription is lacking but the Miller site may be tentatively correlated with the lower level of Wakemap. The Schwenn site75 on the Coquille River, four or more miles inland from the Bullard site, which has been assigned with some reservations to the Late Bone culture, gave the same trait list as lower Wakemap and Miller plus two fragments of stone mortars and a fragment of a tubular pipe. This site is described as probably prehis toric by Leatherman and Krieger and may indi cate that Coastal Stone endured here late enough to receive influences from the Deschutes-Wil lamette. Recent ethnologic investigations on the Oregon coast76 from the Tolowa to the Tillamook also show a predominantly stone culture, bone and horn points being mentioned only for Sixes River. Although elbow pipes are given for the Siuslaw, Alsea, and Tillamook, these may well have been influenced by white contact. Tubular pipes were denied by all informants from this coastal strip77 but steatite mortars or bowls are mentioned for Tolowa, Galice Creek, Sixes River, and Siuslaw. This may be further evidence of Coastal Stone receiving Interior Stone traits and, if so, car ries the combined complex into the historic level. 74Laughlin, 1941, pp. 151-2. 75 Leatherman and Krieger, 1940, pp. 27-8. 7,!Barnett, 193-7. 77 Ibid., p. 194. Mauls are absent from the sites already de scribed,78 but Coastal Stone sites north of the Columbia River include both mauls and adz blades. The Bertelson Suquamish Collection seems to indicate such a site at Suquamish with little bone and antler, much chipped stone, pestles, mauls, and adz blades. Needles, which are suggested for the Schwenn site, are absent in the Bertelson Collection but since they would necessarily be fragile this is not definitive. Eburne mound on the lower Fraser may be included in the Coastal Stone culture and Thacker79 found many stone pieces on the San Juan Islands which Harlan I. Smith thought resembled "in shape and material those found at Port Hammond and Eburne."80 Eburne is given considerable age and one may even hazard the guess that the old stone culture mentioned by Reagan for the north ern coast of the Olympic Peninsula should be similarly allocated. The Cattle Point site in the San Juan Islands seems from preliminary reports to show simple Coastal Stone becoming more complex toward the upper levels.81 Again it seems to be an absence of carving which most aptly differentiates these levels from Juan de Fuca. James Island82 in historic Quilliute country on the west coast of the Olympic Peninsula yielded chipped points and a stone adz blade plus "a stone pipe." Because of local tradition and the great number of human bones present, Reagan thought this cave site was a disposal ground for the bodies and artifacts of enemies slain by historic Quilliute. Some incredulity naturally attaches to such an explanation especially in view of the extent of the remains and the rich artifact count. The pipe, the form of which is not given, may indicate, as in the case of Schwenn, 78 At least tentatively I am classifying the " pear-shaped maul'' cited for historic Tolowa by Barnett as a pestle. The whole distinction between mauls and pestles is mainly functional and highly inaccurate. However, the mauls are taken here as being consistently large, heavy, worked stones suitable for advanced woodwork; pestles are lighter and used frequently for food stuffs. The dis tinction holds ethnologically. Unworked hammerstones replace mauls in some Coastal Stone south of the Co lumbia but information on these unspectacular specimens does not warrant their inclusion in trait lists at the pres ent. 79 In H.

There is no doubt that pipes were exchanged from east of the Cascades to the Sound in rela tively late times.83 TRAIT SUMMARY Within the Columbia-Fraser region where so many of the material culture traits have appar ently remained stable for a very long period of time, any distinctions between archaeological cultures will have, necessarily, to depend upon refined procedures of analysis and, possibly, upon the presence or absence of a few traits. The four cultures or phases of culture which have been described above bear many resemblances to each other. However, if our survey has led to classifications which may later prove meaningful, they have also included a few key traits which may prove of diagnostic value. The first of these is, of course, the presence of stone and bone decoration and carving discussed at length above. This occurs only in the Early Bone culture, in Eastern Stone, and particularly in the coastal phases of the latter. The relatively recent Juan de Fuca coastal phase of Eastern Stone seems to lack stone sculpture but is rich in bone, and presumably, wood carving. The Co lumbia Valley art style is attributed to what we have called the Deschutes-Willamette coastal phase of Eastern Stone and the center of this apparently old impetus toward carving seems to be the Fraser River. There seems little doubt that in archaeological times the Fraser exceeded the Columbia in the richness and variety of its cultures. Copper is likewise attributed to Early Bone and may also occur in northern Coastal Stone. The techniques for working copper faded out in the historic cultures of the Columbia-Fraser region except possibly on the northern shores of the Olympic Peninsula and, if its presence in Coastal Stone is later substantiated, it may w7ell indicate some antiquity for that culture. Copper 83 Wickersham, 1900, p. 146: ". . . in Washington they [pipes] are quite plain, though highly polished. Few are found along the coast or on Puget Sound; many more are found on the midland prairie. . . ." According to Sam Wilson, the Suquamish of the historic period used a pipe "of black polished rock which they got from the Yakimas." After the coming of the whites, the Snohomish (?) "obtained black stone pipes from the Klikitat" (Haeberlin and Gunther, 1930, p. 66). occurs prehistorically on the Strait of Georgia and is well known ethnologically for the northern Northwest Coast. Ground stone clubs are lacking in Deschutes Willamette and in Coastal Stone. Since ground stone articles occur in more variety north of the Fraser than south of it, this may only be a re flection of the fact that our known Coastal Stone sites now occur in the more southern portions of our region. If it later proves that the asymmetric triangular point previously discussed be truly diagnostic of Coastal Stone, then sites at least as far north as the Fraser may be expected, and their associations with ground stone will prove revealing. Ground stone points are known in the Columbia-Fraser region only in Juan de Fuca, though whether their presence there is dependent upon northern connections or upon early Fraser River cultures now classed as Eastern Stone remains unresolved. Considerable point has been made both here and in other descriptions of the fact that the ap parent absence of stone mortars in very late prehistoric sites need only indicate that they were too valuable to be lost in cultural debris. This explanation is becoming less convincing. Stone mortars of a simple type appear in our region only in the Juan de Fuca and Deschutes Willamette phases of Eastern Stone. Carved stone dishes may be associated with Early Bone and simple stone mortars or lamps occur along the coast from the far north to southern California. I am inclined, however, to attribute the pres ence of simple, ground depression stone mortars in the late phases of Eastern Stone to a recent northward wave of influence coming up along the eastern foothills from California. It will be remembered that the Shuswap in the extreme northern Plateau are not reported to have had stone mortars. Final clarification of this point will have to wait upon careful work upon Eastern Stone and especially upon its affiliations with Early Bone. The question in regard to mauls and pestles may be of equal interest. They are lacking only in prehistoric Late Bone. Mauls certainly have a northern distribution and pestles may have south ern ties. But conclusions on present data are im possible. Ground stone adz blades are typically present in our region and their absence in Deschutes Willamette is, therefore, especially to be noted. These blades also tie with cultural aspects to the north and, on the evidence of the material</page><page sequence="39">smith] ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 35 from which they are made, are even sometimes judged to have been trade articles into "some parts of our region. Sinkers and pipes are present only in the Deschutes-Willamette phase of Eastern Stone, and pipes may well be taken as a sign of contact with that culture. The age of pipes in Eastern Stone is not known but they are almost certainly recent anywhere west of the mountains. Sinkers are typically absent from our region and this is noteworthy for an economy adapted to river and marine life. If we take our clues from ethnology, we may lay this absence to a real lack in the culture and not just to archaeological accident. Historically, nets and lines were only sunk shal lowly either in shallow water or at the surface of deep water and the process used was to tie the corner or side to be submerged to the end of a long pole which was then inserted in the water. This allowed better control of the net than could any system of weights not controllable from above the water, and made sinkers un necessary. A trait which needs careful checking is the apparent presence of shell knives only in Late Bone. If proven correct, this might be of great diagnostic value. Eyed bone needles are present in Early and Late Bone and in the Juan de Fuca phase of East ern Stone, and in some phases of Coastal Stone. The presence in McClallum Middle Fraser of bone needles which had grooves for the sewing fiber instead of eyes, and were triangular in cross section as are historic wooden mat needles, may furnish an important chapter in the history of Columbia-Fraser needles. Eyed needles are certainly old along the Fraser and their distribu tion may turn out to be highly significant. Chipped stone is more characteristic of some of our cultures than of others but it is truly scarce only in Late Bone and Juan de Fuca. Yet a curious situation in regard to archaeological generalizations has arisen on the Northwest Coast. We have seen that ground stone artifacts occur in the northern Northwest Coast, with chipping hardly appearing at all north of Comox on the Strait of Georgia, and that chipped stone appears in quantity along the Fraser. This dis tribution, coupled with the results achieved by Wickersham and Harlan Smith in the impover ished shell heaps south of the Fraser, led Smith to conclude, as we have seen above, that the art of stone chipping and other Eastern Stone traits had come via the Fraser with a late migration which "took place from the interior to the coast and to Vancouver Island." Descriptions of the Northwest Coast have often centered upon the spectacular cultural developments north of the Fraser delta in the area of ground stone and have pointed to a lack of stone chipping. Thus, in the Northwest Coast handbook, Goddard says: "Curiously enough, no stone tools were made by flaking."84 And Kroeber, in his excellent resume of Northwest Coast traits, elaborates the point: "The one early art which has become lost is that of stone chipping. It is likely that grind ing replaced this under the influence of control ling processes of wood working. . . ,"85 Such statements have often been taken to refer to the entire Northwest Coast and even persons familiar with chipped points from the Columbia Valley have assumed these to be as recent as the Fraser chipped artifacts were thought to be by Smith. A generalization to the effect that "the North west Coast had no stone chipping" has come to be widely accepted. It should be made perfectly clear at this time that the generalization about the absence of chipped stone artifacts is archaeologically quite false for the Columbia-Fraser region of the Northwest Coast, and that it refers only to cer tain ethnological materials which tie in with wThat has been here identified as the Late Bone cul ture, and less strikingly with the Juan de Fuca phase of Eastern Stone culture. The extreme de velopment of wood and bone work may well have led as Kroeber suggests to an exaggeration of grinding techniques at the expense of chip ping in the area of northern, classic Northwest Coast. But it is also clear that cultures rich in bone (and presumably wood) existed on the archaeological level as well as on the historic level in southern Northwest Coast, that these did not progress to elaborate complexes of ground stone articles to the exclusion of chipping, and that the highest development on the Fraser used both grinding and chipping in roughly equal pro portion and at an early period. Chipped stone is typically present on the archaeological levels of the southern Northwest Coast. 84 Goddard, 1945, p. 36. 85Kroeber, 1923, p. 8.</page><page sequence="40">THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION AND THE NORTHWEST COAST THE archaeology of the Columbia-Fraser region in the southern Northwest Coast is more complicated than early generalizations would have led one to suspect. Although there has been a constant adaptation to a river and marine economy, variations within that economy are marked and may be tentatively identified by the presence of bone and stone carving, and by the proportion of stone to bone tools. Using these criteria, four cultural phases may be recognized: (1) Late Bone, which ties with historically known Indian groups and occurs throughout the region. It has wood sculpture but no carving in bone or stone; there are a few ground stone artifacts but chipped stone is rare. (2) Early Bone, which has the greatest antiquity and is apparently the richest culture of the region, having elaborate carving in bone and stone, beaten copper, a large variety of bone artifacts, and a number of stone pieces both ground and chipped. It is limited to the immediate neighborhood of the Fraser delta and is not represented in historic cultures. (3) Eastern Stone, which has two coastal phases in the Columbia-Fraser region, the Juan de Fuca and Deschutes-Willamette. The former merges with historic cultures, and over lies Late Bone on the northern shore of the Olympic Peninsula; and the latter comes up to the period of white contact but is not known historically. Both of these are limited in dis tribution and have carvings in bone and stone. (4) Coastal Stone, which has considerable depth of deposit, shows various periods of develop ment, and occurs throughout the region. It is marked by numerous chipped artifacts and ab sence of carved bone or stone. It persisted into historic times at least on the Oregon coast and its ties go as far south as central California. Chipped stone is typically present in Co lumbia-Fraser sites, being really rare only in Late Bone, but it hardly appears north of Comox on the Gulf of Georgia. Ground points and knives occur on the Fraser and in Juan de Fuca but not south of there. They are, however, the distinguishing archaeological feature of the north ern Northwest Coast and the two regions con trast sharply on this score. The northern region also shows rich work in bone and horn. His torically, it is famous for the spectacular de velopment of an artistic wood-working tradition. Boxes, masks, house posts, and totem poles are familiar to even casual observers of classic North west Coast. Both Early Bone and the coastal phases of Eastern Stone have a striking tradi tion of bone and of large stone monolith art, but neither of these art traditions tie closely with the wood styles of the northern coast. It is also worthy of particular attention that recent work in Salish wood sculpture and painting (his toric phase of Late Bone) distinguishes Salish art from that of classic Northwest Coast. Traits of material culture, such as the roller loom and basketry, also differentiate the northern and southern regions of Northwest Coast on the historic level. Yet there has been a tendency on the part of many anthropologists to view the wood-working and wealth-conscious cultures of the Pacific Coast in terms of a simple continuum beginning with the high development in the northern North west Coast and gradually petering out toward the south. According to this view, not only the Columbia-Fraser region but the cultures of northern and even central California may be viewed from the vantage point of developed Northwest Coast. A second, and more recent, tendency has been to think of the high northern development as relatively recent, taking place, possibly under a far northern or Asiatic influence, within an old cultural layer which extended well along the coast line and included the Plateau. According to such a view, the highly specialized Kwakiutl, whose culture has long been recog nized as containing elements from cultures both north and south of them, are seen as a recent development due in part to a northerly derived stimulus reaching a well entrenched local de velopment of the old layer. The possibility that considerable change took place in the material culture of the northern Northwest Coast after initial white contacts, and with the increased wealth brought about by early trade, is also fre quently cited. In either case, the north takes precedence as the source of cultural emphasis 36</page><page sequence="41">smith! ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 37 and this outlook is underlined by the fact that many of the artifact types are Eskimoid in char acter. On the basis of horizontal distributions, Drucker distinguishes three aspects within "the Northwest Coast pattern":1 a Northern aspect in Tlingit-Haida-Tsimshian territories, a Mil banke-Queen Charlotte Sound aspect coextensive with the Kwakiutl territory of historic times, and a Straits of Georgia-Puget Sound aspect. He further speaks of the "culture of the Fraser Columbia basins,"2 which he follows Harlan I. Smith and others in regarding as intrusive on the coast from the interior, and possibly "a specialized or modified aspect of a Plateau, or, perhaps better, Fraser-Columbia River phase."3 His third aspect and his intrusive interior cul ture are both included in the data on our Co lumbia-Fraser region. Strong, Schenck, and Stew ard had previously advanced the suggestion that "in Coast Salish territory we may yet distin guish the early manifestations of the widespread northwest coast culture."4 This has often been considered feasible by Coast Salish specialists and Drucker finds nothing impossible in it ex cept that he would like to replace Coast Salish with "simply 'Salish'" thus shifting the em phasis somewhat farther inland. It should also be noted that all three of Drucker's aspects draw heavily upon interior traits, so that the whole question of east-west influences retains its sig nificance. Any historical sketch of Northwest Coast must clearly deal with two sets of distributions: one of which leads north and south and the other east and west. The Columbia-Fraser region writh its excellent salt water routes is almost encircled by the two great rivers from which it derives its name. This dominating river system formed an excellent passage for east-west traits and its posi tion midway on the Pacific Coast put it in the direct path of north-south influences. The archaeological evidence reviewed here is, admit tedly, not of the best. But lacking other informa tion, it still seems possible to add something to our knowledge of movements in these directions. If I treat the data with more assurance than they warrant, I can only refer the cautious reader to the more detailed and problematical sections of 1 Drucker, 1943, p. 123. 2 Ibid., p. 127-8. 3 Ibid. 4 Strong, Schenck, and Steward, 1930, p. 145. this paper. The following paragraphs contain a framework of history, and as such they are blocked in with bold strokes. The earliest cultural focus of the Columbia Fraser region has been variously dated from 1500 to 2000 years ago. This early focus seems to have represented a rich culture on the Fraser River. No parallels to it have yet been discovered on the Pacific Coast south of Alaska, and the total adaptation of the culture, as well as such particular items as eyed needles, also point to the far north. Whatever these connections may once have been, they seem by the time of Early Bone to have been overshadowed by purely local de velopments. More detailed information is badly needed on Early Bone, yet the remains seem to have been so local, so limited to a relatively concentrated population, that the greatest care must be taken in the future not to destroy the record by inexpert test pitting and excavating. It is tempting to view Early Bone as parent to both Eastern Stone and to Late Bone. Certainly the drainage of the Fraser River and the salt waters adjoining its delta formed a cultural nucleus of a major sort. But it must also be borne in mind that Late Bone and Juan de Fuca carry traits which tie with the more northern aspects of Northwest Coast. During the time covered by our data, there seems no indication of strong influence direct from the north until the late period. This northern influence can be variously traced in ethnological materials and may be most immediately shown archaeologically by the limited southward movement of ground stone points. Southward movement of classic Northwest Coast traits at this time may have followed the Straits of Georgia to the mouth of the Fraser and then upstream, carrying ground points among other things, and also traveled down through Lillooet country directly into the area of Eastern Stone. Eastern Stone may not have developed under such direct pressure from the north but it clearly received a powerful impetus which carried it down the Columbia to the middle Columbia (Deschutes-Willamette) and down the Fraser, via the south side of the Fraser delta out to the islands and the Olympic Peninsula where Juan de Fuca overlays Late Bone. The story of major northern influences, then, leaves the long period between the base traits of Early Bone and the protohistoric level un accounted for. This was apparently the period of major local development. It seems also to have</page><page sequence="42">38 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 6 been the period of Coastal Stone. Coastal Stone survived longest just south of our region, in Oregon, and from our knowledge to date it seems not to have penetrated far beyond the Fraser delta. Its distribution points to the south, yet the depth of deposit in the San Juan Islands suggests that it was early in the northern part of its area. There can hardly be any doubt that a chipped stone tradition, already well repre sented in Early Bone, ties the Columbia-Fraser region with the south and east. Chipped stone artifacts may well be extremely old along the Pacific Coast and the earliest levels of Coastal Stone may have a wider distribution than the fully developed phase as we have described it here. These levels may conceivably go back into the period of pre-Early Bone relationships with the far north. The presence of needles in some Coastal Stone sites may be indicative of such relationships. However this may be, Coastal Stone seems to be old and its main ties follow north and south along the coast. East-west distributions are marked along the entire Pacific coast and they are particularly sig nificant in our region in the valleys of the two great river systems. Yet it is easy to overempha size the routes of the Columbia and the Fraser. There is every reason to believe that there was constant exchange along all of the streams. This can be demonstrated ad nauseam on the historic level, and it will be remembered that Drucker mentions it for each of his Northwest Coast aspects and that the main cultural emphasis on the Fraser was seen by Harlan Smith as due to a migration from the east. The relations between Coastal Stone and Eastern Stone, both of which relied upon chipped tools, thus assumes con siderable importance. Eastern Stone may be viewed in two ways. In the first place, a relatively simple culture following the intermontane Plateau may have developed in the northern part of its distribution into full-blown Eastern Stone under influences into the Fraser Valley which have al ready been indicated. If this view were to be accepted, early Eastern Stone would form an interior aspect paralleling Coastal Stone and its affiliations might be looked for equally far south. Cressman finds different complexes in central Oregon, however, and Great Basin archaeological materials cannot be identified with Plateau. On the historic and protohistoric level, Ray5 sees the Plateau divided into longitudinal sub-areas ac 5 Ray, 1939. cording to the borrowing of Coastal and Plains traits, and also into lateral areas which cannot be so easily interpreted as the result of extra areal influence. These lateral sub-areas are three in number: a northern one composed of Atha pascan peoples who are in a region beyond the area of our investigation and who contribute little that is distinctive to the Plateau; a second which he calls the Canadian or northern Plateau and which covers the region of much of Harlan Smith's work in Eastern Stone; and a third known as the American or southern Plateau which stops short of the territory of Deschutes Willamette and covers what according to this view of Eastern Stone would be its southern ex tent along the upper Columbia. The ties of this region to the Great Basin are discernible in the historic period but there are more differences than likenesses. Ray finds that the "north-south divi sion is the most definite and distinctive of any in the Plateau."6 In the face of this historic pic ture, and without proof on the archaeological level, I am loath to accept a simple continuum of early Eastern Stone throughout the Plateau. In the second place, and this is the opinion which seems to have been held most widely, Eastern Stone may be viewed as having de veloped pretty much in situ, its traits later pass ing along river and land routes both south and west. According to this view, Eastern Stone would not have paralleled Coastal Stone and the coastal tradition of chipped stone would remain relatively distinct from it at an early period. Harlan Smith drew no major distinctions between what we have called Eastern Stone and Early Bone. He found traits distributed down the Fraser and he was content to emphasize these east-west con tacts. If Eastern Stone developed locally, how ever, its relation to Early Bone must be ex plored. There is no indication that it has any where near the age of Early Bone, and since both have a strong tradition in carving, as well as other traits in common, Early Bone seems the parent culture. Ethnological discussions of the Northwest Coast often overlook the sometimes elaborate variation between truly coastal or mari time peoples and the groups living up the rivers or just above the river mouths. The distinction between salt water and river Indians is always important on the Northwest Coast and in the Columbia-Fraser region the distinctions are further elaborated into salt water, river, prairie, "Ibid., pp. 147-8.</page><page sequence="43">smithI ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 39 and inland groups. These differences follow topo graphical lines but they cannot be explained pure ly in terms of ecological conditions. It is plain that in the historic period the region has been populated by peoples of varying ways of life existing contemporaneously in localities only slightly separated from each other. The degree of local cultural autonomy is truly surprising. This picture seems borne out by our survey on the archaeological level and site descriptions give a strong impression of relatively stable, cul turally autonomous groups. This is particularly striking for Coastal Stone. In speaking of cul tural trends on the Northwest Coast, Kroeber expresses these facts in terms of "the unusual degree to which its material, native and im ported, has been worked over into its own pat terns."7 If the period of Early Bone showed equal diversity, and local autonomy, and there are indications that it did, its relation to Eastern Stone should not be seen simply as a stratum underlying later development. It seems more in keeping with the material to think of some vari ants of Early Bone developing into, or, better, continuing through, some aspects of Eastern Stone, all of this probably taking place in the drainage of the Fraser from the present site of Yale westward to the open sea. In so far as this interpretation of the data makes the general area of the lower Fraser drain age a main, if not the main, early cultural focus of the Northwest Coast, it has been fairly widely ac cepted. Kroeber gives seven areas for the Pacific Coast from the Tlingit to Northwestern Califor nia and sums up Northwest Coast chronology thus: "During the last half of the nineteenth century, the climax must be credited to the Northern Maritime tribes. . . . Previously, the climax was probably situated in the second or Wakashan group. . . . Still earlier, the climax may have lain in the third area, about the mouth of the Fraser and the opposite shore of Vancouver Island."8 By referring back to Kroeber's full de scription of his third area, de Laguna interprets him as seeing "the original center of Northwest Coast culture in the Gulf of Georgia and lower Fraser area of the Coast Salish"9 and tends to accept his scheme as similar to her own?to be given below. It should be pointed out, however, that Kroeber understands the early stage of 7 Kroeber, 1939, p. 28. 8 Ibid., p. 30. DeLaguna, 1947, p. 13. Northwest Coast culture in terms of "the recent hinterland cultures of the Columbia-Fraser (Pla teau) and of the Intermountain Athabascans."10 This would accord with the first rather than the second view of Eastern Stone presented here and would tend to disregard evidences of Coastal Stone. The data certainly tie the Plateau and Northwest Coast together. It is hardly possible to think of them at all as units separate from each other. Kroeber has added "that the North west culture as a whole originated on rivers and only slowly ventured on the open sea"11 and it is certainly tempting to regard the stone chip ping cultures as indicative of a riverine adapta tion opposed more or less to the maritime adapta tion of the bone cultures. If this is so, Coastal Stone furnishes an important chapter in the de velopment and we need no longer trust so entirely to the area east of the mountains for riverine springs to Northwest Coast culture. Approaching the Columbia-Fraser region from the Eskimoid materials of the north, de Laguna seems to assume maritime life in the earliest period. She hypothecates three stages on the southern Northwest Coast and places them more exactly in the Columbia-Fraser region than do other authors. She sees an ancient substratum of culture corresponding to Kachemak Bay I; an "intermediate" stage represented by the "Coast Salish sites excavated by H. I. Smith" and cor responding to Kachemak Bay II and to most of Kachemak Bay III, a.d. 500 to 1500; and a pro tohistoric period, beginning about a.d. 1500, or possibly a little later, and marked by the spread of Asiatic traits, "probably as a result of second ary diffusion from the northwest Coast, and also by a movement of Interior Salish tribes to the coast."12 Aside from the fact that ethnologists tend to be more conservative than archaeologists in identifying material culture remains with lan guage groups?and this part of de Laguna's scheme may well need revision?the data pre sented here fit her hypothetical sequence of events amazingly well. De Laguna, then, lists as roughly contempo raneous Kachemak Bay I, Birnirk, Old Bering Sea, and Ipiutak, and it is easy to think of Columbia-Fraser Early Bone as another in this series. Our date of 1500 to 2000 years ago for Early Bone agrees with de Laguna's date for all 10 Kroeber, 1939, p. 28. 11 Ibid., p. 30. 12 De Laguna, 1947, p. 12.</page><page sequence="44">40 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 6 of these as being before a.d. 500. Early Bone, however, represents a culture already specialized, and limited in area, and an "ancient substratum" must be thought of as preceding it. Our data, therefore, generally substantiate de Laguna's scheme for the southern Northwest Coast but call for some revisions in the direction of giving . a greater age to the Fraser climax and making it of greater significance to the general picture of Northwest development. It is noteworthy that this climax was apparently equally well adapted to a riverine and a truly marine existence. In brief, the Columbia-Fraser region seems to have witnessed an early climax of culture on the lower and middle Fraser corresponding both in time and in character to early climaxes of the far northern Pacific. This was preceded by the spread of a cultural layer in which far northern traits were already present. The Fraser remained the cultural focus of the region until well into the protohistoric period but the long years be tween saw an intensive development of locally autonomous cultures, both river and maritime. During this time, northern traits had less in fluence on cultural development than did traits from the south. The protohistoric period saw renewed northern influences coming into the re gion both along the coast and via river routes to the upper Fraser. The latter set up a strong outward pressure and both forces combined to accelerate development on the middle and lower Columbia River. But the northern nucleus re mained active, only moving westward and some what south ?to the Straits of Juan de Fuca. By this time, however, the true climax of Northwest Coast culture had shifted farther north and our whole southern region had assumed an almost peripheral character. The sequence of events presented here differs from preceding pictures of Northwest Coast de velopment on two main points: (1) it sees strong southern influences during the major period of Columbia-Fraser local development; and (2) it allows for determining Asiatic influences before a.d. 500 but then not again until the protohistoric period. It further relates events in the inter montane Plateau and in northwestern California to those of northern British Columbia. These re lationships had previously been apparent on the ethnological level but there were no schema for describing their operation. It need hardly be added that the character of the larger area thus defined still remains ethnologically unique in North America and that this uniqueness is vari ously reflected on the level of archaeological re search. After the work of the last decade, the North west Coast can no longer be viewed only as a simple north-south cultural continuum in which traits either attenuated southward or elaborated northward. Important as north-south contacts are in this area, both its archaeology and eth nology demand consideration of east-west rela tionships between the coast and the river and intermontane regions. Differences between a truly maritime and a river existence seem not only to distinguish the northern from the southern Northwest Coast on a historic and protohistoric level, but also to characterize archaeological hori zons. The remarkable vigor of Northwest Coast culture, and its exuberant manipulation of its environment, fed upon Arctic, Asiatic and, later, Western contacts. Yet there is every reason to believe that the development of this spectacular cultural growth on a basically simple food gathering economy was due in part to a local exchange between sustained differentiations. The history of mankind is replete with examples of groups which have absorbed or smothered others, and nowhere is this clearer than in the sharply distinct horizons of some stratigraphic sites. On the Northwest Coast, in contrast, sudden or strik ing shifts are hard to document in chronological sequence. Cultural change seems rather to have crystallized through contacts between enduring local autonomies. Many traits seem to have a peculiar individual existence of their own, either for a brief period in the cultural history or in a narrowly circumscribed region. Other traits have an unbroken continuity in space or time which is equally remarkable and, throughout, persist certain basic and sensitive adjustments to varied ecological conditions. In some parts of the world, reconstructions of history may rely upon the shifting fortunes of empires backed by clearly superior technological advances. But the historian of the Northwest Coast must work with more subtle processes. This area is one of the few left in the world which exhibits the processes of culture change taking place for an extended pe riod within a food-gathering economy and with a technology almost perfectly adapted to its de mands. To a great extent, modern economy in this region still rests upon fishing and wood working or lumbering. Such an historic situation is not easy to unravel but it proffers its chal lenge to the archaeologist and the ethnologist alike.</page><page sequence="45">BIBLIOGRAPHY The following abbreviations are used: AA American Anthropologist, N.S.
