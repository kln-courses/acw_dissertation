<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of Pongos and Men: Orangs-Outang in Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality Francis Moran III Rousseau's concept of human perfectibility and his suggestion that a group of anthropomorphic animals might actually be human beings in a primitive state of nature have led an increasing number of studies to cite his Discourse on Inequality for offering an early version of Darwinian evolution. I argue that a different picture emerges once we examine Rousseau's discussion against the backdrop of eighteenth-century debates on the viability of the chain of being and the possibility of multiple human species. The significance of his speculation has less to do with his special insights on human descent than with the political point to be made were it true. Rousseau uses orangs-outang like the pongo to construct a viable model for criticizing his contemporary Europe and to defend his claim that the kind of political inequalities associated with late European society do not issue from God or nature but are accidental events in the life of the species. The tenth note of Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men (1755) arrives at a pivotal point not only in the argument of this particular work, but also, insofar as it helps support his account of natural man, in the subsequent development of his political philosophy.' The note accompanies a sentence in which Rousseau describes natural man as possessing little beyond basic animal attributes; and early in the note itself he raises the question of whether orangs-outang- a group of anthropomorphic animals who had been described by European travelers-might not actually be a race of "savage men" who "had not had an opportunity to develop any of its potential faculties, had not acquired any degree of perfection, I would like to thank Roger D.

If we are to appreciate the political implications of Rousseau's use of nature we need to ensure that we properly situate his discussion within the context of eighteenth-century thought. In this regard I am building on Gourevitch's insightful analysis of the Discourse.4 As Gourevitch notes, one of the more important interpretive questions surrounding this work is whether its account of the pure state of nature and human natural history is to be taken as factual (as the evolutionist interpretation suggests) or conjec- tural. Following Gourevitch, I believe the account should be read as conjectural, but we should recognize that the plausibility of its conjectures rests in part on their compatibility with available evidence. Elsewhere I have argued that Rousseau's portrait of natural man is based on accounts of primates and primitive human populations readily accessible in the nature writing of the day.5 In this article I examine his discussion of pongos and other orangs-outang and argue that his speculation on the possible in- clusion of these creatures in the human species has less to do with his special insights on human descent than with the political point to be made were it indeed the case. Rousseau uses contem- porary reports of orangs-outang like the pongo to construct a viable model for criticizing his contemporary Europe and to defend his claim that the kind of political inequalities associated with late European society do not issue from God or nature but are accidental events in the life of the species.

After all, it is built around a long quotation describing a particular type of orang-outang called a pongo, and both terms bear strong simi- larities to modern scientific nomenclature (the orangutan's for- mal name is Pongo pygmaeus). Given this rough similarity, it is not uncommon to find both translations of and commentary on the Discourse equating Rousseau's orang-outang with the modern orangutan or one of the other great apes.6 Yet when we look at the text, the only animals mentioned specifically are what are referred to as several different types of orang-outang-pongos, enjockos, quojas-morros, beggos, and mandrills-and all but the first of these are mentioned only in passing. Before we examine any possible evolutionist implications of Rousseau's discussion it seems we first ought to be clear about the particular animals he mentions; for by examining the representations of the various orangs in Note X we can better appreciate Rousseau's uncertainty as to whether these were animals or primitive human beings. However this is not as straightforward a task as one might think. Although by the time Rousseau was working on the Discourse European naturalists had for at least a century been discussing what we recognize as the great apes, a standard nomenclature had not yet been codified.7 Thus we find some species identified by a variety of different names and similar names applied to what we now recognize as different species. No doubt some of this confusion results from the fact that, as Gourevitch reminds us, very few naturalists at this time had actually seen a living orang-outang, much less subjected them to systematic study.8 Too often what information 6.

Not to be overly facetious here, but it is quite likely that an average five year old today would be much better informed about these animals than almost any eighteenth-century naturalist. The type of orang receiving the fullest treatment in Note X is the pongo; perhaps because it was one of the first of these ani- mals to be described in the literature, had been discussed with some regularity for the better part of a century, and, as Blanckaert notes, served as something of an archetype for subsequent de- scriptions of the great apes for the next two centuries.9 While the lengthy description of this animal included in Note X is based on Andrew Battel's original report in Samuel Purchas's Hakluytus Posthumous, or Purchas his Pilgrimes (1625),10 it bears noting that this was not the text Rousseau used. Instead he quotes from a French translation of the account included in an anthology of travel writing compiled by Antoine-Francois, 1 abbe Prevost.11 Reading the passage Rousseau cites, one is struck almost immediately by the pongo's extraordinary resemblance to hu- man beings, so that someone with no direct knowledge of the creature would have been hard pressed not to imagine it as a particularly primitive human being. In terms of its physical ap- pearance, the pongo is said to have a human face ["une visage humain"] and to bear an exact resemblance with man ["une ressemblance exacte avec l'homme"]. Indeed, the major physical trait distinguishing these creatures from human beings is their different leg musculature: although bipeds, pongos lack a calf muscle.12 Turning to pongo behavior we see that it too seems to follow human patterns, with Prevost mentioning several traits common 9.

For instance, like Europeans, pongos are said to bury their dead. Given that at this time interment tended to be associated with religious ritual, a European audience could plausibly infer that pongos might have a primitive religious understanding. We are also told that pongos build shelters in trees to protect themselves from the rain and that they gather around campfires abandoned by local human populations (but apparently are unable either to light or tend a fire by themselves).13 These are not trivial tasks at least insofar as Prevost included descriptions of human populations unable to perform them: the African natives of Bomma reportedly lived in trees in uncovered structures made of leaves and branches, and the people of Teneriffe were said to be ignorant of the use of fire.14 Similarly, in the survey of the human species published in the third volume of his Natural History (1753), Buffon reports that the natives of New Holland "sleep on the ground without any covering" and that those of the Marianna Islands needed European guidance in order to learn how to light and use a fire.'5 Finally, pongos are said to attack and occasionally kidnap African people, a behavior that may have had some resonance in a European audience. Prevost recounts Battel's anecdote of hav- ing met an African boy who was abducted and spent a month living among these animals.'6 If the report is accurate, notice that the extended length of this abduction implies that the pongos were sufficiently intelligent or powerful to prevent the boy's escape, or that the boy felt relatively comfortable with the pongos and did not attempt to escape. So while Prevost does not state directly whether pongos have the linguistic or intellectual skills of human beings, he does seem to indicate that their overall intelligence compares favorably to that of at least some human populations. 13.

According to Prevost, this animal had fully human legs, human hands, and a face that resembled that of a man. And, as with the pongo, it behaved in a passably human manner. This particular orang, for instance, is said to have readily adopted the elegant table manners expected in upper-class Euro- pean society, to have slept in a bed and when doing so to have covered itself so skillfully that it could have been mistaken for a sleeping person.17 Prevost included an illustration of this orang (see Figure 1), giving Rousseau a fairly clear idea about its overall appearance. * . . .. ..

But of the other types mentioned, all but the enjocko were discussed at some length and in similar ways in Prevost's anthology; that is Prevost regularly draws attention to their overall human appearance and behavior.18 For instance, we are told that the beggo or mandrill walks erect, has a "truly human figure," and that it cries "like a child" when teased. The follow- ing page presents an account of an orang outang from Borneo which begins by emphasizing its overall human appearance and goes on to relate that the resemblance is so compelling that the natives and most Europeans believe it to be a savage man.19 The same volume also includes an account of other apes said to be capable of speaking but who refuse to do so lest they be taken as slaves.20 Recall that in Note X Rousseau suggests that some Euro- pean travelers failed to include some creatures as members of the human species "solely because these animals did not speak."21 Prevost's emphasis on the human appearance and behavior of the orangs-outang is quite common in the contemporary literature. European naturalists and travelers routinely claimed that orangs walked like human beings, and illustrations of these animals generally depict them as bipeds (frequently accompanied with a walking stick or other supporting tool). So while Rousseau would have seen in Prevost's anthology a rather striking portrait of a "chimpaneze" standing with a cane (Figure 2) that would lend credence to his suggestion that these animals might be human beings, similar drawings can be found throughout the literature.22 18. The enjocko is an exception because it was mentioned but not described in Hakluytus Posthumus. Purchas relates that Battel forgot to discuss it, consequently no account of the animal appears in HGV. 19. Pr6vost, HGV, 4: 240-41. 20. Ibid., 3: 293-94. 21. SD, p. 81.

The Literary History of the Pongo By using Prevost as his source for information about the pongo, Rousseau was relying on what was at best a third hand account, a fact frequently overlooked in commentary on the Quadrupeds, 3rd ed. (Newcastle upon Tyne, 1792).

So before examining Rousseau's use of the pongo I think it instructive to compare the French and English descriptions of these animals; for the differences between the various accounts provide some insight into an important trend in eighteenth-century natural history that seems to have gone unnoticed in more recent discussion of Rousseau's evolu- tionism. In examining these three descriptions of the pongo, we see that both Green and Prevost make several apparently minor changes to Purchas's report which nonetheless have the impor- tant effect of creating a more human appearance for the pongo. For that matter, we find that throughout the eighteenth century a more human-like pongo emerges the further we recede from Purchas's original. To begin with, Purchas describes how the pongo "hath a mans [sic] face" and is "in all proportion like a man." In Green's version the pongo becomes a bit more human. Its face is now said to be "like that of a Man" and its body "proportioned exactly like man." As we have seen, by the time Prevost translates the account the pongo has a "human face" and a body bearing an "exact resemblance" to human form.25 What Prevost and Green omit from Purchas's report is almost as important as their embellishments. Neither of them include Purchas's observation that pongos "cannnot speake, and have no understanding more than a beast."26 Since both of these claims would seem to indicate that pongos are not human beings or at least leave much less room for including them as members of the human species, their omission 23. In his editorial notes to the Discourse, Masters notes that Green was Provost's source for the discussion of the pongo but does not discuss the differences between the various descriptions of the animal; see SD, p. 186. 24.

Purchas, Hakluytus Posthumus, 5: 398. 650</page><page sequence="11">ROUSSEAU'S THEORY OF MAN deepens the impression that pongos might be especially primitive members of the human species. Changes to Purchas's description seem to have occurred with some regularity in the eighteenth-century discussion of the pongo, and these changes tended to create a more human appearance for the animal. The entry in Diderot's Encyclopedie (1755) enhances the implied religiosity of pongo burial practices by describing how the local human population regards as a "sort of sepulcher" the mounds of leaves and branches that pongos use to bury their dead. This account is also much more explicit in affirming that these creatures are more than mere animals, concluding that they should be placed in a class superior to that of other animals.7 Obviously the only alternatives would be creating a new class or admitting them as members of the human species. Buffon's discussion of the pongo is intriguing. Although Buffon consistently maintained a sharp distinction between the human species and other animal species, he nonetheless adds two changes to Purchas's original which add to the pongo's human traits. When he discusses the pongo in volume 14 of his Natural History (1766), he includes Battel's report of the kidnap- ping incident, but he extends the length of the boy's abduction from one month to one year. Second, he translates Purchas's report that the pongo is speechless and has "no understanding more than a beast" as "although they cannot speak, they have more understanding than other animals" ("qui'il ne peut parler quoiqui'il ait plus d'entendement que les autre animaux," my emphasis).28 This assessment effectively supports the idea that pongos are something more than mere animals and are therefore more nearly human. As far as I have been able to determine both of these changes originate with Buffon. Both enhance the already considerable resemblance between pongos and human beings and ironically both are soon introduced into English. A translation of 27.

Ashley Montagu (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1959), p. 24. I 651</page><page sequence="12">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS Buffon's work completed by naturalist William Smellie (1781), as well as descriptions of the pongo by Lord Monboddo (1773) and Oliver Goldsmith (1774) all use the year figure in discussing the kidnapping incident; and despite citing Purchas as his source, Monboddo repeats the claim that pongos have more understand- ing than other animals.9 Of course this transformation of the pongo into a quasi- human creature raises the question of what could have prompted such a change. One clue may be found in a final difference between Purchas's original, Green's summary, Prevost's translation, and the Encyclopedie entry. Both Green and Prevost preface their discussion of the pongo by listing it as a type of orang-outang and claiming that it is a kind of "mid-point" between human beings and baboons.30 Purchas's original makes no such comparison. Just as the relationship between human beings and the great apes is an important concern in Darwinian theory, so too was it a concern for eighteenth century natural philosophers, but for quite different reasons. For most of these naturalists, nature was understood to be a product of purposive divine creation, with perhaps the fullest expression of this idea found in the so-called chain of being. Throughout the Enlightenment we find naturalists preoccupied arranging species along a continuum descending from God and linking each part of His creation.31 The meaning of the 29.

Blanckaert, in his discussion of the pongo, does not cite Purchas directly but rather Huxley's quotation of Buffon's (mis)translation, and so describes Battel as claiming that the pongo has more intelligence than other animals; see Blanckaert, "Premier des singes," p. 115. 30.

The discovery of the orangs-outang was important for eighteenth-century naturalists not for what these animals could tell us about human descent, but for what they revealed about the viability of the chain of being and the position of human beings within that chain.32 The preconceptions associated with this understanding of nature profoundly influenced European assessments of orangs- outang and so-called primitive human populations. The apparent uniqueness of human consciousness and spirituality seemed to raise special difficulties for a theory which presented nature as a continuum. For instance, Rousseau, Voltaire, and Buffon all refer to this gap in rejecting the idea of a natural continuum.33 One way to address this criticism was to arrange the human species as a hierarchy and then emphasize the physical and behavioral This is not to say that all naturalists or natural philosophers adopted this reading of nature. But just as post-Darwinian theory manages to accommodate substantial debate and disagreements (over such issues as punctuated equilibria, selfish genes, and genetic drift) within a fundamental acceptance of a more general theory, so too could the chain of being. So while we see the occasional outright rejection of the theory, more often than not we see qualifications, modifications, and amendments. Rousseau for instance, rejected a strict reading of the principle of continuity and strongly criticized some of the normative applications of the theory, but otherwise defended it. Developing a full treatment of Rousseau's understanding of and appreciation for the chain of being is beyond the scope of the present article, but for his direct criticism of the theory see Rousseau, "Lettre d Francois-Joseph de Conzie, comte des Charmettes, le 17 janvier 1742," in Correspondance complete, 1:132-39.

III</page><page sequence="14">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS similarities of those populations presumed to be closest to the break-that is, apes and the peoples on the lower rung of the human ladder.34 The human hierarchy was routinely shown to begin with Europeans and then descend through the peoples of Asia before continuing down to the native populations of sub-Saharan Africa, the South Pacific, or the Americas. Rousseau would have seen versions of this hierarchy both in Prevost's anthology, and, despite its rejection of the principle of continuity, Buffon's Natural History. For those who wished to support the chain of being, distinctions between the groups at the bottom of the human ladder and the orangs at the top of the animal hierarchy were blurred (whether consciously or not) to the point where it became difficult to determine the end of the human species and the beginning of brute animals.35 Given this context Rousseau's suggestion that orangs-outang might be human beings takes on a much different light. He is not offering a theory of human origins as understood in Darwinian terminology so much as he is extending the range of the human species as it currently exists. It is not all that unusual to find similar claims in the writing of the period.

In Note X Rousseau draws attention to this problem. In the middle of the note he reexamines the claim that pongos enjoy sitting around an abandoned campfire and wonders how either Battel or Purchas came to the conclusion that the pongos' failure to tend the fire resulted from their inability to do so rather than their desire not to do so. As he notes, pongos reportedly engage in other sophisticated behavior-including building their own shelters and burying their dead-so that tending a fire does not appear to be all that complex a task. Moreover, as he notes in his Essay on the Origin of Languages, fire is useful to human beings in a variety of important ways besides food preparation and warmth.38 It provides visual enjoyment and becomes a centerpiece for all sorts of social interaction. So the fact that pongos gather around campfires might be further evidence of their humanity and increases the likelihood that they may be people who have been misidentified by careless travelers.39 Rousseau expresses his doubts about the kind of reporting naturalists were receiving at that time and holds out the hope that our knowledge will improve when we receive better reports from more reliable sources. In creating his portrait of natural human beings, however, he shows himself to be quite willing to take these travelers at their word and to accept their picture of the orang-outang. 37.

Is Rousseau not suggesting the possibility of evolution within the human species if not within nature at large? Perhaps the best way to begin to answer this type of objection is to note that we should resist the temptation to read our Darwinian concerns into Rousseau's pre-Darwinian context. Perfectibility, like the discussion of orangs-outang, might best be viewed in terms of the immediate political point to be made in response to contemporary debates. In particular, I would suggest that it should be read within the context of eighteenth-century discussion on the unity of the human species and should be taken as part of Rousseau's attempt to defend the claim that all human beings are members of a single species. In other words, the discovery of orangs-outang and (for lack of a better term) "primitive" people essentially forced the issue of perfectibility inasmuch as once we concede the basic accuracy of the traveler's reports, we must accept either multiple human species or a single species capable of some change through time. Recall that Note X begins with a brief survey of the diversity in such human physical traits as skin color, hair texture, body size, and presence or absence of a tail, and that it is this diversity which prompts Rousseau to offer his suggestions on the true standing of orangs-outang.40 The variety within the human spe- cies-most obviously seen in the existence of nonwhite peoples- posed special difficulties for Enlightenment conceptions of the species: naturalists needed to account for the (apparently) wide divergence of some groups from the (presumed) European norm. While the most common explanation granted that non-European peoples said to occupy the lower rungs of the human ladder were members of the same species as white Europeans, other explana- tions denying this claim were circulating in Europe at this time. 40. Rousseau, SD, p. 80. Buffon and de Maillet mention several accounts of human populations with tails; see Buffon, "Varieties of the Human Species," p. 87; and de Maillet, Telliamed, pp. 202-206. I 656</page><page sequence="17">ROUSSEAU'S THEORY OF MAN For some, the differences among the major human popula- tions seemed to be sufficiently large to warrant the designation of separate species. Although a minority view, polygenesis none- theless had some influential proponents.4' Since the idea of a single human species owed as much to religious dogma as it did to scientific evidence, the counterclaim for multiple human spe- cies was able to find an audience among some naturalists and philosophes who were not particularly concerned with upholding religious orthodoxy.42 Obviously, this is a crucial question for Rousseau. If his discussion of natural man is to become a foil for criticizing contemporary Europe, and if that description is culled from European reports of the world's primitive populations, then it is essential that these people be included in the same species as Europeans.43 If this were not the case, he could have been vulnerable to questions about their relevance to the kind of European political problems that he was addressing. He therefore needed a definition of the human species which not only recognized a single species but also accommodated the diversity within the species. In other words, he needed an account of human natural history which could explain how orangs-outang might become Europeans (or vice-versa). As he does so often in the Discourse on questions concerning the details of natural history, Rousseau turned to Buffon for that definition.44 According to Buffon, a species was comprised of 41.

First, morphological similarity is no longer a relevant criterion in grouping members into a particular species.46 Second, inasmuch as species are a succession of individuals, Buffon's definition adds a temporal dimension not seen in contemporary alternative definitions.47 In terms of classifying human beings, Buffon noted the evident capacity for interbreeding among the members of the various human populations and argued for a single species in which Europeans were the most natural form and other populations represented successive degeneration from this original stock.48 Buffon did not discuss the mechanics of this degenerative process in any great detail but it does not appear as though it should be read with evolutionist connotations.49 Ironically, while his definition helped pave the way for subsequent evolutionist theory, Buffon himself rejected this hypothesis. In his article on the ass (also included in volume 3) he eloquently rebuts the transformist or evolutionist hypothesis.50 For Buffon, diversity and change in the human form were a consequence of climate and social organization rather than genetic mutation or some other reproductive process. He claimed, moreover, that while Aspects of a Relationship," Publications of the Modem Language Association of America 75 (1960): 184-96; Jean Starobinski, "Rousseau and Buffon," in Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Transparency and Obstruction, trans.

For example he speculates that dark skin pigmentation could be "bleached" in a century or two once the population exhibiting this trait was relocated to a cooler climate.51 Rousseau appears to have adopted Buffon's understanding of species. Recall that one of the means offered in Note X for determining whether orangs-outang might be members of the human species is a breeding experiment in which the suggested test-multigenerational reproductive success-alludes to Buffonian criteria.52 Although he expresses some reservations on actually performing the experiment, we should note that he could reasonably have expected it to succeed. Europeans had by this time produced a fairly substantial record of anecdotal evidence affirming that the sexual appetites of Africans were not confined to human partners, and that orangs-outang might be the product of human-simian copulation.53 To be sure this biological answer is not the only means Rousseau considers, but it clearly indicates a familiarity with Buffon's conception of species and a willing- ness to invoke it on a crucial point. Rousseau's account of changes in the physical appearance of human beings also seems to follow in broad outline Buffon's discussion of the human species: there is but a single species despite what the variation in outward appearances might otherwise indicate. Like Buffon, Rousseau is both unconcerned with morphological similarity and rather vague about the details of the developmental process of the species. Throughout his outline of human history in part two of the Discourse he repeatedly confesses his inability to explain the transition between the different stages of human development.

Rousseau was not as concerned with how the process of species degeneration might operate so much as the fact that it operate and that it yield the history of a single species rather than the varying histories of multiple species. One might object that this characterization is unfair or at least misleading since both Buffon and Rousseau refer to a kind of struggle for existence within nature, and this idea could obviously provide a powerful explanation for the evolutionary process. One of the passages in the Discourse that has garnered special attention occurs early in part one when Rousseau claims that "Nature treats them [i.e., natural human beings] precisely as the law of Sparta treated the children of citizens: it renders strong and robust those who are well constituted and makes all the others perish."54 While I will grant that this passage bears at least a superficial resemblance to Darwinian theory, I think that before we accept this reading we need to make sure that we have correctly grasped the point of the analogy. In his Final Reply (1754) to critics of his Discourse on the Sciences and Arts (1751) Rousseau praises Sparta as the state "where virtue was purest and where it lasted longest," and he goes on to note that it alone remained free while the rest of the Hellenic city-states lapsed into slavery.55 Sparta's attraction was not that it developed institutions and practices which allowed for any evolutionary change (cultural, biological, or otherwise), but that its institutions and practices staved off the degenerative pro- cess which gripped the other Greek states. The point of the analogy is that nature is similarly resistant to change and protects species from degeneration. If anything, the struggle of existence was 54. Rousseau, SD, p. 21.

He argues that when "two facts given as real are to be connected by intermediate facts which are unknown" either history provides us with the facts directly or philosophy allows us to speculate on a plausible history that might connect them.57 Gourevitch presents a careful argument rejecting the evolutionist contention that the two facts Rousseau possesses are aboriginal human beings in a pure state of nature and their descendants.8 I would agree. On closer inspection, it would appear that the two facts Rousseau possesses are the existence of "savages" (including perhaps orangs-outang like the pongo) and "civilized" Europeans. As long as he can show that both of these groups and the various intermediaries between them are all members of the same species, he can safely assume they share a common history. Primitive peoples are thus legitimate models for his critique of the inequalities characteristic of European politics. In Note X Rousseau is willing to accept that time, culture, and the peculiarities of local physical environments have produced variation in the species rather than different human species. This understanding was fully in accord with the idea (endorsed both by Buffon as well as more religiously inclined naturalists) that species could only be created by divine dictate.59 It is in this 56. Buffon understood the struggle for existence as a way for nature to maintain an equilibrium between predator and prey species. In his Essay on the Origin of Language, however, Rousseau questions the validity of even this limited use of the idea. See Buffon, "The Natural History of the Hare," NH, 4: 139; and "A Dissertation on Carnivorous Animals," NH, 4: 164-65; and Rousseau, FSD, p. 270. 57. Rousseau, SD, p. 42. 58. Gourevitch, "Rousseau's Pure State of Nature," pp. 35-36. 59. This view is most closely associated with preformationist theories of embryology and the origin of species, which as Sloan notes, was the most widely held theory of generation in mid-century. Rousseau's reference to the "first Embryo of the species" in the first paragraph of part one may be an allusion to this theory. Buffon offered an alternative to preformationism, but accepted the idea that the origin of species-apart from their reproduction and degeneration- was a product of divine creation. See Rousseau, SD, p. 20; Buffon, "Second View 661</page><page sequence="22">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS context that we can appreciate the real significance of Rousseau's decision to draw on accounts of primates and primitive human beings for his definition of the natural condition of the species. The stages of human development outlined in part two of the Discourse correspond to the levels assigned to different human populations within the chain of being. Its account begins with orangs-outang or other primitive human beings and then gradually moves to Europeans; an arrangement which reverses the Buffonian trajectory of human history and inverts the most common European description of the human hierarchy. According to Rousseau's schema these primitive populations come to represent the Creator's intention for the species. Thus, Rousseau ingeniously appropriates the chain of being for his own political purposes. He takes the (perhaps embellished) reports of the orangs-outang and other primitives and uses them to define the original model of the species and then demonstrates that such people would not suffer the kind of inequalities endured by his contemporary Europeans. In other words, it is neither God nor His creation (i.e., nature) but human beings themselves who bear responsibility for the way in which human history has unfolded.60 By introducing the concept of perfectibility to describe the process of human natural history, Rousseau is accepting something like Buffon's terminology. For if Buffon can describe the transition from Europeans to Africans as one of degeneration, then I suppose the reverse process could, on similar criteria, be described as perfectibility. Rousseau himself, however, has serious reservations about these criteria. As he will later remark to a critic, one of his aims in the Discourse was to show Europeans "the miseries of a condition which they take to be the perfection of the species" (my emphasis).61 The discussion of pongos and primitive human beings in this work extends and elaborates ideas present throughout his early philosophical works, including of Nature (1764)," in NH, 7:95; Sloan "The Gaze of Natural History," p. 133; and Jacques Roger, Les sciences des la vie dans la penseefrancaise du XVIIIe siecle (Paris: Armand Colin, 1963). 60.

His conception of natural human beings-based on the traveler's reports of orangs- outang like the pongo and primitive peoples like the Hottentots- is of a people who may lack the intellectual and creative skills of a contemporary European, but who despite these supposed disadvantages, are healthier, happier, and freer than these same Europeans. One of the most important questions he raises centers on the relative importance of these different standards. Conclusion Perhaps some of the urgency to read Rousseau as an evolutionist could have been avoided had more attention been paid to his response to Charles Bonnet's critique of the Second Discourse. Bonnet addresses Rousseau's discussion in Note X and flatly denies that orangs-outang and monkeys are parts of the human species.6 In his reply, Rousseau agrees with him about monkeys, but adds that given the available evidence, it is much more difficult to make the same claim for orangs. In examining that evidence, I think we would have to agree. Rousseau then asks Bonnet to tell him how he answered the question so conclusively: You philosophize too well to pronounce about that [i.e., the inclusion of orangs in the human species] as lightly as our travelers who sometimes risk without much ceremony placing their peers in the ranks of beasts. You will surely oblige the public, then, and you will even instruct naturalists by telling us the means you used to decide this question.64 In effect, Rousseau is asking Bonnet for a definition of the human species. The orangs-outang of Note X are part of his own answer to 62.
