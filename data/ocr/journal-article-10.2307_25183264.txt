The significance of the routes from the Indian Subcontinent to Central Asia across the Pamirs and the Karakoram has long been known. These routes formed the staple of British Indian exploration literature and have figured in various governmental reports and historical writings. However, the corresponding archaeological details have not been very supportive in all sectors. Although Aurel Stein followed some of these routes, he could not offer much archaeological evidence on the subcontinental side beyond the Buddhist relics in Swat. From this point of view, the scholarly</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 441 speculations on Alexander's lines of movements in the Northwest Frontier have not been particularly productive either. Stein's own historical geographical work in the context of ancient Kashmir focussed to some extent on the alignments of these routes which also touched Kashmir, but again, not much archaeology could be offered. The same is true of A. Francke's report on Ladakh, which, apart from odd Kushan period inscriptions and what he called Dard Graves, could not archaeologically mark out the routes. On the archaeological side progress has been made only in recent years. The Italian work on the Buddhist remains in Swat and the subsequent expansion of this base to include protohistoric excavations and explorations in the whole area between Peshawar and Chitral, and the University of Peshawar's excavations of protohistoric and historic sites contributed substantially not merely towards the elucidation of archaeological sequence but also the nature of this area's interaction with Central Asia. Outside the Italian and Peshawar groups two persons have contributed substantially to this field of study, taking it, in fact, beyond Swat-Chitral to the Karakoram Highway stretch of the Gilgit Agency in the Upper Indus valley. One of them is A. H. Dani to whom the present volume is dedicated and whose monograph on Chilas (to the east of Oshibat, the site of the present volume) is an important document. The second person is the Heidelberg Central Asia expert K. Jettmar whose research interests may be said to have been at the roots of the present study. Meanwhile, relevant discoveries have been made on the Indian side in Kashmir and Ladakh. The highlights are a third millennium B.C. neolithic culture with aceramic and earlier prehistoric antecedence, an iron-using megalithic level of mid-second millennium B.C., some major early historic excavations and explor ations, and finally, some camp sites in Ladakh which, even if one ignores the lone date suggesting fifth millennium B.C. for them, should date at least from 800-1000 B.C. On the whole, this wide region has a special niche in South Asian archaeological and historical studies and enough evidence has accumulated on the nature and routes of trans-Himalayan trade in this sector through the ages. In Pakistan the current focus is on detailing the inscriptions and rock engravings by the side of the Karakoram Highway in the Gilgit Agency. The work under review documents such data from only one locality, Oshibat which is about 20 km to the west of Chilas and south of the Indus. The basic types of finds comprise inscriptions and rock engravings. The earliest group of inscriptions is in Kharosthi and falls between the first century B.C. and the first/second century A.D. Most of the inscriptions are in Brahmi and span the time-bracket fourth-eighth centuries A.D. There are also some Sogdian inscriptions whose chronological range is the same as that of the Brahmi ones. These inscriptions seldom go beyond personal names and are thus unexciting historically. However, as markers of people who travelled along the Upper Indus valley they bring a touch of human reality to the ancient counterpart of the modern Karakoram Highway. They declare that "Jivachandra went this way" or that there was a "purohita" called Kirtibhusana. There are a few Urdu inscriptions as well, pointing towards the continuation of the use of this road to Central Asia in recent times. Rock engravings are abundant but cannot be dated on their own. They are, of course, likely to belong to the period of the inscriptions. They cover a wide range of themes, from stylized human figures to stupas, ibex and markhors. The detailed list includes anthropomorphic symbol, tree, building, flower, blossom, caprid, human-like figure, trident, horse and horse-rider, mythical animal, big cat, female figure, footprints, vessel, divinity, hand, hermaphrodite, mythical creature with the body offish and the head of horse, stag, horns, dog, hunter, hunting scene, battle scene, human head, circle, cross, warrior, markhor, ornament, phallus, cup marks, bird, sheep, star, stupa, ibex, dancing scene, etc. Everything is neatly catalogued and correspondingly illustrated by photographs (some of them in colour) and drawings. There is an Urdu summary of the German text at the end and there is a map showing the details of the findspots in the Oshibat locality. Those who are interested in the subcontinent's feeder routes to the main Silk Route cannot ignore this well-documented publication. Dilip K. Chakrabarti</page></plain_text>
