<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEORY AND PRACTICE IN LATE ANCIENT ASCETICISM Jerome, Chrysostom, and Augustine Elizabeth A. Clark A decade ago, I pondered how Jerome and John Chrysostom, leading theoreticians and practitioners of asceticism in late ancient Christendom, squared their ascetic theories with their practice of friendships with women. One important factor linking theory and practice, I concluded, was that the women as well as the men were ascetics who had divested themselves of often considerable property, family, and sexual relations, indeed of sexual identification itself. For these circles, asceticism meant an erasure of sexual difference between males and females, of social difference between aristo crats (the women) and nonaristocrats (the men), and a possibility for intellec tual intersexual friendships of a kind difficult if not impossible otherwise to sustain in late ancient society. For our contemporaries, the practice of friendships between men and women in these circles provides a pleasing counterpart to the harshness of Jerome's and Chrysostom's marital and sexual theories. 1 When I argued this case, I did not yet have Augustine in mind as a subject for investigation. If I had, I would have confronted different evi dence, requiring a different explanation, than that I had amassed for Jerome and John Chrysostom. Whereas the ascetics Jerome and Chrysostom articu lated highly antisexual, antimarital, and antireproductive strategies in their theological writings, they at the same time cultivated close relationships with women; the ascetic Augustine, by contrast, who developed relatively-I emphasize relatively-prosexual, premarital, and proreproductive theories, had no close female friends in his mature years. To the contrary, Augustine's relationships with actual women in his adult life, as revealed in his correspon dence, were more frequently characterized by misunderstanding and suspi cion than by friendly encouragement. Although he occasionally needed the I thank members of the Triangle Area Reading Group on Medieval and Renaissance Women (especially Judith Bennett) and two anonymous readers of this essay for their comments. I also thank Peter Brown and Alan Cameron for specific suggestions. 1 Elizabeth A.

What factors might explain this difference? Several approaches to this question suggest themselves, but they are not equally convincing. The first-the least satisfactory-appeals to an individu alistic explanation: the psychologies of the men involved. The second looks to the theological climate in which the three men elaborated their views. The third examines the social-historical situations of the male authors and their female correspondents-for it is the letters written by Jerome, Chrysostom, and Augustine that contain the primary evidence. The first approach, that of personal psychology, holds limited explana tory power for the divergences just noted, both because we know so little about the families or sexual developments of Jerome and John Chrysostom, and because many modern understandings of these topics rest on assump tions that have dubious applicability to antiquity. The silence of the sources poses a first, obvious problem for the historian. Jerome, for example, makes almost no mention of his parents in his many letters. His silence might suggest that he had not enjoyed good relationships with them, or, less significantly, might merely reflect his indifference to family concerns.3 As for his sexual development, Jerome bemoans his inability to claim the title of virgin, having "fallen" in his youth. He also confesses that despite the severe ascetic practices he adopted during his early retreat to the Syrian desert, visions of dancing girls still floated through his head.4 These slim and rather innocent data do not, I think, warrant J. N. D. Kelly's conclusion that Jerome was "strongly sexed but also, because of his convictions, strongly repressed as well."5 From Chrysostom, on the other hand, we have no reference to any early sexual interest.6 Chrysostom briefly delayed his entry to the priesthood both 2 See the new letter of Augustine to Fabiola in Rome, soliciting her support against Antoninus of Fussala, Ep. 20* (CSEL 88.94-111); commentary in Henry Chadwick, "New Letters of St. Augustine," Journal of Theological Studies 34 (1983): 440-45; Serge Lancel, "Notes complementaires, Lettre 20*," Oeuvres de Saint Augustin, 46B: Lettres 1*-29* (Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1987), 516-20.

In Ep. 82.2 (CSEL 55.109), Jerome suggests that his home was a Christian one. In Ep. 66.1-2 (CSEL 54.665), he mentions commissioning his brother to sell the remains of the family property. 4 Jerome, Epp. 49 (48). 20; 22.7 (CSEL 54.385, 153). 5 J.N.D.

That he admired and loved her seems evident from his writings,7 and thus provides counterevidence to the thesis of Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson that all ascetics must have suffered from harsh and unloving parents.8 In any event, the literature pertaining to Jerome and Chrysostom provides limited information from which the psychohistorian might construct a psychological portrait that could explain their later theological and personal predilections. The data for Augustine are richer: there is no denying this claim. Thanks to the Confessions, we know considerably more about Augustine's childhood and youth-at least as retrospectively constructed9-than we do about those of Jerome and Chrysostom. Reading the Confessions, we are struck by the deep regard in which Augustine held his mother Monica,10 and are perhaps equally struck by his inattention to his father. (That his father was not a baptised Christian during Augustine's youth, nor did he foster the ascetic virtues so central to Augustine's later theology, may account in part for this slight.)l We feel Augustine's poignant suffering when, upon his engagement to a ten-year-old girl of an appropriate social class, he separated from his beloved concubine of perhaps fifteen years, the mother of his adored son Adeodatus. Although he wrote about this separation fifteen years after the event, his remembered pain is palpable: "The woman with whom I had been 1.1-4 (PG 48.623-24) might lead moderns to suspect a homosexual tendency-as might Augustine's Confessiones 3.1.1 (CCL 27.27) (how did friendship become "muddied with lewdness"?) and 4.4.7-4.6.11 (CCL 27.43-46), if we had no other evidence about Au gustine. Different understandings of male friendship in antiquity and different rhetorical expressions concerning its power should, however, caution us from leaping to such conclusions. 7 John Chrysostom, De sacerdotio 1.5 (PG 48.624-25). The entire treatise argues that the priesthood is so lofty and fearsome that Chrysostom felt inadequate to its demands. See the famous story of Libanius's(?) remark on hearing that Chrysostom's mother had lived in widowhood for twenty years: "What women there are among the Christians!" Chrysostom tells the story in Ad viduamjuniorem 2 (PG 48.601). 8 J. Moussaieff Masson, "The Psychology of the Ascetic," Journal of Asian Studies 35 (1976): 623. Testimony concerning the relationships between Augustine and his mother, and between Macrina and Gregory of Nyssa and their mother, provide further disconfir mation from the patristic era. 9 On the dangers of completely trusting Augustine's retrospections, see Paula Fredriksen, "Paul and Augustine: Conversion Narratives, Orthodox Traditions, and the Retrospective Self," Journal of Theological Studies 37 (1986): 3-34. 10 On Monica, see Augustine, Confessiones, especially 1.11.17; 3.11.19-20; 5.9.16-17; 6.1.1; 8.12.30; 9.8.17-9.13.36 (CCL 27.9-10, 37-38, 65-67, 73-74, 131-32, 142-54). Augustine in the Confessions, of course, was recording his mature construction of the centrality of his mother's influence on his life. Whether his mother's presence had in actuality been a dominant feature of his youth remains less certain. 11 Augustine testifies that his father was a pagan when Augustine was small, was am bitious for his son, and was unfaithful and hot-tempered toward his mother (Confessiones 1.11.17; 2.3.5-6; 9.9.19-20 [CSEL 27.10, 19-20, 145-46]).

If Augustine's devotion to at least two women shows him capable of deep feeling, how might we account for the absence of friendships with women in his mature years? Are we to imagine that relationships with his mother and his forever-unnamed concubine satisfied his desire for asso ciation with women for the rest of his life? Or conversely, that the emotions evoked by these relationships were so powerful that, as an ascetic, he was wary of ever again allowing such attachments to bind his heart and mind? The latter is suggested by Possidius, Augustine's biographer, who says that Augustine was so scrupulous in his dealings with women, he would not allow female relatives to stay in his episcopal residence nor would he interview women without a chaperone.13 It is also suggested by Augustine's apparent lack of association with women during the early years of his episcopate, if we infer correctly from the complete absence of letters to women until 408 A.D. Augustine's "psychology" becomes even more problematic when we consider one other fact: that he had at least one sister, absent from the Confessions, whom he mentions only in passing after she died. Her absence from the book suggests that she played no part in his spiritual or intellectual development. We discover that she was the head of a group of women religious whose community was in Hippo Regius, where Augustine was bishop. Only when a problem arose among the nuns after his sister's death does Augustine make reference to her. That this was a flesh-and-blood sister, not a "sister in Christ," is confirmed by Augustine's biographer, Possidius.14 The sister's monastery provided an ideal setting in which Augustine could have cultivated close but nonthreatening relationships with ascetic women, had he so desired. That he did not so desire seems evident. In his youth, Augustine deeply valued friendships and participated in a virtual cult of friendship with his young male associates;15 thus his failure to cultivate the bonds of amicitia with ascetic women once he committed himself to the priestly and ascetic life seems all the more problematic. Recently, Gerald Bonner has puzzled over the same question and noted that Augustine apparently enjoyed best the life ordered along the exclusively male lines of "a college common-room or a military mess."16 My own 12 The fifteen-year period is calculated by Emile Schmitt.

Psychological "explanations" of the behavior and attitudes of these long dead theologians are flawed for a second reason as well: Freudian-inspired assumptions of "normal" psychosexual development and family relations are dubiously applied to the ancients. Since both feminist critics of Freud and advocates of a revisionist Freudianism place far more emphasis on the social construction of gender identity than did Freud,17 historians of antiquity would do well to assume a similar modesty in assessing how family structures and sexual expectations affected their subjects' psychological development. Our notions of normalcy and deviance cannot be readily applied to a society in which, for example, slaves who were subject to the violence and sexual whims of their owners were the primary caretakers of the owners' children, or in which a thirty-year-old man's engagement to a ten-year-old girl Augustine's case-raised no eyebrows. Thus the questionable applicability of psychoanalytical theory, as well as the paucity of our sources, precludes an adequate psychohistorical explanation of these theologians. More help, I think, is provided by an examination of the theological, social, and historical circumstances in which Augustine worked, as con trasted with those of Jerome and Chrysostom. To begin, the theological climate in which Augustine developed his theories of marriage and sexuality differed from those in which Jerome or Chrysostom originally elaborated theirs; indeed, Augustine's views were strongly influenced by the attacks on Jerome's antimarital and antisexual propaganda. Although all three church fathers construct theologies that undergird an ascetic preference, their the ologies carry somewhat different ascetic messages. According to Chrysostom, sexual reproduction was not part of God's plan for the first humans: He created Adam and Eve as virgins, and virgins they were presumably intended to stay. Only after the first sin did God permit Festgabe fiir Luc Verheijen, OSA, ed. C. Mayer and K.H. Chelius (Wiirzburg: Augustinus-Verlag, 1987), 270. 17 The twentieth-century women's movement has provided some strong critics of Freud ian theory, from Simone de Beauvoir to Shulamith Firestone, Betty Friedan, Kate Millett, and Dorothy Dinnerstein. Even revisionist interpreters of Freud, such as Juliet Mitchell, who reject a predominantly social interpretation of gender construction, are quick to point out that "psychoanalysis is not a recommendation for a patriarchal society, but an analysis of one," that it is not because of women's "'natural' procreative possibilities but on account of their cultural utilization as exchange-objects . . . that women acquire their feminine definition" (Juliet Mitchell, Psychoanalysis and Feminism [New York: Pantheon, 1974], xv, 407-8.) Recently some fascinating work has been done on Hellenistic and Roman families. See, for example, The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives, ed.

He postulates that if God had wished for there to be more than two humans in paradise, he could have arranged for their multiplication by nonsexual means, just as he had multiplied the angels. Had Adam and Eve preserved their innocence, no bearing of children as we know it would ever have occurred. 18 The message carried by Chrysostom's theology of creation is clear: Virginity is the best means by which to recapture the condition of Paradise before the Fall and anticipate the angelic world to which we shall be assumed after death, a world in which there shall be neither sexual desire nor marriage. In the present age, marriage is simply a concession to human weakness and impurity, or, as Chrysostom more dramatically puts it, to those who are still "caught up in their passions, who desire to live the life of swine and be ruined in brothels."19 Although Chrysostom's phrasing is rhetorically excessive, the substance of his interpretation is not exceptional for Eastern theologians of his era: Gregory of Nyssa's understanding of Eden and the afterlife, for example, is similarly nonbodily in character.20 That these views were not considered deviant in late fourth-century Eastern Christianity is suggested by the relative absence of protest they occasioned-in contrast to the furor that erupted in the Western church when comparable positions were advocated. Jerome paints a similar picture to Chrysostom's of the original human condition, although he does not offer so developed a theology of Paradise. For Jerome, too, the condition of Adam and Eve in Paradise was virginal; only after their sin and their expulsion from Eden did they cease to be virgins. Thus, marriage was instituted only after the Fall. Although Jerome admits that virginity was not given as a commandment but only as a counsel in the New Testament, he nonetheless reminds his readers that the only animals who entered Noah's ark two-by-two, that is, as sexual mates, were the unclean ones. Jerome's conclusion from his reading of Genesis 1-3 is as clear as Chrysostom's: Virginity is the preferred mode of human life, the one hundredfold harvest of the Parable of the Sower, compared to the sixtyfold harvest of widowhood, and the thirtyfold harvest of marriage.21 Jerome's 18 John Chrysostom, De virginitate 14.3, 5, 6 (SC 125.140, 142); Hor 20 Gen. 1 (PG 53. 167); Horn. 18 Gen. 4 (PG 53.154); Propter fornicationes 3 (PG 51.213); De virginitate 14.6; 17.5 (SC 125.142, 144, 154); Horn. 15 Gen. 4 (PG 53.123); De virginitate 14.3, 6 (SC 125.140, 142, 144). 19 John Chrysostom, Hom. 68 Matt. 3 (PG 58.643-44); De virginitate 11.1; 27.2 (SC 125.126, 178); Hom. 6 Col. 4 (PG 62.342): Horn. 18 Gen. 4 (PG 153); De virginitate 15.2; 19.2 (SC 125.146, 158). 20 Gregory of Nyssa, De virginitate, esp. 12-14 (SC 119.398-444). 21 Jerome, AdversusJovinianum 1.4, 16, 12 (cf. 1 Cor. 7:25, 26), 16 (PL 23.225, 246, 237, 246); Epp. 29.2; 66.2; 123.8 (CSEL 54.353, 648; CSEL 56.82); Adversus Jovinianum 1.3 (PL 23.223).</page><page sequence="7">Theory and Practice in Late Ancient Asceticism 31 scheme, however, met with a far more negative reception in the West than Chrysostom's had in the East, and in this difference we find one key to why Augustine's recommendation of marriage was more generous than that of either Chrysostom or Jerome. In the early 390s, Jerome's ascetic views came under sharp attack. To some Western Christians, Jerome and other ascetic enthusiasts were covert "Manicheans,"22 a slanderous code name denoting not an actual disciple of the Persian teacher Mani, but those who disparaged God's creation, es pecially the human body with its reproductive capacities. The chief attack emanated from the Christian writer Jovinian, who believed that baptism not only erased sin, but rendered all the baptized of equal merit. An ascetic should not, on the basis of his or her renunciation alone, condescend to married childbearers. Why, Jovinian asked, should Christian ascetics fancy that they are superior to the Hebrew patriarchs and their wives, who acted in accordance with God's command to "reproduce and multiply"?23 Augustine's theology of Eden must be set squarely against the backdrop of the debate between Jerome and Jovinian in the 390s. How to give a more positive assessment of marriage and reproduction, without necessarily put ting marriage on a par with virginity, was the problem Augustine inherited from this debate. Before Augustine was theologically prepared for this task, however, he had undergone a dramatic change in his own world view.24 As is well known, Augustine had been a Manichean-an actual member of the Manichean church-for about nine years in his youth.25 When he abandoned Manicheanism and began to embrace Catholic Christianity, he learned to read the Old Testament with more spiritual eyes than his Man ichean training had led him to imagine possible. (It had been a Manichean ploy to discredit the Old Testament by ridiculing its anthropomorphism, the 22 Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum 1.3, 5 (PL 23.223, 225-27); Augustine, De nuptiis et concupiscentia 2.23.28; 2.5.15 (PL 44.458, 444-45). 23 Jerome, AdversusJovinianum 1.16, 5 (PL 23.246, 225-28); cf.

On Genesis against the Manichees, composed in 388-389, announced the author's intent to provide a "figurative and enigmatic interpretation of the text."27 So "figurative" is Augustine's interpretation that the words of Genesis 1:28 ("reproduce and multiply") are taken to mean only spiritual, not fleshly, union. Like Jerome and Chrysostom, Augustine here posits that fleshly fecundity came into existence only after the Fall. The reference to the woman's "bringing forth," according to Augustine, means that the first couple will "bring forth" good works.28 Only in 401 and thereafter did Augustine grasp the difficulties of his figurative approach: namely, that the spiritualized interpretation of Genesis 1-3 he had developed to counter Manichean jibes at Old Testament crudities now left him and other Christians open, paradoxically, to the charge of "Manicheanism," that is, the disparagement of the human body that had been created by God. Thus during the first years of the fifth century, in response to the debate between Jerome and Jovinian, Augustine modified his earlier views in ways that had important consequences for his developing theology: He now interprets marriage and reproduction as "goods," on the one hand, and increasingly "despiritualizes" his interpretation of Genesis in favor of an earthier reading of the text, on the other. These tasks he under takes in his treatises On the Good of Marriage, composed in 401, and On Genesis According to the Letter, which he began shortly thereafter. The order of composition suggests that Augustine's exegesis of Genesis 1-3 was decisively influenced by his changing estimation of the worth of marriage.29 On the Good of Marriage is Augustine's attempt to provide a better resolution to the debate between Jerome and Jovinian a decade earlier. He wants to reprove Jovinian (by claiming the superiority of virginity to mar riage) but not fall prey to the charges of"Manicheanism" directed at Jerome. In this work, Augustine repeatedly proclaims marriage to be a "good" that God intended for the human race: We are by nature social beings, whose deepest natural inclinations prompt us to keep company with each other.

Although, like Jerome and John Chrysostom, he affirms that celibacy is "higher" than marriage, he is far more careful than they to uphold God's blessing on marriage. In On the Good of Marriage, however, Augustine does not develop an interpretation of Genesis 1:28, "reproduce and multiply."30 This he begins to do a few years later in On Genesis According to the Letter. As we move with Augustine from book to book of this work, we can trace the progressive modification of his earlier spiritualized interpretation of Genesis. By book 3 of On Genesis According to the Letter, he is asking if the first human did or did not have a mortal body, and what the point of reproduction would have been if death, arising from sin, had not entered the world. He considers whether Adam and Eve could have had sexual union not motivated by lust, but does not know how to answer his own question. By book 9 of the work, however, he has not only answered the question, he has arrived at the position that would carry him through his next two decades of theologizing, namely, that Adam and Eve would have reproduced in Eden even if they had remained sinless.31 This they would have done without lust. They would have commanded the movement of their sexual organs, which would have complied with the ease that now attends commands to our feet and other parts.32 These views are the very ones that much later inform Augustine's debate against the Pelagians in On Marriage and Concupiscence and AgainstJulian, as well as the City of God.33 Moreover, in the latter work Augustine paints a glowing picture of the harmonious companionate mar riage Adam and Eve would have enjoyed in the Garden of Eden if they had not sinned-a very different sketch of marriage than that depicted in the numerous treatises of Jerome and Chrysostom which enumerate the woes of married women, from the nausea of pregnancy to the insubordination of servants and ill-treatment by husbands.34 30 Augustine, De bono coniugali 1.1; 2.2; 8.8; 9.9; 23.28; 26.35 (CSEL 41.187-88, 188 89, 198-201, 223-24, 229-30). 31 Augustine, De Genesi ad litteram 3.21.33; 9.3.6, 9.9.14 (PL 34.293, 395, 398). Even though Augustine here emphasizes Eve's reproductive role rather than her role as Adam's companion, I read this early emphasis in the context of Augustine's development of an earthier exegesis of Genesis 1-2 that contributes to his growing recognition of the goodness of marriage. For a less positive assessment of the passage, see Bonner, "Au gustine's Attitude," 260-61. 32 Augustine, De Genesi ad litteram 9.10.16, 9.10.18 (PL 34.398, 399). 33 Augustine, De nuptiis et concupiscentia 2.31.53 (PL 44.467-68); Contra Julianum 3.7.15, 25, 27 (PL 44.709, 731-32); De civitate Dei 14.23, 26, (CCL 48.444-46, 449-50). 34 Augustine, De civitate Dei 14.26 (CCL 48.449-50).

To be sure, in the controversy with Pelagians, Augustine found his own views on marriage constantly attacked as "Manichean," because of his theory that original sin passed through the sexual act. Although I think that Augustine's refutation of the Pelagian charge was not completely successful,36 his theory of marriage and sexual function ing can doubtless be labelled more positive than those of Jerome and Chrysostom. Thus the theological climate in which Augustine wrote encour aged more support for marriage and reproduction than had that of a decade or two earlier, when Jerome and John Chrysostom developed their theories. Did Augustine's more moderate views on marriage and sexual relations find a correlate in more positive attitudes toward actual flesh-and-blood women? The answer appears, puzzlingly, to be no. Despite Augustine's sensitive, even "progressive," words about the marriage relationship-for example, that marriage was meant to be companionship, or that Joseph and Mary had a genuine marriage, despite their lack of sexual association, because they had a spiritual bond37-his actual relationships with women, as we infer them from his letters, provide little support for the hypothesis that a theory of companionate marriage necessarily correlates with the practice of companionly relationships with women, even within the bounds of ascetic propriety. The percentage of letters addressed to women by Augustine, Jerome, and Chrysostom is itself telling: Whereas 34 percent of Jerome's letters and 23 percent of Chrysostom's are addressed to women, only 7 percent of Augustine's are so designated.38 Moreover, the warm emotion we 35 Augustine, Opus imperfectum contra Julianum 1.68.5; cf. 2.122 (CSEL 851.75, 253); Contra duas epistolas Pelagianorum 1.10 (5); 1.31 (15); 1.35(17) (CSEL 60.431, 448, 451 52); Ep. 6*.5.1; 6.7.2 (CSEL 88. 34, 35-36). 36 Augustine, Contra duas epistolas Pelagianorum 1.3 (1), 4 (2) (CSEL 60.424-25); De nuptiis et concupiscentia 2.35 (20) (CSEL 42.289); Opus imperfectum 1.27.66; 2.27.2, 202; 3.10 (CSEL 851.23.64, 181, 314, 355); 4.47; 6.41 (PL 45.1365, 1604) and many other places.

The results are as follows: for Jerome, there are either 116 or 117 letters total (depending on whether Epistle 46 to Marcella is judged to have been written by Jerome rather than by Paula and</page><page sequence="11">Theory and Practice in Late Ancient Asceticism 35 find expressed in Jerome's and Chrysostom's letters to women is rarely present in Augustine's. Some of this difference, I think, can be accounted for by the circumstances under which the three men composed their correspon dence, and I turn now to an examination of these circumstances. Chrysostom's letters to women all date from the period of his exile, after he was ousted from the bishopric of Constantinople and was suffering the tedium of banishment to the hinterlands of Armenia. Many of the women to whom he wrote were deaconesses, or had worked with him in some capacity connected with church life when he was bishop of Constantinople. Now, in his unhappy solitude, he urged them to write more frequently, to tell him the news about themselves and those dear to them, although the reader soon notes that Chrysostom had almost nothing to report back about himself. In language that cuts through the formal conventions of polite letter writing in late antiquity, he reaffirms the affection that he felt for these women. In his seventeen extant letters to the deaconess Olympias, whom he saw daily in Constantinople and who almost single-handedly supported the ecclesiastical operations of the city, he sings her praises most fulsomely.39 From our perspective, it appears that Chrysostom had too much time on his hands, in contrast to the harried bishop of Hippo Regius; writing letters to his admirers filled lonely hours and forged a link to his happier past. As for Jerome, he had lived in mental and emotional intimacy with his circle of Roman women for three years. He describes their relationship thus: "Our studies made for constant association, which ripened into familiarity, which in turn produced mutual confidence,"40 a near-classic ancient defini tion of friendship. When Jerome left Rome in 385 for Palestine, he was followed by his closest female friend Paula and her ascetically minded Eustochium), 40 of which are written to women; for John Chrysostom, there are 236 letters total, 54 of which were written to women; for Augustine, 257 letters total, including those in the Divjak edition of new letters, of which 19 are written to women in their own right. I have not included treatises dedicated to women; if I had, the percentage of materials to women by Jerome would be even further elevated. My count comes out slightly higher than that of Aline Rousselle, Porneia, De la maitrise du corps d la privation sensorielle II IV siecles de I'ere chretienne (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1983), 231 n.8. 39 For Chrysostom's references to the boredom of life in rural Armenia, see (e.g.) his Epp. 34, 43, 94, 98, 105, 178, 185; Ep. ad Olympiadem 6 (= Migne 13).

With them he founded monasteries for men and women in Bethlehem and had daily contact for the rest of their lives.41 To friends in Rome such as Marcella, he wrote both before and after he left the city, expressing his love and admiration.42 On special occasions, Jerome's letters became virtual treatises, for example, his letter to Eustochium upon her decision for lifelong virginity, or his letter to Paula's daughter-in-law on how to raise an infant daughter, an enterprise with which Jerome certainly had no experience, but for which he nonetheless confidently provides ad vice.43 Indeed, so often and so fervently did Jerome write to women that he felt compelled to defend his practice-in a letter to a woman!44 When we compare Jerome's relationship with female friends to Chrysostom's, we notice some similar patterns. Both men had enjoyed close associations with the women for at least a few years before they wrote most of the letters that constitute our evidence. Moreover, most of the women had made their ascetic renunciations before they met either Jerome or Chrysostom. Olympias, for example, had attempted-despite resistance from governmental authorities-to espouse the ascetic life for a decade or more before Chrysostom became bishop of Constantinople in early 398. She had already waged a successful battle for the right to disperse her own property before Chrysostom ever met her. Thus, there could be no grounds for suspecting that Chrysostom had lured her to an ascetic life with the hope of extracting her extraordinary wealth for the benefit of the church. And although, judging from the anonymously authored Life of Olympias, its heroine was somewhat indiscriminate in entertaining Chrysostom's enemies as well as his friends,45 there is no evidence that she was attracted to any heretical or schismatic group that Chrysostom would have considered prob lematic. Thus the factors that were to cloud some of Augustine's relationships with women are absent from Chrysostom's circumstances. Similar circumstances surround Jerome's relationships with Paula, Mar cella, Lea, and Asella: They had already made their ascetic commitments before they encountered Jerome upon his arrival in Rome in 382.46 Although 41 See Jerome, Ep. 108 for Paula's life, especially sections 6, 14, and 20. In De viris illustribus 135 (PL 23.759), Jerome confesses that he doesn't know how many letters he has sent to Paula and Eustochium, because he writes to them daily. 42 On Marcella's life, see Jerome, Ep. 127. The letters of Jerome addressed to her are numbers 23-29, 32, 34, 37, 38, 40-44, 59; letter 46 to Marcella also appears to be written by Jerome, not by Paula and Eustochium. Of Jerome's 40 letters to women, 24 were written before he left Rome.

When an Origenist tried to trick Paula with hard questions about the resurrection of the body, she calmly turned the questioner over to Jerome, who (by his own account) gave the imposter a verbal drubbing.48 And Marcella engaged in public debate against Origenist sympathizers in Rome, a performance Jerome scarcely would have lauded had it not been in an antiheretical cause.49 Augustine's circumstances, by contrast, appear quite different. None of the women with whom he was to carry on a correspondence in his mature life was known to him before he became a bishop; in fact, most of them appeared on his horizon a decade or more after he was raised to the episcopate.50 They sought him out; he did not, for the most part, seek them. In addition, Augustine became embroiled in ecclesiastical and theological disputes with these women; Jerome and Chrysostom, for their part, had not faced such problems with female friends. These differences, I think, shed some light on the cool tone of Augustine's letters to women. The first extant dated letter of Augustine to a woman in her own right Italica-was written in 408 A.D., twelve years after he had become a bishop. From Augustine's two letters to Italica, we learn that she had been recently widowed and that she lived in Rome. When her husband died, she wrote to Augustine for consolation. In his reply, Augustine instructs her on how Christians will "see" God-a discussion pertaining to God's incorporeality that had arisen in the Origenist controversy a few years earlier. Italica also wrote to Augustine concerning a house situated next to Augustine's church in Hippo Regius over which some problem, unclear from the correspondence, 47 Jerome, Epp. 38-39 (CSEL 54.289-308). 48 Jerome, Ep. 108.23 (CSEL 55.339-41). 49 Jerome, Ep. 127.9-10 (CSEL 56.152-53). 5 The first datable letters from Augustine containing a female addressee are those to Paulinus of Nola and his wife Therasia in the middle and late 390s. The content of these letters makes clear that they are meant for Paulinus, not for Therasia. See Augustine, Epp. 31, 42, 45, 80, 95; Epp, 149 and 186 are to Paulinus alone. For the complex matter of Paulinus and Augustine's correspondence, see Pierre Fabre, Essai sur la chronologie l'oeuvre de Saint Paulin de Nole. Publications de la faculty des lettres de l'Universit6 de Strasbourg, fasc. 109 (Paris: 'Les Belles Lettres', 1948), and his Saint Paulin de Nole et l'amitie chretienne. Bibliotheque des ecoles francaises d'Athenes et de Rome 167 (Paris: E. de Boccard, 1949). Peter Brown has suggested (in private correspondence of 10/11/88) that the relative ages of Jerome and Augustine in the 380s may help account for Jerome's willingness (and Augustine's unwillingness) to nurture friendships with women. (For the argument that Jerome was born in 331, see Kelly, 1, 337-39). Chrysostom, like Augustine, was already a bishop when he acquired his well-known women friends.</page><page sequence="14">38 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion had arisen. Whatever the precise issue, it appears that Italica had intervened on Augustine's behalf regarding the disputed property.51 Although we know little about Italica, we are fortunate to have a letter addressed to her by John Chrysostom just a few years before Augustine's. Chrysostom, like Augustine, was a stranger to Italica, yet his letter differs greatly in tone. He first repeats Paul's praise of women contained in the letter the apostle wrote to Christians living in Italica's city (Rome). According to Chrysostom, Paul's words illustrate how in divine combats, women can show themselves even more courageous than men. Like those strong women of yore, Italica is praised for her Christian commitment. She is lauded for having worked to end the tribulations that Chrysostom says have desolated the churches of the East-probably a reference to Italica's efforts to ensure that Chrysostom's representatives, hastening from Constantinople to Inno cent I in Rome, would receive a sympathetic hearing for his case. Christians like herself, who do not flinch before peril and sacrifice in order to restore peace, will receive a magnificent reward, Chrysostom assures her.52 When Augustine writes to Italica, however, the tone cools. In his first letter to her, dated to 408 (the letter of consolation upon her husband's death), Augustine warns Italica not to grieve as do the heathen who have no hope; rather, she should remember that she will meet her spouse in heaven. Reminding Italica that, in any case, she didn't know her husband as well as he knew himself, Augustine launches into a lengthy theological discourse about what it means to "see" God.53 In his second preserved letter to Italica, regarding the mysterious mat ter of the house, he delivers a thinly veiled reproof for not having informed him about the situation. He would prefer to know what had transpired, even if the report was disturbing: better to "weep with those that weep" than remain ignorant, he asserts. In these epistles, his first preserved letters addressed to a woman, Augustine expresses none of the affection and admira tion that mark Jerome's and Chrysostom's letters to women.54 Moreover, Augustine's approach did not change significantly even when he wrote to women he did know; At the beginning of the second decade of 51 Augustine, Epp. 92.1-2; 99.1; 92.3-6 (CSEL 34.436-38, 533, 438-44).

Augustine's budding friendships, however, soon disintegrated in a cloud of suspicion. The stories of his failed relations with these women command our attention and our interest. The first known incident that involved Augustine the bishop with aristo cratic women concerned Melania the Younger and her mother Albina. Al bina, a member of the Ceionii Rufii and daughter of a Roman prefect,5 was the sister of Volusianus, whose pagan skepticism provided Augustine with a notable opportunity-unsuccessfully realized-to win a highly placed pagan for the Christian faith.57 Albina, her daughter Melania the Younger, and Pinianus, Melania's husband (with whom she had already taken a vow of chastity) had like other aristocrats fled from Rome at the time of the Gothic invasion. Arriving at their North African estates, they sold some of their property in Numidia, Mauretania, and Africa Proconsularis, donating the proceeds to Christian charity. They then settled on their estate near 55 I have found no convincing evidence that Augustine knew any aristocratic women in Rome; according to Confessiones 5.9-13, his Roman friends were Manicheans. Augustine himself testifies that he knew the Anician women first by letter (Ep. 188.1.1 [CSEL 57.119]). Since Italica had young children when she and Augustine corresponded in 408 9, it is rather unlikely that Augustine knew her twenty years earlier in Italy. (On the early age of childbearing for Roman aristocratic women, see Keith Hopkins, "The Age of Roman Girls at Marriage," Population Studies 18 [1965]: 309-27). The editors of The Prosopogra phy of the Later Roman Empire, 2 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971, 1980), 1.465-66; 2.634, suggest she was perhaps the mother of the Anicia Italica whose name appears on a lead pipe from Ostia. Since Augustine writes in both extant letters to Italica that he "greets again" (resaluto) her sons (Epp. 92.4; 99.3 [CSEL 34.444, 535]), he perhaps had earlier correspondence with her. The identity of Hermogenianus, the ad dressee of Augustine's first letter, dating from 386, is also in doubt. Since Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius was probably too young, in 386, to have read Augustine's Contra academicos (see Claudian's In consulatum Olybrii et Probini), the remaining aristocratic candidates are Claudius Hermogenianus Caesarius, praefectus urbis Romae in 374, who was a pagan, and Q. Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius, praetorian prefect of the East in 378 and consul in 379, who was a Christian, and the father of Augustine's correspondent Anicia Faltonia Proba (see PLRE 1.171-72, 640-42 for the textual and inscriptional evidence). However, Augustine's breezy tone in Ep. 1, lacking any sign of deference to his addressee, makes it more likely that Hermogenianus was someone closer to his own age and situation than men who held the ranks noted above in the 370s. Moreover, I am reminded by Alan Cameron that Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius was known as "Olybrius," not "Hermogenianus" (private correspondence of 7/12/87; see Cameron's "Polyonomy in the Late Roman Aristocracy: The Case of Petronius Probus," Journal of Roman Studies 75 [1985]: 164-82, esp. 173-75). 6 See stemma of the Ceionii Rufii in PLRE 1.1138; also 1.33. 57 See Augustine's Epistles 135-38 for the discussion; also see Andre Chastagnol, "Le Senateur Volusien et la conversion d'une famille de l'aristocratie romaine au Bas-Empire," Revue des Etudes Anciennes 58 (1956): 241-53. For his ultimate conversion by his niece, Melania the Younger, see Vita Melania Junioris 53-55 (SC 90.230-38).</page><page sequence="16">40 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Thagaste, Augustine's birthplace. When they inquired of Augustine, his old friend bishop Alypius of Thagaste, and bishop Aurelius of Carthage how best to use the money derived from the liquidations, they were advised to found and endow monasteries. They donated so extensively to the impoverished town of Thagaste that its bishop, Alypius, became the envy of other African bishops, according to Melania's biography.58 Their very generosity was undoubtedly the factor that prompted the unpleasant scene described in Augustine's correspondence. The people of Hippo Regius, Augustine's see, clamored for Pinian's ordination to the priest hood, no doubt imagining that their municipality might, like Thagaste, be enriched through his munificence. Pinian, who had shown scarcely any calling to the spiritual life to begin with, let alone to the priesthood, was thoroughly frightened by the event and vowed, in a moment of desperate compromise, that he would consider Hippo his home if he were not pressed into the priesthood.59 Augustine's letters on this affair (epistles 125 and 126) cast unfavorable light on all the parties involved. Although Pinian was most likely guilty of some dissimulation in offering his vow to live in Hippo, Augustine appears in an even worse light: He was suspected by both Albina and Melania the Younger of having less-than-spiritual motives at heart. Albina hinted that it was not only the people of Hippo, but also their bishop, who had interest in the wealth that might come to them if Pinian became their priest. Augustine attempts to counter the suspicion-regarding both his flock and himself-by testifying that when he gave his own patrimony, "a few small fields," to the church at his birthplace of Thagaste, his congregation at Hippo Regius did not envy the donation but admired Augustine all the more for his "disin terest" in money matters. Likewise, he argues, the people of Hippo love Pinian for his spiritual virtues, not for the financial rewards he might bring to their town. In these letters, Augustine veers between not wanting to believe that Albina had made such insinuations about his motives, and attempting to clear himself from her charges. But Albina was not the only offended party: Melania the Younger was annoyed as well. We are told that she resented Augustine's eagerness to have Pinian swear an oath that he would regard Hippo as his home. When Melania objected to Augustine's volunteering himself as a witness to a written statement of Pinian's hastily offered vow, the bishop only reluctantly left off his testifying signature.60 In this case, it 58 Gerontius, Vita Melania Junioris 6; 20; 21 (SC 90.136, 168, 170); Augustine, Con fessiones 2.3.5; 4.7.12 (CCL 27.19, 46); Gerontius, Vita Melania Junioris 20; 21 (SC 90.168, 170, 172). 59 Gerontius, Vita MelaniaJunioris 1; 4; 8; 9 (SC 90.132, 140, 142, 144).

This inauspicious beginning of Augustine's relationship with Albina and her family was clouded even further by the family's support of and association with alleged heretics: in the past, with Origenists (through Melania the Younger's paternal grandmother, Melania the Elder and her monastic com panion, Rufinus, in Jerusalem),61 and in the present with Pelagians. Indeed, in the event concerning Pinian's near-ordination, the emissary between Pinian and Augustine was Pinian's good friend, Timasius, an acknowledged disciple of Pelagius.62 Peter Brown has suggested that Augustine's reluctance to attack Pelagius outright by name before 415 had to do with the presence of this highly placed group of Pelagian sympathizers in North Africa during these years.63 And when they resettled in Palestine, Albina, Melania the Younger, and Pinian met with Pelagius himself in 418; after the meeting they wrote to Augustine that, in their presence, Pelagius had abjured "Pelagian" opinions. Augustine replied that their attempt to rehabilitate Pelagius was not satisfactory, and composed for the trio his treatise On the Grace of Christ and Original Sin.64 Although they sent respectful greetings to Augustine via Jerome in 419,65 there is no further correspondence between them. Thus both monetary and theological difficulties appear to have soured the incip ient friendship between Augustine and Albina's family. A second circle of aristocratic women whom Augustine came to know in North Africa, whence they had fled Alaric's attack on Rome, were the women of the gens Anicia: Anicia Faltonia Proba, widow of the powerful plutocrat Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus; her daughter-in-law, Anicia Juliana, the recent widow of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius, and Juliana's daughter, Demetrias, who achieved much fame in Christian circles when, in 413, she renounced her impending marriage and took a vow of lifelong virginity.66 The early correspondence between Augustine and the Anician women por tended a warm future relationship: They too, would have been fitting coun terparts to the aristocratic women of Jerome's and John Chrysostom's circles. The first letter of Augustine to the Anician women is addressed to Proba, the grandmother, and dates to 412. Proba had asked Augustine to compose a 61 See Elizabeth Clark, The Life of Melania the Younger: Introduction, Translation, and Commentary, Studies in Women and Religion 14 (New York/Toronto: Edwin Mellen Press, 1984), 141-43, for a discussion of the Origenist connections. 62 Augustine, Ep. 126.6 (CSEL 44.12). 63 Peter Brown, "The Patrons of Pelagius," Journal of Theological Studies, n.s. 21 (1970): 65 (reprinted in Brown's Religion and Society in the Age of Augustine [London: Faber and Faber, 1972], 217-18). 64 Augustine, De gratia Christi 1.1-2 (PL 44.359-31). 65 Jerome, Ep. 143.2 (CSEL 56.293). 66 See Jones et al., eds., PLRE 1.732-33 (Proba); 468 (Juliana); Martindale, ed.

Augustine complies in letter 130, which begins with a pointed discussion of how the rich can be 'saved, although the difficulties of it are attested by Jesus' words about camels passing through eyes of needles. Augustine next warns Proba about the practical vexations that riches bring to their owners. How much better it is to be free from their burden! He reminds her that holy men in the past took the "precaution" of donating their wealth to the poor. However, if Proba cannot do this because she still has family obligations, Augustine concedes that she herself knows what account she can give to God of her use of riches-a sentiment that could have been either comforting or unsettling to his aristocratic addressee.67 Only after this lengthy preface regarding the dangers that wealth poses does Augustine get down to his ostensible topic, prayer. Proba, it appears, was not herself lacking in philosophical reflectiveness. She replied to Augustine that the human soul, while it abides in the body, is all too easily pulled down to earthly affairs. Augustine responds with advice on how we should bear both the pleasures and the evils of life with equa nimity, and concludes by thanking Proba for her "most pious care for my welfare."68 So far, so good, between Augustine and the Anician women. In 413, with Demetrias's vow of virginity, Augustine has yet another opportunity to praise the nobility and the religious conviction of this trio. His letter 150, expressing joy at the event, rises to an unusual peak of flowery rhetoric, nearly rivalling Jerome's shameless flattery of Demetrias on the same occasion.69 We gather from a later letter to Juliana that Augustine had visited the Anician household shortly before Demetrias's vow; he suggests that his exhortation to her may have been a decisive factor in her ascetic renunciation. 70 Another literary offering of Augustine to the Anician women was his treatise On the Good of Widowhood. Written probably in 414 for the wid owed Juliana, the treatise explains how polygamy and remarriage were appropriate and in accord with God's plan for men of the "Old Covenant," but not for Christians. Augustine praises Juliana's resolve to embrace Chris tian widowhood, but expresses the Church's preference for lifelong virginity, a course on which Juliana's daughter Demetrias had embarked. Perhaps Demetrias's virginity can compensate for her mother's loss of it, Augustine suggests. Indeed, he remarks, Demetrias already has a copy of his book On Holy Virginity, composed thirteen years earlier as a companion piece to On the Good of Marriage.7' By 414, however, the problem that was to cloud forever Augustine's 67 Augustine, Ep. 130.1.2; 130.2.3; 130.3.8 (CSEL 44.41-42, 42-43, 49). 68 Augustine, Ep. 131 (CSEL 44.77-79). 9 Augustine, Ep. 150; cf.

In Augustine's treatise for Juliana on widowhood, Pelagius is not referred to by name, but the addressee is warned against men whose discourses against grace are labelled "insidious," who lead Christians to imagine that prayer is superfluous. Echoing his famous line in Confessions book 10 that allegedly gave Pelagius pause years earlier,72 Augustine writes to Juliana that "we should rather beg God to give us what he commands us to have," and applies these words to the chastity practiced in respective ways by both the married and the celibate.73 The last letter of Augustine to the Anician women (Epistle 188, com posed in 415) shows him distressed at Pelagius's relationship with the family. Writing to Juliana, Augustine turns immediately from Demetrias's virginal vow to his earlier warning to Juliana not to heed men whose opinions are opposed to the grace of God. In the interim, Juliana had apparently assured Augustine that he need have no hesitations about her family's religious correctness: We have always been completely orthodox and have never suffered even a hint of heresy, "not even small errors," she had asserted. Her confident reply served only to alarm Augustine more, since he had by then learned that Pelagius had sent Demetrias a book that emphasized human self-sufficiency rather than God's grace, at least as Augustine understood the meaning of grace. In his letter to Juliana, Augustine equivocates on whether he does or does not know the author of the work: He begins by asking Juliana if they know the author, but concludes by affirming that it is Pelagius.74 He quotes a passage from Pelagius's treatise to Demetrias in which the young virgin is encouraged to believe that her spiritual riches were her own achievement. Worse yet, Augustine had discovered that it was the mother of the virgin (that is, Juliana herself) who had requested its author to compose this treatise for her daughter. Augustine argues that Demetrias, in all events, must be dissuaded from the views that the book's author professes.75 Au gustine's own letter to Juliana, by contrast, becomes a minitreatise on grace. Augustine's letter of 416 to Juliana is the last recorded correspondence between him and the Anician women. Any expectation that their friendship might continue through the years had, apparently, been doomed by their support for Augustine's theological enemy. Despite his powerful theological mind, Augustine had not been able to win aristocratic women to a firm support of orthodoxy, as he defined it. His lack of success compares unfavora bly to Jerome's triumphant enlistment of his women friends in the anti Origenist campaign, and to Chrysostom's ability to attract wealthy women 72 Augustine, Confessiones 10.37.60 (CCL 27.188; the evidence for Pelagius's discom fiture is given in Augustine De dono preseverantiae 20.53 (PL 45.1026). 73 Augustine, De bono viduitatis 17.21 (CSEL 41.329). 74 Augustine, Ep. 188.1.3, 2.4, 3.14 (CSEL 57.121, 122, 130). 75 Augustine, Ep. 188.2.4 (Augustine cites Pelagius's Ad Demetriadem 11 [PL 33.1107]), 3.14, 3.9 (CSEL 57.122, 130, 127).</page><page sequence="20">44 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion (not only Italica, but also two of the Anician women, Proba and Juliana) to support his cause in Rome.76 If this is the unhappy end of Augustine's relations with celibate women aristocrats, his advice to the married suggests that he upheld traditional views of wifely submission-views somewhat at odds with the theory of "companionship" in marriage he expressed elsewhere. The contrast between Augustine's abstract theory and his practical advice is strikingly evident in several of his letters. Consider, for example, the letter Augustine wrote in 411 to a married couple, Armentarius and Paulina, who had taken a vow of Christian con tinence, but were hard-pressed to keep it. The letter's theme and motifs are economic: Pay what you owe to the Great Creditor in the heavens, who though kindly is also firm. There could be, Augustine asserts, only one reason for the couple not to honor their debt to God: if Paulina, the wife, were too weak in mind to carry out their high resolve. But since Augustine has heard that she is ready to uphold the agreement, he urges them to carry out the plan. Here, however, Augustine switches his argument, a switch that allows the attentive reader to understand what actually had transpired: All that prevents Paulina from carrying out their vow is her obligation to pay Armentarius the "marital debt." That is, although Augustine had raised as a theoretical issue the woman's possible inability to live apart from sexual relations-thus playing to the rhetoric of"woman as the weaker sex"-it is in actuality her wifely duty to provide sexual services to her husband that stands in the way of their ascetic resolve. Augustine here cites the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 7:4 on husband and wife having power over each other's bodies. In its original context, this verse constituted a sobering innovation in sexual morality for male converts, namely, that they must be monogamously faithful. By contrast, Augustine cites the verse to emphasize the "bond" of bodily obligation to which Christian women commit themselves in marriage. His argument is reminiscent of his earlier praise, in the Confessions, for his mother's meek acceptance of her marital bondage and her counsel to female friends that they should patiently accept the abuse accorded them by their husbands, since the marriage contract had put them in a state of submis sion.77 The theme of wifely submission is carried to a dramatic conclusion in Augustine's undated epistle 262 to Ecdicia. Ecdicia and her husband had made a vow of continence that the husband had been unable to keep. Augustine blames Ecdicia for rushing her husband into a promise he was not ready to make and for her apparent unwillingness to resume sexual relations when he found himself unable to keep continent. The husband had fallen 76 John Chrysostom, Epp. 168-69 (PG 52.709), dated probably to 406 A.D. 77 Augustine, Ep. 127.1, 6, 9 (CSEL 44.19-20, 25-26, 28-29); cf. Confessiones 9.9.9 (CCL 27.145).</page><page sequence="21">Theory and Practice in Late Ancient Asceticism 45 into adultery for which Augustine blames Ecdicia. As a wife, she should have been subject to her husband in everything, especially, says Augustine, since they were both Christians: For Augustine, Christian commitment apparently implies a greater, not a lesser, degree of wifely submission. Augustine reminds Ecdicia that if she were the "weak" partner who needed sexual intercourse, her husband would have been obliged to give it-and how much more fitting it would have been for her to acquiesce to his needs, she "to whom subjection was more appropriate." After all, it was her husband who gave her "permission" to practice continence in the first place.78 Not only had Ecdicia erred in this sexual matter, she had taken Christian renunciation too seriously in other ways as well. Without asking her hus band's permission, she had given away her clothes, gold, silver, and money to "two unknown wandering monks." Once again, Ecdicia had failed to wait for her husband's agreement. Augustine reminds her that the married woman has no right to dispose of her own property; she belongs to her "head," as the New Testament tells us. Her husband was correct to insist that Christian couples may retain their possessions if they have a child who may require future support.79 Last, Ecdicia had further outraged her husband by refusing to wear appropriate clothes for a matron; she had adopted a shabby widow's garb. Augustine argues that even if Ecdicia's husband had forced her to bedeck herself with excessive ornaments (which he had not), she should have con sented to his request, wearing her "humble heart" underneath the "proud attire." Queen Esther is held up to Ecdicia as an example of a woman who knew how to influence a husband in religious directions by her appearance and by submissiveness.80 Augustine concludes his letter to Ecdicia by instructing her to write an apology to her angry husband, begging his forgiveness for the sin of giving away her property, and promising obedience to him in the future if he will once again practice continence.81 Nowhere else in Augustine's correspon dence are his views on the marriages of actual Christians revealed so nakedly-and so much in contrast to his depiction in book 14 of the City of God of that harmonious and loving companionship that would have con stituted the marrige of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.82 Augustine's theology of the Fall apparently reinforced his opinion that women, now in a state of subjection, could not expect the companionship of Eden to prevail in this sin-ridden world. His views of the ideal male-female relationship pos sible in Eden provide a dramatic contrast to his approach to actual married women, whom he holds responsible for their husband's failures to keep 78 Augustine, Ep. 262.1, 2, 3 (CSEL 57.621, 622-23, 623-24). 79 Augustine, Ep. 262.4, 5, 7, 8 (CSEL 57.624-25, 626-27). 80 Augustine, Ep. 262.9, 10 (CSEL 57.628-29). 81 Augustine, Ep. 262.11 (CSEL 57.630-31). 82 Augustine, De civitate Dei 14.26 (CCL 48.449-50).</page><page sequence="22">46 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion ascetic vows. His understanding of real-life marriage seems virtually un affected by his theological vision of companionate relationship. For all three men, the lack of correspondence between their theology of women and their actual associations with women prompts reflection on theology's failure to penetrate the socioeconomic order. As modern femi nists, we may be glad that Jerome's and Chrysostom's misogynist theologies left untouched their relationships with female aristocrats, whereas in the case of Augustine, we might rather wish that his vision of the ideal male female relationship had more fully informed his actual dealings with women. One point, however, these theologians share in common: Far from attempt ing to change the experience of marriage for Christian women, all three dwell on the restrictions, humiliations, and trials that are the matron's lot, whether these are expressed "in theory" (by Jerome and Chrysostom) or are acknowl edged "in practice" (by Augustine). That Augustine for his own reasons chose to modify the harsh rhetoric of his predecessors does not mean that he, any more than they, challenged male dominance and female submission within actual marriage. The final "moral" of this account is that, yet again, we must register the slowness of Christianity to challenge the traditional structure of marriage.
