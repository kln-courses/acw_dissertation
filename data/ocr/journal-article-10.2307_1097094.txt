<plain_text><page sequence="1">Specific Performance - Exploring the Roots of 'Settled Practice' Andrew Phang* The recent House of Lords decision in Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores (Holdings) Ltd' is destined to become a landmark in the law relating to specific performance. At first blush, however, it might have been thought that it was the Court of Appeal decision2 that merited this description instead, the court * Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore. 1 [1997] 2 WLR 898. 2 See [1996] Ch 286. Indeed, this particular case has been described, in a leading text, as a 'radical and controversial decision': see Gareth Jones &amp; William Goodhart, Specific Performance (London: Butterworths, 2nd ed, 1996) 51. C The Modern Law Review Limited 1998 421</page><page sequence="2">The Modern Law Review [Vol. 61 there having granted (albeit by a majority-) specific performance compelling the defendant to carry on a business in the context of a long-term lease. The House, however, reversed this decision, reiterating and reinforcing the 'settled practice'4 to the effect that orders requiring a contracting party to run a business would not generally be made." At one level, the significance of Argyll lies in the meticulous care with which Lord Hoffmann (who delivered the sole substantive judgment with which the other Law Lords agreed) examined the rationale undergirding the 'settled practice'. Argyll also raises issues as to the interrelationships amongst the factors that shape the discretion as to whether or not to grant specific performance. At another level, the case stands out as one of the rare occasions when jurisprudential concepts are openly canvassed and applied in a practical context, thereby6 emphasising the neglected importance of the conceptual underpinnings of the law. The facts and decision The defendant tenant entered into a 35 year lease with the plaintiff landlord for the largest shop in a shopping centre. The defendant in fact owned a chain of supermarkets, of which the premises concerned housed one (this particular supermarket being the anchor tenant in a shopping centre comprising approximately 25 shops). Because of fierce competition, however, the defendant decided to close down its loss-making or less profitable supermarkets. The supermarket on the demised premises was in fact a loss-making one and the defendant decided to close it, giving the plaintiff only about a month's notice to that effect; the lease itself had another 19 years to run. Such a course of action was, however, in clear breach of a covenant in the tenancy agreement which enjoined the defendant '[t]o keep the demised premises open for retail trade during the usual hours of business in the locality and the display windows properly dressed in a suitable manner in keeping with a good class parade of shops'. The plaintiff then attempted to persuade the defendant to continue trading until a suitable assignee had been located in return for a temporary rent concession. The defendant furnished no response7 and, instead, stripped the shop and closed it as originally scheduled. The plaintiff then commenced the present action claiming specific performance of the covenant just mentioned as well as damages.8 It should be noted that the lease was in fact ultimately assigned with the plaintiffs consent, so that the specific significance of the appeal before the House was about costs. The broader significance of the decision, however, is obvious. The House of Lords held in favour of the defendant and, as already mentioned, reversed the Court of Appeal's decision to grant the plaintiff specific performance of the said covenant. 3 Millett LJ dissenting. 4 n 1 above, 902. 5 And see Attorney-General v Colchester Corporation [ 1955] 2 QB 207, 217, per Lord Goddard CJ - the very first authority cited by the House in the instant case. 6 See eg M.D.A.

Lord Hoffmann also pointed out that while specific performance is traditionally regarded as an exceptional remedy under English law, the reverse was the case with respect to civil law systems.12 However, he then proceeded to observe that '[i]n practice' there was a less substantive difference; the relevant principles applicable in the English context were 'reasonably well settled and depend upon a number of considerations, mostly of a practical nature, which are of very general application' and whilst he had 'made no investigation of civilian systems', he would 'a priori ... expect that judges [in these systems] take much the same matters into account in deciding whether specific performance would be inappropriate in a particular case'. ' This emphasis on comparative law is to be welcomed,'4 and it is perhaps not inappropriate to observe that Lord Goff (although he did not sit on this appeal) emphasised the increasing importance of comparative law in an extrajudicial lecture a decade ago.'5 Turning to the main reasons traditionally prayed in aid of the 'settled practice', Lord Hoffmann began by pointing out that this practice was 'not entirely dependent upon damages being an adequate remedy'.16 He focused, instead, on the element of constant supervision by the court, a concept so well-entrenched as part of textbook law, that it is seldom analysed and, instead, is often repeated almost as a ritual incantation. What constant supervision did not mean, Lord Hoffmann remarked, was literal supervision by the court itself. However, the party enjoined to perform would be liable for contempt if it persisted in disobeying the court order.'7 But, as 9 n I above, 902. 10 ibid (emphasis added).

O The Modern Law Review Limited 1998 423</page><page sequence="4">The Modern Law Review [Vol. 61 Lord Hoffmann quite pertinently pointed out, this 'does not really meet the point'.'8 The crux of the problem lay, rather, in the fact that the court might have to give 'an indefinite series' of rulings to enforce the said order whenever there was a breach and a consequent application by the party aggrieved and it was this 'which has been regarded as undesirable'.19 That was not, however, the end of the matter, for his Lordship then proceeded to elaborate upon the reasons why the possibility of such repeated rulings was undesirable. And it was at this point that the issue of contempt (mentioned earlier) finally became directly relevant: as 'the only means available to the court to enforce its order',20 punishment for contempt, was nevertheless 'a powerful weapon: so powerful, in fact, as often to be unsuitable as an instrument for adjudicating upon the disputes which may arise over whether a business is being run in accordance with the terms of the court's order'.2 The consequences were dire and undesirable: quite apart from damaging the defendant's commercial reputation, it would literally coerce that party to run its business in a certain manner when it had in fact decided that it was not in its economic interest to run the business at all; in addition, enforcement (particularly in the context of repeated applications over a period of time) was 'likely to be expensive in terms of cost to the parties and the resources of the judicial system'.22 The focus, interestingly, was not only on the individual freedom of the party but also on the more utilitarian consideration of non-wastage of resources as well.23 There were, however, obstacles to the 'settled practice': principally in the form of a rather formidable number of relatively recent precedents that appeared to suggest that the rubric of constant supervision should either be severely limited or even done away with altogether. In, arguably, the most influential of these precedents, the focus lay not so much in the basic ratio decidendi of the case itself, but, rather, in the (more specific) observation by Lord Wilberforce in Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding 24 to the effect that '[w]here it is necessary, and, in my opinion, right, to move away from some 19th century authorities, is to reject as a reason against granting relief, the impossibility for the courts to supervise the doing of work'.25 Indeed, this observation has been repeatedly cited, most notably, by Sir Robert Megarry V-C, who took it as having done away with the rationale of constant supervision altogether.26 Subsequent opinions (although sympathetic towards this tack and thus advocating flexibility) were nevertheless more tentative,27 not least because of the equally formidable array of authorities that endorsed the concept of constant supervision instead.28 Indeed, in the 18 nl above, 903. 19 ibid. 20 ibid. 21 ibid 904. 22 See generally ibid (emphasis added).

A case oft-cited in this regard is the Court of Appeal decision of Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of Wolverhampton v Emmons3' which involved a building contract. A close perusal of the case, however, will reveal that the focus of the court was, in the main,32 on another factor, viz, the need for definiteness in the terms of the contract.33 And it has been argued that the case itself should be interpreted as a clear repudiation of the constant supervision requirement.34 Yet another case (also frequently cited) concerns a more recent decision: that of Sir John Pennycuick V-C in Jeune v Queens Cross Properties Ltd,35 where specific performance was granted in respect of a landlord's covenant to repair. Interestingly, both cases were distinguished by Lord Hoffmann, who classified both, despite their seemingly divergent subject-matter, as instances involving orders requiring the defendants concerned 'to achieve a result', as opposed to orders requiring the defendants 'to carry on activities', including 'running a business over a more or less extended period of time' (which was in fact the situation in the present case). In his Lordship's view, '[t]he possibility of repeated applications for rulings on compliance with the order which arises in the [latter] case does not exist to anything like the same extent in the [former]';37 he proceeded to add that '[e]ven if the achievement of a result is a complicated matter which will take some time, the court, if called upon to rule, only has to examine the finished work and say whether it complies with the order'.38 It is submitted that while the distinction is persuasive, there is the danger of infinite regress, for even in an ostensibly one-off situation, say, that of repairs, it is still possible for the court to be subjected to repeated applications if the defendant is extremely recalcitrant; in point of fact, every situation necessarily involves a process of sorts, although it is admitted that the conduct of a business is a far clearer example and constitutes a situation where the danger of repeated applications to the court is even more probable. It is also pertinent to note that Lord Hoffmann was much influenced by the broad practical considerations embodied within the observations of Slade J in Braddon 29 See generally n I above, 905-906. 30 See A.S.

What if the party concerned were nevertheless recalcitrant? It has been argued that 'the prospects of repetition, although an important consideration, ought not to be allowed to negative a right'.43 And this raises the related issue of having to balance the applicant's right to performance against the harsh punishment that will be inflicted upon the defendant. It should also be noted that where a company is concerned (as in the instant case), committal for contempt cannot be directed at the company as such but can, at best, be only directed at the officers of the company.44 But this point would not of course apply in situations where individuals were committed for contempt. One further point may be made, and addresses the issue of wastage of resources: as Professor Treitel argues, it may be possible for the court to appoint an expert as its officer in order to supervise performance of a recalcitrant defendant or, alternatively, the court could empower the applicant to appoint a person to act as agent of the defendant who then supervises the latter in ensuring enforcement of the order.45 In the light of the arguments militating against the 'settled practice', it is suggested that it might be better for the courts to allow for the possibility of decreeing specific performance even if it involves a continuous process (such as the running of a business) as opposed to the obtaining of a fixed result. In any event, it is submitted that the concept of constant supervision ought not to be a conclusive factor in the decision of the court as to whether or not to grant specific performance.46 Consistent with this suggestion, it is also highly significant to note that Lord Hoffmann himself was prepared to allow the courts to depart from the 'settled practice' in 'exceptional circumstances';47 thus: 39 [1987] 1 EGLR 209, 213. 40 See n 1 above, 902 and 907. 41 See generally Jones &amp; Goodhart, n 2 above, 53-54. 42 See CH Giles &amp; Co Ltd v Morris [1972] 1 WLR 307, 318, per Megarry J.

If this be the case, then, of course, the various limitations on specific performance (such as constant supervision) diminish greatly (or even wholly) in importance. There is, of course, no clear answer to what has become an interesting debate,49 although it is suggested that it is unlikely (under English law at least) that such a radical change will occur. Less radically, a suggestion that a strong (albeit rebuttable) presumption in favour of awarding damages on a cost-of-restoration basis be considered instead may merit serious attention.50 But, once again, this particular measure of damages may not find much favour in the English context, particularly after the recent House of Lords decision in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth."5 Linkages Argyll also prompts questions as to what possible linkages there might be amongst the various general factors traditionally utilised to ascertain whether or not specific performance ought, on balance, to be granted.52 Whilst adequacy of damages as a factor was mentioned, the focus of Lord Hoffmann's judgment was upon the factor pertaining to constant supervision by the court. Indeed, his Lordship clearly indicated that these two factors were separate and distinct.53 Lord Hoffmann not only referred to the requirement of constant supervision by the court but also to the need for the presence of yet another factor, viz, the definite nature of the terms of the contract itself (and, hence, clarity and precision of the court's order).54 Indeed, it should be noted that Lord Hoffmann also decided that the obligation in the instant case was, in any event, too imprecise to be enforced.55 On a related note, the literal language as well as tenor of the judgment suggest that both these last-mentioned factors (ie, constant supervision of the court and definiteness in the contractual terms) are separate and independent - a suggestion that finds support not only in the discussion in the textbooks but also in case-law as 48 ibid 909. 49 cf eg Schwartz, n 42 above, on the one hand, with Anthony T. Kronman, 'Specific Performance' (1978) 45 U Chicago L Rev 351 and (especially) Edward Yorio, 'In Defense of Money Damages for Breach of Contract' (1982) 82 Columbia L Rev 1365, on the other (indeed, it may be apposite to point to some affinity between some of the argumentation in the lastmentioned article and the reasoning of the House in Argyll: see Yorio, esp at 1404). Reference may also be made to Sharpe, n 45 above. It is interesting to note that, in Scotland, specific performance (ie specific implement) is available as a legal right, a situation quite different from that which exists under English law: see Retail Parks Investments Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland plc [1996] SCLR 652, 669, per Lord Cullen (Court of Session, Inner House). 50 See generally Yorio, n 49 above, 1402-1404. 51 [1994] 1 WLR 650; and see Andrew Phang, 'Subjectivity, Objectivity and Policy - Contractual Damages in the House of Lords' [1996] JBL 362 and Jill Poole, 'Damages for Breach of Contract - Compensation and "Personal Preferences": Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth' (1996) 59 MLR 272. 52 See generally Jones &amp; Goodhart, n 2 above, ch 2 for a succinct, yet highly informative, general account. 53 See the main text accompanying n 18, above. 54 See n 1 above, 904-905.

Throughout Lord Hoffmann's judgment is also to be found constant reference to the idea of fairness. In reviewing the requirement of clarity, for example, his Lordship referred to the possible oppression to the defendant that might result if it were coerced into complying with imprecise obligations under the threat of committal for contempt in the event of disobedience.57 He was also of the view that to grant specific performance might cause injustice by possibly allowing the plaintiff to enrich himself at the defendant's expense.58 It should, however, be noted that Lord Hoffmann was more concerned, in the final analysis, with the 'public interest' :" a point to which we will return in the next part. One is, in fact, given the overall impression that there are various conceptions of fairness. His Lordship did, for example, also acknowledge that the defendant's conduct in the present case was less than desirable: a fact that weighed heavily with the judges at the Court of Appeal stage.6 Lord Hoffmann, however, was of the view that although the court would brook no egregious conduct,61 the parties in the present case were 'large sophisticated commercial organisations' who must have been aware of the 'settled practice' :62 'there was no element of personal breach of faith'.63 But this argument may be a double-edged sword, for could it not be equally argued that not to grant specific performance would result in unfairness to the applicant instead?64 As we have seen, Lord Hoffmann solved this problem by holding that the parties were of roughly equal bargaining power and sophistication. Returning to the issue of linkages, it is suggested that this reference to unfairness does in fact raise the issue of hardship,65 which is traditionally considered as a separate and independent factor. It could of course be argued that the sense in which 'hardship' is presently being utilised is much looser. This argument is indeed persuasive, except for the fact that the meaning of 'hardship' as a separate factor is in fact precisely as just described; there is, in other words, no precise meaning attributable to the concept, with the entire inquiry being one which is very much fact-dependent and (in, I suspect, mostly subconscious ways) dependent 56 See eg Greenhill v Isle of Wight (Newport Junction) Railway Company (1871) 23 LT 885, 887, per Malins V-C. And cf The South Wales Railway Company v Wythes (1854) 1 K &amp; J 186, 69 ER 429, which was decided on the factor of constant supervision, but was affirmed on appeal on the ground that the contractual terms were too vague (see (1854) 5 De G M &amp; G 880, 43 ER 1112). 57 n 1 above, 905. 58 ibid 906.

It is tentatively suggested that the factor of 'hardship' is traditionally classified separately in large part because it constitutes an avenue by which the court can introduce an element of compassion into the inquiry itself: an element that is not otherwise easily introduced.68 The importance and practicality of jurisprudence It bears repeating that it is but very rarely that a court decision not only raises but also affords explicitly the opportunity to discuss jurisprudential concepts. Argyll it is suggested, is one such occasion, for which teachers who try to inculcate in their students the value (yes, even practical value) of theory should be most grateful.69 I should, however, hasten to add that no definitive answers are given as such, but in highlighting, inter alia, the significance that theoretical concepts play in the process of judicial reasoning, Argyll does much to encourage jurisprudential debate. More specifically, Argyll is an excellent illustration of the continuing tension between individual rights on the one hand and utilitarian considerations on the other.70 This is a theoretically intractable conundrum and may well be so because each concept was developed at a separate and distinct historical point in time and may ultimately represent, on a theoretical level, incommensurable and irreconcilable concepts." But the reality of law in general and the common law in particular does not allow the judge the luxury of sitting on the fence. He or she deals with real life situations, for which a decision must be given, and which decision will necessarily impact on the lives of the litigants concerned. Argyll is an excellent illustration of the process of balancing as the court attempts to reconcile the tension mentioned above, and it manages, it is suggested, to do so by recourse to the specific factual matrix before it. This may, perhaps, explain why Lord Goff, for example, is at pains to point to the importance of facts in the context of actual adjudication72 and this case appears to lend support to the thesis (stated tentatively here) to the effect that the practical denouement of an intractable abstract dilemma may well be why, despite the continuous doubts expressed about the absence of objectivity,73 adjudication continues without any anxiety or loss of 66 See also generally the discussion in the next part. 67 See also eg Spry, n 65 above, 89-90 and Burrows, Remedies for Torts and Breach of Contract, n 30 above, 371. 68 See Andrew Phang, 'Positivism in the English Law of Contract' (1992) 55 MLR 102; cf also Braddon Towers Ltd v International Stores Ltd [1987] 1 EGLR 209, 212, per Slade J who expressed great reluctance at having to follow the 'settled practice'.

It is of course true that it is the jurist who aids in synthesising the law laid down by the judges, but it is suggested that judges do perform a philosophical function in the practical arena, albeit as Lord Goff himself puts it, according to 'the principle of gradualism'.75 In Argyll, it can be seen that Lord Hoffmann is all too aware of the theoretical conundrums - in particular, the conflict between individual rights and utilitarianism, as well as the conflict between individual rights themselves (here, belonging to the plaintiff and defendant, respectively). On the one hand, he acknowledges the moral argument that supports the plaintiff's application for specific performance, stating that '[t]he principles of equity have always had a strong ethical content and nothing which I say is intended to diminish the influence of moral values in their application'.76 In addition, there were general arguments from fairness that arose in the course of the case itself.77 On the other hand, Lord Hoffmann had earlier considered the rights of the defendant, in particular, possible unfair interference with its individual liberty via proceedings for contempt.78 And this illustrates that rights do not exist in a vacuum and that in any given situation, there will almost always be a conflict between two parties' rights. Which, then, is to prevail? If the answer is that it is all subjective, then the argument from rights is greatly diminished, even emasculated.79 Given Lord Hoffmann's references to wastage, however, can one argue that, although finding (in the final analysis) in favour of the defendant, he had, in effect, adopted a utilitarian approach?s80 If this be the case, then the defendant's rights would appear to have been generalised as well as merged into a broader utilitarian argument; and, given the final outcome of the case, it would appear, further, that it was this broader argument that prevailed, and the plaintiff's rights ignored as a result. One other interpretation, however, is that this remained a situation of conflicting individual rights, albeit settled via consequential arguments."8 But this approach also falls prey to many of the traditional arguments levelled against utilitarianism, for example, incom- mensurability and the dreaded argument of subjectivity. A yet further approach brings us back to the very tentative thesis proffered above, ie, that a factual approach may aid in the solution of abstract conundrums. By its very nature, however, no clear theoretical formula is available. In the present case, for example, Lord Hoffmann was not unaware of the moral arguments in favour of the plaintiff.82 However - and as we have seen - in the light of the specific factual context of the case itself (principally, the fact that both parties were 'large sophisticated commercial organisations' who could well look after themselves83), 74 See Lord Goff, n 72 above, 185-186. 75 See generally Lord Goff, n 15 above.

This is consistent with Lord Goff's 'principle of gradualism', which (as he terms it) is an 'essentially pragmatic approach', in which the injunction is to '[l]et facts develop principles: do not let principles, still less rules, be so dogmatically stated as to preclude a just decision on the facts'; and this, in his view, means that judges ought not to be over-ambitious and over-state the law.84 It is suggested that Lord Hoffmann's recognition of the one set of tensions in Argyll (between individual rights and utilitarian goals) is in fact mirrored in and (in many ways) unpacked in an extrajudicial context in his Upjohn Lecture85 - in particular, in his discussion of the reasonable man in the context of the law of negligence. He distinguishes the tension (not unlike that discussed above) between the attribution of responsibility on the basis of moral fault and the award of compensation by way of distribution of loss, the latter of which is 'a matter of social justice which does not require any moral fault at all'.86 And this gives rise to an 'ambiguity in the objects of the law'.87 Lord Hoffmann does not purport 'to debate the merits of these two different approaches to liability in negligence',88 which is thoroughly understandable in the light of the proposition proffered above to the effect that no (at least universal) solution to the tension is possible. The problem, in his view, however, is that 'the courts have never brought themselves to admit to the tension' and this has resulted in a blurring of the lines between the two objects.89 He then makes a very important point, as follows: I happen to believe that judges should always give the real reasons for their decisions. .. But I think it does the legal profession no good to wrap its reasoning in mystery and it would be better if we came clean.9 And, true to his advice, Lord Hoffmann does indeed clearly set out, in Argyll, the precise reasons for his decision. There was, in the instant case, however, a further set of tensions - between the parties' respective rights - that was, it has been suggested, handled via a factual resolution.91 Conclusion Argyll will become a landmark in the law relating to specific performance. Lord Hoffmann's meticulous and perceptive judgment has not only brought to the fore but has also illuminated many (oftimes latent) issues underlying the law in this 84 See generally Lord Goff, n 15 above, 87. 85 See Lord Hoffmann, 'Anthropomorphic Justice: The Reasonable Man and His Friends' (1995) 29 Law Teacher 127. 86 See Lord Hoffmann, ibid 130 (emphasis added).

His is also a judgment that very clearly demonstrates the judicial process in theoretical action. On a strictly doctrinal level, it is clear that the concept of constant supervision continues to constitute a major obstacle to the grant of specific performance in the context of continuous acts (such as the running of a business). Its contours as well as underlying foundations have nevertheless been thoroughly explored, clarified and even reshaped, but, consistent with the pragmatic cast of adjudication, the door has been left slightly ajar - to be firmly pushed open should the need arise.92 It is ironic (yet clearly praiseworthy) that such pragmatism recognises that, on occasion, moral criteria (by and large feared as 'messy'93) will both inform and infuse the judicial process in order that justice might prevail. 92 See the main text accompanying nn 47-48, above. 93 And see n 68 above.</page></plain_text>
