Placing man in the New West: Masculinities of The Last Picture Show Gray son Holmes1, Leo Zonn2 &amp; Altha J. Cravey1* 1 Department of Geography, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-3220, U.S.A. 2 Department of Geography, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712-1098, U.S.A. * Author for correspondence (E-mail: ajcravey@email.unc.edu) Key words: cinematic geographies, gender, masculinities, places of contestation, Old West-New West Abstract The Last Picture Show does not fall within the genre of the Western, yet the cinematic narrative mourns the loss of the iconic Westerner - a man - and the passing of his home places that constitute the Old West. This paper is concerned with the ways in which this man and his places are transformed along with the embryonic but inexorable emergence of the New West - and its attendant demand for recognition of hitherto unheard voices (e.g., women, Latinos) - that accompanied significant social, cultural and political shifts that were beginning to emerge within the country as a whole in the represented early 1950s. His represented sites of contestation are found within the frame of the small west Texas town of Anarene, created by Larry McMurtry's novel of the same name as the film, both of which reflect contexts of the era in which they were constructed - the mid 1960s to early 1970s. We suggest that the film shows a great sensitivity to the ways in which particular masculinities are constituted in specific places, to the tensions that arise from the changing nature and definitions of masculinity as they are linked to these places, and with his sense of nostalgia and loss that accompanies his inevitable decline. But there is no clear and empowered place for women in these new places, only a recontextualized form of a patriarchal order which is not relational and which still maintains essentialist assumptions of gender. The Old West has taken new shape, much to the chagrin of man, but it is hardly a New West, with its emerging and representative voices. Introduction Masculinity is salient in many cinematic genres, and notably so in the Western. After all, Westerns are not so much about the West as they are about the Westerner. He stands alone, heroic, powerful, and fighting to the end for justice and or- der. The Westerner is the 'Hast gentleman" and Westerns are "probably the last art form in which the concept of honor retains its strength" (Warshow 1992, p. 457). The Westerner of course, derives his masculine identity from a particular place and time: The Old West. The winds and rains and harsh natural environment of the American Frontier West are integral to his being and provide an ongoing test for his mettle. Damsels and innocents, likewise, give the West- erner ample opportunity to practice his values and enact his code of honor. He and his place in the world are so tightly enmeshed that they represent one singular ideal. The Last Picture Show is not a Western, per se, yet the cinematic narrative mourns the loss of the iconic Westerner as well as the passing of his home place, the Old West. In this paper, we explore the way place, masculinity, and this Westerner are entwined in this classic and highly-regarded film. We suggest that the film shows a great sensitivity to the ways in which particular masculinities are constituted in specific places, and thus how geographic and social change are intimately entangled. We also explore some of the ways place is used to highlight other themes in this film, such as the way broader US social transformations are caught up with altered gender and sexual relationships in the mid- twentieth century. In a highly effective move, the film lends a certain potency to place by representing places that exist inside of places that in turn, exist inside of other places, and in this way adding layers of meaning to infinitely em- bedded images. Aitken and Lukinbeal (1998) explored this kind of endless repetition of an idea/image in the film Inde- pendence Day and refer to such layered representations as mise-en-abyme, or fractal geographies.1 In The Last Picture Show, these fractal geographies include Sam the Lion (the Westerner who personifies the Old West), the Royal (movie) Theater, the dust blown Texas town of Anarene, the cine- matic imaginary, and the Old West itself. Such fragmentary and multifaceted representations allow the film, which falls in the genre of narrative about the decline of the small town in the US, to speak simultaneously about the decline of contemporary small towns and about the (Old) West. The study of masculinity concerns men and male sub- jectivities, but also addresses gender, both as a system and as a set of practices. The field of masculinity studied thus engages an animated and wide-ranging set of multidisciplin- ary concerns (Connell, 1995; Gardiner, 2002; Adams and Savrin, 2002). Masculinity research draws from, and fuels ideas in, feminist theory as well as anti-racist theory, sexu- ality studies, and post-structuralist ideas. The analysis of</page><page sequence="2">278 film and other media representations have been a particu- larly energetic field for masculinity research (see Lehman, 2001) and have inspired a number of papers by geograph- ers (Jackson, 1994; Aitken and Lukinbeal, 1998; Lukinbeal and Aitken, 1998; Jackson et al, 1999, 2000; Dahlman, 2002). Recently, in the discipline of geography, masculinity studies have moved beyond cultural and feminist frontiers and are expanding and beginning to influence many differ- ent (though certainly not all) disciplinary concerns. These include urban, economic, employment, illness, and post- colonial geographies, to name a few (Berg and Longhurst, forthcoming). Cinematic geography provides a unique opportunity to study the nature of American society because of its im- mediate concern with narratives of places that lie at the heart of societal practice, while at the same time the ca- pacity and influence of film to represent these geographies are inestimable. Cinema can reflect, create and perpetu- ate geographically-based narratives in a variety of forms whereby realities and their filmic representations become inextricably intertwined, and so myths, icons, symbols, and stories of the country's places blend in a continuum from the experienced to the screen. At the same time, cinema reaches a wide and receptive audience wherein these imaginaries are inseparable from society, its practices, and its people. It is no surprise, then, that cinematic geography is a significant research direction with a recent and robust history that cov- ers an array of places and narratives and a broad spectrum of philosophic perspectives, of which examples can be found in the readers by Aitken and Zonn (1994), Clarke (1997), and Creswell and Dixon (2002). The concern here is with the ways that a narrative of small town America, small-town Texas to be specific, is used as a metaphor within The Last Picture Show for national- scale social and geographic change. It is contended that the film does not causally link change within the town to America's changes, but instead uses the town's narrative to mirror and chronicle social and geographic shifts of the nation. In this way, the tales of a represented town are the tales of the country. Further, the nature of its specific con- cern with masculinities of the Old West provides a window on the gendered discourse of that mythology's broader nar- rative, which in turn recognizes the dynamics of changing masculinities in the country as a whole. We begin with a discussion of the film, its major char- acters, and central narrative. Next, we consider the film's central character - Sam the Lion - and compare him to masculine archetypes of the Old West. Then, we lay out some of the mid-twentieth century social and geographical changes that the film addresses, particularly the declining significance of American small towns, the disappearance of ranching and other cowboy occupations, and the eclipse of the Old West. Subsequently, we link these themes to the issue of place, place-identity, and masculinities and explore these connections by presenting examples from the film. The Last Picture Show The Last Picture Show was released during the fall of 1971 to considerable critical acclaim. Directed by Peter Bogdanovich and based on a book of the same title by Larry McMurtry (1966), who also co-wrote the screen- play (McMurtry and Bogdanovich, 1970), it garnered eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Director, and won two - Best Supporting Actress for Cloris Leachman and Best Supporting Actor for Ben Johnson. Shot in a stark black and white, The Last Picture Show depicts events in the small, withering, and dust-blown west Texas town of Anarene during the Korean War, a time that can be seen as the end of an era for the town and for American society as a whole. It is a tale of characters whose lives are as tired and austere as the town and yet it also is a story of slow but inexorable changes that mirror the transitions of the town, and thus country. Sonny Crawford and Duane Jackson are seniors and co- captains of a perpetually losing high school football team. They and their steady girlfriends often frequent the local movie theater, called the Royal Theater, which serves as an escape for the teenagers from the boring setting of Anarene and as a locale to 'neck'. Sonny decides in the middle of his senior year to stop going steady with Charlene, because he no longer finds their relationship interesting, and soon after begins an affair - his first - with Ruth Popper, the wife of the high school athletic coach. Meanwhile, Duane encoun- ters problems with his rich and self-centered girlfriend, Jacy Farrow, who, with the prodding of her mother, begins to long for a more urbane lifestyle than Duane provides, so she starts going to nude bathing parties at Bobby Sheen's house in Wichita Falls, a larger and richer town near Anarene. Sonny and Duane also frequent the local restaurant and pool hall, both of which, like the movie theater, are owned by Sam the Lion. Sam is an older man and the town's main link with its fading past. He serves as a father figure for Duane and Sonny, and is the genuine father of Billy, a mentally handicapped boy whose life revolves around sweeping the dusty main street of Anarene and staring entranced at the movies playing at the theater. Sonny is one of the few people in town who befriends Billy. Sonny and Duane decide to go on a weekend excursion to Mexico, and upon returning learn that Sam the Lion has died of a stroke. In his will, Sam leaves the pool hall to Sonny, the restaurant to Geneviève Morgan and the movie theater to Miss Mosey, the latter two of whom operated the respective places. Soon after, Sonny and Duane graduate from high school. Days later, Duane and Jacy finally con- summate their relationship in a hotel - the loss of virginity for both - whereupon she leaves Duane for the more urbane Bobby Sheen. Duane decides to leave Anarene to work in the oil fields. Meanwhile, Bobby jilts Jacy and marries someone else. As a response, Jacy allows herself to be seduced by Abilene, her mother's lover and father's oil foreman. Hat- ing this encounter and following a recommendation by her mother, she then decides to seduce Sonny away from Ruth Popper. Given that Sonny had always had a crush on her,</page><page sequence="3">he willingly accepts her advances and they begin a romance. Duane hears about this and comes back to Anarene to fight Sonny for Jacy, which leaves Sonny with a serious eye in- jury. Duane then decides to enlist in the army while Sonny is in the hospital. After Sonny is released from the hospital, he and Jacy decide to elope, but her parents find out and stop the marriage before the couple can spend one night together. Jacy's mother, Lois Farrow, volunteers to drive Sonny back to Anarene from the place where they found the couple. Along the way, Lois reveals to Sonny that she and Sam had once been lovers over twenty years ago. After a brief passage of time, Duane returns to Anarene for a short time before he is to be shipped out to Korea. He and Sonny reconcile with each other and decide to go to the movie theater on the night before Duane leaves, the same night before it closes down due to lack of customers. Sonny and Duane watch the movie, Red River, and then head off to talk throughout the night. The next morning, Duane leaves for Korea, but not before loaning Sonny his car while he is away. Just after Duane's bus pulls away, Sonny hears a loud screeching of car wheels and runs up the street to see the dead body of Billy splayed out on the road, hit by a truck. In the midst of some locals' complaining about what Billy was doing in the street, Sonny drags the boy's body away and covers it with his coat. Upset by the loss of one friend, the departure of another, and everything else that has been happening, he hops into his truck and starts driving away from Anarene. He does not get far, however, before turn- ing around and driving to Ruth Popper's house. She greets him with much yelling about the worthless state in which he left her. She soon calms down, though, and caresses the emotionally spent boy as the film ends. Sam the Lion and masculine archetypes of the Old West The Last Picture Show chronicles the end of the Old West, which is concomitant with the decline of the small, agrarian town and redefined gender identities and practices. Wide open spaces become a liability that constrains people and the values of the West. After the transition, these spaces and representations of the West no longer reflect promise, vigor, and unencumbered freedoms, with heroic men living in in- timate connection with the land doing larger-than-life deeds. Transformations in places and people in The Last Picture Show mark the end of the Western era for Anarene and for American society as whole, an era that is male-defined and oriented, and so the disintegration of the old order signals an end to an iconic unchanging Old West masculinity. The cowboy as seen and experienced by McMurtry, who was born in 1936 and was raised on a ranch near Archer City, lies at the heart of this construction of Old West masculinities in the book and film, and, in fact, he believes "the core of the Western Myth - that cowboys are brave and cowboys are free - is essentially unassail- able." (1999, p. 55) McMurtry sees the cowboy as ". . . a seminomadic figure who often owned nothing but a saddle, that gave rise to the stories, all the songs, and 279 many of the movies, when movies came. These aging ranchers, some of whose children were already well along in the process of losing the land they had worked so hard to acquire, had, at the end, as consolation for much loss and wastage, the knowledge that they had all, at least, been cowboys in their youth, men who had known the land was empty, a place of unpeopled horizons. .."(1999,22) What was left of the Old West in West Texas of 1 95 1 , as represented in The Last Picture Show, was, of course, a shell, a parody, an ironic form of the original cowboy landscapes and practices whose history went back generations before. The only remnants were ranching in a select few places (a cowboy practice clearly eclipsed in economic significance by oil) and motifs that harkened to the past, such as the rodeo, clothes, and music, and of course, stories told by a few aging men whose identities were somehow linked to the cowboy icon. But to McMurtry, "The tradition I sought to leave - the cowboy tradition - was not even two generations old. Slipping away from it was as easy as slipping through a loosely strung barbed-wire fence." (1999, p. 66) So, the early 1950s of The Last Picture Show represented a cowboy of the Old West mythology who was alive, but was dying a slow and inexorable death. The character of Sam the Lion best exemplifies the mas- culine ideal of the Old West. He is of a different, older generation than most of the other townsfolk, and thus is from the era closer to what is usually considered to be the pinnacle of the West. While he is not the town's only link with that time period, he is clearly the most emblematic. Throughout the film, Sam the Lion is an idealized figure who evokes classic Western archetypes (Slotkin, 1992). Accord- ing to Richard Slotkin (1992), the Western was preeminent "among mass-culture genres as a field for the making of public myths and for the symbolization of public ideology" (p. 278). During a thirty year reign of the genre, a positive view of America's past was deliberately promoted by strong masculine leading men - Westerners - who embodied the values of honor, self sacrifice and decency. Sam the Lion is both character and archetype in The Last Picture Show. His 'look', his unwavering defense of what is good and decent, and his quiet strength all suggest a recognizable archetype from the Western genre, that is "the fundamental or root structure of thought and imagination that shape American cultural mythology in all its forms" (Slotkin, 1992, p. 31 1). One incident in the film is particularly telling. Sam con- fronts Sonny and a group of high school boys who bring Billy home after an escapade involving a local prostitute. Barring them from the pool hall and the café he chastises them: "You didn't even have the decency to wash his face ". Near the end of The Last Picture Show, and after Sam's own death, the Royal Theater itself is forced to close. On the very last night, Sonny and Dwayne gaze forward and quietly absorb masculine place-based imagery (of John Ford's Red River): cowboys on a cattle drive to Missouri. Gleeful shouts of 'Ya-hoo' and 'yippee' ring out as powerful horse riding men direct hundreds of cattle north in possibly the same</page><page sequence="4">landscape that now, outside the doors of the Royal Theater, seems so bleak and unpromising. Sam the Lion's death signals not only the imminent de- mise of the movie theater, but also the end of an era for the town. When Sam dies, the town's last remaining bastion of that time goes with him; there is a void left by his loss that cannot be replaced. As Sonny comments, "[n]othing's really been right since Sam the Lion died." (McMurtry and Bogdanovich, 1970, p. 102A) With Sam's passing, none of the members of the younger generation, people like Sonny, Duane, and Jacy, have any figure from that older gener- ation to respect and emulate, because the presumption of the Old West is that such a figure should be male. Without having such a figure, it is unlikely that any of those still alive would be able to continue the tradition. Thus, the Old West in Anarene, and certain masculine privileges and values, die with Sam, symbolizing the declining power of the iconic Westerner's masculinity in America. The only hope for the continuation of some viable yet refashioned masculinity seems to lie with Sonny, who is left standing figuratively and literally alone in the main street after Duane leaves. At this point in the film however, he appears unable to break from the past, yet on the other hand, there is no reason to believe he is capable or willing to follow in the steps of Sam. Representing change and the New West The Last Picture Show uses its narrative, and its place imagery, to describe the considerable, complex, and inter- twined social and geographic changes that were transpiring in the decade following the end of WW II, notably the de- cline of small town America, the beginnings of profound changes in sex/gender systems, the demise of what was left of the romantic concept of the Old West, and the emerging salience of television in American society. Also embedded in the narrative are shifts that were occurring in the 1960s and 1970s, nearly a generation after the represented era. These changes were not dissimilar in character to those presented in the film, but by the time of the story's creation they were more manifest and concretized. Further, it was a different war that provided the geo-political circumstances as both background and subtle stimulus. The book was written in 1966 during the escalation of the Viet Nam War and the film was made five years later at the height of the war. The film's represented place, time, and the resultant nature of social- geographic change, then, can be read within the frame of two distinct and yet integrated eras. The Last Picture Show is a tale of the changes taking place in society during the early 1950s, but it is as much a commentary on those same trends realized in the early 1970s. The Last Picture Show eulogizes the fading importance of small towns, as well as the passing of the Westerner and the Old West. To understand the film's use of metaphor it is useful to note that the frontier trope of the Old West ". . .has a fixed point of inception (the Chicago convention of the American Historical Association in 1893), an authoritative text (The Significance of the Frontier in American History) and a single progenitor in the person of Frederick Jackson Turner". (Robbins, 1997, p. 1). Turner and those who de- liberately or implicitly built on his idea, created an image of the Old West that lives on in films, literature, popular ideas, as well as scholarly writing. These many diverse represent- ations of the West may be grouped into three overlapping periods in which the West was characterized first as fron- tier, second as region, and finally as postregion (Eutalin, 1996). In his contemporary representational history of the West, Eutalin draws on evidence from novels, paintings, and historical scholarship to discuss and elaborate these periods. The first, which he calls frontier, developed in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and "dramatized the experiences of newcomers entering the West to confront new landscapes and new peoples", (xiii) Jack London, Zane Grey, Frederick Jackson Turner, and Frederic Remington, as examples, depicted the region in rich and colorful ways that clearly distinguished the West from the rest of the country, but at the same time implicitly recognized the nature of a rapidly closing frontier within an American psyche. Starting in earnest in the 1920s, portrayals of the West as region began to emerge. These representations, which include the works of Willa Cather, John Steinbeck, Wal- ter Prescott Webb, and Thomas Hart Benton, centered on the development of a unique regional identity associated with the frontier's disappearance, especially by "examining changes within the West rather than focusing on newcomers to-the West" (Etulain, 1996, p. 80), and which functioned "as something of an anti-modernist escape valve from the rising pressure of immigration, urbanization, and industrialization that were assaulting the East." (Etulain, 1996, p. 4) The third period is the one within which The Last Picture Show can be contextualized: "Following the powerful transformations that World War II and the 1960s imposed on the west, many novel- ists, historians, and artists began to depict the West as an emerging postregion. Challenging earlier frontier images and moving beyond regional emphases, these painters and writers stressed not so much the shaping power of place on personality and character as the mo- mentous influences of race and ethnicity, and gender, and a new environmentalism as crucial elements of a postregional West." (Etulain, 1996, p. xiv) A variety of directions in experimental and even post- modernist paintings of the West began to develop, while novelists with strong ethnic ties, such as Rudolfo Anaya, N. Scott Momaday, and Amy Tan added perspectives hitherto unknown at a nationally recognized scale. Etulain includes within this period an emerging body of historical scholarship that contests Eurocentric views of history with their distor- ted and limited views of women and minorities, particularly Native Americans and Mexicans. The works of Patricia Nel- son Limerick (1987, 1991), Richard White (1991; White and Limerick 1994), and Donald Worster (1985), as ma- jor examples of this 'New West' literature "reject earlier more positive frontier interpretations of the West in favor of less triumphal, revisionist views of the region". (Etu- lain, 1996, p. xiv). Geographer Don Mitchell's study of the 280</page><page sequence="5">production of California landscapes (1996) highlighted the way in which place and landscape are integral to these new conceptualizations. The New West literature explicitly refers to scholarship, although it also presents a frame, a call, for unique and hitherto unrecognized narratives from other media: "In place of the old history of justified conquest, then, is a plea for a new history constructed from the 'unheard' voices of women, American Indians, and exploited workers. The sounding of these voices has increasingly been conveyed through nar- ratives of history, literature, and film that recognize the central role of image and identity." (Zonn and Winchell, 2002, pp. 142-143) In this paper, and in considering this film in particular, we would suggest that the role of place and place identity are dominant. The Last Picture Show falls within Etulain's representa- tional era of the postregion, in that it is explicitly concerned with the dramatic social and geographic changes that char- acterize the Post WW II West in general, and with changing gender identities more specifically. Further, it contests the Old West noted by Robbins and the region of Etulain while resonating with New West imaginaries. Although the film does not explicitly engage with the New West call for 'un- heard voices', notably here in terms of women, its contest- ation of Old West archetypes of masculinity provides fertile ground for the interrogation of place-based gender identities, relationships, and practices such that it encourage such nar- ratives. We contend that the film accomplishes this openness through a heightened sensitivity to the way particular mas- culinities are constituted in specific places. That is, The Last Picture Show recognizes that identity and place-identity are mutually constitutive and acknowledges that "places do not have single, unique 'identities'". (Massey, 1993, p. 67). In- stead, the film presumes an "accumulated history of a place, with that history itself being conceptualized as a product of layer upon layer of different sets of linkages both local and to the wider world." Massey (1993, p. 68) These contexts of the film's representation of the West - as postregion, as New West, as site of gender contestation - vary from direct to almost opaque, but each characterization provides insight into The Last Picture Show's depiction of the spaces and places of the West. Interestingly, McMurtry has denounced New Western historians (Robbins, 1991, p. 91), although it is important to note that he wrote the screenplay and the book (on which it was based) nearly twenty years before the widespread appearance of the New West literature. Further, Harris has contended that Bogdanovich may be responsible for em- phases in the film that resonate with New West sensibilities (Harris, 1990, p. 96), but his view may be overstating the role of the auteur, especially because of McMurtry' s role in development of the screenplay and because of the emphases of the book in the first place. Regardless, the book and film clearly offer a contestation of gender roles, more precisely an explicit recognition of internal and external forces reshap- ing masculinity, which falls within the general rubric of New West interests. The Last Picture Show's narrative documents profound transformations in sex/gender systems by focusing on defin- itions and practices that constitute the nature of masculinity in the Old West and the New West, which it does by fo- cusing on the experiences of a select number of individuals - primarily men, but also women - within several geo- graphic settings and scales. These representations do not occur within the frame of any traditional family structure, although the theme is strongly implicit in inter-relations between the two generations. The roles of Sam the Lion, Ruth, Geneviève, and Lois vis-à-vis Duane, Sonny, Jacy, and even Billy, are powerful, and their changes mark familial shifts occurring in society as a whole. Sex is likewise con- sidered to be a vital aspect of changing gender dynamics in The Last Picture Show. It is never romanticized or made to be scintillating, with the exception of fleeting references to the long-ago relationship between Sam the Lion and Lois. Instead, there is often an overwhelming naivete and on oc- casion a sense that sex is a means of relieving boredom in a town with little else to do. Clearly, women are seen to be in control of sex and to be stronger in most social re- lations, which is part of what seems to threaten Old West masculine ideals. The interrogation of masculinity's chan- ging definitions and experiences, then, is framed within a variety of social experiences that constitute a larger rubric of practiced gender roles, which is necessary to situate such an examination. (Connell, 1995, p. 202). The Last Picture Show uses the emergence of television and the decline of cinema, or at least the movie theater, as a metaphor for social change in America for the two eras. The nature of social transition is the film's preeminent concern, as it is in the book, but the effort Bogdanovich spends on the nature of the metaphor itself - the relations between TV and cinema and stylistic aspects of film - should not be discounted. (Harris ,1990, pp. 89-90). Indeed, he has claimed that "[the movie] was about the end of a way of life caused by the coming of the television" (Degenfelder, 1975, p. 91), which places TV in more than a simple metaphorical role. Further, his interest in cinema form was more than passing. He stylistically harkens to classic western films, notably those by Howard Hawks and John Ford, beginning with the use of black and white cinematography, which made it the first major film in four years to have been produced in such a manner. (Harris, 1990, p. 85) The stylistic reference has two immediate implications. First, it adds realism to the film as a portrait of the era. (Harris, 1990, p. 83) and adds resonance to the representation of individual characters (Graham, 1999). Second, the use of black and white plays into the film's conflicts of transition from one era to the next. By depicting Anarene and its surroundings in black and white, Bogdanovich further emphasized the tradition- ality and bleakness of the town, especially in contrast to what the director and audience might consider the multi- colored, vibrant landscape of 1971 America, particularly urban America. (Hitt, 1990, p. 289). His intent, then, was to evoke a nostalgic sense of a lost form of filmmaking while lamenting the rise of television, although there is little nos- 281</page><page sequence="6">talgia for the fading town, lifestyle, characters, and thus the character of society being lost. Prior to directing feature films, Bogdanovich was a well- known film critic who also directed a documentary entitled Directed by John Ford{'91'). He makes reference through- out The Last Picture Show to John Ford and other great directors of the 'golden age' of westerns, especially via his particular use of black and white photography. (Canby, 1971, p. 1) The cinematography is very reminiscent of Ford's work, only the subject matter is different. In this case, the decaying buildings of a small Texas town replace the tall spires of Ford's Monument Valley. (McReynolds, 1998, p. 47) As such, Bogdanovich is likely trying to provide a contrast between the previous vibrancy of the culture of the mythic West and its clear decline in Anarene. The last film that played in the theater in McMurtry's book was a low- budget, low-quality Audie Murphy movie - The Kid From Texas - meant to symbolize the fact that by that point, in Anarene "[l](/è has become a grade B movie itself." (Will- son, 1973, p. 169) Instead, for the final movie shown at the Royal Theater, Bogdanovich chose Red River (1948), the classic and quintessential western by Howard Hawks, with its heroic cowboys (including John Wayne and Montgomery Clift) and sense of open land and its associated possibilities for humankind. By using Red River, Bogdanovich accom- plishes two purposes (Cawelti, 1999): he can pay homage to Howard Hawks and his great film, and he is able to counter- point the epic West of the film with the real, much less heroic West of Anarene, further showing how that era has ended in the town. (Canby, 1971, p. 1). Cinema is cast in a positive light in The Last Picture Show, while television is not. In fact, the TV shows that appear in The Last Picture Show are represented as femin- ine entertainment that is available in the intimate spaces of private homes. The content of the TV shows are often in conflict with the feminized emotions of the characters in the scene (e.g., depression, hysteria, sadness). The most striking example occurs in the final scene in the film when Ruth Pop- per is raging and crying at Sonny's sudden return. While this action is taking place, the television is playing a commercial for Grandma's Lye Soap. The laughter accompanying this ad almost seems to taunt Ruth and Sonny and their tumultuous emotional states. (Harris, 1990, p. 90). This dissonance also surfaces with Jacy and Lois, both of whom lounge about in a very depressed mood while the TV plays sitcoms and game shows. Conversely, films in The Last Picture Show celebrate men and masculine values. Whenever a character in the film is watching a movie, they seem very interested by it, especially Billy who is entranced by whatever film is show- ing, while those watching television almost invariably seem bored and completely uninterested in it and its program- ming. As such, the movies are shown in the best possible light while TV is depicted as having no redeeming features. Adams (1992) has discussed television as a place without location, but here it takes on a physical and symbolic mani- festation, even if fleetingly. It is just a cold box sitting in people's houses, completely different from the living, breathing cultural mecca that is the movie theater. This constructed cinema-TV opposition set within Anarene is an essential and powerful symbol for a repres- entation of the complex social and geographic transitions that are essential to The Last Picture Show, then, but one as- pect of the argument's presumption needs to be considered: the reality of the place of television in 1951-1952 Amer- ica vis-a-vis cinema. Television was an emerging but not yet dominant form of entertainment during the Korean War, but McMurtry and Bogdanovich construct this dichotomy nearly a generation later by when the reader and viewer of that time were clearly familiar with the power of tele- vision. Thus, portending the role of television in The Last Picture Show, rather than describing the actual shift in the medium's influence, provides a powerful yet subtle symbolic statement. The Last Picture Show gives brief but symbolically powerful attention to the emergence of television as coun- terpoint to cinema, but nonetheless, the film's primary emphasis is still a representation of substantive social and geographic changes, of which the cinema-TV opposition is but one integrated and metaphorical segment, and so the de- cline of the small town and its social order within the frame of changing national-scale trends is still of paramount im- portance. Anarene and its immediate surroundings are cast as the places wherein the lives of the characters are lived, but the forces beyond the town - the Korean War, a shifting eco- nomic and social order, particularly the seeds of emerging gender shifts, which are all directly and indirectly associated with the emergence of TV - are significant in their capacit- ies to change the town's character forever. The town is set within the frame of its everyday and lived spaces, then, with its attendant implications of patriarchal power (Rose, 1993, pp. 17-40), while at the same time it can be contextualized within Massey's scale-rich layering of histories, places, and identities that shape a 'power-geometry' of flows and tend- encies in the wider world that will not be stopped at the city limits. Indeed, the story is about Anarene, but it is also about America. Place and place imagery in The Last Picture Show Masculinity and questions of sex/gender dynamics come to the fore in the use of place imagery in The Last Picture Show. Places within and beyond the small town signify mascu- line and feminine power and sexual dynamics. One of these places is the small town itself, although with the exception of the opening and closing shots, there is only one scene with a (complete) panoramic shot of the town. In this instance, Sonny sits by his truck at night, with the town presented as a very loose collection of lights with no detail. Within the town, the pool hall is a decidedly (although not exclusively) masculine place, while the restaurant is coded as a femin- ine and nurturing place. In between these two extremes, the Royal Theater, with the power to construct cinematic rep- resentations of places (and people), is at the heart of the story. 282</page><page sequence="7">Settings are used with great care in the film and fre- quently seem to stand in for people, in the anthropomorph- ized manner that the wide open spaces of the Old West stands for the iconic Westerner (or cowboy), and vice versa. In The Last Picture Show, the main street and the town of Anarene are the last remnants of the Old West, whereas the pool hall and Sam the Lion are interchangeable, as are Geneviève and the Texas Moon café. The interior of the movie theater, on the other hand, is a place where all things can be reinvented, contested, or more likely, reinscribed. Ideas, images, places, as well as heros are created here. Through watching films, one learns and explores who one is and who one can become, as well as one's place in the world. In The Last Picture Show, it is in the interior of the movie theater that the film creates fractal geographies in which images are particularly powerful through their endless repetition. Scenes of the Old West are portrayed on the large screen in such a way that we can see can see the power of the stark dramatic images themselves, and their simultaneous consumption by Billy, Jacy, Sonny and the other viewers. The fractal geographies of these interior theater scenes in turn, reverberate and increase in potency, as we move to other settings in the narrative. Anarene, Texas The Last Picture Show was filmed in the town of Archer City, Texas, the hometown of Larry McMurtry. Located southwest of Wichita Falls, the town was renamed Thalia2 for the book and Anarene for the film. The fact that Archer City is, like Anarene, a small agrarian west Texas town in decline, only adds to the verisimilitude of the picture. Further, almost all of the scenes in the film were shot in the Archer City area, including those at the lake, the high school, and the main street. (Graham, 1999) Bogdanovich chose to add a sense of realism to the film by choosing a real town rather than a constructing one on a Hollywood backlot. Highlighted, as we have said, in the opening and closing shots of the film, the main street of Anarene is the primary setting in The Last Picture Show. The film begins with an image of the still-open Royal Theater with its sign lit up promoting Father of the Bride, simultaneously evoking the ideal of a vibrant urban setting while providing a clear and patriarchal reference point. The camera then pans to the left to show the rest of the town's main street. The closing shot traces the exact opposite trajectory, panning from the road to the now-closed theater. The town is clearly in decline. Dust always seems to be blowing down the quiet streets from the seemingly never-ending Texas wind, locally referred to as a 'norther'. Most of the storefront signs have peeling paint, are highly faded, or have missing parts; the Texaco station is called T_XACO by one of its signs and TEX_CO by the other. The telephone poles and wires are the tallest things in the whole downtown, while the one small stoplight on the street hangs precariously from an overhead electrical wire. No one can be seen in the street, either in cars or as pedestrians, increasing the feeling of emptiness. The film's characters, many of whom reflect the town's dispirited setting, often comment on its empty and dreary character, as in the case of Lois, who declares "everything is so flat and empty here." (McMurtry and Bogdanovich, 1970, p. 25) The town is not viewed as picturesque or ex- citing in any way and people leave the town to seek such vistas. Sam comments on the plainness of town when he is out by the lake talking to Sonny, stating, "I jus' come out here to get a little scenery - too pretty a day to spend in town." (McMurtry and Bogdanovich, 1970, p. 55) Further, there is little to do in town. The pool hall provides some entertainment, but really just serves as a meeting place for the men. A sense of boredom permeates the town and the lives of its people. The women of Anarene experience the town in different ways than the men. The men are often portrayed as sick, weak individuals who sit around and complain. While Sam is often an exception to this rule, he is still seen coughing regularly, reflecting the dying state of the man and the pat- riarchal tradition of the Old West. Besides Sam, none of the adult male figures serve as role models for the younger gen- eration of Sonny and Duane. (Degenfelder, 1975, p. 84). The adult females of Anarene, on the other hand, are generally shown as strong women who may not set ideal models for the youth of the town to emulate, but who are "aggressive and resilient, though not invulnerable." (Harris, 1990, p. 96) Further, it is the wives in the town who are the real source of their family's wealth. Lois states that the only reason Mr. Farrow ever became rich was because of her forceful influ- ence on him. Geneviève is the sole money earner for her family, because her husband is sick and unable to work. The adult women of the town, rather than their male counterparts, are shown as sexually potent beings in the film. Lois and Ruth are the only adult figures of the town who openly admit to having sex during the time frame of the film. They control their sexual relations with Sonny, decid- ing if and when they will have sex with the young adult, who merely goes along with their whims. Meanwhile, the men, apart from the outsider named Abilene, are sexually bored and even impotent, as in the case of Coach Popper. The sole sexual exploit of any of the adult men is the tale of Sam's journeys out to the lake with Lois during the early 1930s, a long time away from the 1951 Anarene of the film. This idea of women holding the sexual power in the town is strongly reinforced by Jacy's manipulative relationship with Duane, Sonny and other young men of the town. Quite im- portant, her sexual power is considerably diminished when she leaves the confines of Anarene and ventures to the more urban setting of Wichita Falls, which emphasizes the differ- ences between the town and the world beyond. Her naivete and embarrassment at the first nude pool party she attends at Bobby Sheen's house is glaring. The contrast between the adult women and the men of Anarene is also seen in how they relate to the younger gen- eration of Sonny, Duane, and Jacy. The males of the town, apart from Sam the Lion, view the teenagers as delinquents and good-for-nothings who do not even care that they are consistently beaten in high school football games. Sam is different, though, in that he serves as a role model for Sonny and others by imparting to them the masculinist code of wis- 283</page><page sequence="8">dom of the Old West by in the forms of right/wrong and honor/dishonor. His status as a sage is weakened by his sick condition, however, and he "is forced to stand helpless as he watches the signs of moral and tangible decay envelop the once thriving community" (Harris, 1990, p. 94), and his death removes one of the last links to the past of Anarene, better times, and the older ways. The adult women, how- ever, tend to function as strong influences on of the young people, often within parental contexts, especially for Duane and Sonny, both of whom lack strong adult figures in their lives. Even Ruth's relationship with Sonny is maternal. She serves him milk and cookies, fixes his clothes, and generally looks after his well-being. In the end of the film, when Sonny has rejected her for Jacy and then returned after Jacy left him, despite all the anger and hurt Ruth feels, she still com- forts him in his weary emotional state through loving words and maternal caresses. The women have replaced the men's position in the edifying of the youth, which was the role of men in the Old West, a reversal symbolically represented by Ruth wearing Sonny's shirt while they lounge on the floor. Places within Anarene The Royal Theater has been an important landmark in Archer City, Texas for several generations. The theater was destroyed in a fire in 1965, but the outside of the build- ing was partially reconstructed for the filming of The Last Picture Show in 1971. The structure remained vacant for many more years, but in 1996 the community began to raise funds for its full reconstruction, which began in 1999, and on August 17, 2000, 35 years to the day from the fire, the Royal Theater was reopened as a facility for concerts, seminars, reunions, and is the "monthly home of the Late Week Lazy Boy Supper Club and the Texasville Opry" (per- sonal correspondence with staff of the Royal Theater and http://www.royaltheater.org/about.htm). The renovation and rejuvenation of old movie theaters is not unusual, which attests to the historical significance of these places as an important focus of the social spatial fabric of communities, from small agrarian communities to select areas of large cities (Jones, 2001, pp. 122-133; 2003) Clearly, the sig- nificance of the Royal Theater to Archer City was never completely lost, and today it once again plays an important role in the social life of the community. The Royal Theater of Anarene's The Last Picture Show was no less important to the community. The end of cinema and the rise of television in Anarene are symbols used to represent the changing of an era, and the Royal Theater is the site that is used to mark cinema's declining fortunes, and thus the decline of an old order. The theater had been the town's foremost symbol of identity, its connection to the outside world, and the most popular institution in town, but nonetheless, attendance had dwindled to almost nothing, for- cing its closure. Miss Mosey described this change when, on the night of the last film was shown at the Royal Theater, she said to Sonny and Duane, "[n]obody wants to come to pic- tures no more" (McMurtry and Bogdanovich, 1970, p. 109) Instead, everyone in the town is watching TV or simply do- ing other things. TV, says Thomas Harris, is "[t]he foremost exponent of the anesthetization of Anarene" (1990, p. 89). The emergence of TV and the closing of the theater, then, along with the death of Sam the Lion, symbolized the end of an era for the town, its characters, and of course, for a way of life for small town America. Its closure was a dying gasp for Anarene, a verification that there would be nothing left to hold the young, to keep them from leaving its constraining grip- By Anarene's standards, the Royal Theater was relatively elegant, with a façade that included a large marquee that lit up the night while proclaiming the latest features, but like the rest of Anarene, it was in decline. The entry room housed the concession stand and the ticket booth, both of which were operated by the elderly Miss Mosey. The only other room ever shown in the complex is the theater itself. It was a two-tiered structure with a balcony overhanging some of the seats below. The people attending the movie sat in particular sections of the theater, depending on their reason for being there. The balcony was the domain of Billy, who always sat on its edge with his feet hanging over the ledge, his eyes staring intently at the film. The middle area of the theater, about halfway down the aisle, is where most people went simply to see the film. The rear found the young adults, notably Sonny, Duane, and their respective girlfriends, who often went there in order to talk and 'neck'. The characters moved back and forth between the middle and back of the theater with regularity, suggesting the ease with which they could move between the two different aspects of life sym- bolized by these places. The Royal Theater was the sole cultural attraction of the town, and one where women were welcome, but its attendance was usually limited to the few local teenagers, and eventually it was forced to close. In fact, the theater would have been empty for the actual last picture show, apart from the ever-present Billy, if Duane and Sonny had not decided to come on a last minute whim just before Duane left for Korea. Compared to the theater and its relatively plush setting, the pool hall is an extremely bare and dry place, reserved for men and male conviviality. No adornment of any kind hangs on the falling-apart walls, while sand and dust fly in and out constantly. Light bulbs hang bare from the ceiling, except the covered light fixtures above the pool table. Likewise, the furnishings are also kept to a minimum, just pool tables, a few chairs, and the counter with the cash register. The sign on the front of the building has faded, one of the windows is cracked, and the screen door constantly whips back and forth in the wind, which provides the ever-present noise of wood whapping wood. Sam the Lion owns the pool hall, the Royal Theater and the Texas Moon Café, and his presence pervades all three, but they are quite different as venues for daily interactions of the people of Anarene. The pool hall is the domain of men - a clear and unfettered site of masculin- ism - where women never visit, and so the setting provides the opportunity for Sam to perform his Old West role as father figure. His role is distinct and immediate in terms of Billy in that both live upstairs and Sam monitors Billy's daily activities, which include the constant sweeping of the setting, but it is subtler in terms of Sonny and Duane. The 284</page><page sequence="9">two protagonists are figuratively parentless, and it is Sam who provides the paternal guidance they seem to need and appreciate. The gendered site of the pool hall allows him the freedom to perform this role, and so like Anarene it becomes a reference point of social transition in that it reflects the Old West opportunity whereby a man can realize his masculinity without the presence of women, but with his death that form of opportunity is lost. When Sam dies, he leaves the place to his figurative son, Sonny, which marks the end of an era; soon after, Jacy entered the pool hall for the first time. The Texas Moon Café, which is run by Geneviève, is better furnished than the pool hall. It is coded as a feminine and nurturing place in both its imagery and narrative posi- tion. Cushioned booths with wood-looking frames line the outside walls of the building, while tables with chairs take up the rest of the floor. A long counter serves as another seating area as well as a site for the cash register. A jukebox sits against one wall. The café is gendered in a form that is complementary to the pool hall (in the way that 'tradi- tional' sex roles are understood to be complementary). It is a place where all of Anarene is welcome, including famil- ies, and so a range of interactions takes place here. Further, Genevieve's warm nurturing presence dominates activities within its realm, even though it is owned by Sam, and many of her actions here may be considered as maternal, partic- ularly as she provides affection, advice, and guidance to Sonny and Duane, both of whom have parents who play little, if any, role in their lives. Sam's death brings a subtle yet powerful change to the café, in that the ownership and ultimate responsibility shifts from the symbolic father (and personification of the Old West) to the mother figure (who really had no place at all in the Old West). Ruth Popper lives in a modest, plain, white home, with a garage on the side and a porch in the middle of the front façade. Although there are a few homes in town that are far nicer, notably Jacy Farrow's, this one epitomizes the simpli- city of Anarene and is the site for the relationship between Sonny and Ruth. The only rooms ever shown are the kit- chen and the bedroom. The bedroom is initially covered with drab, ugly colored wallpaper, but Ruth seeks to revitalize it by wallpapering the room blue, Sonny's favorite color. In this way, she is attempting to improve her surroundings in the same way that her affair has improved her emotional state and her life in general. The house is the abode of the woman, both as lover and mother. It is where their sexual relations occur, but it is also where Ruth coddles Sonny as if he were her own son and where she chastises him for his earlier rejection of her motherly affections. Places beyond Anarene A feeling of claustrophobia seems to permeate Anarene, at least partially because it is so small that people cannot keep any secrets from one another. Everyone knows about the affair of Ruth Popper and Sonny, for instance, and Ruth is surprised when Sonny does not know about the sexual prob- lems between her and the coach. Geneviève says, "a person can yt sneeze in this town without somebody offerin ' him a handkerchief (McMurtry and Bogdanovich, 1970, p. 52). The film emphasizes this constrictive nature by the dearth of scenes actually set outside of Anarene. Instead, reference to these places are usually made as ideal destinations to go as a means of fleeing Anarene's restrictive ambience, and people are often encouraged, even by family, to move away. Indeed, McMurtry has referred to the view from the iong porch' of his childhood home: 'There, a mile away, was Highway 281, a road that could take one north into the heart of the plains, or south to Mexico. I had never heard of Mexico then, but I could look across the mile of plain and see many cars and trucks, all going somewhere - places I too might someday go" (McMurtry, 1999, p. 62). It should come as no surprise then, that the cinematic Duane and Sonny go to Mexico so they can "just take off and go someplace" Duane first leaves for the oil fields because there is no work and nothing left to do in Anarene. He eventually decides, almost diffidently, to enlist for Korea rather than stay in town. Early in the movie, Jacy wants to remain in Anarene after high school and go to college in Wichita Falls, but Lois tells her she should not stay. She is intrigued by her ventures to Wichita Falls to Bobby Sheen's house, even though she is ultimately less enthralled with him than she is with being away from Anarene, and the need to leave is part of the explanation for her short-lived attempt to elope with Sonny to Oklahoma. She eventually chooses to go to college and live in Dallas, never to return. It comes as no surprise, then, that some of the happiest moments in the lives of the characters are when they are in the car, on the open road, going somewhere. Ultimately, though, Sonny is the only young protagonist to resist this change when he chooses to turn his truck around and return to town at the end of the film. There are two places beyond Anarene that serve as im- portant sites in which the narrative of The Last Picture Show describes the transitions being experienced by the town and its people, and they can readily be linked to each other. The lake is actually a small reservoir and water tank created by a dam, but despite the fact that it is human made, it still reflects a seemingly natural and bucolic setting. It can be found in the barren countryside, surrounded by a few leafless trees, in a peaceful, although hardly beautiful, environment. Bunches of grass go up to the water's edge. In contrast, Bobby Sheen's indoor pool is set within a modern house in Wichita Falls. The walls and floor around the pool are covered with light colored tiles, giving the setting the look of an antiseptic and very large bathroom, which provides stark contrast to the lake. The two water bodies - the lake and the Sheen's indoor swimming pool - reflect different sides of a social transition of Anarene and the country. The lake is the place where Sam goes to escape the monotony of life in Anarene and to reminisce about his Old West past, and where he and Sonny sit on a bent-over tree branch and talk, with Sam implicitly and once again per- forming his paternal role. It is also in this place where he and Lois Farrow used to swim naked back in the 1930s. It was a very romantic and private experience. Like her mother, Jacy also skinny dips, but she does so in Bobby Sheen's swimming pool, where there are only young adults and no parents. Her experience is extremely public and unromantic, 285</page><page sequence="10">even going so far as to include a forced strip tease on the diving board. A comparison of the two places, then, shows two distinct sides of a social transition, from private, pa- ternal, and romantic interactions of the Old West, to public, peer-dominated and sterile moments of the new order. The old ways, as embodied by Sam and Lois, have been replaced by the new ideas of the next generation as represented by Jacy. (McReynolds, 1998, p. 48). Places not visually represented A few places not visually represented in the film are import- ant to the story nonetheless. These include places where a young man such as Duane can get a job in the oil industry, and places of war. While the oil fields are close at hand, and the war is in the faraway distance, reference to both places imply forceful economic and political processes that threaten to change small town life and simultaneously un- dercut certain entrenched masculine practices. Ironically, the momentum and force of these distant processes are refash- ioning new forms of masculinity on a wider geographical stage - as the US, in mid-twentieth century, moved to as- sume and consolidate a hegemonic role in global affairs. We suggest that these places - of oil production and of foreign warfare - signify several interrelated threats to Old West masculinities. Furthermore, these individual places stand for changing geopolitical realities and the intrusion of these realities on the cocooned and provincial psyches of people living in US small towns in the mid-twentieth century. In the metaphor of the Old West presented in The Last Pic- ture Show, these global transitions portend the failure of the provincial ideals of the Old West in which nothing beyond the frame of the region was of significance. We suggest therefore, that the places in the film's narrative that are not visually represented in the film are an allusion to the chan- ging role of the US in the world, at a time when the US is assuming and consolidating a hegemonic and imperial role in the world. If we consider this point in terms of the Western film genre, it is quite clear the Western was a self-contained world in which all important events were shaped directly by men in their 'own' environments. Distant issues were of little concern. By contrast, in 1950s and 1970s US, the problems of the world were intruding on these parochial representations with such force that they could no longer be ignored. The Western genre celebrated an imperial pro- ject within (and bounded by) the West, whereas the other is an imperial project expanding outward from the country's boundaries. The transition entailed certain changes in mas- culinities which the film suggests are imminent but by no means determined. Conclusion This paper has been concerned with a particular kind of place - small town America - as it is represented in the film The Last Picture Show (1971). The discourse of small town America is an undeniably powerful element of this country's social and geographical history, and, in fact, wrote Veblen, it represents ". . .one of the great American institutions. . . in the sense that it has had a greater part than any other in shaping public sentiment and giving character to American culture" (quoted in Levy, 1991, p. 15). The Last Picture Show represents the daily lived experiences of the people of small-town Texas as they are practiced within places of Anarene and as they are contextualized within the larger scale frame of the country that lies beyond its borders, pre- sumably within a "power- geometry and a progressive sense of place." Changes in these represented practices as they occur over the course of the film and for the depicted time are used as a metaphor to describe, reflect, and chronicle changes within national-scale social and geographic realms of the country. An important emphasis of the film is a con- testation of the masculinities that characterize the decline of the Old West. The theme of a contested and redefined masculinist he- gemony within the geographies of Anarene is essential to the nature of The Last Picture Show, and the markers of change can be found throughout, from the subtle reference points of the perpetually losing football team and a sexually impotent coach to the descriptions of evolving gender practices within a variety of places, the sexual practices between men and women, and the reconstructed and gender-specific roles of parenting. The film describes shifts from old to new and from the Old West to, if not a New West, certainly a new order where the Old West is history. The contestation of masculinities notwithstanding, an es- sential and concluding question of The Last Picture Show needs to be raised: to what extent does this depiction recog- nize changing gender roles, with its presumably concomitant representation of the emerging power of women, or to what extent is it simply a lamentation of the loss of the power of 'man'? The conclusion here is that the film is a nostalgic description of loss - of a time, of a place, of the mythologies of the Old West - and it is a narrative of nostalgia for a lost and idealized masculinity. The recognition of masculinity and gender roles in The Last Picture Show is less than 'relational'. The focus is upon the nostalgia of a weakened man in terms of his mas- culinist practices and yet it is not immediately concerned with the nature of the hegemonic discourse within which he has been operating, only with his loss, not her gain. The loss of the Old West is the loss of 'man' and his powers, practices, motifs, and his all-important history. Further, wo- men are seen to be impediments to these practices or they are presented in essentialist and prescribed roles, from the woman as a manipulative and sexual controller (Jacy and Lucy, as examples) to the woman whose role is maternal (Ruth and Geneviève, for examples). There are certainly new 'places' for women, as with Jacy's entrance into the pool hall, Geneviève' s new role as proprietor of the restaurant, and Ruth's redefinition of her own home, but they are all de- pendent upon the decline of men, from his death to a lowered expectation of where he 'fits' in the new non-Old West order. So, while indeed the representation of the decline of mas- culinity contests the old order, it does so reluctantly, as if it 286</page><page sequence="11">287 is a recognition that something is being lost and that there is nothing a redefined and weaker man can do about it. There is still no clear and empowered vision of place for women in the new order, only a lamentation for the loss of man. As such, masculinities of The Last Picture Show may reflect a recontextualized form of the patriarchal order, but it is still is neither relational nor without essentialist representations. The Old West has taken a new shape, much to the chagrin of man, but it is hardly a 'New West', with its emerging and representative forces. Filmography Directed by John Ford. 1971.

Endnotes 'in discussing mise-en-abyme, Aitken and Lukinbeal draw on the work of Diane Elam (1994) who uses the example of the man on the Quaker Oats box who holds an identical box of Quaker Oats. As Aitken and Lukinbeal (1998) note, the "representation folds into itself ad infinitum in the same way that fractal clusters generate exactly the same patterns at higher resolution." 2Thalia is the Greek muse of comedy and pastoral poetry. McMurty acknowledges the power and inspiration of place in a quite direct fashion by renaming his home town for this muse. References Adams P., 1992: Television as gathering place.
