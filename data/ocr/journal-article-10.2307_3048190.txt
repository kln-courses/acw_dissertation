<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TORU14 QUINITY IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM IN WARSAW* TADEUSZ DOBRZENIECKI In the eleventh century English manuscript which has been ascribed to the Winchester school of painting there is a unique drawing inserted in the Officium Trinitatis: two male divine persons in cruciform halos and with open books-God the Father and God the Son-are seated on a semicircular vault.' This is an illustration of the messianic Psalm I09.2 At the right of the Son, the Second Person of the Trinity, the Vir- gin Mary is seated, holding the Child in her arms. The Infant Jesus has a cruciform nimbus and holds an open book in his left hand. Mary wears a crown on which the dove in a cruciform halo, the Holy Ghost, is seated as in a nest. This unique image of five persons has been * I am much indebted to Miss Paulina Ratkowska for the English translation of my article. i. E. H.

Its singularity is largely due to the double presentation of Christ, which obviously resulted from the artist's desire to depict simultaneously two natures of Jesus: the human and the divine. Kan- torowicz, who made a thorough analysis of the image, was convinced of the exceptional character of the rep- resentation and, indeed, until now, no parallel to it has been found in mediaeval art.' A panel of the altar (ca. 1390) from the Franciscan Church in Toruni (Thorn), now in the National Mu- seum in Warsaw,5 shows a group of five divine per- sons--thus, also the Quinity. Along with God the Fa- ther and the Holy Ghost, Christ is represented, but this time thrice: as the Son of God--the Second Person of the Trinity; as the Crucified; and as the Lamb. The panel from the Toruni altar and the English miniature both have a trinitarian-christological char- acter. Thus the question arises: what doctrinal reasons induced the master of the Franciscan painting to rep- resent Christ simultaneously in a triple shape? In an ample mandorla a grey-haired bearded old man is seated frontally on a semicircular arc, slightly turned and bending the upper part of his body to the right (Fig. i). His head is surrounded by a cruciform halo; his bare feet emerge beneath a long mantle. Blessing with his right hand, which points downward, he holds in the left a disc on which the four elements of the cosmos are depicted. In front of the man's breast there is a little robed child in a half-sitting position. He has no nimbus. The right hand of the child is raised and grasps an object only partially preserved, most prob- ably a scroll. In the upper field of the mandorla a white dove is placed in the bifurcation of the Y-cross, the Tree of Life. The dove has a cruciform nimbus around its head. From the differences in representation of the persons of the Trinity, in the mandorla we may read the main theological content of the trinitarian dogma. The old man, the antiquus dierum,' is the First Person of the Trinity, God the Father,' who everlastingly gives birth to the Son, who is on the Father's lap.8 The eternal existence with the Father is an original and natural 3. As to the terminology used by Kantorowicz, Braunfels (op.cit., p. XLVI, note 104), objects that "so beispielhaft ge- schmacklose Begriffsbildungen, wie 'binity,' 'quaternity' oder 'quinity' sich nicht einbiirgen." It is, however, necessary to remember that the term quaternitas was used twice in an adjudication of the 4th Lateran Council in 1215, which con- demned a treatise of an abbot Joachim: Ille non tam trini- tatem, quem quaternitatem astruebat in Deo. In Deo solum- modo Trinitas est non quaternitas. (Denzinger, Enchiridion symbolorum, Nos. 431, 432) The term trinitas was used for the first time by Tertullian (J. P. Migne, Patrologiae cursus completus, Series latina, II, col. 157). 4. Double christological representations, however, without any reference to the Trinity theme, were studied recently by R.

Vienna, Cod. suppl. gr. 52, fol. Iv, is the old man to be understood as God the Father. In the Latin West at the end of the century in Hildegard of Bingen's Scivias God the Father is represented in the form of an old man, holding a symbolic lamb (see Hildegard von Bingen.

Thus, the painter of the panel has shown the triplicity of the persons, each really different from the others, and, moreover, their relationship. The first of them a nulla procedit, the second proceeds from the first per veram generationem, and the third person from both the first and the second tanquam ab uno principio. The relationship between the third and the first and second persons is expressed by the placement of the symbolic dove at the apex of the vertical axis of the whole com- position, above the Father and the Son. However, the artist did not represent the procession of the third per- son as accomplished per spirationem of the Father and the Son. The Father and the Son in the Torufi panel exempli- fy the representational type known as the Paternity, which various scholars have noted," but which only Adelheid Heimann investigated exhaustively.12 Hei- mann's valuable article remained inaccessible to almost all later students of trinitarian iconography. Therefore, it seems worthwhile to recall here the conclusions of the author. Following the iconographic pattern of the Virgin Nicopoia, which was intended as an expression of the maternity of Mary, the artist of an eleventh century Byzantine codex depicted God the Father enthroned in a mandorla with the Son on his lap, holding the Dove (Fig. 2).1" This Byzantine formula, later taken up by Russian icon painting,"4 became very important for Western art. Its influence is visible at least from the middle of the twelfth century. It is Spain that sup- plies the earliest known examples of this representation in the West.15 In a tympanum relief from the church of Santo Domingo in Soria the Dove hovering above the head of God the Father who holds the Son and a ring of angels surrounding the central group reveal Byzantine sources. In Germany the Byzantine formula may be noticed for the first time about 1200 (Fig. 3).x8 On a stained glass medallion of about 1275 from Saint Elisabeth's in Marburg the Dove is seated on the Child's head as a visible link between the Father and the Son." This position of the Dove came henceforth to be gen- erally accepted since it best expressed the Western be- lief in the Holy Ghost's procession from both the Fa- ther and the Son. A Bohemian psalter of the early thirteenth century, known as the Codex Ostroviensis, contains a full-page miniature inspired by the grouping of the Nicopoia.18 The Father holds a medallion with the bust of the Son in it. Between these persons the Dove is hovering, con- necting the one with the other. The composition re- sembles that of the Maiestas Domini in the surrounding of the mandorla with four Evangelist symbols. This amplification of the iconographic scheme produced an image which may be called the Maiestas Trinitatis. In the middle of the fourteenth century another Bo- hemian Trinity, in the Liber Viaticus of John of Neu- markt, also shows a medallion, held by God the Fa- ther, but it contains a representation of the Man of 603 in the British Museum repr. by Kantorowicz, op.cit., fig. 35. In the x th century Greek lectionary on Mount Athos (Dionysiu 740, fol. 3v) the representation of a seated old man with the child on his lap illustrates the text of John cited above (see K. Weitzmann, "The Constantinopolitan Lectionary, Morgan 639," Studies in Art and Literature for Belle Da Costa Greene, Princeton, 1954, p. 365, fig. 294). In the Bible of Saint-B6nigne de Dijon, executed about Iooo, in the initial at the beginning of the Gospel of John there is the similar image (Heimann, op.cit., p. 50). 9.

The combination of God the Father and a symbol of the Passion and Resurrection had occurred earlier. In Hildegard of Bingen's Scivias of about 80o God the Father holds a medallion which contains the Lamb bearing a cross--a soteriological symbol of Christ.20 A parallel image of Abraham with Lazarus in the shape of a child, drawn from the evangelical parable (Luke i6: I9-3i) and symbolizing heavenly beatitude, displays formal resemblances to the iconographic scheme of the Virgin and Child. A variant of the image shows Abraham holding the Infant Jesus in a cruciform nimbus."1 An ivory in the Vatican Museum furnishes evidence as to the French use of the Byzantine iconographic for- mula in the fourteenth century.22 God the Father with the Son on his lap is surrounded by four evangelist symbols. In an Italian prayer-book of the second half of the fourteenth century and in the well-known Rohan Hours of the early fifteenth we find some modifications of the type.23 In these representations Heimann read the last transformations of the Paternity by Western artists. It seems appropriate to mention here two later Polish examples of this type. In a miniature of a Psalter of Pulawy of the sixteenth century on the breast of God the Father is an oval medallion containing the Man of Sorrows. The Dove is above the head of the Father (Fig. 4).24 In a rural church at Slopanowo a Baroque altar in the south aisle contains a wooden statue of the Virgin and Child (Christus secundum humani- tatem). Above it, in the gable of the altar, God the Father is also seen with the Child (Christus secundum divinitatem).25 On the Toruni panel God the Father is seated di- rectly in front of the crucified Christ, whose upstretched arms and crossed feet, nailed to the cross, are the only parts of his body visible. Particularly noticeable, the head of God screens from our sight that of the Cruci- fied, since both figures are exactly the same size. The two-dimensional grouping of Christ concealed by the Father and equal to him in size corresponds to the doc- trine of incessant interpenetration of the persons of the Trinity. The painter of the Toruni panel has illustrated in his work most clearly and literally the statement on the interpenetration that had been formulated by Christ, according to John Io: 30, 38: Ego et Pater unum sumus. Pater in me est et ego in Patre.2" This inter- penetration of the persons of the Trinity was termed by the Greeks 7rEPLXobpEco-Y and by the Latin Christians circumincessio. A miniature of the Rohan Hours testifies that me- diaeval artists sometimes attempted to depict the cir- cumincession: it shows a crowned gray-bearded old man, with a globe and a sword in his hands, bending over a dying man. The characteristics seems to indicate that it is God the Father who is represented here as the Judge. However, a Latin inscription at the rim of his nimbus identifies him as Christ.28 In the case of the Toruii painting we are faced with a more complete representation--even if expressed by limited anthropomorphic means--of the true sense of 19.

The Greek term expresses the passing of the one person into the other, while the Latin stresses the abiding of the one person in the other, see A. Deneffe, "Perichoresis, Circumincessio, Circum- insessio," Zeitschrift fiir katholische Theologie, XLVII, 1923, pp. 491-532. It seems useful to recall that the term circum- insessio was used by St. Bonaventure, who gave the following definition of the "circumincession": specialis modus essendi in alio, qui non reperitur proprie in creaturis. . . . In Deo solo est proprie et perfecte ratione perfectae unitatis essentiae cum distinctione personarum. Opera omnia, I, Quaracchi, 1882, pp. 350, 353. 28. A. Heimann ("Der Meister des Grandes Heures de Rohan und seine Werkstatt," Stiidel-Jahrbuch, vii/viii, 1932, p. 20o), although she did not call this scene by its proper name, described it correctly: "Die Gestalt des Richters ver- einigt in sich Gottvater und Sohn. Der alte Kopf mit weissem Haar stellt den Vater dar und die Inschrift auf dem Nimbus 'Jhesus nazarenus-rex judeorum' bezeugt, dass zugleich der Sohn gemeint ist." Gerstinger (op.cit., p. 82) discussed the perichoresis in Eastern and Western representations; all of his examples, however, may be designed as intermediate-the author did not cite any work in which the interpenetration of the persons has been wholly accomplished. E. Panofsky (op. cit., p. 433) states that not every anthropomorphic representa- tion of the divine person is either that of Christ or that of God the Father: "From a dogmatic point of view one person of the Trinity unless specifically identified as the First, the Second or the Third Person, ipso facto implies the two others. This is unmistakably stated in a miniature of the ioth cen- tury showing what every art historian would call a Christ in Majesty but inscribed: 'Omnipotens Trinitas, unus et verus Deus, Pater, Filius et Spiritus Sanctus'." For this and further examples of the Trinity in the one-man form see ibid., n. 63. Panofsky's argument may be supplemented by the observation that these representations express the theological content of the perichoresis: the oneness of nature and the real distinctness of the persons (the latter being visualized in the inscriptions). The oneness of essence of the persons supports the concept that one of them abides in the others, see Thomas Aq. S. Th. p. I, q.42, a.5 and the adjudications of the Council of Florence (Denzinger, op.cit., No. 704).</page><page sequence="5">384 THE ART BULLETIN the circumincession.29 Its uniqueness lies in the fact that Christ is depicted here as crucified, thus at the exact moment of consummation of his earthly mission. The painting reveals the truth that the Son, who was sent down by God the Father and took upon himself a hu- man shape, is simultaneously a true God and Man, that in the person of Christ the hypostatic union of these na- tures is accomplished, that perseverait triduo mortis.80 The representational motif discussed above provides a fine illustration of St. Ireneus' words: Ipsum Verbum Dei suspensum est super lignum.sl The further in- terpretation of this motif will show its great significance for the meaning of the iconographic program. From the outstretched arms of Christ, nailed to the cross, a double veil hangs down, made of a carefully patterned brocade. The explanation of the deep symbolic meaning of the unusual motif of the veil covering the body of the Crucified is found in the Epistle to the Hebrews, unanimously ascribed by mediaeval commentators to St. Paul the Apostle. The Scriptures relate of a veil in the Temple of Jerusalem. The Septuagint describes it as KaTaiETracraTa and the Vulgate as velamen. It was believed to be made of the most delicate material threaded through with scarlet and purple.82 Josephus gave the following de- scription of the veil: "... a tissue blossomed with col- ours of hyacinth, purple and scarlet, made of the most shining and delicate byssus."3" On the authority of this historian the veil of the Temple was double. On the other hand, the Talmud and Mishna held that it was a single piece of fabric. The veil was of great liturgical significance since it was the only separation between the sacred place and the inaccessible Sancta Sanctorum, where the Throne of Mercy was kept. The High Priest alone was allowed to pass through the veil on the day of Reconciliation and then it was sprinkled with blood."' The Synoptic Gospels tell us of a tear in the veil at the moment of Christ's death on the cross, but only the Epistle to the Hebrews interprets the veil symbolically, on the ground of the parallel between the Old and New Testaments. The author of the Epistle expresses in detail an idea most important to him-the priesthood of Christ."6 The didactic section of the Epistle, followed by the parenthetic one, is concluded by the sentence: Habentes itaque fratres fiduciam in introitu sanctorum in sanguine Christi, quam initiavit nobis viam novam et viventem per velamen [&amp;La 'oVi KaTav1TETaO7Lrao], id est, carnem suam, et sacerdotem magnum super domum Dei." The veil of the Temple of Jerusalem was a symbol of the inaccessibility of Jahve. On the contrary, Christ has opened the accession to God. The accomplishment of this important act is expressed by the metaphor of the veil, which having been first a closing becomes a sym- bol of opening, of entrance. The veil is identified with the body of Christ, which at the moment of his death became an instrumental cause of enabling accession to God. The author of the Epistle defines the priesthood of Christ as the way by which he passes through the veil (his body), and by which he penetrates to the throne of God. In this, Christ, the Priest, prepares the way for the accession of mankind to the Father. The way to the throne of God goes through death-the self-sacrifice on the cross-for sacrifice is the very essence of a priest's function. Christ performs his priestly function in the celestial temple. His mediation is omnipotent since, being the Son of God, he is united with the Father (TrePLXdpEtGpe). The fundamental complement of the idea of Christ's priesthood is his divine filiation. Hence, at the begin- ning of the main didactic section of the Epistle, St. Paul states that the High Priest is identical with Jesus, Son of God.87 As in other letters of St. Paul, the Epistle to the Hebrews has been subject to various interpretations.88 To understand the meaning of the program of the Toruni panel it is necessary to know the patristic"" and mediaeval' commentaries on the verse of the Epistle we are concerned with. All of them espoused the iden- tity of the veil of the Temple with the body of Christ. St. Anselm of Canterbury bears witness to this opinion of the exegetes: . . . per velamen, id est per significatum illius velaminis, quod duo tabernacula dividebat, id est per carnem suam, patefacta est nobis via in sancta sanctorum, id est in supernam Ierusalem.41 In the mandorla of the Toruni panel we see this 29.

Christ penetrated here to perform his priestly function in the union with God (irepX6dpeCo-). By the simplest means the painter reveals the doctrinal connection between the veil of the Temple and the body of the Crucified. The veil is represented according to its proper function: it is hung from the arms of Christ, the Priest, who as the eternal Son of God-Logos-is shown on the lap of his Fa- ther. Christ had departed from God and returned to him.42 In this heavenly liturgy four apocalyptic beasts and four angels participate."' The angels sing the eternal rpur-aytov according to Isaiah 6: 3 and look attentively at the mystery shown in the mandorla." The inclusion in the liturgy of the apocalyptic beasts, the Evangelist symbols, may be traced back to St. Irenaeus."' We see now that the representational motif-the Paternity-known for a long time, generally as an in- dependent image, is used here in conjunction with a new image: that of the Crucified with the veil of the Temple hanging down from his outstretched arms. This double representation of pre-existent and incarnate Christ provides a precise illustration of St. Paul's idea of Christ, the Son of God and the Priest-the im- molator.46 On the miniature of the eleventh century codex of Abbess Uta, Christ crucified is depicted as a king and as a priest, the latter according to the Epistle to the He- brews. Christ as priest in the Uta Codex is prefigured by Melchisedech.4 An even more important work, which helps us to understand the Torufi representation, is a miniature with a scene of the Crucifixion in a Gos- pels of the second half of the twelfth century (Fig. 5)-' On the right side above the cross-bar is the bust of David and the verse of Psalm I o9: Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Melchisedech. On the other side the bust of St. Paul is seen and the quotation from the Epistle to the Hebrews: Per proprium san- guinem introlvit semel in sancta. According to the Epistle to the Hebrews Christ is a priest who offers a victim, but he himself is also a pro- pitiatory victim.'" St. Paul equated the death of Christ to the sacrifice of the paschal lamb."5 In the lower part of Toruni panel, in the terrestrial zone, we see a third representation of Christ in the shape of a lamb, nailed to a medallion formed by the branches of the Tree of Life (Fig. 6). At the left, St. John the Baptist stands point- ing to the lamb, for in his prediction of the expiatory death of Christ, the Precursor named Jesus the Lamb of God. St. John the Evangelist, his pupil, and, later, the Apostle, put these words of the Baptist into his Gospel. In his own explanation of the sacrificial death of Christ, John the Evangelist recognized Jesus as the paschal lamb. The figure of St. John the Evangelist is placed at the right side of the medallion with the lamb, opposite that of John the Baptist the Precursor."5 Pa- tristic and mediaeval exegesis,"5 for example that of St. Bonaventure"5 conceived the biblical texts related to the Lamb in the same way. The Lamb on the Toruni panel is represented at the moment of death, of destruction, for destruction con- stitutes the essential feature of every sacrifice. The con- 42.

According to John, Jesus, who died on the cross at the same time at which the Old Testament paschal lamb was killed, is himself the true paschal lamb, whose bones could not be broken. As his attribute, the Evangelist holds a chalice with the Host this also occurs on another panel of the Torufi altar, a Pieta. As to this attribute instead of the usual chalice with poison see K. Kiinstle, Ikonographie der Christliche Kunst, ii, Freiburg in Br., 1926, p. 342 n. 2. The gesture of St. John the Evangelist indicating the chalice with the Host corresponds to that of the Precursor pointing to the cru- cified Lamb and signifies the sacramental presence of the Lamb under species of bread and wine. 52.

A pre- figuration of this outpour was the Old Testament ritual of sprinkling or outpour of blood on the day of Recon- ciliation. The Synagogue, personification of Old Testa- ment ritual, is seen on the panel to the left of the Lamb. The antithesis-Ecclesia-is collecting the Lamb's blood into a chalice, for the blood of the Lamb is identical with the Eucharistic blood.55 The original idea of St. Paul's soteriology is an anti- thetic parallel between the first and the second Adam."5 The Pauline typology: Adam-Christ was the basis of the later mediaeval tradition, which, as time passed, was enriched by various details. The early evidence may be found in a sermon of Ephrem the Syrian:" Mense Aprili Dominus Adami debitum solvit; Aprili sudorem pro frustraneo ipsius Adae sudore effudit; crucem pertu- lit ut per arborem eriperet qui per arborem ceciderat. A gnus feria sexta immolatus occubuit, quia videlicet hac ipsa die Adam peccavit. New typological details were inserted into the "Cave of Treasures," a work written in Ephrem's school:5" "Adam was created in Jerusalem in the same place where later the cross of Christ was elevated. On Fri- day, at three o'clock he ascended into Paradise . . . The Tree of Life in the middle of Paradise was an example of the cross of Redemption, the true Tree of Life, which stood in the middle of the earth." Adam commanded his son Seth to bury his body in the cave of treasures. His further commandment was as follows: "The one of all your descendants who will endure, he at your departure from this land will take my body along with himself and bury it in the middle of the earth. There I shall find salvation and so also will all my descendants." "On Friday, at the same hour at which the Son of Man on the cross gave his soul to his Father . . . Adam departed this world. Sem took the body of Adam to Golgotha and dug the grave in the shape of a cross. And then Sem and Melchisedech buried the corpse in the hole . . . and the inner doors of the earth then shut. . .. When the cross of the Messiah was elevated these doors opened over Adam. And when above these doors the base of the cross was inserted, and the Messiah, pierced with a spear, ob- tained victory, then blood and water flowed down into the mouth of Adam and became the baptism to him."" A number of motifs of this early Christian text found their place in pictorial representations of the typological theme, Adam-Christ. The "Cave of Treasures" enables us to understand the triple streams of blood that are seen in the open grave of Adam and the red-and-white stream on the first man's lips. The text mentions blood and water flowing into the mouth of Adam during the Crucifixion.60 The Baptism of Adam, conceived as his second birth, causes his awakening and, sometimes, his rising from the grave.6' In patristic literature, in mediaeval poetry and leg- ends the tree that grew in medio paradisi is recognized as a prototype of the cross, which stood in medio uni- versi. On the Toruni panel the Tree of Life growing from the grave of Adam is identified with the cross. As early as the third century Carmen de Pascha vel de Ligno Vitae tells of the Tree of Life reaching out its branches to embrace all the world.62 The symbolism of the legends molded various mediaeval representations that expressed an idea called Sacramentum ligni vitae."8 A Talmudic legend, of which most exact version is preserved in the "Book of the Bees," written by the Syrian bishop Solomon in the thirteenth century, pro- duces the oldest evidence of the belief that the cross of Christ was made of the paradisiacal Tree of Life.64 The first phase of the development of the legend, 54.

Although he planted them in separate places, they grew together. King David noticed the tree with three kinds of foliage and guessed its symbolic sig- nificance. Solomon ordered the transplanting of this tree to a spot in front of the Temple, and the sybil of Nicaula predicted its ultimate destination: Simeon the carpenter would make of this tree the cross of the Saviour."65 In the lower left hand corner of the Toruni panel (Fig. 7) three trees with differentiated foliage, their trunks close to each other, seem to provide an illustration of this legend."6 According to St. Augustine a double feast was cele- brated on March 25-the Annunciation and the Cru- cifixion.67 It was enlarged later to include also the cult of persons connected with the Crucifixion. A mis- sal of the tenth century mentions the birth of Adam on this day. Various liturgical texts68 reflect an old tra- dition, traceable to the third century,6" which tells that at the same hour and place the first and the second Adam died and were entombed. The theological connection between the Annuncia- tion and the Crucifixion on the one hand and the birth, death and baptism of Adam on the other is visualized on the Kalisz paten of about II93 (Fig. 9).'o Early Christian writers had already inserted the Tree of Life into the scene of the Annunciation.71 In the light of the above discussion it may be conclud- ed that the theological program of the Torufi panel corresponds to the conception of Christ as Priest and Victim, the conception that was formulated in the Epis- tle to the Hebrews. But the picture also displays a close connection with the liturgy of Easter, with the Prae- conium paschale sung by a deacon on the vigil of Easter during the consecration of the candle, which is a symbol of Christ and his work of Redemption.72 The seventh century text begins with the solemn invitatorium: Ex- ultet iam angelica turba coelorum, exultent divina mis- teria. After this introduction the proper prayer follows: Vere dignum et iustum est invisibilem Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Filiumque eius unigenitum, dominum nostrum lesum Christum, toto cordis ac mentis affectu, et vocis ministerio personare. Qui pro nobis aeterno Patri Adae debitum solvit et veteris piaculi cautionem pio cruore detersit. Haec sunt enim festa paschalia, in quibus verus ille agnus occiditur cuius sanguine postes fidelium consecrantur. This liturgical text accents the triple christological aspect, already known from the Epistle to the Hebrews-that of the Son of God, of the incarnate Christ, offering the bloody victim of propitia- tion for the sin of Adam, and that of the Lamb of God.73 We find here also the divina misteria and an- gelica turba invited to sing the hymn. On the Torufi panel they are the four angels and the four apocalyptic beasts that surround the mandorla."7 The identical illus- trations of the introduction to the Exultet hymn and, at the same time, the oldest pictorial interpretation of the text are provided by Italian Exultet rolls. The connection of the Toruni panel with the Exultet proves that the painting expresses the christological con- tents of the Eastern liturgy. They were defined in the same way by St. Augustine in his Sermo in Pascha: Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus qui sicut ovis ad occisionem ductus est et sicut agnus coram tondente se sine voce sic non aperuit os suum. Iste est agnus qui in altari crucis hostia viva Dei Patri pro nobis in odorem suavitatis oblatus, transitum nobis de regione umbrae mortis ad terram repromissionis patefecit. Iste est in- quam, qui simul victima et sacerdos, omnem veteris sac- 65. Kampers, op.cit., pp. 98-99. A later evidence of famil- iarity with the legend in the Middle Ages is given by U. Pinder in Speculum Passionis, Nuremberg, 1507, fol. liiv: Quatuor ligna crucis. Fertur etiam crux quatuor lignorum genera habuisse, scilicet cedram in stipite. Palmam in palo per longum. Cipressum in ligno ex transuerso. Oliuam in tabula super crucem: loco quarti brachii. Cedrus altitudinem con- templationis significat. Cipressus famam bone opinionis. Palma fructum iustitie. Oliua lenitatem misericordie. Crux igitur Christi merito lignum vite appellatur: quia ex ea triplicem vitam colligimus [vitam nature, gratie, glorie]. 66. On the Toruni panel two baskets with loaves of bread placed at the top of the Tree of Life allude to the twelve loaves of bread kept in the Temple of Jerusalem, mentioned by St. Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews i x: 2. An explana- tion of their symbolic meaning in accord with the general idea of the Toruni picture may be found in Pinder's Speculum Passionis. The author, expressing a conviction current in the Middle Ages speaks about the twelve fruits of the Crucifixion (fructus vitae) and identifies them with the Old Testament loaves of bread (duodecim panes in mensa propositionis; fol. lii). 67.

The formula of St. Augustine found its pictorial em- bodiment on the Toruni panel. We see here the Lamb on the altar of the Cross (nailed to the Cross) as the living Host (the circular medallion is at the same time a liturgical paten symbolizing the Cross)."7 A Caro- lingian manuscript with pericopes provides an early ex- ample of this original motif: the bleeding Lamb is represented in a circle, undique septus, as an inscription explains, and Ecclesia, standing below, collects the Lamb's blood in a chalice.77 An illustration in a Specu- lum Humanae Salvationis of about 1450 shows a num- ber of motifs with the Tree of Jesse among them."" The Tree of Jesse is simultaneously the cross of Christ and in its circular medallion there is the Lamb with a chalice. St. Augustine borrowed the concept in his sermon from the Epistle to the Hebrews. But it is this Latin writer who claims our attention, for he gave the most complete approach to christology79 and exerted a great influence upon mediaeval theological speculations.80 The heir of St. Augustine's philosophical and theologi- cal thought was St. Bonaventure. It would be easy to cite many passages from writings of the latter that are close in meaning to the theological program of the Torun painting. This panel, and, in fact, the whole Toruni altar, is a universal record of Franciscan thought of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It flourished in the period in question under the potent influence of St. Bonaventure's system, which was, above all, a chris- tocentric one.8' In the creation of such an original rep- resentation as the Toruni Quinity a considerable role was played by biblical exegesis concerned with the spe- cific metaphor of the Epistle to the Hebrews.82 The Toruni altar in its present state of preservation contains a variety of themes. There are evangelical and apocryphal scenes of the life of Christ and the Virgin Mary, hagiographic and devotional images and a single picture whose dogmatic character represents a christo- logical synthesis. This picture corresponds ideologically and formally to the image of Christ among the Doctors in the Temple of Jerusalem (Fig. 8), which most prob- ably was its counterpart in the original arrangement of the altar. The juxtaposition of these two panels cor- responds to the antithesis in the Epistle to the Hebrews of the two Temples. While in the Quinity Christ is shown as the Child on his Father's lap and-in union with God-as the Priest, in the latter, Jesus, also the Child, but already incarnate, appears in the house of his Father. In the gable of the ample Gothic church the bust of God the Father blesses the Son. And Christ himself asserted that when he was teaching he abode in his quae patris mei sunt (Luke 2: 49).
