Haldane is said to have once remarked that God must have an ordi- nate fondness for beetles, given that beetles are among the most speciose of all animal species on the planet (see Gould, 1993). Humans, on the other hand, have an inordinate fondness for pri- mates. While there are 1800 biological anthropolo- gists vying for 209 primate species (Fleagle 1998; American Association of Physical Anthropologists web site, www.physanth.org) there are approxi- mately 6500 entomologists and (conservatively) over a million species of insects (Evans &amp; Bellamy, 1996; Connelley, personal communication, 2002). We have long known that the more human-like the organism, the more likely it is to capture our inter- est (remember that anthropomorphic monkey, Curious George, as a child?). This inquiry-based les- son draws upon our innate interest in ourselves and things like us. "What Is a Primate?" is a series of hands-on experiments that engages students in hypothesis testing and promotes active learning of concepts of evolution and adaptation. Primates are characterized by a suite of features that reflect adaptations to arboreal life (Table 1). Vision and touch are central to this suite of adapta- tions. The more evolutionarily primitive senses, smell and hearing, are not, however. Primates rely on vision and touch together to make critical judg- ments - is it dangerous? edible? something else? As Napier and Napier (1985, p. 34) remarked, "A fruit may look ripe, but, as every wise shopper knows, it mustfeel ripe, too." Object of Lab Exercise The object of this exercise is to demonstrate how features of the hands (acute cutaneous sensi- bility and manual dexterity) and eyes (stereoscopic vision, color vision) distinguish primates from ELIZABETH MCGEE, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences and Science Education at San Jose State University, San Jose, CA 95192-0100; e-mail: emcgee@email.sjsu.edu. 286 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 65, NO.4, APRIL 2003</page><page sequence="2">other mammals. Students test the following hypotheses: 1. Color vision enhances performance. 2. Stereoscopic vision enhances performance. 3. Manual dexterity (particularly the opposable thumb) enhances performance. 4. Cutaneous sensibility enhances performance. 5. The suite of primate characteristics as a whole enhances performance. Students engage in a task (beading) that requires both dexterity and visual acuity. The above hypotheses are tested by restricting these abilities (i.e., acute cuta- neous sensibility, manual dexterity, stereoscopic vision, and/or color vision) while placing beads on a wire under timed conditions. Materials Each student will need the following materials: 1. A mixture of black/white/ gray beads (3 mm in size) in a shallow bowl (about 30 beads total) 2. A mixture of color beads (3 mm in size) in a shallow bowl (about 30 beads total) 3. One piece of wire (34 gauge), about a foot long 4. Latex gloves (without pow- der, if possible) 5. Eye patch plus a couple of small Kim-Wipe? tissues (or any tissue that is not treated with perfume, etc.). The tis- sue is placed between the eye patch and skin. 6. A few pieces of pink "beauti- cian" tape (this tape leaves less adhesive on the skin than ScotchTm tape) 7. A few Wet-Ones? towelettes or something similar (for removing sweat, powder or tape adhesive) 8. Datasheet (see sample in Figure 1). Bags containing about 200 beads can be purchased at hobby or craft stores. Separate out the white, gray, and black. Inexpensive but effective eye patches can be made using elastic string and vinyl pur- chased from a fabric store. The pink tape can be found in beauty supply stores or large drug stores. Each student will need a datasheet. As explained below under Experiment 1, the instruc- tor will need to prepare six differ- ent versions of the datasheet. The Table 1. Traits characterizing the order Primates (Sussman, 1999).This activity tests hypotheses relating to the adaptive value of traits described in numbers 2,3, and 5. 1. Preservation of a generalized limb structure with five fingers or toes on each of the extremities. 2. Freely mobile digits, especially the thumb and big toe (used for grasping). 3. Flattened nails (rather than sharp, compressed claws); this is associated with the devel- opment of highly sensitive tactile pads on the digits. 4. Reduction of olfaction and associated areas of the brain; abbreviation of the snout. 5. Elaboration of the visual apparatus, with development of binocular vision and typically color vision. 6. The loss of certain elements of the primitive mammalian dentition, but the preserva- tion of a simple cusp pattern of the molar teeth and the retention of teeth which are regionally differentiated in form (heterodonty). 7. Expansion and elaboration of the brain, especially the cerebral cortex. 8. Increase and elaboration of the development of the processes of gestation and of the uterine and placental membranes.

Each experiment is timed by the instructor for one minute. Experiment #1 To begin, look at the grid on your data collection sheet (Figure 1). Notice on the left a series of con- ditions (rows A-E) such as "one eye, bare hands," etc. Two more condi- tions appear at the top of the page: black/white/gray (column X) and color (column Y). The first experi- ment will test if color vision enhances your ability to string beads. The outcome of this experi- ment will determine how you test the next 3 hypotheses. Before starting the experiment, answer the following: * What are the factors involved? [stereovision, touch, dexterity, color] * In Experiment 1, which of these factors will be held constant? [stereovision, touch, dexterity] * In Experiment 1, which factor is allowed to vary? [color] We want to make sure that we are not biasing the outcome of this experiment because we are becoming more skilled with practice. How can this be accom- plished? First, your class could do a trial run. Better still, split the class into two randomly determined groups (e.g., those students with birthdays on odd days vs. even days, etc.). For Experiment 1, half the class will string black/white/gray beads first and the other half, color beads first. Then the groups will switch. You will notice in the grid on the datasheet that Roman numer- als are in cells AX and AY (also in EX, but more on this in Experiment 3). These indicate which test you should do first. Half the students will have a roman numeral I in cell AX, while the other half will have Roman numer- al I in cell AY. Procedure 1. Tie a good knot in your beading wire. 2. Determine by the Roman numeral in cell AX or AY if you will string black/white/gray or color beads first. The instructor will time you for one minute while you put as many beads on the wire under the conditions specified. 3. At the end of the minute, count up your beads and record this number in the cell with Roman numeral I. Return the beads to the bowl from which they came. 4. The instructor will now time you for a minute while you put as many beads on the wire under the conditions indicated by Roman numeral II. 5. At the end of the minute, count up your beads and record this number in the cell with Roman numeral II. Return the beads to the bowl from which they came. What's Going On? Do you see a difference in the number of beads you could string under different conditions? More interest- ingly, when we look at the class as a whole, is there a dif- ference? You could compare the average number of color beads and the average number of black/white/gray beads for the class, but this doesn't really tell us if the observed difference (if, indeed, there is a difference) between the two is meaningful. We will use a statistical procedure called the Wilcoxen Matched- Pairs Signed-Ranks Test that compares the difference between two groups of paired data points. The Wilcoxen test is similar to the Student t-test, but is a nonparametric or "distribution free" test that can be per- formed without a calculator or computer. The proce- dure for calculating the Wilcoxen test statistic is given in Box 1. The Wilcoxen test statistic is compared to a Table 2.

Determine the absolute difference between each pair (Column d). 2. Rank the absolute differences; disregard zero differences (i.e., where number of color beads equals the number of black/white/gray beads). In the case of ties (e.g., pairs 5,6 and 9), rank each pailr with the mean of the rank numbers that would have been assigned if they were different. For example, pairs 5, 6, and 9 would have been assigned ranks of 1, 2, and 3 if they were different; since they're not, take the mean of 1, 2, and 3 (X-= 2), and assign th'is number to each of the tied pailrs (Column e). 3. Restore the original signs to the ranked d'ifferences (Column f). 4. Sum ranks with positive signs (W+), then sum ranks with negative signs (W) (Column f). In the above dataset, W+ = 4 and W = 41. 5. Estimate n (the total number of pairs; do not include pairs with zero differences). In the above dataset,n = 9. 6. W+ and W are compared against a critical value obtained from a statistical table for the Wilcoxon T Distribution (McCornack, 1965). The critical values for a two-tailed test at 0.05 are reproduced in Table 2. Reject Ho if either W+ or W is less than or equal to the crit- ical value, W5,,, For the above dataset with n = 9, the critical value W is 5.Therefore, we reject Ho i.e., there is a difference in the number of black/white/gray beads and color beads for the sample. statistical table (an abbreviated table is given in Table 2). Based on your analysis, would you accept or reject the hypothesis that color vision enhances performance? Experiment #2 Refer to your datasheet. If the classes' results from Experiment #1 supported the hypothesis that color enhances performance, then you will use column Y for Experiment #2. Blacken out the cells BX, CX, and DX. If the classes' results from Experiment #1 did not support the hypothesis that color enhances perform- ance, then you will use column X for Experiment #2. Blacken out the cells BY, CY, and DY. Notice in the grid on the datasheet that the cells for WHAT IS A PRIMATE? 289</page><page sequence="5">rows B, C, and D are lettered (column X) and numbered (column Y). Remember, you will use either column X or column Y, depending on the outcome of Experiment #1. Your neighbor's data sheet will have a grid with cells lettered and numbered differently, as will her neighbor, etc. (There are six different versions of this datasheet.) These letters and numbers are indicators of the order in which you perform the next three trials. The random sequence of the lettering across the three different ver- sions of the datasheets ensures that experience doesn't bias the outcome. Note where cell " 1" (or cell "a") is. Read up the col- umn to see if you're working with black/white/gray (cell a) or color beads (cell 1). Then read across the row to see what other conditions you need to set up. Here's a key to the conditions: Gloved hands: Put a glove on the hand that will pick up beads from the bowl. Bare hands: No gloves. Taped fingers: Tape your index and thumb together on the hand that picks up beads. Your hand should now be paw-like - that is, no action from the thumb. One eye: Put an eye patch on. Please use a Kim- wiperm between your eye and the patch. If you wear glasses, put the patch on first and then put your glasses on. Both eyes: No patch. Black/White/ Gray: Use black/white/gray beads. Color: Use color beads. Example: Taped fingers mean you will tape your index and thumb on your beading hand together; you will NOT use an eye patch. Very Important: Every time you take the tape or gloves off, wipe off your hands with the mois- tened towelette. Otherwise, beads will either stick to you or be very slippery for the next experiment! 1. Once everyone has set up his or her conditions, the instructor will time you for one minute while you put as many beads on the wire under the conditions specified. 2. At the end of the minute, count up your beads and record in the appropriate cell how many beads you collected. Return the beads to the bowl from which they came. 3. Now set up conditions that correspond to the cell numbered "2" (or "b"). Repeat until you have tested your beading capabilities under all three conditions specified. We will analyze the data for Experiment #2 with the data for Experiment #3. Experiment #3 The final experiment will test the absence of stereo- vision, touch, dexterity, and color as a single group or suite of characters (i.e., all together, as indicated by cell III in row E, column X). You will compare this to the results for AY (normal). 1. Set up the conditions for EX. After putting on your eye patch, put your glove on first and then tape your fingers. The instructor will time you for one minute while you put as many beads on the wire under these conditions. 2. At the end of the minute, count up your beads and record in cell III how many beads you col- lected. Then, dump the beads back into the bowl with the black/white/gray beads. Table 3.

We will use the Wilcoxen test four times to interpret the data collected. Refer to Table 3 as you prepare the data for analysis. Using your results from the Wilcoxen test, answer the following: 1. Would you accept or reject the hypothesis that stereoscopic vision enhances performance? 2. Would you accept or reject the hypothesis that manual dexterity enhances performance? 3. Would you accept or reject the hypothesis that cutaneous sensibility enhances performance? 4. Would you accept or reject the hypothesis that the suite of primate characteristics as a whole enhances performance? Conclusion Students typically enjoy this lab activity because it is interactive and inclusive. Instructors favor it because it can be easily incorporated into their own curriculum and class schedule. Although this activity was originally designed for a 3-hour university lab experience, it could be broken down into 3 1-hr (or 45 minute) segments. The activity can also serve as a focal point for discus- sions outside the lab on biological diversity, taxonomy, phylogeny, and adaptation. Fleagle (1998) and Sussman (1999) provide detailed but highly readable overviews on these topics. Finally, "What Is a Primate?" is a highly effective introduction to hypothesis testing, particularly if students discover that their results (either individual- ly or as a group) do not support one or more of the hypotheses. "What Is a Primate?" is a question for which there is no hard answer, and this in itself reminds the student that science is a process.
