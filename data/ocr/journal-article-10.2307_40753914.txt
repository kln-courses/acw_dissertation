<plain_text><page sequence="1">DONALD MACDONALD Henry son and Chaucer: Cock and Fox ALTHOUGH THE ACCURACY OF THE DESCRIPTION OF ROBERT HENRYSON as a "Scottish Chaucerian" has only occasionally been disputed,1 discus- sions of Henryson's relationship to Chaucer, with some notable excep- tions,2 have often been more general than specific and have left, I believe, some basic questions incompletely answered. Fundamental to the determination of Chaucer's influence on Henryson is of course the relationship between Troilus and Criseyde and Henryson's parer- gon, the Testament of Cresseid; of no less importance, however, to an understanding of the degree of Henryson's debt to Chaucer, as well as to the Scot's originality as a poet, is the question of Henryson's use of the Nun's Priest's Tale in one of his Moral Fables, the Tale of the Cock and the Fox.3 Comments on the relationship between these two poems have been in some ways curious. On the one hand, although Henryson's use of the Nun's Priest's Tale has often been assumed,4 almost nothing in the way 1 The late Agnes M. Mackenzie (An Historical Survey of Scottish Literature to 1714 [London, 1933], pp. 62-63) asserted that the Scottish Chaucerians are a "myth" and that "Douglas, Dunbar, and even Henryson, are probably less dis- ciples of Chaucer than I am." Most critics, while acknowledging Henryson's in- debtedness to Chaucer, have been concerned at the same time to emphasize his originality and independence. See for example H. S. Bennett, Chaucer and the Fifteenth Century (Oxford, 1947), p. 173; Marshall W. Stearns, Robert Henryson (New York, 1949), pp. 6-7; Scottish Poetry: A Critical Survey, ed.

Smith's discussion (I, xxixff.) of Henry- son's sources for the Moral Fables examines in detail possible borrowings from Walter of England, Lydgate, Caxton, and Petrus Alfonsus but makes no mention of either the Nun's Priest's Tale or the Tale of the Cock and the Fox.</page><page sequence="2">452 DONALD MACDONALD of proof of this assumption has hitherto been offered ;5 on the other hand, Henryson's most recent editor, remarking that the "genealogy [of the Moral Fables] has no real place for Chaucer, while the treatment is un- Chaucerian,"6 appears to suggest that the assumption is mistaken. Since it will be obvious that no accurate estimation of Henryson's debt to Chaucer can be made without knowledge of the relationship between their versions of the same fable material, I have attempted in the follow- ing pages to demonstrate that Henryson had direct knowledge of the Nun's Priest's Tale, to show that Chaucer's version was his principal source for his fable, and to describe in specific terms those elements from the Nun's Priests Tale which Henryson appears to have incorporated into the Tale of the Cock and the Fox. Evidence for Henryson's debt to the Nun's Priest's Tale consists of the fact that a number of elements of Chaucer's version which appear in none of the analogues and which are therefore likely to be original con- tributions by Chaucer are present also in the Tale of the Cock and the Fox. I list these shared elements below, but before consideration of their significance as indications of Henryson's indebtedness to the Nun's Priest's Tale it is necessary to take into account several preliminary possi- bilities: that Henryson, for example, may have derived the shared motifs from some version of the fable intermediate between him and Chaucer; that what have been considered to be original elements in the Nun's Priest's Tale may not in fact be original with Chaucer but may be de- tails contained in a possible lost source, significantly different from the extant analogues, to which Henryson, without knowing the Nun's Priest's Tale, may have had independent access; or that the shared ele- ments that appear in the Tale of the Cock and the Fox may be explained as original contributions to the fable made by Henryson without his knowledge of the Nun's Priest's Tale. The first of these possibilities requires only brief examination, for of the two fable collections that appeared in England in the fifteenth cen- tury Lydgate's does not contain the story of the cock and the fox, and although the tale is included in Caxton's Aesop,1 published in 1484, Caxton's version relates the fable only in its "Aesopic nudity." It con- 5 The only evidence that has ever been adduced in favor of Henryson's use of the Nun's Priest's Tale is contained in a brief passage (pp. 42-43) in A. R. Diebler, Henrisone's Fabeldichtungen (Halle, 1885), in which Diebler notices the presence of the poor widow in both versions and lists six of what he regards as verbal parallels between the two tales. The poor widow is only one, and not the most important, of the elements shared by Chaucer and Henryson, and the verbal parallels are of questionable significance. 6 Elliott, Robert Henryson: Poems, p. x. 7 The Fables of Aesop, ed.

That these parallels may be ex- plained by the use by both poets, independently, of a version of the fable which has since been lost is possible but improbable. Whether Chaucer's source was some version of the tale close to Reinhart Fuchs (as Miss Petersen suggests9) or a version deriving from the Roman de Renart (as Sisam concludes10), such an explanation would require us to postulate the existence of a source which, while associated with one or the other of the epic cycles, differed radically from the extant analogues; it would compel us to assume that elements of the Nun's Priest's Tale which ap- pear to be Chaucer's original contributions were in fact taken from this source; and it would ask us to believe that Henryson, an avowed admirer of Chaucer, obtained these elements not from the Nun's Priest's Tale but from the same putative source. One must recall, of course, that in spite of the fact that very few ex- amples of the fable in Middle English have survived, oral versions of fables were no doubt widely known in England in both the four- teenth and the fifteenth centuries;11 hence the possibility exists that both Chaucer and Henryson knew an oral version of the fable of the cock and the fox that could have supplied some of the details that distinguish their versions from the analogues. But, once more, this possibility, since it does not account for the presence of those elements in both the Nun's Priest's Tale and the Tale of the Cock and the Fox which associate them with the epic versions (for example, the proper names given to cock and hens, the description of the owner of the cock, and the lament of the hens), and particularly since some of the elements that Henryson 8 Diebler supplies no proof for his opinion (Fabeldichtungen, p. 1 1 ) that the CF was written at some time between 1482 and 1484; David A. Crowne, "A Date for the Composition of Henryson's Fables," JEGP, LXI (1962), 583-590, finds no evidence on which to base the date of the composition of the CF. 9 Kate O.

If this is so there remains only the question whether Henryson borrowed elements from the Nun's Priest's Tale or arrived at these details independently and coincidentally in the process of composition of the Tale of the Cock and the Fox. As I think the following analysis will show, the former explanation is to be preferred. Elements which appear in both the Nun's Priest's Tale and in the Tale of the Cock and the Fox, and which are to be found in no other extant version of the fable, may be listed as follows : 1 . The Poor Widow In both the Roman de Renart and Reinhart Fuchs the owner of the cock and the hens is a rich farmer; in both Chaucer and Henryson the owner is a poor widow. If Miss Petersen is correct in her view that this transformation was one of the changes that Chaucer made in the story,12 the appearance of the poor widow in the Tale of the Cock and the Fox would provide substantial evidence of Henryson's debt to the Nun's Priest's Tale; but Sisam's opinion that Chaucer's source was some ver- sion of the tale which had become separated from the Roman and in which, in the process, Constans de Noes had been replaced by his wife as the dominant human figure of the tale,13 seems to me to be persuasive, particularly since early wood-carvings illustrating the pursuit of the fox consistently represent the chase as being conducted by a woman.14 Nevertheless, although Sisam's theory accounts for the predominance of a woman character and for the disappearance of the rich farmer, it does not completely explain why the woman should be, in the first place, a widow, and why, in the second place, she should be poor. Hence the presence of the poor widow as the central human figure in both NPT and CF suggests Henryson's knowledge of the former. 2. The Matter of Names One of the most puzzling features of the NPT is Chaucer's use of names, which is strikingly different from that of the epic versions. He re- 12 Petersen, Sources, pp. 67-68. 13 Sisam, The Nun s Priest's Tale, p. xxvii. 34 In misericords from Ely Cathedral, Boston, Lines., and Beverley Minster, il- lustrated in Sisam (frontispiece, ibid.) the chase is conducted by a woman with a distaff. Chaucer transfers the distaff to Malkyn; Henryson returns it to the widow, who makes her living by "spinning on hir Rok" (v. 412) .</page><page sequence="5">Henryson and Chaucer: Cock and Fox 455 tains the name "Chauntecleer" for the cock, but the fox is called not Renaît but "daun Russell," a curious divergence from the analogues since the fact that the name Reynard was known to Chaucer is proved by its appearance (v. 2448) in the Legend of Good Women, and, in- deed, must have been known in England as early as the thirteenth cen- tury, as its use in the Vox and Wulf indicates. In addition, Chaucer changes the name of the principal hen (Pinte in both the Roman and RF) to Pertelote, he makes no use of the names of the cock's father (Chanteclin in the Roman, Sengelin in RF) that were presumably avail- able to him, and he provides original English names for the dogs that participate in the chase. In his use of names Henryson follows Chaucer's example in every detail. Like his predecessor, he retains one name, that of "Chantecleir." He omits the name of the cock's father. He provides the hens with original names (Pertok, Sprutok, and Toppok), and he gives the pursuing dogs Scots names. Thus, although Henryson's names, with the exception of Chantecleir's, are different from Chaucer's, his procedure in naming the characters in the CF is exactly parallel to Chau- cer's use in the NPT. 3. The Cock's Beauty Neither the Roman nor RF makes mention of the physical appear- ance of the cock, but in the NPT Chauntecleer is the possessor of re- markable beauty, which Chaucer describes in elaborate terms: 15 His coomb was redder than the fyn coral, And batailled as it were a castel wal; His byle was blak, and as the jeet it shoon ; Lyk asure were his legges and his toon; His nayles whitter than the lylye flour, And lyk the burned gold was his colour. VII, 2859-286416 In Henryson, too, the cock's beauty is described in some detail; and al- though for reasons of his own Henryson puts the description of this beauty into the mouth of the fox and although it is briefer than that in the NPT, it resembles Chaucer's in its circumstantiality and in its in- clusion of a number of the same physical features. The fox says: 15 The motif appears briefly in Marie's version (w. 5-6) : "Sire," fet il, "mult te vei bel, Unkes ne vi si gent oisel." Die Fabeln der Marie de France, ed. K. Warnke (Halle, 1898), pp. 198-200. xo Quotations irom the NF1 are from The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, ed. F. N. Robinson, 2nd ed.

The Praise of the Cock's Singing In most versions of the tale the fox's praise of Chauntecleer's singing is an integral part of the "oculis clausis" trick by which the fox succeeds in capturing the cock, and this element is present in both the NPT and the CF. Chaucer's treatment of the cock's singing, however, is signifi- cantly different from that of earlier versions. When Chauntecleer is first introduced at the beginning of the NPT, Chaucer tells us that In al the land, of crowyng nas his peer. His voys was mûrier than the murie orgon On messe-dayes that in the chirche gon. Wei sikerer was his crowyng in his logge Than is a clokke or an abbey orlogge. By nature he knew ech ascencioun Of the equynoxial in thilke toun ; For whan degrees fiftene weren ascended, Thanne crew he, that it myghte nat been amended. VII, 2850-2858 Not only is Chaucer's praise of the cock's crowing much more extensive than that of the analogues but it contains two additional points of es- pecial interest : first, this encomium to the cock's singing does not come from the fox, as it does in the other versions; and, second, it is not only the melodiousness of the cock's singing (as it is in other versions of the fable) but its remarkable accuracy and dependability that is the object of praise. In Henryson's tale, similarly, it is not the fox but Pertok, one of the hens, who praises Chantecleir's crowing, and her appreciation includes not only praise of the beauty of his singing but, like Chaucer's, its de- pendability. Chantecleir was both "our nichtingall," she says, "... and als our Orloge bell, Our walkryfe watche, us for to warne and tell Quhen that Aurora with hir curcheis gray, Put up hir heid betwix the nicht and day." w. 498-501 It is hardly necessary to point out that both Chaucer and Henryson use the same figure of the "orlogge" bell in the same context, and that</page><page sequence="7">Henry son and Chaucer: Cock and Fox 457 Henryson's inclusion of the curious detail of the dependability of the cock's crowing can hardly be explained other than by his knowledge of the NPT. 5. The Fox's Disguise of His Ruse and the Cock's Reaction to the Flattery The essence of the fox's trick, which is central to all versions of the fable, is that the fox describes the cock's father as crowing with his eyes closed and persuades the cock to emulate his father. In versions of the fable other than Chaucer's and Henryson's the fox makes the request that the cock crow with his eyes closed simply and directly, but in both the NPT and the CF the fox conceals the essential matter of the closed eyes by including it as only one of a number of characteristics of the father's crowing that the cock is urged to imitate. Thus in Chaucer, the cock's father, according to the fox, would not only "wynke" as he crowed (the important point) but would also "stonden on his tiptoon" and "strecche forth his nekke long and smal." Similarly, in Henryson, the cock's father, says the fox, would not only close his eyes but would "on his tais stand" and also "turne him thryis about" as he crowed. There is additional similarity, and perhaps a verbal parallel, in the descriptions of the cock's reaction to the fox's appeal. "Ravysshed with his flaterie," the cock in the NPT . . . stood hye upon his toos, Strecchynge his nekke, and heeld his eyen cloos, And gan to crowe loude for the nones. VII, 3331-3333 In Henryson, the cock, "infect with wind and fais vanegloir," first "upon his tais hie, / Kest up his beik," and later: Unwarlie winkand wawland up and doun, . . . syne to chant and craw he maid him boun. w. 477-^78 The verbal resemblance between "stood hye upon his toos" and "upon his tais hie" is probably of less significance than either the inclusion of the detail in both versions or the similarity in the fox's method of con- cealing his real purpose in both Chaucer and Henryson. 6. The Fox's Second Attempt to Beguile the Cock Only in Chaucer and Henryson does the fox attempt to persuade the cock to descend from the tree. Professor Severs makes the suggestion that this detail in the NPT is perhaps a transference by Chaucer of the</page><page sequence="8">458 DONALD MACDONALD unsuccessful attack on the cock made by the fox at the beginning of the Roman version to the end of the tale and that this change may have been made by Chaucer in order to emphasize, by his refusal to come down from the tree, that Chauntecleer has learned his lesson and will never again be beguiled.17 This interpretation, which is consistent with Chaucer's essentially sympathetic depiction of Chauntecleer, provides a reasonable explanation for the presence of this detail in the NPT; it cannot, however, apply to the inclusion of the element in the CF, for Henryson's purpose, unlike Chaucer's, demands that the cock revert to his original role of a vain and gullible fool. Hence, since the narrative logic of the CF does not require the inclusion of this detail, the likelihood is that Henryson borrowed the element from Chaucer. 7. The Reversal of the Concluding Speeches All versions of the fable conclude with moral statements by the cock and the fox. In versions other than Chaucer's and Henryson's the se- quence is as follows: the cock flies to the tree and mocks the fox, the fox complains of the mouth that speaks at the wrong time, and the cock cries shame on one who sleeps when he should be awake. In the NPT and the CF alone the order of these concluding speeches is reversed : the cock flies to the tree, the fox begs him to come down, the cock re- fuses and reproaches himself for being unwary, and the fox blames him- self for his foolishness. The reversal of the usual order is a natural con- sequence of the insertion by Chaucer and Henryson of the fox's attempt to persuade the cock to come down from the tree. The cock's rejection of the fox's appeal concludes appropriately with his speech of self- reproach, emphasizing as it does the finality of his refusal; and the fox's reply, indicating his acceptance of total defeat, ends suitably with his expression of disgust at himself for allowing the cock to trick him. 8. The Digression of the Debate Perhaps more than by any other difference, the NPT is distinguished from all earlier versions of the cock-and-fox story by Chaucer's insertion of the debate between Chauntecleer and Pertelote. Since there can be little question that this digression, which occupies so important a place in the NPT, is one of Chaucer's original contributions to the fable, the appearance of a similar digression in Henryson's version of the tale is of importance as evidence of his indebtedness to the NPT. In the CF, after the cock is stolen and the widow falls into a swoon, the fable is in- 17 J. Burke Severs, "Chaucer's Originality in the Nun's Priest's Tale" SP, XLIII (1946), 40.</page><page sequence="9">Henryson and Chaucer: Cock and Fox 459 terrupted while the three hens fall into a "disputatioun" over the char- acter of their lost lord. Pertok begins the debate with an apostrophe to Chantecleir that in its mock-heroic style would be fully appropriate to Pertelote at the loss of Chauntecleer : " 'Allace,' quod Pertok, makand sair murning, / With teiris grit attour hir cheikis fell ; / 'Yone wes our drowrie, and our dayis darling'." And she continues : "Quha sail our lemman be? quha sail us leid? Quhen we ar sad, quha sail unto us sing? With his sweit Bill he wald brek us the breid, In all this warld wes thair ane kynder thing? In paramouris he wald do us plesing, At his power, as nature did him geif . Now efter him, allace, how sail we leif ?" vv. 502-508 This lament is rudely interrupted by Sprutok, who provides a more realistic estimate of the cock's character; Pertok quickly retracts her praise of Chantecleir and adds her own derogatory opinion of his dis- abilities as .a lover, and the third hen, Toppok, sums up the "debate" by attributing the cock's downfall to his numerous sins. Notice that in both Chaucer and Henryson the following elements appear: the narration of the traditional fable is interrupted by a digression of considerable length, the digression is in content (ostensibly, at least, in the CF) a de- bate between the chickens, and it is mock-heroic in tone. In no less than eight particulars, therefore, the NPT and the CF agree as against all the extant analogues of the fable of the cock and the fox. Of these common elements, any one of several - the dependability of the cock's crowing, the presence of the poor widow, the fox's second at- tempt to beguile the cock, for example - would be enough in itself to suggest that Henryson had direct knowledge of the NPT. Of particular importance as evidence of Henryson's indebtedness, I believe, is his in- sertion into the CF of the debate between the hens, not only because of the points of similarity between this debate and Chauntecleer and Per- telote's argument over the dream, but because this digression is present at all in the CF. In spite of the fact that his habit is normally to expand his sources, Henryson's narrative technique is marked above all by the utmost economy of means. Thus the interruption of the narrative of the fable by the debate between the hens constitutes a striking deviation from his usual practice, a deviation which is made all the more curious by the length of the digression, which occupies seven of the twenty-seven stanzas of the poem, or very nearly a quarter of its length. Although Henryson is too much a conscious artist to be enticed into a lengthy</page><page sequence="10">460 DONALD MAGDONALD digression which has no connection with his theme and although it is true that the hens' debate serves in the CF the function of establishing the unprepossessing character of the cock, an ingredient which is essen- tial to Henryson's purpose, it is almost impossible to believe that when he decided to interrupt his tale with a digression of this length and with so many points of resemblance to the NPT Henryson was not emulating the NPT. Finally, a word should be said about an additional, and important, element which the CF shares with the NPT. It will be recalled that one of the reasons for Miss Petersen's conclusion18 that the NPT derives from a version of the fable that is closer to Reinhart Fuchs than to the Roman is the anthropomorphic treatment of the cock and the hen in both RF and in Chaucer. If this characteristic is of relatively minor im- portance in RF, it is clearly central to the NPT, and there is little exag- geration in saying that in the latter the basic incidents of the fable are almost incidental to Chaucer's mock-heroic description of Chauntecleer and Pertelote. No other element of the NPT, I think, can with more certainty be said to be Chaucer's original contribution to the fable than can the degree to which he depicts the cock and the hen as living human beings, and it is of no small significance, therefore, that the CF is the only version of the fable which rivals the NPT in its anthropomorphic treatment of the animal characters. If in the CF the cock is given, for the most part, only indirect characterization, all three of the voluble hens are worthy descendants of the Wife of Bath in her more critical moods; the fox receives much fuller development in quasi-human terms than does Daun Russell; and the rhetoric of Pertok's lament could have come, as I have said, directly from the NPT. Henryson's consistent ex- pansion of his sources (with the exception of the NPT, already fully expanded by Chaucer) has in fact the primary function of providing room for his anthropomorphic treatment of the animals, a treatment that involves the expansion of the animals' speeches to a degree19 that is matched, in other versions of the fables, only by Chaucer in the NPT. It is true that the serious moral purpose which informs the Moral Fables may be called "un-Chaucerian" and that the corrosive satire of fables like the Tale of the Wolf and the Lamb and the Tale of the Sheep and the Dog is far removed from the gentler irony of the NPT. Never- theless, reminiscences of Chaucer like the cock's high-flown apostrophe 18 Petersen, Sources, pp. 85-86. 19 Generally speaking, as the Nrl would indicate, tne greater me degree or anthropomorphic treatment in an animal tale the more extensive is the use of dialogue. In the Moral Fables a very high proportion of the total number of lines, nearly half, is devoted to passages of dialogue between the animals.</page><page sequence="11">Henry son and Chaucer: Cock and Fox 461 to the jewel in the Tale of the Cock and the Jewel and the fox's expert knowledge of astrology, so much like Chauntecleer's, in the Tale of the Fox and the Wolf are enough to suggest that the Nun's Priest's Tale not only provided Henryson with his principal source for the Tale of the Cock and the Fox but served as his model for other comic tales in the Moral Fables.
