From this perspec- tive, I examine the principle of materiality associated with  UNESCO selection criteria, including a spatial-temporal con- ception that rejects the contemporaneity between objects  and their acts of production. The Malian state’s “heritage  foundation” excludes tourist art carvers on the basis of their  economic survival strategies and marks of identity. In an  opposite perspective, the principle of corporality includes a  social perspective on cultural heritage in which the human  body is viewed as a receptacle of the capital of “social rela- tions of work,” conveying a social aesthetic in which icono- graphic innovation is the outcome of economic precariousness  and hierarchical relations. The question is often raised, in the social sciences, of why the content of  local cultural productions set up as cultural heritage by sovereign states all  follow analogous selection processes and result in similar final products  throughout the world, and by whom and on the basis of what criteria that  “global hierarchy of values” is set (Schramm 2000; Herzfeld 2004). The  debate around the World Heritage List of Masterpieces of Oral and Intangible  Cultural Heritage has pointed up the contradictions inherent in the principle  of classing cultures on the basis of the concepts of “outstanding value” and  “uniqueness” (Nas 2002). Criticism focuses on the economic and national  integration of political stakes as well as on the identity issues (regional- ism, indigenousness, revivalism) to which these concepts are subjected in  everyday life. This principle is based on a material conception of cultural  heritage. After World War II, materiality came to be the main discriminant  in heritagization processes. The destruction worked by the war led to the  heritagization of lieux de mémoire and implied a vision of heritage in terms  </page> <page sequence="3"> of property and collective memory (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 2004).1 Applied  to what is known as movable cultural property, the materialist conception  of heritage aimed at preserving marks of identity (Anico and Peralta 2009)  and dealing with rights of ownership, restitution, theft of ethnographic and  archaeological objects,2 and the architectural and visual character of heritage  advocated by ICOMOS and ICOM.3 The objectivation of cultural productions entailed by the material  definition of heritage has taken the form of a soteriological approach (Stoc- zkowski 2009) in UNESCO policies, underlying the reification of human  action, including the human body. Conversely, more empiricist stances con- sider the human body as both endowed with a capital of “social relations of  work” (Jackson and Palmer-Jones 1999) and as an ontologically independent  entity. Jackson and Palmer-Jones’s definition is particularly enlightening, in  that it characterizes the human body according to its relational strategies  within the framework of production. It connotes the body as a vector and  an actor of social change, but taking the individual approach as the point of  departure. This approach indicates a rather functionalist vision of heritage,  where the principle of conservation underlying the raison d’être of the con- cept of heritage is replaced by a principle of interaction, through a hierar- chical shift from conservation to functionality, from preservation to change  (Loulansky 2006). From this perspective, we are reminded of Jean-Pierre  Warnier’s praxeological interpretation, in which the sensory, emotional, and  motor dimensions of the body are included to obtain a social and ontological  representation of it (Warnier 2001), producing a comprehensive reflection  on the relations among subjectivation, politics, and material culture (Bayart  and Warnier 2004). Taking this interrogation further, and in step with the theme of this  special issue on the contingency of material and symbolic negotiation in rela- tions between the center and the periphery, I propose to view cultural heri- tage as the outcome of acts of production by people engaged in physical work  and developing strategies for economic survival. My analysis includes the  effects of materiality on the process of heritagization, the relations between  the latter and the soaring price of objects, and the conflict between carvers  and political authorities over the portrayal of the Malian cultural heritage.  I aim to show that Bamako’s tourist art carvers are relegated to marginality  because of the gap between the Malian state’s material definition of cultural  heritage and a social dimension interwoven with the physical acts of produc- tion in the context of an urban economy.4 More specifically, I will attempt  to show that the conflict between the state’s policy reifying the cultural  heritage and the interactivity reigning in the day-to-day survival of carvers at  the Maison des Artisans (see below) reveals the power relationship generated  by the monopolistic position of the material definition of cultural heritage  with respect to the corporeal definition of productive acts involved. My  approach fits into the broader perspective of studies on inequality (Englund  2006; Herzfeld 2004; de Sousa Santos 2007) and on the stakes of access to  visibility in the market economy (Ferguson 2006). africatoday 58(3) 42 Bamako’s Woodcarvers as Pariahs of cultural heritage </page> <page sequence="4"> In the first part of the article, I analyze the effects of the visual nature  of materiality and of the reification of the past on the concept of “tangible  heritage,” as well as in the dynamics of the construction of Mali’s cultural  heritage. I show that the latter is part of an economic and cultural negotia- tion, marked by the conditionality of the criteria determining selection as  world heritage as set by the World Heritage Center,5 and by the influence of  the international art market. I then go on to describe the carvers’ conflicts  at various levels of the social scene, such as the workshops, the occupa- tional associations at the Maison des Artisans, and the state. My view of  the context in which Bamako sculptors produce their work as a “space of  emergence” (de Sousa Santos 2002), of creation in fieri, aims at showing,  finally, that the economic and political marginality of woodcarvers at the  Maison des Artisans does not prevent them from being innovative. In fact,  the structural contradiction stemming from the financial stress under which  they work and from the discrepancy between their production and the global  hierarchy of value on the international art market forces these people to  develop strategies for both economic and iconographic adaptation. The Art Market and Heritagization Between 1960 and 1975, ethnographic and archaeological objects, usually  called objects of art, were far from being primary representational elements  for the Malian state, as indicated by the lack of an efficient inventory system  and the many times the National Museum of Mali was moved. UNESCO’s  engagement in a global project for inventorying cultural property resulted in  the 1970 convention,6 marking a turn toward the gradual institutionalization  of national cultural policies. The inventory of the National Museum col- lections, in 1975, the organization of Museum Days in 1976, the UNESCO  project for inventorying Mali’s cultural property in 1981, just when a new  national museum was being built, galvanized discussion on the issue of  cultural property and its circulation on the international market. It was  through the fight against clandestine archaeological digs searching for objects  known as Djenne terracotta, in particular, that Malian cultural policies  came to be institutionalized. While doing archaeological prospecting on the  Djenne-Jeno site in 1977, Roderick McIntosh and Susan Keech uncovered  traces of informal digs on ancient sites—a fact that had actually been known  by scholars since the 1960s (Bedaux et al. 1978; Evrard 1977; McIntosh and  Keech-McIntosh 1979, 1980).7 Dubbed masterpieces by the art market in the 1980s, the Djenne ter- racotta objects were awarded a commercial pedigree, partially due to their  being dated as ranging from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, and  therefore covering the central period of the Malian empire (Panella 2004, in  press). This historical packaging, along with commercial overestimation by  the art market, supplied elements of heritagization to be intertwined with  the national integration policy subsequent to the 1992 presidential elections  africatoday 58(3) 43 Cristiana Panella </page> <page sequence="5"> and the “social peace” policy implemented by the creation of a collective  memory. This approach was intended to blunt the memory of violence of  the March 1991 riots and the Tuareg rebellion, and to build a shared hori- zon, smoothly shifting from past to present (Rowlands 2005). No other sort  of object has been able to replace the representational power conferred on  Djenne terracotta by the international market and adopted by the Malian  national state as the globalized showcase of its cultural heritage, combining  its commercial pedigree and a reified past. In the case of what are known as ethnographic objects, the art market  has once again been in the forefront, catalyzing the construction of a heritage  through circulation of Sudanese sculpture. Henry Hubert, Chief Administra- tor of the Colonies and President of Les Amis des Arts de l’AOF, was one of  the first, in the 1920s, to promote the native arts (arts indigènes) of French  Sudan. Many of the objects exhibited in Dakar in 1923 at the Art at School  exhibit, organized by that society, were displayed at the International Deco- rative Arts Exhibit in Paris, in 1925,8 enriched by pieces displayed by collec- tors Paul Guillaume, Charles Vignier, and Ernest Brummer. The Vincennes  Exhibition (1931) and the Dakar-Djibouti Mission (1931–1933) marked the  onset of commodification of Sudanese sculpture, which turned them into  “African art.” A great many of the objects from French Sudan, Dahomey,  and the Ivory Coast exhibited in Vincennes were sold. Art merchant Charles  Ratton, part of whose collections were displayed at the Permanent Museum  of the Colonies and at the Ethnographic Exhibit of the French Colonies,  acted as auctioneer at Trocadero for three of the six auctions held during the  Vincennes Exhibit (Panella 2002: 88). The synergy between the art market’s criteria and the collection poli- cies of museums led to the increasingly systematic selection of objects by  colonial officials. The concept of “art object,” applied to African sculpture,  was reinforced in the 1950s through the expression plastique africaine  ‘African modeling’, already in use in metropolitan France and employed in  1949 in the Bulletin de l’IFAN (the bulletin of the Institut Fondamental  d’Afrique Noire) during an exhibit organized by the IFAN by Pierre Bardon.  A second exhibit, Plastic Arts of West Africa, was set up in the Information  Hall in Bamako. In 1950, the Bulletin de l’IFAN announced that the IFAN  had acquired the Bédiat collection, composed of 1611 pieces (masks, statu- ettes, weights for gold, etc.), which was put on exhibit. During the 1950s,  the local IFAN centers were increasingly dynamic, and their collections  were enlarged. In 1951, the Abidjan IFAN center organized a new exhibit,  devoted to the “plastic arts and crafts of the Ivory Coast,” containing new  ivory objects and masks. In 1952, the same center acquired 584 more pieces,  along with 720 objects collected by Bohumil Théophile Holas in Khorogo.  The turn of the 1950s marked the beginning of the art market in Bamako  as well, while Sudanese merchants traveled to metropolitan France (Panella  2002: 114–115). africatoday 58(3) 44 Bamako’s Woodcarvers as Pariahs of cultural heritage </page> <page sequence="6"> Colonial Heritage, Economic Dependency, and Innovation:  The Maison des Artisans Soudanais in Bamako The colonial administration viewed the development of a method for sys- tematically collecting and classifying objects as a way of analyzing the trends  in native craftwork and of assessing the impact of supporting projects for  handcrafts. The Maison des Artisans Soudanais, generally known as the Arti- sanat, was inaugurated in Bamako in 1933.9 It first housed the craft fair held  during Bamako’s fiftieth anniversary celebration.10 A hub for dispatching  objects to local fairs and subsequently to the home country’s museums, the  Maison des Artisans clearly shows how the European art market influenced  colonial officials’ taste for African sculpture. The promotion of crafted products from the colonies in France through  selected fairs and the development of tourism (Dulucq 2009) went hand in  hand with the determination to “revive and renovate native art,” especially  sculpture(Letter from the Ligue Coloniale Française to the Governor of  Upper Senegal-Niger,11 The impression that the craftsmanship of Sudanese  sculptors had degenerated was conveyed by Jean Le Gall, former professor  at the School of Applied Arts in Paris and commissioned by the Governor of  the AOF, Jules Brévié, to create a Sudanese Applied Arts Workshop, in his  correspondence.12 In a first report in 1932, Le Gall claimed that the colony’s  craftwork production was declining sharply, and that only the old sculptors  still made high-quality objects, but even they admitted to have lost the skills  they had learned from their fathers. In 1936, an anonymous official wrote  that “the native soul is no longer, can no longer be, and will no longer be  what it was [crossed out]: so it won’t make any primitive Negro art for us  nowadays; that’s something we have to forget” (Panella 2002:99). The grow- ing regimentation of the international art market from the 1970s came in the  wake of the mythicizing of Africa, and therefore of African objects, begun by  Marcel Griaule (Ciarcia 2001; Van Beek 2004). The woodcarvers at the Maison des Artisans seem to be a peripheral  element, then, in the representation first of “Sudanese art” and later of Mali’s  cultural heritage. The marginalization generated by the tendency to exalt the  exotic, inherited from colonialism, is compounded by economic marginal- ization, owing to the difficulty of their access to high-quality raw materials.  The role of economic necessity in so-called arts and crafts (artisanat d’art)  has received little attention by scholars interested in iconographic innova- tion, who mostly focus on the dynamics of cultural brokerage (Graburn  1976; Jules-Rosette 1984; Steiner 1994; Wa Kabwe-Segatti 2009), yet liquid  assets are an unavoidable discriminant factor determining access to visibility  (participation in international fairs, selling abroad, etc.), through purchas- ing first-choice wood, and therefore achieving high-quality production.  Economic hardship has played a major role in the social organization of the  trade. The case of carved ebony objects is a good example of the financial  constraints tied to the production and sale of tourist art. The costliness  of items in ebony stems from the time required to carve such hard wood.  africatoday 58(3) 45 Cristiana Panella </page> <page sequence="7"> The “remodeling” of a Bamana motherhood (Bobolibugu market, Bamako,  1996) Ebony Tyi-Wara headpieces, for instance, are always small because prices for  them (in 1997) started at 15,000 CFA francs (FCFA) for a 50-centimeter-high  headpiece, the size most appreciated by tourists.13 Carvers making Tyi-Wara  usually use kapok wood, or bumu (Bombax costatum), an inexpensive wood,  also used for household items and toys.14 The cost of transportation is the  ultimate barrier for carvers with low earnings. For example, the transporta- tion of stylized figures known as skeletons is delicate and not very profit- able. It took 550,000 FCFA, in 1997, to ship 300 kilograms of wares, plus an  additional 15 to 20 percent for customs. Financial handicaps have repercussions on the iconography of sculp- tures, as well as on the channels for selling them. To manage supply prob- lems (little access to first-class wood) and deal with the shrinking market  for finished objects, craftspeople rework and transform their unsold pieces.  In 1996, a carver on the Bobolibugu market who was unable to purchase  enough wood to make new pieces reworked his Bamana motherhood  statuettes to turn them into Dogon motherhood statuettes. This shortcut  africatoday 58(3) 46 Bamako’s Woodcarvers as Pariahs of cultural heritage </page> <page sequence="8"> A view of the wealthy master carver Kabiné Doumbia’s atelier (Maison des  Artisans, Bamako, 1997) enabled him to save time, so he could work on other orders and economize  on the price of wood. Carvers at the Bobolibugu market constitute a telling  example of “small-scale commercial production” with no accumulation  of capital (Amselle and Le Bris 1980). In this type of production, we find  the lowest strata of craftspeople, composed of apprentices and first-level  carvers who were paid day rates ranging, in 1997, from 500 to 1000 FCFA.  Often people in these occupational categories have no regular income, and  their daily earnings go to household expenses and to finance their activity  (Panella 2002). In addition to economic necessity, the hierarchical struc- ture of woodcarving workshops sets up barriers, leaving individuals little  leeway (Herzfeld 2004; Viti 2005). Since they can hardly accumulate any  money, most carvers at the Maison des Artisans are obliged to spend most  of their time on chain-line production for tourists, such as small masks  known as maraka (sogow) ‘marriage portraits’ (man and woman standing  side by side), colons, Dogon and Bamana-style masks and statuettes, and  ebony penseurs ‘thinkers’ and squelettes ‘skeletons’. This bread-and-butter  production remains marginal with respect to both the so-called traditional  sculpture fashioned by international auctions, and contemporary work, and  integrated in the globalized art circuits at various levels, such as local and  international fairs and international contemporary art exhibits (Enwezor  and Okeke-Agulu, 2009). africatoday 58(3) 47 Cristiana Panella </page> <page sequence="9"> Economic Discrimination and Access to Visibility:  Power Relations in the Handicraft Arena In the mid-1990s, the rehabilitation of Bamako’s Maison des Artisans facili- ties generated a real fight for the stands, between merchants and carvers, and  master carvers and apprentices. Whereas the intention of the Management  Committee of the Maison des Artisans was to assign the stands to master  carvers who had demonstrated their skills, most stands ultimately went to  wealthy merchants.15 The criteria for awarding stands were viewed by carv- ers unable to accumulate capital16 as an attempt to exclude the least affluent  for the benefit of the well-to-do, usually merchants.17 The high taxes and  rental prices for workshops excluded carvers. These outcasts, or weak links  on the Bamako handicraft scene, relegated to the peripheral neighborhoods  of Djikoroni-Para and Banconi, often make copies or imitation aged copies  of ancient pieces, which feed the traders with stands at the artisanat. Conse- quently, many of Bamako’s carvers and small vendors set up their workplace  in their home, and sell their work to the standkeepers at the artisanat, or to  master carvers with connections to the city’s antique dealers. Relations between neighborhood carvers and merchants or master  carvers are often paralyzed by the prerogatives of power and the management  of the artisanat stands. According to Lamine Diallo, in 1997 the number of  woodcarving stands rose from four to twelve, but that is still insufficient;  designed for six artisans, some stands are used by ten to fifteen carvers.18  Shopkeepers who receive stands leave no room for carvers, who consider  themselves more legitimate than the former and resent the unfair treatment.  Carvers from Banconi and Djikoroni Para are convinced that if they stopped  working, there would be nothing to sell at the artisanat—indicating that there  are more salespeople than carvers, whereas the intention of the Management  Committee was to reserve the stands for craftspeople, not merchants. The repeated tension during stand assignment is evidenced in the  relations between carvers and the administration. The former complain  that they are underrepresented at the Ministry of Crafts and Tourism, in  comparison with categories such as shoemakers, popular at local and met- ropolitan fairs since colonial times, and jewelers, backed by the National  Office of Geology and Mines.19 Shoemakers and jewelers undeniably receive  more attention from the administration. In 1997, jewelry and leather goods  were chosen, along with textiles, to represent Mali’s craftwork abroad.20  Faced with economic hardship, carvers therefore give priority to immediate,  low earnings over long-term investment through a structured cooperative  network. Among the thirty-three artisans’ associations in Bamako District,  the carvers’ association had only thirty members, and all were from the  Bamako Maison des Artisans.21 Furthermore, the training courses given by  the National Committee for the Promotion of Crafts Work (CNPA) were  disdained by carvers, who usually preferred to relinquish them, rather than  lose a few days’ earnings, the outcome being that young apprentices learned  next to nothing, and production was poorly finished.22 africatoday 58(3) 48 Bamako’s Woodcarvers as Pariahs of cultural heritage </page> <page sequence="10"> In the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Crafts promised to extend loans to  woodcarvers; however, only 52 percent of loans were reimbursed, so that  carvers had trouble taking out bank loans thereafter. The ministry then made  an attempt to find a more collaborative solution, organizing a meeting on  self-management including three representatives of the administration and  three artisans. The outcome was financing for the creation of a credit fund,  backed by the associations. According to a Ministry of Crafts report dating  back to 1995, 45 percent of the loans were not repaid. A second attempt  was the funding of neighborhood credit fund: 15 million FCFA loaned, 2.5  million reimbursed. The ministry then suspended the loans, triggering  immediate reactions from carvers. The priority was, and still is, to ensure  high-quality work (well finished, good price/quality ratio) and to enable  self-management.23 To regulate businesses, the Malian government set up an Office of  Business Formalities, charged with inspecting and filtering import–export  activities. Only then did registration of the professional groups begin—which  incidentally enabled many of the city’s antique dealers to register as brokers  for import–export companies, making it easier for them to travel abroad.  Artisans, and woodcarvers in particular, who had no professional group, felt  marginalized by this arrangement; howsoever innovative, the new regula- tions were difficult to apply, especially with respect to carvers’ participa- tion in international fairs. Artisans were often prevented from traveling by  bureaucratic hindrances. Sometimes funds were handed out only late in the  day, whereas they had planned to leave for the fair in the morning; also, the  carvers were not always informed in time and therefore could not plan to  participate in the fair.24 Some carvers suspected the authorities of refusing  to deliver visas out of fear that they would take advantage of their stay in  Europe or the United States to establish themselves there. Materiality, Corporeity, and Cultural Heritage:  Epistemologies of Social Inequality The factors behind the social and economic invisibility of woodcarvers from  Bamako’s Maison des Artisans and the subsequent hierarchic relations are  realities shared by craftworkers in widely varying contexts within the frame- work of the globalization of markets (Argenti 2002; Scrase 2003; Herzfeld  2004; Elyachar 2005; Solinas 2007). Michael Herzfeld, in his analysis of the  relations between corporeity as everyday acts, objects, and representation  in the making of cultural heritage by the Greek state, portrays the artisans  of Rethymnon, Crete, as troublesome heirs of the national heritage. The  Western collective imaginary and the Greek state’s cultural politics have  turned industrial copies of Attic-era vases into a national cultural heritage,  because they tend to be extremely evocative. Conversely, the handmade  iron gates decorating houses in Rethymnon are viewed as anonymous,  antitechnological handiwork. In other words, the state-operated selection is  africatoday 58(3) 49 Cristiana Panella </page> <page sequence="11"> based on the cultural clichés prevailing in European countries nostalgic for  the rigidified, exportable values of πλισ, as opposed to the impolitic bodies  of artisans, those living remains of ordinary physical masculinity (Herzfeld  2004). Whereas the monumentalization process is grounded in a superposi- tion of object and objectivization, the live body of homo faber and its pro- ductive acts are not viewed as part of the material culture, and are therefore  ostracized from heritagization spheres. The human body is considered an  active subject only when it is decorporealized and reduced to the human  right to save man’s bodily existence—when he/she is physically threatened  with disappearance, or has actually disappeared. This produces a “heritage,”  when he loses his corporeal form, viewed as an obstacle to the reification of  his productive acts, thus following the same reification process as for objects. The dynamics presiding over the selection and exclusion of artisans,  as described by Herzfeld, reflect the paradox facing Malian carvers, faced  with the pressure of cultural heritage anchored in the collective imagina- tion through the magic tricks of the art market and considered as a cultural  gradient. Like the artisans of Rethymnon, today’s Malian carvers may be  seen as marginalized actors within systems for constructing a national cul- tural heritage, as well as in urbanization processes. The resulting economic  and symbolic impoverishment is particularly evident in comparisons with  categories (goldsmiths, weavers, shoemakers) that have always been more  visible for the social and economic power networks (ministries, banks,  associations) ever since the colonial period.25 As values grow increasingly homogeneous, Bamako’s woodcarvers are  becoming the antiheroes of the national cultural heritage, because they are  foreign both to the criteria of “outstanding value” and of “monumentaliza- tion of the past” (Herzfeld 2004) and to the ethno-chic conveyed by world  music and ethnic cuisine. These people do not exist as creators/actors of  cultural heritage, since their production is not considered of the sort that  gives access, at the standardized international level, to the heritage category,  be it what is known as African art or tribal art. Their production is neither  a monumentalization of the past, as represented by traditional woodcarv- ing, ancient terracotta statuettes, or Islamic architecture,26 nor does it carry  the globalized messages of contemporary Malian art as exemplified by the  Mali Kow exhibit.27 Not only does their production lack visibility, but their  status lacks the charisma of sculptors/blacksmiths.28 Being disconnected  from the dynamics of transmission of the local skills connected with their  status, which is to say the forge and command of the occult, gold, and ritual  sculpture, these heritage-producing workers cannot be recycled into the  UNESCO category of “living human treasures” either.29 Like the Rethymnon artisans, the tourist art carvers of Bamako meet  none of the criteria for eligibility to the globalized hierarchy of values:  uniqueness, exceptionality, and international exportability. The reifica- tion process is hindered by the visibility of the actual work in the finished  product. These carvers therefore remain marginalized actors, both for the  systems that construct the national cultural heritage and for the urban  africatoday 58(3) 50 Bamako’s Woodcarvers as Pariahs of cultural heritage </page> <page sequence="12"> economy’s wealth accumulation networks. Lack of consideration for their  work as material culture excludes these workers from modernity’s systems  of representation.30 The processes producing social inequality, entwined in the conflict  between Mali’s administration and the Maison des Artisans woodcarvers  coalesce, then, around the split over management of the temporal dimension  and its exploitation to obtain access to visibility. On the one hand, there is  the representation of time involved in the reification process (monumen- talization of the past, of objects, of people), and on the other hand the mea- surement of time through its breakdown into phases of production (social  organization of the trade, family economy, innovation). These acceptations  and uses of time are reflected in the types of objects with which they are  connected. Monumentalization of the past requires the set iconology of the  found object, whereas serial production and its potential for innovation  take place in real time, in a cause-and-effect relationship between acts and  production. Conclusion The case of Bamako’s Maison des Artisans woodcarvers may be seen as an  example of how acts of production are devalued by the reification process  affecting human actions and relations (Kopytoff 1986; Pels, Heterington,  and Vandenberghe 2002). In this article, I have attempted to show that the  gap between the carvers’ actual physical acts of production and the material  conception of heritage is due to the creation of an exportable national Malian  heritage through the processes of reification and fetishization, fashioned by  the trade in ethnographic and archaeological objects from sub-Saharan Africa.  Although Jean-Louis Luxen, former Secretary General of ICOMOS, alleges  the distinction between “tangible heritage” and “intangible heritage” to be  “specious” (Luxen 2003), the label of cultural property is still awarded on  the basis of criteria clearly separating the material and ontological spheres.  Thus, in spite of the trend, in the social sciences, to “deterritorialize” cul- tures (Appadurai 2001; Inda and Rosaldo 2002) and ascribe a social valence  to objects (Mahon 2000; Geismar and Horst 2004; Glass 2004), the defini- tion of a heritage still conveys the paradox by which societies are viewed  through the classification, simultaneously with the decorporealization, of  their productive acts. In Mali, and in all African countries where the international art market  has created an African art,31 the cultural gradient revealing the Western  social imaginary is directly proportional to the commercial value of African  objects and the evocative power of their pedigree. The social representation  of Bamako’s Maison des Artisans woodcarvers has been affected by the tre- mendous representational power of the mercantile aesthetic criteria govern- ing the circulation of African art. These criteria are bolstered by a concep- tion of space/time in which acts of production, relegated to the antimodern  africatoday 58(3) 51 Cristiana Panella </page> <page sequence="13"> physical acts of carvers, are denied any contemporaneity with the products/ works themselves, inscribed in the sphere of representation. The processes  by which Malian sculptors are selected or excluded thus reflect the paradox  of artisans faced with the weight of a cultural heritage rooted in the col- lective imagination through the art market, whose evaluatory criteria are  elevated to the rank of cultural values. Conversely, when productive acts  performed within strategies for adjustment to change are viewed as a cul- tural heritage, there is no longer any need to define a scale of values through  a material and immaterial dimension of societal productions. The survival  strategies developed by these carvers do not exclude the esthetic dimension  of cultural production; however, these strategies do refer to a social esthetic  that derives its changing, innovative iconographic elements from the eco- nomic necessities transforming reproductive strategies into implements for  iconographic innovation and social change. aCKnOWleDGMents i am most grateful to the editors of Africa Today, who were extremely generous with their time  and attention, and to two anonymous referees for their comments on this article. nOtes 1. the same categories are presently used by iCOMOs, an international organization inspired by  the 1964 Venice Charter for the Conservation and restoration of Monuments and sites (http:// www.international.icomos.org). 2. the Hague Convention (1954), UnesCO Convention (1970), and Unidroit Convention (1995). 3. iCOM (international Council of Museums) is a nongovernmental organization connected  with UnesCO. 4. the data discussed in this article were collected during one of my PhD fieldwork trips (Decem- ber 1996–October 1997) (Panella 2002). two preliminary versions of the present article were  delivered at the colloquium “Prospettive di studi africanistici in italia: Convegno in memoria  di Bernardo Bernardi” (University of rome i, la sapienza, 6–8 March 2009) and at the third  international aeGis conference (leipzig, 4–7 July 2009). i am grateful to Danielle de lame  for her remarks on the leipzig communication. i published a partial version of this article in  italian. see C.
