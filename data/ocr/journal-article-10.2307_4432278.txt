This study deads with the largest subgroup of similes in the Homeric poems, the lion similes, of which there are 50 instances. More in particular, the author focuses on the lion similes in the aristeiai of Diomedes, Agamemnon, Hector, and Achilles in the Iliad. The main issues discussed are: 1) the typology of the lion simile, 2) the interaction between simile and narrative context, and 3) the thematic function of the lion similes. The book resembles C. Moulton's Similes in the Homeric Poems (G?ttingen 1977), perhaps the most important contribution to the study of the Homeric simile since Fraenkel's Die homerischen Gleichnisse of 1921. Lonsdale does not, however, match the clarity of disposition, persuasiveness and interpretative richness of Moulton's book. The analysis which Lonsdale gives on p. 80 of two lion similes in Iliad 17 (60-69 and 108-113) may give an impression of the kind of observations he has to offer. He points out that the comparison of Menelaus to a lion devouring a cow ( = the first simile) forms a "violent reversal of the opening simile at 4ff., where he is likened to a cow standing over her first-born calf ' ; then notes that whereas in the first simile the herdsmen ( = Trojans) did not dare attack the lion ( = Menelaus), in the second one the lion himself has become scared; finally he remarks that the second simile "emphasizes the reluctance with which Menelaos must abandon the body". This is all true, but there is nothing here what a careful reader of the passages might not have detected him-/herself quite easily. One misses the unexpected eye-opener, the superior aper?u. More rewarding is LonsdaJe's discussion of linguistic interaction between simile and context: the appearance of anthropomorphic vocabulary in the animal simile, and of theriomorphic vocabulary in the turnan' context. An example of the first form of linguistic interaction is found in: o? d' ?? t' a???p??? ?a??????e? ???????e??a? p?t?? ?f' ????? ?e???a ??????te ?????ta?, ?? ?? ?e??????te? ?p' ???????s?? d???sa?. (//. 16.428-30) The word ?????ta? is properly a military term belonging to the world of human beings. An example of the second form is found in: a?t??a d' ?? ????? s?? te??es?? ??t? ?a?a?e (//. 3.29): "The verb ??t? ... carries over the image of the lion by suggesting a further Mnemosyne, Vol. XLVI, Fase. 3 (1993)</page><page sequence="2">DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA 397 comparison between Menelaos' leap from the chariot and the leap of a lion." (p. 50). This second example may also serve to make clear the weakness of Lonsdale's approach: he doesn't indicate why ??t? should typically suggest the leap of a lion. Line 29 recurs ver- batim four times, without a lion to be seen in the neighbourhood; the verb a????a? is used in fact mainly of humans, occasionally of other animals, e.g. birds. Similarly, I doubt whether in an expres- sion like ???? pep????? we should speak of the "attributing of anthropomorphic states" to lion or boar (p. 71). Rather, the fre- quent comparison s?? e??e??? ????? would suggest that a??? is a typically animal force (cf. also the Lexikon des fr?hgriechischen Epos s.v., p. 495: "haupts?chlich von L?wen und Ebern gebraucht"). One would have liked the author to provide his reader with more information concerning these matters, here and at many other occasions. Nevertheless, Lonsdale here has opened up a rich field for future research. On pp. 122-5 Lonsdale suggests that similes may have a paradigmatic function. The examples he discusses (//. 11.414ff., 12.146ff., and 13.471ff.), however, all occur in narrator-text, which means that they reach the hearer/reader only, not the heroes in the story. Thus it is impossible that a hero would be exhorted by a boar simile "to unleash his anger against his opponent". I conclude that this book gives us the complete lion (and boar) dossier, without, however, fully exploiting its content. There are some typing errors where numbers are concerned: e.g. on p. 50 (329, instead of 29) and 143 (110.297, instead of 10.297; 2.293 instead of 12.293). Amsterdam, Irene J.
