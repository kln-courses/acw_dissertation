<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS DR. FRANK A. BEACH DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR, AMERICAN MusEum OF NATURAL HISTORY PRESENT-DAY understanding of animal play is regret- tably limited, and current views on the subject are con- siderably confused. On the one hand, there are the hundreds of observations made by naturalists, by animal breeders and by nearly every one who has kept a house- hold pet to indicate that animals of many species do exhibit various types of behavior which, if they were observed in humans, would undoubtedly be called play. On the other hand stands our undeniable ignorance as to the essential nature of play, its causes and its results. The richness of the observational evidence is in sharp contrast to the poverty of scientific knowledge. It is significant that authors of several recent American text-books on comparative or physiological psychology have failed to make any mention of play in animals, or have skipped over the subject as lightly as possible (War- den, Jenkins and Warner, 1936; Maier and Schneirla, 1935; C. T. Morgan, 1943). Their reluctance or inability to treat the topic undoubtedly derives from the exclu- sively observational character of available data and the obvious inadequacy of existing interpretations. It is not the purpose of this paper to present new data pertinent to the problem under consideration, or to pro- pose any original, all-inclusive theoretical interpretation. Instead it is hoped that a survey of existing knowledge and an evaluation of the theories presently available may point the way toward profitable lines of future work which will lead to a more complete understanding of the subject. COMMONLY ACCEPTED CHARACTERISTICS OF PLAY Play is generally regarded as differing from non-play- ful activities in several ways. Whether or not it is pos- sible to discern any pervasive characteristics common to all forms of behavior which are commonly listed under this rubric depends upon the definition of play. At this 523</page><page sequence="2">524 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX point, however, we shall overlook this source of difficulty and list the outstanding characteristics of playful be- havior as set forth by most students of the subject. (1) It is commonly stated or implied, although it can not be objectively demonstrated, that playful behavior in animals as in man carries an emotional element of pleasure. Not all pleasant activities are playful; but all play is assumed to be pleasurable. (2) Play is usually regarded as characteristic of the immature animal rather than the adult. Grown individuals may play; but they do so less frequently than juvenile members of their spe- cies. (3) It is usually supposed that play differs from non-playful responses in having no relatively immediate biological result which affects the continued existence of the individual or the species. In other words, play is customarily regarded as non-utilitarian. (4) The out- ward forms of play are relatively species-specific. Dogs play in certain ways, horses in others, and apes in still others. (5) The amount, duration and diversity of play in a given species is related to its phylogenetic position. In general, play is more frequent, more variable, and occurs during a longer portion of the life span in higher animals than in lower. The play of fishes appears in- frequent and stereotyped when compared with that of lower mammals; while the play of dogs is less diversified and prolonged than that of monkeys and apes. TYPES OF BEHAVIORI WHICH HAVE BEEN CALLED PLAY A wide variety of animal responses are frequently lumped together under the general heading of play. The categories are not clear cut, but may merge insensibly one into another; and sometimes several kinds of play may be combined in an integrated series of reactions. In listing the main types of play we shall temporarily re- frain from any evaluation of the validity of the classifi- cation. General bodily activity. Many young animals display a great deal of bodily activity, chiefly of a locomotor char- acter, in which vast amounts of energy are expended and no obviously useful result is achieved. Fishes of some</page><page sequence="3">No. 785] CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS 525 species periodically leap above the surface of the water; some birds indulge in elaborate aerial acrobatics; colts gallop about the pasture; puppies race back and forth in the yard; kittens scamper wildly across the room over the sofa and under the chair; in addition to climbing, sliding and jumping, chimpanzees execute complicated bodily actions such as turning somersaults, or revolving rapidly in pinwheel fashion while lying at full length on the ground ( -Kohler, 1931). Some writers regard these reactions as a form of play (Mitchell, 1912; Haigis, 1941; Gudger, 1944). Youthful practice of adult activities. Young animals of many species exhibit various behaviorpatterns which also appear in the repertoire of the adult individual; but when executed during immaturity the responses are often incomplete, and seem to lack any practical outcome. Well-known examples of such behavior, which is gen- erally interpreted as play, are the mock battles of pup- pies, the pursuit and capture of any small, moving object by kittens and the infantile or juvenile sex reactions of many species (Groos, 1898). Exploration and experimentation. Responses falling in this category may range from very simple investiga- tory reactions to highly complex and original types of experimentation (C. L. Morgan, 1900). The tendency of young birds and mammals to peck, scratch, claw, pull and bite at objects in their environment is illustrative of the relatively simple exploratory reactions which some observers regard as play. In contrast stand the knot- tying and pole vaulting of chimpanzees, which are also examples of manipulative or experim ental behavior albeit of a higher order. Social responses. Certain inter-individual reactions which seem to lack any practical outcome are often listed as play. The "tilting matches" of young British warb- lers (Pycraft, 1912)," king-of-the-mountain" games of lion cubs (Cooper, 1942), "follow-the-leader" games of young monkeys (C. L. Morgan, 1900) fall in this general category.</page><page sequence="4">526 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX Social play is prominent among chimpanzees accord- ing to the descriptions of Kohler (1931). He states that when several young apes were given a large sack, one crept into the container and the others pulled it about on the ground. Small chimpanzees sometimes rode pick- aback on the shoulders of older animals and then slid downward, grasping the bearer 's trunk with the hind legs and walking on the ground with the hands. The "dancing" of young apes would probably come under the heading of social play. This activity is highly variable and ranges from. spinning round and round in a solo performance to participation in rather complicated group performances. Several chimpanzees may start to march single file around a post or box. Gradually their pace increases and they trot, often with emphasis upon one foot so that a primitive kind of rhythm emerges; and as they trot and stamp, the animals may wag their heads in time with the pedal rhythm. A direct quotation from Kohler will serve to illustrate the complexity and group character of the behavior. As the whole group were joyously trotting round a box, little Konsul stepped to one side outside the circle, drew himself up to his full height, swung his arms to and fro in time to the trottillg, ald each time that fat Tschego passed him, caught her a sounding smack behind. Inter-species reactions. Although animals of one spe- cies occasionally respond to those of a foreign species in what might be regarded as a playful manner, play be- tween species is not common. The outstanding exception to this generalization is the play which takes place be- tween man and his pets. If one is to accept any of the characteristics or criteria of play which are accorded com- mon usage, it must be admitted that the dog plays with his master (Russell, 1936). The animal may engage in sham hunts or battles with the man in much the same manner as with another dog. On the other hand he may with equal readiness participate in a "learned" game such as "fetch," or perform various tricks without any material reward. It is particularly significant to note that the animal may take the initiative in beginning the interspecies play, and signalize in a variety of ways his</page><page sequence="5">No. 785] CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS 527 eagerness to tease his master into a game. In similar fashion young chimpanzees play with human companions (Wolfe, 1936); and the desire to do so is so strong that opportunity to play has successfully been used as an in- centive in certain learning experiments (Yerkes and Petrunkevitch, 1925). CRITERIA AND CAUSES The majority of interpretations purporting to define or explain play are speculative in nature, deductively de- rived and completely untested. Surplus energy. The poet Schiller is reputed to have suggested that play is an expression of overflowing energy which can find no other outlet. Actually, as Curti (1930) has pointed out, Schiller merely noted that play- ful behavior usually occurs when an ample supply of energy is available; but later writers have reinterpreted the original suggestion to form a theory stating that cer- tain types of play constitute a release of extra physical, and perhaps mental or emotional energy. A variation of this hypothesis, in modern dress, has been restated by Tolman (1932) in the suggestion that men and perhaps some of the lower animals have a need under certain conditions to achieve "mild harmonious fatigues." It is proposed that when the organism is in a "neutral sort of metabolic condition," and other needs or appetites are not strongly engaged, there is a condi- tion of unspent energy. This state is regarded as one of physiological disequilibrium requiring complementary fatigue for neutralization. In defining play, Tinklepaugh (1942) states as one criterion the fact that play is a type of activity which occurs under conditions of surplus time and energy. Suggestions of this sort have little to recommend them. In the first place they are based upon the most. obvious sort of circular reasoning. The catch lies in the defini- tion of the term "'surplus." When a cat chases, catches and devours a mouse, a certain amount of energy is ex- pended; but no one suggests that this is extra, or surplus energy. Now, when the same cat chases, catches and</page><page sequence="6">528 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX chews on a rubber ball, an equal energy loss may occur; but in this case it is said to be surplus energy which has been released. Catching and eating mice is serious busi- ness for the cat (or at least the human observer thinks that it should be) ; whereas pursuit of a rubber ball serves no obvious, immediate and practical end (in so far as the observer can tell). Therefore ball chasing must be play, whereas mouse chasing is not play. Refraining' for the moment from commenting upon the anthropomorphic reasoning involved, we can see that the decision as to whether or not the expended energy is surplus energy, de- pends upon the interpretation of the behavior as playful or serious. Therefore to set up as one criterion or ex- planation of play the condition that it involves the release of surplus energy is to do no more than complete the circle. As far as mental and emotional energy are concerned, our concepts in this field are so fuzzy and debatable that it is sheer nonsense to predicate explanations of behavior upon the supposed accumulation and discharge of these hypothetical forces. Definition of one unknown in terms of a second unknown is good algebra but poor psychology. Present-day knowledge of physiology does not support the belief that physical energy is something which can be stored up in the organism like water in a reservoir. There is no known process whereby unexpended energy "backs up" and creates a pressure, demanding release. To be sure certain sources of potential energy, such as liver glycogen, may be accumulated; but this is quite a different matter; and, thus far at least, no one has sug- gested that play occurs because the liver feels the need of discharging stored glycogen. Instead of referring to energy, surplus or otherwise, it seems best to conceive of a muscle, nervous unit or organ- ism as being either completely rested and ready to re- spond maximally to stimulation, or as being. partially or almost completely exhausted, in need of rest and repair. Under conditions of partial or total exhaustion the or- ganism may be expected to react weakly, incompletely, or to fail entirely to respond to stimuli from the external</page><page sequence="7">No. 785] CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS 529 environment. Such a concept would lead us to antici- pate that play, which, like any other type of behavior, con- stitutes a response to stimulation, would occur most fre- quently and readily when the animal is rested and in a state of readiness to react. This is exactly what hap- pens; but be it noted that non-playful activities also occur most frequently under the same conditions. Thus, the tired animal is less apt to play than is his rested fellow; but he is equally less likely to "work." Several writers, including Mitchell (1912), have ob- jected to the interpretation of playful activities as the mere discharge of a waste product; and have insisted that the energy employed in play is expended upon "the business of youth." C. L. Morgan (1900) also states that "normal" rather than surplus" energy is involved in the play of animals. Finally, as Groos (1898) and others have observed, superabundant energy is not always a condition of play. Young animals can often be seen to play to the point of apparent exhaustion, lie panting with fatigue, and sud- denly respond to the advent of a play-inducing stimulus with the abrupt resumption of their energy-draining games. It is generally recognized that young animals are often more active than adult members of their species (Cooper, 1942), and perhaps the observation of this difference has given illusory support to the surplus energy criterion of play. General exuberance or joie-de-vivre. It is often stated that playful behavior is "enjoyed for purely its own sake" (Tinklepaugh, 1942), "expresses a joy of living" or manifests a general exuberance" (Pycraft, 1912). Some writers combine this criterion with the surplus energy criterion, and conclude that play grows out of a pleasure in being active (Haigis, 1941). From this point it is but a step to the conclusion that animals play because playing is pleasant. Before criticizing this theory let us state unequivocably that the comparative psychologist does not look upon all animals other than man as machines which automatically</page><page sequence="8">530 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX carry out their life functions without intelligence, with- out conscious purposes and without any emotional in- volvement. On the contrary, many if not all of the lower mammals, the birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes mani- fest varying degrees of intelligence and adaptability. To be sure, their behavior is less variable than that of man, and their ability to profit from experience may be rela- tively limited; but many observers believe that the dif- ferences are more of degree than of kind. There is, furthermore, little reason to deny to animals various kinds and degrees of emotional experience. Accord- ingly, the most militant and objective "behaviorist" can not seriously object to the statement that the dog which romps through the snow, barking, leaping, dashing wildly hither and yon, or plays at "fetch" with his master, is enjoying the experience. Having *done our feeble best to disarm the critical reader who promptly and scornfully cries, " Mechanist!" at any one daring to speak out against anthropomorphic interpretations of animal behavior, let us proceed to ex- amine the purported explanation of animal play as a form of activity which is engaged in solely for the plea- sure it brings the performer. The first and most obvious objection is that this so- called interpretation does not interpret nor explain. It is directly comparable to the explanations of sixteenth century theologicians who interpreted all natural phe- nomena as manifestations of divine Will, or to the animal- istic beliefs of more ancient "explainers." One might with equal accuracy state categorically that a plant grows toward the sun, a cloud moves across the sky or a stick floats on the surface of the stream, because the plant, the cloud and the stick derive pleasure from behaving as they do. Here is no explanation, no advance in the under- standing of basic causal relationships responsible for the outward activity. Explaining a playful response by referring its occur- rence to one (assumed) character common to all forms of play is equivalent to explaining that water boils be- cause it is hot. To be sure, boiling water is usually quite</page><page sequence="9">No. 785] CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS 531 hot (although its temperature may vary considerably as any tenderfoot who has tried to cook at high altitudes will ruefully attest) ; but the explanation for boiling is to be found in the elucidation of the relationship between the atmospheric pressure and the vapor pressure of the liquid. Another indictment against the joie-de-vivre hypothesis as an explanation of animal play is that its uncritical adoption tends to discourage and render apparently un- necessary any further attempt to examine in detail the real nature of the reactions thus "explained." Non-utilitarianism. In defining play the majority of writers have agreed that one of the criteria for this form of behavior is that it is not directly useful, although the possibility of eventually practical results is not denied. There are several practical and theoretical objections to this criterion. Very often the conclusion that a particular act per- formed by an animal has no directly practical value is actually no more than a confession of the observer's ignorance. An example will illustrate this point. Vari- ous fishes, including members of the family Belonidae,' exhibit a curious habit of "leaping" over free-floating objects such as sticks and straws. As described by Breder (1932) for Tylosurus raphidomna the reaction of the fish is as follows: First the fish will swim up slowly to the stick so as to be nearly at light angles to it (ill a horizontal plane) aind gently protrude the beak through the surface of the water, sliding the tip over the stick. Usually if the stick is too small and gives way too easily, or too large and gives way too little, the fish will withdraw. If it is of the proper buoyancy and sinks ever so little under the weight of the beak, a violent tail action follows and the fish clears the watel but ill such a manner that usually part of the body rubs against the stick in passing and the fish falls to the other side, from which it may turil and leap back again. Many naturalists who have seen this behavior have colicluded that it is a playful response lacking in any practical outcome (Gudger, 1944). Other observers have noted that fishes which persistently leap over floating sticks are often heavily infested with ectoparasites that are easily scraped off. It has been suggested that leap-</page><page sequence="10">532 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX ing across solid objects may serve to dislodge the para- sites, and thus to free the fish of the infestation (Breder, 1932). The validity of this surmise has yet to be estab- lished by additional observation or by experimental ap- proach; but the significant point would seem to be that it is susceptible to objective verification or disproof. In contrast, it is a very difficult if not impossible task to establish beyond reasonable doubt the absence of utili- tarian function for any type of animal response. Adoption of the non-utilitarianism criterion in its pure form reflects a certain degree of naivete. As has been noted, young animals often perform, incompletely, vari- ous actions which will be executed in their totality during adult life. In the mature animal the behavior in question can be shown to serve an obvious and biologically useful end, such as mating and reproducing, securing food, self- defense, etc. In the young animal the behavior pattern does not terminate in the same result. Accordingly it is sometimes concluded that the reactions of the youngster are without any immediate result or purpose. This is obvious sophistry. There is no reason to as- sume that a given pattern of behavior must serve one and only one end under all conditions and at all stages of development. The flight of a bird may assist it to elude a predacious foe, to secure necessary food, to charm its mate, to transport it to a different environment or to bring about any one of several other equally "practical" results. Furthermore, the scientific study of animal be- havior, if it has taught us nothing else, should have im- pressed upon us the folly of trying to define a prior the motives and ends of animal conduct. It is unadulterated nonsense to assume that, in the absence of intensive and prolonged study, the human observer is capable of dis- cerning the presence or absence of a "useful" result consequent to a complex response. (The eating of bones by pregnant female mammals of non-carnivorous species was thought useless until advanced understanding of the physiology of pregnancy revealed the need for extra sup- plies of calcium.) The practicality or usefulness of a course of action is</page><page sequence="11">No. 785] CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS .533. a function of a multiplicity of variables. A man trans- ported suddenly into a new and strange cultural setting would be at a loss to recognize the motives for certain response patterns, and might be quite incapable of dis- criminating between utilitarian and non-utilitarian modes of conduct. The building up of a comfortable financial reserve in anticipation of future emergencies is a prac- tical and utilitarian bit of behavior in our culture. The same behavior would be highly impractical not to say socially dangerous among Mexicans of the Sinaloa region; for in their culture a man is responsible for the support of all relatives whose resources are inferior to his own. Therefore the individual with wealth or a new house is perpetually parasitized by less fortunate relatives who continue with him as long as the money lasts or the house stands. Thus the accumulation of " excess " worldly goods is practical in one social setting and quite the oppo- site in another. * If, without extensive study, man can not differentiate between " useful " and " useless " behavior in fellow mem- bers of his own species, how can he expect to make such a discrimination in connection with the reactions of ani- mals of an entirely different genus, and even class? RESULTS OF PLAY Although many writers agree that playful acts must be performed because of the pleasure or satisfaction which .they engender, and can not have any immediate, utili- tarian outcome, it is nevertheless often stated that certain types of play do possess important, long-term effects. Youthful practise for adult life. It is common knowl- edge that immature animals frequently perform incom- pletely or imperfectly, and without apparent useful out- comne, certain patterns of behavior which will be exhibited during adulthood in complete and biologically effective form. This observation has so impressed many writers that they interpret one function of the play of young ani- mals as "an irresponsible apprenticeship to the serious. business of life" (Pycraft, 1912; Mitchell, 1912). Adherents of this view usually make several basic as-</page><page sequence="12">I534 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX sumptions. (1) The type of play to which this theory pertains is held to be determined largely by heredity, since it is believed to appear without opportunity for learning or imitation, and takes approximately the same form in all members of a given species. (2) Although instinct accounts for its broad outlines, the response is regarded as being imperfectly organized upon a purely genetic basis, so that each individual must perfect the inherited reactions by practice and repetition. (3) An intriguing ramification of the theory is stated in the further postulate that the types of behavior under con- sideration are all of great biological importance, since each is essential to the life of the individual and thus to the perpetuation of the species. It is pointed out that the play period of infancy permits the practice of these vital responses under conditions where error and incom- pleteness are not fatal. The extension or modification of inherited tendencies is thus possible before the animal is subjected to the exigencies of an independent existence, wherein the forces of natural selection are constantly operating to weed out inefficiency, and the penalty for error may be sudden death (C. L. Morgan, 1900). It is not impossible that experience gained during the practice of certain activities during youth increases the efficiency with which the same responses will be performed in maturity. However, the observation that the acts are performed incompletely or inexpertly by the young ani- mal, and appear in more complete and biologically-effec- -tive formn in the behavior repertoire of the adult, does not justify the conclusion that the perfection of the adult's reaction is a result of the practice during immaturity. If we are to prove, rather than assume, that the kitten's .repeated chase and capture of the ball of string is later reflected in improved mousing, it must be shown that kit- -tens which have had no opportunity to play at chasing and catching are poorer mouse catchers in adult life than are other cats which have had normal opportunities for such practice during kittenhood. The same comparison holds true for all other types of play which have been assumed to "polish and perfect imperfect instincts."</page><page sequence="13">No. 785] CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS 535 Unfortunately, objective proof of this nature is almost completely lacking.1 Perhaps a puppy which is kept in isolation from all other animals, and thus prevented from indulging in sham fights, will, upon the attainment of maturity, be equally as ferocious and successful a fighter as other dogs which participated in countless mock bat- tles during puppyhood. These suggestions run counter to the interpretation of play as a form of essential train- ing and preparation for adult life; but the important point is that we simply do not know which supposition most closely approximates the facts. Only direct test will settle the question. In a few instances there is good reason to believe that the "playful" execution of a behavior pattern during immaturity is without effect so far as the performance of the same response in adulthood is concerned. For example, during their wrestling, chasing and mock-fight- ing immature rats often execute large portions of the adult mating pattern (Small, 1899; Beach, 1942a). If, however, rats are raised in individual cages, so that they have no opportunity for any such practice, they mate during adult life in exactly the same fashion and with the same effectiveness as -do their brothers which have been raised with females (Stone, 1922; Beach, 1942b). This is not to say that the infantile practice of various behavioral reactions is always without effect upon the efficiency with which the responses are executed later in life. The conditions under which a kitten is raised have a powerful effect upon its tendency to kill rats (Rogers, 1932; Kuo, 1938). Some kittens fail to develop rat- killing behavior when raised in isolation but display such reactions after they have observed rat-chasing and killing on the part of another cat (Kuo, 1930). The play period of some primates is prolonged, and involves the execution of many activities later indulged in by the adult (Yerlies and Tomlin, 1935). It is known that sexually inexperienced adult male chimpanzees often 1 As a matter of fact, young kittens which " play " with rats are less likely to become rat killers when they mature than are kittens that fail to exhibit mock chases or capture responses (K1uo, 1930).</page><page sequence="14">536 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX are incapable of mnating effectively with the receptive female. Apparently a great deal of experimentation and practice is necessary before this Vital part of the animal's behavior repertoire can be carried out effi- ciently; and Bingham (1928) has found that immature chimpanzees exhibit sex play very frequently during childhood. ; It is not too much to assume that this practice has its beneficial effects upon adult performance. How- ever, to assume is not to know, and in this case, as in every other, direct test of the hypothesis offers the only means of arriving at a final answer. A point sometimes overlooked by adherents to the the- ory that play serves a preparatory function is the occur- rence of similar responses in adult animals. Cooper (1942) has described the play of mature African lions as consisting chiefly of hiding behind objects and then creep- ing forth to stalk and perhaps leap upon another adult. Presumably the grown animal has no need to practice such activities (although it would undoubtedly be sug- gested by some authors that this behavior is a means of keeping the responses in good working order!); but of course the fact that such playful reactions occur in adult life does not prevent theni from serving a preparatory function in the juvenile animal. Exploration and experimentation. Exploratory play is sometimes held to familiarize the animal with the properties and potentialities of the world about 'it. An eventually practical outcome of such play has been thought to lie in its tendency to promote the development of new modes of conduct and to inhibit biologically dan- gerous reactions. From the psychiatric point of view, Masserman (1944) has suggested that exploratory re- sponses represent one expression of an anticipatory need to determine the relative safety and potentialities of the environment. Although these assumed functions of exploratory play are based upon a prior reasoning more than controlled observation, there are some in- stances in which they can be shown to exist. Kohler (1931) reports that captive chimpanzees given stout sticks or poles soon devised a crude form of vault-</page><page sequence="15">No. 785] CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS 537 ing or jumping, using the stick as a crutch. Originally this response was indulged in apparently as a form of amusement, and was not used as a means of achieving any secondary objective as far as the observer could determine. Although further test and observation would be necessary to establish the point, it seems probable that the pole-vaulting response was a form of play, and the outgrowth of- experimentation with the stick. Later, however, when the apes were confronted with the prob- lem of obtaining a banana which was suspended above their reach they quickly put the vaulting technique to good use, employing it as a means of getting the fruit. Socialization. Some kinds of play have been assumed to encourage particular types of inter-individual reac- tions. It will be recalled that chimpanzees engage in various social activities which involve participation by several individuals. Tinklepaugh (1940) has proposed that such behavior early in life enhances the individual's adaptability and cooperativeness, both of which are es- sential characteristics of the species. Self-expresston or diversion. Yerkes (1943) states that play in chimpanzees is one form of self-expression, self-amusement or diversion. He has observed animals draping themselves and wearing strips of cloth or paper, fruit skins, flowering plants or leafy branches. (Whether or not such reactions can be interpreted as self-adornment is a moot point; but the element of diversion is held to be obvious.) Apes often "paint" or smear objects or flat surfaces with feces, and this too is a form of activity which Yerkes regards as self-expressive, and perhaps playful. Kohler (1931) describes the manner in which chim- panzees moistened white clay with saliva and then pro- ceeded to daub the resulting mixture on their own bodies and upon all sorts of objects in their environment. The proposed socialization and diversion functions of certain kinds of play appear reasonable and logical, but must be regarded as speculative until further evidence is forthcoming.</page><page sequence="16">538 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX POTENTIAL METHODS OF APPRLOACH If it is apparent that current understanding of play in animals is limited, and that presently accepted criteria and explanations are inadequate, it should be equally obvious that there are various steps which could be taken to improve the situation. Controlled observations. The most pressing need is for controlled observation of those activities which are customarily regarded as play. To replace the anecdotal, impressionistic or romanticized descriptions of animal be- havior there must be provided detailed, objective accounts based upon repeated observation. Information is needed, not only concerning the observable reactions of the ani- mal, but also regarding various aspects of the environ- mental situation. So far we know practically nothing as to the probable stimulus patterns which elicit playful responses. A beginning in this direction has been made by a few workers. For example, Cooper (1942) reports that the play of lions occurs most commonly following a major change in the environment, such as release of the animals from an inside cage, the introduction of new individuals into the pride or the sudden appearance of the attendant. It is added that play frequently takes place just before feeding time, is more common on cool days, and is shown by females more than males. Studies of the ontogenetic development and regression of play in a single species would be valuable, and would supplement the vague generalization that play is essen- tially an infantile activity. In so far as possible records gathered under field con- ditions should be checked in a setting permitting sys- tematic variation of the stimulus situation. Definitions and criteria. 'In attempting to define or set up criteria for play it should first of all be recognized that no single hypothesis can be formulated to explain all forms of play in every animal species. The types of activity which are commonly termed playful are so vari-</page><page sequence="17">No. 785] CONCEPTS OF PLAY IN ANIMALS 539 able in form and complexity that a different interpre- tation is indicated at least for each major category. Secondly, it must be apparent that many playful and non-playful pursuits differ in subtle and elusive fashion. There is no sharp borderline between play and work for animals, any more than for man. The two types of activity are often difficult to distinguish, and some com- plex responses may be partly play and partly work (Kollarits, 1940). This means that any serviceable definition of play must be based upon a number of predominating charac- teristics which combine to set if off from non-playful be- havior; and can not be derived from adherence to one or two rigid criteria such as imperfect, juvenile performance or non-utilitarianism. It may eventually prove helpful, if the facts warrant, to state that playful reactions as a class tend to lack the immediate, biologically useful re- sults which normally accompany non-playful responses; but it is definitely inadvisable to set up as an inflexible rule the dictum that no activity is play if it achieves a useful end. Thirdly, the conclusion is inescapable that play must eventually be defined in objective terms. If no such de- finition has yet been forthcoming its absence may be traced directly to the lack of essential data. In connec- tion with other, equally complex types of animal behavior, workers are building interpretations founded on recog- nized, demonstrable physiological and psychological proc- esses and functions. Learning, maternal behavior, court- ship and matiiig, territory defense, social dominance and a host of equally important categories of response have proven susceptible to an objective approach. There is no reason to believe that play is unique in this respect. Experimental validation of theories. We have pre- viously indicated the necessity of subjecting to direct test certain currently accepted interpretations of the func- tions of play. There is no need to limit ourselves to speculation in this field. If they actually exist, the "pre- paratory " function, the "experimental" function and the</page><page sequence="18">540 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXIX "socialization" function which have been assigned to play can be objectively demonstrated, quantitatively measured and operationally defined. Furthermore, as new evidence justifies their formulation, new theories can and should be exposed to the "test-revise-retest" process of critical analysis. Human applications. In closing it may be worth while to comment on the fact that play in humans, although it has been studied more extensively than play in animals, is only partially understood (Alverdes, 1932; Blunmenfeld, 1941; Britt and Janus, 1941; Curti, 1930; Dever, 1917; Watson, 1919). An evolutionary approach has proven fruitful in advancing our knowledge of many phases of human behavior; and it is not too much to hope that the careful study of animal play will offer potentially sig- nificant results in the increased understanding of similar behavior in man. :REFERENCES Alverdes, F. 1932.
