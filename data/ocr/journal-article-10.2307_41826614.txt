<plain_text><page sequence="1">67 FIG. 1 PERUVIAN TEXTILES Weaving is one of the most ancient of the great arts; it appears at the very dawn of man's history and is inseparable from true culture. It has been aptly called "the nurse of civilization." Peruvian textiles have only recently been discov- ered and because of their great artistic beauty, which is more perfect even than that of their pottery vessels, have im- mediately attracted general attention. The diversity of material and technique vies with the splendor of the colors, and the strange conventionalized animal figures give an added delight to the eye and the mind. Of the four great textile fibers, silk, wool, cotton, linen, the Peruvians used three, a fact that proves a high standard of civilization, and also a far greater inde- pendence from outside influences than we are inclined to credit them with. For if they had depended upon foreign culture, they might have imported raw silk or silk worms from China. As it is known, there was communication among the Pacific island groups in prehistoric times, and Chinese traders might have ventured to the Peruvian coast. The fibers used by the Peruvians were cotton, both white and reddish brown; wool from the alpaca, vicuna and llama; hemp, derived from Agave americana or maguey; and very long and rather coarse human hair for narrow black outlines. Their hemp or bast fiber is inferior to the true flax of ancient Egypt and mostly used for twines and in making nets and bags, of which our collection has no specimen. Both cotton and wool were used with great craft. Almost all their yarns are two or more ply, thus insuring a greater evenness and strength. Both the cottons are wiry and inferior to the exceedingly fine cotton threads of ancient India; the white variety is better, but the brown seems to have been preferred, perhaps for soms superstitious reason. It is in- teresting to find it referred to in old litera- ture as having been reserved for the rulers - a parallel of the royal purple and scarlet of Asia and Europe. All their wool comes from animals be- longing to the camel family; that of the vicuna is the finest, the llama's the coarsest. The spinning is better than the best machine spinning of today, and the Peru- vians, like the weavers of the Dacca muslins and Cashmere shawls of old India, seem to have applied certain principles that are unknown to us. Y et their means were of the simplest: spindles consisting of a single stick of palm wood, pointed at both ends and ornamented with a pottery band in the center which both strength- ened and helped to balance the spindle. Sometimes, when a longer spindle was</page><page sequence="2">68 desired, two pitees of pointed palm wood were stuck in the ends of a piece of hollow cane. Fig. 1 (right) shows a conven- tionalized picture of a lady with very elaborate headdress, spinning; the spindle rests in a bowl which also contains the water to moisten the fiber. For the sake of symmetry the spindle and the rocket which she holds over the shoulder are re- peated. Some Peruvian textiles show traces of tinsel yarn, obtained by twisting a thin band of silver about a finished yarn, the softer silver covering the entire surface. We have no specimen of this practice. Balls of yarn about the size of an orange, tightly wound about some hard object like a corncob, have been found and are supposed to have served as a form of currency. The textile development of pre-Inca P;tu is un: que, a perfect record of the technical and artistic development of a single people. The mechanical and even the artistic resemblance to some Asiatic- fabrics can perhaps be sufficiently ex- plained by the fact that in Asia and Peru cotton became the principal fiber. Similar material leads to similar technique. Cotton is almost always used as a warp in woolen weaves. The ancient Peruvians had attained a very high perfection in the development of diverse weaving tech- niques; that of tapestry and embroidery being carried to supreme height. Brocade and bobbin-weave are closely allied to embroidery, but of a later and higher development. Gauze and double cloth are technically even more advanced. A curious and sometimes misleading charac- teristic of Peruvian webs is the passing in the same fabric from one technique to another. Plain weave, tapestry, and em- broidery often appear in the same frag- ment, and it is yet another proof of their skill at the loom. Quite commonly we find tapestry borders which appear to be sewed on to a plain fabric, but upon inspection we find the warp running through. By far the finest and most numerous fragments discovered are the tapestries. FIG. 2 The kelim technique of a loom with a mechanical contrivance for lifting the warp threads, may go back to Llapchi- lulli, the companion of Naimlap, a legen- dary "maker of clothes and feather gar- ments." No Persian kelims were ever woven finer than some Peruvian tapestries, and they will bear a comparison with Coptic and Alexandrian workmanship and with the silk tapestry of China. The slits where the different colors meet are either left open, as in the true kelim technique, or are joined by web locking, warp locking or eccentric weft, all three practices much more elaborate than the simple sewing up of the slits on the wrong side, which is commonly done in European tapestry. Our collection shows examples of almost all degrees of fineness; as a rule we can assign the coarser samples to a later period, even to the last, that of the Inca. Brocading is the addition of an extra</page><page sequence="3">69 ornamental weft, inserted during the actual weaving of the fabric. Many specimens of true brocading are so exquisite that they were at first supposed to be embroidered. Fig. 2 shows a gauze-like ground with brocaded mythological figures or priests in jaguar robes officiating at an altar. Although gauze has always been supposed to be a peculiar Asiatic technique, the old weavers of Pachacamac used it with absolute freedom and brought it to a remarkable degree of complexity. They even formed designs in the ground, or embroidered the fabric with that very ancient form of needlework which we find still practised among Italian peasants, the buratto. FIG. 3 Bobbin-weaving resembles modern Jac- quard figuring because the weft crosses through irregular sheds and over arbitrary groups of warp, to produce the design. Contrary to tapestry weaving, each color of the weft makes the complete traverse of the entire warp. There are two dis- tinct types of bobbin- weaving: in the simpler method the weft produces the design on the surface only, the reverse being a jumble of loose threads; the other method makes a practically double-faced cloth, of which both sides are equally finished, the design appearing in reversed colors. Fig. 3 shows a very important fragment in which we find both types represented. The reverse side of the material is shown at the lower end of the illustration: we see the wider stripe having the loose hanging threads, the narrower the double-faced design. Double cloth, or two-beam weaving with two sets of warps and two sets of wefts which are combined into a single fabric on the loom, is often found in Peru. The weaving is done on both sides of the loom and at intervals the separate fabrics are locked into a single web by the cross- ing of the two sets of yarn. It is just short of miraculous how the Peruvian weaver with her simple contrivances could produce these elaborately calcu- lated and technically finished fabrics. The Peruvians were expert dyers, the colors being in most cases absolutely fresh. Printed fabrics have been found, also fragments of tied dyes. It is difficult, almost impossible, to assert the exact place of production of most of these pre-conquest fabrics. At the time of the conquest (1532) Peru comprised not only the present-day area, but also the greater part of Ecuador and Bolivia, and extended southwards far into Chile, so that its entire area was about half the size of the United States. There is a strong family resemblance between the textiles from the different centers of population of old Peru. The oldest cities, high up in the Andes, Cuzco and the great Tiahuanaco on Lake Titicaca, were not quite as advanced in textile skill as were the ancient centers of civilization adjacent to the modern city of Lima. Most of the finest pieces are found in the ruins of Ancon and Pachacamac. These coast places reflected the influence of Tiahua- naco. In the Inca period the wonderful simplicity of geometric and highly con- ventionalized art, typical of the best work of the ancients, is replaced by grotesque realism and a general lack of design balance. The Spanish conquest upset even these last attempts at a national craft, and although the Peruvian Indian in the Andes region is still weaving good practical fabrics and heavy blankets, the art of the textile craftsman came to an end</page><page sequence="4">70 FIG. 4 even before the Inca conquest, in the thir- teenth and fourteenth centuries. Peruvian textiles, above and beyond their technical qualities, have a great artistic appeal. To our sophisticated modern taste the simple geometrical patterns are perhaps most congenial, but the strange-looking conventionalized animals and human beings give it its dis- tinctive character. The subjects treated can be summed up under three heads: 1) Geometric figures: scrolls, frets, meanders, lozenges and others, most of which show their evolution from primitive basket work, and are common property to many peoples and races. 2) Symbolism: figures which probably have a religious and to temistic significance. 3) Conventionalism: animals and parts of animals, in which the degeneration has not been carried to such an extreme as to make the identification impossible. A fourth division, realism, the would-be realistic representation of objects and scenes, belongs to the degenerate period after the thirteenth century. The geometrical designs serve as con- necting links to the conventionalized animal figures, often they are part of them. They are also used separately or to balance a design. The symbolic designs occur on the great 1 Walter Lehmann, The Art of Old Peru. carved walls at Tiahuanaco (Fig. 6i) which are, like the glazed tiles of Assyrian art, a reproduction in stone of woven materials, - the petrefaction of wall hang- ings. We know about the Babylonian tapestries which were probably kelims with figurai designs and were highly esteemed by Roman collectors of the time of Pliny. We also know that in the European middle ages the walls of living rooms were covered with paintings al fresco , or with tapestries, these latter having the advantage of giving an appearance of warmth and they could be rolled up for transportation. It is quite possible that the early rulers of Peru had their summer palaces high up in the mountains, at Cuzco or near beautiful Lake Titicaca, and that they moved down to the coast when the cold weather set in. In this case they would have wanted to be surrounded by their most highly valued properties at all times. The Peruvian of old had no domesti- cated animals, except the llama, and it was used only as a beast of burden. While there have been found numbers of repre- sentations of llamas both in pottery and silver - votive offerings most probably - they do not occur on the textiles. The chief animals represented here are fish, birds and cats.</page><page sequence="5">71 The fish motive occurs far more fre- quently than any other, quite naturally so, for fish was the staple food for a large part of the inhabitants of Peru. For mechanical reasons the pattern very often consists of two fish, turned in opposite directions, thus making an "interlocked" design. The head is triangular, seen from the side, with one eye; the rest of the body suggests the out- line of a fish as seen from above. The bird has suffered far less in the course of being conventionalized ; it is generally quite clearly featured (Fig. 4, left); sometimes however only parts of a bird protrude from a zigzag line, or two interlocked heads have the beak in com- mon. The three great cats occuring in Peru- vian fauna are found represented in textiles, the puma, the jaguar and the titi or wild mountain cat. On Fig. 6 the belt of the god consists of two pumas with interlocked bodies and protruding heads. Two typical borders, one with fringe attached, show rows of cats walking with arched backs and high tails, turning their heads in full view to the beholder. The puma seems to have been kept in cap- tivity, probably for purposes of the hunt, for we often find representations of it with a ring through the nose. Man and mythological beings are found wherever the influence of the great cultural center, Tiahuanaco, reached. Our collec- tion includes several specimens of great interest, technically and from the point of view of the anthropologist. Fig. 5 shows the finest of all, a fragment of ex- ceedingly fine kelim fabric, of which the groundwefts have almost completely dis- appeared, making the well preserved design stand out as from a background of lace. Four anthropomorphic deities with arge headdresses are flanked on either side by a figure of a priest offering sacrifice and, still smaller in scale, by worshippers. Fig. 4, right, shows the fish-god, a basket with fish on the head, a fish in either hand, and surrounded by fish. Fig. 1 (center) gives another representation of the same FIG. 5 deity - he is a lunar god, while the cat god from the wall carving of Tiahuanaco (Fig. 6) is a solar god. Valuable textiles have at all times and in all places been favorites for votive gifts. Partly as such, but mostly owing to the loving care of the dead, we owe our knowl- edge of their great art and craftsmanship. We have good cause to be grateful to their firm belief in a life after death which caused them to fill the tombs of their be- loved with all they might have held dear in life, in order to make them feel com- fortable in the strange new surroundings.
