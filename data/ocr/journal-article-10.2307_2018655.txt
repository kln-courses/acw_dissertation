<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XXXIV, No. 21 OCTOBER 14, 1937 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY THE NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ESTHETICS AND OF THE SCIENCE OF ART THE Ninth International Congress of Philosophy, the Congres Descartes as it was called in commemoration of the three hun- dredth anniversary of the publication of the Discourse on Method, opened in Paris in a setting which was inspiring. That elegance which we have come to think of as peculiarly French was present not only in the decorations of the Sorbonne's great amphitheater, but also in the speeches which welcomed us to Paris. The presence of M. Lebrun, heralded by a magnificent rendering of the Marseillaise, and of M. Zay, Minister of Education, gave the occasion an official spon- sorship which might have displeased Diogenes but which certainly gratified those who were able to be present. The program was lightened by the band of the Garde R6publicaine, which, as if aware that its r8le was to represent the senses rather than the reason, played selections which Gounod-if not Bach-would have applauded, selec- tions cleverly harmonized, yet largely melody and efficient rhythm. Even M. Paul Valery sat beating time with his gloves and few of us could have escaped the feeling that this was to be a philosophical congress without tears. Accepting philosophy as the joyful science, the French were determined to give it the proper mise-en-scene. The main attraction of the afternoon was M. Valery. After an opening in the conventional manner, excusing his presence and sacri- ficing his cock to Aesculapius, he began his speech proper in a style whose sinuosities and delicate shadings resembled a flute solo. No one could have beaten time to it, least of all your reporter. The time, however, was not its most important characteristic-wherein it did not resemble the music of the Garde R6publicaine. Its sub- stance was more arresting. For M. Valery declared in public before eight hundred philosophers that one read Descartes not for his method nor for his ideas, but for his self-revelation. It is, he an- nounced, Descartes "magnificent and memorable Ego" which makes it worth our while to read him today, that Ego which was willing to make a tabula rasa of the accumulated knowledge of his time and to reconstruct the world out of his own self-consciousness. (So M. Lalo was to point out later in a wittier manner that what one read any philosopher for was not the truth but the beauty of his system.) 561</page><page sequence="2">562 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY That Descartes had a magnificent and memorable Ego no one would be foolish enough to deny. But that one reads philosophers as one would read diarists, let us say, must have struck many in the audience as somewhat novel. And yet when one remembers the diverse and contradictory interpretations of this uniquely clear writer, to which M. Valery also invited our attention, one is perhaps forced to conclude that if Descartes does not give us a fine example of self-expression, he gives us at least a fine opportunity for it. That conclusion is borne out when one reads over the twelve volumes which contain the proceedings of the Congress. Thus Mr. Benes of Prague assures us of the fundamental im- portance of the Meditations as an expression of that philosophical intuition which can alone systematize our thoughts into an effective synthesis; Miss Sarah Brown gives us the fundamental postulates of Cartesianism, none of which is the synthesizing activity of philo- sophical intuition; while Mr. Jacques Chevalier announces that "it is beyond doubt that the unity of intelligence as of knowing constitutes the fundamental principle as well as the ultimate end of Descartes' philosophy." Mr. Jean Delvolve, on the other hand, sees in Des- cartes' dualism a second source of philosophy, but the dualism is not that of two substances, but that of two modes of knowledge, the first an intuition-as in the cogito-in which both subject and object are one, the second a knowledge of ideas, in which a reality external to thought is affirmed; Mr. Maritain, however, maintains that for Des- cartes the object of knowledge is always in the realm of essence. There is, of course, some justification for all of these theories, but can they all be equally true? The members of the Congress seemed to be similarly divided when it was a matter of detail. Descartes' cogito ergo sum is, of course, one of the centers about which his thinking can be organized. Just what the cogito means is therefore a matter of some importance. For Mr. Gueroult it is "the apprehension of a necessary, singular truth, of the same nature as a mathematical truth." For Mr. Gou- hier it requires the backing of an optimistic faith in a God, the creator of eternal truths. For Mr. Gouvian it requires no logical interpretation, since doubt is in its very nature the assertion of exist- ence. For Mr. Carbonara the very opposite is true, and he points out that when Descartes wishes to construct a world, he has to put aside his cogito. One could continue this catalogue throughout all the papers presented. There was thus no great unity either of method or of belief in the communications. Some of the papers read like bad lyric poems whose authors were more interested in what Mr. Lalo calls "poly- phony" than in truth. Others are constructed with a great show of</page><page sequence="3">INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY 563 logistic apparatus and analysis so finely divided that it is next to impossible to perceive the subject of discussion. Some are on sub- jects whose importance would appear to be purely academic, others dealt with problems, such as that of causality and determinism, which almost everyone would admit to be fundamental. In the bewildering mass of papers there stand out a few of ex- ceptional brilliance. Among them are those which occupied one of the plenary sessions devoted to the question of determinism. The session opened with two papers by Louis and Maurice de Broglie. That of the former suggested that while no prediction is possible re- garding individual phenomena in quantum mechanics, yet one might still speak of causality. "Let us consider," he said (in the printed version of his paper which alone is at hand), "a phenomenon A, which is always succeeded by some one of the phenomena Bi, B2, B3. . . . If, furthermore, none of the phenomena Bi, B2, B3 ... is produced when A is not produced, one may say, adopting a broad definition of causality, that A is the cause of the phenomena Bi, B2, B3. . . . Herein, he continued, we have causality but not deter- minism, since "we can in no way predict which of the phenomena B1, B2, B3 . . . will be produced when A is produced." Thus in quantum mechanics we can say that a screen bombarded by electrons will flash at certain points, but we can not tell what points will flash. Thus we are said to have causality-the bombardment by the elec- trons causes the flashes-but not determinism. This is of course cold comfort to the causalists, for they want to know precisely what "causes" the flashes to appear here rather than there. But on this level Mr. de Broglie was personally convinced, he said, that no rigor- ous determinism was likely to be found. The paper of Maurice de Broglie, though less concrete than his brother's, was perhaps for that very reason more suggestive. It discussed the role of experience in the progress of modern science and tried to explain the physicists' enforced departure from the mechanical models which provided the basic metaphors for classical physics. The result has been the theories which have seemed scan- dalous to both common sense and traditional philosophy. The scan- dal has been due, of course, to the use by both common sense and phi- losophy of uncriticized metaphors. We must, as Mr. de Broglie points out, form some image of how things work and the customary images come from common-sense mechanics. (There was a time, as Mr. de Broglie did not point out, when they came from human psy- chology.) But that is only one part of science. The other part is somewhat different. It "condenses in a mathematical expression, which must be admitted as given, a whole chain of inductions which transform, so to speak, the aspect of the accumulated facts by giving</page><page sequence="4">564 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY us a harmoniously constructed system [edifice] where there appeared to be only raw materials or temporary structures isolated from each other and unrelated." A philosopher would immediately prick up his ears at the words, "a mathematical expression which must be ad- mitted as given," and Mr. de Broglie was not unaware of the diffi- culty thus presented. "These initial formulas," he said, "are but posited and have no explanatory value as far as the principles in- cluded in them are concerned. They merely translate them and justify them by their consequences. To go to extremes one could say that when one does not understand something, one makes it a basis of explanation. This boutade should not hinder us from per- ceiving the very great service which the new theories have rendered to physical science, of which they have shown us an absolutely novel side. Yet they must remind us that the finest syntheses are at bot- tom only a new form of our ignorance." The recognition of this by an authoritative scientist must not be underemphasized by philosophers. It suggests once more that theories are answers to questions and that the nature of a question- which is a psychological and not a logical problem-is fundamental for an understanding of the nature of science. That element which Meyerson called "the irrational" might very well be called "the facts" and the choice of facts is not determined until some theory is already under construction. One of the best examples of Mr. de Broglie's thesis is the use made by relativists of the perihelion of Mercury. It was a problem for Newtonians; it became an explana- tion for Einsteinians. Such shifts are not uncommon in the history of ideas, but the strictly logical treatment of science, dealing, as it must, only with complete theories, can not account for them. The stimulating papers of the brothers de Broglie were admirably complemented by Mr. Barzin's exposition of what he believes to be the relations between probability and determinism. This paper was one of those rarely beautiful exercises in exposition which seem to be the monopoly of the French. So beautiful was his speech-de- livered, it should be added, as if it were an improvisation-that the audience burst into prolonged applause. Mr. Barzin's thesis was the possibility of transforming every statistical law into a causal law. To quote the author's summary, the difference between causal and statistical law "reduces to a ques- tion of method. The present state of logical research into the nature of probability (in the opposing theories of Keynes and Reichenbach) shows that one must base this calculus upon a principle of induction. But induction is possible only by the assertion of a universal de- terminism. The constancy of statistical laws alone makes the use of the calculus of probabilities possible." The question therefore be-</page><page sequence="5">INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY 565 comes that of the ground of statistical constancy. This can not be experience, because experience is by general agreement limited. It must consequently be woven into the texture of the universe and a revelation of cosmic determinism. Mr. Barzin next proceeded to show that both causal and statistical laws are "simply two stages of a single inquiry carried out to a greater or less degree." He did this by utilizing one of the papers of C. S. Peirce which demonstrates the possibility of finding in any group of objects some property which is common to them and pos- sessed by no object outside the group. By means of Peirce's proof, says Mr. Barzin, we can assert of any statistical law-"the event Q follows the condition or set of conditions P in m cases out of n. The m events of P, which are all followed by the event Q, have then . . . a distinctive quality which differentiates them from the events of P not followed by event Q. If we find this quality, our statistical law is immediately transformed into a causal law of the following form: All the events of P possessing the quality in question deter- mine the event Q." Mr. Barzin admits that the quality in question may be practically impossible to find; yet its theoretical existence is certain and sufficient to persuade us that all statistical laws can be transformed into causal laws. The cleverness of this demonstration will not be denied and yet one may question its relevancy to the problem under discussion. If one means by "causality" what Meyerson meant, then it would not be sufficient to point out the theoretical possibility of the antecedents' possessing a single differentia. One would also have to demonstrate that the consequents possess one and that the two differentiwe could theoretically be identified. But though Peirce's proof showed the possibility of the consequents' having a single differentia, it did not by any means show-and of course had no interest in showing-the identity between the two. Mr. Barzin might reply that his concep- tion of causality is not that of Meyerson. But the only clue which he gives us as to the nature of causality is the use of the word "de- termine. " His example of a statistical law is, Q follows P in m cases out of n. These m cases have a distinctive quality, let us say d. We then phrase our causal law, Q is "determined" by the quality d. But what does "determined" mean in this context other than, Q follows the occurrence of the sub-class Pd ? We know more about the occurrence of Q than we did before we discovered d and we have greater powers of prediction-that is, more evidence on which to calculate our fraction of probability. But unless we had already discovered some differentia in the events labelled P, we should never have formulated our original statistical law, Q follows P in rn cases out of n.</page><page sequence="6">566 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY As if to complete the program so happily begun, Mr. Barzin's paper was followed by Mr. Montague's. Mr. Barzin had shown the possibility of reconciling legalism and causalism; Mr. Montague tried to realize that possibility. His program consisted in accepting the extra-experiential categories of reason (substance, potentiality, and cause) and showing their basis in experience. This basis is the inner life, Descartes' res cogitans, Bergson's duree reelle. (It is, if a reporter may become a school-master, also Maine de Biran's conative soul.) Since we carry substance, potentiality, and cause about within us, and know them immediately for what they are, we have a right to utilize categories derived from them. Such a pro- gram would seem to convict America's "avowed materialist" either of naive subjectivism or uncritical anthropomorphism. But Mr. Montague saw these dangers and denied any duality between mind and matter. His particular metaphysics is too well known to readers of this JOURNAL to require any exposition here. One question per- sists, however, when any ontological monism is propounded. Why, if everything is fundamentally alike, does it look so different? Until some satisfactory account is given of the materializing of mind or the mentalizing of matter, the Scotch verdict will continue to be pronounced. Mr. Montague, who has a fine eye for difficulties in his own thinking, has met this question fairly; unfortunately he did not have the time to anticipate it in his address before the Congress and answer it. Almost as interesting, if not so dramatic, as this program was the morning devoted to methodology. Mr. Reichenbach opened the ses- sion with a paper called La philosophie scientifique. Scientific phi- losophy, according to Mr. Reichenbach, is based upon the probable assertions of empirical science, rather than upon the necessary and certain assertions of mathematics. In that it differs from the ra- tionalism of the seventeenth century, which also was a scientific phi- losophy, as well as from the non-scientific philosophies. Mathe- matics, according to the well-known formula of the Viennese School, is a system of tautologies "signifying no restriction on the physical world." Thus its certainty is bought at the price of renouncing all content. Since scientific philosophy wishes to have content, it sacri- fices certainty and fundamentally its assertions are bets. These bets are more or less good, depending of course upon their probability and can only be justified by their success in prediction. This pragmatic attitude was expressed by Mr. Reichenbach as follows. In the old days the absence of certainty would have led to scepticism. But the new scientific philosophy "is ready to sacrifice the ideal of absolute certainty without sacrificing the attainment of knowledge in so far as it is attainable. We accept the world in the form in which it is given;</page><page sequence="7">INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY 567 we are satisfied to act in it as well as we can. We wish to act, to do something in this world; and if we can not arrange our acts so that they will produce with certainty the desired effects, we are satisfied to do as well as possible. That is the only answer worthy of the scientist faced with the choice of certain but empty assertions and the uncertainty of knowledge." This paper, which added but little to the ideas already published by Mr. Reichenbach and his colleagues, left one question unanswered -a question, it should be added, which was not raised. Whence do we derive our concepts of those logical relations which make in- ference in mathematics possible? The obvious, but unedifying, answer is, from our teachers and textbooks. If philosophers were willing to admit that even our most rarefied ideas have a history, they might have fewer paradoxes to solve. For then they would cease to look upon the human mind as operating in a vacuum and give to experience its proper place. The imagination has, of course, constructed ideas which seem to have no models in experience. Alice in Wonderland, for instance, is as full of them as Euclid. But the technique of forming such ideas out of the materials of ex- perience is no mystery. Any textbook in psychology-to say nothing of certain parts of Locke's Essay-will throw light upon it. Mr. Enriques attempted an answer to the question of the relation between "reason" and experience. Admitting the existence of a harmony between the two-an admission which one might imagine was forced upon us by experience itself-he then asserted both the non-existence of pure, i.e., non-rational, experience, as well as of pure, i.e., non-empirical, reasoning. This was not proved by him -nor could it be-but his assertion was made very persuasively. He then suggested two attempted solutions of the problem which he believed to be unsatisfactory, (1) that of "English empiricism," (2) that of Kant, and substituted for them a "new epistemology" which "will find its foundation and its peculiar method in the critical history of scientific concepts." This would appear to your reporter to be the epistemology of Meyerson. The relation between reason and nature was further studied by the concluding speaker of the session, Mr. H. J. Pos, in his paper on the origin of method. Discarding the "naturalistic" and "evolu- tionistic" theories of its origin, Mr. Pos turned towards what he called "a source which is anterior to all explicit science, but which, while being anterior to scientific activity, is nevertheless not bio- logical in its nature." The source of method is "spiritual" and not 'vital." The reason why it is not "vital" would appear to be that if it were we could have no disinterested thinking; we should have only problem-solving reactions to puzzling situations. But intelli-</page><page sequence="8">568 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY gence "creates both the problem and its solution." (How then, one might ask, can one distinguish between a real and an imaginary problem?) It is consequently no surprise to hear Mr. Pos announce that method "awakens our most fundamental activity, that of pure thought, that which is thought." Since purity, be it admitted, has never in its unqualified form seduced your reporter, he waited somewhat impatiently for something else. But nothing else was forthcoming. Mr. Pos 's paper con- cluded with a hymn to immaculate conceptions, chanting the free- dom, the purposelessness, the beauty of method. " There is, " it said, "another aspect which reveals the spiritual character of method: its relation to beauty, which, unpremeditated, quite naturally accom- panies it. It is true that the search for truth in one thinker is more oriented towards rigorousness, in another towards elegance; the ex- ample of Plato is there to show that in the highest creations of the spirit all forces support one another. In method man actualizes his spiritual being. He pursues no external end; he satisfies no need. There are grounds for maintaining towards and against modern ir- rationalism the spiritual and eminently human character of method. Irrationalism, which is the philosophy of despair, commits two er- rors: it reduces man to the level of the animals; then it misunder- stands the moral and esthetic character of method. Thus it identi- fies method with calculation and technique. That is the confusion of method with its degradation. The teaching of Descartes, in an age when this confusion dominates, seems doubly precious." In other words, method is utterly uncontrolled, and might just as well be day-dreaming or free association. It is puzzling why so pathological an activity should seem so praise-worthy, except that it provides an excuse for the futility of much of our thinking. But investing any human activity with the proper verbal raiment is suf- ficient to dazzle the critical eye. Call a thing "free" and no one asks, Free from what and for what? One murmurs, "Wie schoen! " as the woman beside your reporter did, and the ecstasy becomes evidential. Not a single example of the spirituality of method and of its freedom was offered by Mr. Pos and none was demanded. To have demanded any would have been to doubt the word of a gentle- man. After a paper of this type it was with a certain discouragement that one continued to obey the categorical imperative. Was there not more philosophy to be picked up talking to one's colleagues at some cafe terrasse than in the deoxygenated atmosphere of the Am- phitheatre Richelieu? There undoubtedly was, but some masochistic strain-that which perhaps made one a professor in the first place- forced one to return to the scene of the crime, even though one</page><page sequence="9">INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY 569 caught oneself from time to time wondering why the Muse of Poetry in the mural painting over the platform wore her hair as one's mother did or what feeling of elegance made the decorator print Athens in Greek characters and Paris in Roman or why people moved in and out of the hall like Congressmen who were not voting. The third plenary session, alas, dealt with the foundations of logic. Mr. Bernays confirmed our suspicions that there was a dif- ference between logic and mathematics. The former is, he said, concerned with the implicit relation of terms and principles and certain characters of reality, the latter with certain relations which are independent of their formulation, i.e., one would gather, not en- tirely syntactical. The question presented itself somewhat dif- ferently to Mr. Fraenkel. He preferred to discuss the logical foundation of some portion of mathematics and chose for his problem "discontinuity and continuity." The historical precedent was Des- cartes' use of analytical geometry, which appeared to Mr. Fraen- kel to be the correlation of points in a continuum with discrete numbers. This was in a sense a "bridging of the gap " between con- tinuous and discontinuous and, as philosophers believe that all gaps should and can be bridged, Mr. Praenkel raised the question whether Descartes' attempt should not be generalized. Are we to have two entirely different logics and mathematics, one for the continuous and one for the discrete, or is there some logical principle, hitherto undis- covered, which will lead from one domain to the other ? The speaker suggested that one might be forthcoming from epistemology, but he did not unfortunately develop his suggestion. It was left for Mr. Orestano to go further than either of his predecessors and suggest a logic which would be really universal. After pointing out the limitations of Aristotelian logic, which he called a logic of classification based upon the metaphysics of sub- stance, he sketched briefly two "postulates" which would permit non-substantive logics. These postulates, though printed in the acts of the Congress, are worth reprinting here. They are: (1) A pure, formal, universal logic must contain uniquely and entirely the rules of the harmony (I'accord) of thought with itself. This postulate exists to establish coherence. (2) Since thought wishes to establish also the harmony between itself and experience, such a logic must contain all "the categories of the understanding." Though all of these categories are ulti- mately harmonious-Mr. Orestano himself speaks of their "func- tional solidarity"'-yet each has its own logic. These are mathe- matical logic, the logic of classifications, i.e., the subject-attribute logic, functional logic (logica dei comportamenti) "comprising all the dynamic relations between experiences." It was too bad that</page><page sequence="10">570 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Mr. Orestano had not enough time at his disposal to discuss his ideas at greater length. Though professional logicians might not have been interested in them, philosophers would have been curious to see him do a bit of reasoning in one of his non-substantive logics. We all know, of course, the strange bias which our linguistic habits have given to our thinking, but outside of mathematics and logistic, no new linguistic habits have ever been initiated. This session was thus largely a voicing of velleities and regrets. But in that it was not much different from most of the other sessions. Philosophers seem to be very gifted in pointing the way, but they too often feel that their task is over at that point. One wishes that they would occasionally tread the road they have indicated, that they would encounter some of the difficulties which a traveller over it would inevitably meet. They have, it would appear, an almost uni- versal custom of dogmatizing and practically no sense of self-criti- cism. Over and over again one would hear opinions announced as obvious truths which struck one as at least questionable and some- times as downright false. Consider the following declaration of Mr. Feldkeller which no translation could do justice to: "Fur die Grie- chen waren Logik und Mathematik noch keine Spinnweben aus Re- lationen und Geltungszusammenhangen, aus Gesetzlichkeiten und 'Werten,' die in der leeren Luft hangen, sondern waren der Welt- grund, geh6rten zum Wesen des Kosmos selber. Die Logik war Philosophie, also keine 'Wissenschaft' im heutigen Sinne. Denn Philosophie tragt nun einmal ein Festtagskleid. Sie ist keine Pro- letarierin. Sie arbeitet nie fur Lohn und Nutzen. Sie ist eine Konigin und hat als solche Weltgeschichte gemacht. " One can only glow at the rhetorical heat of such a passage, but the sun provided sufficient calories last August. Mr. Piobetta, again, read a paper on the dispute between Chanet and Marin Cureau de la Chambre on animal epistemology which he called a polehmique ignoree; a suffi- ciently full account of it in its historical setting was published in America three or four years ago. Mr. Perticone discussing juridical norms declared, "Nous n'agissons jamais en conformite avec la loi exterieure: au lieu de conformite avec la loi exterieure, il faut parler d'unification de 1'acte et de la loi du sujet, qui est a la fois norme de vie sociale, loi objective que le sujet a faite sienne. " Could one not reasonably demand three specific examples of how the individual does this? Your reporter in conversation with his European col- leagues spoke of his uneasiness before such dogmatism, of his hunger for illustrations, if not for proof. He found that such uneasiness was not a sign of intellectual maturity, but rather a symptom of that "American practicality" which is so amusing to Europeans. He had but few occasions to push his conversations very far-his inter-</page><page sequence="11">INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY 571 locutors losing interest when evidence was discussed-but at one moment when he gave way to sincerity and forgot the protocole, he was told, "Then if we did what you ask, what would be the difference between philosophy and science?" That philosophy differs from science as Dichtung from Wahrheit is not a new point of view and it is one which has a certain justifica- tion, if philosophy should be what it has so frequently been in the past. Yet I doubt whether in this country we are satisfied to write sentences which are unverified and unverifiable. One need not be- come a logical positivist to demand some rules which will prevent our talking pure nonsense and pure fiction. We might at least say to ourselves that for pedagogical reasons we shall demand some facts upon which to base our opinions. If we did, we should avoid the idols of Bacon which still seem to blind the eyes of philosophers. The worst of them still seem to be the Idols of the Forum which ap- pear in endless discussions of the "true meaning" of certain terms, the true meaning usually being little more than what the speaker believes rightly or wrongly to be the original etymological meaning of the roots composing the term. The study of philosophical seman- tics is, to be sure, one of the most enlightening branches of philoso- phy, but it certainly does not show us the true meanings of terms. To argue that because, for instance, "logic" meant to someone called "the Greeks" a certain discipline, it should mean the same thing to us, in spite of the fact that it doesn't, seems to your reporter little more than superstition. One might just as well argue that because "anima" originally meant "breath"-if it did, we really mean "breath" today when we speak about the soul. There was also noticeable in the Congresses an extraordinary lov6 of expressing one's opinion. It was in vain that presiding officers pleaded for brevity, pointing out the injustice to speakers on the latter part of the program whose time was being cut short; there were always clamorous objectors who felt that to utter their remarks about the paper which had just been read was much more important than to listen to scheduled papers which had not been read as yet. The result was that in every session of four papers, the latter two were either read in resume or read to an empty hall or both. A nation less gracious than the French would have been less polite to unscheduled speakers and, frankly, more polite to scheduled. When one has travelled at a certain expense to read a paper which a pro- gram committee has seen fit to approve, one expects to have the time to read it. Moreover, after listening to programs for ten days from nine to noon and from two to six, the undersigned has no hesitation in saying that the scheduled papers were by far more interesting than the comments made upon them. For the comments, which in the</page><page sequence="12">572 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY nature of things were chosen by the insistence of the commentators, were often rambling, badly reasoned, and beside the point. A word, a phrase, a triviality, would stimulate a hot reaction, and there was no downing the reactor. As a consequence the discussion resembled that of our American class-rooms, where the most vociferous, rather than the most intelligent, members of the audience are heard. On the positive side, the very richness of the program and the undisciplined discussion gave one a valuable cross-section of present- day philosophy. Many eminent philosophers were absent, or at any rate not speaking. Most of these were of the older generation or in one or two cases not in the favor of the governments ruling in their native countries. But their very absence made the proceedings more nearly representative of what the philosophical world is up to. An historian of our period would find the twelve volumes of papers indispensable therefor. In the second place, a sensitive person attending the Congress could not have resisted the impression that our hosts had admirably succeeded in recreating the cultural atmosphere of the seventeenth century. This would not have been possible outside of France. Other nations could have no doubt given us concerts of seventeenth- century music, shown us portraits of Descartes and his circle and contemporary paintings of the scenes in which he moved, even enter- tained us with ballets and driven us to sites of relevant interest. But what other nation would have thought all this necessary? What other nation would have thought of Descartes as a man living in a definite time and not an item in the frozen panorama of eternity? It was that spirit which animated also the esthetics congress. Its organizers invited not merely philosophers, psychologists, and- his- torians of art, but also artists. In fact it opened with papers by two of France's outstanding poets, Mr. Valery and Mr. Claudel. It utilized the services of painters, musicians, architects, city-planners, poets. Had one not been reporting it, one could have conversed with many of the initiators of contemporary artistic movements. The remarks of these individuals were much more to the taste of your reporter than those of his colleagues in philosophy. Their termi- nology may not have been chosen from the classical lexicon, but their ideas were on the whole more concrete. They seldom talked of "fundamental principles," of "the esthetic object," "form"; they discussed their crafts and let you discover the abstract principles involved. They gave you, in other words, the materials for your esthetic speculation and let you do your own thinking. There is still, it would appear, a certain amount of what Profes- sor Lovejoy has called "metaphysical pathos" in the writings of estheticians. Unity, eternality, vitality, dynamic power, and so on,</page><page sequence="13">INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY 573 still walk with such a swagger that no one is brazen enough to look them in the eye and ask for their credentials. Moreover, certain ideas are taken for granted which are in fact highly dubious. For instance, all of the papers which your reporter was able to hear as- sumed that "art" was univocal. Again, all of the papers talked of "the artist" as philosophers talk of "the physicist," or "the man in the street," or "the Greeks," though their authors must have known that different artists have different aims and that "the artist" simply doesn't exist and hasn't for at least a hundred and fifty years. So they talked of "the work of art," though works of art are so various in every way that their differences are as important as their similari- ties. Such habits are as deeply ingrained in estheticians as the more repulsive habit of fine writing. Why a man has to lose his sense of humor when writing about works of art is a mystery. The aver- age esthetician writes in a pneumatic style which is flatly grotesque. As an example, read the following sentence from one of the papers in the Congres Descartes, the proceedings of the .Esthetics Congress not having appeared: "Thanks very largely to the two precious channels of communication between otherwise solitary souls, vocal inflections and bodily movements, we are able with effortless ease to animate the inanimate and to humanize the subhuman, to descry the drama of human passion in the face of nature and to listen to its overpowering crescendo in the noblest masterpieces of art." The alliteration, the adjectival inflation- "two precious channels," "ef- fortless ease," "overpowering crescendo," "noblest masterpieces," the mixture of metaphors, the applied decoration, all show the Eng- lish school-boy at his worst. After all the author is merely saying that people can communicate with one another by words and gestures. The animating of the inanimate, the humanizing of the subhuman, and so on, do not make up an exhaustive catalogue of what one can communicate. They are simply a few of the things which the author admires. Your reporter has been more impressed by what the two precious channels fail to communicate and feels, after hearing and observing several hundred vocal inflections and bodily movements, that the most important problem of philosophy is why people write papers. This brings us back to Mr. Valery's remarks on Descartes. They seemed paradoxical at the opening of the Congress; they seem reason- able at its close. For in spite of philosophical dictionaries, philoso- phers persist in using words in any way which suits their fancy; in spite of bibliographies, they appear to read very little; in spite of the prestige of science, they present very little evidence; in spite of the problems which life presents at every turn, they worry over the riddles of the closet. The present and future do not exist for them.</page><page sequence="14">574 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY One of them speaking of modern art disposes of it as " the cult of ugliness, a cult, cold, deliberate, cerebral, and consequently estheti- cally false and illegitimate, which has ended in the blind alley of sur-realist painting and atonal music." Does such a sentence mean more than that the esthetician has failed to meet the problem of modern art? Has not its author allowed his emotions to dominate his understanding? But perhaps philosophy is not written for un- derstanding; perhaps it is written for self-justification. Perhaps the best reason we have for reading is the hope of finding in its phrases the expression of a "magnificent and memorable Ego." GEORGE BOAS. THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
