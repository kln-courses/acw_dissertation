<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRAJÃPATI IN VÈDIC MYTHOLOGY AND RITUAL By J. R. JOSHI Prajãpati appears twice in the BF as an epithet of Savitr1 and of Soma.2 His name as a distinct deity occurs only four times,3 one lute hymn being given to him,4 Prajãpati is rarely anthropomorphised in full form. There is a view that Prajãpati is simply the apotheosis of the notion of creative activity and seems to be identical with the generar tive Agni.5 In the Veda, however, the name is first an abstract epithet, meaning ' protector of the peoples, lord of progeny ' Later in the Veda, the term is brought into connection with the procreative function in nature.6 It is pointed out that the combinations with pati -, as such, are, in the Veda, representatives of a rather ' primitive ' type of appellations.7 The name Prajãpati is derived from prajã ( f . ) and pati ( m. ).8 Prajã , meaning ( i ) procreation ; ( ii ) offspring, Children, descendants ; ( iii ) creatures ; esp. ( iv ) folk, subjects of a prince ; is traced to jan or jã ( be born, produced, come into being9 ) with pra , forward, onward, forth.10 Patit means master ; possessor ; lord ; ruler.11 i IV. 53. 2. 2 IX. 5. 9. 8 X.85. 43, 121. 10, 169. 4, 184. 1. * X. 121. 0 Cf.

As has been pointed out above, the hymn X. 121 is often described as addressed to Prajãpati, and hiranyagarbha is treated as a mere appellative.1 Wallis,2 however, lias pointed out that the last verse of the hymn, in which the name Prajãpati occurs, is not divided up in the pada recension ; this fact and the absence of the refrain would seem to prove the verse a later addition. The hymn is variously dedicated to Hiranyagarbha - the son of Prajãpati, or to Prajãpati or to Ka. It has been suggested in later literature that Ka in this hymn represents Prajãpati. It is also said, therefore, that Prajãpati symbolises' thé endless sign of interrogation.3 But this is obviously an afterthought. What we have in the Hiranyagarbha-Sükta is actually an apotheosis of the interrogative pronoun.4 As has been said above, Prajãpati seems to be connected with the concept of the lord of progeny.* Accordingly, the hemistich from the Hiranyagarbha-Sůkta, which refers to Prajãpati, means : " Prajãpati, you only comprehend 'all these created things ( jãtãni ), and none beside thee". Also in the remaining three occurrences of Prajãpati in the R V, referred to above, that god appears to be specifically connected with prajã. Thus that god is adored to grant the offspring.6 Prajãpati, moreover, is also referred to in that Veda, in the context of the progeny of cows.7 Further/ that god is mentioned more significantly together with the fertility- divinities such as, Visnu, Sinxvãlx.8 The connection between Prajãpati and progeny or progen*ti&lt;ro seems to be referred to also in the A V. In that Veda , Prajãpati ift described as prajayã sarhraranah in the context of the grãmya animals.9 That god is connected with the prajãs also in general.10 Prajãpati, on the other hand, is directly connected with progenation or fertility in the AV. The epithet prajananavãn • is used to denote 1 Cf. for example. Grassmann. Rig-veda II, 398. 2 Cosmology of the Rgveda , 52 fn. 1. 3 Cf.

May they bring hither increase and abundant wealth ! ".5 Similarly, that god is invoked for food,6 strength, fame, etc.7 Further, Ekãstakã is said to be the daughter of Prajãpati.8 The rk from the iF, referred to above, in which Prajãpati is invoked for strength, fame, etc. , occurs as the concluding one in the hymn addressed to the Brhaspati. The same rk , however, occurs in the $F9 with variation and as dedicated to Prajãpati. It is, moreover, significant that the SV 10 ascribes the epithet paramesthl to Prajãpati. Prajãpati occupies a prominent place in the later Samhitãs .n As has been said above, later in the Veda, the term Prajãpati is brought into connection with the procreative function in nature. This we may call his cosmic stage.12 It is pointed out that the Vedic conception of Prajãpati is basic to understand the cosmogonie formulations of the Rsi-s.13 Moreover, through the development of Prajãpati as the creator and the supreme god in the later Vedas, the influence of Varuna waned.14 In this connection, it is significant that the cosmic significance of Prajã- pati is set forth in noble terms, but in no passage of the RV is that god connected with the ethical.15 The developed cosmic significance of Prajãpati as against the waning ethical one of Varuna, in the later Samhitãs , may be observed in the YV. For example, the following passages from the two Samhitãs may be compared : " Whither by day 1 9th rky 17- 18fch hymns. 2 IV. 4. 2. For Patyal's. view, sce fn.

Soma preferred Rohiiiï out of his wives. The other wives turned away from him in anger. Prajãpati. was willing to maintain his daughters thus coming back ; but Soma would not leave them now, since he took a vow to associate himself with them equally. As a result of this he suffered from consumption ".2 Keeping with such a cosmic significance, Agni, Yãyu and Sürya are* called the sons of Prajãpati.3 Similarly it is said that Prajãpati assig- ned food for all the gods.4 In connection with the Prajãpati-mythology represented in the FF, it may also be pointed out that the offerings to Prajãpati are made silently. In this connection a myth is narrated in the TS .5 " Once: there arose a dispute between Mind and Speech regarding their superi- ority. They went to Prajãpati for settling the dispute. He decided in favour of Mind saying that Speech imitates what Mind thinks. Speech being thus defeated, refused to carry oblations to him ". Regarding this myth, it may be said that it is a mythological representation of the paucity of rlcs dedicated to Prajãpati. As for the development of the connection between Prajãpati and the fertility-goddesses, the FF contains the following significant passage : lí Prajãpati entertained immoral intimacy with his daughter Usas. She assumed the form of a red doe. Rudra saw this and discha- rged an arrow ".6 In this connection, it is suggested elsewhere, that the connection of Usas with fertility may be at the root of various myths in which male divinities are said to have been attracted towards her.7 As for the connection between Prajãpati and progenation, the following references from the FF may be compared. In the context of the Aávamedha, reference is made to the ritualistic cohabitation between the queen and the horse.8 And, on the other hand, in the context of the Sautrâmanï , it is said that the king to be crowned is Prajãpati.9 The wider concept of progenation, namely, the cosmic creation seems to be related to Prajãpati in the FF in detail. In this connec- tion, the following passage from the MS 10 may be referred to. " Prajãpati was alone in the beginning. He desired to be many. He became 1 RVI. 24. 10. 2 ran. 3. 5. 8 MS IV. 2. 1Z 4 TS II. 3. 6. « II. 5. 14. » MS IV. 2. 12. 7 Of.

He was troubled by the foetus and became dark. His only life breath ( asu ) remained. From him Asuras ( demons ) were born. He considered them as Pitrs or elders. Thus he produced Pitrs. He then became illumined by the creation of the Pitrs. Then he created the Devas; While he was thinking of something, he created men. Thus gods, demons, manes, and human beings were created by him". Of course, the creation ascribed to Prajäpati in this myth seems to be, in a way, limited one. In this connection, it is significantly said that the world of Prajäpati is ' vibhãn ' that is this world only.1 The creatorsliip of Prajäpati, however, seems to be mythological- ly connected with that of the sacrifice in the FF, the text, which is mainly ritualistic. The importance of Prajäpati in the earlier mythology goes hand in hand with that of the sacrifice in Vedic ritual. In this connection, the following passage seems to be significant : " Prajä- pati created all sacrifices such as Agnihotra, Agnistoma, Ukthya, Daráapaurnamãsa and Atirätra. He then compared Agnistoma with Agnihotra, Ukthya with Paurnamãsl, and Atirätra with Amâvãsyã sacrifice. The sacrifice primarily belonged to Paramesthin. By the performance of that he went to the heaven. So Prajäpati too offered the sacrifice to reach the heaven ".2 It may be recalled here that, in the SV , the epithet paramesthin is ascribed to Prajäpati himself. Any way, in the mythology of the YV, a ritualistic concept, namely, the Sacrifice, seems to have been brought into close connection with Prajäpati. Even Brahman(n), that is the essence of sacrifice is therein equated with Prajäpati.3 Similarly, that god is equated with seventeen syllables of the sacrificial formula. These seventeen syllables are : âárâvaya, astuárausat, yaja, ye yajämahe, vasat.4 Further, the concept of time, which plays a significant role in Vedic ritual, also is directly connected with Prajäpati who is said to be a Samvatsara ( year ). Twelve names of Prajäpati are äpi, sväpi, apija ( born again and again ), rtu, vasu, aharpati ( lord of the day ), mugdha, vinäsin, anyäyat, bhauvana, bhuvanapati and adhipati. The last seven names are the names of the days also.5 While referring to Prajäpati in the ritualistic manner, in the mythology of the YV, that god is peculiarly connected with some other Vedic deities. The following myth, for example, occurs in the TS :® " Once in the mutual conflict the gods were defeated by the Asuras and became their servants. The glory and power departed from them. Indra, seeing this came to Prajäpati, who advised him to perform a sacrifice 1 TS I. 6. 5, 7. 5. 2 Ibid I. 6. 9. 8 VS XXXII. 1. 4 TS 1.6.11. fi VS IX. 20. 6 II. 3. 7. lé [ Annals, B. 0. R, I, ]</page><page sequence="6">106 Annals of the Èhanâarkar Oriental Èesearch institute Next, in the Brãhmanas, comes more ritualistic stage of Prajã- pati, where he becomes, to quote Oldenberg's1 words, " an apex to the Pantheon set up by the priesthood, a god moving to and fro with each breeze of fantasy ' It has been said - and more or less rightly so - that the prominent place which Prajãpati occupies in the later Samhitãs and the Brãhmanas appears in a great measure to be due to two reasons. Firstly, because he was identified with sacrifice, and secondly, because he came to be identified with the Brahman(n).2 It is also said that the Brahmano, period was the golden age of the institution of sacrifice and Prajãpati played a very prominent role in the foundation and develop- ment of this institution.3 A wide range of interpretations for Prajãpati is proposed in the Brãhmana literature. The importance of that god in the Brãhmana religion becomes clear from the bewildering number of those identifi- cations. Thus he is identified with Agni merely ; or with Agni the Purusa, or with Agni and Savitr. In some places he is identified with Yajfìa or with yajña and Samvatsara, or with yajña and Soma, or with yajña as the food of the gods ( devãnãm annam ). He is also said to bave become Daráapürnamasa, or is said to be sacrifice ( malcha ) himself, ór the sacrifices Moreover he is identified with samvatsara, the year and his lights, Vãyu, all metres, the moon, these three worlds, the quarters, antariksa, saptadaáa-stoma, manas, dhätr, the sacrificial victim, Savitr's suparna, the whole Brahman, and what not. He is not only man ; he is both men as well as gods ; nay he is every thing endowed with breath. He is even death.4 It is suggested that these interpreta- tions, although divergent, are admissible from the esoteric point of view which is both pantheistic and monotheistic as is so often the case with other Vedic deities.5 One may not, however, read too much in the identifications of Prajãpati in the Brãhmanas . Therefore, the view that Prajãpati is the name of the supreme god6 may not be accepted. Similar is the view that Prajãpati of the Brãhmana period has paved the way for Brahman of the Upanisads and Brabmadeva of the Purãnas .7 In fact, it is Brhaspati who has paved the way for Brahman of the * Weltanschauruny , der Brãhmana-texte , 32 ; also cf.

Upanisads } Reading rather too much in Prajäpati of the Brãhmanas, it is also said that, in fact, Prajäpati would appear to be responsible for creation, sustenance as also destruction of the universe, as may be evident from his identification with Sacrifice, Vãyu and Death.2 Keith,8 however, rightly says : " The Brãhmanas , in Prajäpati, do not find complete satisfaction for their view of construction of the universe Another exaggerated picture of Prajäpati, of course based on the Brãhmanas , is put forth by Roy4 who says : " We have equated Hindu Bhakti-god with Prajäpati in order that Samsärika life may be accepted as something instinct with inherent mobility and grace In this connection, Devasthali5 rightly says : " The concept of Prajäpati is rather too vague for any definite personification unlike Visnu or Rudra." That scholar adds : " This had its natural result. For, when sacrifice began to crumble under its own weight of details and the idea of devo- tion began to take root, it was but natural that this concept, which was rather hard for and almost aloof from anthropomorphism, receded into back-ground and gave place to the more anthropomorphic deities like Visnu and Rudra, the deities round whom arose in course of time the whole net-work of Vaisuavism and Šaivism. " Prajäpati, therefore, may not be said to have achieved the position of the Bhakti-god. It is, of course, a fact that the Brãhmanas attempt to identify that god with other deities. For, the following passage is found in the Bau-Ss .6 : " It is said in the Brãhmana-texts that Prajäpati is ( equivalent to ) all divinities. " It does not mean, however, that " various earlier divinities óf a more or less abstract and specialistic character are blended in this product ".7 After having critically examined the Brãhmanas , and having left aside mere bandhutã statements, it may be said thab those texts do refer to Prajäpati in various aspects. On the back-ground of the earlier mythology, some of these references seem to be confirmatory. For example, the Brãhmanas speak of the connection between Prajäpati and the generative power or progeny. Similar is the suggestion made in the following passage from the 8Br.s : " The bull is the Prajäpati® among cows." It is also said in the same Brãhmana10 that Prajäpati represents productiveness. In this connection, moreover, the Tãn-Br1L contains 1 Cf. Joshi, Minor Divinities in Vedic Mythology and Ritual ( a thesis ), pp. 62-63, * Cf.

He saw this saman; changing himself into a borse, he sniffed at them,1 ( then ) they procreated themselves. This sãman is a (means of) procreation". On the back-ground of the earlier mythology, it may be observed that the both horse and bull, identified with Prajãpati, are often connected with virile power Accordingly, it is said in the ŠBr2 that Prajãpati is the most vigorous of the gods. Further, the productiveness of that god is peculiarly suggested in the following passage : " Once after creation Prajãpati considered himself empty, like a cow from whom milk is extracted. So he saw the árayanti sãman and got equipped with progeny, cattle and strength In such descriptions the milk of a cow, as it were, corresponds to the procreative seed of Prajãpati. It is, indeed, said that Prajãpati produced creatures from his generative organ.3 This passage may be compared with the Ajyadohas4 or the 'milkings'5 of ( = crea- tions by ) Prajãpati. Another aspect of the character of Prajãpati, confirmed in the mythology of the Brãhmanas, is revealed through the connection of that god with Varuna and Brhaspati. As has been pointed out above, it may be said that reference is made to the cosmic ethical significance of Varuna as against purely cosmic one of Prajãpati. In this light the following passage from the KBr .6 may be referred to: " Once the offsprings of Prajãpati ate the barley of Varutia. So he grasped them with his nooses. Prajãpati, their father, saw the rite Varuna-praghãsas. Having sacrificed with it Varuna was delighted and freed them from his nooses and from all evil". In this connection, it may be said that the divinities like Prajãpati, Brhaspati, Vãstospati, etc. denote a particular trait in Vedic mythology. In a way, they are artificially created. Brhaspati, for example, was. artificially created to counteract the growing hyper-glorification of the military prowess.7 Similarly, the concept of the father of creatures may be said to have originated in some mythological reasoning. Brhaspati represents the pači-hood8 in respect of the priestcraft, whereas Prajãpati indicates that in respect of the offspring or creatures. Just as Brhaspati is originally connected with brahman, so is Prajãpati a product of thought.9 The Brãhmanas , 1 A case of the « sniff kiss'; cp. Tãn-Br VII. 10. 15.

In the Vamsa-Br,1 for example, it is said that Prajãpati received the Sãmaveda from Brahma.2 In this connection, the following passage from the GBr 3 seems to be more significant : In that Brahma said to Atharvan : ' Having created the beings of Prajãpati, protect them therefore Prajãpati came into being".4 Also according to the JBr ,5 Brahinã created Prajãpati. Thus, it seems that in the mythology of the Brãhmanas Prajãpati is connected with Varuna and Brhaspati with some special significance. Keith6 has rightly pointed out that Prajãpati is the hero of cosmogonie myths of the whole of the Brãhmana- period. However, his view that the choosing of Prajãpati as the symbol of unity is one of the most striking proofs of great influence of the RV upon the period of the Brãhmanas , is difficult to be accepted. For, in the RVt it is Varuna and not Prajãpati, who is chosen ag the symbol of unity.7 One of the aspects of cosmogonie myths of the Brãhmanas is the connection bet- ween Prajãpati and Apah. It has been pointed out above that Prajãpati as the ť vigorous stallion ' or as the ' fertilising rain-cloud ' was brought into connection with the waters already in the A V.8 It is shown elsewhere how the procreating power of the Apah, like that of the 1 II. 33.

That scholar, in this context, notes that Prajãpati at A V ( S ) IV. 4. 2 is described as an originator of the world and creator of beings. This significance attached to the A V - passage however, is difficult to understand. Bhavsar ( Etymology in the Brãhmanas , a thesis, 465-66 ) refers to the etymology prajã + pã ( - ti ) as a case of a regular ( pratyahsa ) primary derivation based on ritual and mythology, satisfying grammatical requirements.

SBr ,2 for exemple, while narrating the order of the creation of the universe, points ont that first there was water everywhere. These waters desired to reproduce themselves. They toiled and became heated with fervent devotion. A golden egg was produced from them and remained floating for one year. At the end of the year Prajãpati, a man, was produced from them. Thus he was born of the primeval waters. It is significant that in this myth Prajãpati is called purusa* as against the female character of Apah. In the TBr,4 however, the connection between Prajãpati and 5pah takes altogether different form. It is said therein that in the beginning there was no land ; everywhere there was water. So Prajãpati wept. His tears fell down. They became the solid earth. That Brãhmana5 gives this account also differently in the following manner : There were flowing waters in the beginning. Prajãpati toiled with them. He then thought of creating the world* Just then a lotus leaf came out of the water.6 He thought that there must be the earth supporting this leaf. He assumed the form of a boar and dived down the waters. He pierced the earth by means of his tusk and took it out. He then spread it on the lotus leaf. This was the earth.7 This myth has a different version in the SBr.s It is said therein that Prajãpati was alone here in the beginning. He desired, 'May I exist; may I reproduce myself'. He toiled and practised penance ( became heated ). From his heat,, the waters were produced and by the process of solidification of water, the earth came into existence. In this manner, the connection between Prajãpati and the female divinity Apah is an aspect of the cosmogonie myths of the Brãhmanas. Another aspect of the cosmogonie myths of the Brãhmanas is the connection between Prajãpati and Usas, the connection which was already referred to in the YV. According to Pandey,9 Usas of the Brãhmanas develops in the form of the first female principle. That scholar, in this connection, adds that in Indian cosmogony first place is 1 Cf. Joshi, op. cit. y 388. 2 XI. 1. 6. 1-2. 8 For the Prãna-Puruça-Prajãpati concept, cf.

This male has been thought to require á female to procreate and then the Female must be imagined to have sprung from this Male, who is regarded the first and foremost cause of the creation. This Male unites with Female which is considered to be produced by him and thus, according to Pandey, the cosmogonie ideas imply the idea of incest. On this back-ground reference may be made to the story elaborately stated in the SBr1: " Prajãpati entertained passion for his own daughter either the sky or the dawn (Usas ). He united with her. This was certainly a sin in the eyes of the gods, who thought that he had committed a grave sin. The gods then asked Rudra to pierce him. Rudra pierced him. Half of his seed fell on the ground. The gods caused the seed to germinate. When the anger of the gods subsided, they cured him and cut out the dart from his body. Now Prajãpati, being the sacrifice, the gods could not afford to lose even his smallest portion, as the sacrifice would suffer danger due to the part of the dart in the Prajâpati's body. Various gods tried their hands to preserve that pàrt of his body from decay. At last, under the impulse of Savitr, when Brhaspati2 looked at it, it did not injure him ". It is suggested that, in this legend, the idea of punishment for immorality is markedly emphasised.3 May he be anybody, Prajãpati or any other, he is to be punished for violating the sacred order. Also Godbole,4 in the context of this myth, says : " Thus it appears that in order to keep Prajâpati's purity in tact the gods unanimously made an effort to get rid of Prajâpati's incarnation of sin". According to some scholars5 this myth of Prajãpati has a reference to an astronomical event, viz. the precession of vernal equinox:, which was the beginning of the year. This, of course, is an afterthought. Similar unconvincing is the view that it is a myth directly concerned with ritual performance or the natural phenomena of the Sun and Dawn.6 In the II ( SBr ) version of the story it is said that Prajãpati transformed himself into a rœ-buck and approached his own daughter who had assumed the shape of a doe. The gods fashioned a divine being called Bhutavat (Rudra) out of their most fearful forms in order to punish him Tor his incestuous deed. When he was pierced by the arrow he bounded up to the sky where he became the constellation Mrga (Orion) while his daughter became the asterism Rohinï. The arrow i II. 1 and I. 7. 4. 2 This reference to the signficant connection between Prajãpati and Brhaspati may be compared with the passages from the Brãhmanas in which Prajãpati is connected with Brhaspati in the name of Brahma. 8 Cf.

In the Tãn-Br2 the legend is very briefly stated : " Prajäpati longed for his daughter Usas. His semen fell on the ground. The earth nourished it so that it should not be spoiled. It produced the cattle ".2 Thus, after having originated in the FF, and having been expressed through various modes, the connection between Prajäpati and Usäö seems to have been confirmed in the SBr 4 which describes that in the creation of the universe fancied as the sacrifice Prajäpati was the Grha- pati and Usas was his mistress. The Prajãpati-Usas myth, of course, represents an aspect of the connection of that god with female divinities. The concept of creation, which is an aspect of Prajãpati-Usas myth, was used, already in the FF, as a joining factor between Prajä- pati and sacrifice or Agni. In developing that trait, mythology and ritual go hand in hand, as far as the Brãhmanas are concerned. In the SBr,5 for example, it is said: "Prajäpati is Agni's father and son. Agni restored him to his normal body, therefore he is called the father of Prajäpati. " Elsewhere in the same text, it is said regarding Prajäpati that the sacrifice is his main strength, and he is also born of the sacrifice.6 Moreover, the following passage from the TBr 7 is signi- ficant in this connection There was 'nothing* before the creation. From that Asat were produced smoke, Agni, flame, lustre, blaze and huge flame. All these became solidified and constituted the abode of the creator. The urethra was burst open and it became the ocean. Then the whole world was created. Thé Asat again reflected. It created mind, which created Prajäpati, who then produced all creatures''. The motif of connecting the idea of creation with both Prajäpati and Agni may be found in the Brãhmanas where Prajäpati is often identified with the sacrifice,8 thus : " Prajäpati is none but Agni himself." ;9 " He is as large as the sacrifice, as wide as its extent " - Kuruksetra is describ- ed to be the altar of Prajäpati ; 10 "A bunch of the darbhas form the source of Prajäpati ".n 1 Cf.

A significant designation of Prajãpati in the Brãhmanas is Tüsinm, that is Silence as opposed to Vãk or Speech. Vãk is, according to Agra WALA,1 the symbol of the material world and the immortal reality underlying all matter is that aspect of Vãk which is referred to in the RV as Thousand-syllabled existing in the highest heaven. So as to indicate ' the true meaning ' of Tüsnim , that scholar adds : " Prajãpati is upãmáu or Tüsnim, namely Silence or the unmanifest source of all that is becoming manifest/'2 It may be recalled, however, that the "paucity of rks dedicated to Prajãpati is indicated through the myth of Mind and Speech in the YV . The expression manasã , c with the mind '3 occurring in the said myth may be said to be developed in the epithet tüsnim or upãmsi &amp;, ritualistically. In this connection it is said in the ¿Br4 that whatever at the sacrifice is performed for Prajãpati, that is performed in a low voice (upãmáu ). Upãmáu is, of course, a method of the utterance Prajãpataye svãhã. It is significant that both the expres- sions, tüsnim and manasã are connected with Prajãpati in the follow- ing passage from the Sãmavidhãn-Br : 5 brahma vã idamagra ãslt | tasya tejo raso' ty ar icy ata ' sa brahmã samabhavat I sa tüsnim mana8ãdhyãyat I tasya yanmana âsït sa prajãpatirabhavat i. Thus, it may be said that the origin of the expressions upãmsu an&lt;J tüsnim used in connection with Prajãpati, may better be found in the shadowy figure of that god in the mantras 6 as compared with that in the Brãhmanas* Further, like the concept of Tùsiiïm Prajãpati, the concept of Purusa-Prajãpati also was developed in many ways in the Brãhmanas . Reference may be made, in this connection, to the view of Griswold7 who says : " Prajãpati fits into a pantheistic scheme almost as well as Purusa; and with neither Purusa nor Prajãpati is polytheism inconsi- stent In the context of a creation-myth it has been already under- lined above that the epithet purusa is significantly ascribed to Prajãpati. 1 Vedic Lectures , 128. 2 Ibid , 133.

L ]</page><page sequence="14">114 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute It seems, however, that the Brãhmanas , before arriving at the identifi- cation between Prajãpati and Purusa, put forth some mythological justification to that effect. This is done in twofold way : either sacrifice or man is used as a medium. In the first case, for instance, the S Br1 contains the following passage : " Seven Rsis that became manifest from the non-existing state were the seven vital breaths. The central vital breath kindled activity2 in other breaths. These , enkindled seven breaths created seven separate Purusas. As these separated seven Purusas were in- capable of effective creation, they joined themselves into one Purusa, comprising in himself all glory of Šrí. This one Purusa was Prajãpati. This Prajãpati was the same as Agni. Then he created Brahman(n.) It may be recalled, in this connection, that in the FF, Prajãpati was already equated with sacrifice as the creator. Further, according to the Brãhmana ,3 "The creation of the universe is also a great sacrifice. Prajãpati offers himself in this sacrifice. That means the whole universe has come out of him, the Purusa Secondly, Prajãpati is brought into connection with Purusa, in the sense of 'man'. According to a legend which occurs in the JBr* the seed of Prajãpati fell on the mountain Himavat and became mãnusa. This legend may be compared with the following passage from the SBr 5 : " Manu is also another name of Prajãpati. His wife is this earth ". Further, according to that Brãhmana ,8 even though Prajã- pati is the lord of all creatures, a man* is nearest to him. In this connection, there is an interesting passage : " Prajãpati is twenty-one- fold. In this respect he is like a man who has ten fingers and ten toes of hands and feet respectively and a body ".7 It is, therefore, said : "Prajãpati is the man, Purusa".8 In this connection, Agrawala,® rightly indeed, says : " It may well be said that there is nothing higher than Man in creation. Man is the supreme consideration Thus, through the medium of sacrifice or man the concept of Purusa-Prajãpati is justified in the Brãhmanas. And hence the occurrence of the passages like the following one : " Purusa, this Prajãpati was produced from the golden egg ( in the beginning ) ".10 i VI. l. i. 1-8. 2 Ji(n)dh. 3 ¿ Br X. 2. 1. 1. * HI. 261. f. 5 XIV. 1. 3. 25. 6 V. 1. 3. 8. * ŠBr VI. 2. 2. 4. 8 Ibid VII. 4. 1. 15. 0 Opè cit., 129. 10 XI. 1. 6. 2 ; Regarding the passages from the Vi§nu-P.

Agrawala,1 who equates that concept with Centre, says : " Prajãpati as the centre symbolises the principle of Rest. All motion proceeds from a source that is at rest. This aspect of Prajãpati is an unknown quantity symbolically referred to as Ka Ka, according to that scholar, corresponds to the algebrical expression x. This is, however, unconvincing. The right view, in this connection, is put forth by Max Muller,2 according to whom, the authors of the Brãhmanas had so completely broken with the past that, forgetful of the poetical character of the hymns and the yearning of the poets after the unknown God, they exalted the interrogative pronoun itself into a deity, and acknowledged a god Ka or Who. This view of Max Muller may very well be supported even from the general tone of the myths centred round the concept of Ka-Prajãpati. The TBr,z for example, contains the following passage : " Prajãpati created Indra at the end of the gods. He sent him out as their chief. The gods did not recognise him as such. He came back to him. Indra asked for the lustre from him. He gave it to him on the condition that he will be known as Ka This passage may be compared with the following one from the Tãn-Br 4 which be- gins with : " Once Prajãpati thought that his speech should become manifold So Yãk produced from this unmanifest principle5 enveloped him by words "justas water from the clouds pervades " the ground. So Yak became VedicScriptural and Ordinary. " From this third part designated as Ka he created the earth, the mid-region and the heaven And, in a myth from the A Br,6 like that from the TBr , Indra has been brought into the picture in connection with Ka-Prajãpati, as follows : " Indra after having slam Vrtra and remained victor in varions battles, said to Prajãpati, ' I will have thy rank, that of the supreme deity ; I will be great ! ' Prajãpati said, ' who am I ( Koaham ) ? ' Indra answered, 'just what thou hast told ( i. e. kah, who ? ) Thence Prajãpati received the name kah, who ? Prajãpati is ( the god ) kah, who ? " These are the myths which may be referred to for the justification behind the identi- fication of Prajãpati with Ka, often found in the Brãhmanas.7 It has been pointed out above in the context of the myths concern- ing Ka-Prajãpati, that Indra, some how or other, is connected with Prajãpati. To bring Prajãpati in close contact with a major god like Indra is, of course, a development in the Prajãpati-mythology. Refere- nce may also be made, in this connection, to the concept of Savitr 1 Op. cit. 125. 2 Ancient Sanskrit Literature , 334. 8 II. 2. 10. 1-6. * XX. 14. 2. 6 Cf.

Ritualistic details, on the contrary, seem to have been connected with Prajãpati, not for the glorification of tbe latter, but for that of the former. For example, it is said in the TBr 2 : " Prajãpati brushed all sweat from his forehead. That became, ghrta (ghee )". Prajãpati is brought into connection with almost all sacrificial dealings so that their significance enhances with divine touch as it were. Accordingly, the following passage is found in the ABr :3 "If we have failed, by omission or, improper application, or by excess, of what is required, all that may go ( be taken away ) to ( our ) father, who is Prajãpati ". " For, " according to the Brahmana , "all creatures are born after Prajãpati. He, therefore, is the shelter from what is deficient, or in excess ; and thence these two faults do no harm to the sacrificers ". In this manner, it is interesting to note that, as far as the Brahmanas are concerned, mythological connection of Prajãpati with gods seems to glorify Prajãpati, while ritualistic relations of that god seem to glorify ritual or the sacrificer. In the Ãranyakas , however, Prajãpati-mythology seems to have received a set-back, on account of the gradual decline of the institution of sacrifice. The Ãranyakas , of course, do refer to some important aspects of Prajãpati-mythology, as expressed in the earlier texts. In a way, the Ãranyakas confirm some earlier traits in this respect. One of such traits is the connection between Prajãpati and Brahmã. In the éãn-Ãf in the context of ' the Path of the knower after Death the following passage occurs : " He arrives at the unconquerable palace. The splendour of Brahman reaches him. He arrives at Iudra and Prajãpati, the door-keepers. They flee from him This is how the Ãranyakas refer to Prajãpati together-with Brahmã and Indra, as is found also earlier, but these texts ascribe to Brahmã considerably higher position. Reference may also be made, in this context, to an account occurring in the TÃ .5 " It happened that Prãjãpatya Sruui Suparneya6 approached the father ( of the race ) Prajãpati with the question : ť What the reverends ( viz. wise ones ) pronounce to be the highest ? ' "7 This account seems to conclude that Brahmã is the Prajjã-pati. in true sense of the term. 1 TBr II. 3. 10. 1-3. 2 II. 1. 2. 0. 8 V. 24. 4 III. 5. 6 X. 63. 6 According to Sãyana ( Comm. on. the TÄ ), Ãruni is the son of Prajãpati and Suparnã. Deussen ( Sechzig Upaniçad's des Veda , 255, fn. 2 ) prefers the meaning of the term as : the son of Aruna Suparna ( in the B V a name of the Sun ) and the descendant of Prajãpati. 7 Translated from Deussen's book, pp. 255-56»</page><page sequence="17">Prajãpati in Vedic Mythology and Ritual 117 Another significant aspect of Prajãpati-mythology, which is again confirmed in the Aranyakas , is the connection of that god with progena- tion. In the 1 Samhitä Upanisad ' section of the Sãn-Ã? for example, the following passage occurs : " The wife is the symbol of the former, the husband of the latter. The son is the union,2 says Sthavira Šakalya. This is the Prajãpati union In the expression : prajãpatih prajayã Bamvidãnah ,3 moreover, this significance is clearly brought out. To- gether with this the following passage from the may be read : " Then, when he ( = the performer ) consorts5 with his wife, let him touch her heart, ( saying ), 4 what in thy fair heart rests within Prajã- pati0 through that, O mistress of immortality, mayest thou never weep for misfortune to thy children Her children die not before her ". Then, when coming back after absence, moreover, a father embraces his son ( saying ), " Even as Prajãpati embraced creatures for their safety, so do I embrace thee, N. N. ".7 In this manner, the Ãranyakas pecu- liarly refer to the original connection between Prajãpati and offspring. The concept of Purusa-Prajãpati is another important aspect of the Prajãpati-mythology referred to in the Aranyakas. On the back- ground of the mythology of the BrõÂmanas , the following passage from the TÄ 6 may be significantly referred to : " All this was ( as ) the waters - nothing but water. Prajãpati alone was born in a lotus-leaf. In his mind there arose ( sam^/vrt ) a desire : May I create ( */srj ) this ( world ). Therefore whatever a person approaches with the mind9 he says that with words ; he does 'that with deeds... He suffered pain10 voluntarily ( heated himself, underwent austerities ).

The Purusa appeared (udy/sthã) becoming thousand-headed, thousand-eyed and thousand- footed. He told him, "Verily you sprang up (were born) before ( me). Being elder ( born before ), you make ( kr ) this ( world ) ". He having taken water from here placed it ( the brick in-water ) in the front with his palm ".4 A critical study of this Ãranyaka- passage may indicate that the concept of Purusa -Prajãpati, was becoming again divided into two : the old divinities, Purusa and Prajãpati.® It also may be noticed that Purusa is supposed to be ' the elder ' than Prajãpati. Does this indicate the growing importance of Purusa ? In the Upanisads earlier pre-eminence of Prajãpati rapidly disappears. The mention of him there is of a god, ... a ' somewhat shadowy and uninteresting member of the Vedic Pantheon'.® As compared with the sheer philosophic That Only, the one thing without humanly definable quality, Prajãpati cuts a sorry figure, and marks a backward movement.7 Godbole,8 however, thinks that Prajãpati holds the second rank after Brahman in the hierarchy of gods in the Upanisadic philosophy. He adds : " Sometimes there appears to be a very thin line of demarcation between Prajãpati and Brahman - but on the whole there are several duties and functions entrusted to Prajãpati which in the Epic and the Puranic period are attributed to Brahmadeva". According to that scholar, Prajãpati of the Upanisadic period, thus, is a precursor of Brahmadeva of the post- Vedic literature. As a matter of fact, however, it is Brahmã who may be called a precursor of Brahma- deva of the post-Vedic literature.9 It is significant to point out that the Upanisads also give emphasis on the original connection between Prajãpati and progenation.

Hence proceeds seed, and from it these creatures are born. Those therefore who observe this rule1 of Prajãpati, produce a pair It is said, moreover, in the same text2 : " Prajãpati ( the lord of creatures ) was desirous of creatures ( prajäh ). He performed penance ( or he meditated ), and having performed penance, he produced a pair, matter ( rayi ) and spirit (prána ), thinking that they together should produce creatures for him in many ways ".3 As has been pointed out above, in the Upanisads Brahman still occupies a higher position than Prajãpati does. For example, the first Upanisadic passage referred to above is concluded with the statement that those who observe the rule of Prajãpati, to them belongs the Brahma-world. It is said, rather more clearly, that Brahman produced Prajãpati,4 Prajãpati the Devas ( gods ).6 In this connection, the following question together with the answer, is quite significant : 'In what then are the worlds of Prajãpati woven, like warp and woof ? ' ' In the worlds of Brahman 'e Similar is the indication of the statement that a hundred blessings in the world of Prajãpati make one blessing in the world of Brahman.7 In this manner, Brahman , so to say, supersedes Prajãpati in the Upanisads. In the Šrauta sütras, however. Prajãpati seems to be represented in various aspects which were especially developed in the earlier ritualistic texts. Original association of that god with the concept of procreation, for example, is significantly referred to in the #mw¿a-texts. In the context of the Agnihotra offerings, for example, a sacrificer is enjoined to offer an oblation on the gãrhapatya with, iAa prajãm janayatu Prajãpatih.8 Reference may also be made to one of the expia- tion-rites described in the following passage from the Bhãr-é 9 : If a sacrificer, having taken up the vow of celibacy, approaches a woman for sexual pleasure, offering of a wild ass should be made to Prajãpati. Here, sexual pleasure, being a part of progenation, seems to be connected ritualistically with Prajãpati. In the context of one of the various Kãmya sacrifices, moreover, it is stated that one who is desirous of progeny, should offer cooked gar mut- grains to Prajãpati.10 With the similar significance, Prajãpati seems to have been connected with Visnu11 in the Säkamedha-parvan in which the sacrificer is enjoined to recite 1 As laid down íd I. 13, namely, " Those who unite in love by day waste their spirit, but to unite in love by night is right 2 I. 4. 8 Translation by Max Müller, The Upanisads 11,272. 4 Here exDlained bv the commentator as Virai. * Br-UV.5. 1. 6 Ibid III. 6. 1. 7 Ibid IV. 3. 33, also TU II. 8. 1. 8 Ãáá - árautakoêa ( English ), 140. 8 árautakoêa ( English ) [ i¡K ], 441.

As an optional sacrifice, it is told in the tfrawto-texts3 that, when a bull becomes impotent in respect of cows ( that is, when it becomes old ) an ottering of an old bull should be made to Prajãpati. More clearly it is specifically pointed out that Tvast?4 and Prajãpati are the divinities of an uncastrated bull.8 Also in the Kãmya, sacrifices, offered for Brahman- splendour6 or for one who is desirous of lustre,7 Prajãpati receives a bull. More interes- ting is the Kãmya sacrifice in which an offering of a barren cow's organs is made with manaso havih asi Prajãpateh varnah .8 It is natural that the connection between Prajãpati and Agni is put forth in ritualistic manner. Admitting that fiire in flames is the true form of Agni, the following passage from the Agnihotra- section of the Bhãr-S 9 may be referred to : " It is said that the agnihotra of that sacrificer is offered to Prajãpati himself whose agnihotra is offered when the fuel is burned to coals which then catch a flame ,'.10 Likewise, an actual rite of offering seems to have been significantly connected with Prajãpati in the Antyesti as in the following passage from the Gautama - Pitrmedha 11 : "Taking twelve spoonfuls of clarified butter, the per- former should touch the dead body and the fire with left hand, and bringing Prajãpati to the mind he should offer from the southern side". In the context of the expiation-rites, moreover, the same close connec- tion between Prajãpati and the sacrifice in general seems to have been referred to. The Bau-8t12 for example, has the following passage : " If the sacrificer has become old or is otherwise incapacitated to offer the agnihotra , with the formulas relating to agnihotra- oblations, and meditating upon Prajãpati, he should partake of as milk as is usually offered as agnihotra oblation ". The Vãrãha-Parisista1* adds, " He should not partake of anything else ...

So, indeed, did Prajäpati say Similar association of Prajäpati is said to be with the Anvãhãrya cooked rice. After the anvãhãrya has been placed within the altar, the sacrifieer is enjoined to follow it with prajãpaterbhãgo1 si ... prajãpatiraham tvayã sãksãd rdhyãsam .2 Further, it may be observed that Prajäpati is connected with some ritua- listic details rather in a general way as against some special relation- ships. For example, an officiating priest is enjoined to receive a female or an elephant or a male or land or any other living being or grains or culti- vated land, as a daksinã with prajãpataye tvã I 3 The variety of things connected with Prajäpati in this passage indicates how several sacrificial entities were glorified by showing their connection with that god, some how or other. Accordingly, as one of the duties of the Hotr in connec- tion with the Anuyãja it is enjoined that he should hold his folded hands upon the barhis and make up for deficiencies with yajña ¿am ca ma upa ca me prajãpate yajña yatte nyûnam yad %b tetirilctam karma prajãpatau yajña tat | 4 Moreover, if there occurs any transposition in respect of sacrificial .procedure, as an expiation-rite, an oblation is made with prajãpataye svãhã , hiranyagarbhãya svãhã I6 On the background of the concept of Upãmáu or Tûsnïm Prajäpati found in the Brãhmanas , it is interesting to refer to the ritualistic development of that concept occurring in the Šrauta- texts. In the context of the Agnihotra-ofíerings, it is said that whenever one has to -offer oblations without uttering any mantra , one should meditate upon Prajäpati, that is, one should utter the word prajãpataye mentally and the word svãhã in a low tone.6 Reference may also be made to one of the Agnihotra offerings which is made with Prajãpataye svãhã , recited in a low tone.7 It has been specifically said in the Bau-S ,8 in the context of the Pindapitr yajña, that puronuvãicyã and yãjyã in the sacrifice to Frajäpati should be recited in a low tone. Also in connection with the Aghãra libation to Prajäpati it is said that it should be offered mentally reciting Prajãpataye svãhã i9 - Or, it is said that the sacri- 1 Ibid, SO. 2 Mãn-S-SK 390, Vãr-S-SK, 391. 8 Mãn-S-SK, 965. 4 Bau-Š-ŠK, 405. 6 Ibid, 477. 6 Ibid, 136.

Taking into consideration the identification between Ka and Prajãpati, it may be pointed out that according to the Šan-Š* in all the cases, verses relating to an offering to Ka, should be recited in a low tone. In this manner, the concept of Upãmáu-Prajãpati is rituali- stically referred to in the érauta-sütras. As has been said above, the element of time is connected, through that relating to a sacrifice, with Prajãpati, in the mythology of the YV. Reference is also made there to twelve months and twelve names of Prajãpati. That number is connected with Prajãpati also in ritual. In a sacrifice to be offered for one who is desirous of lustre, for example, a bull is said to be offered to Prajãpati in the twelfth month.4 In a sacrifice offered to that god for cattle, brahmaudana is cooked in twelve pots and twelve boons each are given to the priests.6 In the sacrifice for brahman splendour, a bull to Prajãpati is offered at the end of the year.6 Reference has been already made above to the number twelve of the spoonfuls of clarified butter often offered to Prajãpati. Curiously enough, through the medium of the element of time, Prajãpati is also brought into connection with a full span of life. In the Isti called Ãyuh , for example, the following passage^ occurs : " If one desires to live the whole span of life, he should offer a hundred krsnalas to Prajãpati".7 Just as the number twelve suggests the concept of a year so does the number hundred in respect of the concept of the whole span of the life. The latter concept, ho.wever, might have been prevalent even in the Brãhmana period. For, the Bau- 8s contains the following passage : " It is said in the Brãhmana : For one, who fears death,, one should offer a hundred krsnalas to Prajãpati". Following this Brã» hmanat as an expiation-rite, one is enjoined to make an oblation with prajãpatirvisvalcarmã tasya mano devam yajííena rãdhyãsam , etc. , if fear overtakes him within or outside the fire hall.9 The following passage from the Bhãr-P%trmedha10 seems to be more clear in this respect : "If a sacrificer is about to die, but later on, the danger of death disappears, an offering of a hundred krsnalas should be made to Prajãpati ". In this manner, the connection between sacrifice and the element of time was developed into that between Prajãpati and the span of life or death. i BKar-Š-ŠK , 331-32. 2 ŠK, 366. • Ibid, 709. 4 Man-Š V. 2. 10. 44-45. ¡ŠK&gt; 887-88. 6 Mãn-S V. 2. 10. 8-11, (¡K, 888-89. ® ßau'S- ŠKy 890. î Ap'Š~SK,5 64. 8 XIII. 23-^a, 617« 9 Äp'S~sK,m.

One such important aspect is the connection of tliat god with progeny. In the context of the Pravadanakarma , for example, the following significant mantra occurs in the Vãr-G1 : prajãpatiryo vasati prajãsu prajãstanvate sumanasyamãnãh ' sa imãh prajã2 ramayatu prajãtyai svayarh ca no ramatãm èám dadhãnah 3 n It is significant to observe, moreover, that an animal-offering is to be made to Prajãpati by a girl before her marriage.4 Reference may also be made to the following injunction regarding the sacrifice to be made after a son is born to the sacrificer : sahiranyakãrhsye 5 sampãtãnavanayeddhiranyagarbhah samvatsarasya pratimãm kãya svãhã, etc.6 Equally significant is the following injunction laid down for a bridegroom : prajãpatimanusmrtya dharma- prajãsidhyartham kanyãm pratigrhnãmlti prabrüyät 7 ' In this manner, the Grhyasütras refer occasionally to the original connection between Prajãpati and the concept of procreation. The formula from the Kãth-G , referred to above, is significant also in view of the development of the concept of Ka-Prajãpati. The remaining part of the formula is as follows : kasmai svãhã katamasmai svãhã prajãpataye svãhã ' Some aspects of the character of Prajãpati as the creator are ritualistically referred to in the Grhyasütras. As for the place where the offering to Prajãpati should be made, for example, the following injunc- tion occurs in the Bhar-Š8 : brahmane svãhã prajãpataye svãheti madhye I This passage may be compared with that occurring in the context of the Ãcamanavidhi : añgusthe agnih pradesinyãrh vãyuh madhye prajãpatih anãmikãyãm brahmã 0 kanisthikãyãmindrah I10 Similar may be the significance of the following sütra occurring in the context of the Devayajña : prajãpataya iti garbhagçhe ( balim haret')u Taking into account the passage from the SBrt referred to above, in which Rohinx, a Naksatra, is said to be the daughter of Prajãpati, it may be significant to note that, in the Sãú-G ,12 Prajãpati is said to be the presiding deity of that Naksatra. This, of course, refers to the * XXII. 4 ; Cf. AgO II. 6. 4. 2 V. 1. imãm prajãm. 8 v. 1, sandadhãtanah . 4 Cf. Kãth-0 XIX. 3. s v. 1. kãth8e. 6 Kãth-G XXXIV". 4, î ÄOP I. 20. 8 III. 13.

Another creation-myth, in which seven sages are involved, is referred to above. That myth also seems to have been referred to in the JO 1 as follows : tadvã etatprajãpatih saptarçibhyah provãca I Earlier close connection between Prajäpati and sacrifice also seems to be referred to in the Grhyasütras in their particular manner. Prajäpati and the fires or prayers for example, are compared with Gandharva and the Apsa rases in the following passage from the Ãg-G : 2 prajãpatirviévakarmã mano gandharvastasyarksãmãnyap * saraso vahnayo nãma I This passage seems to be the development of the mantra : prajãpatirviévakarmã ...mano ... e te. referred to above în connection with the importance of Prajäpati in the Šrauta institution of sacrifice. Moreover, in the Upanayana section of the Pãr-G9* sacrificial thread is significantly connected with Prajäpati, with the following hemistich : yajnopavïtam par amam pavitram prajãpateryaU sahajam purastãt ' 4 The Grhyasütras also refer to the concept of Tûsnïm- or Upãmáu- Prajäpati almost in the manner of tfratUa-texts. In the context of various types of marriage, the Kauéika-G 5 says : ãvrtah prãjãpatyãh . Side by side, the following sutra from the Upayamana rite may be referred to : manasã prajãpatih priyatãm iti brüyät | 6 In the Upa- nayana section of the ÁŠ-G1 moreover, there is an important passage, in this connection, as follows : "The student should put on a piece of wood silently. 1 Silence indeed is what belongs to Prajäpati. The student becomes belonging to Prajäpati ' - This is understood ( in the Šruti ) This is how Tùsnlm-Prajâpati occurs in ritual of the Grhyasütras . It is significant that in the foregoing passage authority of the áruti id produced to interpret the concept of silence connected with Prajäpati. This Šruti, in all probability, denotes the Brãhmanas , referred to above, in which the concept of Tûsnïm-Prajâpati occurs. As has been said above, the whole span of life, in connection with a sacrificer, is connected with Prajäpati in the Šrautasůtras. Similar connection is found also in the Grhyasütras.
