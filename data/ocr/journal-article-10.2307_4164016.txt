Texas A&amp;M University Press, College Station, Texas. 1996: xvi + 183 pp., 41 black-and-white drawings, one table. $29.95 (cloth).-More than a century ago C. Lloyd Morgan warned that "In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psy- chical facility if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychical state" (1896, Introduc- tion to Comparative Psychology, Scott, Lon- don. p. 53). This principle has come to be known as Morgan's Canon and, for the most part, it has been diligently observed by main- stream science. In this new book, The Minds of Birds, Alexander Skutch challenges this dominant paradigm, suggesting that in the zeal to avoid the stigma of anthropomorphism, stu- dents of animal behavior have gone too far. Rather, if we recognize that humans and our avian relatives share both physiological ho- mologies and life experiences, then it is par- simonious to attribute the specific actions of birds to human-like states and processes, such as consciousness, thought, and emotion. The book is organized into 16 topical chap- ters, each designed to demonstrate how the mental capabilities of birds have been grossly underestimated. Chapter 1 addresses the ex- tent to which birds recognize individuals of their own species, as well as individual human beings. Skutch introduces the topic by de- scribing the many contexts in which individ- ual recognition in birds is adaptive. He then illustrates the capabilities of birds with nu- merous examples from the literature, from sto- ries related to him by his colleagues, and from his personal experiences. These accounts are both informative and entertaining. For exam- ple, he describes several instances where cer- tain birds developed the habit of attacking par- ticular humans while ignoring others. The at- tacking birds generally were not fooled when the targeted human exchanged clothing with a tolerated conspecific companion, suggesting that these birds recognized either facial char- acteristics or some other anatomical or behav- ioral features of their "enemies." Chapter 2 deals with memory and expec- tation. Skutch presents numerous accounts of birds behaving contrary to the "widely held view that birds live only in the present, with- out conscious memories of the past or antici- pation of the future." Many of the accounts are anecdotal, such as the behavior of a pair of Crimson-backed Tanagers (Ramphocelus dimidiatus) toward a snake near their nest; they continued to act in an agitated manner for a considerable time after the snake had been removed. The examples of caching be- havior are more objective (e.g., corvids store up to 100,000 seeds with a recovery rate of 50-99%) and provide an impressive demon- stration of avian memory. Other chapters address social life, emotion, play, counting and timing, tool using, aesthet- ic sense, intelligence, freedom and altruism, and homing and migration. Another chapter is devoted to the apparent language skills of Alex, an African Gray Parrot (Psittacus eri-</page><page sequence="2">ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 583 thacus) who has been collaborating with Irene Pepperberg. A summary and concluding re- marks are presented in the final chapter. Although Skutch provides a wealth of in- formation, much of it not previously available in the published literature, some readers un- doubtedly will disagree with his interpreta- tions of the data presented. For example, in Chapter 5, he concludes that birds, especially immatures, may sing for amusement or enjoy- ment alone, but he does not explore the pos- sible selective advantages that a young male would gain by practicing and perfecting his species-specific vocalizations. Similarly, in the chapter on the emotions of birds, the tonal quality of calls elicited by the presence of an enemy are likened to those emitted by humans in similar circumstances, but the adaptive sig- nificance of wide-band dissonant alarm calls (vis-a-vis, high-frequency, narrow-band "seet" calls) is not discussed. Skutch employs a comfortable writing style that will be accessible to both the scientific and lay communities. The attractive line draw- ings by Dana Gardener illustrate the species being discussed and effectively complement the text. The book is well produced; this read- er found only a couple of typographical errors. The objectives of The Minds of Birds are clear: to persuade the reader to reconsider the ability of birds to think and experience emo- tions, and to convince that reader that a bird's psyche is far more similar to that of a human than is generally regarded. Skutch succeeds with the former objective; this book is cer- tainly thought-provoking. There will be a wide range of opinions in regard to the latter objective. For both reasons, I recommend this book.-JOHN A. SMALLWOOD.</page></plain_text>
