<plain_text><page sequence="1">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi* The problem of the rationality of magic' From Tylor and Frazer to Evans-Pritchard and Beattie anthropolo- gists have tried to explain why someone desiring crops follows up the planting of seeds with the enactment of a magical rite. The problem is why an actor sufficiently rational to know that seeds must be planted bothers with magic. One explanation which was advanced held that magic (or sorcery or witchcraft2) was as rational as planting. No one denies that both magic and planting may be performed irrationally, but it is difficult to use irrationality as an explanation of anything.3 Why, though, was magic problematic and not planting? Why was it taken for granted that planting is rational? Probably because it is relatively easy to explain; although the explanation is seldom stated. Two beliefs we take for granted suffice to explain the planting of seeds to obtain crops. First, the belief that planted seeds grow into crops; second, the belief that crops are highly desirable to those who plant seeds. The planting is thus explained by means of certain beliefs which show it to be conducive to desirable ends, i.e. rational. Can this same pattern of explanation be extended to magical acts? Can they be explained by conjecturing that those who perform them hold beliefs which would show such acts to be conducive to desirable ends? We propose, in this paper, to discuss the problems involved in the attempt, and whether a different kind of explanation is needed. It might be as well, before beginning, to make a distinction between rational action and rational belief.4 Let us attribute ration- ality to an action if there is a goal to which it is directed; let us attribute rationality to a belief if it satisfies some standard or criterion of rationality which has been adopted, such as that it is based on good evidence, or is beyond reasonable doubt, or is held open to criticism, etc. When we attribute rationality to a person we can mean either: he acts rationally, or he believes rationally, or both. Let us call the rationality that consists in a person acting rationally the * I. C. Jarvie B.sc.(Econ.) PH.D. Associate Professor of Philosophy, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Jarvie and Joseph Agassi weak sense or 'rationality'; and the rationality that consists in a per- son acting rationally on the basis of rationally held beliefs the strong sense of 'rationality'." Our thesis in this paper can now be formulated as: the ritual actions of magic are (or can be) rational only in the weak sense; this demarcates them from scientific actions which are (or can be) rational in the strong sense. II The well-known theory of magic of Sir James George Frazer will be our starting point because it was his parochial attitude to magic against which later anthropologists reacted strongly. His theory goes roughly like this.6 The magician performs the magical act because he (mistakenly) believes that that act will bring about the desired effect. Spells invoking things to happen, dances of enactment, are performed because they are thought to have the power of effecting the desired events. Magical acts are the result of false beliefs includ- ing the assumptions that: first, that by imitating the desired effect you can produce it, and second, that things which have once been in contact can influence each other when they are separated, just as if the contact still persisted (vol. XIII, p. 1). When the hunters enact the chase, or the warriors the victory, Frazer is saying, they do it because they believe this will evoke the desired end: they believe in homeopathic magic, so-called. When the magi- cian casts a spell, when, for instance, he employs finger-nail parings, he likewise does so in the belief that this brings about the desired end; he believes in contagious magic, so-called. In either case-the homeopathic case or the contagious case-the error is the same: the practitioners of magic are victims of a misplaced faith in the associa- tion of ideas. They believe, in Freudian language, in the omni- potence of thought. The thought-enactment of the victory, the thought-wish for illness to strike, are considered sufficient, with the right manipulations, to bring about these events. According to Frazer, this fundamental error of all magicians, their misplaced faith, is not an occasional lapse. On the contrary, their magic is an integral part of their whole cosmology; that is to say, magic is part of a theory of the universe according to which given kinds of causes or actions will produce desirable kinds of effects. Frazer's theory that magic is a cosmology, or world-view, explains two things. First, it explains the deep hold of magic on a believer and the wide significance he feels it has, and also the widespread nature of its appeal: it is a complete theory of the universe. Second, it explains how magic can be made more palatable to a Westerner: regarded as a cosmology, 56</page><page sequence="3">The problem of the rationality of magic magic becomes logically somewhat similar to the world-view of science. This may require some elucidation. It might help if we add to the comparison between science and magic, a third ingredient, namely religion. Religion seems less primitive than magic. But is it? Is this impression not a sign of our parochialism? In our society it is no longer controversial to regard religion as irrational; indeed, few people these days bother to claim that religion is rational in either the weak or the strong senses.7 We should then perhaps be less disturbed by regarding magic as irrational than by regarding it as rational. Yet it is not as simple as that. Benjamin Franklin attacked religion as irrational, but viewed magic as sheer savagery, as revolting and sub-human. And this feeling is not un- common today, among religious and non-religious, church-goers and non-church-goers. But magic qua cosmology, as pictured by Frazer, is strikingly differ- ent from any religion which pictures the universe as centred on a supreme (and possibly capricious) being; and so, strangely, on Frazer's view belief in magic is nearer to belief in science than to belief in religion and it is less irrational than the latter. Frazer's criterion for rational belief is approximation to the coherence and predictive power of natural science. Religion gives the universe free will; magic (like science) views it as a predictable and manipulable system. On the basis of this logical point, Frazer speculated (mention- ing that he had in part been anticipated by Hegel8) that human thought might have evolved from a magical stage, through a religious stage, to a scientific stage." It should be noticed that Frazer's logical distinction between religion and science is very different from widely accepted views of his time, and even of today, Primitive people, it was then supposed, believed in myths of an historical character, while rational people believed in scientific theories of a universal character. What differen- tiates the mythical from the scientific is, many people still hold to this day, that myths are stories, they explain by appealing to creations and origins, whereas scientific theories explain by appeal to universal laws.", 0' Another fashionable view is that religion is an abstract theology or metaphysics not in competition with science at all. The grounds for this position are often that while religious doctrine is putative history, it is not mythological and does not compete with science because it is not meant to be explanatory-whatever else it may be. Nowadays no one maintains that religion can or should provide answers to questions like why objects fall towards the centre of the earth, or when the next eclipse of the sun will occur. But magic and science both try to explain such things, and once upon a time religion did too. 57</page><page sequence="4">I. C. Jarvie and Josephl Agassi Frazer not only holds that religion has an explanatory intent but also that it is a very feeble and logically defective competitor to science. He sees magic, religion, and science as three competing systems, one of which is logically defective and one of which is factually defective. Whatever one may say as to the cogency of Frazer's theory, one must admit that it embodies a certain psychological insight into our parochial attitude towards magic. In spite of all the wars waged between science and religion in the West, in spite of a long and deeply entrenched tradition of hostility, the two now coexist cosily. Magic, however, is still the outcast.12 The truth is that, for the logical reason Frazer mentioned, science and religion are not intellectual competitors in the same way as science and magic are; religion is a non-starter. Religion, as practised in the West, is not practical but moral; whereas science and magic both claim immense pragmatic value. Hence the seeming irrationality of magic is so much more disturbing to a Westerner than the seeming irrationality of religion. A Westerner may invest much in religion, but unlike the primitive magician he expects no immediate practical returns from his rituals. Once we compare the magical rite not with Western religious rites, but with Western scientific rites, such as decontaminating water by using chlorine rather than holy water, or holding National Produc- tivity Conferences, we see the similarity. III In spite of its merit, there is no doubt but that the evolutionist speculation of Frazer may be viewed today with a cautious smile: unlike the nineteenth century, the twentieth is wary of sweeping historical schemes. Yet one might also view Frazer's speculation in its nineteenth-century context, and draw attention to some admirable features of it. Frazer was anti-religious," yet finally he placed religion a rung higher up the evolutionary ladder than magic-even though magical causation appealed to his nineteenth century 'scientific' mind more than revelation and anthropomorphism. His dislike of re- ligion was characteristic of the scientific humanism of the nineteenth century; his attempt to be less parochial about it, the very fact which is so laudable about him, also shows him to be a man of his time. How different is Frazer from contemporary social anthropologists, who are no longer bothered by religion at all, partly because of Frazer him- self. It is too early to assess Frazer's contribution to the fizzling out of the tradition of animosity between science and religion: but one can say that it is a feature of twentieth century social anthropologists that they dislike sociological parochialism and resent the European's ridi- cule of the aborigines' magic, yet they are not in the least em- 58</page><page sequence="5">The problem of the rationality of magic barrassed by religious parochialism and do not even notice their own scientific parochialism. They regard the ridicule of savages as lament- able, but the ridicule of Frazer as a pleasant pastime and com- mendable ritual. Certainly it is not difficult in retrospect to think of criticisms of Frazer's theory of magic. To begin with, his evolutionary scheme is very unconvincing. The problem it solves-'why do all human societies have either religion, or magic, or science?'-is a rather poor one. Magic, religion and science sometimes peacefully coexist in one and the same society. This makes it harder to show that either one has 'succeeded' or is a 'higher' stage than any other. It could be that they did evolve the one from the other, or there may have been any number of intervening stages, but on this question we can learn nothing from the known facts. Even were magic extinct in some society or other, it would still be a very difficult task to argue from that fact to the position that on the evolutionary scale magic is the most primitive of the three. Frazer managed to do so by a psycho- logical explanation of the three stages. He argued that 'magical think- ing' gave way to 'religious thinking' which in turn gave way to 'scientific thinking'. This is very unconvincing, too, because Frazer himself admits a closeness between magical thinking and scientific thinking. It is hard to conceive of one way of 'thinking' giving way to another and then reasserting itself, unless it is possible for them also to coexist. But then if they can coexist how can we know in which sequence they were invented? The answer is that magic, religion and science is a logical progression. Yet Frazer offers no reason for the assumption that the course of evolution followed a logical progres- sion; in the nineteenth century it was too easily taken for granted that history followed a pattern of logical development. It is an inter- esting hypothesis, but a rather doubtful one; even in the history of science, where succession is most likely to be in logical progression, it is very far from being the case that matters have progressed in a logical way. Leaving Frazer's evolutionary theory and concentrating on his views on magic for a moment, still further criticisms spring to mind. It is not clear that all magic is either homeopathic or contagious, as Frazer seems to have believed. And again, Frazer fails to show that belief in magic is any less defensible than belief in science. Since he regards these as incompatible ways of thinking he doesn't explicitly face the problem. Moreover to provide a theory explaining why belief in one is more defensible than belief in the other he would have to have a somewhat more sophisticated view of science or 'scientific thinking' than he appears to have. Admittedly, in one passage,4 he advocates a more sophisticated view of science as the task of offering explanatory hypotheses and improving them by comparing them 59</page><page sequence="6">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi with, and checking them against, the facts of experience. Yet more often he endorses a naive view of science as an accumulated mass of empirical observations from which theories have somehow to be squeezed. Since so much of Frazer's argument turns on comparison and contrast between magic, science and religion, all this has to be reassessed in the light of a more sophisticated view of science. Granted all these criticisms, then, and granted that the modern strictures about Frazer's work are at least partly justified, there still remains in Frazer's theory of magic an important element which has not thus far been criticized-it concerns the problem 'why do rational people perform magic?' As we recall, Frazer thinks people perform magic because they believe it will realize or help realize, or increase the likelihood of realization of, an end they are aiming at. This is at the very core of our present discussion since, if Frazer is right, then at least in one sense, and a rather central one at that. magic is very rational indeed and even more rational than religion iin precisely the logical sense presented by Frazer. Frazer's theory, as we can see, is on this point a bold and exciting one-and yet one which does not find favour among present-day social anthropologists. The commonest argument given against it is not so much a specific refutation but a general criticism of the entire assumption that people's actions can be explained by their beliefs. Whether explanation of human behaviour should, or may, be in terms of human ends and beliefs is a question which fills a whole literature, and one which we cannot enter here-nor need we. For one of the very few points which are fairly widely agreed upon in the field of philosophy and methodology of the social sciences is this, By definition, a rational action is one based on---amongst other factors -the actor's goals or aims, his present knowledge and beliefs.'5 Thus, to explain magical actions as rational actions presupposes dissent from the belief that belief does not explain action. If one insists that beliefs and ends do not count in the theory of explanation of human behaviour, one cannot formulate the problem of 'why do people we deem to be rational perform magical acts?' but at best 'why do some intellectuals say "magic is not rational" and show signs of displeasure when uttering these words?' To buttress our case we will discuss an influential current view which rejects the use of beliefs in explana- tions of magic as rational in either the weak or the strong sense, and yet which allows rational or goal-directed explanation in general. IV We have selected what might be called the Oxford Theory. It seems to stem from the work of Professor E. E. Evans-Pritchard, especially his Marrett Lecture and Nuer Religion,1 and it is also found in 6o</page><page sequence="7">The problem of the rationality of magic the works of members of his Institute such as G. Lienhardt,"' and J. H. M. Beattie.8" We shall draw most heavily on Beattie's Other Cultures precisely because it is a general expository work. In fact only in such introductory works does one find systematic attempts to set out and defend current theory. In two chapters of Other Cultures, 'Beliefs and Values' and 'Magic', the author expounds a theory he clearly regards as superior to Frazer's. Let us consider Beattie's view of rationality, and how he can impute it to magic without allow- ing it to be explained as conducive to the realization of certain ends. " Beattie's general theory of beliefs and values seeks to add an extra dimension to the usual view that these are factors which affect people's selection of means and ends. He begins by criticizing the Victorian idea that the thought of primitive people was childish and failed to distinguish between mental associations and causal connec- tions in the real world. With fieldwork it came to be seen that primi- tive belief-systems were far from childish. Evans-Pritchard showed in his book on the Azande, according to Beattie, that the beliefs of this highly intelligent people ... are ... not . . . a set of weird and irrational delusions about occult forces, but rather ... a mode of adjustment to the strains and frustrations of everyday life which, in the whole context of Zande culture, appears as eminently practical and sensible (p. 67). The modern social anthropologist does not proceed by framing these belief systems into formal propositions about reality and then discuss- ing how a reasonable man could ever have come to believe them- this was the Victorian intellectualist method-instead he attempts to understand the beliefs in the whole context of the culture of which they are a part. And now Beattie's theory of magic. In non-scientific cultures most thinking about the world is of a symbolic and literary character. The things symbolized are abstract notions like power, group solidarity, and familial or political authority: symbolism is essentially expressive; it is a way of saying something im- portant, something which it is impossible or impracticable to say directly (P. 71). And: We sometimes forget that the capacity for systematic analytic thinking about concepts is a product of several millenia of education and con- scious philosophizing (p. 7o). It is often difficult in practice to distinguish instrumental (i.e. goal-directed) behaviour from symbolic or expressive behaviour. It is instrumental to try to grow crops or kill one's enemy, but K 61</page><page sequence="8">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi expressive while doing so to chant spells or mutter over finger-nail parings. Instrumental behaviour must be understood in terms of the consequences it aims at and achieves; expressive behaviour in terms of the meanings, the ideas, it expresses (p. 72). Thus: Trobriand canoe magic stresses the importance of canoe building for the Trobrianders; blood pact ritual emphasises the need for mutual support between parties to it; the avoidance ritual asserts the need to maintain good relations between affinally linked groups (p. 210). All this is very ingenious, but does it explain why the actors perform the rites? Beattie admits that not everyone in the society is aware of the 'importance' of what they are symbolizing, although it is likely that in most societies at least some of the actors will be more or less aware of some of the social implications of their ritual institutions (p. 208). And besides, Beattie goes on, the symbolic actions themselves come to be thought to have a potency, an ability to bring about the event they are symbolizing. This contradicts Beattie's theory that magic is symbolic rather than instrumental, but he plays the contradiction down by asserting the 'essentially' symbolic character of magic. The social significance of seed sowing, canoe making, etc. is what magical chanting, dancing, etc. come to stress. First of all, we suggest that Beattie's theory shifts the problem from 'why do people we deem rational perform magical acts?' to 'what do magical acts mean?' We suggest this in order to explain the fact that he insists that perfectly intelligible meaning can be read into the symbolism of magic. Yet he is not interested in the latter question alone; he clearly hopes that the imputation of meaning to magic will defend primitive peoples against Frazer's charges of backwardness and irrationality. In other words, implicit in Beattie's discussion as well as in his very shift from the former problem of giving a rational explanation of magic to the latter problem of whether magic has a meaning-implicit in all this is the view that solving the latter amounts to solving the former. Here, at last, is the kernel of a new theory of rationality-if an act is not sociologically meaningless it is rational. We find a similar theory in Malinowski.20 Beattie's defence of the rationality of the magician, however, must fail because he is doing two things at once. To put it one way, a believer in the back- wardness and irrationality of primitive peoples could easily contend that belief in the potency of symbols was at least as backward and irrational as belief in an occult magical cosmology. To put it differ- ently, when we are faced with the equation of the rationality of an 62</page><page sequence="9">The problem of the rationality of magic act with its having social meaning, we must first examine this equa- tion against actions we all agree are rational and actions we all agree are not. Only if this equation makes sense of uncontroversially rational phenomena, can we use it as an arbiter of sorts concerning a controversial phenomenon like magic. There cannot, after all, be two theories of rationality, one applying only to instrumental actions, the other applying only to symbolic actions. This is where Beattie is trying to get the best of both worlds. He wants to say magic is not a case of a goal-directed rational action but it is rational on some other criterion. But then on that criterion goal-directed actions will have to be rational too. Thus Newton's theory could not be used to decide whether comets belonged to the solar system before it was successfully applied to bodies incontrovertibly belonging to that system. To take another example, when we say that there is no difference between living matter and dead matter and use the crystallizability of viruses as an example, our opponents merely shrug their shoulders and ask for less controversial examples of life than viruses. Consider Beattie's equation for a moment and see how odd it looks when applied to acts regularly observed in our society, such as cele- brating a wedding, standing overnight in a theatre queue, or acts common to all human societies, such as sowing rice and making canoes. These will be accepted as rational only if expressive of social meaning. But however expressive they are, can we explain queueing for Horowitz and sowing seeds without bringing in their goal? And if we can't, how far can we get with magic if we refuse to attribute a goal to it? Does Beattie's reading of social values into the symbolism of magic succeed in giving a rational explanation of why people perform magic (even though most of them do not understand what they are doing)? Is there a difference between acts whose social mean- ing is understood and ones whose social meaning is not? Strictly, if we take Beattie seriously, the answer is 'no' since he is prepared to see magic as rational even though the participants do not know what they are doing. And of course he nowhere denies rationality to actors who do know what they are doing. The trouble is, with these two standards of rationality it is difficult to imagine any act being irrational. Assume however there is a difference between understand- ing and not understanding the social meaning of one's actions. If so, then those who do not understand the social meaning of what they are doing must be doing it because of some other misunderstanding they have. Is not then the best hypothesis that they do not perform canoe magic because of the social importance of canoe building, they perform it because they think it will help them achieve some end, i.e. sailable canoes? Beattie's attempt to add an extra (symbolic) dimension to Frazer's 'instrumental' interpretation of magic confuses rather than clarifies 63</page><page sequence="10">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi the issue, especially when Beattie contradicts himself and allows an instrumental explanation of magic as based on a belief in the potency of symbols. Whether one says with Frazer that the magician believes his spell will invoke an occult force or power that will bring about the desired end; or whether one says with Beattie that magicians believe in the potency of symbols to bring about the desired end; does not make much difference. Both agree that magic is performed to bring about an end. But on the one hand Frazer sees magic as an occult cosmology being applied, whereas on the other hand Beattie's anti-Victorian intellectualism would make him object to the proce- dure of saying that belief in the potency of symbols is based on some different occult cosmology. To this one could say that either the belief in the potency of symbols is part of a larger cosmology or else it is ad hoc. If we have to choose between cosmology and ad hoc theory we choose cosmology. If we have to choose between two cosmologies the choice is more difficult, especially since Beattie gives us no clue as to the cosmology behind the belief in the potency of symbols. What other criticisms can be made of the symbolist view?21 Mainly, that even if it is true, how the symbolism is interpreted is entirely arbitrary. In order to make his thesis more convincing Beattie tries to say what is being symbolized, he interprets the symbols. He sug- gests that magic is a substitute-poor substitute may we say, or will this be pressing Beattie too hard on his parochialism?-for 'sys- tematic analytic thinking' about social life and values. Magic may be a substitute in the sense that it is thinking, even 'systematic and analytic' to use Beattie's words, but being not fully articulated it is not sufficiently systematic and analytic. Alternatively, magic may be a substitute in that it is systematically an unanalytic method of destroying all doubts and desire for 'analytic' thinking by intoning impressive mumbo-jumbo. Beattie seems to hold to the second when he says that magical thinking is assertion or affirmation of social values. What is curious is that he regards this as an alternative way of thinking, not as a precursor; or, at least, so his thesis that magic is perfectly reasonable suggests. Yet on the other hand his mention of millennia of reflection suggests 'systematic and analytic' thinking is something better. Again there appears to be some contradiction in his position. At best, then, Beattie's interpretation of the symbolic thinking of the magician simply involves reading a statement into an act. This move is highly problematic. In the West we are familiar with acts-as- statements. For example flag-semaphore, or the conventions of mime and ballet. The latter are a little vague, the former very precise. Both are quite arbitrary conventions. But the decisive point is that their meaning is intentional: those performing the acts know and need to know what they are doing. A highly technically accomplished dancer 64</page><page sequence="11">The problem of the rationality of magic unaware of the meaning of what he or she is doing can hardly act the dance in an appropriate way. Just as the uninitiated spectator can hardly react in an appropriate way. There are perhaps a few univer- sals: smiles, tears, etc., but these cannot be grasped out of context. A smile may say 'I am happy' or it may mean 'I am suffering but putting a brave face on it', or it may be a hypocritical smile, etc. It cannot thus be 'read' without the whole context of the conventions. And all this applies to consciously intended meanings. How much more problematic is the reading of meaning into actions which are not intentionally meaningful? Of course, it could be said that it is enough that some people know the meaning of what they are doing, they could teach or at least guide the rest. But this does not escape the problem. When we see people performing actions and we ask why and are answered that they are symbolizing something but they don't know it, we are not being told why they are performing the actions they are performing. We are being told how the teachers of the actions they are performing interpret the actions they teach. Perhaps the performers see what they are doing in quite a different light. In a similar way it is a commonplace of criticism of the arts to say that the author's intentions are not necessarily definitive; sometimes one even finds art being judged by the richness of meanings that can be read into it. Perhaps this point cuts both ways: on the one hand it strengthens the view that imputations of meaning are arbitrary; but it could also be used to separate the 'objective' meaning from the intentional meaning. The intentional meaning is irrelevant to the objective meaning. However, this argument again evades the problem of the explanation of the actions in question. Only the intentional meaning is relevant to why the artist created the work he did. In parallel, only the intentional meaning is relevant to the explanation of why the people are acting as they are. It is an entertaining game to read meanings into people's actions, just as it is to read symbolism into works of art. Personally we find Freudian analyses of the symbolism of magic somewhat more enter- taining than Beattie's crypto-Durkheimian assertions of its convey- ing something about social value. But at least we recognize it all as arbitrary and therefore entirely without power to give a convincing explanation of the behaviour concerned. On the basis of his extra dimension, of the social message he reads into every act of magic, Beattie objects to the parallel Frazer draws between science and magic. He strongly contrasts symbolic or magical thinking with scientific thinking. This may sound strange because Frazer did this too with his parochial view that magical thinking was an earlier stage than scientific thinking. But here, for a change, Beattie is consistent. Viewing magic intellectually leads to seeing it 65</page><page sequence="12">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi as inferior; viewing it as art of sorts, like a Catholic procession or a ballet performance or poetry, hardly allows of comparison with science, but it certainly prevents imputations of inferiority.22 It is perhaps a pity the symbolist reading of magic does not explain why people do it. Take Lienhardt's example (1961) of Dinka tying a knot in the grass when coming home late. This is supposed to express a wish that the women will delay the dinner. But, not accepting that this ritual action is sufficient actually to delay the dinner, the Dinka hurries home as well. Now either: the knotted grass concentrates attention, as Lienhardt seems to say, in which case it is no more magical than our mnemonic of tying a knot in a handkerchief; or, it is believed to be efficacious somehow. But then why does not the Dinka saunter back, confident of the power of ritual? The answer is the same as when asking why the farmer plants as well as chants, chases birds away after planting, etc. The two actions are part of one technique which we separate but which the actors do not. Evans-Pritchard, at least, is a little clearer on all this. His discussion of symbolism is concerned with what Nuer mean when they say that birds are twins, that a sacrificial cucumber is an ox, of a crocodile that it is spirit, etc. His answer is simple enough, these are poetic modes of speech, partly theological (spirit is in the sky, birds are in the sky, twins are spirits and therefore twins are birds), partly sym- bolic (the cucumber stands-in for the ox), partly associationist (croco- diles lay eggs, so do birds, birds are spirit, etc.). But of course Nuer act because they believe all these things. Evans-Pritchard does not say this here, a propos of Nuer religion, which is strange, and perhaps indicative of some hesitation; after all, in his book on the Azande he stresses that customers test their magicians and their oracles as severely as they can before submitting to them. Would he now say that they test them though they view them purely symbolically? If not, then the symbolism plays at most a secondary role according to his own views. And so with the Nuer too: They have certain doctrines about spirit that they believe to be true. As Lienhardt says (1956): If there were no guarantee, for example, that a diviner was permitted an insight into the true grounds of an illness, there would be no means of dealing with that illness.... Only if these 'poetic' ideas are believed will they be acted on, and only if they are being acted on do they explain what people are doing. Beattie, Lienhardt and Evans-Pritchard all confuse the strong and weak senses of rationality. They want to rebut the view that belief in magic and religion is irrational because not strongly rational, and in so doing they undermine the attribution of even weak rationality to religion. If we, the authors of this paper, maintain that belief in magic and religion is not rational we would only do so on the basis 66</page><page sequence="13">The problem of the rationality of magic of a highly sophisticated philosophical argument23 and we would include the Great Religions. But we still maintain that it is a mini- mum requirement of explanation that magical acts be explained as rational in the weak sense. It may indeed be 'intellectualist' to explain people's actions by theories which assert that they know what they are doing and act on that knowledge, but it may also be successful to some degree. The question is, whether any other way of explaining human actions is to be found.24 Moreover, Beattie's discussion of the symbolic or poetic way of thinking as contrasted with 'systematic analytic thinking' accepts implicitly one of the weakest points in Frazer's theory-the view that magic, religion and science are different because different 'ways of thinking' underlie them. Frazer himself confuses his logical distinction between the three (in terms of the manner in which they explain the universe), with a psychological hypothesis about how they were arrived at. But how they were arrived at is a different problem. To explain the behaviour concerned it is sufficient to reconstruct beliefs in terms of which the problematic action makes sense. So, to avoid the psychological parochialism of Frazer's view, which might be formulated as-'scientific thinking is better than erroneous religious thinking which is better than associationist magical think- ing'-Beattie gives us the psychological relativism25 of 'all humans do some irrational (poetic, symbolic) thinking'. More schematically, Beattie replaces Frazer's 'some men's thinking is rational, other men's is not', with 'all men sometimes think irrationally (i.e. symbolically)'. While this at first looks like progress away from parochialism, it is no progress even in that respect: who can say whether it is less parochial to allow that magic is an inferior substitute for rational thought, or to follow Frazer who has managed to show it to be rational though erroneous?26 Although Beattie's is quite a sophisticated way to avoid parochialism by viewing magic as a lapse of rational people it is none- theless very naive in another way. Beattie, like Frazer, rejects magic, of course, as erroneous; unlike Frazer, however, he cannot view error as rational, but at best as a rationality surrogate. This is the paro- chialism of the twentieth century in its worst manifestation: science is always right, science is rational, ergo rationality leads to the avoid- ance of error."' This folly is only partly mitigated by 'all people make some mistakes', which follows from 'all people are sometimes irrational'. Embedded here is the incredible idea that there exists something like a rational or scientific thought process which leads to the discovery of truth and especially technology.28 Fundamentally it is Frazer's accusation that primitive peoples' magic is in error that Beattie is rejecting. Error for Beattie needs to be explained, especially if it is relinquished slowly; is this because he associates error with stupidity, irrationality, backwardness?"29 Perhaps this association 67</page><page sequence="14">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi explains why Beattie accepts Frazer's psychological explanation of the difference between magic and science as a difference between the quality of thought. Why else should Beattie go to great lengths to show that primitive peoples are capable of technical-practical thought other than to buttress his claim that they cannot be relegated to an inferior stage? When we examine the content of Beattie's notion of 'rational or scientific thinking' we find he has compounded his error by also swallowing whole Frazer's naive view of science as accumul- ated empirical experience from which unquestionably true laws are squeezed by induction.30 Clearly magic, or symbolic thinking, how- ever it proceeds, does not proceed like inductive or scientific thinking. Here Beattie scores an easy point against Frazer who, as we remem- ber, compares magic with science. We need not labour the obvious point that Frazer does not compare magic and science on all points but only on the point of universality; rather, let us continue with Beattie's insight into the contrast between magic and scientific thought. Beattie intimates that in so far as primitive peoples know how and where and when to plant seeds, know how and which trees to carve, know how and where and when to fish, etc., they display a practical mastery of their physical environment similar to that which we base on modern science. They have built this up by steady accumulation of empirical experience. This clinches his point that primitive people are not irrationally incapable of scientific thinking, and that all people use both empirical accumulation and symbolic representation in their thinking. Assume instead a rather more sophisticated view of science as a highly articulated system of explanatory theories which may be tested against the facts. Assume further, that primitive technology is not science in this sense. Agree, still further, with Beattie, that primitive technology is not magic. What, then, is to be made of primitive tech- nology? The question is not only interesting in itself; Beattie would be justified in pressing it on Frazerians like ourselves. For Frazer at times expresses just such a sophisticated view of science, and he surely knew of primitive technology and of the difference between primitive technology and magic. If a magician is asked why he both plants and chants he will no doubt say that it is the proper procedure to produce crops. If he is asked what would happen if he did not chant he would no doubt answer that if he did not chant the seeds would not grow. If one argued that Westerners grow crops but never chant he would have three alternatives: puzzlement at our success, crowing over our failures, or, more likely, attribution of magic to our ploughing and fertilizer-scattering rituals. This is all commonplace since we know that magic, being a doctrine about the occult, is compatible with all empirical experience and thus cannot be directly refuted.3' This is an 68</page><page sequence="15">The problem of the rationality of magic extremely important and puzzling point. It raises the problem of how individuals or communities ever do break out of the magical world- view. Yet those who hold that world-view are surely not in any diffi- culty with their primitive technology. We believe their explanations of their technology to be false and ours to be true. But explanations are one thing and practical utility is quite another. False technology and even falsly justified true technology can nevertheless work. So the problem of what to make of primitive technology vanishes: primitive people have some technology, that is all. Nothing can be concluded from this about their capacity for science or their freedom from superstition. It is not a question of how people we deem to be rational can perform magical acts, but rather a question of how primitive technology fits into the magical world-view. V Examination and discussion of Beattie, then, has forced us to realize, at least, that our original formulation, 'Why do people we deem to be rational perform magical acts?', is question-begging and parochial. It assumes entities, entirely rational persons (Beattie denies their existence), performing what seem at first sight irrational actions, magic (Frazer shows that on deeper examination the first sight impression disappears). How can we formulate the problem so that we neither bifurcate humanity or persons? The question can arise in other fields. Before Jenner, vaccination against smallpox was com- bined with bleeding, and took five days. Now the vaccination was, of course, rational in the strong sense; can the bleeding be explained as rational in the strong sense? This question improperly separates bleeding and vaccination which, before Jenner, were subsumed under some general theory that explained them as effective in combination (or, perhaps methodologically worse, there may have been two theories of how to prevent smallpox, one by bleeding the other by vaccination, and the purely ad hoc hypothesis that two cures is better than one was employed). But in order to explain why doctors did both one must treat the two as one-as they did-and reconstruct their behaviour from that. Similarly, primitive societies have both technology and magic and we should try to explain their behaviour with hypotheses that do not make a separation they do not make. This is very difficult, since we have to overcome our own built-in categories. The problem might become something more like 'is primitive society rational in the weak sense?', i.e. can the actions of people in primitive societies be rationally explained by means of their aims, beliefs and knowledge of their circumstances? There is no doubt about the answer. If we press the point, though, and ask whether primitive people adopt a rational or critical attitude to their 69</page><page sequence="16">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi beliefs and explanations, the issue becomes a little more sensitive. The answer depends upon one's criterion of rationality; and then it becomes a factual question: does or does not such and such a society possess, e.g. the tradition of adopting a critical attitude towards beliefs, values, explanations? This is a question of sociological fact: the presence or absence of a tradition. It reflects in no way upon the intelligence, stupidity, human dignity, or mental capacities of the peoples of the societies in question. VI In conclusion, we should remark that our view of magic as cosmology is heavily influenced by Evans-Pritchard. He says the primitive's belief in magic and sorcery plays much the same role as our doctrines of luck and fate.32 The primitive believes seeds would not grow if he did not chant, if they do not grow anyway he must have chanted wrongly. Good luck will come to him if he does things properly, bad luck is the result of either his own incompetence as a magician, or of malevolent magic performed against him by his enemies. The strength of the magical world-view is that it is a complete world-view, one that explains anything and everything in terms of magic, failed magic, or magical conspiracies. It combines very smoothly with even a sophisticated technology because it explains its success.33 What are the consequences of this view of Evans-Pritchard's? First, that in Frazer's sense magic is perfectly compatible with rationally explicable behaviour-it is a world-view, a cosmology, and one with great power to grip. Second, that in Beattie's sense it is a substitute for systematic and analytic thinking, it does answer all those difficult questions some of which Western science answers, some of which are ultimate and for which Western science offers no explanation. This result has come about because Beattie has confused rationality in the sense of rational action, with rationality in the sense of rational belief. This is why he criticizes Frazer's 'intellectualism' when Frazer is talking about rational action and not about the way primitives think, and this is why he is caught in a net, in an inconsistency between the non-parochialism of his relativism (all societies have technology which shows they are rational), and the super-parochialism of his assumption that science (equals no error, equals usable tech- nology) is the mark of rationality. The attempt to avoid parochialism is surely laudable; to that end we must first give up scientific parochialism and then view the world as much as possible from the viewpoint of the primitive man, who has no reason to suspect that magic is not as effective as twentieth-century Western technology. We suggest that primitive people do not sow seeds and then perform irrational magic ritual, but that they grow crops in a very inefficient 70</page><page sequence="17">The problem of the rationality of magic way, having no tractors and not knowing that ritual or no ritual makes no difference. Belief in magic is no better than belief in leeches or in phlogiston. We must assume that believers in either believe it to be true."' The problem is not, then, 'how on earth can they believe in magic?'; it is rather 'can people with inefficient magical beliefs come to be critical of them, under what conditions and to what extent?' To us this seems the really urgent sociological problem posed by magic. Notes i. The first author read a draft of this paper to a colloquium at the Uni- versity of Minnesota, organized by the Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science, and to the staff seminar in philosophy at York University, Toron- to, in December 1965. Grateful ack- nowledgement is made to the discus- sants on those occasions, and to H. J. Lethbridge and W. W. Bartley III for critical comments. 2. NWe follow Firth in regarding magic, sorcery and witchcraft as points on a continuous spectrum. See R. Firth, Human Types, London, 1957, p. 156. At p. 166 ff. Firth suggests the spectrum also includes religion. See also note 29 below. 3. Cf. I. C. Jarvie, The Revolution in Anthropology, London, 1964, p. 218. 4. This raises the problem of dis- tinguishing action from belief, and of deciding whether rational belief is just a special case of rational action. How- ever, the issue need not be entered here since the argument is not affected by it. See the discussion and references in J. Agassi, 'The Role of Corroboration in Popper's Methodology', Australa- sian J. Phil., vol. 39 (1961), pp. 82-91. 5. The rationality that consists in holding certain beliefs rationally but not basing any actions on them is some- thing of a lame duck. 6. The locus classicus is of course his monumental The Golden Bough, 3rd edn., London, 1936, in 12 volumes plus The Aftermath. The excellent index makes detailed references redundant. 7. We would hold it to be rational in the weak sense: the goal of religious actions is something like the worship of God, or the exorcism of sin, or the survival of life after death. We would however maintain that religion defies most criteria of rational belief and thus is not rational in the strong sense. As an example of the uncontroversial character of the view that religion is irrational take the much-admired re- cent paper by Robin Horton, a very sophisticated social anthropologist. At pages 222-3 we find him arguing that religion will never be killed off by science because ultimately religion is not rational (in either sense?) and can only be judged by faith, not reason. See 'A Definition of Religion and Its Uses', J. Roy. Anth. Inst., vol. 9o, pp. 201-26. 8. Frazer, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 423 ff., Appendix 'Hegel on Magic and Re- ligion'. 9. The evolution might be recon- structed as follows. At first primitive man superstitiously regarded the world as being dominated by occult forces, and his magic was an attempt to manipulate them; then disappointment at their capriciousness forced a retreat into anthropomorphism, i.e. a belief which explained the capriciousness as caused by gods and goddesses who had to be propitiated; then, finally, a 71</page><page sequence="18">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi rejection of anthropormorphism and a return to a stable conception of the universe, but this time without the superstitions or the occult and instead the newly refined and tested ideas of empirical science. lo. Further, it is thought that myths are fantasies, with no relation to facts, while scientific theories are firmly grounded in fact. For an exciting dis- cussion and criticism of this view see P. K. Feverabend, Knowledge Without Foundations, Oberlin, 1961, esp. ?? 7 et seq. 11. This view of what constitutes the difference between myths and scientific theories is not new. We find St. Augustine arguing against its corol- lary that Christianity is primitive; and we find St. Thomas quoting this theory and its corollary before trying to refute it. His refutation is that since science must be based on revelation the Christian doctrine is scientific par ex- cellence, and he acknowledges this ar- gument to St. Augustine. (See Summa Theologica, Part I, Question 1, 'The Nature and Extent of Sacred Doctrine' (in ten articles): second article 'Whe- ther Sacred Doctrine is a Science', Objection 2, et seq.) Nowadays only a very few naive Catholic teachers and fewer very sophisticated philosophers (notably Polanyi, see The Logic of Liberty, Chicago, 1951, esp. pp. 23 ff.) advocate views which in any way re- semble the ideas of St. Augustine and St. Thomas. 12. Or the unrecognized. Instead of casting spells after planting seeds we hold conferences of agriculturists both before and after. Do these not have a strong magical component? 13. His Golden Bough is obviously a conscious attempt to discredit religion -especially Christianity-by tracing its line of descent to primitive super- stition. Dr. E. R. Leach has disputed this in his 'Frazer and Malinowski', Encounter, vol. 15 (Nov. 1965), pp. 24- 36. However, he disputes it mainly on the grounds that Frazer was circum- spect in his direct comments on Christ- ianity. Yet Frazer's circumspection can hardly be interpreted as attempting to conceal his secret religiosity. See Jarvie's rebuttal 'Academic Fashions and Grandfather Killing-In Defense of Frazer', Encounter, vol. 26 (April 1966), PP. 53-5- 14. This redeeming passage is to be found in the summing-up; we find there a most striking and sophisticated picture of science: 'We must remember that at bottom . . . the laws of nature are merely hypotheses to explain that ever-shifting phantasmagoria of thought which we dignify with the high-sounding names of the world and the universe . . . and as science has supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be itself superseded by some more perfect hypothesis . . . of which we in this generation can form no idea.' (The Golden Bough, op. cit., vol. XI, p. 306.) 15. For a very clear setting-out of this matter see C. G. Hempel, 'Rational Action', Proc. and Addresses Amer. Phil. Assn., vol. 35, PP. 5-23- 16. Evans-Pritchard's Marrett Lec- ture 'Social Anthropology Past and Present' is reprinted in his Essays in Social Anthropology, London, 1964. Apart from the works mentioned below, the Oxford Theory is also to be found in D. F. Pocock's Social An- thropology, London, 1961, and G. ILienhardt's Divinity and Experience: Religion Among the Dinka, Oxford, 1961. 17. See his 'Religion', chapter XIV inl Man, Culture and Society, edited by H. L. Schapiro, New York, 1956; and Social Anthropology, London, 1964. 18. Other Cultures, London, 1964. i9. After this paper was written, Dr. Beattie's Malinowski Memorial Lec- ture ('Ritual and Social Change', Man- J.R.A.I, vol. 1 (1966), pp. 60-74) came into our hands. He there re-argues rather than expands and develops his Other Cultures ideas (indeed he refers to the fuller treatment in the latter). Thus our criticisms apply pari passu. He ends with the assertion that cargo cults seem more amenable to explana- tion as proliferations of symbolic repre- 72</page><page sequence="19">The problem of the rationality of magic sentations than as the formulating and testing of hypotheses to explain events. As against Beattie's assertion, see the latest monograph on cargo cults, Road Belong Cargo, Manchester, 1965, and Jarvie's paper on it 'On the Explana- tion of Cargo Cults', European J. Soc., forthcoming. 20. Malinowski's theory was that magic draws its rationality from the ordered social life of which it was a functioning part. He also argued that magic provided a psychological re- assurance, a technique of coping with the unknown and unpredictable. We have not discussed these ideas in the text, partly because of their psycho- logical component, and partly because an excellent discussion of them already exists (see S. F. Nadel, 'Malinowski on Magic and Religion' in R. Firth (ed., Man and Culture, London, 1957, pp. 189-208). Beattie's Malinowski Mem- orial Lecture, op. cit., also has an in- teresting presentation of Malinowski's views. 21. For incisive criticisms of the sym- bolist view by an anthropologist see R. Firth, Essays in Social Organization and Values, London, 1964, pp. 235-7. 22. This comparison with art is stressed heavily in the Malinowski Memorial Lecture, op. cit. 23. See R. Robinson, An Atheist's Values, London, 1964, p. 118 ff. 24. For some discussion of this see The Revolution in Anthropology, op. cit., pp. 216 ff. 25. Although there would seem to be some contradiction between his rela- tivism and his view that primitive peoples are incapable of systematic analytic thinking. 26. Yet see the puzzling remark of Lienhardt, 'To show a religion to be reasonable, and to suggest that it is the result of reasoning from faulty pre- misses, as Tylor and Frazer did, are not the same thing', in 'Religion', op. cit., P. 315- 27. For a discussion of error see J. Agassi, Towards An Historiography of Science, History and Theory, Beiheft 2, 1963, PP- 54 fif. 28. C. L6vi-Strauss calls it 'theoreti- cal thinking of the highest order' in his Huxley Memorial Lecture, 'The Future of Kinship Studies', Proc. Roy. Anth. Inst. (1965), p. 15. The point arises in the course of his discussion of how involved rules of marriage preference came to be adopted. He maintains that they are 'true discoveries' by 'a small minority of learned individuals'. He thinks it is 'crude naturalist philos- ophy' to believe these systems or scientific knowledge in general could be 'the blind product of a series of trials and errors'. 29. Lienhardt stresses the point that brilliant minds have believed in magic. He presumably regards this as a refuta- tion of the theory that magic is a pro- duct of stupid or irrational minds- because, of course, brilliant minds could not embrace error. But one could just as well say it shows that even clever people make mistakes. See his Social Anthropology, op. cit., p. 149. A much better defence of primitive peoples against charges of 'stupidity and credulity' is to be found in R. Firth's admirable Human Types, op. cit. In chapter VI Firth points out that Poly- nesian canoe-building is technically admirable as well as dedicated to the gods. Between the poles of magic- irrational because based on false pre- misses-and science-rational par ex- cellence-is a grading where the two phenomena coexist. (Indeed a magical attitude towards science is not un- known.) Both can be closely interwoven into practical affairs, economic wants and the critical periods of human life. On page 161 Firth shows how it re- mains rational for people to go on believing in failed magic. Close exam- ination, however, reveals that failure is explained by ad hoc auxilliary hypo- theses which make the magic a rein- forced, uncriticisable system. Whether one can entirely clear the natives of the charge of 'stupidity and credulity' as Firth thinks one can, depends on one's criterion of rationality. (Cp. Feyera- bend, op. cit., pp. 38-43.) If one does convict the natives of 'stupidity and 73</page><page sequence="20">I. C. Jarvie and Joseph Agassi credulity' one also convicts a great many Westerners, including some religious believers and even some scien- tifists, Cp. K. R. Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery, London, 1959, PP. 78-84. 30. Indeed generally Beattie's at- tempt in the Malinowski Memorial Lecture to pin down an 'essential' difference between science and expres- sive actions founders on his misconcep- tions about science. Most instances of essentially expressive magical be- haviour can be matched by examples of expressive scientific behaviour. Beattie, to use his own words, has a 'too exclusive commitment to an instrumentally-oriented' view of sci- ence (pp. cit. p. 68). 31. Cf. J. W. N. Watkins, 'Between Analytic and Empirical', Philosophy vol. 32 (1957), PP. 1-2o; 'Confirmable and Influential Metaphysics', Mind, vol. 67 (1958), pp. 334-65; 'The Haunted Universe', The Listener, vol. 57 (1957), pp. 837-8 and 883 and 886; and J.

It is instructive to compare this with the West where it becomes increas- ingly difficult for us to accept a world view with no rough edges, one that explains everything. Our own world views no longer do. We allow large roles of coincidence, accident, luck and fate. All of these categories are vague and introduced ad hoc; our world-view does not try to explain everything, if it did it would be irrefutable and we have ceased to regard irrefutability as a desirable quality. The unique and disconcerting thing about the western scientific world-view is that it is pro- gressive: it is more interested in the question than the answer; it puts a premium on overthrowing and improv- ing previous answers by means of severe criticisms. Among these severe criti- cisms is that of irrefutability: immunity to all possible experience. 34. Cp. W. R. G.
