<plain_text><page sequence="1">JULIA A. HENDON Harvard University Status and Power in Classic Maya Society: An Archeological Study This article uses archeological data to examine how social relations allocate economic and political power in ancient complex societies. Based on recent excavations in the Copan Valley, Honduras, the socioeconomic organization of the basic residential group is reconstructed and the existence of a pervasive social hierarchy demonstrated. I argue that during the Late and Terminal Classic periods, the Maya were organized into a series of internally ranked and externally stratified status lineages (Goldman 1970) that structured social, economic, and political relationships. T HIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ROLE OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE as a shaper of economic and political systems in ancient complex societies using archeological data from the Lowland Maya area of Mesoamerica. Rather than consider social structure only as a normative or ideal set of constructs, I approach it from the perspective of a system defined by actual human behavior (Wolf 1990). I will focus on "those social relations which seem to be of critical importance for the behaviour of members of the society, so that if such relations were not in operation, the society could not be said to exist in that form" (Firth 1963:31). Cross-cultural studies have shown that certain aspects of the relations pro- duced by this behavior may be fossilized in architecture, spatial patterns, mortuary cus- toms, and style (Hendon 1991; Tainter 1978). Fundamental to my interest in the archeological manifestations of social structure is a concern with the ways that a particular system of organization orders and regulates the allocation of power and the control of human energy (Wolf 1990). Adams (1975:10) de- fines power as "that aspect of social relations that marks the relative equality of the actors or operating units; it is derived from the relative control by each actor or unit over ele- ments of the environment of concern to the participants." Power derives first from energy and second from the ability to direct that energy; in other words, on the control of re- sources and the productive means to exploit and distribute these resources. It is thus socially defined power, since the particular elements of the environment considered wor- thy of control will be to a large extent culturally determined (Adams 1975). The role of monumental architecture, exotic materials, and stylistic elaboration as embodiments of energy and resource control and thus of power is well demonstrated (Trigger 1990). Integral to a consideration of the distribution and form of power is a concern with social rank and stratification. As Adams (1975:165-173, 246-247) has argued, ranking is uni- versal, not unique to humans, and cannot be restricted to a particular stage of human social evolution. It cannot be correlated with a specific form of political organization nor easily limited to one level of some ideal typology (see also Trigger 1984). From this van- tage point, a ranking system orders a group of people within a particular socially defined set, acting at the same time as a coordinating device and a setter of priorities. Stratifica- tion is a kind of macro-ranking that operates on these sets, ranking them with respect to one another. "[T]he sets are themselves distinguished by the fact that the members of JULIA A.

In many precapitalist, nonindustrialized societies, ranking and stratification are based on "the concept of the inherent superiority of the line of descent" (Goldman 1970:xvi), a concept both stable and flexible. Kinship and descent thus become the mechanisms by which individuals are ranked within their social group and such groups are stratified across the society as a whole. Such ranking creates a series of "nested" inequalities both within a particular group and vis-a-vis other groups. The elite produced by this "system of social status" (Goldman 1970:4) are linked, on the one hand, by shared rank and as- sociated privilege to one another and, on the other hand, to the commoner segment of their own social group. Although grounded in control of material resources, the existence and form of the status system are legitimated by ideology that ascribes superior worth, power, and ability to the elite (Adams 1975:234-239; Godelier 1978; Goldman 1970:16). Epigraphic evidence clearly shows the importance of genealogy and ideology in the creation, definition, and maintenance of a social status system among the pre-Hispanic Lowland Maya (Demarest 1989; Schele 1991; Tate 1986). The hieroglyphic inscriptions, however, attest primarily to the political aspects of this stratification and focus mainly on the ruling line (Carlson 1980). We must turn to other facets of the archeological record, such as settlement patterns, architecture, material culture, and burials, to address effec- tively the social and economic relations of the system as a whole. In this article, I focus on the evidence available for the activities, social organization, and economic role of the rest of the elite. By this phrase, I designate a group of people of high status who never- theless are not part of the ruler's immediate family and are, at least in ideal terms, his political subordinates. Members of this group appear occasionally in inscriptions that record their titles, genealogy, and certain stereotyped activities (e.g., Riese 1989; Schele 1991; Tate 1986). The archeological manifestation of this group can be clearly seen in the zoned settlement pattern common to many Maya sites. In this pattern, size and monu- mentality-defined by Trigger (1990:119) as "scale and elaboration exceed[ing] the re- quirements of any practical functions"-of residences decrease with distance from the civic-ceremonial center. This pattern typically creates three zones: (1) the center itself with the most elaborate residences and other monumental construction; (2) an adjacent area of large, well-built, and often decorated residences; and (3) an outer zone of smaller and more dispersed residences (e.g., Fash 1983b; Kurjack 1974; Willey and Leventhal 1979). The amount of energy invested in these structures (Abrams 1989; Gonlin 1985) and the associated artifacts provide evidence of differential control of and access to ma- terial resources, the foundation of power. At the same time, the design, decoration, and construction of the residences provide a visual statement of this power (Hendon 1991). Drawing on data from the Late to Terminal Classic periods in the Copan Valley, Hon- duras (ca. A.D. 650-1000), I examine residential sites in one such elite inner zone. My analysis has two parts. I first discuss the kinds of activities, their spatial distribution, and their association with types of buildings in order to look at what the residents of these sites did and where they did it. These patterns allow me to draw certain conclusions about consumption, production, and ritual behavior of direct relevance to the study of social relations. This part of the paper speaks directly to the recent archeological interest in the household through its charting of the behavior of co-residential groups (e.g., Mac- Eachern, Archer, and Garvin 1989; Wilk and Ashmore 1988). The household, however, is not the primary focus of my analysis; rather, I use the evidence for shared activities as a way to examine the social relations of the occupants of these sites. The second part of my analysis concentrates on the evidence for differences in status among the residents of the area. Such differences manifest themselves in three aspects of the archeological record: (1) architectural elaboration; (2) the presence of scarce, exotic, and culturally valued materials; and (3) the treatment of the dead. By combining these patterns with other sources on the Maya and more general analogies, I propose a model</page><page sequence="3">896 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 of Maya social organization that considers the composition of the major social groups, their residential patterns, and their interrelationships. Many previous discussions of Maya social structure have focused on economics, ar- guing that differences in status should result from occupational specialization or, more broadly, from the control of craft production and distribution (e.g., Adams 1970; Kurjack 1974; McAnany 1989). However, the evidence for craft specialization among the Maya suggests to me that it augmented rather than created elite power (see Aldenderfer, Kim- ball, and Sievert 1989; Mallory 1984). As I will show, this is certainly the case for the Copan Valley, where neither control of raw materials nor of specialized production cre- ated or sustained the elite in the inner zone. The one clearly established example of large- scale specialized production for regional exchange in the Maya Lowlands during the Late Classic period occurs at the site of Colha in Belize, a small center in a peripheral location (Shafer and Hester 1983). Patronage of craft specialists or control over the distribution of their products no doubt gave the elite additional ways to reinforce their high status through personal display or gift giving but did not serve as the primary basis of rank or power. Such power was based on the control of basic productive resources-land and labor-and was structured through descent and kinship. This structure, underwritten by a validating ideology that gave certain individuals and groups higher status by virtue of descent, created a series of ranked coordinate groups (Adams 1975:210) that were rela- tively autonomous economically even while centralized politically under the polity's rul- ing lineage (see Demarest 1989; Sanders 1989; cf. Carrasco 1976; Goldman 1970; Kan 1989). Much discussion of ancient Maya social, political, and economic organization has taken place within the context of settlement pattern studies that rely more on surface survey and limited excavation than on large-scale excavations. Thus, visible architectural features and their spatial relations have been emphasized at the expense of artifacts and their associations. Such work also privileges the discussion of administrative hierarchies or regional economic networks (e.g., Ashmore 1981). My own data derive from four years of excavation carried out by the Proyecto Arqueol6gico Copin Fase II (PAC II) under the direction of William T. Sanders. Working in the eastern part of the inner zone of occupation within one kilometer of the civic-ceremonial center, the project excavated three large residential sites from 1981 to 1984 that collectively offer a rich set of material ideally suited to address the issue of Maya social structure and power relations. By ex- posing the final phase construction of each site and then trenching, the project recovered information on architectural plans, construction techniques, trash deposits, in situ arti- facts, and interments. This methodology yielded an impressive sample of completely ex- posed buildings, of artifacts from primary and midden contexts, and of burials (Sanders 1986a). It has allowed me to concentrate on the in-depth study of the buildings and as- sociated artifacts from these three sites rather than on the generation of broad patterns (see Harrison 1970; Willey and Leventhal 1979). Such an approach both complements settlement pattern studies and reveals greater internal variation within residential sites than is usually accommodated in the broad categories typically used in the analysis of surface remains (see Hendon 1990). The Copan Valley The Valley of Copan lies in western Honduras at an elevation of 600 m above sea level. It is watered by the Copan River, which flows west-southwest, eventually draining into the Motagua River in Guatemala. Prehistoric settlement radiates out from the main civil- ceremonial center (the Main Group) to cover most of the fertile valley floor and enclosing foothills. Test-pitting and excavation programs carried out since 1975 have established the broad function and chronology of these sites (Fash 1983b; Freter 1988; Webster and Gonlin 1988; Willey and Leventhal 1979). Most served as places where people lived and most date from A.D. 650-1000, with some occupation continuing as late as A.D. 1200</page><page sequence="4">Hendon] STA TUS AND POWER IN CLASSIC MAYA SOCIETY 897 (Viel 1983; Webster and Freter 1990; Willey and Leventhal 1979). The basic settlement unit consists of the patio, made up of three or more structures arranged around an open courtyard. Closely spaced clusters of such patios are considered to be one site. In PAC terminology, these clusters are known as groups and are numbered using a valleywide grid system (Fash 1983b). Baudez (1983), Longyear (1952), and Sanders (1986b, 1990) dis- cuss the valley's physical and archeological features in depth. The three groups studied here appear in Figure 1. They are Gr. 9N-8, one of the largest in the valley with at least fifteen patios, Gr. 9M-22, a three-patio group, and Gr. 9M-24, which has only one patio (Hendon 1987:75-80). Figures 2-4 show the patios (designated by letters) and structures of each group after excavation (see Hendon 1987:ch. 4 for in- dividual structure descriptions). I focus on 54 buildings from Patios A-F, H, K, and Al- pha of Gr. 9N-8, 24 from Patios A and B of Gr. 9M-22, and 5 from Gr. 9M-24. Although a large burial sample from all excavations is currently under analysis (Storey 1985, 1986), I will discuss only the subset for which detailed information on grave goods and type of interment is already available. 8 9 10 11 K L M N 9N-8 Gr 9M-24 Gr 9M-22 Main Group Copan River Figure 1 Inner zone of Copan Valley showing location of Groups 9N-8, 9M-22, and 9M-24.</page><page sequence="5">898 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 Dominant Structure Dominant Structure I Dominant Structure D C B H SRitual Structures Dominant Structure A Ritual Structure E Ritual Structure Dominant Structure F N o lOnm Figure 2 Excavated patios of Group 9N-8. Activity Distribution and Building Use in the Copan Valley As a first step in creating a model of ancient Maya social structure, I focus on identi- fying the kinds of activities ordinarily carried out in residential sites and their association with particular kinds of structures. Of necessity, such an analysis cannot be based solely on the form or distribution of the structures themselves but must also, and primarily, concentrate on an adequate collection of associated artifacts. Merely charting the distri- bution of artifacts across space is also inadequate; one must consider the kinds of artifacts as well as their location. For the Copan settlement, a large data base is available that incorporates a wealth of architectural and artifact information on the excavated structures. I have used as many kinds of artifacts from primary contexts as possible.

In my analysis, which is summarized here and presented in detail in Hendon (1987, 1988, 1989, 1991), I chose five classes of activities as most pertinent to the examination of res- idential areas: (1) food preparation and cooking, (2) food serving and consumption, (3) ritual observances, (4) manufacturing and production, and (5) storage. A sixth class, sleeping, was also included, although no artifacts were associated with it (Hendon 1987:ch. 1; 1989). The summary presented below stems from the comparison of the con- tent and location of these deposits. Their distribution has been studied through the iden- tification of artifacts' function (based on a comparison of formal properties, analogy with modern Mesoamerican groups, and use-wear analysis [Mallory 1984]), the evaluation of the kinds of activities from which these artifacts derived, and the location and spatial association of artifacts using both physical and statistical co-occurrences. Certain kinds of artifacts are studied most intensively because they seem to relate more to quotidian activities than to expressions of social status. These classes are: (1) ceramic vesselform, considered more meaningful than type, (2) ground-stone artifacts (principally manos and metates), (3) bone artifacts and unworked animal bone, and (4) lithic artifacts, both chert and obsidian. The distribution of artifacts and activities in the data base as a whole has been studied using two statistical techniques, principal components analysis and cluster analysis. The two approaches produce complementary results that suggest common associations be- tween certain kinds of artifacts, which in turn suggest that they had been used in the same activities (Hendon 1987:ch. 5). As a second approach, I also look at the in situ material (features) to see what kinds of artifacts occurred together in these deposits and where these different sets occur (Hendon 1987:381-390). In addition, I divide the material from primary contexts by location-rooms, terraces, and platforms-and compare their rel- ative artifact frequencies and distribution using stem-and-leaf plots and chi-square anal- ysis (Hendon 1987:ch. 6; 1989). In this way I have been able to gather information on which activities predominate in these different locations. Once the distribution of artifacts representing these activities is established, it is pos- sible to examine their patterned relationships with various formal features of the struc- tures, such as building plan, room layout, and size. Among the possibilities investigated are (1) that certain activities occur more often in certain kinds of rooms or structures and (2) that activities overlap in distribution, indicating a multifunctional use of space. There are two basic types of structures in the inner zone, those with and those without super- structures. Those with superstructures are compared on the basis of the number of rooms present as well as on room layout, orientation, access, and interior details, such as benches, niches, ledges, and cord-holders. The amount of terrace space is also considered. Although the superstructures vary in size, number of rooms, arrangement, and furniture, certain regularities exist, some of which are discussed below. Those without superstruc- tures, here called platforms, have been compared in terms of location within patios, dis- tribution across patios, and size. The conjunction of these lines of evidence makes it possible to identify relationships between artifact distribution and certain regularities in building layout. Based on this work I have identified three major functional types of structures in the inner zone: (1) ancillary structures, (2) residential structures, and (3) ritual structures. The first cate- gory is the most uniform in form, distribution, and associated activities. The second type, residential structures, can be subdivided into several distinct spatial components-rooms without benches, rooms with benches, and terraces. The fine-grained artifact studies have made it possible to show the kinds of activities associated with these components. Ritual structures are variable in form, location, and distribution. Ancillary Structures The first distinct type consists of buildings used as storehouses and as cooking and food-preparation areas. Artifacts from deposits associated with these structures display</page><page sequence="8">Hendon] STATUS AND POWER IN CLASSIC MAYA SOCIETY 901 a consistent and statistically significant preponderance of large and small jars and small bowls with restricted necks, whose formal properties and similarity to modern and his- toric Maya vessels lead me to interpret them as storage vessels (see Hendon 1987:314- 361, 456-473; 1988, for a discussion of vessel form and function). Food-preparation ar- tifacts, such as three-pronged braziers, manos, and metates, also occur. A general lack of the decorated bowls, plates, and cylinders used for food serving and of the censers used in ritual observances further characterizes these deposits. They also lack evidence for manufacturing activity, such as bone needles, awls, or spindle whorls. Most of the plat- forms have associated midden deposits as well. This distinctive artifact profile coordinates with a unique set of architectural traits. All except two of these ancillary structures are platforms that either never supported a build- ing at all or had a superstructure built entirely of perishable materials. The two excep- tions, in Gr. 9M-24, have low cobble wall bases supporting perishable walls. Such con- struction contrasts with the residential structures in the inner zone, where stone walls predominate. Size also differentiates ancillaries from residences. Out of a sample of nine- teen, all but two are under 25.0 m2 in surface area. In fact, the entire set of ancillary structure areas falls within the range of most individual rooms in residential structures (Hendon 1987:figs. 6.3-6.5). Although consistent in size, ancillary structures are quite inconsistent in distribution. Of the nineteen identified, thirteen are in Gr. 9M-22, while Gr. 9M-24 has two (Figures 2, 4). Gr. 9N-8, despite being the largest group, has only four: three in or near Patio C and one in Patio H. Half of the platforms abut the backs or sides of residential structures. Some of these are very low constructions. The rest, however, are as high or only slightly lower than their adjacent residential structures. The remaining ones, which are free- standing, are found in the corners of the patio or behind residential structures, often out- side the boundaries of the patio area. These patterns of size, location, and construction only come together in a meaningful way when considered in conjunction with the artifact distribution data referred to earlier. It is the confluence of these regularities that causes me to identify the structures as storage and food-preparation, rather than living, space. Residential Structures Based on artifact clusters and architectural features, most of the structures in the three sites fall into this category. Functionally, residential structures are used for sleeping and many tasks associated with daily living. In the Copan Valley, this includes not only food preparation and consumption but ritual observances and small-scale specialized produc- tion as well (Hendon 1989; see also Gonlin 1985; Webster and Gonlin 1988). Formally, residential structures stand apart from ancillary ones through the possession of a partially or completely stone superstructure built on top of the raised substructure. The top of the substructure surrounding the superstructure forms a paved open space referred to as a terrace. Traits distinguishing the superstructures from one another include number of rooms, room access and orientation, and presence or absence of a bench. Benches are built-in furniture constructed of a dirt-and-cobble fill retained by one or more stone walls topped by a cobble paving and often a thick coat of lime plaster. They come in three shapes- rectangular, L-shaped, and U-shaped. Ledges, niches, and cord-holders are examples of other built-in features. Many rooms, even in multiroom superstructures, have their own doorway onto the terrace, face onto the patio's courtyard, and have one rectangular bench. Some rooms with benches are built on the ends of the superstructures and face away from the courtyard. There is also a class of rooms that cannot be entered directly from the terrace and usually lack a bench. Benchless rooms serve as the functional equivalents of ancillary structures based on in situ artifacts and statistical associations. Artifacts related to cooking, food preparation, and storage, such as metates, three-pronged braziers, and large basins, dominate these assemblages (Hendon 1987:ch. 5; 1988). In one case, ballgame paraphernalia was stored</page><page sequence="9">902 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 in a residential structure in Patio A of Gr. 9N-8 (Webster, Fash, and Abrams 1986). A quite different set of activities can be inferred from yet another in situ deposit. Two rooms in Patio H's western structure contained clear evidence of the production of shell orna- ments and the storage of associated materials (Hendon 1987:228-232; Widmer 1983). The location of rooms without benches contrasts markedly with the storage platforms, however. Most of these rooms are found in Gr. 9N-8 (10 of 17). Small, with an area usu- ally under 7.0 m2, close to three-quarters of these rooms open into another room rather than onto the terrace. Patio Alpha of Gr. 9N-8 has two rooms with benches that contained in situ material like that found in benchless rooms (Hendon 1987:table 5.31). These rooms are part of a complex of five rooms around a paved area built in the small space between Patios B and H (see Figure 2). Access to Patio Alpha is restricted to a single corridor between the north and central superstructures of Patio H's western building. Thus, although they have benches, these sequestered rooms are as difficult to get to as the benchless rooms else- where in the group. A very high percentage (between 60% and 90%) of the rooms studied possess at least one bench, which takes up from 60% to 80% of the available room area and almost in- variably sits opposite the entrance. Most such rooms have their own entrance leading onto the terrace. The varying combinations of artifacts in the primary deposits associated with these rooms suggest a wide range of activities (Hendon 1988, 1989). Artifacts indic- ative of food serving (e.g., cylinders, plates, and small decorated bowls and dishes) and artifacts representing ritual activities are common. In addition, some rooms were the lo- cus of production of certain items such as shell or bone objects or, in Gr. 9M-24, obsidian tools. This indicates that both rooms with and without benches were used for such pur- poses. Working of shell as well as animal bone probably took place in rooms with benches in Patios D and H, as well as in the benchless room already described. Tools related to weaving (bone picks), spinning (spindle whorls), and sewing (bone needles) occur most frequently in room contexts. Their distribution indicates that activities related to cloth production were fairly widespread in Gr. 9N-8 and Gr. 9M-22 (cf. Freter 1988:197; Sand- ers 1989). Several studies have suggested that benches were used as sleeping and sitting platforms in Lowland Maya residences (Adams 1970; Harrison 1970:152-174). These conclusions are based on the size of the bench and its placement within the room, as well as on the occurrence of cord-holders, which may have supported some sort of partition. Other in- dicators are the presence of wall niches that might have been used for storage, a generally domestic constellation of artifacts, and similarities between the actual benches and ones depicted in painted or carved scenes. All of these criteria are found in Copan's inner zone, with the addition of a much larger artifact data base with more specific contextual associations than is usually available. Wall niches and narrow ledges are found in some benched rooms, while cord-holders occur in a number of rooms on the inside of the front wall. The location of cord-holders can be seen as determining who controls access to the building's interior space (Hohmann and Vogrin 1982:80-81). The fact that all structures whose cord-holders are preserved have them on the inside walls indicates that their use was controlled by people inside the rooms. Cases where a benchless room attaches to one with a bench form a suite, with the side rooms serving as the storage area. Not all rooms with benches have an associated storage room, however. Some of these rooms have a narrower bench, leaving a small side area, which could have served as a less private substitute. Numerous ancillary structures make up for this lack in Gr. 9M-22 and Gr. 9M-24. It would have been much easier to limit access to benchless rooms or side areas than to platforms, suggesting a greater control of storage space in Gr. 9N-8 and in certain structures of the two other groups. Such differ- ences in location and type of storage space may indicate a greater atomization of storage and food preparation in Gr. 9N-8 than in Gr. 9M-22 or Gr. 9M-24. It does not necessarily</page><page sequence="10">Hendon] STATUS AND POWER IN CLASSIC MAYA SOCIETY 903 follow, however, that only the residents of the adjacent living room had rights to the con- tents of the rooms or to the results of the activities carried out therein. The social orga- nization of the residents of the different structures in the patio determined use of the spaces or of the items they contained. The spatial patterns do imply that control of these spaces was probably greater in Gr. 9N-8 and that access to the rooms themselves was correspondingly more restricted. All of the residential structures have wide front terraces running the length of the sub- structure. Two factors suggest that terraces were more than walkways facilitating move- ment from one room to another. The first is the presence of in situ artifact deposits on some terraces. Food-preparation (grinding stones, obsidian blades, jars, and animal bone), food-serving (decorated plates and cylinders), ritual (censers and figurines), and weaving artifacts are common components of terrace primary deposits (Hendon 1987:table 5.31). Statistical comparison of terrace deposits with those of rooms and plat- forms suggests that cooking, indicated by a higher-than-expected frequency of comals and three-pronged braziers, took place outside of the superstructures on the terraces as well as on platforms (Hendon 1989). The second factor that indicates the importance of terraces is the construction of raised platforms. The placement of many of these elevated terraces, flanking superstructure en- trances, actually impedes movement between rooms or superstructures. Other raised ter- races attach to the side of the superstructure. Most elevated terraces are under 7.0 m2 although the side terraces tend to be much larger than the front ones. The artifacts in terrace deposits, as suggested above, reflect most strongly activities related to food preparation, such as maize grinding, food processing (especially of meat), and cooking. The conjunction of the artifacts with a specific architectural feature leads me to interpret elevated terraces as deliberately constructed workbenches to be used by the occupants of the nearby residence for tasks requiring good light (e.g., weaving) and/ or ventilation (e.g., cooking). The terrace can thus be added to the rooms as an integral part of a residence. At its most elaborate, then, a Copan Valley residence has not only a suite of rooms for living and storage but a large exterior work space as well. Therefore, it is not surprising that elevated terraces are more common in Gr. 9N-8 and Gr. 9M-24 (perhaps providing space for obsidian tool production) than in Gr. 9M-22 with its nu- merous ancillary platforms. Ritual Structures There are six structures distinguished from residential and ancillary structures both by their architectural form and the associated artifacts (Hendon 1987:ch. 7; 1989; see also Gerstle 1985). They distribute unevenly across the three groups-none in Gr. 9M-24, one in each of the two patios of Gr. 9M-22, and four in Gr. 9N-8 (see Figures 2-4 for their location). Although marked by a relative dearth of associated artifacts when compared to the other types of structures, those present tend to be related to ritual activities, such as censers, candeleros, and figurines. In contrast to the residences, they rarely have as- sociated caches or burials. Three of these structures, in Patios A and H of Gr. 9N-8 and Patio A of Gr. 9M-22, have a relatively higher and squarer substructure than do residences or ancillary plat- forms (see Figures 3 and 4 for their location). Furthermore, each has a predominantly or completely perishable superstructure with one large room and a poorly preserved, un- usually small bench. These three structures approximate to a certain extent the formal features of the temple as defined by Becker (1971) for Tikal and widely accepted since. The fourth ritual structure is a very small platform built in the courtyard of Gr. 9N-8's Patio E (Figure 3). It resembles, both in form and location, "mid-patio shrines" found at Mayapan (Proskouriakoff 1962) and elsewhere (Joyce 1986; Leventhal 1983). The fifth structure, located in Patio D of Gr. 9N-8, has a single large room with no bench and two entrances. The final structure, in Patio B ofGr. 9M-22, was worse preserved than most,</page><page sequence="11">904 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 making it difficult to say anything about its form (Figure 4). It is, however, a large, free- standing substructure with no obvious superstructure (see Mallory 1984). The identification of these structures as ritual is thus based partly on resemblances to buildings so interpreted at other Mesoamerican sites. Of equal importance, however, are the differences from the other kinds of structures in the three groups-the absence of middens behind the substructures, the lack of benches or their small size relative to that of the room, and the differences in form. As noted above, two commonly cited features of ritual structures, especially temples- burials and caches-are missing or rare. The lack of burials suggests that, unlike those found at civic-ceremonial centers, inner zone temples did not serve primarily as funerary monuments. Caches are associated with only two ritual structures. The temple in Patio H contained a cylindrical censer housing a Spondylus shell and a carved greenstone pec- toral (Gerstle 1985). The building in Patio D had a dog buried below the floor of its large room (Gerstle 1988). In contrast, most residential caches consist of a single polychrome bowl, plain cylinder, or cylindrical censer, although manos have also been found (Hen- don 1987:ch. 4; Willey and Leventhal 1979). They are usually found well inside the fill of the structure, placed at the time of construction of a new version of the building. Summary of Activities and Their Distribution To sum up, then, I have identified certain distributional patterns that indicate varia- tion in the location and organization of domestic, economic, and ritual activities. Evi- dence for essential activities of daily living, including food preparation, food consump- tion, and storage, is found in all patios examined, but in different locations. Independent platforms are used in Gr. 9M-22 and Gr. 9M-24 for storage and food preparation as op- posed to benchless rooms and terraces in Gr. 9N-8. Gr. 9M-24 also uses terraces perhaps in connection with the production of obsidian tools. Some terraces, especially in Gr. 9N- 8, have been improved as work areas by the addition of an exterior bench. Specialized production exists, but on a very small scale. Gr. 9N-8 residents concen- trated on such high-status items as shell jewelry and, possibly, bone objects. In contrast, Gr. 9M-24's residents produced obsidian blades, the basic tool in the Copan Valley. Weaving tools and unworked bone found in a number of rooms indicate that other pro- duction, possibly of utilitarian items for household use, also took place. Finally, ritual activities can be analyzed on two levels. First, the distribution of ritual artifacts shows that religion was an integral part of residential group life (Hendon 1989). Second, the occurrence of special ritual structures is uneven, as they are not found in all patios studied. Evidence for Ranking and Stratification in the Copan Valley The repeated occurrence of the basic activities considered here suggests that each patio functioned as a separate social-residential unit. Overall, the distribution of activities in- dicates a degree of autonomy on the part of each patio, counteracted only by the uneven distribution of ritual structures in Gr. 9N-8. As I have suggested elsewhere (Hendon 1989), the location of a ritual structure between Patios A and B suggests it was shared by their residents and possibly those of Patio C. This is the only example of supra-patio ritual integration in the three groups. Nevertheless, despite their evident organizational inde- pendence, differences exist in the distribution of building material and architectural dec- oration, of certain kinds of artifacts, and of burials, within and across patios. These dif- ferences provide evidence of unequal access to resources and energy, allowing us to eval- uate the existence and nature of ranking within the patio-based residential unit and of stratification (as defined earlier) within and across the three groups. Architectural Materials and Decoration Comparison of the three groups to one another and to the Main Group and other ex- cavated sites (e.g., Webster and Gonlin 1988; Wiley and Leventhal 1979) reveals a series</page><page sequence="12">Hendon] STA TUS AND POWER IN CLASSIC MA YA SOCIETY 905 of contrasts in building material, layout, and decoration. Superstructures in the Copan Valley, for example, may be built completely of stone, of a combination of stone and per- ishable materials, or entirely of wattle-and-daub. The stone used may be roughly faced river cobbles, shaped blocks of green tuff, or finely dressed tuff ashlars. The latter pre- dominates in the Main Group, while wattle-and-daub houses are most common in the outer zone (Hohmann and Vogrin 1982; Webster and Gonlin 1988). Three kinds of roofs are known-vaulted, beam-and-mortar, and thatch. Energetic studies by Abrams (1989) and Gonlin (1985) have demonstrated that the greater permanence and visual impact of stone construction, particularly when using ashlars, require a correspondingly greater expenditure of time and/or labor. The difference between perishable and stone construction in the inner zone is mostly functional. As detailed above, perishable structures are by and large storage and food- preparation loci, although some are ritual structures. Stone structures are either resi- dences or ritual buildings. Most of these superstructures use a mixture of tuff ashlars and cobbles. The tuff is generally placed on the front of the building, while cobbles form the back and side walls, suggesting a desire to display the tuff as prominently as possible (Hendon 1987:ch. 4; 1991). Although considerable variation exists within each group, it is instructive first to compare the three groups to one another. Over half (57.6%) of Gr. 9N-8's superstructures use only stone and around one-third have vaulted or beam-and- mortar roofs. In contrast, only 15% of Gr. 9M-22's superstructures, either residential or ritual in function, have completely stone walls or nonthatched roofs. Twenty percent of Gr. 9M-24's buildings have stone walls, but all have thatched roofs (Hendon 1987:121- 125). Eight residences and one temple have architectural decoration in the form of sculpture or hieroglyphic inscriptions. Seven residences and the temple are in Gr. 9N-8; the other residence is in Gr. 9M-22. Within Gr. 9N-8, the decorated buildings are concentrated in Patios A (four), B (two), C (one), and D (one). A greal deal of contrast is evident in the visibility of the sculpture-in terms of quantity, size, and placement on the building- and its themes, whether portraits of individuals, supernaturals, animals, or abstract mo- tifs. One can arrange the buildings in a hierarchy of decreasing visibility of decoration and specificity of theme (Hendon 1991). The most complex and detailed ornamentation is found on Structure 9N-82C, the southern building of Gr. 9N-8's Patio A, and Structure 9M-195B, Gr. 9M-22's decorated building. These two buildings have large figures placed high up on all four sides with a second set of figures lower down (Fash 1989; Sheehy 1981). Structure 9N-82C also has a bench carved with a long hieroglyphic inscription featuring a nonruling member of the elite (Riese 1989). The exterior sculpture or texts on the other buildings are all placed on the lower part of the front wall only. Several of the buildings have abstract sculpture; those cases of anthropomorphic or zoomorphic sculpture do not represent individuals. This contrasts with the upper figures on Patio A's southern building, which are held to be portraits of humans (Baudez 1989; Fash 1989). The one other text, on the northern building of Gr. 9N-8's Patio C, is much shorter than the hieroglyphic bench but also mentions a nonrul- ing elite (R. Joyce, personal communication, 1990). The use of tuff and the addition of decoration add to the energetic requirements of construction and the monumentality of the building (Abrams 1989; Trigger 1990). The themes and the texts are expressions of the same ideology displayed in the iconography and inscriptions of the ruler found in the center but with the emphasis shifted to the occupants of the residences (Hendon 1991; cf. Schele 1991). More generally, the elaboration of residences, both in their basic materials and their ornamentation, provides an example of the use of architecture to reinforce the social hierarchy by making visible differences in power-that is, differences in the control of energy, in access to resources, and in the ability to manipulate cultural symbols (Trig- ger 1990).</page><page sequence="13">906 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 Dominant Structures The data show status differences within each patio as well. Every completely excavated patio except H and Alpha of Gr. 9N-8 has at least one residential structure noticeably better built (cf. Gonlin 1985; Haviland 1968). These buildings, which I have called dom- inant structures, can be characterized as extremely finely constructed and highly deco- rated versions of the residential structures (Figures 2-4). Most dominant structures are on the north or west sides of the patios. They have higher substructures and more compact superstructures, and are of superior construction com- pared to others in their patio. These statements do not indicate, however, that for each patio only its dominant structure is well built and has a vaulted roof or decoration. Never- theless, these particular structures show a consistent association with these elements that is lacking in other structures. Patios as a whole also vary in the quality of construction and architectural elaboration of their buildings. Only the dominant structure in Patio E, for example, is built of dressed tuff with a vaulted roof. Furthermore, it is smaller and less decorated than almost all the structures of Patios A, B, or C. All but one of these structures has a multi-roomed superstructure with one large room facing onto the patio and one or two benchless side rooms or areas. In addition, one or more rooms with benches, oriented away from the patios, are built on the ends of the superstructure. The main room is large, with a generously proportioned rectangular bench. The independent, perpendicular rooms, on the other hand, are usually small and often have an L- or U-shaped bench. Formal tombs are found near some of these build- ings below the patio surface; less commonly they are found inside the substructures. Al- though not all such structures have nearby tombs, most of the contemporary tombs found in the excavations are associated with this sort of building. In contrast, the majority of burials in or near other structures lack any sort of formal grave, although they often have burial offerings. When compared to other residences, these dominant structures have less associated primary and midden material. What is present, however, indicates food serving or con- sumption and ritual but not food preparation. In all cases, however, one or more of the adjacent structures have clearly marked food-preparation areas. In some cases, a plat- form has been built next to or abutting the dominant structure. This is the case for Struc- ture 9M-195B in Gr. 9M-22's Patio A. In other cases, one of the neighboring superstruc- tures has one or more benchless rooms or terraces where food was prepared (see Hendon 1987:table 7.8). Although similar structures have been interpreted as "administrative" buildings or family lineage shrines (i.e., Leventhal 1983), their form and associated artifacts indicate to me that they are residences and "domestic" structures (see Gonlin 1985; Haviland 1968). Rather than indicating a different function, their better construction and greater decoration suggest a higher social rank for their occupants. The large size of the main room, with more bench and floor space than usual, suggests that it may also have been the site of meetings involving occupants of the other residences in the patio. At the same time, the size of the room may serve as a marker of the higher status of the building's residents. The ability to command a larger amount of interior space may be related more to social standing than to family size. This idea is supported by the fact that, despite a number of burials, all rooms in Gr. 9M-24, even in its dominant structure, are smaller than those in the other two groups. A hierarchy of dominant structures exists within either of the multi-patio groups (i.e., 9N-8 and 9M-22). In Gr. 9N-8, the dominant structure of Patio A, Structure 9N-82C, is the most elaborate and the largest of the entire group. Besides its exceptionally fine con- struction and sculpture, it has one of only three hieroglyphic benches reported to date outside of the Main Group. If may have had the most public function of any of these structures. However, I would still argue, on the basis of its form and associated artifacts, that it was used as living space. As noted earlier, the dominant structure of Gr. 9M-22's</page><page sequence="14">Hendon] STATUS AND POWER IN CLASSIC MAYA SOCIETY 907 Patio A, Structure 9M-195B, parallels that of Gr. 9N-8's Patio A in the quantity and placement of its exterior sculpture. Structure 9M-195B's western neighbor lacks the sculpture and is slightly smaller but otherwise is identical to the dominant structure in quality of construction and plan. Both of these buildings are larger and more impressive than Patio B's dominant structure. None of the other patios shows such a pairing. Imported and Local Fancy Ceramics Thirty percent of the ceramic rims from middens and primary contexts, the sample used in this section, are what I call fancy ceramics (Hendon 1987:317). I intend this term to reflect the complexity of their surface treatment. It refers to decoration and does not imply that such ceramics are necessarily nonutilitarian in function or more expensive to produce or acquire. They usually take the form of cylinders, bowls of various kinds, or tripod plates. My study of vessel function has shown that most were used for food serving and consumption in residential, domestic contexts despite their elaborate decoration, showing that type of decoration is not a good indicator of vessel use (Hendon 1987:326- 361). Their appearance in caches and burials, however, implies that such vessels also played an important part in certain rituals. Several prominent types of fancy ceramics, including Copador Polychrome, Gualpopa Polychrome, and Chilanga Red-on-Usulutan, have been shown definitively to have been produced within the Copan Valley (Beaudry 1984). Another set of fancy types are clearly imported. Given their symbolic role in the society and the presence of imports, repre- senting an exotic and scarce resource, the distribution of such ceramics may serve as an- other material expression of differences in social status. I have merged together related types to create four categories: Surlo, Copador Poly- chrome, Locally produced polychromes other than Copador (hereafter Local), and For- eign polychromes (described more fully in Hendon 1987:314-317; 1988). Surlo ceramics are distinguished by orange-brown paste and a variety of surface treatments including modeling, carving, and incising (Viel 1983). Almost 40% of the fancy ceramics consid- ered here belong to this category. Copador Polychrome, with a fine-grained, white-beige paste, the distinctive use of red paint containing specular hematite, and a suite of characteristic motifs, is held to be the hallmark of the Copan Late Classic (Longyear 1952; Willey and Leventhal 1979). Given this identification of Copan with Copador polychromes, it is interesting that only one- quarter of my sample in fact belongs to this type. The category of other local polychromes brings together types such as Caterpillar Poly- chrome, Gualpopa Polychrome, and Chilanga Red-on-Usulutan that have the same paste as Copador but lack specular hematite paint (Viel 1983). It also includes some related painted and incised types and eroded rims with appropriate paste. One-third of the fancy group are Local polychromes. The inclusion of eroded sherds has inflated this figure somewhat but not significantly. The final category, Foreign polychromes, contains all those whose decoration, form, and paste (based on macroscopic inspection) identify them as having been produced out- side of the valley. Viel's analysis (1983), unfortunately based on a small proportion of the ceramics recovered, indicates that the majority comes from central Honduras, an area that includes Lake Yojoa, the Naco Valley, and the Santa Barbara region (see alsoJoyce 1986, 1988). Others are of the type Arambala Polychrome, called False Copador by Longyear, and probably come from western El Salvador (see Beaudry 1984). The occurrence of each of these four groups in each patio appears in Table 1 as a per- centage of the total fancy rims in the patio's middens and primary contexts. Burials and caches are excluded. Clearly, Gr. 9N-8 has the most imported ceramics. Within the group, the occurrence parallels the architectural hierarchy discussed earlier. Patio A has the highest percentage (11.5) and Patios E and F the lowest (3.2) (see Gerstle 1988:118- 133 for an alternative analysis).</page><page sequence="15">908 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 Table 1 Distribution of fancy ceramics from middens and primary contexts in each patio of Groups 9N-8, 9M-22, and 9M-24.a Copador Local Surlo Imported Total fancy Group and Patio (%) (%) (%) (%) sherds 9N-8 Patio A 19.6 30.7 38.1 11.5 485 Patio B 32.4 12.5 48.2 6.9 926 Patio C 22.3 38.3 33.7 5.7 350 Patio Db 36.2 22.9 34.3 6.6 3,291 Patios E and F 30.9 35.0 30.9 3.2 786 Patio H 29.6 21.7 41.8 6.8 1,468 9M-22 Patio A 14.0 46.1 36.8 3.1 685 Patio B 14.6 63.4 22.0 0.0 2,385 9M-24 4.9 24.4 69.3 1.3 1,696 aExpressed as a percentage of total fancy sherds from each patio. bIncludes some material from Patios I and K. The indigenous fancy ceramics in the Gr. 9N-8 assemblages distribute fairly evenly with some variation in which category dominates. A very different pattern appears in the other two groups. In Gr. 9M-22, Local polychromes are heavily represented, especially at the expense of Copador. Gr. 9M-24, on the other hand, has a great amount of Surlo relative to the other fancy sherds. As expected, imports are much less available and ap- pear to correlate well with the intra- and intergroup social hierarchy based on the archi- tectural evidence. The representation of fancy ceramics at two other inner zone sites excavated in the 1970s by the Harvard University Copan Valley Settlement Pattern Project, Gr. 9N-18/ CV-43-47 and Gr. 9M-27/CV-20, has been reported by Beaudry (1984:228-233). From her data, one can see that 90.5% of fancy ceramics from the site of Gr. 9M-27 are Co- pador, 2.7% are Gualpopa Polychrome (a Local type), and 6.8% are Babilonia Poly- chrome (i.e., Foreign). For the site of Gr. 9M-18, 75% are Copador, 8.0% Gualpopa, and 2.0% Babilonia. Copador dominates the fancy ceramic assemblage of these two sites much more heavily than in Groups 9N-8, 9M-22, or 9M-24. However, the rarity of the Foreign ceramics is similar. Certain methodological differences may explain these differ- ences, at least in part. Beaudry considers only one of the several types merged in my Local polychrome class, does not include Surlo, and has no midden material to draw on. At the same time, these patterns may also reflect, in part, variation in preference for one or the other sort of locally produced polychrome. It is instructive to compare these inner zone samples with those found in the outer zone. Based on preliminary data supplied by Nancy Gonlin from the excavation of seven small sites, fancy ceramics make up 10% or less of the sherd assemblage from each site. From 88%-95% of the fancy ceramics from these sites were too eroded to type, but the dis- tinctive Copador/Local paste was obvious. Of the remaining, less than 1% are imports. In other words, fancy ceramics in general are less common in these outer-zone small sites, while the imported polychromes are almost nonexistent. On the other hand, Copador and Local polychromes dominate more clearly in the small sites' fancy assemblages than in the inner zone ones analyzed here. These data agree with Beaudry's analysis of earlier test-pitting operations, which found that fancy ceramics occur throughout the valley and that the locally produced ones predominate over imports (1984:223-228). Obsidian Despite the existence of local chert adequate for tool production, obsidian blades are the basic tool throughout the Copan Valley (Mallory 1984:258-259). Coming from the</page><page sequence="16">Hendon] STATUS AND POWER IN CLASSIC MAYA SOCIETY 909 Ixtepeque source in Guatemala (Freter 1988:108-113), obsidian was brought into the area in sufficient quantity to supply both the inner and outer zones. As mentioned earlier, several sites show evidence of intensive but small-scale blade production and use. Despite such specialization, Mallory's study of lithic manufacture shows that most residential groups produced their own tools as needed. Based on these data, access to obsidian was not restricted nor was production centralized. Ornaments The objects considered here are all items of personal adornment or use. The ornaments are made of imported materials, including "greenstone" (such as jade or serpentine), obsidian, shell or turtle shell, and local animal bone. They include earspools, beads, pen- dants, and, possibly, hair ornaments (Hendon 1987:311-313, 361-371). Such artifacts are found in small numbers in middens or primary contexts such as rooms. Gr. 9M-24 and Gr. 9M-22 Patio A have no examples at all, while Gr. 9N-8 Patio A has only a couple of bone ornaments. Most stone ornaments and pieces of worked shell, turtle shell, or bone are found in Patios B, D, or H of Gr. 9N-8 or Patio B of Gr. 9M-22. Because of the con- textual associations of most of the shell and bone from Patios D and H, however, their high numbers are due more to their being produced there than to their use as markers of social status. Figurines Based on a preliminary analysis of figurines and whistles from all contexts excavated by PAC II, almost 70% are imported from west and north of the Copan Valley (cf. Gers- tle 1988:115-117, 147-150). I have identified one group whose style and paste, a fine- grained orange micaceous clay, suggest an origin in the northern Ulua Valley or Central Alluvium, where such sites as Travesia and Santa Ana are found (Gordon 1898; Joyce 1985). A second group contains figurines with a paste similar to the first but without the inclusion of mica. This paste and their style indicate that they may have come from cen- tral Honduras around Lake Yojoa or possibly the southern part of the Ulua Valley (Bau- dez and Becquelin 1973; Joyce 1985). There is no real difference in the frequency of these two paste groups in my sample- 54% of the imported figurines have micaceous clay, while 47% do not. Unlike the or- naments, figurines are found in middens and primary contexts, such as on terraces or in rooms, in all patios of all groups (Gerstle 1988:117; Hendon 1987:tables 5.31, 6.24, 6.37). There seems to have been little emphasis on figurine manufacture but considerable im- portance placed on figurine possession and use. Burials One might argue that if the artifacts discussed above served primarily as markers of an individual's social rank or position, they would be rare in trash deposits or in situ remains. This expectation is borne out for the ornaments but not for the fancy ceramics or the figurines, suggesting a different social role for these objects. Fancy ceramics had quite a "utilitarian" function as receptacles for food and drink while at the same time indicating social differences among their users. Figurines, I believe, were important com- ponents of religious observances at the level of the residential unit, accounting for their widespread distribution. Therefore, in order to gain more insight into material expressions of social structure, I will consider burial practices. I emphasize certain broad patterns, an approach necessi- tated by incomplete publication of the data and ongoing skeletal analysis (Storey 1985, 1986). A progression of interment types can be seen starting with stone-walled, vaulted tombs with niches, like ones found in the Main Group (Joyce 1986; Longyear 1952), and moving to smaller, unvaulted stone-lined crypts. A third type is marked by direct placement in dirt or building fill. The body is placed with care, usually in a flexed position, and it is</page><page sequence="17">910 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 probable that a grave was originally dug. The final type is not strictly speaking a kind of burial at all, since the bodies are essentially "thrown away" with no care given as to placement. Location of burials is also patterned. Most tombs are either found below the courtyard floor in front of the dominant structure or within its substructure. Some patios such as Gr. 9N-8 C and E have tombs associated with other structures as well (see below). Crypt burials occur in substructures of nondominant structures or below the patio's surface. Burials in simple graves, the most common type, are placed along the fronts and sides of substructures below the patio. Unlike tombs and crypts, more than one burial of this type can be and often is associated with a single structure. Another place for graves is in the midden deposits found behind many buildings and some have also been found inside substructures. The throwaways also turn up in middens as well as substructure fill. In at least one case both simple graves and crypt burial were found in association with one building (Hendon, Fash, and Aguilar 1990). Plain Surlo cylinders and flaring-walled dishes are the most common ceramics placed in vaulted tombs. Usually two of each were included, placed in the wall niches. Shell or greenstone earspools, pendants or "buttons" (i.e., objects sewn on clothing), obsidian blades, stingray spines, and Spondylus shells also appear. Other fancy ceramics are found in tombs as well, including Foreign, Local, and Copador polychromes (see also Beaudry 1984; Gerstle 1988). Crypts have a similar range of offerings. Burials in graves usually lack pottery or the more elaborate sorts ofjewelry. Ceramic beads, bone tools, or obsidian blades are more common. Figurines have also been found in burials of both adults and children (Gerstle 1988:157, 182-186; Webster, Fash, and Abrams 1986:228). There are two known examples, both in Gr. 9N-8, of tombs or crypts in residential structures whose contents were removed by later occupants. In each case, the tomb, lo- cated in the substructure, was cleaned out and filled with dirt prior to construction of the next phase of the building (Diamanti 1992; Hendon et al. 1990). As noted above, a second tomb is found in association with the dominant structure for both patios. A wealth of data on social organization and status exists in the PAC II burial sample, which can be touched on only briefly here. Comparison across patios is difficult because of incomplete data, but a few observations are possible. Neither Gr. 9M-24 nor Patio A of Gr. 9N-8 has tombs or well-made crypt burials (Gonlin 1985; Webster, Fash, and Abrams 1986). This lack in Gr. 9M-24 may be seen as another instance of its relative lack of resources and prestige compared to the other groups. Such an explanation does not work for Patio A, however. Excavation of this patio put less emphasis on structure trench- ing, however, and this may account for the overall low number of burials (Storey 1986). Within patios, social differences among the individual residents appear clearly in the range of burial types and offerings. Even Gr. 9M-24 shows this through the variety of mortuary goods, despite the lack of variation in interment type. A few burials have fancy ceramics or greenstone associated, while the rest have nothing (Gonlin 1985). Storey's (1985, 1986) preliminary remarks show that such variation is not solely by sex or age, although more tomb occupants are adult males than females or subadults. The emptying of tombs in two patios when rebuilding the associated structures suggests that preemi- nence in the residential-social group could shift over time. We do not know what was done with the original contents of the tombs. However, in at least one case, a secondary burial, possibly of bones from the tomb itself, was created. In Patio C, disarticulated bones were found above the replaced capstones of the emptied tomb along with three fancy vessels. This makes the deposit look much more like a cache than a true burial. A Model of Maya Social Structure In the preceding pages, I have argued that each patio was a residential unit by showing the occurrence of such basic domestic activities as cooking, storage, sleeping, eating, and production for household use. This constellation of activities is repeated in each of the</page><page sequence="18">Hendon] STATUS AND POWER IN CLASSIC MAYA SOCIETY 911 patios studied here with consistent architectural associations. Artifacts used in ritual ob- servances, such'as censers, figurines, and candeleros, occur in all patios in intimate as- sociation with residences. Production of basic necessities, such as obsidian tools and cloth, is dispersed. In contrast, specialized manufacture of shell and bone ornaments is concentrated in Patios D and H of Gr. 9N-8. It is this repetition and lack of specialization that lead me to see the patios or, more properly, their occupants as enjoying a great deal of economic and religious autonomy. Based on the evidence for shared ritual activities, economic self-sufficiency, and resi- dence, it seems clear that the people living in each patio formed a corporate social group defined not only by shared residence but also by kinship. The large number of burials of both sexes found in all patios, ranging in age from neonates to mature adults, strongly supports this interpretation (Storey 1985). Physically linked residential structures also suggest close social ties. In many cases, two or more independent superstructures share the same substructure. Others, once freestanding, are joined by the interpolation of new rooms. Substructures also merge with their neighbors to form L- or U-shaped platforms (see Figures 2 and 3). The two multi-patio groups represent examples of larger social groupings. Certain physical remains suggest a great deal of cooperation and amity among residents of the patios. Patios A and B of Gr. 9N-8 share a raised, artificial platform. Patios B and C share an actual building, which simultaneously forms the west side of Patio B and the east side of C (see Figure 2). Although all the rooms face onto Patio B, a staircase built on the opposite side leads from the courtyard of Patio C to the building's rear terrace. Once on the terrace, one can walk into Patio B at the south end of the building. In addition, three small rooms that face onto Patio C and were clearly used by its residents abut the north wall of this shared building (Hendon et al. 1990; Hendon, Fash, and Aguilar 1990). Patio Alpha is an example of wall sharing that involves three patios. Rear walls of structures from Patio B, Patio D, and Patio H became room walls for the five small rooms built in the narrow space between these patios. In Gr. 9M-22, abutting low platforms that were used for food preparation filled the space between Patios A and B (Hendon 1987:507-512). Another indicator of social integration is the sharing of a possible ritual structure by Patios A, B, and C of Gr. 9N-8. Counterbalancing this autonomy and cooperation is the marked variation within and across patios in residential construction and decoration, mortuary offerings, and posses- sion of certain imported goods. These patterns indicate unequal access to resources and human energy. They also indicate differences in the use and, by implication, the right to use material symbols of cultural significance (Hendon 1991; Trigger 1990). Access to for- eign polychrome ceramics, shell, and greenstone is more restricted because of their im- portance as markers of social status. The other main imports, obsidian and figurines, did not fill this role and therefore are much more widely distributed in domestic and ritual contexts. All patios and, by extension, all three groups show this internal variation. Such phys- ical hierarchy, which I take to reflect a social hierarchy, is most strongly marked in Gr. 9N-8. The use of ancillary structures in Groups 9M-22 and 9M-24, versus benchless rooms in Gr. 9N-8, shows differences in the allocation and control of space and in the activities carried out in that space. Not only are the ancillary structures more accessible but they are often associated with more than one residential structure (see Figures 3 and 4). This suggests in turn that a larger subsection of the residents of Groups 9M-22 and 9M-24 shared the use of each ancillary structure for food preparation and storage than in Gr. 9N-8, where benchless rooms are generally associated with a single superstructure. These patterns of domestic autonomy, cooperation, and nested social differentiation suggest the existence of a stratified society that clearly distinguishes among groups of individuals but also emphasizes strongly the descent group and the importance of kinship ties (cf. Kan 1989:84-101). Ranking within the descent group, based possibly on some combination of birth order, gender, and individual genealogy (as suggested by epigraphic</page><page sequence="19">912 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 evidence), would result in the variation in architecture and burials found within the pa- tios (cf. Goldman 1970). The most senior members would occupy the dominant struc- tures and be buried in the tombs. Ranking among the descent groups would lead in turn to a stratified elite marked by the uneven distribution of well-built residences, architec- tural decoration, and rich burials within the area around the Main Group. An alternative explanation for the within-patio differences, and specifically for the smaller and shoddier houses, is that they were used by servants employed by the resident family (Haviland 1968; Leventhal 1981). This interpretation assumes a more contrac- tual, less kinship-oriented relationship. It seems to me more likely that these houses were those of lower-ranking members of the descent group or other bilateral kin, whose rela- tionship gave them the right to reside in the patio but whose low rank or indirect con- nection placed them in a subservient position. Although they may have functioned essen- tially as servants, both their obligations and their rights were determined by kinship, not contract. Such people may be represented by those burials relatively poor in offerings that nevertheless are carefully placed below the patio floor or behind the structures. Although quality and quantity of offerings differentiate these burials from richer ones, their place- ment does not. I interpret these descent groups as localized, ranked lineages consisting of several gen- erations of kin sharing descent from common, known, and venerated ancestors. Each pa- tio contains one such lineage, while each group forms a larger, more inclusive "maximal lineage" or clan (Sanders 1989). The existence and importance of genealogy and ancestor worship to the Maya may be inferred from their delineation in contemporaneous inscrip- tions (Schele 1991), in historic Maya societies (Tozzer 1941), and through the application of more general ethnographic analogy (Carrasco 1976; Goldman 1970; Kan 1989). Most discussions of ancient Maya lineages have assumed them to be patrilineal (e.g., Haviland 1968; Hopkins 1988; Kurjack 1974; Sanders 1989). However, records of descent from women and of women title holders in hieroglyphic monuments, of the inheritance of titles from matrilineal kin and ancestors in Late Postclassic Yucatan, and the occurrence of women in tombs suggest that the matriline also had significance in determining certain rights (Fox and Justeson 1986; Joyce 1981; Tozzer 1941:98-99). Like many similar societies, the Maya emphasized descent as the source of rank and entitlement because of their belief in the divine origin of secular power (Demarest 1989; Tate 1986). Descent not only orders a group of living relatives but also determines close- ness to the powerful apotheosized ancestors and other supernaturals. In other words, de- scent from senior members of the lineage may be more significant than from one partic- ular sex. This leads to the acceptance of multiple determinants (such as seniority) at the expense of preservation of a strict unilineality. The very ambiguity of such a system al- lows a society more flexibility in the distribution of power and assignment of rank. This type of descent group, which Goldman has called a "status lineage," provides ways to overcome the inevitable disjunction between personal ability and socially mandated role to which any aristocratic political system is at times subject (Goldman 1970:418-430; Kan 1989). I conceive of these status lineages as multigenerational extended families. Sanders (1989), in a recent discussion of this same issue, has postulated widespread polygyny, at least among the residents of Gr. 9N-8. Because each patio has a finite number of rooms, an increase in the number of wives for any one lineage member would leave less room for adults of succeeding generations and their families. His argument is grounded mainly in the structure of certain African societies seen as appropriate analogs and on an apparent preponderance of female adult burials in Patios E and F (Webster 1989). The activities carried out in Patio E and the presence of a dominant structure, however, conform to the social model of residential status lineages outlined in this paper. Polygyny has not been given much weight for the Classic Maya, perhaps because there is no clearly established reference to it in the inscriptions and the ethnohistoric documents conflict. Certainly later societies in Mesoamerica practiced this form of marriage among</page><page sequence="20">Hendon] STATUS AND POWER IN CLASSIC MAYA SOCIETY 913 the elite, including the Mixtec (Spores 1984) and even, possibly, the Postclassic Maya of Yucatan (Tozzer 1941:100-101). This is not a question easily decided on the basis of the available archeological evidence. Completion of the skeletal analysis may indeed show the presence of more adult females than males. The question remains open, however, as to why this imbalance exists. It may reflect problems of sampling and preservation (Sto- rey 1985). It may also reflect something about the makeup of the residential group, but the social identity of the women remains open. They may have been wives; they may have been sisters and daughters (i.e., members of the lineage). At present, the issue cannot be resolved. While not ruling out multiple marriages for lineage heads, my own opinion is that the majority of the residences were occupied by married adult kin, not additional wives. The hierarchical nature of Maya society can be explained in large part by the existence of these ranked and stratified status lineages whose power and importance were but- tressed by control over tangible assets, such as land and people, but were grounded fun- damentally in their descent and associated ritual powers (Adams 1975; Demarest 1989; Godelier 1978). Clearly, high rank was not limited to the ruling lineage. Rather, the royal lineages form the top of an elite stratum made up primarily of groups like those found in the sites studied here. At the same time, the elite are members of social groups that also contain people of lower rank, possibly even commoners. Their primary loyalties may have been to their immediate status lineage and its larger maximal lineage or clan rather than to their fellow elite or to the ruler. Thus, although the elite constitute a definite entity they are not really a separate class (Kan 1989:83-101). Heretofore I have concentrated on the area immediately around the Main Group. Ex- cavations using a comparable methodology in the outer zone have not sampled the full range of sites, concentrating rather on the smallest ones (Webster and Gonlin 1988). This sample is not appropriate for the kind of cross-site comparisons I have carried out here. Nevertheless, I would extend my model to include the rural zone where the similarity in site layout, the general residential function, and the preponderance of small sites lead me to conclude that lower-rank lineages or lower-ranked members of the inner zone lineages lived here. Sites in the outer zone are not uniformly smaller or less well built, however. A number of large sites with multiple patios, large structures, stone construction, and sculpture have been mapped and test-pitted (Fash 1983b; Freter 1988). Fash (1983a) has argued that they were built by families who achieved their position too late in the Late Classic period to build in the inner zone, but he does not explain the source of their rank or wealth beyond a general reference to feudalism. Given that access to land, labor, and products was mediated and structured by kinship, it seems likely that the elite exercised rights over all three, independent of the ruler. Although it is possible that large groups in the foothills represent an attempt by the ruler to break free of this framework through land grants to lower-ranking individuals or lineages, the relatively small size of the valley and large number of elite suggest that large tracts of unclaimed land did not exist by the Late Clas- sic period. Rather, I propose that the large rural groups were members of elite status lineages designated by their lineage to live outside of the inner core for economic or per- haps demographic reasons (cf. Sanders 1989). The Maya during the Late to Terminal Classic periods, as seen from the Copan Valley, were organized into a socially stratified society held together by a series of nested descent groups crosscut by differences in rank. These differences, which were created by rights to land, people, and ritual power, were validated by divine sanction, ancestor worship, and a strong aristocratic principle. Kinship structured social relations at all levels, including those between the ruler and the elite and the elite and the commoners. Although trade and craft production existed, they were not significant sources of socioeconomic power or political control.</page><page sequence="21">914 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [93, 1991 Notes Acknowledgments.
