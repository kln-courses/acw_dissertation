<plain_text><page sequence="1">* Ricardo Estrada. Unos cuentos y cabeza que no siento. Guatemala City. Editorial Universitaria. 1965. 152 pages. In the five stories that make up this collection the author - a professor of literature at the University of Guatemala - puts the Guatemal- an tropical forest in the foreground of his nar- rations. His presentation of innumerable native birds and trees, his insistent explanations of natural phenomena, and his anthropomorph- ization of jungle life blend in a fable-like tex- ture which local critics have compared favor- ably with the Mayan legends of the mythologi- cal Popol Vuh. While the author's intentions are clear and aesthetically justified, the over- abundance of Indian vocabulary and a delib- erately "epic" style make the reading difficult for the unprepared reader.
