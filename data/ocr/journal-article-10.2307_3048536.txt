<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Trinity College Apocalypse, intro. Peter H. Brieger, transcription and translation of text Marthe Dulong, London, Eugrammia Press, 1967, 2 vols. Vol. I, pp. 56, 96 illus.; Vol. II, facsimile, pp. 64. ?126. A third great illustrated Apocalypse facsimile has now been issued by the Eugrammia Press in London-this time of the well-known Trin- ity College manuscript in Cambridge, Ms R.16.2. Having previously produced hand- some editions of Diirer's woodcuts and the engravings of Duvet, Eugrammia has now attacked the far more complex problem of re- producing an illuminated manuscript. The meticulously done reproductions come excep- tionally close to the quality of the original, catching many of the subtle gradations of tone, though the rich, soft, mat qualities of the color are difficult to convey; in some cases the or- anges are too red, and the blues too intense. The seemingly impossible task of reproducing the effect of the burnished gold of the original has been solved in part by the actual use of gold leaf. Therefore one has much the same awareness of sumptuous preciousness that one has in handling the original, which is an ele- gant, even ostentatious manuscript. In quality of reproduction this volume far surpasses the 1909 facsimile issued in a limited edition by the Roxburghe Club, which had an introduc- tion by M. R. James (The Trinity College Apocalypse, A Reproduction in Facsimile of the Manuscript R.16.2 in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, London, 1909, Roxburghe Club, No. 55). The manuscript is thus made available for study to those who have not had access to the original or to the facsimile. In a separate accompanying volume there is an introductory essay by Professor Peter Brie- ger of the University of Toronto, as well as a complete transcription of the French commen- tary, with English translation, prepared by Marthe Dulong. These latter texts have been placed alongside and underneath small black and white photographs of the illuminations, which are described in detail by Professor Brieger; the appropriate folio numbers and Biblical text references are in the margins. This</page><page sequence="2">200 The Art Bulletin intelligently planned layout makes it possible to use the explanatory volume without constant reference to the facsimile. Though the Trinity Apocalypse is often re- ferred to in discussions of English illuminated manuscripts of the thirteenth century, Profes- sor Brieger's study is the first separate essay on it since the 1909 study by M. R. James. The in- troductory essay provides a general descriptive introduction, and deals in part with critical problems of text, special characteristics, sources, style, dating, and provenance. In his introduction Brieger has gone con- siderably beyond previous studies in attempt- ing to define the specific sources of the illumi- nations or their models. (It is his assumption throughout that the Trinity Apocalypse "ush- ers in a new phase in the interpretation and il- lustration of this last book of the Bible ... .") Earlier surviving manuscript cycles of the Book of Revelation are those originating in the Caro- lingian Empire, those with the commentary of Beatus of Liebana stemming from Spain and the south of France, and those found in the twelfth-century Liber Floridus and its descend- ants. According to Brieger, the Trinity se- quence "follows mainly the Carolingian, non- Spanish tradition, especially that of Trier" (Stadtbibl. Ms 31). This statement is not doc- umented, and the six illustrations selected for comparison are only of instances where he wishes to show episodes in which Trinity de- viates from the Trier cycle. There are seventy- five scenes in the Trier cycle, seventy-one in the Trinity Apocalypse proper (excluding the twenty-seven scenes of the Life of St. John), so that the pacing of the two manuscripts is close. However, whereas Trier has individual scenes for the letters to the churches; Trinity does not. Trier has one scene in which the four horsemen are shown (though spatially they are isolated), folio 19, while there are four separate scenes in Trinity-folios 5-6v. A scene-by- scene comparison reveals many somewhat sim- ilar scenes based on the same Biblical texts, but if definitions are kept reasonably strict, there are no scenes with exactly the same num- ber of figures, similar gestures, and handling. This lack of precise parallels may be explained by the time interval between the execution of the two manuscripts, but, without intervening examples, one can demonstrate only the most general kind of possible dependence of the Trinity cycle on the earlier one. The relationships between certain scenes in the Trinity manuscript and some in the Liber Floridus Apocalypse cycle, as exemplified in Wolfenbiittel, Hertzog August Bibl. Cod. Gud. lat. 1.2, seem closer. These relationships are brought out clearly by the reproduction of six folios in the latter in which there are salient common characteristics. Dr. Freyhan used the same general parallel with the Liber Floridus scenes to support his argument that another of the Anglo-French Apocalypse manuscripts (New York, Morgan Ms 524) is the "arche- type" of the entire cycle (R. Freyhan, "Joa- chism and the English Apocalypse," JWarb, 18, 1955, 218). The problem of the relationship among various of the Anglo-French manu- scripts and their possible prototypes is a be- deviling one. For example, there appear to be closer parallels in certain scenes between the Liber Floridus Apocalypse cycle and other early Anglo-French Apocalypse manuscripts than between the Trinity cycle and the Liber Floridus cycle. These other Anglo-French man- uscripts all belong to a "first generation" or ca. 1260-or-before group, as does Trinity Ms R.16.2. One could just as easily use these detailed relationships to argue that others of these early manuscripts were more closely re- lated than the Trinity Apocalypse to the Liber Floridus prototype; for example: a. In the illustration of the Seven Churches in Wolfenbiittel, Cod. Gud. lat. 1.2., the angels are shown seated on top of the churches, fol. 9v. They are also shown seated on top of the churches in London, Lambeth Palace, Ms 209, fol. Iv. In Trinity, fol. 2v; New York, Pierpont Morgan Library Ms 524, p. 1, lower scene; and in Paris, Bibl. Nat. MS fr.403, fol. 6r, they are shown seated inside the churches. b. In the illumination of the Rider on the White Horse, Wolfenbiittel, Cod. Gud. lat. 1.2, fol. 11v, a hand from heaven is shown reach- ing down to place a crown on the head of the rider (Rev. 6:2). In Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403, fol. 7v, a hand from above reaches down and places a crown in the outstretched hand of the rider. This is not found in the Trinity Apoc- alypse, nor in Morgan Ms 524. Likewise, in that of the Rider on the Red Horse, Wolfen- biuttel, Cod. Gud. lat. 1.2, fol. 11v, a hand from the upper left gives the rider his sword (Rev. 6:4), and in Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403, fol. 8r, a hand from above does the same. This is in neither the Trinity nor Morgan manuscript. c. In the episode of the locust beasts (Rev. 9:1-11), in the Wolfenbiittel codex, fol. 12v, a hand on the upper left holds "the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit" (Rev. 9:1). In Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403, fol. 14r, a hand from within the "pit" holds up the key. Again, the hand is not found in the comparable episode in Trinity or Morgan. d. In the Liber Floridus the ascent of the witnesses (Rev. 11:11-13) is represented by showing them, full length and in profile, within a mandorla (Wolfenbiittel, Cod. Gud. lat. 1.2, fol. 14r); in Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403, the wit- nesses ascending are shown on the far right of a conflated scene, full length, in three- quarter view, within a cloudlike formation rem- iniscent of a mandorla. The witnesses ascend- ing are shown quite differently in Trinity, fol. 12v, while the episode is omitted in Morgan Ms 524. Are these even more precise relationships to the Liber Floridus cycle purely fortuitous, or are they the result of certain artists being more literal, or of having accidentally chosen ways of handling details that conform to the Liber Floridus cycle? Or might one consider the possibility that several different artists had available the same prototypes, "models," in- structions, and handled them differently? The relationships among these manuscripts are ex- asperatingly complex, and the constant impli- cation that the Trinity manuscript alone "ush- ers in the new phase," oversimplifies the problem. At the least, a few of the problems of establishing precise relationships might have been suggested. The relationships between several scenes in the Trinity manuscript and those in some of the late examples of the Spanish Beatus group are clearly shown by reproductions from the St. Sever manuscript (Paris, Bibl. Nat. lat. 8878; Manchester, John Rylands, Ms lat. 8; Paris, Bibl. Nat. Nouv. acq. lat. 2290). The scene of the sealing of the Twelve Tribes (Rev. 7:1-8), which is not found in any of the other Anglo- French Apocalypse manuscripts before 1260, would seem to be clearly dependent on the Beatus examples. (See also Freyhan, "Joachism," 234-35, and for a listing of the scenes appar- ently unique to Trinity, see James, Trinity, 20-22.) So, too, the beautiful illumination of the vision of the Heavenly Jerusalem, where the names of the Twelve Tribes of Israel are writ- ten over the gates and the names of some of the apostles are inscribed on the stones (fol. 25v), seems to be dependent on a Beatus model. Brieger rightly emphasizes the importance of these two illuminations, which reveal the in- terest of the compilers in the concordance of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 201 the Old and New Testaments. Other individual handlings, such as the special emphasis in cer- tain scenes on the redeeming blood of Christ or the Lamb (foll. 5 and 14) are described with great sensitivity. The Berengaudus commentary used in con- densed form by the compilers is now believed to have originated nearer to the twelfth cen- tury; thus what was thought to be a pecu- liarly "conservative" aspect of this and other Anglo-French apocalypse manuscripts seems no longer so. M. R. James and Paul Meyer both noted that the Trinity commentary was an abridgment of the Berengaudus gloss, not known by them to exist elsewhere (James, Trinity Apocalypse, especially 16 and 23; Leopold Delisle and Paul Meyer, L'Apocalypse en fran- qais au XIIIe siecle, Paris, 1901, cxxvii-ix, ccliii). However, in Brieger's further discussion of the date of this version of the Berengaudus com- mentary, he confusedly uses the evidence for the dating of that found in another of the Anglo-French Apocalypse manuscripts, Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403, one which has a quite differ- ent French prose commentary. Then, to add to the confusion, Brieger incorrectly states that Meyer thought that "the Trinity commentary ... was written in the first half of the thir- teenth century, possibly by a Franciscan as part of the new effort of the Order to re-es- tablish the unity of faith by an attack on the heretics and by the reform of the clergy." He uses as his source for Meyer's opinion an arti- cle by J. C. Fox ("The Earliest French Apoc- alypse and Commentary," Modern Language Review, 7, 1912, 445-468. See especially pp. 446 and 468.). However, Fox's article was also dealing with the commentary found in Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403, and contains no mention whatsoever of the Trinity Berengaudus com- mentary or of Meyer's opinions about it. The evidence for dating the Paris commentary is only indirectly relevant to the dating of that in the Trinity manuscript. In his discussion of style Brieger follows Freyhan in identifying a peculiarly hieratic and archaic quality which may be influenced in part by its dependence on earlier models (Frey- han, "Joachism," 234-35). Beyond this, Brie- ger is content to summarize briefly the subtly different qualities of what are believed to be the four hands who worked on the manuscript, and to indicate in a most general way that there is a relationship to the style "of St. Albans at the time of Matthew Paris," of "French illuminations of the 1240's," and of the Westminster Psalter (London, B. M. Roy 2.A.XXII). Since he discusses the visual sources fairly extensively, one is surprised that the stylistic relationships are not dealt with in equal depth. It could be argued that this aspect has been treated in other studies of English medieval painting. However, none of the other manuscripts which are felt to come from the same milieu as the Trinity manuscript is even mentioned in footnotes, i.e., the Lives of the Offas, London, Brit. Mus. Cotton Ms Nero D.1; Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403; and The Life of St. Edward, Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Ms Ee.iii.59. There is also no mention of the Eve- sham Psalter and D. H. Turner's recent study of it (]Warb 27, 1964, 23-41). Mr. Turner es- tablished a valid stylistic relationship between the Trinity Apocalypse and the Evesham Psalter, and, combining stylistic and documen- tary data, suggests a date of ca. 1245-1250 for the former. Brieger apparently agrees with this as he states that for stylistic reasons the manuscript cannot be later than 1250. Though a good select bibliography is given at the end of the introductory essay, it might have been useful to give brief footnotes summarizing the various opinions on particular problems such as style, dating, and provenance, as opinions have varied among scholars in recent years. (For example, on the date, M. R. James very cautiously estimated 1230-1250, Trinity, 24. Miss Rickert, in the first edition of her Paint- ing in Britain, The Middle Ages, Baltimore, 1954, calls the Trinity Apocalypse "the parent of them all," p. 120. In the second edition, 1965, p. 111, she largely follows Freyhan in seeing it as derived from his Group I, and dates Trinity between ca. 1246 and 1258[?].) Brieger has selected 1242 as the earliest prob- able date because the fear of Antichrist's com- ing, stimulated by Joachist prophecies, became more specific with the ravages of the Tartars in 1242, and because the angels of the Euphrates on folio 10 are shown with dark vicious faces, or as "angels of darkness." However, Profes- sor Wormald has pointed out that English illuminations sometimes depicted the wicked with dark and ugly faces from as early as the middle of the twelfth century ("Trinity's Apoc- alypse," review in The Times Literary Sup- plement, May 25, 1967, 476). There is no doubt that the popularity of the illustrated Apoc- alypse manuscripts was related in part to fear of the coming of the end of the world. However, the literal interpretation of the preaching and killing of the witnesses found in Trinity (foll. 11v and 12r), places less em- phasis on the expected coming of the Anti- christ than the illuminations in New York, Morgan Ms 524, pp. 12-14; Oxford, Bodl. Auct. D.4.17, foll. 8v-9v; and Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403, foll. 17r-18r, where "the beast" of Rev. 11: 7 is shown as an elegant human ruler, Antichrist, and where there are interpolated scenes concerning his life. Brieger's earlier reference to the illustrations of Antichrist as a man in the Beatus manuscripts (pp. 8-9) indi- cates that Antichrist expectations had long been associated with the text of John's Revela- tion. The presence of Franciscans in a number of scenes suggests their obvious influence. Fran- ciscans first came to England in 1224. The friars were at "the pitch of their first enthusiasm" in the years 1240 to 1270 (David Knowles, The Religious Houses of Medieval England, Lon- don, 1940, 55). Unless more specific evidence is found, dating on the basis of stylistic rela- tionships to datable manuscripts, allowing for certain overlaps in style, would seem to be surer than the other reasons proposed by Brie- ger. In M. R. James's publications on English Apocalypse manuscripts, that erudite and tire- less man usually included a discussion of what was known to date about the numerous extant examples and the relationships among them. These studies were summarized in his Schweich lectures of 1927, published in his book, The Apocalypse in Art, London, 1931. (See also The Apocalypse in Latin and French, Bodleian Ms Douce 180, Oxford, 1923; The Apocalypse in Latin, Ms. 10 in the Collection of Dyson Perrins, F.S.A., Oxford, 1927; and The Dublin Apocalypse, Cambridge, 1932. His numerous catalogue descriptions are listed in The Apoc- alypse in Art.) His material was sometimes repetitive but always there was some new in- formation or a new insight. James built on the pioneering work of Leopold Delisle and Paul Meyer, using their system of numbering the manuscripts and following their broad di- vision of two "families," though the second of these, which kept expanding as more manu- scripts were located, was increasingly divided into subgroups, and James indicated that such were the subdivisions and cross-divisions among them that it seemed impossible "to draw up a pedigree such as can be constructed for a classical text" (Apocalypse in Art, 45). By 1931 James could list seventy-two manuscripts with pictorial Apocalypse cycles which, with a few exceptions, seemed to belong to the</page><page sequence="4">202 The Art Bulletin Anglo-French group, plus twenty more exam- ples in other media or variant manuscript cycles. These are in addition to the early Carolingian and Ottonian examples and the Spanish Beatus examples. Nonetheless, James carefully and conscientiously listed as many precise relationships among these as he could, thus attempting, as far as possible, to place each manuscript in context. All subsequent scholars are able to build on the extraordinary efforts of Delisle, Meyer, and James. Dr. Frey- han, in a study focusing on the possible in- fluence of Joachism on the inception and de- velopment of Anglo-French Apocalypses, included a series of short but very penetrating analyses of particular problems. One may dis- agree with some of his conclusions, and some of his terminology is confusing, but many of his insights cannot be ignored. He worked out a series of phases of development, trying to identify various subgroups within each phase ("Joachism," 218). Brieger makes little or no mention of the problem of classification, or of the problem of the relationship of the Trinity manuscript to other Anglo-French Apocalypse manuscripts of about the same date. These problems are complex, but now that the initial task of assembling the data has been done, one wishes for more detailed studies of in- dividual manuscripts or of small groups. An attempt to relate the Trinity Apocalypse to others of the early or "first generation" of Anglo-French Apocalypse manuscripts might have been useful. Throughout his text, Brieger assumes or im- plies that the Trinity volume "set a new fash- ion," or "ushers in a new phase" of interpre- tation of St. John's Revelation; he does not provide evidence to support this assumption, but states: "Its numerous English companions such as the Paris Apocalypse (Paris, Bibl. Nat. fr.403) are later and partly dependent on it" (p. 5). James, on the other hand, concluded that Trinity occupied "a place apart" (p. 16). He noted that the text did not coincide with any other; that the episodes from the life of St. John, which are placed at the beginning and end of the Apocalypse cycle, were more exten- sive, but the illustrations to the text fewer; that often episodes which in other manuscripts occupy two or three separate pictures were condensed into single scenes in Trinity, though it "hardly ever" followed the converse course of expansion (p. 16). It also seemed to him to "stand alone" or almost alone in the singularity of a few of its compositions, and in the large format and unusual variations in the size of the miniatures. Freyhan saw it as individual in handling but derivative of his Group I, i.e., a group described by Millar, and a major group within the old "second family" (p. 219). Brieger appropriately spends some time describing and discussing certain scenes which appear to be unique to Trinity, and which reveal especially imaginative interpretation of the text. However, no reference is made to those scenes omitted by the Trinity artists and usually included in other related manuscripts, or to those scenes handled with greater simplicity-i.e., in the other related manuscripts the Four Horsemen are shown in four clearly differentiated types of clothing, while in Trinity they are almost monotonously the same. Thus Brieger's de- scription tends towards eulogy, while James presented a more balanced and detailed evalu- ation. If one attempts to test Brieger's implied hy- pothesis that Trinity was the first of the new type of Anglo-French Apocalypse manuscript, and thus, presumably, the most important model, the "key monument," the evidence is not totally convincing. The problem is too com- plex to discuss in detail here, but if one makes careful scene-by-scene comparisons of the Apoc- alypse cycles (excluding scenes from the Life of St. John) among those Anglo-French Apoc- alypse manuscripts that can with good reason be dated before 1260, and then traces these cycles in manuscripts executed in later phases of development, one finds that two pairs of manuscripts have cycles that were most in- fluential as "models." The first cycle is found in New York, Morgan Ms 524 and its sister manuscript, Oxford, Bodl. Auct. D.4.17, and the second cycle is in London, Lambeth Palace, Ms 209 and its sister manuscript, that formerly in Metz, Bibl. de la Ville, Ms Salis. 38 (de- stroyed in World War II, but a complete set of photographs are available for study in the British Museum). The influence of the first pair as models is well known; that of the second pair is perhaps not known or all too often over- looked. Although the episodes in the two cycles are always very similar, the details of the episodes are nonetheless consistently differ- ent. Again, perhaps one should hypothesize that originally there were written instructions or models available to several artists. In the case of both of these two influential cycles, one can find "progeny" in which the models were copied with only the slightest modifica- tion into the fifteenth century. The cycle found in Trinity seems parallel to or dependent on the latter pair, though often the handling is individual. (Both James and Freyhan noted that the Trinity cycle seemed to be "dependent.") Brieger's footnote statement that Dr. Freyhan's archetype "represents a corrected version of the Trinity Apocalypse made at a Benedictine centre inimical to the new orders" is hard to accept without supporting evidence--especially when no cognizance is given to the differences between the New York-Oxford cycle and the Metz-Lambeth cycle, or to the fact that Trinity has so many affinities with the latter. This is not to say that the cycle as found in Trinity had no influence whatsoever; but the implica- ation that the Trinity Apocalypse is the most important model for the entire group over- simplifies and, in the end, confuses. The question of which of the extant Anglo- French Apocalypses is earliest from the point of view of style is different from the question of which one, or ones, ushered in a "new phase in the interpretation and illustration of this last book of the Bible." Its oddly archaic han- dling, heavy outlines, and almost Romanesque definition of modeled areas, as opposed to the softer modeling and lighter linear definition found in some of the manuscripts, suggest that Trinity may indeed be one of the earliest. By the same token, the Paris manuscript also seems early. The peculiarly deviant qualities of the picture cycles found in these two manu- scripts suggest that, though having access to the sources used by the creators of this "new phase" in Apocalypse illustration, their com- pilers were not necessarily the originators, and were certainly not alone in fostering the new phase. Several lesser points and minor errors call for comment: In note 2, page 1, Brieger states: "The close relationship which exists between the Trinity College Apocalypse and the Bible Moralisbe has never been studied. I believe that the Bible Moralisee follows our manuscript." The latter is available for study in the great facsimile edi- tion edited by A. de Laborde (ttude sur la Bible Moralisee illustree, 5 vols., Paris, 1911- 1927). After an attempt at a scene-by-scene comparison, I can but agree with Dr. Freyhan, who wrote that "the few points of similarity . . . are either superficial or non-existent" ("Joachism," n. 4, 224-25). There is no doubt a general relationship, in that some of the same historical conditions, such as religious enthusiasm, that stimulated the production of</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 203 one type of manuscript also fostered that of the other, but to say that the moralized Bibles "follow our manuscript" is to strain the point. On page 9 and again on page 12, Brieger in- dicates that the "beast" which kills the wit- nesses (Rev. 11:7), illustrated on folio 12r, combines the features of the human Antichrist as found in the Beatus manuscripts and the an- imal illustrated in Trier Ms 31 and related manuscripts. Instead, this curious beast, with its human face and horse's body, is a quite literal rendering of the description of locust beasts in Rev. 9:3-11. This same use of the description of the locust beasts for the beast of Rev. 11:7 is found in the Liber Floridus manu- scripts (and is illustrated in figures 7 and 8 of Brieger's text) and in all of the manuscripts with the "second" Apocalyptic cycle. A true conflation of this bestial image and Antichrist as a man is found in the manuscript formerly belonging to Dyson Perrins, folio 17r, where a clearly anthropomorphic hoofed and hairy- legged creature, wearing a coat of mail, bends down to kill the witnesses. The Eugrammia Press and those whose serv- ices they commanded (carefully listed on the inside of the back cover) have provided a su- perb tool for scholarship in this complete fac- simile of the Trinity Apocalypse, to which the transcription and translation of the text by Miss Dulong are invaluable additions. The in- troduction is not the carefully documented critical commentary that one might expect to accompany volumes otherwise so carefully pre- pared, and in many cases scholars will need to use M. R. James's earlier study. The profits from the sale of these two volumes are to be used for the Restoration Fund of the Wren Li- brary in Cambridge, an admirable example of generosity on the part of the publishers.
