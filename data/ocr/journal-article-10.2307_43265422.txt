<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEW THE EMERGING LAW OF WILDLIFE: A NARRATIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY George Cameron Coggins* Deborah Lyndall Smith** Properly speaking, there is no "law of wildlife" in the sense that there is property law or tax law. There is no one set of anno- tated statutes, no comprehensive body of case law, no treatise, and no court of special jurisdiction devoted exclusively to the legal rules governing relationships with animals ferae naturae. Nonethe- less, there is in the United States, a discernable and growing trend toward rationalization and development of the law surrounding wildlife. In common with other areas of environmental law, there is emerging a special focus on legal protection of wildlife per se as a valuable natural resource.1 To these observers, it seems irrelevant whether or not attor- neys are inclined to assign any priority to the creation of a law of wildlife,2 because the course of that law will be determined by interest of the general citizenry.

It is misleading in that domestic animals will occasionally be mentioned, and in the fact that forms of life not usually thought of as wildlife, such as insects, are meant to be included. With some reservations, by "wildlife" as used herein is meant all forms of life that are not human, microscopic, plants, nor for the most part domesticated, thus including mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and insects. Cf. 16 U.S.C. § 1532(5) (1974). 2. While there is no reliable guide to the feelings of practicing attorneys on this subject, recent literature indicates that legal scholars are at least upgrading the priority of wildlife considerations in the scheme of things. A recent issue of Environmental Affairs , for example, was largely devoted to wildlife law. The "Spe- cial Section on Law and Animals" included Burr, Toward Legal Rights for Animals, 4 Envir. Aff. 205 (1975); Palmer, Endangered Species Protection: A History of Congressional Action , 4 Envir.

Inconclusive but persuasive evidence of this phenomenon is the fact that Cleveland Amory's sarcastic anti-hunting book, C. Amory, Man Kind? Our Incredible War on Wildlife (1974) has been a nationwide bestseller. Not only are there more societies devoted to animal welfare, and an increasing number of statutes enacted,3 but there is also a definite trend to litigation aimed at protection of wildlife. Recently federal courts have handed down decisions holding that: a wildlife refuge may be protected against intrusion by humans by cutting off property owners' access to their property;4 regulation of off-road vehicles on public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management must do more to protect wildlife habitat;5 protection of the Indiana Bat under the Endangered Species Act of 19736 was not sufficient reason to enjoin the Merremac Dam;7 and allegations of purported violations of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act8 and the Migratory Bird Act9 by the Department of the Interior did not, for various reasons, state valid claims for relief.10 While wildlife spokesmen initially lost two of these four suits, as well as the notorious blackbird annihilation litigation,11 the real point is that these suits were brought and fought. It is suggested that, in common with other areas of environ- mental law, recent developments, including these suits and others like them,12 are but the forerunners of a new field. A few recent articles have begun the process of synthesizing the various enactments and decisions into something resembling a body of law. Perhaps the most significant impetus toward legal development was the publication in 197313 of a collection of all 3. Some of those statutes at the federal level are listed in the text § III, D , infra. 4. Coupland v. Morton, 7 ERC 2127 (4th Cir. 1975). 5. National Wildlife Federation v. Morton, 393 F.

That work, labori- ously entitled A Compilation of Federal Laws Relating to Conservation and Development of our Nation's Fish and Wildlife Re- sources, Environmental Quality, and Oceanography Stock No. 5270-01993 (1973). has recently been out of print, but is invaluable as a resource tool with which to probe the labyrinth. Two writers have attempted overviews of sorts, and others have treated a few broader problems in a broader context. The Compilation was the starting point for the only comprehensive work on federal wildlife law: Guilbert, Wildlife Preservation Under Federal Law , in Federal Environmental Law 550-94 (E. Dolgin &amp; T. Guilbert eds. 1974). Guilberťs 44 page survey is necessarily somewhat shallow since its breadth is potentially enormous, but it is at this writing the best overall treatment of federal law as well as the only one of its kind. Guilbert surveyed and to some extent analyzed laws providing for habitat acquisition and other indirect protections in addition to those few statutes dealing with wildlife directly. The only other legal writing of general applicability is James Dickens' 1973 arti- cle, Dickens, The Law and Endangered Species of Wildlife , 9 Gonzaga L. Rev. 57 (1973). The title is slightly misleading: Dickens attempted a commentary on law beyond statutes protecting endangered species at the state, federal, and international levels. His collection of biological refer- ences is one of the more comprehensive in the legal literature, and, curiously, his compilation of state statutes on some aspects of hunting laws appears to be the only such survey in law reviews during the past century. It should be noted that Dickens' pioneer- ing work is not wholly devoid of passion or ideology, but then no person should be a moral cipher. While far broader in scope than nearly all legal literature pertaining to wildlife, Dickens' article analyzes one particular facet of the law without attempting to fit that facet into a larger whole.14 14. Other works that include sections on wildlife law of attempted generality</page><page sequence="4">586 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 That larger whole has yet to be attempted or accomplished. Commentators have dwelt on subjects as seemingly dissimilar as Roman property law, medieval criminal trials of animals, hunting rights in the King's preserves, treaties to regulate the allowable killing of whales, recent statutes aimed at the protection of certain species, and many other such topics, without perceiving a common theme or subject matter. This bibliographical article will attempt to collect and cite the items in that voluminous but disparate literature, to categorize it in accordance with a comprehensive and perhaps arbitrary outline, and thus hopefully to accelerate the trend toward the development of a discrete law of wildlife qua wildlife. This bibliographical survey does not purport to be exhaus- tive. In the areas chosen, which by no means represent all relevant areas, only a representative sample of the available scholarly works are included, although for some topics the only items located were necessarily cited regardless of interest or quality. The organization utilized is comprised of four main headings: The History and Philosophy of Wildlife Law; The State Law of Wildlife; The Federal Law of Wildlife; and The International Law of Wildlife. These general categories were selected on the basis of convenience of reference; it is not pretended that they are truly exclusive, wholly comprehensive, or the final word on an ordered scheme of categorization. Under History and Philosophy will be listed the discussions of the légal attitudes of different cultures through history toward various species of animals. The section will be divided generally into Ancient Law, Medieval and Common Law, and Pre-1900 American Law. "Philosophical," as used in this context, is merely a convenient label for the literature espousing particular views toward wildlife and the values it represents in at least a quasi-legal context. Wildlife law, management, and regula- tion in this country traditionally has been a state prerogative, but the literature on state law is strangely sparse and incomplete. The literature on federal law is perhaps the most important because the federal government is assuming an increasing stewardship over this resource, just as it has over many other aspects of environmen- tal quality. Included in this section will be articles, cases, and statutes on wildlife policy on federal lands, habitat protection, trade policy, endangered and threatened species, particular pro- are Endangered Wildlife in A. Reitze, Environmental Planning: Law Of Land &amp; Resources ch. 10, at 1-42 (1974); O. Gray, Environmental Law: Cases &amp; Materials 251-301 (2d ed. 1973).</page><page sequence="5">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 587 tective measures, and a variety of other related topics. The section on International Law will be limited to a few aspects of that diffuse field that relate fairly directly to the obligations of the United States toward wildlife in the bi-lateral or multilateral sphere. Wildlife law, like environmental law as a whole is of poten- tially limitless scope due to its newness and lack of definition. For instance, is the scope of a 1920 pipeline right-of-way statute pro- perly within the province of the law of wildlife? Of course the two seem unrelated; but, on the other hand, the Alaska Pipeline will divide the range of the caribù and possibly disrupt their habitat.15 The reader will realize that any body of law must necessarily be finite in order1 to be comprehensible. The compiler must at some point arbitrarily impose limits on his subject matter to keep it manageable. The limits selected for our purposes are these: 1. The literature on Indian law is voluminous, and necessar- ily includes much related to Indian hunting and fishing rights, but that literature will be ignored except for the best of the genre: F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law (1942) and Hobbs, Indian Hunting and Fishing Rights II, 37 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1251 (1969). 2. Legal writings on the law of the sea generally and the law of fisheries specifically are even more voluminous; only those arti- cles dealing with marine mammals, endangered species, and a few on international fisheries law will be cited. 3. Many species of wildlife are dependent upon federal lands for habitat or in some cases exist only on it. Law pertaining to the public domain is extensive and difficult, and rarely deals directly with wildlife except as one of the many considerations involved in public land-use planning. Although protection and improvement of habitat is the primary concern to any species, articles on federal lands will be included hereinafter only when their discussions seem pertinent to an included topic. 4. Perhaps the most potent legal weapon of wildlife partisans in combatting large-scale developments harmful to wildlife is the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 16 but the bulk of the commentary and litigation spawned thereunder is of merely tan- 15.

Except for a few pertinent pieces at appropriate places in this outline, citations to NEPA literature must be sought independently. 5. Finally, no effort will be made to include more than a small cross-section of the biological, zoological or ornithological literature, either generally or by species. The articles that are cited frequently contain references to such works, and several relevant periodicals will be mentioned. I. The History and Philosophy of Wildlife Law In this era of self-proclaimed albeit dubious enlightenment, passage of statutes for protection of wildlife and formation of socie- ties dedicated to similar ends might superficially indicate the be- ginning of legal concern about wildlife. In fact, however, laws af- fecting wildlife are at least as ancient as civilization. Available materials indicate that although such laws were fragmented, vary- ing, inconsistent, and confusing, nevertheless they operated throughout history. Over the centuries, there have evolved three main areas of traditional legal concern more or less static and clearly discerna- ble: a concept of property in wildlife; theories of torts committed by or upon animals; and a catchall perhaps best described as "offi- cial cultural prejudices." First, all wild or domesticated lesser or- ders, frequently including slaves, in all civilized times have been regarded as a form of property, to which specific rules of law ap- plied. The law of property in wildlife primarily revolved around the question of which person or entity could legally do what to which species or specimen. One consequence is that generations of law students have been introduced to property law by the bemusing Pierson u. Post 17 question of who owns "one of the noxious beasts called a fox?" Man's traditional concept of things has not allowed his generic self to consider any alternative to the notion that all things must be owned in some sense by some person. The forest laws of medieval England are replete with suchi nice distinctions as those between the rights of a bishop versus the rights of the second son of a nobleman in forms of game, and the game itself was legally classified in complicated ways according to assumed characteristics of various species. Such disputes frequently gave 17. 3 Cai. R. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1805).</page><page sequence="7">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 589 rise to significant controversies in the "olden days": that Robin Hood was a poacher is learned early in childhood; less well known is that grievances concerning hunting rights were a major cause of the events culminating in the signing of the Magna Carta, The second primary area of legal concern, following naturally from the property concepts, falls under the heading of tort law. That is, when an animal damages another person or another's property, what relationship between that animal and an individual justifies requiring the individual to pay for the loss? Old reports are filled with learned discussions of differing legal liability for acts of tigers and of rabbits, the majority of which appear to depend on somewhat unscientific findings as to the natural propensities of those species. From Hammurabi and the Bible to Andrews u. Andrews,1* all societies have tried to rationalize, sometimes plainly, sometimes tortuously, theories of human liability for acts of animals that are, as the Romans put it, res nullius , the property of no one. The third historically significant category is the most amor- phous and the least "legal" though in many ways the most fasci- nating, consisting of a pastiche of superstition, totemic taboo, ec- clesiastical ordinance, and, in the end, cultural prejudice. Thus, for example, the Jews were forbidden to eat most wildlife, Greeks cherished dolphins, Egyptians made killing a cat a capital offense, medieval Europeans tried and executed pigs and rats, and anyone asserting the positive attributes of wolves in 17th century Massa- chusetts would likely have been burned as a witch. The history of wildlife law has never been compiled into a separate analytical or philosophical work. The best available over- views, from opposite sides of the conceptual fence, are W. Sigler, Wildlife Law Enforcement ch. 1 (2d ed. 1972); and G. Carson, Men Beasts, and Gods: A History of Cruelty and Kindness to Animals (1974). Many particular facets have received the benefit of occasional or intensive legal commentary, from which the following selection of the literature on wildlife law history is drawn. The categories uti- lized are chronological and convenient.

The final category in this section, Early American Law, which meshes together with philosophies of wildlife, will serve as an introduction to present system in the United States. A. The Ancient Law of Wildlife By studying present primitive societies, anthropologists have given us a picture of man's perceptions of and relations with ani- mals before the dawn of recorded history. In general, it must be concluded that early man, innately aware of his ecological reliance on other species, regardecj those species with reverence as re- spected and frequently more powerful kin. See generally , Frazer, The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion 217-21, 518-32 (1925). Also informative and scarcely less exhaustive is N. Thomas, Animals , 1 Encyclopedia of Religion &amp; Ethics 483-535 (1951). The advent of history, and concomitantly of civilization, brought about new attitudes and rigid rules. Hammurabi codified certain tort aspects of animal stewardship; those laws are trans- lated and commented upon in The Babylonian Laws §§ 244-52 G. Driver &amp; J. Miles eds. (1955). Like the Babylonians, the Ancient Hebrews had a carefully delineated and largely retributive system of liability for injury done by and to animals. The student may refer directly to The Bible, especially Exodus 21:28-35. Dietary laws are prominent in the Judaic tradition, and illumine the prevalent attitudes toward animals. See Exodus 22:31; Leviticus 17:14, 20:25; Deuteronomy 14:3-21. Frazer, supra at 472, examines the theory that originally the notion of "unclean" was the notion of "sacred." Extraordinary solicitude for animal welfare is often cited as a distinctive feature, of Jewish ethics and law. Even the kosher rules for butchering animals are founded on sparing the beasts as much fear and pain as possible. Special Sabbath provisions were made for animals: they were included as beneficiaries of the Sabbath peace, but that peace could be disturbed to rescue an animal in distress. The pertinent Biblical laws are painstakingly compiled in</page><page sequence="9">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 591 Encyclopedia of The Jewish Religion 32, 115 R. Werblonsky &amp; G. Wigoder eds. (1966). For a more lengthy and expository treatment, see A. Cohen, Everyman's Talmud 235-37 (1949). Two good comparative analyses are Carson, supra , at chapter 2, in which the author attempts a general synthesis of Judaic and Catholic treatment of animals; and II B. Cohen, Jewish and Roman Law 233, 381-83, 581-91 (1966). The ancient Greeks' reverence and affection for animals is legendary. In that light, perhaps it is significant that for all the reams of folklore and myth there is a paucity of legal writing con- cerning animals. For mythological aspects, see A. Alpers, Dolphins: The Myth and the Mammal (1961) ; and H.J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology 155, 300 (1928). For a justly famous early zoological encyclopedia, see Aristotle, The History of Animals (R. Cresswell transi. 1862). One of the few illumined areas in ancient Greek treatment of ani- mals under law is also one of the more bizarre and is at first glance inconsistent with the otherwise gentle and graceful cast of classical thought regarding animals. Herodotus first noted that the Greeks solemnly prosecuted and executed animals and inanimate objects for their "crimes." This strange practice, which was to be contin- ued throughout the Middle Ages and even into the 19th century, was peculiar to Athens throughout ancient times. See Katz, Prosecution of Animals and Lifeless Things in Greek Law , 4 Lincoln L. Rev. 1 (1931). For an historical perspective, see Carson, supra , at 9-10, and Hyde, The Prosecution and Punishment of Animals and Life- less Things in The Middle Ages and Modern Times , 64 U. Pa. L. Rev. 696-700 (1916). The flavor of the difference between ancient Greek and Roman law is caught semantically in their different words for the same animal, beloved by the Greeks and eaten by the Romans: Dolphin</page><page sequence="10">592 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 comes from the Greek word for womb, suggested by its shape; Porpoise is derived from two Latin words and means pig-fish. See Reiger, Dolphin Sacred , Porpoise Profane , Audubon, Jan. 1975, at 2. The best known facet of the relationship between the Roman Empire and its sub-human subjects was the brutal arena of the gladitorial amphitheater. Gibbons notes that Commodus was sup- posed to have killed 100 lions with 100 arrows in one afternoon. I E. Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ch. IV, at 119 (J. Bury Ltd. ed. 1906). However, the notion of property rights in animals received its first exhaustive statutory treatment in the civil law of Rome. Obliter- ated by then, except for the superstitions of augery and omen, were all the pleasant, primeval beliefs in animals as somehow more closely attuned than man to the secret harmony of things. Animals were either owned by somebody or they were not, and if they were not, ownership in them could be acquired by occupatio. For ex- planation of the doctrine of res nullius occupanti cedit , see R. Sohm, The Institutes 304, 317 (3d ed. J. Ledie transi. 1907); and S. Amos, The History and Principles of the Civil Law of Rome 160-61 (1883). Another kind of animal property law in Roman law that was to preoccupy the ruling classes of the western world for centuries was the law of the chase. Killing certain kinds of wild beasts be- came a cherished privilege, eventually a royal prerogative. For relevent portions of the Justinian Code, which gave universal li- cense to kill lions, thus repealing the dangerous imperial preroga- tive in that respect, see , e.g. , XV The Civil Law 198 (S. Scott transi. 1932). As previously noted, the legal concept of tort with respect to animals is logically dependent upon the essential concept of prop- erty. For a discussion of Roman law governing acquisition of prop- erty in wild animals, the nature of that interest, and liability for the injury caused by an animal claimed as property, see The Civil Law supra , vol. I, at 112-18; vol. V at 176, 177. For general discussions of Roman theories of liability, which</page><page sequence="11">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 593 unfortunately presuppose a fairly intimate knowledge of the intri- cacies of Roman forms of action, see Ashton-Cross, Liability for Animals in Roman Law , 17 Camb. L. J. 189 (1959); Ashton-Cross, Liability in Roman Law for Damage Caused by Animals, 11 Camb. L. J. 395 (1953); and The Roman Law Relating to Damage Done by Animals , 22 S. Afr. L. J. 290 (1905). With the fall of Rome and Europe's consequent descent into ecclesiastical darkness came a return of some of the earlier atti- tudes of superstition and uneasy anthropomorphism. The ancient Athenian custom of holding animals criminally responsible for in- jury to persons or property was revived in the Middle Ages, accom- modating itself to the doctrines of the Church. The fascination that this area of legal history held for scholars at the turn of this century is demonstrated by the abundance of available articles, most of which are smugly and superciliously amused by the barba- rism and novelty of the practice. The best works are Hyde, The Prosecution and Punishment of Animals and Life- less Things in the Middle Ages and Modern Times , 64 U.Pa.L.Rev. 696 (1916); and Evans, Bugs and Beasts Before the Law , 11 Green Bag 33 (1899). A handful of other articles, less authoritative and more or less redundant, include: Kerr, Animals in Court , 113 Law Times 204 (1902); Browne, Animals as Offenders and as Victims , 21 Albany L. J. 265 (1880); and Prosecutions Against Animals, 14 Crim. L. Mag. 709 (1893). At the same time that these authors were inferentially congratulat- ing themselves for their modern, civilized perception, many species of beast and bird were being exterminated from the face of the earth by ruthless and unnecessary commercial hunting; perhaps therein lies a moral lesson for our age. For discussion of the peripheral matter of animals as witnesses in court, see Tarisse, Animals as Witnesses in Court, 81 Cent. L.J. 335 (1915); and Bell, Animals as Witnesses, 6 Lawyer &amp; Banker 32 (1913).</page><page sequence="12">594 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 The laws regarding game, the chase, and the forests became a prime legal concern in medieval Europe v particularly in England. The exclusive right of the sovereign to hunt in certain areas was such an important prerogative to the Norman kings that much of farmed Saxon England reverted to forest by royal order. Where once the people had lived by the Roman legal idea that wild game belonged to no one in its wild state and subsequently belonged to the person who killed it, suddenly all the deer belonged to the king. Hunting for food was poaching, a crime early made punishable by death; later, in more enlightened reigns, offenders were subject only to castration and banishment. Small wonder that Robin Hood and his merrie men steered clear of the Sheriff of Nottingham. On that peripheral topic, see The Prince of Poachers, Symposium on Game Laws , 18 Case &amp; Com. 235 (1911). The classic treatise on the forest laws is a 16th century English work, J. Manwood, A Treatise and Discourse of the Lawes of the Forrest: Wherein Is Declared Not Only Those Lawes, As They Are Now in Force, But Also the Originall and Begin- ning of Forrestes (1598). A somewhat later but equally indispensable work is: W. Nelson, The Laws of England Concerning Game of Hunting, Hawking, Fishing, and Fowling (2d ed. 1732). See also : E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England, Containing the Exposition of Many Ancient and Other Statutes (1797); and J. Chitty, Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book 4, at 174-75 (1827). Chitty had his own thoughts on the old game laws, not always consistent with Blackstone. Cf. J. Chitty, A Treatise on the Game Laws and on Fisheries (1812). A more contemporary account may be found at: Murphy, The Lawyer as Historian : Magna Carta and Public Rights of Fishery, 1963 Ir. Jur. 131.</page><page sequence="13">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 595 B. Later Development of Wildlife Law Although American law incorporated much English common law in terms of tort, property, and cruelty concepts and developed those concepts parallel with the law of the mother country, the Colonists rejected in toto the sovereign prerogative in the forest and its game.19 Many had been impelled to migrate as a result of resentment against the oppressive game laws, and their new, wild land had seemingly unlimited numbers of edible beasts. Fre- quently one of the first official acts of the new settlements was the granting to themselves the rights they had lost in 1066. See : W. Sigler, Wildlife Law Enforcement 1-16 (2d ed. 1972); Gabrielson, Wildlife Management 57 (1951); Norwood, The Colony Ordinance of 1641-47 and Its Effect on Maine Law , 3 Peabody L. Rev. 77 (1939); and Game and Fish Preservation : An Eighteenth Century Viewpoint , 124 Just. P. 702 (1960). The two former sources trace the growth of the American version of game laws, as do also Carson, supra , at ch. 7, and Swan, A History of Game Legislation in the United States , 18 Case &amp; Com. 235, 248 (1911). Ironically, the democratic spirit as applied to hunting was eventually disastrous to the sport itself. While the tyranny of the forest laws had at least preserved the animals, the anti-regulation mentality in early nineteenth century America was responsible for the extinction of many species* and the severe depletion of the populations of many more. The colonies, and later the states, were slow to adopt any kind of restrictive ordinances. See generally Gabrielson, supra , at 56-75; and P. Matthiessen, Wildlife in America (1959). As the formidable body of the English common law developed, so did the notions of property and tort law applicable to animals. The definitive analyses are found in Blackstone (Chitty's ver- sion), supra , Book II at 5, 292-297, 391, 411-420; Book III at 154; 19. It might be more accurate as well as more fastidious to say that the prerog- ative was not rejected so much as transferred, at first only in theory, and later in fact, to the sovereign people as a whole in the person or entity of the state. Eventu- ally it came to be accepted that "title" to wildlife rested in the state in trust, more or less, for the people.</page><page sequence="14">596 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 Book IV at 235-245. A few of the articles that attempt to trace and delineate the law of property in animals are Acquisition of Ownership in Wild Animals , 75 S. Afr. L.J. 369 (1958); Hogan, The Distraint of Animals Ferae Naturae , 34 Oré. L. Rev. 217 (1955); and Arnold, Law of Possession Governing the Acquisition of Ani- mals Ferae Naturae , 55 Am. L. Rev. 393 (1921). For a delightful tongue-in-cheek investigation of the who-owns- the-fox question, see Alderman, Property in Wild Animals Escaping From Captivity , 21 Law Notes 24 (1917). The emphasis in this century has shifted from definition of private rights to intergovernmental conflict over rights to own and regulate wildlife, a topic to be explored in connection with federal law, infra. Relevant at this point are Public Ownership of Wild Animals , 7 Bost. U.L. Rev. 137 (1927); Note, Public Fishing Rights , 12 Wyo. L.J. 167 (1958). One of the difficulties with Anglo-American tort law as it per- tains to animals has been the failure to distinguish between liabil- ity for dangerous domestic animals and animals ferae naturae , much less among categories of wild animals. For illustration of the consequent legal confusion see : . Bevan, The Responsibility at Common Law for the Keeping of Animals, 22 Harv. L. Rev. 465 (1909); and Note, "Escape" Doctrine as Limitation on Strict Liability , 6 Mercer L. Rev. 349 (1955). Other articles illustrating or analyzing historical notions of tort liability vis-a-vis animals include: Mcintosh, Theory of Responsibility for Injury by Wild Animals , 35 Law Notes 44 (1931); Browne, Animals Running at Large , 8 Green Bag 471 (1896); Ewell, Liability of Owner in Keeping Ferocious Animals (Annotated Case), 24 Am.

Law Reg. 613 (1879).</page><page sequence="15">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 597 In the early nineteenth century, the widespread and conspicu- ous abuse of domestic animals in England particularly horses pressed into urban service resurrected an ancient idea and gave birth to a new cause: that animals had a right to decent treatment and that cruelty to animals should be punished as a crime. For assorted views of the subject, see : E.S. Lea Vitt, Animals and Their Legal Rights (2d ed. 1970); Friend, Animal Cruelty Laws: The Case for Reform , 8 U. Richmond L.

That such early protective enactments were more hortatory than binding was poignantly noted, contemporaneously, by our spirit- ual predecessor Ernest Jelf in Jelf, Where to Find Your Law (Relating to Brute Animals), 103 Law Times 331 (1896). One of the most readable and comprehensive accounts of the anti- cruelty movement as well as an examination of the dichotomy between humane-society and Audubon Society ideologies, is found in Carson, supra . Cleveland Amory's invective in Man Kind?, supra is also instructive as well as provocative. A good historical perspective was recently published as Burr, Toward Legal Rights for Animals , 4 Envir. Aff. 205 (1975). A perusal of those articles on cruelty will suggest that the legal strictures surrounding treatment of domestic and wild animals is closely related to the philosophical perception of the community as a whole toward the lesser orders. Judaic and Roman law shifted that perception from one in which beasts were regarded as co-equal fellow travelers on the planet to one where the command of Genesis for man to have dominion "over every living thing that moves" predominated. In the sixteenth century, Leonardo daVinci com- mented that man would not be truly civilized until the killing of animals was regarded as murder; three centuries later Darwin ob- served that, in man's moral development, the lower animals were</page><page sequence="16">598 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 still the last to be accorded the benefit of his sympathies; and in this decade, several nations remain willing to extirpate the last remnants of the largest creature on earth, the blue whale, for the sake of a greater margin on their national profit-and-loss state- ments. The irreconcilable debate over whether humanity should be accorded to non-humans continues unabated, and is reflected in the legal, as well as popular, literature. That conflict today takes various forms, most notably between those who advocate "management" philosophies versus those who are in favor of a "preservationist" approach. Although there are many gradients of severity and meaning between those polar posi- tions, management-oriented biologists tend to believe that wild- life, or at least its more valuable forms, is a renewable resource, the killing of which is ecologically consistent in addition to being pleasurable and tending to stimulate the GNP. Opinions reflecting this general attitude may be seen in the archives and publications of state fish and game departments, the Department of the Inte- rior, and the Wildlife Management Institute. The latter organiza- tion is a sponsor of the annual conference from which derives a basic resource for wildlife law researchers, the annual Transactions of the North American Wildlife Conference. Similar resources include L. Wing, Practice of Wildlife Conservation (1951); D. Allen, Our Wildlife Legacy (rev. ed. 1962); and National Wildlife. Allen's book is the classic exposition of wildlife ecology from a management perspective. While he is scornful of many ill-advised efforts at predator control, he unfortunately omits detailed men- tion of the problems of non-game species, particularly those now considered endangered. The final reference is to a publication of the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation organization less conservative politically than such entities as the National Rifle Association, but still basically a hunting-and fishing-oriented so- ciety. Managers concentrate their attention on game species, while preservationists appear primarily concerned with a broader spec- trum of wildlife. Humane societies, Friendsof Animals, Inc., and similar organizations frequently appear adamently opposed to any killing under any circumstances. See , e.g., Herrington &amp; Regenstein, The Plight of Ocean Mammals , 1 Envir. Aff. 792 (1972).</page><page sequence="17">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 599 Less inflexible are the better-known conservation groups, such as the Audubon Society and the Sierra Club, whose philosophies are reflected in their respective excellent periodicals: Audubon; and Sierra Club Bulletin. See also Matthiessen, supra , and S. Simon &amp; P. Geroudet, Last Survivors: The Natural His- tory of Animals in Danger of Extinction (1970). In the fragmentary legal literature relevant to this theme, the two vaguely-defined sides seldom directly confront the main question. On the one hand are the "cruelty" pieces, represented by Burr, supra , and Friend, supra and related articles evidencing a perhaps emotional attachment to the concept of wildlife as embodied in Dicken's, supra, and Herrington &amp; Regenstein, supra . On the other hand, many articles on some facet of wildlife law attempt to make a case for relatively unfettered human domination in some circum- stances, e.g.. Murphy, Right to Kill Protected Animals in Defense of Property , 11 Okla. S.B.J. 1322 (1960); Note, Right to Kill Wild Animals in Defense of Person or Property , 31 Mont. L. Rev. 235 (1970); and Quinlan, Have Animals Rights? 38 Cent. L.J. 160 (1894); and others blithely assume that conclusion, e.g., Nishi, Voluntary Abstention Principle and Japan : Some Legal and Political Implications, 11 Nat. Res. J. 657 (1971). The same themes evident in an examination of wildlife history extend to the present day. State law in the United States tends to reflect the traditional concerns, while the federal government is largely responsible for innovation and new developments. II. The State Law of Wildlife The traditional concerns of wildlife law, concepts of property and tort, continue to be important in present state law, although as total wildlife habitat diminishes as a direct result of increasing urbanization, questions of who owns it or who has to pay for it diminish correspondingly in importance. Of increasing importance is state regulation of hunting and fishing, particularly in conjunc- tion with federal habitat, financing, and preservation programs.</page><page sequence="18">600 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 Tension between hunters and preservationists, between the state agency and various citizens groups, between state and federal gov- ernments, and between all those and commercial or exploitive in- terests is endemic and epidemic. The literature regarding the genesis of basic tort and property concepts was listed in the previous section, but a few other articles of that nature, usually premised on some unlikely but litigated occurrence, should be mentioned. Perhaps the best known is the case òf Andrews v. Andrews ,20 noted at, inter alia : Defendant's Intentional Attraction to His Land of Wild Geese that Destroyed Plaintiff's Crops Supports Action for Private Nuisance , 104 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1004 (1954); Liability for Degradations of Animals Ferae Naturae Purposely Attracted to the Land , 1956 Wash. U.L.Q, 381 (1956); and Maintenance of Pond to Attract Migratory Birds , 21 Mo. L. Rev. 316 (1956). Similar treatments of wildlife torts are: Murphy, Animals at Large on the Highway , 10 Mont. L. Rev. .09 (1949); Note, Offenses and Quasi-offenses - Absolute Liability - Inju- ries Caused by Noxious Animals , 34 Tul. L. Rev. 843 (1960); Fair, Personal Injuries by Animals in Texas , 4 Baylor L. Rev Rev. 183 (1952); and Note, Liability for Injuries by Vicious Bees , 54 Wash. L. Rep. 225 (1926). For property law wrinkles, see also Shaw, Rights in "Wild Animals " Farmed for Fur, 8 Bost. U.L. Rev. 74 (1928); and Alderman, Property in Wild Animals Escaping from Captivity , 21 Law Notes 24 (1917). With respect to hunting and fishing regulation, a series of trends at the state level is perceptible. First, as wildlife law be- comes increasingly subject to federal enactment,21 more and more 20. 242 N.C. 382, 88 S.E.2d 88 (1955). 21. E.g., the programs created by The Endangered Species Act- of 1973, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-43 (1974); The Wildlife Restoration Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 669a to g-1 (1974).</page><page sequence="19">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 601 state programs have been created in response to or are coordinated with similar federal programs. Second, and partly for that reason, emphasis in many states is slowly shifting from propagation of game animals and fish hatcheries to a broader view including the welfare of the overall habitat/ecosystem of both game and non- game species. As the "carrying capacity" concept has gained acceptance, wildlife biologists have come to see that preservation and improvement of habitat for all species do far more to fill the hunter's bag or the fishermen's creel (who incidentally provide the economic support for state fish and game departments) than did all the artificial propagation and transplantation heretofore en- gaged in.22 Third, bounty systems and other forms of predator con- trol are gradually disappearing, although vested commercial stock raising interests have bitterly fought the tendency.23 This much must be gleaned from the popular literature, as legal commenta- tors have avoided this area of law. As noted above, Dickens, supra , has included a pioneering survey of some varieties of state wildlife laws, and it is the only one located. Mississippi's fish and game regulations were sketchily explained in Note, Mississippi Game and Fish Regulations , 26 Miss. L.J. 230 (1955), again, the only piece of its kind located. A good, but not very "legal" sourcebook for the topic is W. Sigler, Wildlife Law Enforcement (2d ed. 1972). Minor, related articles on fishing rights and regulations include: McKinlay, The Washington Fisheries Code of 1949; Constitu- tionality of Discriminatory Provisions, 24 Wash. L. Rev. 274 (1949); Constitutional Law , Due Process , Fishing Rights in the Pub- lic Waters of Michigan , 32 Mich. L.

Powers of game wardens in enforcing the regulations have also received some attention: 22. See generally D.L. Allen, Our Wildlife Legacy (rev. ed. 1962). 23.

S.B.J. 188 (1930). Regulation of wildlife - if one includes shellfish in that category - as a commercial resource has also received some scholarly atten- tion. E.g., Power, More About Oysters than You Wanted to Know , 30 Md. L. Rev. 199 (1970); Comment, Estuarine Pollution : The Deterioration of the Oyster Industry in North Carolina, 49 N.C.L. Rev. 921 (1971); and Comment, Oil and Oysters Don't Mix : Private Remedies for Pollution Damage to Shellfish , 23 Ala. L. Rev. 100 (1970). See also Schell, Estuaries of Oregon - Ecosystems in Crisis : Prob- lems and Legal Solutions, 2 Env. L. 83 (1971). Closely related to hunting and fishing regulation is the subject of relations between the state and its citizens in other wildlife matters. The power of the state to regulate the taking of fish and game, particularly on privately owned (and possibly privately stocked) land and water, has been an issue since the Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forests, and continues to be disputed by courts and commentators today. It is generally established that not only does state law extend to citizens hunting and fishing on pri- vate land, it governs the manner in which they may hunt and fish. For a discussion of this exercise of the police power, concluding that no public interest justifies such an invasion of the domain of private property, see Note, Fishing Licenses for Private Lakes , 26 U.M.K. C.L. Rev. 123 (1958).

Dickens, supra , has the most comprehensive survey of state statutes (as of 1973), but that compilation is now obsolete due to state legislative responses to the 1973 federal act.24 A narrower treatment, devoted primarily to the Nettleton 25 and Palladio 28 decisions, which upheld New York's endangered species statutes,27 is: Note, Constitutional Problems in Environmental Legislation - The Mason Law , 12 B.C.

As earlier noted, Guilbert, supra , utiliz- ing the Compilation, supra , has published the only comprehensive overview of federal wildlife law. A few articles have dealt with legal protections accorded certain species, and some others have dealt indirectly with habitat protection, but much of the legal literature on federal wildlife law has concentrated on the federal power to legislate in the area. 24.

Connecticut ,28 led many to believe that wildlife, as property of the state, was in the exclu- sive regulatory province or the state. Shortly thereafter, however, Congress passed the Lacey Act,29 forbidding interstate transporta- tion or sale of wildlife illegally taken. The state and federal powers to do so were examined by Flaw, The Power of a State to Forbid the Traffic in or the Possession of Wild Game and Fish When Brought in from another State or Country As Affecting Interstate Commerce , 60 Cent. L.J. 324 (1905). Other similar controversies also received early critical commen- tary, e.g., Dorr, State Control of Fishing Rights , 3 Lawyer &amp; Banker 381 (1910); and Note, Constitutional Law: Game , 20 Geo. L.J. 234 (1932). District courts in 1913 invalidated a federal effort to regulate the taking of migratory birds; see Comment, Game Protection and the Constitution , 14 Mich. L. Rev, 613 (1916), but a later effort premised on implementing treaties was upheld by the Supreme Court in the landmark Missouri u. Holland 30 deci- sion, which spawned many comments on the allowable scope of federal power. See , e.g., Comment, Treaty-Making Power as Support for Federal Legislation , 29 Yale L.J. 445 (1920); and Note, The Treaty Power and the Tenth Amendment , 68 U. Pa. L. Rev. 168 (1920).

The issue of the permissible federal power vis-a-vis wildlife is by no means dead in the legal literature. The decision in New Mexico State Game Comm'n u. Udall ,33 holding federal officers on federal lands exempt from state game regulations, together with passage of legislation further extending federal power, began a recent new round of commentary. See Etling, Who Owns the Wildlife ?, 3 Env. L. 23 (1973); Comment, Federal Protection of Endangered Wildlife Species, 22 Stan. L.

Those powers have been exercised to some extent at various times and in various ways, but no coherent pattern emerges. The discussion following breaks down the little literature available into these cate- gories: Specific Species, Endangered Species; Habitat Protection; and Incidental Protection. A. Specific Species The four main federal laws dealing more or less with specific species or taxa are the Migratory Bird Conservation Act,34 the Bald Eagle Protection Act,35 the Wild Horses and Burros Protection Act,36 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.37 As noted above, the migratory bird statute was the first, and gave rise to much controversy of a constitutional law nature earlier in the cen- tury. More recently, a new look at the potential of the old treaty appeared in Comment, Migratory Bird Treaty: Another Feather in the Environmentalist's Cap , 19 S.D.L. Rev. 307 (1974). The law protecting bald eagles (and, since 1962, golden eagles) has not received scholarly scrutiny nor has its constitutionality been challenged, even though some notorious violations were accorded wide popular publicity.38 For a lively account of the genesis of the Federal Wild Horse and Burros Act, see Johnston, The Fight to Save a Memory , 50 Tex. L. Rev. 1055 (1972). Probably due to widespread interest in the fate of whales and dolphins, manifested in boycotts, press releases, conferences, and so forth, the Marine Mammal Protection Act has received consid- erable attention. A few pre-1972 articles have dealt specifically 34. 16 U.S.C. §§ 715-715r (1974). 35. 16 U.S.C. § 668 (1974). 36. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1331-40 (1974). 37. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1361 et seq. (1974). 38.

Immediately prior to passage of the 1972 Act, the anguish occa- sioned by the perceived predicament of various marine mammals was reduced to writing in Herrington &amp; Regenstein, The Plight of Ocean Mammals, 1 Envir. AFF. 792 (1972). Thereafter, the Act itself was initially dissected and practicalities of implementation discussed in Thompson, Marine Mammals, in A. Reitze, Environ- mental Planning: Law of Land and Resources ch. 18, at 1- 50 (1974). Immodestly put, a more comprehensive article on the potential legal implications of the statute appears in Coggins, Legal Protection for Marine Mammals: An Over- view of Innovative Resource Conservation Legislation, 6 Env. L. 1 (1975). B. Endangered Species Other than state-federal powers and relationships, the only wildlife topic accorded substantial legal attention in recent years is that of endangered species. The first predecessor to the present statute occasioned no comment, but the 1969 amendments3' started the ball rolling. Federal Protection of Endangered Wildlife Species, supra, was devoted primarily to constitutional power to regulate in that somewhat incidental context. Shortly thereafter, several pieces (in addition to the oft-cited Dickens, supra ) directed more at the Act and wildlife appeared: 39. Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1969, Pub. L. No. -91-135, 83 Stat. 275 (1969), repealed, Pub. L. No. 92-205, § 13, 87 Stat. 902 (1973).</page><page sequence="27">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 609 Endangered Wildlife, in A.

Also highly pertinent to the problem of endangered species is: Comment, Commentary Upon the IUCN Draft Convention on the Export, Import and Transit of Certain Species of Wild Animals and Plants, 21 Cath. U.L. Rev. 665 (1972). Many popular works have also been devoted to the problem of vanishing wildlife, and each necessarily includes some bits of legal lore. See, e.g., Matthiessen, supra, S. Simon &amp; P. Gerodet, supra, and Wildlife in Danger, Newsweek, January 6, 1975, at 36; and 12 Nat'l Wildlife 1-63 (April-May 1974). C. Habitat Protection Legislators as well as ecologists have long recognized that to ensure a supply of game, in addition to preserving healthy popula- tions of all wildlife species, it is imperative to provide and main- tain a good quality habitat, suitable to the species, and protected against man's permanent intrusion. Congress in this century has enacted a myriad of laws, a part of each of which has been aimed 40. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-43 (1974).</page><page sequence="28">610 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 at protection of wildlife habitat, and has imposed procedural hur- dles on federal agencies that must be surmounted before those agencies may permit or cause a diminution of that habitat, at least on federal lands. The statutes of most direct relevance to wildlife include: The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, 16 U.S.C. §§ 661-667(e) (1974); The Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. § 1536 (1974); The Anadromous Fish Conservation Act of 1965, 16 U.S.C. §§ 757a-f (1974); Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 669a to g-1 (1974); The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 668dd et seq. (1974); and The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, 16 U.S.C. §§ 460/-4 to /-11 (1974). All of these provisions have gone virtually unnoticed in the legal literature. Guilbert, supra , has included in his overview brief dis- cussions of them, and cases involving several of them have been noted. The decisions in Akers v. Resort construing the Coordina- tion Act in conjunction with NEPA, has not been separately com- mented upon, but another case of similar import, Zabel v.

Other recent federal legislation has had the indirect effect of in- creasing wildlife habitat by providing new federal lands systems where wildlife considerations will receive a higher priority than on private or state lands. In addition to the National Wildlife Refuge Systems, Congress has authorized new national parks (where wild- life is completely protected from hunters and harassment), new national seashores and urban gateway parks, and new systems embodied in: The Wilderness Act of 1964, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1131 et seq. (1974); The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1281- 87 (1974); The National Trails System Act of 1968, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1241- 49 (1974); and The Estuarine Areas Study Act of 1968, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1221- 26 (1974). The new systems for the most part have not been treated sepa- rately or in terms of wildlife by legal commentators, but works on public lands generally abound. Among them are Heyman &amp; Twiss, Environmental Management of the Public Lands , 1 Ecology L.Q. 94 (1971); Henning, The Ecology of the Political/Administrative Pro- cess for Wilderness Classification , 11 Nat. Res. J. 69 (1971); Knibb, National Recreation Areas: Evolving Legislative An- swer to Land Use Conflicts , 6 Lincoln L. Rev. 1 (1970); Caldwell, The Ecosystem as a Criterion for Public Land Policy , 10 Nat. Res.

Two fine articles on wilderness preservation are McCloskey, The Wilderness Act of 1964 , Its Background and Meaning , 45 Ore. L. Rev. 288 (1966); and</page><page sequence="30">612 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 Note, National Wilderness Preservation Bill ; A Question of Values , 7 Utah L. Rev. 107 (1960). The Public Land Law Review Commission Report, published in 1969, was the focus of a special issue of Land and Water Law Review : Symposium Presenting an Analysis of the Public Land Law Review Commission Report , 6 Land &amp; Water L. Rev. 1 (1970). Unfortunately, the two articles dealing specifically with the Report's implications for wildlife, R.W. Johnson, Recreation , Fish, Wildlife and the PLLRCR , 6 Land &amp; Water L. Rev. 283; and K.E. Barnhill, Jr., Outdoor Recreation and the PLLRCR , 6 Land &amp; Water L. Rev. 299; are analytically vague though definite enough in conclusion: inso- far as Johnson attempts to analyze the Report's structure and function, he finds it "inconsistent, contradictory, and specious," and reflecting "irritation with Sierra Club type claims." The traditional multiple-use theory of utilization of public land has come under critical scrutiny of late. See , Loesch, Multiple Uses of Public Lands - Accommodation or Choosing Between Conflicting Uses , 16 Rocky Mt. M.L. Inst. 1 (1971); Harvey, Public Land Management Under the Classification and Multiple Use Act , 2 Nat. Res. L. 238 (1969); Starr, Multiple Use Land Management , 1 Nat. Res.

Incidental Protection Forms of wildlife, as integral parts of all ecologie systems, are affected in fairly direct proportion to the state of the overall envi- ronment. Fish, for instance, are more affected by water pollution than we are. Legal control of pollution, while undoubtedly relevant to wildlife problems, is, however, of such magnitude by itself that no attempt will be made here to provide even a sampling. A few</page><page sequence="31">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 613 articles that attempt an overall perspective on particular ecosys- tems, however, should be noted: Clingan, Jr., Law Affecting the Quality of the Marine Environment , 26 U. Miami L. Rev. 223 (1971); Jordan, Great Lakes Pollution: A Framework for Action , 5 Ottawa L. Rev. 65 (1971); and Baldwin, Public Policy on Oil - An Ecological Perspective , 1 Ecology L.Q. 245 (1971). One particular pollution problem which is even more directly related to wildlife welfare is the widespread use of pesticides. Rachel Carson, in her landmark 1962 book, Silent Spring, elo- quently demonstrated the need for immediate re-evaluation of our national policies concerning DDT and related pesticides. Since then, the relation between pesticides and environmental quality has been a topic of growing legal and ecological concern. Generally, see van den Bosch, Insecticides and the Law , 22 Hastings L.J. 615 (1971); W. H. Rodgers, Jr., Persistent Problem of the Persistent Pes- ticides: A Lesson in Environmental Law, 70 Colum. L. Rev. 567 (1970); Rohrman, Pesticide Laws and Legal Implications of Pesticide Use , 23 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 142, 172 (1968); and Clement, Pesticide Problem , 8 Nat. Res. J. 11 (1968). A more specific treatment of applicable federal laws and the workings of the pertinent federal bureaucracy is found in Pesticides and the Environment , 24 Ad. L. Rev. 121 (1972), which details the administrative structure and function of the pesticide-regulatory system. See also the fulsomely entitled: Environmental Law - Federal Insecticide , Fungicide , and Rodenticide Act -The Abuse of Discretion Standard of Re- view is Employed to Compel Agency Action Unreasonably Delayed Concerning the Issuance of Cancellation Notices and Summary Suspension Orders , 40 U. Cín. L. Rev. 598 (1971). Two notes with opposing views on the 1972 amendment to the federal pesticide law are: Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972 , 40 Tenn. L. Rev. 538 (1973); and</page><page sequence="32">614 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972 : A Compromise Approach , 3 Ecology L.Q. 277 (1973). A variety of other federal statutes have the effect if not the aim of protecting or otherwise affecting wildlife. The two best-known are the Parklands statute,44 made famous in the Overton Park 45 decision, and NEPA, the cornerstone of contemporary environ- mental litigation. The former provides substantive and procedural safeguards before highways can be built through existing parks; in addition to the voluminous commentary on Overton Park and sim- ilar cases, including Giorgio, Parklands and Federally Funded Highway Projects: The Impact of Conservation Society v. Texas, 1 Envir. Aff. 882 (1972); and Comment, The Road to Overton Park : (&lt;Parklands Statutes" in Federal Highway Legislation , 39 Tenn. L. Rev. 433 (1972); see also Favoring Parks over Highways - A First Step Toward Resolv- ing the Conflict Between Preservation of Environmental Amenities and Expansion of the Highway System, 57 Iowa L. Rev. 834 (1972). Written from the perspective of a plaintiff seeking judicial review of the administrative selection of a highway route, and suggesting further pragmatic steps toward resolution of the conflict of inter- ests, this article should prove to be of interest and value to both legislators and litigants. Other useful works, urging imaginative use of existing legal devices (such as exclusive use zoning, compul- sory dedication of land, eminent domain, and conservation ease- ments) to preserve our heritage of open land, are Moore, The Acquisition and Preservation of Open Lands, 23 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 274 (1966); and Note, Preservation of Parklands, 24 Baylor L. Rev. 170 (1972). NEPA applies whenever a federal agency permits, authorizes, or commences a major federal project; if that project will affect wild- 44.

However, save for a few pages in Guilbert, supra , no author has examined NEPA in just that light although NEPA articles are legion. The best of the genre are Fred Anderson's two coiñmentaries: F. Anderson &amp; R. Daniels, NEPA in the Courts (1973); and Anderson, The National Environmental Policy Act in Federal Environmental Law ch. 4 (E. Dolgin &amp; T. Guilbert eds. 1974). Other incidental protection for wildlife can be inferred from other federal legislation or developments. The fact that there is a Fish and Wildlife Service within the Department of the Interior indi- cates a continuing federal concern. The current administrative controversy over the use of predator control poisons on federal lands also indicates a concern and highlights the ideological differ- ences between commercial interests and non-commercial champi- ons of wildlife rights. The federal government is heavily involved in predator control, but only Dickens, supra , has analyzed that problem from a legal viewpoint. Lay expositions of the area, neces- sarily including quasi-legal discussions, may be located in D.L. Allen, supra , P. Matthiessen, supra, and J. Olsen, Slaughter the Animals, Poison the Earth (1974). For further background, see also Olson, New Methods Tried For Elk Control , Balance of Nature May be the Answer in Yellowstone Park , 19 Am. Ri- fleman #4 at 18 (1971), and compare , Environmental Safeguards on Activities for Animal Damage Control on Federal Lands , Exec. Order No. 11,643, 3A C.F.R. 140 (Supp. 1972 Comp.); with Exec. Order No. 11,643, as amended by Exec. Order No. 11,870, 40 Fed. Reg. 30611 (1975). Many other statutes mention fish and wildlife as interests to be considered along with other factors in various contexts, but all of these incidental protections have gone without scholarly analysis or explanation.</page><page sequence="34">616 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 IV. Some Literature on the International "Law" of Wildlife Pertinent to the United States Many wildlife problems have international ramifications, but this limited bibliography can mention but a few. Already cited in § III are works dealing with migratory birds, marine mammals, and endangered species, all of which areas are intimately bound up with international agreements and obligations. Literature on the law of the sea generally is excluded; the following is a list of articles on fisheries, selected at random from the extant mass: Bilder, The Anglo-Icelandic Fisheries Dispute , 1973 Wise. L. Rev. 37; Jacobson, Bridging the Gap to international Fisheries Agree- ment: A Guide for Unilateral Action , 9 San Diego L. Rev. 454 (1972); Allen, Law y Fish , and Policy , 5 Int'l Lawyer 621 (1971); Carroz and Roche, International Policing of High Seas Fisheries , 6 Can. Y.B. Int'l L. 61 (1968); Comment, North Pacific Fisheries Treaties and International Law of the Seas, 38 Wash. L. Rev. 223 (1963); Bishop, Jr., 1958 Geneva Convention on Fishing and Conser- vation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, 62 Colum. L. Rev. 1206 (1962). Another related subject that has generated considerable com- mentary is regulation of the resources on the outer continental shelf, although most writers focus on oil and minerals with less emphasis on living marine resources. A representative sample in- cludes: Miron, The Outer Continental Shelf - Managing (or Misman- aging) its Resources, 2 J. Maritime L. 267 (1971); Krueger, Background of the Doctrine of the Continental Shelf and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 10 Nat. Res. J. 442 (1970); Stone, United States legislation Relating to the Continental Shelf, 17 Int'l &amp; Comp. L.Q. 103 (1968); Young, Sedentary Fisheries and the Convention on the Conti- nental Shelf, 55 Am. J. Int'l. L. 359 (1961); Comment, Lagging Law of the Continental Shelf : Some Problems and Proposals, 22 Cath. U.L. Rev. 131, (1972); and Comment, Continental Shelf Law: Outdistanced by Science and Technology, 31 La. L. Rev. 108 (1970").</page><page sequence="35">1975] WILDLIFE BIBLIOGRAPHY 617 Many students of wildlife conservation law insist that the only viable way to protect wildlife species in danger is multilaterally; that is, by some comprehensive international scheme, endorsed and enforced equally around the world. Otherwise, the most effec- tive unilateral protective measures break down at the border. See Falk, The Global Environment and International Law: Challenge and Response , 23 Kan. L. Rev. 385 (1975); Lanctot, Marine Pollution: A Critique of Present and Pro- posed International Agreements and Institutions - A Sug- gested Global Oceans' Environmental Regime, 24 Hastings L.J. 67 (1972); Falk, Toward a World Order Respectful of the Global Environment , 1 Envir. Aff. 251 (1971); and Douglas, Environmental Problems of the Oceans : the Need for International Controls, 1 Env. L. 149 (1971). For the most part things have not worked out that way. Even where treaties are negotiated, enforcement is nil, justifying the quotation marks around the word "law" in the heading of this section. Therefore, most analysis and commentary (and it is volu- minous) concerns itself with elaborating upon the diplomatic and political difficulties inherent in such a plan, and recounting the numerous failures of international co-operative efforts toward effective wildlife conservation. For a rare, hopeful perspective in this area, see Von Holstein, Protection of Animals by Means of Interna- tional Law, 18 Int'l &amp; Comp. L.Q. 771 (1969), which heralds the Convention for the Protection of Animals During International Transport which was signed in 1968 by eight Euro- pean nations as the first step toward comprehensive animal protec- tion. Others have advocated innovative uses of international treat- ies, doctrines, and strategies: Coan, Hillis &amp; McCloskey, Strategies for International Ac- tion: The Case for an Environmentally Oriented Foreign Policy , 14 Nat. Res. J. 87 (1974); Guilbert, Wilderness Reservation I : A Recent Case and a Not-so-Recent Treaty, 3 ELR 50023 (1973); and Guilbert, Wilderness Preservation II: Bringing the Conven- tion into Court, 3 ELR 50044 (1973).</page><page sequence="36">618 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 6 The skeptic may suspect that the dearth of international legal protection for wildlife is directly related to the failure of individual nations to clean up their own houses on that score. The optimist will note, however, that the volume and severity of both national and international law relating to wildlife welfare grows almost daily. The realist will be skeptical of new legislation and agree- ments until effective implementation has been demonstrated at crucial levels, and will optimistically see in the future a burgeoning legal recognition of the values and need for protection of wildlife, so long as those goals are held by the people of the Nation and the world. V. Conclusion Tom Guilberťs chapter on federal wildlife law, cited fre- quently herein, closed with this sentence: "The author hopes that one of his readers will take this cue to make this chapter a ' rough draft' for a much-needed definitive study of wildlife law." We have attempted to move that desire one small step further toward realization by compiling and categorizing some of the dis- consonant materials that will become building blocks for that defi- nitive study. However, to paraphrase another of Guilberťs conclu- sions, we are under no illusions that we have exhausted wildlife law literature in our foregoing compilation. The complexity of the topic is immense, with its varigated subject matter and endlessly over- lapping jurisdictions. But it is perhaps a reflection of the priority assigned to wildlife law in the overall scheme of things that no attempt has heretofore been made to make the kind of compilation done above. Wildlife law is in its infancy as a discrete legal subject matter. As it emerges, clarification will be as important as innovation. There is much law on and in the books right now that is hardly ever used, due in part to its inaccessibility to most lawyers. This is changing rapidly, and the future promises far more change.</page></plain_text>
