<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dancing and the Dark Soul of Japan: An Aesthetic Analysis of Buto Vicki Sanders Hijikata Tatsumi, a poor farm boy from Akita, in northeast Japan, was a teenager when the United States dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He intended a career in classical dance, but just as the atomic assault forever altered the course of Japanese political history, so did its aftershocks indelibly mark the nation's emerging artists and their attitude toward the aesthetic roots from which they sprang. Hijikata's cause was not antiwar, his dances not antibomb. He came of age as a dancer and choreographer, however, at a time when his country lay in ruins, when there was an opportunity to change a rigid class structure, to throw off the mantle of Westernism, to rediscover and redefine what it meant to be Japanese. One way to attack the oppressive aspects of social tradition was to expose the underbelly, to explore "the dark truths that hid beneath the Japanese social mask" (Stein 1986a, 115). That is what Hijikata set out to do when he turned his back on conventional dance forms and entered instead an artistic substratum that condoned his revolutionary ideas. Critic Donald Richie, who has lived in Japan for more than forty years, says Hijikata's aim was to startle an unyielding, class-conscious Japan into recognizing the presence of its out casts, its so-called nonpeople: the vagrants, prostitutes, whoremongers, drunks, homeless, and impoverished (Richie 1986). Blemishes on the nation's powdered white cheek, they became Hijikata's metaphor for all that was rejected by Japan's classical definition of beauty. In the protective shadow of the 1950s and 1960s avant-garde, Hiji Vicki Sanders has been a dance and theatre critic for The Berkshire Eagle, The Providence Journal, and The Miami Herald. In 1986 she conducted research in Japan as a Gannett Fellow in Asian Studies at the University of Hawaii.</page><page sequence="2">Buto 149 kata developed a style of choreographic extremism he called ankoku buto, interpreted to mean "dance of darkness" or "dance of the dark soul," a term later abbreviated simply to buto. He built his new dance using the reprobates' crude physical features and uncouth habits (defecatory stances and perverse sexual gestures, for instance), a direct assault on the refinement (miyabi) and understatement (shibui) so valued in Japanese aes thetics.1 For example, in Forbidden Colors (Kinjiki), a 1959 piece based on a work by author Mishima Yukio, Hijikata depicted bestiality in what his torian Lizzie Slater describes as "a violent spasm of antidance: a young man clutches a live chicken between his thighs, in the midst of a brutaliz ing act of buggery. In the darkness, the audience perceives the advancing footsteps of another man" (Stein 1986a, 115). When several members of the sponsoring organization, the All Japan Art Dance Association, threatened to resign because of the per formance, Hijikata left instead, followed by some of his collaborators. Sla ter contends that the departure signaled buto's break from the mainstream modern dance world. It also marked the beginning of an experimental movement that would become internationally known and would engage scores of dancers, choreographers, and companies by the time of Hijika ta's death from liver disease in January 1986 at the age of fifty-seven. During its thirty years of evolution, buto has undergone many changes. Among them has been a tempering of its grotesquerie, making the dance somewhat more palatable to both Japanese and foreign audi ences. In fact, much of the current choreography displays lyricism, gen tleness, humor, and even an occasional sign of playfulness, a quality nota bly found in the dances of the troupes Dai Rakudakan and Byakkosha (Plate 4). Buto retains many of the qualities of darkness instilled by its originator. These characteristics have by now formed themselves into an aesthetic, making it possible to examine the dance in relation to tradi tional Japanese art and philosophy. The aim here is to explore the buto aesthetic using the observations of Western critics and of the performers themselves. Beauty and the Beast All great myths are dark and one cannot imagine all the great Fables aside from a mood of slaughter, torture and bloodshed, telling the masses about the original division of the sexes and the slaughter of essences that came with creation. Theatre, like the plague, is made in the image of this slaughter, this essential division. It unravels conflicts, liberates powers, releases potential and if these and the powers are dark, this is not the fault of the plague or theatre, but life. ?Antonin Artaud, Theatre and Its Double2</page><page sequence="3">150 Sanders Artaud's description cuts to the heart of Japan's dance of dark ness, with its eerie, mutantlike qualities, its crudeness and freakish anthropomorphism (Plate 1). Dancemagazine managing editor Richard Philp has written that buto shunned the stylization of such aesthetically acceptable Japanese dance forms as no and kabuki. Instead, he observed that the dancers, reduced themselves to "animal" basics through the use of nudity, shaved heads and stark white makeup. The content of the move ment probed deep, troubled areas of our collective unconscious, and strove to expose man's most primitive instincts?survival at the cost of brutality, killing, destruction and death (1986, 61). Buto dancers use a fresh, sometimes nightmarish vocabulary of grimace and gesture that seems at once prehistoric and futuristic. With this altered view, they share a purpose of experimental and avant-garde artists everywhere, to foist a new vision of reality on the postwar gen eration. Eiko and Koma are New York-based performers who emerged from the buto school, but who no longer consider themselves part of the genre. This is how they experience dance: When we perform, we like to imagine that each of us is a fresh fish which was just caught and is on the cutting board. The fish intuits that some body will eat it. No room to be coquettish. The fish's body is tight, shin ing blue, eyes wide open. No way to escape (Kriegsman 1985, B14). Their viewpoint is reminiscent of the traditional Japanese aes thetic concept of mono no aware, the sorrow-tinged appreciation of transi tory beauty, so idealized in the art of the Heian period (794-1185), and particularly in The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari) of Murasaki Shikibu. Buto also accepts and appreciates the transitory, but denies without apol ogy that pretty things are the proprietary symbols of impermanence. Nor is this the only traditional aesthetic ideal that touches buto. "Beauty filtered through the prism of the grotesque remains beauty none theless," wrote dance critic Anna Kisselgoff after seeing a 1985 perform ance of Admiring La Argentina by Ono Kazuo, Hijikata's chief collaborator in the formation of buto (Kisselgoff 1985c, sec. 2:16). Her statement describes Ono's artistic skill in orchestrating a transformation of his wiz ened 79-year-old body. Dressed in women's clothes, he pays tribute to the great Spanish dancer and in the process convincingly transcends the peculiar reality of his own aged presence and evokes the youthful vitality of his patron.</page><page sequence="4">Buto 151 Figure 7. Ono Kazuo, a collaborator with Hijikata Tatsumi in the formation of buto, performs Admiring La Argentina, a choreographic tribute to the great Spanish dancer who inspired him to a career in dance. (Photo: Naoya-Ikegami; courtesy Ono Kazuo.) In another era, Ono might have been a no master, for revolution ary as buto is, it has nevertheless inherited much of the aesthetic sensibility of its classical predecessor. Compare, for example, the above description of Argentina to the following one on no: Yugen literally means "obscure and dark," but this darkness is a metaphor for a perfection of beauty so subde that it cannot be portrayed by form</page><page sequence="5">152 Sanders alone. A classic illustration ofyugen is the moon shining behind a veil of cloud, or, in no, a superb old man dancing the role of a beautiful young woman, his inner power transforming the voice and body of old age. This inner power does not imitate beauty, it suggests beauty, and the consum mate no actor combines the shamanistic energy of ancient Shinto ritual with the cool meditative objectivity of Zen Buddhism to communicate yugen to the audience directly and unmistakably (Oomoto 1980, 27). The buto performer, in such an instance, purposely points to something beyond himself, inviting the audience to contemplate an unre vealed essence. In the words of novelist Tanizaki Junichiro: "Such is our way of thinking?we find beauty not in the thing itself but in the patterns of the shadows, the light and the darkness, that one thing against another creates" (1977, 30). The Body and Buto Hijikata once told a fellow dancer: In our body, history is hidden . . . and will appear in each detail of our expressions. In butoh we can find, touch, our hidden reality?something can be born, can appear, living and dying at the same moment (Stein 1986a, 125). The dramatic tension felt in buto's stillness, eroticism, intensity, facial disfigurement, and gestural distortion is the artistic manifestation of a fundamental aesthetic conflict. This conflict began when Hijikata turned away from the Western styles of dance, ballet and modern, that have predominated in twentieth-century Japan. He felt the Japanese body was not made for such movement, that the imported forms did not fit the substance of Japanese life. According to Donald Richie, a close observer of the early work, Hijikata was the first contemporary choreographer to revel in the squat, earthbound physique of his countrymen and the natural movements of the common folk (Richie 1986). Tanaka Min, a well-known buto soloist, has said that Hijikata was motivated by anger at how bodies had been controlled historically: "Behind the social face we have many faces. He tried to take them off. That makes very strange movements, very strange faces" (1986, 146). There was, however, a gradual formalization of the movement that distressed Hijikata, as it did some of buto's early supporters: "Like everything human, it codified and lost what cutting edge it had. That sort of thing happens particularly fast in Japan. Now you have a known vo</page><page sequence="6">Figure 8. Tanaka Min, who only recently aligned himself with Hijikata and the buto movement, has worked independendy for years, mosdy as a soloist.

Despite this, many practitioners of buto remain devoted to expand ing the repertoire, among them soloists Nakajima Natsu and Goi Teru, Hijikata protege Ashikawa Yoko, and the Sankaijuku, Dai Rakudakan, and Byakkosha troupes. The wide variety of styles thriving among the buto companies is, in fact, proof that the energy of the movement has not been sapped, only changed, by formalization. One aspect of style they all share is the use of "primitive," or "nat ural," postures. The impression this can make on the Western mind is exemplified in the comments of writer Susan Reiter: "With their shaved heads and whitened, vulnerable-looking bodies, these not-quite-human creatures appear to commune with timeless natural forces. [The danc ers] communicate a deep, sensual awareness of kinship with nature" (1986, 43). In the 1985 New York premiere of Butterfly Butterfly (Tefu tefu), solo ist Kisanuki Kuniko similarly impressed critic Kisselgoff, who said of the experience: "To see a dancer suddenly transformed into a piece of drift wood, with all the beauty of nature's own abstract forms, is to see a highly gifted dancer" (1985a, C:24).

Dairakudakan, a company of men and women whose epic story dances are phantasmagorical journeys into the Japanese psyche, was one of the first troupes to tour the United States. (Photo: Nourit Sekine-Masson.) In order to understand buto, however, one must not forget the role of the mind. Though similar to Western styles of dance in its emphasis on physicality, athleticism, and technique, buto demands that its performers be spiritually developed as well. Buto, says critic Jennifer Dunning, "is grounded in the life of the mind and memory and in the personal 'biographies,' as Ono puts it, that exist within a universal history" (1985,C:27). In this respect, certainly, buto embraces rather than rejects Japa nese tradition. It is entirely possible, for example, to apply to buto what Ito Sachiyo writes about classical Japanese dance in general: "The transcen dence of body has been stressed throughout the history of Japanese dance. ... So it is that we strive to master technique for its potential translation into breadth of expression and depth of content. ..." (1979, 277). Themes and Variations Buto's primary themes are metamorphosis, transcendence, and death or nothingness preceding birth or rebirth, issues which these Japanese dancers have chosen to address with all their inherent violence intact. In the opening scenario of their most famous piece, Homage to Pre history (Jomon sho), Sankaijuku epitomizes these themes (Plate 3). Four</page><page sequence="9">156 Sanders amorphous shapes are lowered into view, writhing, contracting into fetal poses, and finally lengthening into the form of men as they descend. The ability of Homage to Prehistory to communicate its themes across cultural boundaries is evidenced in the kind of responses it elicits from Western observers. Critic Martin A. David, for example, started his dis cussion of the two grand circles scene with a straightforward description, but soon was caught up in trying to interpret what he had seen. The rings were large enough to encompass a car, he began, and lay flat on the stage until they were raised slowly to stand on edge. Then he wrote: "They are openings to and from death, the portals of other, parallel dimensions, the roundness of earth itself and?intertwined?the symbols of the atom which is both the birth of the future and the fiery death of the past" (1984, 18). The motifs of creation and destruction that permeate so much of the buto repertoire have led numerous Westerners to link the imagery to the nuclear holocaust and its aftereffects. Kisselgoff, for example, wrote of one scene in Homage to Prehistory: "... the most evocatively terrifying image here is one that features four fishlike creatures starting up to stare into the bright glow emanating from the wings while a thundering sound rumbles on. We next see Amagatsu [Ushio] himself as a foreshort ened mutant, a body that later breaks apart before our very eyes" (1986, C:15). In Grain, a work by Eiko and Koma, dance critic Alan M. Kriegs man found the themes of struggle and death beneath a cloak of sexuality and lust (1985, B.14). To paraphrase Kriegsman: Eiko is naked and sprawled beside a mound of rice. Music drones and keens in the back ground. She, the archetypal temptress and prey, is seduced by Koma, the predator. Eiko then appears to give birth, and Koma becomes, simultane ously, her suckling infant and a violent lover who chokes her. He later returns to her inert form carrying candles and rice, and she stirs to life, only to be ravaged sexually once more as she stuffs her mouth with rice. Then he stamps out the candles, and they disappear into the void of dark ness. Kriegsman was disturbed that the dancers executed their work with an air of detachment, saying that he found the result "dismayingly coldblooded." One must remember, however, that Eiko and Koma do not represent all buto performers. "Coldblooded" is not a term that can be applied to Ono Kazuo, for example. In his dances, the themes of birth, maturation, aging, and death are presented with remarkable poignancy. He can appear at once detached and morally compassionate. As Kisselgoff says, "There is an enduring humanity about [him], which in no way runs counter to the seriousness of his meditation upon the universe" (1985b, C:19).</page><page sequence="10">w Figure 11. Sankaijuku's famous hanging piece, here presented in Osaka, led in 1985 to the death of dancer Takada Yoshiyuki in Seattle, Washington, when a frayed rope broke and he plummeted eighty feet.

Trained in buto, they no longer consider themselves part of the genre. (Photo: David Fullard; courtesy Pentacle.) It is possible that one reason Ono's dances have such impact is they often build on the tension between giri (social obligation) and ninjo (human feelings). When these two moral elements are in conflict with one another in an artistic context, as in a tormented father's decision to slay his son out of fealty to his lord, a natural theatrical tension is established. Ono's close associates have observed that he no longer commutes between life and art; he himself says he makes no distinction between the stage and daily life. Indeed, he appears to work from a level that recog nizes few boundaries. This transcendental quality in Ono's dances has not escaped the notice of Western critics. Kisselgoff has observed that "he can fuse the coarse with the delicate, the universal symbol with the por trait in miniature. . . ." (1985b, C:19). And Philp has written: "Out of the grotesque, Ono limns beauty; out of corruption, innocence; out of darkness, light; out of death, life. . . . He and light have become one" (1986, 62). The depth of Ono's absorption is further hinted at in dance critic Marcia B. Siegel's comments on The Dead Sea, a dance in which he depicts a woman's journey through life to death. Siegel observes that "the 79</page><page sequence="12">Buto 159 year-old performer is waging an intense competition, a wresding match where he gets so intimate with death that he sometimes acquires his adversary's face" (Stein 1986a, 119). Though Ono may not in fact view death as an adversary, Siegel's description is important because it gives a measure of the intensity with which the dancer performs and the serious ness with which he takes his themes of metamorphosis and transcendence. The Journey Within Most Japanese art forms expect artists to push beyond visible lim its, increasing their emotional and physical strength until they also achieve a heightened spiritual sensibility. Indeed, buto authority Bonnie Sue Stein of the Asia Society in New York contends that "working beyond self-imposed boundaries, passing through the gates of limitation into undiscovered territory" is the key to buto (1986a, 116). Zeami Motokiyo (1363-1443), no's chief theoretician, outlined in Nine Stages (Kyui) a progressive system of actor development based in part on his own studies of Zen. It is clear that buto dancers see a similar spirit ual dimension in their work. Sankaijuku founder Amagatsu Ushio, for example, describes buto as a style in which the body enters a state of perfect balance between life and death, between human reality and the unknown (Cocks 1984, 109). In other words, a buto performance may be said to exist in mu no basho, a place of nothingness, where mushin (no-mind) prevails. The outward manifestation of this accomplishment is perceived by audience and per former alike as a trancelike state. As dancer Tanaka Min has said, "When I am dancing I can think and feel more than usual. If I continued this awareness all the time, I would be crazy. It is like a dream" (1986, 151). Lonny Joseph Gordon, an American modern dancer who studied no in Japan, gives an account of his experience that could well be that of a buto performer: Transcending is something that becomes a deeper riddle with each solu tion or perception achieved. ... It continues far beyond the stage or stu dio into the most private recesses of life and consciousness. It becomes equal parts of concentration and abandon, gravity and flight, focus and detachment, going beyond by working through your center (1981, 26). Space, Stillness, and the Overflow of Feelings "Buto dancers' bodies are like a cup filled to overflowing, one that cannot take one more drop of liquid" (David 1984, 18). The Japanese aesthetic quality that describes this dimension of buto isyojo, or overflow of</page><page sequence="13">Figure 13. Byakkosha, a Kyoto-based company that lives and works commu nally, is attempting to take buto in new, often more playful directions. (Photo: Nourit Sekine-Masson.)</page><page sequence="14">Buto 161 feeling. Philosopher Izutsu Toyo defines it as what happens when thought (omoi) and feeling (jo) swell through the so-called heart-mind (kokoro) in a rush of unrestrained artistic freedom. This concept is loosely related to another Japanese aesthetic idea (ma), a space or an interval of silence/stillness. Ma, a cultural paradigm, is the empty space in a tea bowl, what is left unsaid in a haiku poem, the sound/silence ratio in music, the foreground/background distance in an inkwash painting, the moments of repose in a no drama. Here is how it appears in buto: Every moment seems to spring from a focused stillness that initiates the next step. . . . Emptiness is not a void but a vast space full of choices, brewing together until one simple idea emerges. . . . Butoh dancers wait until the time is right, then spring into action (Stein 1986b, 68). Yojo, then, can be described as the creative substance flowing from the dancer into the space at that moment of spontaneous combustion. In Ono's words: The empty stage, the bare stage you appear on without any preparation, does not mean that it contains nothing. . . . The vacant space is gradu ally being filled, and in the end something is realized there. It may be the kind of thing that takes a lifetime to learn?in my case, I instantaneously knew the fact that the empty space actually was filled and I danced in joy and excitement (Stein 1986a, 120). One final trademark of buto is its glacial pacing. An irritant to audiences accustomed to visual bombardment in their entertainment, it nevertheless offers rewards to those who are attentive. As the Japanese avant-garde theatre director Ota Shogo has said, scarcity of action in the theatre can suggest that "something mystic, awesome and meaningful is occurring" (Brandon 1985, 76). Forced to use their imagination to unravel the mystery before them, viewers can be drawn into the creative process, an activity often denied them by more popular theatrical forms that feel compelled to spoon-feed audiences. In Conclusion To paraphrase Donald Richie: It is impossible to imagine buto hav ing emerged in any nation but Japan. The dance is wholeheartedly oriental, from its squat-bodied move ment idiom to its spirituality, from its post-Hiroshima rebelliousness to its present-day codification.</page><page sequence="15">162 Sanders Having rejected Western forms and many of Japan's refined aes thetic qualities as restrictive and irrelevant, founder Hijikata set about inventing his own art based on refinement's opposites: crudeness, vulgar ity, commonness. Yet, judging from the reactions of Western critics, it would seem that, despite Hijikata's intentions, traditional Japanese aes thetics are not absent in buto, but simply reclothed in starker forms, more primitive movements, and in the awareness of human fragility in an age of nuclear weapons and social decay.
