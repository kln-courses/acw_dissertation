Clements School of Natural Resources 244 Hardin Hall, University of Nebraska Lincoln, NE 68583-0974 ABSTRACT—The relationships among seasonal change, population dynamics, social pressures, landscape dynamics, anthropologic disturbances, and behavioral ecology are complex. Therefore, migration and seasonal movements are poorly understood and dispersal continues to be one of the least understood aspects of animal ecology in North America. We reviewed scientific literature on movements of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) in western and midwestern landscapes to identify gaps in our knowl edge and direct future research. We used electronic databases, library catalogs, Internet search engines, and peer-reviewed journals to conduct key word searches for pertinent articles. We found that deer disperse due to habitat conditions and social pressures that are based on seasonal influences. Dispersal rates and distances vary regionally and are influenced by landscape characteristics and competition for resources such as food, cover, and mates. Migration and dispersal may influence local population levels. Decisions to manipulate densities, sex ratios, and age structures should account for local deer movements.

Transition ranges can provide them with bet ter foraging opportunities, allowing them to recover body CONCLUSIONS condition earlier in the spring and maintain body condi tion later in the fall (Short 1981).

White-tailed deer may rest of inbreeding and sexual competition is postulated to be at transition areas for a few hours to several days before the ultimate mechanism of dispersal and is connected to continuing migration (Nelson et al. 2004). In some cases, the proximate mechanisms of dispersal, maternal-adult individuals that stop at transition ranges may be respond- female aggression (Ozoga and Verme 1985; Nixon et al. ing to immediate hunger or fatigue. 1991) and male breeding competition (Kammermeyer and Marchinton 1976; Rosenberry et al. 2001; McCoy et Fidelity to Seasonal Ranges al. 2005). Annual variability in climate, particularly snow depths, may be responsible for mixed migration behavior Both mule and white-tailed deer exhibit high fidelity (Nicholson et al. 1997; Sabine et al. 2002). Knowledge of to seasonal home ranges and may move long distances regional dispersal and migration patterns may be impor through suitable habitats or areas used by other deer when tant in understanding the suitability and effects of efforts en-route to traditional seasonal ranges (Gruell and Papez to manage habitat and populations (Nelson and Mech 1963; Papez 1976; Carpenter et al. 1979; Tiersen et al. 1992). 1985; Garrott et al. 1987; Thomas and Irby 1990; Sawyer Populations that exhibit dispersal and migratory et al. 2005). White-tailed deer deviate very little from tra- behavior may experience a significant exchange of indi ditional migration corridors when traveling to and from viduals across state management zones (Rosenberry et seasonal ranges, suggesting natural selection has favored al. 1999). Deer that exhibit seasonal movements during strong spatial awareness, navigational ability, and affinity the fall may be more vulnerable to harvest, and move for home range location (Nelson et al. 2004). Mule deer ments should be incorporated into wildlife management often show high fidelity to summer ranges (Gruell and plans (Shaw et al. 2006). Migration and dispersal have Papez 1963; Wood et al. 1989; Brown 1992), and may have the potential to influence population dynamics, which less attachment to winter range than summer range (Gar- can reduce accuracy of demographic estimates and influ rott et al. 1987; Brown 1992).

Hygnstrom et al. 227 factors that influence dispersal may be achieved through long-term research. Future research should be directed toward studies that address the role of landscape dynam ics in determining habitat selection after dispersal or migration has been initiated. Research involving move ments of deer can provide insight into transmissible dis eases, such as chronic wasting disease, that may spread across landscapes as a result of seasonal movements.
