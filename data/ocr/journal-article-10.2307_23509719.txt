<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brendan Cole The Mask of Dionysus. A Reinterpretation of Poussin's Triumph of Pan The Triumph of Pan of 1636 [Fig. 1] is undoubtedly one of the greatest masterpieces by Poussin now hanging in the National Gallery, London. In addition to its remarkably inventive visual poetry, it is a scholarly work of great intelligence that marks a high point in the artist's career in Rome during the 1630s. The thor ough planning that went into its creation, which is evident from the numerous preparatory studies that have survived in various collections, clearly shows Poussin's care and concern to create a work of distinction, both visually and intellectually.1 This scene of great energy and delight is most probably a demonstration piece, devised to display his talents and skills to their highest degree; no doubt in order to impress his patron, Cardinal Richelieu, for whom the work was created. No fewer than eleven preliminary sketches survive for this work. The meticulous planning and thought that went into the painting therefore suggests that the subject itself must have been of some importance to the artist, and no doubt to his patron as well. However, the intensity of effort, and unique visual impact, of Poussin's Triumph results in a work that is not easily placed within the repertoire of Poussin's Dionysian imagery. Despite the fact that it is mostly based on motifs associated with the retinue of Dionysus, the actual narrative of this work is not unequivocally clear and has, therefore, remained largely allusive. It is worth emphasising that Poussin had an inexhaust ible interest in themes relating to the narratives, rites and cer Brendan Cole The Mask of Dionysus.

A Reinterpretation of Poussin's Triumph of Pan associated with Dionysian subjects. Many are prominently cata logued in the foreground of the Triumph and include, from left to right: the syrinx (or panpipe associated with Pan), a pine cone and an ivy-entwined thyrsus (the pine cone-tipped fennel stick associated with Dionysus), two masks (references to the Dionysian origins of drama) and a timbrel, which rest on the rocky ledge in the foreground. Above these we see another grotesque mask, resting on an anthropomorphic shroud, as well as a shepherd's crook, a basket of flowers and towards the right another thyrsus, a drinking cup half-filled with wine and an urn decorated with a Dionysian tableau; cymbals hanging under the drape on the pillar to the right complete the repertoire of Dionysian musical instruments. The main scene of this work, in the middle ground, con sists of eleven adult revellers and two children amongst whom are maenads, satyrs, panes, musicians and other figures clad in wreathes of ivy, vine or fir. These are all commonly associated with participants in Dionysian rituals. The symmetrical arrange ment of the revellers is an astonishing essay in tightly integrated figurai composition and precision of formal design, centred on the central, gilded herm. The two main figures of this group are dressed in blue, arranged either side the herm and supported on goats. Each is drawing flowers from a basket; the one on the left, who looks directly at the herm, grasps a handful of blossoms from a basket carried on the head of a kneeling Greek satyr (identified by the pointed ears). She appears to be about to scatter these in the direction of the herm. The maenad on the right decorates the herm with garlands which she draws from the basket carried by a young boy. Both are attended by musicians - a male trumpeter to the left and a female timbrel player on the right. Directly to the left of the herm a female figure carries a deer on her shoul der - no doubt alluding to the sacrificial role of this animal in Dionysian mythology. Beneath the maenad on the right another satyr attempts to raise a fallen goat-legged figure (one of the panes of Greek mythology), whose limp physique and closed 4.

Directly beneath the herm we see a maenad clutching the hair of another goat-legged figure who is clearly struggling (unsuccessfully) to pull her down. The features of this hybrid figure suggest that he is Pan. The unconventional and unexpected relationship between these two figures is a key element in the interpretation of this work. All the figures are contained within a rectangle exactly half the height of the overall painting which is placed a third of its overall height from the bottom of the canvas. The angles of bodies and limbs of the various figures are linked through larger triangular forms related to the proportions of this rectangle. Thus Poussin manages to articulate brilliantly a sense of energy, dynamism and movement without losing control of an overall underlying harmony and structure - a real tour de force in the history of this kind of painting. In this rigorously interlocking design, he achieves a strik ing balance of opposing diagonals, carefully controlled through prominent vertical motifs amongst the figures and trees in the background, all of which are anchored by the dominant horizon tal frieze-like arrangement of the figures themselves, undoubt edly inspired by the sculptural cycles on Roman sarcophagi. One such frieze that springs to mind - which expresses a similar vitality and energy - is the Dionysian procession of musicians, satyrs, panes and so on, represented on the sarcophagus from the Villa Doha Pamphili [Fig. 5], A pen and wash copy of this frieze exists in the Cassiano dal Pozzo collection at Windsor [Fig. 6].3 The tightly organised composition reflects the idea of order that was so important in Poussin's thinking, as suggested in his statement that, 'My nature compels me to seek and love things that are well ordered, fleeing confusion, which is as contrary and inimical to me as is day to the deepest night'.4 235</page><page sequence="6">Brendan Cole 5.

However, there is an apparent misinterpretation of classical sources used to are aspects of the herm in the Triumph of Pan that cannot be explain the red 'face' of the herm (overlooking the fact that it is accounted for if it represents Priapus.

Blunt offers the translation, 'cheeks likely that it refers to Priapus, so in this regard it is more obvi- incarnadined with blood of elderberries and vermillion dye', even ously aligned with the iconography of Pan. But it is also clearly though the original text does not indicate that it is the 'cheeks' evident that the horns represented here are not entirely like the that are red; in fact no such part of the anatomy is mentioned. 239</page><page sequence="10">Brendan Cole :g.'4 ,y , vy. 9{r %.yy , s._ , \ «- / ^ , jy tys^) a M y _ 'rllr v \ l.y W %.jr£m sm&amp;Y ^-^^m^mSw-Zm obt? •; " X Y (■ / ' /• r'YYvk.J fci 10.

But one has the definite impression that Poussin, with 240</page><page sequence="11">The Mask of Dionysus. A Reinterpretation of Poussin's Triumph of Pan his meticulous attention to detail, would not create an image that was confused or lacking in scholarly awareness; the details of the herm are too specific to be discounted as artistic fancy. His association with the antiquarians of the Barberini court is well known, and he would surely paint with a view to displaying his erudition amongst his scholarly contemporaries. The well documented references to innumerable sources from ancient sarcophagi present in his Triumph are surely evidence of this. The seriousness of Poussin's approach was already empha sised by Bellori, who recorded that the Bacchanals were 'based on the study of ancient marbles and on mythological inventions produced by his most blessed genius'.17 Many of the figures and accoutrements in the Triumph were undoubtedly based on copies made by Poussin - and by other artists in Cassiano dal Pozzo's antiquarian circle - from ancient reliefs of Dionysian ceremonies.18 Poussin was no doubt able to access the exten sive record of works in his patron's famous Museo Cartaceo. Dionysian scenes were, of course, a common theme of antique sarcophagi and these were widely illustrated in the collection.19 Poussin's sketches after the antique attest to his interest in Greek and Roman sculpture and figurative vase painting - several of the drawings include copies of Bacchanalia and episodes from the life of Dionysus taken from Roman sarcophagi and antique friez es; details of these find their way into his paintings. For instance, the trumpeter to the right of the Uffizi study for the Triumph [Fig. 8] is identical (but in reverse) to the trumpeter in a pen and bis tre copy of a frieze representing a Bacchanal with Silenus and Bacchus, now in the Musée de Besançon [Fig. 9]20. This same motif is seen in another pen and bistre drawing of a Bacchanal Scene from the Borghese Vase (Paris, Musée du Louvre, Figs 10 11 ' "Ttle borghese Vase», first century BC, Pentelicus marble, . .. . . - , . h. 1.72 m, diam. 1.35 m, Paris, Louvre (MR 985; Ma 86) and 11); in this version the musician carries an animal pelt, much like the player in the final version of the Triumph,21 The Medici and Borghese Vases and others like them, such as the Dionysian vase It will be seen further on that motifs from these vases do, by Salpion (Naples, Museo Nazionale), were particularly noted indeed, find their way into his Triumph of Pan.

The deer pelt on the herm in the Triumph This attribute is also emphasised by de Vigenère in Les Images, makes this identification less persuasive, where he quotes Philostratus's remark regarding the Dionysian The lightly dappled pelt covering the herm in the Triumph is 'peax de Cerfs'48 and associates these with the sun and the heav- most certainly the fawn skin of Dionysus.

I think it is significant that he depicted this trumpeting satyr - and especially the association between Dionysus and the sun - wearing the deer pelt rather than the more orthodox panther pelt is also apparent in the symbol of the gilded horns (and torso) of (as is commonly depicted in ancient statuary) in order to retain an the herm, discussed below. emphatic association with Dionysus (rather than Pan or Priapus).

In paintings, this limbs torn from the sacrificial deer, and variations of this trope pelt is distinguished by its leopard spots or rosettes. Poussin are commonly seen in antique sculpture [Figs 26 and 27], In fact depicted a leopard pelt of this kind in highly precisionist detail in Poussin copied a thyrsus-carrying maenad with the severed torso his Triumph of Bacchus, where it is worn by the maenad riding of a deer that resembles closely the maenad on a marble plaque on the back of the male centaur in the foreground. A shaggy from the Louvre, which might have served as a model for this leopard's pelt is also depicted flung over a branch in his Nymph drawing [Fig. 28].51 Curiously, he also included this motif in his with Satyr Drinking (Moscow, Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts).

A Reinterpretation of Poussin's Triumph of Pan The motif of the goat is, of course, conspicuously evident in Poussin's Triumph in the presence of the two goats upon which the maenads are seated. The association of the goat and Pan is well known; what it slightly less obvious, but no less impor tant, is the fact that this animal is also associated with Dionysus himself and appears in descriptions of his earliest childhood, where he is turned into a baby goat by Zeus to escape Hera's wrath. Pseudo-Apollodorus gives a good account of this episode: 'Zeus loosened the stitches and gave birth to Dionysus, whom he entrusted to Hermes. Hermes took him to Ino and Athamas, and persuaded them to bring him up as a girl. Incensed, Hera inflicted madness on them. As for Zeus, he escaped Hera's anger by changing Dionysus into a baby goat. Hermes took him to the Nymphai of Asian Nysa, whom Zeus in later times places among the stars and named the Hyades'.52 Later, when Dionysus fled from Typhon (Typhoeus), he changed himself into a goat. Antoninus recorded that, 'Typhon [...] felt an urge to usurp the rule of Zeus and not one of the gods could withstand him as he 23' JJcp°^s fjjjjjjdetail from the "TriumPh attacked. In panic they fled to Aigyptos [Egypt], all except Athena and Zeus, who alone were left. Typhon hunted after them, on their track.

For instance, the ivy clusters forming a crown are the clear mark of Dionysos, Another feature of this figure that distinguishes it from the herms even if the workmanship is poor; and a horn just springing from in his other works - and which raises questions about its identity the temples reveals Dionysos, and a leopard, though but just - concerns the gilded horns. The manner in which these horns visible, is a symbol of the god'.58 De Vigenère comments on this are articulated in the Triumph is distinctly different from that seen passage in a chapter on the image of Ariadne in Les Images.59 in the herms in earlier paintings. For example, the herm in the His commentary also refers to the relevant Orphic hymns and Bacchanalian Revel has typical goat horns, shaped identically to other classical authors on the subject. But he goes further, to those used by Poussin in his description of satyrs and Pan drawing together the symbolism of the horns with rays of light; (seen in this image), where the horns are splayed and twisted the light symbolically suggested as gilding in Poussin's paint forward and have a rippled surface.

This attribute is implied in the Orphic hymn to Trietericus, it is far more likely that they reflect Poussin's precise erudition, which refers to Dionysus as 'golden-rayed'.65 The suggestion that I believe that these motifs, more than any other, reinforce the argu the gilded horns in The Triumph might be Poussin's idiosyncratic ment that the herm represents Dionysus. This is especially likely version of bull horns rather than goat horns is, therefore, entirely when they are examined in the light of Pausanias's Description of reasonable.

A Reinterpretation of Poussin's Triumph of Pan a particular instance of Dionysian worship in his Description of Greece. Here he describes statues representing the deity that are iconographically, and perhaps symbolically, identical to the one seen in Poussin's painting. Pausanias, notably, refers to them as having red faces and gilded bodies: The things worthy of mention in the city include the extant remains of antiquity, but the greater number of them belong to the period of its second ascendancy. On the market-place, where most of the sanctuaries are, stand Artemis surnamed Ephesian and wooden images of Dionysus, which are covered with gold with the exception of their faces; these are ornamented with red paint [...] as the Corinthians say, the Pythian priestess com manded them by an oracle to discover that tree and to worship it equally with the god. For this reason they have made these images from the tree.71 Poussin, of course, alters the red face and turns it into a mask. As regards the gilded torso, one recalls contemporary accounts of Dionysus, already mentioned, where he is associ ated with the sun. This is especially emphasised by Conti, who reminds us that, 'Some ancient writers thought that Bacchus represented the Sun', and proceeds to quote from Vergil's Georgics, the Bacchic verses of Eumolpus and the Hymns of Orpheus, all cited above, to demonstrate this. From the Hymns he cites the lines, 'Bright sun, whom they call by the epithet Dionysus'.72 De Vigenère's commentary on Philostratus's description of the image of Ariadne discusses this attribute of Dionysus as well.73 The gilded torso (and horns) is an obvi ous association with solar symbolism and it is likely that this is what Poussin had in mind in his rendering of the gilded herm. This association might also explain the conjunction of Bacchus and the sun in some of the paintings by Poussin - notably his _. . , _ , , .1 i .. x.i,* j 27. «Maenad», from a sarcophagus frieze in the Necropolis, Tyre Triumph of Bacchus, where the chariot of Helios is seen draw- K M ^ ' ing across the sky in the distance, echoing the chariot drawn by Bacchus on earth.74 Priapus, there is a case to be made here that it represents a spe Dionysus, the Anthesteria and the Festival cific celebration associated with the cult of Dionysus - namely Of Flowers the ancient Athenian festival known as the Anthesteria.

Poussin's meticu lous planning for this painting is evident in the eleven preparatory draw ings that exist for it - more than for any other painting he produced. As Verdi remarked: 'These show Poussin gradually forging the remarkable unity of the final canvas by a process of trial and error. Though at times almost painful to witness, such struggles attest to the artist's tenacious quest for perfection in his finished paintings' (R. Verdi and R Rosen berg, Nicolas Poussin 1594-1665, London, 1995, p. 203). 2 See M. Bull, The Mirror of the Gods, Classical Mythology in Renaissance Art, London, 2005, p. 234. 3 This is no doubt a typical example of antique sculpture which would have been familiar to Poussin - either in the original or from the dal Pozzo collection.

Bull cites the following from the Epinicia musarum: 'Antiquis habitus saeclis Pan pastore, et idem | Pastorum princeps maximus, atque Deus. | Pastor es, atque tuae similis quos purpura vestit, | Pasto rum titulos, munera, nomen habent', Epinicia musarum eminentissimo cardinali duci de Richelieu, Paris, 1634, p. 70. 12 Wine, The Seventeenth Century French Paintings, p. 361. 13 Blunt, Nicolas Poussin, pp. 141 ff. However, the traditional image of Priapus, apart from his distorted appendage, is of a figure carrying fruit in his lifted shirt - thus revealing his genitals. The figure to the left in the Sacrifice of Priapus conforms exactly to this trope (although with genitals modestly concealed) and it is likely therefore that Priapus is not the herm after all in this image, but the portly figure to the left. 14 The herms of Priapus in Italy were usually painted red, and were there fore referred to as ruber or rubicundus. See also Ovid, Fasti, 6. 319 and 333. 15 Blunt provides the references but does not cite the actual passages in his text (Blunt, Nicolas Poussin, p. 143). 16 It is true that statues of these deities were painted red, and it is perhaps surprising that Blunt did not note that this was a common description of Pan. 17 Giovan Pietro Bellori, The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects, trans.

Sacchetti brought Poussin to the attention of Cardinal Francesco Bar berini and through him he came into contact with Cassiano dal Pozzo. Dal Pozzo would become Poussin's devoted patron for the next twenty years. Bellori, Poussin's biographer, recorded that Poussin maintained that he had received his real training from dal Pozzo's Museo Cartaceo and at his house. See E. Cropper and Ch.

Keazor, Nicolas Poussin, 1594-1665, London, 2007, p. 11. 30 The placing of this drawing in the sequence of studies for the Triumph is problematic. It is often assumed to be a working copy of the painting done after the work was completed, but there are significant details in this drawing that differ from the final work, so this would negate this claim. These details include: the fruit in the basket at left, which is absent in the final work; the 'goat' to the left is a ram in the drawing, changed to a goat in the final painting; the female nymph riding the ram is naked in the drawing but fully clothed in the final work; the animal carried to sacrifice behind is a goat in the drawing, changed to a deer in the final work; the genitals of the herm are exposed in the drawing, but covered in the final painting; the male satyr in the foreground has a kerchief around his right ankle in the drawing (similar to the figures in the Sacrifice of Priapus by the Master of the Die); the fallen satyr clutches a wine bowl in the drawing, which stands on its own in the final painting; the little satyr grasps his ankle whereas his hand is beneath the knee in the final painting; there is no urn at the bottom right in the drawing, as seen in the final painting. If the drawing was done as a copy of the final painting, there would be evidence of this in the painting in the form of pentimenti, which would reveal these original details that were later absent. There is no evidence of this as yet, although Wine does indicate other pentimenti not related to details in the original draw ing. Another more radical idea would suggest that this is indeed a copy of the final work but that these pentimenti exist elsewhere, i.e. in one of the 'copies' of this work. However, assuming that the National Gallery version is indeed the original, one has to conclude that the Windsor drawing was finished just before the final painting was completed. 31 Orphic Hymn 52, to Trietericus. 32 Philostratus, Imagines, 2. 17, trans.

This image of a fawn-clad statue of Dionysus is reminiscent of Callistratus's description of an ancient statue of Dionysus by Praxiteles: On the statue of Dionysos [...]. The hands of Praxiteles wrought works of art that were altogether alive. There was a grove, and in it stood Dionysos in the form of a young man, so delicate that the bronze was transformed into flesh, with a body so supple and relaxed that it seemed to consist of some different material instead of bronze: for though it was really bronze, it nevertheless blushed, and though it had no part in life, it sought to show the appearance of life and would yield to the very finger-tip if you touched it, for though it was really compact bronze, it was so sof tened into flesh by art that it shrank from the contact of the hand. It had the bloom of youth, it was full of daintiness, it melted with desire, as indeed Euripides represented him when he fashioned his image in the Bakkhai. A wreath of ivy encircled his head - since the bronze was in truth ivy, bent as it was into sprays and holding up the curly locks which fell in profusion from his fore head. And it was full of laughter, nay, it wholly passed the bounds of wonder in that the material gave out evidence of joy and the bronze feigned to represent the emotions. A fawn-skin clothed the statue, not such as Dionysos was accustomed to wear, but the bronze was transformed to imitate the pelt; and he stood resting his left hand on a thyrsos, and the thyrsos deceived the 270</page><page sequence="41">The Mask of Dionysus.

The eye was gleam ing with fire, in appearance the eye of a man in a frenzy; for the bronze exhibited the Bakkhic madness and seemed to be divinely inspired, just as, I think, Praxiteles had the power to infuse into the statue also the Bakkhic ecstasy.

Thus he is spoken of as 'cow-born', 'bull', 'bull-shaped', 'bull-faced', 'bull-browed', 'bull-horned', 'horn-bearing', 'two horned', 'horned'. He was believed to appear, at least occasion ally, as a bull. His images were often, as at Cyzicus, made in bull shape, or with bull horns; and he was painted with horns. Types of the horned Dionysus are found amongst the surviving monu ments of antiquity. On one statuette he appears clad in a bull's hide, the head, horns, and hoofs hanging down behind. (J. G. Frazer, The Golden Bough, New York, 1922, Chapter 43, 'Dionysus'). 55 Orphic Hymn 52, to Trietericus. 56 Orphic Hymn 30, to Dionysus. There is little reference to Dionysus having gilded horns apart from the description of his golden drinking horn: in Horace we read: '[...] quamquam, choreis aptior et iocis | ludoque dictus, non sat idoneus | pugnae ferebaris; sed idem | pacis eras mediusque belli. | Te uidit insons Cerberus aureo | cornu decorum leniter atterens | caudam et recedentis trilingui | ore pedes tetigitque crura'.

One also recalls the conception of Dionysus in the Dionysiaca, when Zeus enters Semele's chamber imitating, amongst other animals associated with Dionysus, a bull: Now he leaned over the bed, with a horned head on human limbs, lowing with the voice of a bull, the very likeness of bull horned Dionysos. Again, he put on a shaggy lion's form; or he was a panther, as one who begets a bold son, driver of pan thers and charioteer of lions. Again, as a young bridegroom he bound his hair with coiling snakes and vine-leaves intertwined, and twisted purple ivy about his locks, the plaited ornament of Bacchos. A writhing serpent crawled over the trembling bride and licked her rosy neck with gentle lips, then slipping into her bosom girdled the circuit of her firm breasts, hissing a wedding tune, and sprinkled her with sweet honey of the swarming bees instead of the viper's deadly poison. Zeus made long wooing, and shouted 'Euoi!' as if the winepress were near, as he begat his son who would love the cry. He pressed love-mad mouth to mouth, and beaded up delicious nectar, an intoxicating bedfel low for Semele, that she might bring forth a son to hold the sceptre of nectareal vintage. As a presage of things to come, he lifted the careforgetting grapes resting his laden arm on the firebringing fennel; or again, he lifted a thyrsus twined about with purple ivy, wearing a deerskin on his back - the lovesick wearer shook the dappled fawnskin with his left arm.

Colonel Famin gives a succinct description of this bas-relief in the following: The bas-relief which has furnished the subject of the above expla nation is a good representation of a Dionysiac or Bacchanal. In the centre is the old Silenus, crowned with ivy, carrying a cup in one hand, and in the other a crown, the emblem of his Victory over the drinkers. He staggers and would certainly fall to the ground 271</page><page sequence="42">Brendan Cole but for two young fauns who support him. A Lampadophor [lamp bearer] and a Canephor [flower basket bearer] are behind him. To his left may be perceived, in order of succession, a Bacchante, a female cymbal-player, a young boy carrying some of the instru ments of initiation, an immodest phallophore fixing his strap, a female Satyr placing the pedum and the syrinx at the feet of Bacchus-Hermes, who may be recognised by his horns and by the stag's skin which envelopes his chest. In the corner appears the god Cupid, who seems to have come to take part in the festi val. To the left of Silenus is a small altar, and on it a pine-apple, and a lighted torch has been prepared for the Sacrifice. A Bacchante, lying on a bear-skin, reclines voluptuously in an attitude which leaves but little doubt as to the cause of her exhaustion. In the background appears a Satyr, who, attracted by the noise, leaves his dwelling in order to share in the orgy. Finally, at the extremity of the bas-relief, a woman in the disguise of a Satyr places herself on the attribute of a Priapus-Hermes. The scene takes place in a forest, where may be seen several oaks and a palm-tree. 69 Malcolm Bull notes that Giraldi's book is 'the most scholarly of its kind - the first to make full use of ancient historians and geographers like Pausanias, whose Description of Greece provided a wealth of informa tion about the ways in which the gods had been worshiped in their sanctuaries', Bull, The Mirror of the Gods, p. 23. 70 Philostratus: Les Images ou tableaux de platte-peinture, traduction et commentaire de Blaise de Vigenère, tome 1, présenté et annoté par F. Graziani, Paris, 1995, p. 233. The description is taken from Pausa nias, Description of Greece, 2. 7. 5 (although Graziani cites the source as Desc. Graec. I, xx, 3): [2. 7. 5] On the modern citadel is a sanctuary of Fortune of the Height, and after it one of the Dioscuri. Their images and that of Fortune are of wood. On the stage of the theater built under the citadel is a statue of a man with a shield, who they say is Aratus, the son of Cleinias. After the theater is a temple of Dionysus. The god is of gold and ivory, and by his side are Bacchanals of white marble. These women they say are sacred to Dionysus and mad dened by his inspiration. The Sicyonians have also some images which are kept secret. These one night in each year they carry to the temple of Dionysus from what they call the Cosmeterium (Tiring-room), and they do so with lighted torches and native hymns. [2. 7. 6] The first is the one named Baccheus, set up by Andro damas, the son of Phlias, and this is followed by the one called Lysius (Deliverer), brought from Thebes by the Theban Phanes at the command of the Pythian priestess. Phanes came to Sicy on when Aristomachus, the son of Cleodaeus, failed to under stand the oracle given him, and therefore failed to return to the Peloponnesus. As you walk from the temple of Dionysus to the market-place you see on the right a temple of Artemis of the lake. A look shows that the roof has fallen in, but the inhabitants cannot tell whether the image has been removed or how it was destroyed on the spot. 71 Pausanias, Description of Greece, 2. 2. 6-7. And elsewhere: [2. 30. 1] XXX. There are three temples close together, one of Apollo, one of Artemis, and a third of Dionysus. Apollo has a naked wooden image of native workmanship, but Artemis is dressed, and so, too, is Dionysus, who is, moreover, represent ed with a beard. The sanctuary of Asclepius is not here, but in another place, and his image is of stone, and seated. 72 Conti, Mythologiae, op. cit.

Hamilton, Choes and Anthesteria (1992). Anthesteria, at Athens, an important festival, lasting three days, of the god Dionysus, which gave its name to the month Anthes terion (February-March), signifying the time of year when the flowers (anth) begin to appear. It was the custom to garland with flowers children who were 3 years old, and children participated in the festival, perhaps because Dionysus was in some aspects the god of life and growth. As he was also god of wine, wine was much in evidence; the first day was the pithoigia, 'jar-opening', when the new wine was tasted and offered at the shrine of Diony sus in the Marshes, en limnais (the marshes which were the home of the Frogs in Aristophanes' comedy of that name). The second day was called khos, 'wine-jugs', the khous being a type of pot with a wide curving belly, short neck, and trefoil mouth, numbers of which survive in miniature form, having evidently been given to children as presents. Much drinking took place, and there was a procession in which Dionysus (perhaps personi fied by a masked actor) was borne along on a ship mounted on wheels, and was supposed to 'marry' the wife of the archon basi leus. At the end of Aristophanes' Acharnians the hero Dikaiopolis prepares to celebrate the feast of the wine-jugs while the general Lamachus has to go off to war. The third day was called khytroi, 'pots', in which a mixture of all kinds of vegetables was boiled and offered to the god Hermes Chthonios, 'of the Underworld', on behalf of the dead, to placate their hostility. It was a day of ill omen, when the spirits of the dead (keres) were thought to roam the city. At the end of the day they were banished with the cry, 'Be gone, keres, the Anthesteria are over!'

Raffan, Oxford, 1985, p. 240. In a commentary to the vase in Fig. 48, Arias writes: What is taking place? This vase together with a number of others all showing what is evidently the same rite performed in honour of Dionysus in front of his mask-image have been the subject of much controversy. Are they to be connected with the Athe nian winter festival of the Lenaea, celebrated in January with rites which may, as the name Lenai (= menads) suggests, have been orgiastic in nature but about which we know nothing at all unless we actually ascribe these pictures to this very rite - and this opinion has been defended notably by Frickenhaus, the first scholar to treat these vases systematically, and by Deubner - or do we have here, as Nilsson in particular has argued repeatedly, a representation of a ceremony we know from the statement of a fourth century BC Athenian writer to have taken place every year during the spring festival of the Anthesteria (Phanodemus quoted by Athenaeus, XI, p. 465 A)? During this festival which was celebrated at the very beginning of March or late February, the newly opened wine of last year's vintage was brought by the Athenians to the sanctuary of Dionysus 'in the Marshes', the Limnaion (situated probably due west of the Acropolis just south of the Areopagus hill) to be mixed there with water and conse crated to the god before it was fit for drinking. 'Anthropology has collected endless examples of such consecration of the fruits of field, orchard or vineyard, whereby the taboo is taken off the food of the community before they dare to enjoy it' (Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States, V, p. 215). Our knowledge of these fes tivals is very sketchy and largely based upon such disconnected scraps of information as chance has preserved. The efforts of scholars to build up a coherent picture though heroic may in fact be misleading. Anyhow the vase representations if, as we must, we consider the series as a whole, do not in fact agree entirely with either of the festival ceremonies as reconstructed by modern scholarship. It is very likely that what is shown is indeed a 'consecration of wine' in front of the mask-image of Dionysus (why else should the stamnos be so prominent in so many of the pictures), yet the occasion is one for women only, women who are acting as menads, albeit peculiar menads since we do not ordinarily expect menads to make the mixing, drawing or drink ing of wine their main occupation. As our plates show, menads may serve as ministers to Dionysus and bring wine (so on plates 89; 43 top), they may rather less frequently be seen holding the kantharos or skyphos on their own account, but they never make drinking their main and only business. An exception to this rule is the menad Kraipale on a well-known oinochoe in Boston (00 352) but the occasion there may have been specially privileged if the allusion is really to the Anthesteria; see Caskey-Beazley, II, p. 93, no. 11 z. Nor is there evidence that in actual life the ecstatic worshippers of Dionysus used wine as the prime inducer of excite ment. In the most realistic picture of ecstasy set in actual life that we have from the fifth century B.C., the Spina volute-krater of the Group of Polygnotos (Beazley, ARFVR p. 696, no. 23; Alfieri, Arias and Hirmer, Spina, pi. 74-81), no wine, no cup, no vessel is in evidence. Music, drums and dance are sufficient. (R E. Arias, A History of Greek Vase Painting, trans. B. B. Shefton, London, 1962, p. 373). 85 J.

References to olives and olive branches are present in classical texts relating to Dionysus, but none (so far as I am currently aware) can be used to identify this female revel ler in the context of a specific Dionysian rite. 1071 am not suggesting that Poussin would have seen this vase as it was probably not known in the seventeenth century. The resemblance, how ever, is certainly worth recording. 108Nonnos, Dionysiaca, 12. 330ff. Nonnos relates a further incident as follows: 'Another dragged back a struggling mystic maiden while kin dling the torch for the god's nightly dances, laid timid fingers upon her bosom and pressed the swelling circle of her firm breast' (ibid.). This fondling episode is articulated almost identically in the Windsor draw ing, where a figure sits astride a goat on the left, her exposed breasts clearly in the clutches of the male celebrant behind. In the Triumph and elsewhere, Poussin was clearly at pains to eliminate, as far as possible, any imagery that related to the drunkenness and debauchery com monly associated with traditional Bacchanalia. 109The garland is lightly painted in and may have been added much later. It can be contrasted with the much more highly articulated garland of olive branches that is worn by the young boy carrying the basket of flowers to the right. The relationship between these two figures opens into wider issues regarding the relationship between men and women generally in Poussin's paintings. The theme of the passive or submis sive male in Poussin's work was already celebrated by his contempo raries and noted in a poem by Hilaire Pader entitled 'Des Amants', from La Peinture parlante (1653), as follows: When [Poussin] paints a Lover resting his head on his lady's breast, It is as if [the Lover] is, quite truly, dying and giving up his soul: The look of pleasure is so strong in his languishing eyes That only the ignorant, unseeing, can fail to see it. [...] In front of this painting, Envy, affected strangely Turns away from its black poison to proclaim its praise, And [Poussin's] winged infants who descend from Heaven Make all its bitterness as sweet as honey. (Toulouse: Colomiez, 1653), pp. 21-22: 'Lors qu'il peint un Amant sur le sein de sa dame, | On dirait, sans mentir, qu'il expire &amp; rend l'Ame: | L'aise parest si fort dedans ses yeux mourants | Qu'il ne se peut cach er qu'a ceux des ignorants. | [...] L'envie en cét endroit par un effet estrange | Quittant son noir venin publie sa louange; | Et ses enfants aisles qui descendent du Ciel | Rendent tout son absinthe aussi dous que le miel'. Translation supplied by Russell Goulbourne and Elizabeth L'Estrange. I am indebted to Phillipa Plock for pointing this out to me and supplying the poem and translation. These ideas are developed in her dissertation, Regarding Gendered Mythologies: Nicolas Poussin's Mythological Paintings and Practices of Viewing in Seventeenth-Century Rome (unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Leeds, 2004). There is a burgeoning literature that deals with Poussin's imagery of pas sive men. See for example the chapter on Mars and Venus in E. Cropper and Ch. Dempsey, Nicolas Poussin: Friendship and the Love of Painting, Princeton, 2000; and R. Michel, Posséder et détruire, exh. cat., Louvre, Paris, 2000. 110 Vergil, Georgics, 2. f. 111 Poussin's interest in Stoicism, with its emphasis on the control of pas sions, is discussed in Blunt, Nicolas Poussin, p. 157ff. This might be an overstated interpretation of this motif, and one could be more prosaic in arguing that the satyr is simply showing no interest in the maenad and is merely attempting to wrestle from her the bowl of wine which she keeps to herself. 112 See Blunt, Nicolas Poussin, p. 1 to. 113 See Wine, The Seventeenth "Century French Paintings (n. 5 above), p. 358. Hilliard T. Goldfarb claims that these works were acquired in 1631. See Richelieu: Art and Power, ed. by H. T. Goldfarb, exh. cat. Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal, 2002, p. 291. 114See Wine, ibid., and note 64 on p. 364. 115 As the Triumph and the Bacchus were probably installed at the same time it is very likely that they were part of an integrated programme. Both share visual and iconographical features, but it would appear that the Triumph is a treatment of the Greek Dionysus whereas the Bacchus is clearly derivative of the Roman god. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper, one could probably demonstrate that these works expressed aspects of the myth that were of interest to Richelieu reflecting the wider spectrum of attributes associated with the theme of Dionysus/Bacchus - particularly as this subject was so intimately connected with his château and its decorative scheme (see note 104 above). 116 See Wine, The Seventeenth Century French Paintings, p. 360. 117 See E.
