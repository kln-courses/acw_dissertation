<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION AND EXCAVATION IN PALESTINE, TRANSJORDAN AND SYRIA DURING 19381 Despite the continuation of serious political disturbances in Palestine during the year, impor- tant archaeological work was accomplished. We mourn the loss of James Llewellyn Starkey of Lachish, who was murdered by Arab bandits. His staff carried on courageously after his death and completed the season. Since then vandals have destroyed the entire camp by fire. PALESTINE: EARLY HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY The Pontifical Biblical Institute, Rome-Jeru- salem, under the direction of Father Kippel con- ducted an eighth season of excavations at Tuleil t Ghassil.2 The work lasted from January 1 to March 1, 1938. Further work was done in the eastern half of the 100 by 50 m. section of tell 3, on which attention has been concentrated since 1932. Going down by successive layers of 20 cm. each, the excavations have now reached a level of 3 m. below the top of the mound. In strips A, B, and C, special care was devoted to a large number of animal bones. Most frequent among these are bones of pigs. Remains of wall paintings were again found in layers II and III, but so far nothing like a complete composition has been dis- covered. Further, a copper hook turned up in an excellent stratigraphic context and was handed over to the Palestine Archaeological Museum for analysis. No tin was found in it. This object once more confirms the view that the term "Neolithic" cannot be applied to the culture of the Ghassulian settlement. It should be qualified as "Middle Chalcolithic," on the assumption that Megiddo V-VII, Beisan XV-XVIII, and Jericho VIII represent the upper Chalcolithic. Additional information is now available besides that published last year in this JOURNAL,3 with regard to the excavations carried out at 'Affuileh in the plain of Esdraelon in March, 1937, by Dr. E. L. Sukenik on behalf of the Hebrew Univer- sity. The excavations were near the water-tower by the railway station. When the foundations for this tower were dug in 1931, some grey burnished sherds were found.4 Pits sunk in the vicinity during 1937 revealed the presence of a Chalco- lithic settlement. This settlement subsequently moved to the present tell, situated near the Jerusalem-Haifa road. The older site was then used as a necropolis, and as time passed, tombs from various ages were dug in the earlier deposits, which were consequently much disturbed. An undisturbed, stratified area, however, was found on the tell. There the excavations revealed under the grey burnished ware a number of Tuleilat Ghass1l sherds in a stratum which reached down to virgin soil. Above this stratum were two floors made of black beaten earth, one above the other; on the lower floor was a hearth, bedded in a layer of grey burnished sherds. Tuleilat Ghassil is situated on the northeastern side of the Dead Sea. It is seen then definitely that the Ghassulian culture preceded that of the age of grey burnished ware and that it extended as far as the plain of Esdraelon. To the Ghassulian phase of the 'AffiAleh site belong remains of structures which were built of crude, plano-convex bricks, baked and unbaked, in which traces of finger-impres- sions of the brick-makers can still be seen. It was impossible to ascertain the plan of the structures. Excavations were conducted at Tell el-'Ajj1il near Gaza, on behalf of the British School of 1 The writer wishes to thank Mr. W. A.

Mackay and Dr. M. A. Murray, members of Sir Flinders Petrie's staff. The portion of the site which was excavated was a continuation of the Hyksos town previously found by Sir Flinders Petrie. Remains of streets and houses were un- covered. In these were many burials of the Bronze Age. All yielded a certain amount of pottery, and a few yielded also gold and silver jewellery, in the shape of butterfly earrings, twisted earrings, tog- gle-pins, etc. A hoard of the precious metals was found, the objects being of the same type as the hoards published by Petrie in Ancient Gaza IV. A horse-burial of a type that suggests a sacrifice was discovered. The model excavations at Tell ed-Duweir 1 on behalf of the Wellcome-Marston Archaeological Research Expedition were continued for most of the season under the direction of the late J. L. Starkey, and then under the direction of C. H. Inge, with L. Harding acting as adviser. The eastern face of the Palace Fort was exposed along its entire length of 210 feet, down to the level of the white plastered court. Built up against the massive foundation courses of the Palace Fort was a row of poorly constructed houses. The floors were covered with thick ash, and among the pot- tery in the charred debris, the greater part of a water-jar was found, on which a jotting or receipt had been written in the manner of the Samaria ostraca. Not much is legible, but the first words are clearly "In the ninth (year)"; a comparison with Jeremiah XXXIX, 1 has been suggested. The topmost stones of the Palace steps had been incorporated in the floors of these makeshift houses above, and on their removal, ten steps of the flight in use until the time of the Babylonian attack of 597 B.c. were recovered. The Palace Fort was not rebuilt after the initial burning, and there was therefore no need to replace the steps. They themselves had replaced an earlier flight, in use probably ca. 700-600 B.C., and of which only the two topmost steps have been exposed. On the vertical face of the upper ones are scratched drawings of a lion and other objects, and in the corner some schoolboy has written the first five letters of the Hebrew-Phoenician alphabet, show- ing that the alphabet was studied in its conven- tional order as early as the seventh century B.C. At the base of the steps was a mud and stone podium, plastered over, which may have served as a mounting block. In front of them, against the Palace wall, was a curious "drum" of hard lime- stone, the upper surface of which was pitted with eight small depressions. Pere Vincent compares it to a similar stone at Mallia, in Crete. In one house, built against the east side of the Palace destroyed in 597 and attributed to the reign of Zedekiah, was found a jar, on the bottom of which a well executed drawing had been incised. It represents a pair of ibex eating a plant. Examination of the area within the city gate has progressed; a road runs into the city, flanked on each side by shops and houses, and an alley turns northward just inside the gate. The inner gate-tower was of brick, on stone foundations; two of the southern piers have been exposed. Between them three steps lead to a doorway (still un- excavated), which presumably gave access to the upper stories. A double-tiered bench fills the re- maining space. The raised cobbled threshold of the inner gate is intact and two grooves had been left, possibly to take the wooden beams on which the doors were set up (cf. Nehemiah III, 3). They were filled with ash. On either side of the gate were burnt houses. In the fallen debris of one of these houses was found the upper part of a jar, inscribed with the Hebrew letters b t m 1 k, show- ing that the jar held the capacity of a "bath." From the size of the jar it seems likely that the jars stamped with the 1 m 1 k seal on the handle also hold this amount. It is now established that the great pit south- east of the Palace Fort was never finished or put in use. Quarrying had proceeded further at the southern end, where there was a drop of some twelve feet, while in places the masons had only partially cut out great blocks of stone. At the northwest corner of the pit a boss of limestone had not been removed, owing to its harder nature, and some natural resemblance to a human head had encouraged the masons to increase the like- ness. It is possible that the great pit, approxi- mately 25 m. square, was constructed as a reser- voir, to replace an earlier water-system. The great open area, east of the Palace. Fort, would have formed an enormous catchment area drain- ing directly towards the shaft. A section adjoining the cemetery area, cleared during the preceding season, at the northeast cor- ner of the mound, was examined. It was honey- combed with cave dwellings of Early Bronze Age date and with later tomb chambers. One large cave showed on its walls the marks of the flint adzes used to enlarge the interior, and here a 1 PEFQ. 1938, pp. 240-256.</page><page sequence="3">148 NELSON GLUECK fine "hole-mouth" jar stood in position, practi- cally intact. Some caves had been re-used as dwelling places in the Iron Age II period, and a good selection of burnished vessels was found. An Iron Age burial in a well cut chamber pre- sented a chemical problem, as a black deposit had formed inside the sealed tomb and over an ex- tensive area outside, which could not have been caused by fire. Analysis showed it to be of organic nature, but the reason for its presence is still obscure. Finds on the saddle area, close to the camp- house, included an ostracon from the debris cov- ering the Iron Age roadway. It appears to be a list of names, followed by numerals. Two robbed tombs supplied fragments of at least three pottery coffins, of the "slipper" type. The lids were moulded to represent human features, and down the front of one was an inscription in hieroglyphs, badly imitated by a local scribe. The reading is uncertain, but a phrase "Waters of the west" is not disputed. Associated objects date this group to the XIXth Dynasty. An isolated discovery in the southern valley nearby consisted of fragments of an anthropomorphic vase, burnished, and painted in black and red. Work on the Temple area is at last complete. Only the west wall of the building, built on bed- rock, now remains. Elsewhere the early rubbish pits have been cleared and all soil removed from the bottom of the fosse. Some fine ceremonial vases were recovered, including a gigantic cook- ing-pot, a brazier and a polychrome vase with metopes of ibex, and ibis, and a tunny fish. The south face of the massive cross wall over the fosse, on which the antechamber rested, has been ex- posed. This wall was based on a rock ledge, left standing some two feet above the bottom of the moat. The results of the six seasons of excavations are now being prepared for publication under the direction of Lankester Harding. It is hoped to resume work at Lachish when publication of results to date is complete. A detailed report on the crania found in 1935-36 will shortly be avail- able. The Megiddo expedition of the Oriental Insti- tute of the University of Chicago again had a very successful campaign,1 under the direction of Gordon Loud. During the past season informa- tion was gained with regard to the first settlers on the site which commanded the main road between Egypt and Asia. Sections of the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age settlements were laid bare, and the bedrock on which the first inhabitants made their homes was exposed. Stratum XX, to which the earliest building period is assigned, lies im- mediately upon bedrock and employs in its frag- mentary architecture both the natural rock and crudely built stone walls. In this stratum were found decorated sherds, both incised and painted. Many of them suggest the Upper Neolithic of Jericho, but are mixed with true Chalcolithic specimens such as were found in the earliest stages in the Megiddo necropolis. This stratum is prob- ably to be assigned originally to an early phase of the Chalcolithic period, and is to be dated about the middle of the fourth millennium B.C. Stratum XIX is the work of a people already versed in architecture. A massive building was partly excavated. It had thick, well built walls of mud-brick upon single-coursed stone foundations, and presents a vivid contrast to the crude archi- tecture of Stratum XX. A wall 3 m. wide, extend- ing across the entire area, provides one side of a room containing what appears to be an altar, although no objects were found to validate this assumption. Originally the altar was rectangular, with the addition of a low shelf. Subsequently it was enlarged to an irregular shape. Flat stones were set into the floor at uneven intervals along both walls and down the center of the room. In front of this shrine building, a stone pavement sloped downward towards the edge of the mound, where it was destroyed by later construction. Upon many of the paving-stones are incised draw- ings of human and animal forms,2 forming a pic- ture gallery, so to speak, of art of the last half of the fourth millennium B.c. These drawings recall those scratched on pottery of Stage V of the Chalcolithic series excavated in 1932 on the east slope of the mound. This is evident in the pottery of Stratum XIX, in which Chalcolithic forms far outnumber Early Bronze wares. The Chalcolithic pottery contains numerous specimens of "cornet" shapes, recalling similar forms from Tuleilat Ghassil. The Megiddo specimens, however, are of much finer ware, and are invariably decorated with red lines. Such advanced decorative tech- nique as incised herringbone patterns enclosed by red paint is found upon bowl rims. A large and well preserved bronze sword was found in Stratum XIX. With Stratum XVIII, the architecture becomes 1 ILN. Nov. 19, 1938, pp. 926-929. 2 ILN. Nov. 26, 1938, p. 975.</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN PALESTINE, TRANSJORDAN AND SYRIA 149 even more massive. The city wall was originally 4 m. wide, and was subsequently doubled in width. When found, the wall was still 3.5 m. high, and originally must have been considerably higher. Structurally it resembles the great wall of contemporary Ai. Although there is to a certain extent a carry-over of Chalcolithic pottery-forms in this stratum, the predominant types are defi- nitely of Early Bronze I character. Flat, high- sided platters, with a tendency to red burnished washes, and metallic bowls with inturned rims and pattern burnishing are well in evidence. The first half of the third millennium B.C. may be tentatively assigned to this stratum. Stratum XVII had been dated, as a result of a previous season's work, to the period lasting ap- proximately to the end of the third millennium B.C. The new results tend to confirm the Early Bronze Age dating for this stratum. In the west extension of Stratum XVII there was uncovered a unique circular stone structure, the summit of which is approached by a flight of steps. There was an enclosing wall, not completely excavated, around it. The circular structure may possibly be a sacrificial altar in a shrine, as suggested by quantities of animal bones found about the base of the steps. Among the pottery-forms handmade or tournette-made platters, stump-based vessels, string-cut-base bowls, and vessels with pushed-up ledge handles predominate. The pottery is closely related to that of Stratum XVIII. Clearance of the Hyksos levels under the palace in the north area provides further evidence for the Middle Bronze sequence previously estab- lished throughout the corresponding strata in the east area. The city gate of Stratum XIII, about 1800 B.C., which, with the city wall of this level, is of mud-brick, lies under the palace. Before reaching the outer portal of the city gate, it jogs inward. Within the gate one must turn left to reach the inner portal, the axis of which is at a right angle to that of the outer portal. Excavations at Tell el-Kidudi 1 (Tell esh- Shfneh) were continued from January, 1938. till the middle of March by E. L. Sukenik, on behalf of the Hebrew University. Remains of a fortress, dated by pottery finds to the tenth-ninth centu- ries B.C., were unearthed. The fortress was built of dressed sandstone. Its remains consist of a line of construction, 7 m. wide, extending south- north for about 30 m., which turns at its north end to the west. From this point, the line of build- ing could be followed for about 6 m., the rest hav- ing been washed away by the sea. It is to be sup- posed that a parallel line existed also at the south end, but there is nothing left of it. Whether this structure was closed to the west, or open towards the sea, is a moot question. A number of square or rectangular chambers was found inside the structure flanking a central entrance at the west. They were preserved to a height of about 4 m. From the number of disintegrated bricks, it may be assumed that the upper courses were built of baked bricks. At some later date the structure was burnt, as is shown by a layer of ashes. The build- ing was then reinforced on the east side by a wall, 2.5 m. thick. A paved rampart sloping towards the east led up to the entrance of this build- ing. About (0 m. to the north of these ruins, the remains of a wall of the Persian period were found. In addition, the fragmentary ruins of some Byzantine houses, including a bath, were dis- covered. PALESTINE: LATE HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY Mr. T. J. Colin Baly, on behalf of the Colt Archaeological Expedition, undertook soundings at 'Auja el-Hafir, Isbeita and Khalasah, in south- western Palestine. A sounding was made at 'Auj5 el-Hafir in an attempt to find sequences in the pottery, fragments of which lie against the base of the fort there, and to compare the results with the new material obtained from Khalasah. No definite results were obtained. A certain amount of clearing and excavating was under- taken among three buildings lying outside the town limits of Isbeita. A circular building seems to have been a dove-cote. The two other buildings were farmhouses. In a field adjacent to one of these buildings was an irrigation system, which still requires study. The object of the season at Khalasah was to establish a sequence of pottery from Hellenistic to Arab times, particularly by opening up the largest dump on the site, northeast of the town proper. The dump, however, belonged entirely to the third to fourth centuries A.D. A careful sur- face examination and four additional soundings showed that all the dump heaps around the town must be similarly dated. The chief results of the season are: 1. A large amount of pottery was collected 1 AJA. xlii, 1938, p. 168.</page><page sequence="5">150 NELSON GLUECK which it should be possible to date between close limits from the many associated coins. 2. Contrary to accepted opinion, sand was a serious problem at Khalasah by the third century A.D. 3. Khalasah attained its greatest extent by the fourth century A.D. at the latest, after which its decline began. 4. The existence of a Hellenistic cemetery was established. In addition, a number of inscribed and decor- ated stones in possession of the modern inhab- itants was collected, eight of them being dated. One is a gravestone of 426-7 A.D., without any Christian symbols; the others are Christian grave- stones of 544-603 A.D. This group of inscribed gravestones forms the first representative collec- tion from the common cemetery of a southern Palestinian town. The work of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine, which during the last three years has been engaged, under the direction of D. V. Baramki, in excavating Kh. Mefjer,' an Omayyad palace 5 km. north of Jericho, is now completed. The palace is rectangular in plan, measuring 75 by 67 m. It is divided into four blocks, each constructed along the side of a square cloistered court. The walls are built of double stone facing with rubble filling, and are strengthened by round towers at the four corners, half-round towers in the middle of the north and west walls, and a square minaret in the middle of the south wall. The faqade of the palace, which is on the east side, consisted of two stories of arcades, the lower flanking the monumental gateway, while the up- per, with its white marble columns and carved stucco balustrade, formed an open loggia over- looking the cloistered atrium in front of the palace. The gateway is flanked by two square towers. It was roofed with a multifoil barrel vault, the outer voussoirs of which were decorated with a series of engaged fluted columns and Corinthian capitals radiating from the center of the arch. The entrance hall has two seats on each side, similar to those in the gateway. The seats are flanked and separated from each other by clusters of columns. The column shafts and the walls are decorated with carved stucco, most of which was found in the d2bris; it includes human, animal, floral, and geometrical motifs. Some parts have been reassembled. They include a panel of human busts, a semi-nude dancing girl, and a niche for a statue. The antipathy to representation of hu- man and animal designs in Islamic art arose after the period of the Omayyads. The writer finds a reflection of many Nabataean art motifs in Omayyad art. The hall had a barrel vault resting on four wall arches carried by the clusters of col- umns. The entrance hall leads into the spacious central court, measuring 28.95 by 27.73 m., through the east cloister. The court is surrounded on all sides by arcaded cloisters, the arches rest- ing on polished red marble columns carrying Cor- inthian capitals. An upper floor is now destroyed. In the south block is the mosque, containing one of the earliest known examples of a round mihrab, or prayer niche. The west block contained the residential quarter of the Caliph. The throne room occupied a hall in the center of the block. There was a subterranean bath-hall below the throne room, with a mosaic floor made up of squares diagonally set within a linear border. The walls of the rooms of the east block were decorated with painted frescoes. The motifs included human, animal, floral, and geometrical designs in natural colors. The date of the palace has been supplied by an inscribed marble fragment bearing the name of Caliph Hisham, who reigned from 724 to 743 A.D. The palace was never completed, having been destroyed by an earthquake in 746 A.D. The work was not resumed, because in 750 A.D. the Omayyad dynasty came to an abrupt end when the Abassids rose to power. They were not interested in completing an Omayyad monument. An expedition of the Goerresgesellschaft and Islamic Department, Staatliche Museen, Berlin, directed by Dr. Puttrich-Reignard, worked from November 1, 1937, to May 1, 1938, at Kh. Min- yeh, near the northwest end of the Lake of Galilee. Its principal aim was the clearance of the south- ern palace area, where the outlines of the build- ings had been ascertained during the previous year.2 No new discoveries were made as regards the general plan of the building, which consists of a mosque in the southeast corner with an arcaded room adjoining it and at the other end a marble hall (perhaps the throne room), and a group of five rooms. A few side rooms were dis- covered in the southwest corner. In the western group of buildings (which was connected with the southern palace), the only part excavated was a well preserved staircase on the south. The exist- 1 ILN.

M. Schneider. This year's campaign confirmed the conclusions of last year, namely, that the arcaded room was left unfinished by the builders. Only a few traces of the original sumptuous decoration of the mar- ble hall were left. The supports dividing the room into three naves have disappeared, with the excep- tion of one marble base. Even the marble slabs covering the floor and the walls had been ex- tracted and removed, only a few fragments being left. The excavators were therefore agreeably sur- prised to find an excellently preserved floor mosaic in the big central room of the five-room group. As in all mosaic pavements found on this site, the decoration of this mosaic is exclusively geometrical. A cleverly thought-out system of lozenges covers the central field, which is sur- rounded by several frieze-borders. The polychrome arrangement of the mosaic is especially charming, this result being obtained by the simultaneous em- ployment of glass and stone cubes. In the small northwest room another mosaic was found; it was, however, not quite complete. An investiga- tion of the inner side of the north wall of the fort led to the discovery of a further series of rooms. Additional excavation is required to uncover the contents of these rooms. Many small finds confirmed the results of the former excavations. The material from the top levels is almost exclusively mediaeval Arabic, belonging to the thirteenth and fourteenth cen- turies A.D., while the objects found in the lower levels, consisting mostly of unglazed pottery, can be regarded as early Islamic. The foundation of Kh. Minyeh in the early Islamic, Omayyad period is therefore not impossible in view of the evidence thus far collected; a definite conclusion must, however, depend on the results of future work. In order to ascertain the character of the strata below the fort level, a series of deep cuts and a sounding trench were made at the eastern part of the site, outside the fort. In all trenches, down to groundwater level, at 3 m. deep, there were found large quantities of thin, red, ribbed and unribbed ware. Mr. P. L. O. Guy has continued the archaeolog- ical survey of Palestine on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund and the British School of Archaeology, Jerusalem.1 Several trips were made in the Negeb which have resulted in the discovery of a number of unrecorded buildings, of which plans were made, and traces of ancient terracing for cultivation have been noted in many places. A small Early Bronze or Chalcolithic site has been observed at Kurnub, where an examination of the main wddi has shown that there are several weirs above the well known dams and that the two lowest dams were used for storing water, of which they could contain at least two million gallons. The Kurnub waterworks are elaborate and extensive, and it is hoped to study them in detail with the aid of air photographs. Work has also been done on map sheet No. 7 (Jaffa-Tel-Aviv). At Latrfin it has been possible to trace the course of a number of walls in the Crusader castle and to elucidate the disposition of its vaults, with the result that an architect's plan has been made which shows that the castle was an important structure of considerable size. The central building has yielded the most com- plete plan. It has walls about ten feet thick, with a batter which must give them a much greater thickness at the now buried base. Along the whole of the north side of the ground floor there was a single vaulted chamber, about twenty-five feet wide, which meets a similar chamber occupying most of the west side. Along the south side there are two rows of eleven vaults each, with pillars between the rows. In the eastern central part, near the entrance, a complex of vaults fills all the space there is, and west of this is a large cistern. In a peasant's house is a fragment of a massive arch, which does not fit into the plan at all, and must belong to an earlier building. At Ras el-'Ain a number of details previously unrecorded has been observed in the Qal'ah, and of this too an architect's plan has been made. It stands on a large tell, oriented northwest by southeast, and measures 500 by 400 m. Excava- tions carried out by the Department of Antiqui- ties showed that it was already occupied in the Middle Bronze Age. In a much later period it may be identified with the Herodian Antipatris. The plans and elevations which the Public Works Department had made of Jisr Jindas, built near Lydda by Baybars in 1273 A.D., have been checked, and some archaeological details added. The bridge is in danger of destruction by flood. The present bridge, however, was built vertically over another, either Roman or Byzan- tine in date. The lower part of the round arch of the earlier bridge is buried in the accumulated silt. An enormous amount of silt has been washed 1 AJA. xlii, 1938, p. 170.</page><page sequence="7">152 NELSON GLUECK down to the Jisr Jindas from the higher parts of the wddi since the bridges were built, and helps to make plain the damage which man-aided soil- erosion has done to Palestine since Byzantine times. It was also possible to inspect a number of sites of less importance, and some attention has been given to the possibility of using ancient sites as a means of gauging the rate of advance of sand dunes, and of estimating the dates at which they began to form. The latter would appear to vary with localities, but in no case to be very ancient. In the region just south of Jaffa practically the whole of the dunes would appear to have formed since Roman times, and their rate of advance seems to have been in the neighborhood of 5 m. a year, but this figure is provisional. Elsewhere, the investigations of the Survey go to show that man-aided soil-erosion has been steadily on the increase since Roman and Byzantine times, and that it has been a potent factor in the abandoning of many sites which then flourished. In his survey, Mr. Guy is making use of the new map of the Negeb, on the scale of 1:100.000, which the Palestine Government Survey Depart- ment is issuing, the Beersheba sheet having al- ready appeared. In this connection reference may be made to two excellent maps published during the year by the Palestine Government Survey Department, either under the direction or with the assistance of competent authorities. One is called "Palestine of the Old Testament," and the other "Palestine of the Crusades." Both were compiled under the direction of Col. F. J. Salmon. The first season's work (1937-38), in the south- ern desert of Western Palestine, on behalf of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, was carried out with conspicuous success.1 Much additional evidence has been gathered, in addi- tion to that obtained during the last few years by Frank and the present writer, on the trade- routes and inhabited sites of a large area which was once much less of a desert than it is today. In the course of repairs undertaken early in 1938, the Armenian authorities had occasion to remove the wooden screens and altar furnishings from the central and northern apses of St. Helena's chapel in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.2 Two mediaeval stone altars were thereby exposed, as well as the masonry of the apses, now stripped of plaster, and remains of a marble floor in the central apse. The main altar is built of well jointed limestone blocks, of ashlar construction, covered by a single marble slab measuring 2.41 m. by 1.34 m. The moulded edge of this slab projects about 8 cm. beyond the front and sides of the altar itself. A slot and four iron pegs near the back edge of the slab indicate the position of a superstructure that has now dis- appeared. There is also a slot sunk in the top of the masonry which runs some distance from near the center of the back of the altar immedi- ately before the covering slab. Behind the altar is a recess 1.01 m. wide and 0.41 m. deep, spanned by six voussoirs forming a low segmental arch. The arch springs from two wedge-shaped stones, the backs of which are cut to prolong the curve of the backs of the voussoirs. The altar is aligned with the front edge of the barrel vault pre- ceding the half-dome of the apse. In the floor, on each side of it, there is a strip of red marble, with a square slot sunk in it, now refilled. There are vestiges of a piscina in the north side of the apse, as well as a rough cupboard which was opened directly behind the altar at a period subsequent to the construction of the apse. The masonry both of the apse and of the altar is heavily scored with incised crosses of various forms. The altar, or prothesis table in the northern apse, is also of limestone, of ashlar construction, smaller and rather less well built than the main altar. It is surmounted by a plain slab of marble. In the back of the table there is an arched recess, 0.36 m. deep and 0.66 m. wide. The edge of the recess is bevelled. As in the main altar, there is a slot, here 0.52 m. long, running in from the back beneath the top slab. The front of the table is aligned with that of the main altar. In the wall immediately south of the prothesis table is a semicircular niche, 1.27 m. from the ground, measuring 0.73 m. in height and width. The re- moval of the plaster from the walls of the chapel has exposed a number of names painted in Gothic script. One of these inscriptions includes the date 1501. A deep rock-cut channel was discovered by workmen employed on the construction of a new house in the Sheikh Jarrth Quarter, Jerusalem. The channel is about 3 m. east of the main Nablus road, to which it runs parallel for a distance of some B9 m., being blocked at each end with falls of earth. The width is 60-70 cm. and the depth approximately 4.5 m. below the level of the road. 1 PEFQ.

The channel is roofed with rough slabs of stone and appears to have been some form of aqueduct bringing water to the city from the north. A section of this aqueduct was discovered some meters further north when the Nablus road was under con- struction in 1931. TRANSJORDAN: PREHISTORIC AND EARLY HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY During December, 1937, and February and April, 1938, J. D. Waechter, on behalf of the British School of Archaeology, Jerusalem, carried out a number of preliminary soundings in a series of sites in the WAdi Dh6bai, about 40 km. east- southeast of 'Amman. The culture of seven sites found has a strong resemblance to the Tahunian I of Jericho in its scrapers, points, one type of burin, lames de degagement, and core-tablets, and one type of burin distinctive to it. Three other sites have end-scrapers that can be compared with those of Wadi Mugharah E. Two more sites are known, discovered by 'Henry Field in his North Arabian Desert Expedition, and are referred to by him as Stations 212 and 913. In March-May, 1938, the American School of Oriental Research, Jerusalem, under the direction of the writer, carried out excavations at Tell el- Kheleifeh. It is situated near the Gulf of 'Aqabah, about half way between 'Aqabah on the Transjordan side, and Mrashrash on the Pales- tine side. The site is to be identified with Ezion- geber-Elath. It is now several hundred meters distant from the gulf, into which the shore-line extends at the rate of about ten centimeters a year. About a third of the site has been opened up. The construction is mud-brick. At the north- west corner of the site is an intricate smelting and refining plant, with double rows of flues in the walls of the rooms, and an interconnecting system of air-channels, which extend lengthwise through the walls. Much copper and some iron were smelted and refined. There were numerous workshops in the town for the manufacture of metal articles. Fish-hooks, small spearheads used in spearing fish, fibulae, animal figurines, nails, small dishes, etc., were made out of copper, and to a lesser degree, of iron. Copper and iron de- posits exist in the vicinity and along the length of the 'Arabah. All indications point to the fact that the main period of the occupation of Tell el- Kheleifeh and the best buildings belong to the time of King Solomon. His ships used to sail from Ezion-geber to Ophir and back. All of the pottery found belongs to the Early Iron Age and there are enough familiar types to relate it to the Early Iron Age pottery of Pales- tine and Transjordan. There are sufficient differ- ences in much of the pottery, however, from that generally prevalent in other Palestinian and Transjordanian sites of the same period, to com- pel a new classification. Ezion-geber is probably the apex of a cultural triangle formed by north- western Arabia and northeastern Sinai. When these areas are explored, it is probable that the same types of pottery will be found as in Ezion- geber. There were also connections with south- westernmost Palestine. Some of the Ezion-geber objects can be paralleled in ancient Gaza. The new types of pottery at Ezion-geber are dis- tinguished in particular by horn-handles and ledge-handles on crude handmade pots. The ledge- handles are large and small, but always have a definite utility. Sometimes there were small, vertical ledge-handles, although most of them were of the horizontal type. Many of the latter type are at times so deeply serrated that they may be said to consist of a series of horn-handles, wedged together at their bases. They might be designated as "horn-ledge-handles." The presence of the ledge-handle type of pottery may be explained in part by the utility of such pottery in a smelting plant and a manufacturing center. A more adequate explanation would appear to be that they belong to a distinctive cultural area, quite apart from that of Judah and Edom. More familiar types of pottery also exist at Tell el- Kheleifeh, such as cooking-pots with ribbed rims; pilgrim flasks; some, but not much, bur- nished and painted ware; lamps, etc. None of the pottery precedes the thirteenth century B.C., and little of it can be dated beyond the seventh century B.C. A number of stamped jar-handles were found. They read: "Belonging to q w s ' n 1, the servant of the king." It is a theophorous name, containing in its first half the name of an Edomite deity, Q6s. Other inscriptions were found, includ- ing two letters of a South Arabic script. The latter inscription, the first of its kind to be found in a controlled excavation, may be assigned to the eighth century B.C. The American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem continued the archaeological survey of Transjordan under the direction of the writer,</page><page sequence="9">154 NELSON GLUECK in co6peration with the Transjordan Department of Antiquities. The total number of ancient sites now examined by the expedition somewhat ex- ceeds seven hundred. The survey has been more or less completed as far as the Wadi Zerqa. In conformity with recent refinements in pottery- dating in Western Palestine, due particularly to studies by Engberg and Shipton, Albright, and Wright, the writer now dates the main extent of the Early Bronze Age occupation of Trans- jordan south of the Wadi ZerqA between the twenty-third and twentieth centuries B.c. There are numerous indications, however, that the beginnings of the Bronze Age occupation pre- cede the twenty-third century B.c. There is no reason why excavations at some of the sites dis- covered should not reveal early occupation going back as far as the Chalcolithic period. In the main, in all the area examined there is no sedentary occupation between the twentieth and the begin- ning of the thirteenth centuries B.c. In Ammon and the territory once occupied by Sih6n, king of the Amorites, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations are not inferior to those of Moab and Edom and Western Palestine. Previous explora- tions by Albright north of the Wadi Zerqa show that in north Gilead and the .Haurin there is the same continuous occupation from EB to El I-II that characterizes the history of settlement in Western Palestine. On the very edge of the Widi Zerqd, the writer has found several sites, where, in addition to EB and MB I sherds, some early MB II sherds were found. TRANSJORDAN: LATE HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY At intervals since 1929 an Italian expedition under the direction of Renato Bartoccini has been conducting excavations on the acropolis at 'Amman., They were continued during 1938, with results which as yet are not public. The magnificent Roman temple has been partly cleared, and many important architectural fea- tures brought to light. Among them was a frieze with the name of Marcus Aurelius on it. The exca- vator is of the opinion that the temple was begun before the time of Marcus Aurelius and that build- ing operations were resumed during this period. Much evidence of the pre-Roman occupation of the citadel hill was uncovered. The beautiful Arabic structure north of the temple was also cleared. The excavator finds similarities to Me- shetta, but does not detail them in the notes at the writer's disposal. The scientific public awaits with much eagerness somewhat fuller reports on the exceedingly important excavations than have appeared thus far. During the first half of December, 1937, the joint expedition of the American School of Orien- tal Research, Jerusalem, and the Transjordan Department of Antiquities, under the direction of the writer, concluded the excavations at Kh. et-Tannir,2 which had previously been carried on during March and April, 1937. A new Zeus- Hadad head of Parthian type was found. The first part of the work was devoted to an examina- tion of the shrine in the raised, inner temple court. It had previously been determined that there were three distinct building periods in the history of the temple as a whole, and of the inner shrine in particular. The north walls of Shrines II and III were removed, and it was found that the pavement went under them and had been laid originally against a low plinth extending along the north side of Shrine I. Jebel Tannuir may have been a sacred moun- tain also in pre-Nabataean times. The original Nabataean shrine was a small, simple structure, measuring 1.45 m. by 1.38 m. It may well have been constructed in the first part of the first cen- tury B.c. A considerable period after the con- struction of Shrine I, and some time before the construction of Shrine II, perhaps in the third quarter of the first century B.c., the shrine had so grown in importance and wealth, that a well made, dressed-stone pavement was laid in the raised inner temple area around Shrine I. The second shrine was built around and over the first. To this Shrine II belongs the HIaretat HIuldai inscription, dated to 7 B.c. The third shrine, built over the second, may date to the second quarter of the second century A.D. On the north and south sides of the temple-complex are triclinia, in which the ritual meals took place. There is a striking rela- tionship between the entire temple-plan of Kh. et-Tannir and that of the Great High Place of Zibb 'Atfif at Petra. 1 Bartoccini, "La Rocca Sacra degli Ammo- niti," Atti del IV Congresso Nazionale di Studi Romani, 1938, pp. 3-8, pl.

Caton- Thompson, in company with Freya Stark and E. W. Gardner, undertook an exploratory trip to study the geology and archaeology of IHadhra- maut in southwest Arabia.1 Miss Caton-Thomp- son was responsible for the archaeology of the district. Her work centered on Hureidha south of the Wadi Hadhramaut. It covered the chief aspects of pre-Islamic activities in the region, and yielded information concerning domestic dwellings, irrigation works, and places of worship and burial. The ruins are scattered over about ten square kilometres of the loess-like plain. A noticeable feature was a large number of fairly evenly spaced stone-rubble heaps, which sprang from bare, wind-swept ground. Detailed mapping proved them to be relics of a large irrigation sys- tem. The source of the water was the monsoon summer rain. The flood was led off the main chan- nel far above the irrigated area, to which it was carried by a canal 16-20 m. broad, still discernible in the sandy waste. From this, numerous smaller channels distributed the water in a network of runnels. The irrigated area was occupied by homesteads. One such homestead was excavated, and disclosed a five-to-six roomed, mud-brick building, formerly limewashed, fitted with mud- brick benches. Logs of wood reinforced the door- treads. The ceiling had been constructed in the fashion still practiced in the region, of twigs laid in parallel bundles across rafters and overdaubed with mud. The writer is particularly interested in this description of a South-Arabian house, because it fits exactly the description of houses built at Ezion-geber on the northern shore of the Gulf of 'Aqabah at an earlier date. Nearby was a temple, which was excavated by the expedition. It is an oblong structure, measur- ing 17 by 20 m., set on a raised platform capping a natural eminence, with its main facade on the southwest. The temple platform was reached by two stone stairways. There is reason to believe that the temple was originally wholly plastered; pavings, stairways and partition walls were cer- tainly thus faced. These details with regard to the temple are particularly interesting because of the close connections that may be discerned between them and features of the Nabataean temple at Kh. et-Tanntir in Transjordan, and of the temple at Hierapolis, described in Lucian's De Dea Syria, and Nabataean altars in Petra.3 A cluster of out- lying buildings by the temple included some apsi- dal structures of small size, characterized by a central, free-standing, altar-like stone, sur- rounded by a bench of flat slabs, rectangular on three sides, convex on the front. Standing erect against the base of one such "altar" were two baetylic stones, one rudely fashioned from a stone into human form, the other a symmetrically tapered, rough-dressed stone. Both were care- fully imbedded upright in plaster, and before them were placed stone incense-burners of rec- tangular form, stained red and patterned, as well as earthenware saucers and a stone offering tray. The temple, referred to in one of the dedicatory inscriptions by the name Madabum, was devoted to the worship of the Moon God. Miss Caton-Thompson thinks that the semi- civilized culture brought to light near Hureidha probably lies within the last few centuries before the Christian era. Debased, amulets of Egyp- tian derivation were found, in addition to seals which denote intercourse with Achaemenian re- gions. SYRIA: EARLY HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY At 'Atshanah,2 near Antioch, the British Mu- seum continued excavations in 1938, again under the direction of Sir Leonard Woolley. The palace excavated was built about 1600 B.c. and de- stroyed by fire about the middle of the fifteenth century B.c. Nearly 300 inscribed tablets were recovered from the ruins. In them are mentioned the names of two kings, Niqmepa (?) and his son Ilima-ili, rulers of the city of Alalakh, which is identified by Woolley with the 'Atshanah mound. The palace, divided into two parts, was two stories high. It appears that the royal family lived in the upper chambers, approached by a wide flight of wooden stairs, built in a brick stair-well. The ground-floor rooms were given over to the personal attendants of the family, the rooms on one side of the central court being reserved for men, those on the other side for women. Each set of apartments forms a self-contained unit with bedrooms, bathroom and lavatory. Other quarters 1 Caton-Thompson, Nature 142, July 23, 1938, p. 139. 2 ILN.

Below this were the remains of a second and older wall, and buried in the mud-brick of this was the gate of the city of Alalakh as it existed in the eighteenth, or possibly the nineteenth century B.C. The entrance passage passed between high towers, and was closed by three sets of gates, the jambs of which were solid piers projecting from the tower walls. A little copper statuette of a god riding on an eagle was found among the ruins of the gate. The ruins of the palace yielded, among other things, a ram's head in polished limestone, which, accord- ing to Woolley, is the oldest work of Hittite art known. Painted pottery found is associated with the Hurrian element of the town's population. There was also recovered a fine collection of pot- tery of the Cypriote Bronze Age type, which seems to be of Asiatic origin, according to the excavator. Under the direction of M. E. Mallowan, on behalf of the British Museum and of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq, in 1938 a third campaign of excavation was undertaken at Tell Brak,' situated about 925 miles south of NisibTn, in northeast Syria. In accordance with what seems to be almost an archaeological law with regard to important discoveries, there was discovered to- wards the close of the season's campaign the name and date of a builder on the site. Imbedded in the walls of the palace were mud bricks, stamped with the name of Naram-Sin, fourth king of the Semitic dynasty of Akkad, grandson of Sargon, who founded the Akkadian empire. The palace was therefore first built about 2500 B.c. The palace was finally sacked, perhaps by local inhabitants of the district, who took advantage of the weaken- ing of authority at the end of Naram-Sin's reign. The Akkadian dynasty, however, rebuilt the palace, which probably survived till shortly before 9000 B.C., after which date Brak became a town of secondary importance. In clay vessels buried under the floors of houses outside the palace were found deposits of earrings of gold and silver; stone cylinder-seals; animal amulets, carved in steatite and lapis-lazuli, and necklaces of semi-precious stones. The jewellery bears a striking similarity to that found in the royal graves at Ur. Among the cuneiform tablets found on the site were two containing lists of laborers and cattle sent from various places. Among the names of what may have been neigh- boring towns were hitherto unknown ones, such as Lilabsilum, Sukhna, Kundisi, Khilamat, Khebi- ram, Bishum, Sumukhdar. The south wing of the palace was found to rest on the top of a huge mud-brick platform or tower, which had been in existence about 3000 B.c., about 500 years before the time of Naram- Sin. The outer walls of this tower were faced with great, rough blocks of basalt. Beneath its founda- tions was a whole network of subterranean cham- bers, already plundered of some of their contents in ancient times. Over 40,000 faience beads were, nevertheless, recovered from these chambers, in addition to semi-precious stones, and some beads of gold. There were also numerous amulets, carved in animal form and depicting a complete menagerie. They included lions, gazelles, bears, hedgehogs, ibex, pigs, hares, frogs, eagles, ducks, fish, sheep and cows, in materials ranging from serpentine, alabaster, variegated marble and quartz, to shell, mother-of-pearl, faience and bone. They are representative of the Jemdet Nasr period of art, and extend down to Early Dynastic times. That all these objects were intended as foundation deposits was suggested by the discovery of a hoard of alabaster idols, consisting of about 900 complete specimens alone, not to mention thousands of fragments. Most of the idols had flat bodies, elon- gated necks, and large eyes often inlaid with black, red, or orange paint. Some had double or triple heads, and a few had a smaller image of an idol engraved on the front of the body, suggesting a symbolic mother and child. The fifth campaign of the Louvre at Mari on the Middle Euphrates, under the direction of M. Andre Parrot, lasted from the beginning of Octo- ber to the end of December, 1937.2 The excavation of the palace was continued, but not completed; although 960 rooms or courts have been exposed in a building area of more than five acres, at least a quarter of the building area still remains to be excavated. The palace represents the most com- plete example of architecture of about 2000 B.c. that has been found to date in the course of Mesopotamian excavation. The excavations in the palace revealed special suites, comprising living-rooms, bathroom and kitchen, which were put at the disposal of the king's guests. From the I ILN.

On the stairs was found a small headless statue, bearing an inscription with the name of Prince Idi-ilum of Mari. Another small statue bore a text giving the name of Lasgan. Several thousands of additional tablets were found in various rooms, bringing the total recovered to nearly 25,000. When finally published, they will contribute im- measurably to the history of the Babylonian world in the time of Hammurabi. The Ziggurat not far from the palace, which still rises nearly 50 feet over the plain, was partly excavated. It was found that a temple, still com- paratively well preserved, had been cut into its side. It opened on a large terrace. On either side of the entrance stood sacrificial altars. Entrance to the sanctuary is gained by a long, narrow pas- sage, leading to a large chamber against the walls of which stood large beds, which have been asso- ciated with the rite of sacred marriage. Two bronze lions faced the door of the sanctuary. They were made of wood, covered with thin bronze leaf. The inlaid eyes were of stone, blue-grey for the pupils and white for the eyeballs. Certain tablets discovered at Mari indicated that one of its kings had kept live lions. There is evidence that around the Ziggurat stood fifteen wooden lions, covered with bronze leaf. They may have been destroyed by the soldiers of Hammurabi, who sacked the palace of Mari. SYRIA: LATE HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY In the spring of 1938, the Antioch expedition of Princeton University and the Louvre, under the direction of W. A. Campbell, continued its work. In Antioch, the discovery of the Hellenistic bridge, by which the ancient main street was carried over the torrent Onopnictes, established an important topographical point in the center of the city, and brought to light an excellently preserved example of a monumental Hellenistic arched construction. On the west side of the main street a large build- ing, which the expedition has been excavating for several campaigns, was identified as a bath by a mosaic inscription recording a reconstruction in the sixth century A.D. From this period were recovered examples of ornamental mosaics, de- signed with textile motifs, and several inscribed Corinthian capitals. On a lower level in the same structure was found a pool, with a mosaic that contained a large bust of Tethys emerging from the sea. Other excavations in Antioch were devel- oped around chance finds of pavements made by peasants working in their fields. In Daphne, the well known suburb of Antioch, a complex of houses was excavated; and in Anti- och's seaport, Seleucia Pieria, the topographical survey, begun last year, was continued. The street system of the large acropolis of Seleucia was determined, and the clearing in this section of a terrace and a late Doric temple indicated that work here will be very productive. In the lower section of Seleucia, built around the lower harbor, an interesting structure (probably a church) was partly uncovered.
