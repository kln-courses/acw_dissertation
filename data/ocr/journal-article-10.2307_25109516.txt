Frankfurt am Main : J. D. Sauerlander's Verlag. 1869. 12 Bande, 8vo, Friedrich Ruckert died at Neusess, January 31, 1866. During the three years that have elapsed since his decease, the most widely diverse opinions have been expressed as to the character of his poetic faculty and the nature and extent of his influence on German letters. While some critics have assigned him a niche in the Walhalla of illus trious Musensohne by the side of Goethe and Schiller, others have failed to discover in him any original creative power, except a certain talent for form, a peculiar vigor and ingenuity as a neologist, a facile exuber ance of rhymes and metres, and a remarkable virtuosoship in language ; which, however, have too often tempted him into excessive artificialities and affectations of style, and into verbal quirks and quibbles extremely offensive to the purists, and corrupting to the younger generation of poets, who, in taking him as their model, have, like all servile imitators, exaggerated the defects which they copied. But, however much truth there may be in these strictures, nothing certainly could be more unjust than to hold Riickert responsible for the pompous and weary platitudes of feeble imitators, who embody their languid sentimentalities in Oriental metres, and imagine that they have fathomed the depths and caught the spirit of Persian poetry because they praise the roses of Shiraz, talk of houris and peris, apostrophize the nightingale as the bulbul, and dignify that peculiar species of Teu</page><page sequence="2">1869.] Friedrich Riickert and his Works. 585 tonic crapulence known as Katzenjammer with the name of bidamag buden.* As well might we call Goethe to account for all the malheurs de Vamour which have afflicted society and literature since the publication of Werther, or make Schiller amenable to an indignant posterity for the mor bid pathos and bombastic iambics of Ernst Benjamin Salomon Raupach. The peculiar source of Ruckert's poetic inspiration is a fine sympathy with nature, awakened and fostered in him by the influences which sur rounded his early life in the beautiful valley of the Main, with its green meadows and vine-clad hills and mediaeval cities, not more refreshing to the eye on account of its picturesque and romantic scenery than charm ing to the imagination as the seat of poesy and the home of the Muses. In the first section of his volume, Dr. Beyer gives a full and in many respects interesting account of Ruckert's youth, his education at home, at school, and especially in the woods and fields, the local legends on which his imagination fed, and the characteristics and customs of the villagers who used to speak of father Riickert and his sons as " the tall stork with its storklings." These little incidents artistically woven to gether furnish a fine genre-picture of village life in Germany towards the close of the last century, and help us also to understand more per fectly some of the salient features and idiosyncrasies of the man. But in this connection our author makes a strange blunder on page 28, where he quotes three Latin verses, and affirms that they were written by Riickert in 1802, i. e. in the fourteenth year of his age. The verses are the following, ? " Esse deos credamne, fidem quum laeserit ilia ? Quam longos habuit nondum perjura capillos, Tarn longos postquam numina laesit, habet," ? and are cited by the biographer as " das alteste Denkmal von der Hand des Knaben," called forth by the pangs of disappointed affection. We certainly recognize in them a very " old monument" expressive of sen timents as old as the human race; for by referring to Ovid's Amores (III. 3. 1 - 4.) we read how the graceful and susceptible Roman elegist felt under similar circumstances, de arnica quae pejeraverat: ? " Esse deos i crede ; fidem jurata fefellit, Et facies illi, quae fuit ante, manet. Quam longos habuit nondum perjura capillos, Tarn longos, postquam numina laesit, habet." * Immermann satirizes the Orientalism of Platen and his school in the following xenion: ? " Von den Priichten, die sie aus dem Gartenhain von Schairas stehlen, Essen sie zu viel, die Armen, und vomiren dann Ghaselen." This description, though unjustly applied to Platen perhaps, fitly characterizes the smaller fry of pseudo-Oriental poets.</page><page sequence="3">586 Friedrich Ruckert qntd his Works. [Oct. Some editions of Ovid have esse deos credamne, which, however, is re garded by critics as a corrupt text. Evidently the youthful Friedrich, wounded by the fickleness of his " blue-eyed Annel," wrote these lines from memory, omitting the first pentameter, and not dreaming that, more than half a century later, they would reappear in print as an original production. In Ruckert's " Juvenile Poems," dating from 1807, there prevails to some extent the same elegiac-sentimental tone that pervades all the lyrics of Matthisson, Tiedge, and Salis-Seewis, but with less monotony of melancholy and far richer variety of contents and form. Of these early efforts, the most characteristic are those in which the world of elves and wood-nymphs and water-sprites is described, in strophes whose rhymes and intonations fall upon the ear like echoes from fairy land. Ruckert's later attempts to treat the same popular legends in ballads are enfeebled by excessive prolixity, the radical vice of all im provisators. In the war sonnets (Gehar?iischte Sonnette) of 1814, wrhich appeared under the nom de guerre of Freimund Reimar, he showed a marvellous power of pouring his glowing thoughts and feelings into the narrowest and most inflexible form of verse, employing, as the vehicle of martial and patriotic sentiments, the soothing quatrains and tercets which, since Petrarch, had been used only to express the tender est idyllic and erotic emotions. The chief defect of these poems is lack of simplicity and directness.. The exuberance of the style, the surpris ing ingenuity and continuous jingling of the rhymes, the strange conceits and wealth of imagery which distinguish them, impress the reader with a disagreeable sense of fictitiousness and jugglery. In reality neither Arndt nor Korner was more in earnest than this seeming dilettante. " A special predilection for lyric poetry," says Goethe, " is a symptom of dilettanteism." The danger here indicated is the tendency of ex tremely subjective poetry to lapse into mere prettinesses. Yet Goethe himself was pre-eminently a lyrical poet, endowed with the finest fac ulty of detecting the delicate affinities that unite the world of sense to the world of imagination and exalt the commonest objects to a com panionship with the phantasies of the dreamy mind. In the poet's vision, as in the apostle's trance, there is nothing " common or unclean." . Even " the tender horns of cockled snails " are used by Shakespeare to illustrate the sensibilities of love, and are so dignified by his touch as to be worthy of a place in one of his noblest passages, side by side with the Hesperides and Apollo's lute. He understood the conversation of the plants, and knew the secret of every young rose ; he sympathized with the dying " bud bit by an envious worm " ; his eye discovered " the crimson drops i' the bottom of a cowslip," and transformed them into</page><page sequence="4">1869.] Friedrich Riickert and his Works. 587 the " mole cinque-spotted" on the fair bosom of the sleeping Imogen. In this respect, Ruckert's genius was akin to Shakespeare's, as is shown especially in such lyrics as "Die sterbende Blume," " Friihlingslied,'* and " Abendlied." He has imparted new life and meaning to the forms of nature, by filling them with the precious substance of his mind; the luxuriance of his unparalleled diction has overgrown and beauti fied the whole face of things, like an ivy that mantles everything with its verdure, leaving no surface uncovered, no pinnacle unclimbed, no 'chink unperietrated. In opposition to the nonchalance in rhythm and rhyme which degrade some of Heine's verses to the level of doggerel, Riickert laid great stress upon form, which he regarded as the " keystone" of every poetic creation: ? " Grundstein zwar ist der Gehalt, Doch der Schlussstein die Gestalt." Also in the " Lieder und Spriiche " he declares it to be his peculiar mission to invent and introduce new forms of metrical expression, and thus " increase the treasury of human speech." " Ein neuer Reim, ein neuer Satz Dunkt mich ein Zuwachs jenem Schatz; Ein andrer wirk' in andern Spharen, Doch, ich bin hier an meinem Platz." The importance which he attached to the merely mechanical part in ver sification, and the facility with which he wrote everything druckreif, very seldom retouching his work with the file, often caused him to neglect the substance of his compositions. A poet who publishes nearly six hundred lyrics in two successive years (as was the case with Riickert during 1832 and 1833) cannot devote much time to polishing or pro foundly meditating his productions. Yet even here the reader is charmed by the musical flow of the phrase, however trite and prosaie the sentiments expressed, ? " Anmuthig werden selbst alltagliche Sentenzen Im Silberwasserfall melodiseher Cadenzen," ? although the passing thought may be as commonplace as the lamenta tions of an author over the want of good quill-pens. (Weisheit des Brahmanen, III. 68.) Riickert, too, was the most cosmopolitan of German poets. In Scandinavia, Greece, Arabia, Persia, Palestine, India, and China, he was as much at home as in his own fatherland on the banks of the Main. The wide range of his intellectual sympathies, more universal even than Herder's, embraced almost every form of speech in which the miiid jof man has left a record of itself.</page><page sequence="5">588 Friedrich Ruckert and his Works. [Oct. " Was dem Griechen Ohrenschmaus War, vom Helikone, Dem Brahmanen Ganga-Braus Unter Palmenkrone, In der Wiiste Geistcrgraus Hagar's freiem Sohne, Zaubr* ich, dass im deutschen Haus Es mit Einklang wohne." The fruits and flowers of poesy from every zone grew under his artistic hand, nofr into the wanton luxuriance of a tropical jungle, but * into a rich and delicious garden, where the native perfumes of Hymet tus and the Himalayas mingle with " Sabean odors from the spicy shore Of Araby the blest." He put all nations and races under tribute, and, in his own words, " took spiritual tithes (Geisteszehnten) of the East and of the West." In fertility and ingenuity as a neologist, Ruckert surpasses Luther, and is second only to Fischart, whose neologisms are all indigenous growths, and spring up spontaneously and symmetrically out of Ger man roots, whereas those of Ruckert are Oriental exotics, ? scions of the banian grafted upon the Hercynian oak. Thus in " Nal und Damajanti," an episode of the " Mahabharata," the heroine is pro trayed as " Die Gliederzartwuchsrichtige, Volimondsangesichtige, Gewolbtaugenbraunbogige, Sanftlachelredewogigd." The horses also are described as " Derbmagere, schwernachhaltige, Unfeine, wegesgewaltige, Breitnasige, starkkinnbackige, Langschenklige, hochnackige, Haarstruppige, mahnenstraifoige, Windstiirmige, flammenschnaubige." Expressive as these colossal epithets are, euphonious and easily intelli gible as they may be to the ear of the Sanskrit scholar, and interest ing as is the evidence which they furnish of the plasticity of the Ger man language, they present a very strange aspect to the eye, and produce a very bewildering effect upon the mind of the ordinary reader. Yet even these gigantic polysyllables are models of chaste ness and elegance when compared with Platen's " Demagogenriecher nashornsangesicht " and " Obertollhausuberschnappungsnarrenschiff," or the foreign words and phrases which give to some of Freiligrath's poems a macaronic appearance bordering upon burlesque. The same</page><page sequence="6">1869.] Friedrich Riickert and his Works. 589 repulsive effect is produced also by an excessive use of diminutives, as e. g. in the " Oestliche Rosen," in the gasel " Der gescheiterte Kuss," the rhymes, Adamsrippchen, Lippchen, Schnippchen, Nippcheny Perlenhlippchen, etc., follow each other usque ad nauseam, and seriously hinder the enjoyment of these otherwise charming lyrics. Riickert's " Eastern Roses" and other Oriental poems owe their origin partly to the impulse given to German literature by Goethe's Westostlicher Divan (1818), and partly to the interest which Riickert took in Orien tal studies both as professor and Privatgelehrter. One of the first and finest fruits of these scholarly pursuits was a free translation of the Ara bian poet Hariri, which Riickert himself refers to as an illustration, ? " Wie Poesie und Philologie einander zu fbrdern Und zu erganzen vermag." In " Rostem und Suhrab " we have a still freer translation of the most touching and tragic episode in Firdusi's great epic, " Shah-Nameh"; in the poetic breviary (Mesnewi) of " Mewlana Dschelaleddin Rumi," on the contrary^ Riickert not only enriched European literature with a new metrical form (the gasel), but also opened to the Western mind the sources of Persian mysticism in this revered oracle of the Sufies and illustrious founder of the Dervish order of the Mewlewi. The German poem reproduces admirably the spirit of this Persian sect, in whose writings the quietistic fervor and devotion of Islam are blended with the transcendent fascination and speculative subtlety of Platonic idealism. As a specimen of the peculiar versification of the gasel, in which the rhyme of the first two lines is repeated in the fourth, sixth, eighth, etc., to the end of the poem, we may cite the following, entitled " Der Schmuck der Mutter ": ? " Mensch ! es ist der Sehopfung Pracht Nicht fur dich allein gemacht. " Einen Theil hat sich zur Lust Die Natur hervorgebracht. " Darum singt die Nachtigall, Wo du schlummerst, in der Nacht. " Und die schonste Blume bliiht, Eh' des Tages Aug' erwacht. " Und der schonste Schmetterling Pliegt, wo Niemand sein hat Acht. " Perle ruht im Meeresschooss, Und der Edelstein im Schacht. " Kind! da reichlich Aug' und Ohr Dir mit Piillen ist bed acht; " Gonn' der, Mutter Etwas auch, Das sie zum Geschmeid sich macht."</page><page sequence="7">590 Friedrich Ruckert and his Works. [Oct. The rich veins of aphoristic wisdom which run through the Gaselen, and which impart, indeed, a peculiar philosophic coloring to all the lyric poetry of the East, were especially attractive to Ruckert, who, what ever rank he may take in other departments of literature, is unques tionably the greatest didactic poet of modern times. This reflective and gnomic tone pervades all his poetry; even his lyric verse con stantly verges upon the didactic, as that of Uhland glides insensibly into the epic, or that of Freiligrath takes a descriptive and panoramic character. In the " Brahmanische Erzahlungen," and other transla tions from Hindu epopees, this tendency is very marked, particularly in the fondness ? sliding into diffuseness?with which he portrays the life and doctrines of the gymnosophists, " die nackten Weisen." But it is in the " Weisheit des Brahmanen " that this poetic contemplativeness finds its fullest expression. In this congeries of sententious mono logues, Ruckert, sitting as it were in Brahmanic garb on the banks of the sacred Ganges, pours forth in alexandrines the mature results of his ethical studies and metaphysical speculations. All the relations and conditions of man in respect to age, rank, race, sex, religion, politics, and society, ? every thought, feeling, and situation belonging to human life, ? receive here new illumination. There is scarcely a system of theology or philosophy in the spiritual and intellectual his tory of mankind that is not touched and transmuted by his imagination; as the sun " plays the alchemist, Turning, with splendor of his precious eye, The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold." Our limited space does not permit us to illustrate this statement by citation, and we must therefore content ourselves writh a few references which the reader may easily verify. Thus we find allusions either confirming or confuting the pre-Socratic speculations of Thales, Anaxi mander, and Anaximenes in their efforts to discover the original and universal essence of things (W. d. Br., II. 29), the perpetual flux and reflux of Heraclitus (III. 61), the negative and barren cynicism of Antisthenes (XVII. 21), sarcasms like those which Xenophanes, the Eleatic, directed against anthropomorphism and anthropopathism (VIII. 7, XIII. 21), the psychology of Plato (II. 28, VIII. 14, XL 2, XII. 50) the Cartesian cogito, ergo sum (VIII. 18), the monadology of Leibnitz as opposed to the atomism of Epicurus (XL 2), the sensationalism of Hobbes, Gassendi, and Locke (XX. 12), the to ev kcl\ to irav of Spinoza (V. 19), the "Ding an sich" of Kant (V. 18), the subjective idealism of Fiehte (VIII. 17), Schelling's "intellectual intuition" and identity of thought and being (XVII. 39), conceptions and relations of space and</page><page sequence="8">1869.] Friedrich Riickert and his Works. 591 time (XVII. 28, VIII. 20), the materialism of La Mettrie and the sen sualism of Condillac (XVII. 5) ; in fine, one might easily collate from the twenty books of this poem a survey of the principal systems of philosophy that have prevailed, from the crude physics of the Ionic school to the absolute idealism of Hegel, including also the tenets of Persian mystics, Chinese moralists, and Indian gymnosophists, as well as rationalistic theories of revelation (XVII. 6,43, XIV. 64) and biblical exegesis (IV. 34), and the most earnest admonitions to tolerance and humanity (II. 10, X. 55). Riickert's antipathy to the proselyting spirit of " stupid zealots " was as decided as that of Lessing, or of Anastasius Griin (e. g. in " Spaziergange eines Wiener Poeten," p. 14). Nature, he says, has provided suitable food for every animal and proper nour ishment for every soul; but evangelical proselytism refuses to recognize . this fact and seeks to impose on all races of men a uniform spiritual diet. " Wenn ihr unter Menschenheeren Nichts mehr findet zu bekehren, Werdet ihr noch aus den AfFen Eine Art von Christen schaffen." In another poem, he proclaims himself a heathen in the same sense and for the same reason that this term has been applied to Goethe: ? " Ihr machtet es mir zu toll Mit euerm christlichen Leide : Mein Herz ist noch freudenvoll; Darum bin ich ein Heide. Bricht einst mein Lebensmuth, Dann konnt ihr vielleicht mich erwerben, Denn eure Lehr' ist gut Zu nichts auf der Welt.als zum Sterben." He finds more devotional inspiration in the free mountain air than in the gloomy atmosphere of the charnel-house: ? " Meine Andacht lodert Mcht, wo Grabduft modert, Sondern Bergluft weht." As regards the Erlangen theologians, he declares it to be the only sound principle of dogmatics, that those who are so eager to light the fires of hell should burn in them: ? " Die christliche Kritik mag's anerkennen : Wer so die Holle heizt, verdient darin zu frrennen." Riickert's versified harmony of the gospels, "Leben Jesu, Evangelien harmonie in gebundener Rede," is an attempt to reconstruct poetically the life of Christ out of the purely moral elements which it contains, and which, lying outside of all questions oTf historic credibility, had not been</page><page sequence="9">592 Friedrich Ruckert and his Works. [Oct. disturbed by the scientific criticism of Strauss. It is, howrever, an ex ceedingly unsatisfactory production, and hardly deserves to be called a work of art. The best thing that can be said of it is that it gave the originating impulse to Leopold Schefer's " Laienbrevier" and to the " Laienevangelium" of Friedrich von Sallet. Ruckert too, like Shakespeare, had his Midsummer Night's Dream, or Vision in der Johannisnacht, in which he reveals to us, not a world of fantastic contrasts, ? kings, queens, fairies, and " rude mechanicals," Oberon, Titania, " gentle Puck," and " sweet bully Bottom," ? but the growth and education of humanity in races and nations, a philosophy of universal history based upon the fundamental idea that the progress of civilization is an advance from homogeneity to heterogeneity in ac cordance with a well-established law of evolution. A reminiscence of this division and differentiation of mankind has been preserved in legend under the symbol of a building in the erection of which the intelligent and harmonious co-operation of the architects was broken up. The work on this splendid, heaven-aspiring edifice of human cul ture ceased, and, in tlje general confusion that ensued, each man took what suited his taste and purpose, and thus they were all " scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth ": ? " Der Eine trug ein Winkelmass, Der Andre einen Hammer, Und was der Drift* als Schatz besass, War irgend eine Klammer, Und irgend ein zerbrochner Schaft, Und was in Eil' er aufgerafft; So trugen sie die Pfander Zerstreut in alle Lander." With these tools and materials they have been building ever since, each in his own way, structures of religion, politics, society, industry, and literature, in India, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and other countries of ancient and modern times. The poet in his vision describes the peculiar fea tures of these various types of civilization as stages of development or styles of architecture in the sublime temple of humanity. Vivid and almost dithyrambic in its impetuous fervor is the delineation of the Cru sades and of their results as displayed in mediaeval art and poetry, Gothic cathedral and Minnesang, and in those miracles of form and color which sprang into being on wall and canvas, when " Michael, the most terrible of the cherubim, and Raphael, the brightest of the sera phim, entered as painters into the service of the Church." Riickert's dramas, " Konig Arsak von Armenien," " Saul und David," "Herodes der Grosse," "Kaiser Heinrich IV," and "Christo foro Colombo," have a close logical connection with the Midsummer</page><page sequence="10">1869.] Friedrich Riickert and his Works. 593 Night's Dream, inasmuch as the themes chosen represent great epochs in the history of the human race; such as the institution of mon archy, the establishment of a hierarchy, the rise of Christianity, and the discovery of the New World. To these might be added the Aristo phanic comedy " Napoleon," and the cycle of fiwe dramas entitled " Die Sachsischen Kaiser," of which, however, only " Heinrich I." and a part of " Otto der Grosse " were finished. It is only in a modified sense that the term " drama " is applicable to these productions ; they resemble rather a kind of literary oratorio, in which the musical ele ment is predominant and serves to connect a series of historical pictures, with no attempts at psychological portraiture or the solution of dramatic intrigues. In this respect we might compare them with the earliest Greek tragedies, the " Persians " and " Prometheus " of iEschylus, in which there is neither well-developed plot nor fine individual charac terization, but simply an epic delineation of scenes and events follow ing each other in chronological succession and united by the dithyrambic lyrics of the chorus. The passions portrayed in the sonnets and erotics of Shakespeare indicate the sources of experience from which he drew his exhaustless knowledge of the world and of the soul. Goethe is never so genuinely dramatic as when he depicts feelings and circum stances akin to the errors and discords of his own youth. Riickert's nature was too spotless, his life was too free from inner conflicts and from those strong emotions which quicken the pulse and thrill in every sense, to develop in him the dramatic faculty. His inspirations were as pure as the breeze that moves the -ZEolian harp to melody. The sophistries of passion and the dialectics of extenuation, which underlie the great tragedies of human life, were wholly foreign to him. Conse quently his plays are utterly destitute of the action which grows out of such antagonisms and of the motives by which they are excited and de termined. It is safe to say that more monotonous and tedious produc tions have not appeared in German literature since Klopstock wrote his bardic hymns and biblical dialogues. Dr. Beyer's volume contains an interesting comparison of Riickert with Goethe, Heine, Platen, and Uhland, in which he endeavors to Hx his place among the coryphaei of the German poets, and a chapter on his influence as pedagogue in the best and broadest sense of that much-abused word. In the Appendix we have also twenty-three pages of hitherto unpublished poems, chiefly Gelegenheitsgedichte, of no great intrinsic worth. Riickert's correspondence gives a charming picture of his simple, idyllic home life. These letters have a literary value as the only specimens of the poet's admirable prose. On the whole, Dr. Beyer's book is the fullest and, indeed, the only real vol. cix. ? no. 225. 38</page><page sequence="11">594 Baldwin's Pre-historic Nations.

It is exceedingly annoying to the reader to be constantly informed that this point is cleared up or that poem analyzed in some previous monograph which he does not possess. Every biography should be complete in itself, so far at least as essential points are concerned. Professor Fortlage's little volume aims to give a critical survey of Ruckert's works in their logical and chronological connection, and ac complishes this purpose in an excellent manner and with truly philo sophical comprehensiveness. The Gesammtausgabe, just issued by Sauerlander at Frankfort, has been arranged with studious care, and is the first edition printed from original manuscripts preserved and corrected by Ruckert himself. All former editions have been printed from cdpies of them which did not even have the benefit of the poet's subsequent revision, and are therefore more or less defective.</page></plain_text>
