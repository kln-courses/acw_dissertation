Basel: Pharos, 1966. S. Fr. 30 The bulk of this doctoral thesis is an exhaustive and painstaking analysis in terms of style elements of the 428 Middle-Sepik suspension hooks with anthropomorphic front-facing faces in the collection of the Ethnological Museum at Basle. The analysis probably represents the high point of what can be achieved purely by studying museum material; the shape, dimensions and proportions of the nose, mouth, eyes and facial surface are meticulously considered in turn. For instance seventy-four different nose shapes are identi- fied, and their distribution in the sample compared to that of the other features similarly considered in detail, from which several clear groups emerge. So far so good; as far as I know nothing has been attempted in such detail and on such a scale in the way of stylistic analysis before. Having established that there exist several different styles of face whose elements are sometimes combined, Dr Schefold then assumes on not very clear grounds, that these styles necessarily had different origins. There follows much ingen- ious argument about which is likely to be the older, material from beyond the Sepik area being considered. What is so frustrating is that there is no consideration at all given to the possible function of the different styles within the cultures concerned. Iatmul, Tshwosh and Tchambri who provide the bulk of the hooks considered, have at least three major and sharply differentiated styles for the anthropomorphic face, each firmly linked to a class of objects or masks used in ceremony. The carvers of hooks draw on these styles for their productions with far greater freedom than would be permissible for the ceremonial objects themselves, as Schefold emphatically demonstrates. Surely the dyna- mics of style within the culture are an essential preliminary to comparisons between cultures? The English summary is not very helpful. ANTHONY FORGE</page></plain_text>
