<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AFFIRMATIVE ASPECT OF SCEPTICISM What has concluded, that we should conclude about it?--WILLIAM JAMES. MANY positivists would no doubt define metaphysics as a re- current fallacy of exaggeration. Its usual practice has been to translate some vivid but adventitious feature of existence into a universal law or an immutable substance. Thus it has had the dual effect of promoting exact inquiry by providing it with fruit- ful leading principles, and of retarding its progress by perpetuat- ing obsolete dogmas. The last few decades have seen a steady criticism, not only of the conclusions but of the method and inten- tion of traditional philosophy. The result, if not the premise, of that criticism has been a general distrust of speculative thought, so that everything metaphysical is nowadays inherently suspect.</page><page sequence="2">598 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY This, of course, is to some extent as it should be. Ours is an age of unsurpassed critical acumen, not only in art but in science; and it has become plain that an exhaustive awareness of the possi- ble ways of conceiving a work of art or a scientific theory does not necessarily diminish one 's productive powers, although it often inhibits them in that it makes their expression more circumspect. It is at any rate no longer novel to contend that the creative process indissolubly involves criticism: in literature, for example, the critical acuity of the best contemporary writers has in many cases resulted in a diminution of quantity but not of quality. Nevertheless the persistent concern of current thought with the form of what man in his best moments can accomplish-with ques- tions of method and technique, what some critics call "strategy" -is probably an implicit, largely unconscious condemnation of its content. For contemporary developments in philosophy and in esthetic criticism have this much in common: both show an incli- nation to reject moral and factual considerations entirely, over- estimating the degree in which form can be disengaged from sub- ject-matter and significantly examined apart from it. Noteworthy in this connection are the many current references to a "new failure of nerve." The parallel between our own age and the Hellenistic period is indeed very suggestive, and truer, perhaps, than is at first apparent. For the new failure of nerve, like the old one, is marked not only by dogmatism and by various religious and secular forms of idolatry, but also by a condition that, ostensibly at least, is the reverse of dogmatism: an intense desire to abdicate belief entirely. In practice, of course, it is a desire that can never succeed; the tension it induces must sooner or later be expended-hence the many recent (and also historical) cases of sudden, dramatic conversion. For it is a striking thing about scepticism that its historical affinities are to a remarkable degree mystical and religious, as our own age, the Hellenistic age, and the Renaissance all seem to suggest. It is hardly surprising that these periods are at once addicted to scepticism and highly susceptible to irrational belief. Knowl- edge is predominantly a matter of adjustment; it makes future adjustments possible and it also denotes an anterior adjustment: it is the outcome of that tension between doubt and belief which is the mainspring of every inquiry. However, genuine doubt is not something that can be arbitrarily invoked and disposed of; there must be an appropriate empirical (or in some sense practical) occasion for it, and without that occasion knowledge is unattain- able. The point is, of course, that in times of rapid cultural change, the suitable occasions for doubt multiply and sometimes</page><page sequence="3">AFFIRMATIVE ASPECT OF SCEPTICISM 599 become oppressive. Such periods are the most productive intel- lectually because spiritually, and even practically, they are the most hazardous; they heighten the possibility of, and in a sense the need for, creative effort. The alternative to that effort is a kind of psychic surrender which may take either a sceptical or a mystical form, but is in either case a comprehensive, radical form of denial, an abandonment of practicable standards. Of course, these alternatives are not reciprocally exclusive. The Renaissance, for example, which certainly had its share of fanatics, produced also, in Montaigne, Descartes, and especially Pascal, a kind of conservative scepticism which stresses the value and necessity of belief while confessing (or implying) the in- escapable insufficiency of its grounds. It is an attitude that, aside from its intrinsic merits, is probably the only possible one for an historian, since the interpretive study of thought is mainly an attempt to understand ideas in relation to their non-intellectual determinants. Pragmatism and Freudian psychology both support the view that ideas are never fully intelligible in terms of themselves or of what they ostensibly refer to; that they represent not only facts (upon occasion), but also both the manner and degree in which the need for belief and knowledge is felt. This assertion as it now stands is no doubt vague; only scrupulous research can give it a more exact meaning. Meanwhile, however, it promises to be a fruitful assumption; for science, like every expression of human judgment, is largely a process in which premonition-a kind of animal clairvoyance which perhaps denotes an unconscious primi- tive affinity between ourselves and our environment-is clarified, corrected, and at the same time refined and enlarged. II Modern philosophy exhibits a passion for certainty and ex- actitude which is not unprecedented in the history of thought but is probably unequalled: so coercive a passion that it often leads to an entire abandonment of the quest, to a retreat into dogmatism, or nihilism, or pure formalism. It is manifest, for the most part, as a kind of intellectual parsimony, a reluctance to concede any assumptions whatever, or to regard more than an irreducible minimum of experience as veridical. It is, among other things, a predilection for simplicity whose consequences have been im- measurably complex; and its chief error is the reductive fallacy: in many quarters now mentality is synonymous with behavior and the whole of existence is confused with its overt public aspects.</page><page sequence="4">600 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY It is obvious that frugality of this sort can prove repressive even from a purely logical standpoint: All of us who earlier were inclined to say that unverifiable statements are meaningless-and I include myself-have since learned to be more careful. This dictum is unclear; and in the most readily suggested interpretations of it, is too sweeping to be plausible. . . . Such reference to verifiability as essential to meaning is only a roundabout way of pointing out that unless you are somehow prepared to recognize the factuality you assert, in case that factual- ity should be, or could be, presented to you, your verbal expression is not a matter-of-fact statement because it affirms nothing intelligible. Any condi- tions of verification over and above this one requirement that a matter-of-fact assertion must have empirical sense-whether these further considerations be "practical" or "theoretical" -are irrelevant to the question of meaningful- ness. . . . Clearly the belief in other consciousness than one's own satisfies this one requirement of the meaningful; that there must be some criterion for recognition, some sense content indicative of what is meant. [C. I. Lewis, this JOURNAL, Vol. XXXVIII (1941), p. 232.] What is impressive here is the intentional equivocation. Professor Lewis is saying that any theory which proposes a single standard applicable to every individual case is likely to be either meaning- less, or nugatory, or false. Every subject-matter and every ac- tivity is in some measure autonomous; it has characteristics and hence criteria that are unique. It is just this, however, that the modern philosophy of retrenchment prefers to ignore. Aiming at a sparse economy, it often regards the whole currency of ideas and meanings as of a single denomination. In ethics, for example, the bias of intellectualism is especially strong, and always has been. The assumption underlying most discussions is that the status of values is improved once they are shown to be in some sense factual, or to have factual affinities; yet we are continually told that it has been a pervasive philosophic error to confuse values with facts. Obviously, the modern in- clination to deplore the gap between values and facts, and the traditional tendency to obscure it, both stem from the same atti- tude. Were that attitude to change-that prejudice in favor of knowledge or intellect as such-the problem of value would change also, and would perhaps disappear entirely. Certainly those who claim that ideals are illusory because they are incapable of "proof" are themselves sentimentalists of the worst kind. Any standard according to which all standards are false must itself be spurious. C. W. Morris has said that a sceptic (he meant a sceptic of the Humian sort) is usually a disappointed rationalist, a person who denies the possibility of knowledge be- cause knowledge hasn't the kind or degree of certainty he wishes it to have. A cynic, then, the moral equivalent of a sceptic, is</page><page sequence="5">AFFIRMATIVE ASPECT OF SCEPTICISM 601 really a disappointed Platonist: he, too, attempts to apply an in- applicable standard, and his prejudice is fooled by experience. The relative status of values is in no way deplorable and ap- pears so only from a perverse standpoint, its importance being that it implies the virtue of resisting the pervasive tendency toward arbitrary or coercive unification. However, although the fact of diversity is undeniable, it is in itself insufficient ground for a philosophy. The trouble, of course, is that the fact is too often elevated into a principle, the principle of pluralism, which, when it contends that everything is basically unique and incommensura- ble, is in effect a negation of principles. Knowledge presumes the existence of some kind of unity; indeed it is an endless process of unification. The key to that unity is to be found in scepticism, in the element of affirmation that is in every explicit avowal of doubt. Modern scepticism tends to be either a variation of Hume or mere obstinate incredulity. It is often a moral malady, a paraly- sis or arbitrary withholding of belief, and as such is never entirely explicable on logical grounds. The most notable expressions of scepticism, however, are of a different sort: they are implicit theories of reality. We are aware that every method, in so far as it is a determinate policy, is also a metaphysic: scepticism, in stressing the relative character of knowledge, presumes the rela- tional character of existence; the view that certainty and exacti- tude may be approached but never realized implies that nature is inexhaustibly complex because it is infinitely interrelated. The metaphysical sense of the word "dialectic" is nowadays in just disrepute, yet there is still much to recommend a dialectical view of reality, provided we purge the term of its anthropomorphic associations. For what Hegel's elaborate insistence on dialectic amounts to, fundamentally, is a recognition of the fact of universal contingency, and of what it implies. The implications of that fact are at once sceptical and romantic. Unlimited contingency means that certainty and exactitude are forever prevented, although they remain governing ideals. This is the main metaphysical point, not only in Hegel (who seems at times to abandon it), but also in Bradley and Whitehead. Its corollary is that thought is an in- terminable kind of adventure, an endless revision of current beliefs, a continual critique of abstractions. Obviously, this view has a strong ontological flavor: if thought is largely a matter of showing how current beliefs always somehow oversimplify the truth, then it follows that knowledge is a special, partial perspective on an intricate totality which must be seen piecemeal and with a bias to be seen at all.</page><page sequence="6">602 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The virtue of this view is its inclusiveness. It is an unlimited admission of variety, of plurality, and of spontaneity-and, in that sense, of freedom-but at the same time it preserves the possibility of knowledge. The world it depicts is at once a multiple and a unit. III Differences exist, of course, only by virtue of relationships, and are always known in terms of them. Hence the defect of plural- ism is its failure to see that the standpoint of method is necessarily one of unity. What distinguishes any object is its relation to other objects: individuality is the unique relation of an object to the rest of existence, just as the specific meaning of a word is its significant relation to the rest of discourse. Unity in this sense is not merely linguistic or methodological; the character of discourse does to some extent correspond to that of reality. The significance of experimentation, for example, is that it is a method of discovery as well as of verification, which introduces an inexhaustible novelty into experience by bringing things into effective conjunction with one another. There is a comment by Peirce on James's Psychology that is noteworthy in this connection: "Through feelings we become acquainted with things" [p. 222]. This seems to me to be at the root of a good deal of bad metaphysics. On the contrary, the feelings are matters of indifference (in their qualities). It is by the reactions of ourselves upon things and of their parts on one another that we become acquainted with things. [R. B. Perry, The Thought and Character of Witliam James, Vol. II, p. 107.] The comment crystallizes the dispute between monism and plural- ism. There is on the one hand the stress on concreteness, im- mediacy, and diversity; and, on the other, Peirce's realism, which emphasizes the structure of experience, the laws of its develop- ment, as the essence of its objectivity. The concrete, spontaneous variety of nature is discovered and heightened, for Peirce, by ra- tional operations which also disclose its intelligible structure. It is in this sense that diversity is always rendered as an aspect of unity. Thought has the effect of multiplying both distinctions and relations. It is an endless process of applying familiar symbols to novel situations in which old terms assume new meanings or else are defined with greater precision than ever before. Every improvement in knowledge is an improvement also in method and in language, which spells progress in the delicacy and exactitude with which words may be used. We are by now accustomed to the view that knowledge is simply the successful application of a</page><page sequence="7">AFFIRMATIVE ASPECT OF SCEPTICISM 603 system of verbal or mathematical symbols which are significant not only because they refer to experience but also because they refer to each other. The point is that their meanings, as against their designative and imaginative properties, consist exclusively of their mutal relations. The value of a symbol as a medium of knowledge and a tool of discovery is a consequence of its function of defining an object and not merely denoting one; and a symbol is a definition by virtue of its significant connection with other symbols-just as the objec- tivity of any aspect of experience (and every experience is objec- tive in that it is a possible sign of its determinants) lies in its explicit relation to the rest of experience. It follows that meaning is a function of knowledge. As knowledge develops precision and scope, language acquires clarity and refinement. It evolves through successive stages of internal elaboration in which its terms become increasingly dependent on each other both for meanings and for their status in the vast system of which they are members. Since the meaning of a term is the sum of its implications, it is definitive only to the extent that it embodies definitive knowledge of its object. This means that abstraction-the act of naming- is at best not so much a matter of disengaging a thing from its contextual relations as of gradually exposing the intricacy and full extent of those relations. The trouble is, of course, that we characterize some of these relations by omitting others: hence the idealist fallacy which equates a necessary incompleteness with positive falsity. The paradox, however, is that as language grows in abstractness it grows also in power as an organ of concrete awareness-as an organ, that is, of perception, discrimination, and judgment. It is apparent from what has already been said that all knowl- edge is known and can be phrased in terms of how one thing acts upon another. The abstractive fallacy-which in one form or another is inseparable from the very business of thinking-is the attempt to characterize an object apart from the context in which it acts and is acted upon. It follows, then, that nature is unitary in this sense: no single fact about it can be affirmed except in terms of an indefinite number of other facts, since every fact-whether by a fact we mean an observed condition or its formulation-is ineluctably relational. Every individual quality is relational (and reducible) because it characterizes a natural event and is therefore an internal phase of some interaction. New qualities appear as aspects of the interaction of objects whose properties are to some extent already known; but every object is a hypo- thetical entity. Hence every factual assertion is hypothetical, too,</page><page sequence="8">604 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and provisional. The facts themselves must be seen as limited manifestations of a universe that is inexhaustibly complex, whose nature can be known approximately but never fully (since it is never fully actualized), though it is progressively disclosed both by human intervention and by the dynamics of its own inexorable development-the former being simply an episode in the latter. We have seen that the most notable feature of knowledge is that it is systematic: in inquiry, the vast pattern of implications that comprises discourse is endlessly developed and enriched. This wouldn't be so unless there were a definite sense in which nature itself is a system. For Peirce, the significance of the ex- perimental method is twofold: it reflects the fruitful, purposive interaction of thought and reality, and it implies a basic corre- spondence between reality and discourse. That correspondence lies in the fact that both possess continuity because both are unified structures capable of infinite internal elaboration. Potentiality, the scope for novelty, is inexhaustible in both; but it is merely the obverse of contingency (just as the obverse of spontaneity, of freedom, is hazard): it exists because everything in nature is the end term of an infinite series of possible relationships. The fact of novelty, however, must not blind us to the im- portance of continuity. The novelty that emerges from the re- organization of familiar elements must have a discoverable relation to its determinants and a perceptible resemblance to the past. Otherwise it would altogether defy recognition and, therefore, perception. The present is distinguishable from the past largely because it can be understood in terms of it, that is, because in some degree it resembles it. And this continuity in experience reflects an analogous continuity in discourse. The poet, Hart Crane, de- fending the "objectivity" of modern poetry, once argued that the "logic of metaphor" is the genetic basis of speech, hence of con- sciousness and thought. Of course, like most poets, Crane was making an extravagant claim for his art; but there is a good deal of truth in his contention. Words obviously acquire scope by be- coming metaphors of their etymological meanings. If language were not always in some measure figurative, it would altogether lack flexibility: few words would be applicable in more than one context. For a metaphor is simply an imperfect comparison, and in so far as thought is an attempt to apply old symbols to new situa- tions, it partakes of the nature of poetry. What we call imagina- tion is perhaps just this capacity for spanning the gap-or rather, for eliciting the continuity-between the old and the new, the familiar and the novel, what is uniform, standard, stereotyped and what is unique: in other words, the abstract and the concrete, the</page><page sequence="9">AFFIRMATIVE ASPECT OF SCEPTICISM 605 ideal and the real, form and substance. If imagination is this faculty, then it is plain that science no less than art is an imagina- tive product. Critical reflection continually shows a resemblance between such seemingly disparate phenomena as science and art. Indeed, progress in knowledge seems to consist largely in discovering rela- tionships among things previously regarded as unrelated. Ein- stein's achievement, for instance, was to show that space, time, and energy are not as mutually distinguishable as had been sup- posed; that, rather, they are functional aspects of one another. Similarly, the work of Mead and Dewey has refuted the notion of a unique, private self, insulated from the world and society, and has shown that what distinguishes human mentality is a result of its interaction with other mentalities; that personality is the unique relation of an individual to other individuals. Again, Freud's investigations imply not only the effectual immortality of the past, its ineluctable immanence in the present, but also the respect in which the mind itself must be conceived as a unit: as a network of symbolic relations whose end terms are logical and sensory and also conative. There are other less reputable examples, such as Gestalt psy- chology, but the point is that to examine anything profitably is necessarily to consider it an aspect of something more inclusive than itself. Doubt is relevant and constructive when it is a par- ticularized response to that fact, which is the corollary of scepti- cism and its objective equivalent. IV The trouble with modern culture is that it lacks a sense of the unity implied by the very capacity to doubt. Henry Adams has suggested to what extent the world has been multiplied and di- vided since the middle ages; science and economy, he contends, have been the twin agents of dissolution. Certainly capitalism has transformed society from a more or less stable hierarchy into a flux of hostile classes which are themselves divided by conflicting interests and habits of antagonism. Similarly, when Augustinian- ism was revived as the dominant religious concept, claiming that salvation depends on a private communion between man and God, its effect was to unravel the institutional fabric still further; and in philosophy, dualism and subjectivism expressed the growing sense (and fact) of isolation. Moreover, just as the growth of democracy has too often meant the liberation of oppressive eco- nomic forces, so the modern solicitude for personal freedom and freedom of conscience reflects in large measure an absence of</page><page sequence="10">606 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY conscience, apathy, and multiplicity, the alienation of men from one another. It is illuminating in this connection that Marx, like Adams and other romantics, preferred the middle ages to any other period in history. Adams seems, nevertheless, to have missed the rather obvious point that the twin sources of modern multiplicity have been equal sources of unity; for the world is unified now in a way and degree that it never was before. Technology has meant mass production, and science has produced an immense general growth of specializa- tion. The result has been a steady diminution of that primitive freedom which consists of practical (or even intellectual) inde- pendence. The upshot is that while our moral attitudes and tactics have been progressively desocialized, the need for collaborative action and for the effective use of social institutions has proportionately grown. Salvation in our time, as in the middle ages, must be a collective event, although the danger therefore confronts us that, like our enemies, we will abandon the method of intelligence and of voluntary agreement for the method of coercion. In a time of intensified conflict, misunderstanding, and di- versity doubt tends to be gratuitous and somewhat excessive; and the injunction to doubt seems perverse, a symptom rather than a cure. Nevertheless, in a universe of unlimited contingency, scepticism has a permanent place, a more significant role, perhaps, than any other single doctrine or method. That role is to formu- late the irreducible enduring fact of uncertainty and hazard, and by clarifying the limitations of the moment to define and enhance its possibilities.
