<plain_text><page sequence="1">OTTO JESPERSEN, LEONARD BLOOMFIELD, AND AMERICAN STRUCTURAL LINGUISTICS JULIA S. FALK Michigan State University Otto Jespersen and his work were well known and widely recognized in American linguistics during early decades of the 20th century, particularly by Leonard Bloomfield. This study investigates Bloomfield's references to Jespersen's works on the structure and history of English, the nature of language change, and foreign language teaching, and finds that Bloomfield's few criticisms of Jespersen's writings were concentrated in the brief period 1922-1927 and were focused almost entirely on issues of science and method as Bloomfield had come to define them at the time. The study further documents and offers explanations for widespread underrepresentation of Jespersen's work by American structuralists in the 1940s and 1950s and by historians of American structural linguistics. It concludes with a brief account of the renewed interest in Jespersen during recent decades.* 1. INTRODUCTION. During much of his professional life, the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen (1860-1943) was well known and well received in the United States. His works were widely cited by American scholars, he lectured in the United States in 1904 and again in 1909-10, and he was among the first Eu- ropean scholars to be elected an honorary member of the Linguistic Society of America. And yet Jespersen is all but invisible in histories that cover lin- guistics in America during the first half of the 20th century. Jespersen appears not at all in American structuralism (Hymes &amp; Fought 1981), the most comprehensive account currently available for linguistics in the United States from the early years of the 20th century to 1957 and beyond. In Linguistics in America 1769-1924 (Andresen 1990), Jespersen's name occurs only in a list of scholars (143) cited from William Labov's dismissive account of an early 'social group of linguists' who 'relied almost entirely upon an in- tuitive explanation of a few anecdotal events drawn from their own general knowledge' (Labov 1972:268-69). The discussions in both Andresen and Labov are about William Dwight Whitney (1827-1894); Jespersen is mentioned merely in passing. More recently, in books and articles published in conjunction with the cel- ebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Leonard Bloomfield (1887- 1949), little reference is made to Jespersen. For example, in the dozen essays about Bloomfield collected by Robert A. Hall, Jr. (1987) there is no discussion of Jespersen. Jespersen's name appears twice in the volume, once in Hall's Prefatory Remarks in a list of scholars who contributed to 'the positive de- velopments of the last hundred years' (x), and once in a reference by Bloomfield himself, in a passage about sound change from a 1925 letter to Edward Sapir (Hockett 1987:53), discussed below. Likewise, Hall's 1990 biography of Bloom- * I am grateful to Charles Hockett, John Joseph, and Terry Langendoen for the helpful comments, insightful criticisms, detailed suggestions, and important references they generously provided at several stages in the development of this paper. 465</page><page sequence="2">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) field contains just two peripheral references to Jespersen: a statement that Bloomfield 'would probably not have accepted ian] essentially Jespersenian view' on idiolects that Hall proposes (49) and a quotation from Frederic Gomes Cassidy that Jespersen and Bloomfield were the two figures who had most influenced his own study of language (89). These works about American linguistics in the first half of the 20th century assign little or no role to Otto Jespersen. In contrast, Leonard Bloomfield's linguistic publications from 1911 until 1945 contain numerous and repeated references to Jespersen, perhaps more than to any other scholar. In Bloom- field's Language (1933), Jespersen is the most frequent reference. 2. OTTO JESPERSEN.1 From the time of his matriculation as an undergraduate student at the age of seventeen, Jespersen's academic career was associated almost entirely with the University of Copenhagen. Following receipt of his master's degree in 1887 (with French as his major subject, Latin and English as minors), he traveled in England, France, and Germany, visiting scholars at Oxford, Paris, Leipzig, and Berlin before returning to Copenhagen in 1888 to teach English and French at private schools while pursuing doctoral studies. His dissertation on the English case system was published in 1891, and in 1893 he was appointed professor of English at the University of Copenhagen, a position he retained until his retirement at age 65 in 1925. Jespersen's publi- cations over these years ranged from early work on language change (e.g. 1894), phonetics (e.g. 1897-99), and foreign language teaching (1904) through more general linguistic works (e.g. 1922, 1924, 1925b) to the monumental study of English (1909-49) on which he was working at the time of his death in 1943. He remained professionally active throughout his retirement, convening and chairing the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Spring 1930 in Geneva to consider 'the cause of an International Auxiliary Language (1931:774; also see Larsen 1989), serving as president of the Fourth Interna- tional Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936, and continuing to publish extensively (e.g. 1933a, 1937, 1941). In the first decade of the twentieth century Jespersen twice visited the United States, lecturing in 1904 at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis and during 1909-10 at the University of California and at Columbia University, where he was presented with an honorary degree. He was well known among his American contemporaries, and at the third annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America, held in Cambridge, MA, December 27-30, 1926, Jespersen was one of the first six international scholars elected to honorary LSA mem- bership (Lg. 3.36-37, 1927).2 In an age when linguistics in Europe was frequently organized into move- ments and schools, from the neogrammarians to the Cercle linguistique de Prague, Jespersen was a markedly independent scholar. An explanation he once l For biographical information on Jespersen, see Haislund 1943, Hjelmslev 1942-43, and Juul &amp; Nielsen 1989. 2 The others were Albert Debrunner (1884-1958), Antoine Meillet (1866-1936), Paul Rivet (1876- 1958), Jacob Wackernagel (1853-1938), and Henry Cecil Kennedy Wyld (1870-1945). 466</page><page sequence="3">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD offered for his shift from the study of law to the study of language also char- acterizes his lifelong research and writing: 'I wanted to go my own way and not to have my opinions dictated to me from outside' (1925a:2). This intellectual independence, along with exceptional breadth of interest and depth of study, makes Jespersen's work difficult to summarize. His positions are often original, his arguments are frequently complex, and his analyses are sometimes subtle. Upon retirement from his university post, Jespersen described his work: '...I have been chiefly a linguistic investigator, laying stress both on the living language and its historical evolution' (1925a:10). Thus, early in his career, in the closing decade of the 19th century when many linguists were immersed entirely in historical study, Jespersen also focused attention on living lan- guages, both in his studies of phonetics and in his efforts to reform the teaching of modern foreign languages. Later, when others were emphasizing the syn- chronic description of contemporary languages, Jespersen continued to draw upon historical information, as for his Modern English grammar on historical principles (1909-49), and yet he remained 'firmly convinced ... that a correct apprehension of the essential nature of language can only be obtained when the study is based in the first place on direct observation of living speech' (1924:7). Throughout his life and his work, there was a balance between the particular and the general: 'Apart from the observation of particular details I was also drawn to general points of view' (1925a:5). This characteristic is especially evident in his work on grammar, of which he said: 'To anyone who finds that grammar is a worthless finicking with trifles, I would reply that life consists of little things; the important matter is to see them largely' (1925a: 10). Jespersen sought 'without neglecting investigation into the details of the languages known to me, to give due prominence to the great principles underlying the grammars of all languages' (1924:344). But the details-the little things-mattered, too. Jespersen was careful in his choices: 'I have laid especial stress on the choice of good illustrative examples', using 'sentences which are in themselves in- teresting and valuable' (1933c:304-305). Indeed, 'I always like to move in the concrete everyday world and try to find out rules for sentences as these are actually spoken and understood in practical life' (1933c:322). This focus on the everyday world, the practical life, was surely one factor contributing to Jespersen's wide reading audience. Popu- lar journals described his books Language and The philosophy of grammar as 'fascinating'. Jespersen wrote for the educated public and, of course, for other scholars. The most technical of his works, and therefore probably the least representative, was Analytic syntax (1937). Jespersen himself was aware of the difficulty: 'I sincerely hope that fellow-students will not let themselves be de- terred by the look of my seemingly abstruse formulas, but will study them closely enough to realize their value in making it possible to gain a deeper insight into grammatical constructions in general' (1937:xxi).3 3 Jespersen's formulas remain an issue even for modern readers, who are more accustomed to formal notation than were his contemporaries. James McCawley describes the notational scheme in Analytic syntax as 'disconcertingly difficult to learn to read and write' (1991:119). 467</page><page sequence="4">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) For Jespersen, 'The real research student ... is constantly thinking of the way in which his own labours may be made useful to others and how through the publication of his results he may promote the interests of everyone engaged in similar studies' (1920:89-90). The American linguist Leonard Bloomfield was among those to whom Jespersen's labours were useful. 3. LEONARD BLOOMFIELD ON OTTO JESPERSEN.4 My primary criteria in se- lecting from among Bloomfield's works those to review for references to Jes- persen were that the publications were accessible and of likely interest to a broad readership among the American linguists of Bloomfield's time and to the historians of linguistics who followed.5 3.1. BLOOMFIELD'S EARLY WORKS: 1909-1921. Bloomfield's linguistic pub- lications began in 1909 with his dissertation and then consisted largely of re- views until An introduction to the study of language appeared in 1914. The dissertation, 'A semasiologic differentiation in Germanic secondary ablaut' (Bloomfield 1909/1910), is by today's standards a curious work: Bloomfield provides an extensive list of words in modern Germanic languages in order to 'illustrate [the] general principle' (250) of 'onomatopoetic vowel variations' (247), in order to 'give us some help in penetrating into the mystery of the "original" or IE. ablaut' (248). The few pages of text preceding the word list are filled with 'mentalistic' phrases of the kind Bloomfield was later to reject so strongly in the work of others, including that of Jespersen (see ?3.2 below); Germanic languages and their speakers have a 'feeling for vowel grades and vowel variations' (246), are 'characterized by a vivid sensibility to a few ablaut variations' (246), have an 'independent feeling ... for onomatopoetic variants' (248) and an 'old inherent Germanic sense for vowel pitch' (249). The dissertation appears to follow arguments put forward by William Dwight Whitney in Language and the study of language (1867), although Bloomfield does not cite Whitney here. The strong credits Bloomfield assigns to Whitney 4 For materials on Bloomfield, I am of course indebted to Charles F. Hockett and to Robert A. Hall, Jr., particularly for Hockett 1970, Hall 1987, and Hall 1990. I cite the reprintings in Hockett 1970 whenever possible for the convenience of the reader. For a comprehensive bibliography of Bloomfield's lifetime publications, see Hockett &amp; Hall 1987. 5 In general, I do not include reviews and articles in languages other than English, in journals with primarily European circulation, or in festschrifts. Also excluded are most of Bloomfields historical Germanic studies, as well as the foreign-language textbooks he prepared toward the end of his career. I did review a sample of Bloomfield's work on Tagalog, Ilocano, and Algonquian languages (see Goddard 1987); I found no references to Jespersen in Bloomfield 1917, 1939b, 1942c, 1946, 1958, 1962. In addition, Hockett searched through the Bloomfield Philippine and Algonquian materials in his own comprehensive collection and, in a 1992 personal communication, writes: 'I can assure you that there are, indeed, no references to Jespersen anywhere.' There may be ref- erences to Jespersen in the historical Germanic work and perhaps in the foreign-language textbooks, and I assume full responsibility for any omissions of pertinent material that may have resulted from my choice of selection criteria. I was guided, but not limited, by the list in Bloch (1949:91, n. 14) and the contents selected by Hockett 1970. I provide this detail because I believe that in historical investigations it is important to set forth the materials that have been examined. Without such information, it is difficult for readers to evaluate the scope of the findings or to compare the findings to other studies. 468</page><page sequence="5">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD just five years later, in Bloomfield 1914a, lend some credence to the possibility that Whitney's work was also influential for Bloomfield at this earlier time. In his discussion on the origin of language (421-35), Whitney concluded: 'There was doubtless a period in the process of speech when its whole structure was palpably onomatopoetic; but not a long one: the onomatopoetic stage was only a stepping-stone to something higher and better' (433). Although Bloomfield soon reduced his own commitment to the onomatopoeic 'principle',6 he, perhaps even more than Whitney, saw language as moving in the direction of 'something higher and better'. Indeed, Bloomfield maintained this view throughout his career, and he often turned for support to Otto Jes- persen's treatise on the progressive character of language change, Progress in language (1894).7 Among Bloomfield's first reviews are laudatory comments on the work of two of his teachers. Bloomfield 1911 reviews a work by his doctoral dissertation director Francis A. Wood of the University of Chicago, while 1912b praises a German language textbook written by Eduard Prokosch, who first inducted Bloomfield into work in linguistics at the University of Wisconsin (see Bloom- field's 1938 obituary of Prokosch, Lg. 14.311-12). In the former review Bloom- field cites Jespersen's Progress in language as his only reference (Hockett 1970:29, n. 3); in the latter, Jespersen's How to teach a foreign language is one of two works cited (Hockett 1970:30, n. 1). Progress appears again as one of a handful of references in another 1912 review (Bloomfield 1912a/Hockett 1970:37). The major work of this period, following these reviews, is An introduction to the study of language (1914a), which Bloomfield describes in his Preface as 'intended ... for the general reader and for the student who is entering upon linguistic work. Its purpose is the same, accordingly, as that of Whitney's Language and the Study of Language and The Life and Growth of Language ...' (v). There are few footnotes or references to other scholars within the text, but, as he was to do in 1933, Bloomfield notes in the Preface that his work is 'a presentation of the accepted doctrine, not even avoiding well-used standard examples', and he refers the reader to 'the books mentioned in Chapter Ten', which 'I may therefore name as my immediate sources' (vi). Chapter Ten is 'The study of language', and here Bloomfield provides a brief chronicle of 'The origin of linguistic science', concluding with Whitney, earlier identified as 'the greatest of English-speaking linguistic scholars' (308, n. 1), who 'applied to the historic phase a remarkable clearness and truth of com- prehension, to be appreciated in a field from which mystic vagueness and hap- 6 Just five years after the dissertation, Bloomfield 1914a says: 'The connection between sound and meaning ... cannot even in its origin have been a direct one' (15), and 'The range of onomato- poeia is thus at best very limited, and where it occurs it can take rank only as one of the many forms of associational habit that occur in language' (81). 7 In his chapter on 'Progress or decay?' in Language (1922), Jespersen devotes a paragraph to Whitney's views on the subject, referring to him as '(a]mong those who ... half-heartedly refused to accept the [19th-century] downhill theory [of language change] to its full extent' but noting that Whitney's 'writings show a certain hesitation to make up his mind on this question' (323). 469</page><page sequence="6">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) hazard theory have been slow to recede' (312).8 The bibliography is incorporated into the second section of this chapter, 'How to study linguistics': 'The beginning of linguistics is best made with one of Whitney's [two] books' (315). Although the 'beginning of linguistics' is to be made with Whitney, Bloom- field recommends that the student begin 'the study of language' with self- observation and 'an elementary study of phonetics' (313), followed by 'the historic development of language ... through the medium of English' (314). Here the various primers and readers of Henry Sweet are listed, along with other works including Jespersen's Lehrbuch der Phonetik. For historical develop- ment 'one may first read: Otto Jespersen, Growth and Structure of the English Language' (314). Concluding the section on readings in historical linguistics: 'A highly suggestive book on the history of language is Otto Jespersen, Progress in Language, with Special Reference to English' (316). In addition, Jespersen's How to teach a foreign language is one of the two main references given at the end of the previous chapter, on 'The teaching of languages', the only other chapter in this book to include bibliographic references. It is perhaps worth noting that in Bloomfield's Index of Authors there are four page references to Jespersen. Only Chaucer equals this number; no one surpasses it.9 The Introduction was '[s]urely written largely at The University of Illinois, and before Bloomfield's departure for Europe; thus mainly in 1913' (Hockett 1970:44). Upon return from his postdoctoral studies in Germany in 1914, Bloomfield joined the American Philological Association and presented papers at the annual meetings in 1914 and 1916 (Hockett 1970:61). Both Bloomfield 1914b and Bloomfield 1916 reflect his European studies in their references, with a preponderance citing German scholars of the 19th century. In 'Sentence and word' (1914b), however, we do find that 'Jespersen's Progress in language 8 Bloomfield's treatment of arbitrariness here (1914a:81-82) is almost certainly a reflection of this indebtedness to Whitney: 'the utterance with material content ['words of ordinary speech'] depends for its form entirely on the habits of the speaker, which he shares with his speech-com- munity. These habits are in a sense arbitrary, differing for the different communities and changing gradually in the course of time.' Although Bloomfield does not explicitly cite Whitney in this passage, compare it to i... every vocable was to us an arbitrary and conventional sign: arbitrary, because any one of a thousand other vocables could have been just as easily learned by us and associated with the same idea; conventional, because the one we acquired had its sole ground and sanction in the consenting usage of the community of which we formed a part' (Whitney 1867:14). That Bloomfield in 1914a named Whitney 1867 as an 'immediate source' indicates that he may have drawn directly on Whitney for the concept of the arbitrary sign. Koerner 1989 seems to imply that Bloomfield's source for the concept of arbitrariness in Bloomfield 1924 and 13loomfield 1933 was the 1922 second edition of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique generale, but Koer- ner's passage (439) is open to several interpretations. Aarsleff 1979 traces the concept to John Locke's 1689 Essay concerning human understanding, presenting 'the reassertion of the arbitrar- iness of the linguistic sign' in the late 19th century as 'a re-play' of the 17th century (97-98). 9 Bloomfield was not alone at this time in recommending Jespersen's works to beginning students of linguistics. Reviewing the Introduction, George M. Bolling (1917) says of Chapter Ten: 'To the books mentioned in it, I should like to add Otto Jespersen, Phonetische Grundfragen (Leipzig, 1904), and A Modem English Grammar on Historical Principles (Heidelberg, 1909-1914 [the first two volumes])' (Hockett 1970:54). 470</page><page sequence="7">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD is, of course, familiar' (Hockett 1970:66). From this point until 1922 there are reviews on historical Germanic studies in the Journal of English and Germanic Philology and an article in Modern Philology in 1918 on the 16th-century Ger- man word Physigunkus,'0 but the 'German' character of Bloomfield's work was balanced during these years by studies of Tagalog (Bloomfield 1917) and field work on Menominee. 3.2. FROM SAPIR'SLANGUAGETO BLOOMFIELD'S LANGUAGE: 1921-1933. This period could be considered the most productive of Bloomfield's career, both in scholarship and in other professional activities, including his major role in the founding and early work of the Linguistic Society of America. During this time he also became a spokesperson on behalf of descriptive linguistics, in- terpreting new developments to scholars in related fields, and he continued to publish articles and reviews on aspects of historical Germanic studies. The first half of the period corresponds with Bloomfield's tenure at The Ohio State University from 1921-22 through 1926-27, after which he served at the Uni- versity of Chicago until assuming his final position at Yale in 1940-41. Bloomfield's review (1922a) of Edward Sapir's Language (1921) evidences a turning-point in the development of his views on linguistics. He formally identifies himself with 'the newer trend' in linguistics which he associates with 'two critical points': (1) 'that restriction to historical work is unreasonable', and (2) 'that we are casting off our dependence on psychology', so that 'we must study people's habits of language-the way people talk-without bother- ing about the mental processes that we may conceive to underlie or accompany these habits' (Hockett 1970:92). Bloomfield places 'the mental processes' be- yond scientific investigation: they are among the 'fetishes and tabus' from which 'we are to wrench ourselves away' if we are to 'acquire a scientific outlook' (91)." The second of these critical points is further developed in the same year, when linguistic science and its methods appear as the central theme of Bloom- field's review (1922b) of Jespersen's Language: Its nature, development, and origin. He begins with: 'In every science it is demanded that the investigator understand the method of science [LB's emphasis] ... and be able to follow it, through all difficulties and seemingly endless amassments of material, consis- tently to a conclusion, good or bad' (Hockett 1970:102). There is 'a second demand, much harder to fulfil, ... that the scholar divest himself ... of all the prejudices and preconceptions of his person, of his social group, or even of all mankind' (102). 10 'Eccentric idiot' in a Swabian document; 'charlatan of learning' or 'men whose heads are full of false erudition which they use to mislead people' in a Rhenish Franconian, possibly Swabian document (Bloomfield 1918:577). " Here Bloomfield also establishes himself as a chronicler of the development of such 'newer' concepts as the distinctive feature (92) and moves beyond the Introduction in giving formal defi- nitions for terms and identifying sources for data (93-94). All of these advances develop further and become established over the next ten years, serving as preparation for the publication of Bloomfield's Language. 471</page><page sequence="8">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) Bloomfield contends that in Language Jespersen fails one or both of these demands by raising 'to a constantly recurring motif of the discussion' an er- roneous idea first proposed in just 'a single passage (on page 176)' in the much earlier, and otherwise much praised, book Progress in language: '... that the loss (by sound-change) of inflectional endings in English was conditioned upon the circumstance that these endings were no longer needed for the expression of meaning. I shall not follow this idea to its basic incompatibility with any definition of meaning that would today be tenable; it is enough to point out that, from the very beginning of linguistic study, just such ideas-referring phenomena of linguistic change to desires or needs-were tried again and again-lying as they do in the direct path of our tribal common sense; but these ideas were found wanting and discarded because they would not work with the facts' (103). For Bloomfield, the problem with Language is Jespersen's use of 'needs' and 'meanings' to account for linguistic change, and he proceeds to criticize in particular Jespersen's treatment of words involving 'sound symbolism' (103- 104). It is unclear whether Bloomfield sees Jespersen as violating the first demand of science (method) or the second (divestiture of prejudice and pre- conception), or both. He states that 'It is the first, and more general, if less noble demand of our science that Jespersen seems to me to fail', but goes on to discuss 'our tribal common sense' (103), which pertains to the second de- mand. Bloomfield raises precisely this subject again just three years later in a 1925 letter to Edward Sapir. Writing of the 'language-reactions' that set human events apart from nonhuman events, he says (Hockett 1987:53): 'All this I have from [Albert Paul] Weiss, our psychologist. The first appeal this made to me was due to the fact that in our actual work we do exclude 'mental" factors, i.e., sound-change won't stop for desires or fears. (Some of the Germans ... are going in for the theory that 'useless" sound-groups are 'more easily lost["[CFH]]-which seems to me pure bunk, rest- ing upon vague ideas of what 'usefulness" and 'meaning" etc. are. Jespersen started it, with the notion that E[nglish] case endings dropped off because no longer significant. I take it that a 'useless" case-ending is just as much and just as little meaningful and necessary to the speakers as any other part of the vocal series.)' This seems far removed from the Leonard Bloomfield whose doctoral dis- sertation repeatedly referred to 'feelings' and 'sensibilities' in discussing 'ono- matopoetic vowel variations' in modern Germanic languages. By rejecting similar views in Jespersen's work, Bloomfield indirectly repudiates this aspect of his own earlier work.'2 Yakov Malkiel (1979) makes a somewhat similar point. After identifying Jespersen as the first 'victim' of 'an increasingly iras- cible Bloomfield' in a 'succession of book reviews and position papers', Malkiel says: 'In the last analysis, Bloomfield was, clearly, attacking his own Wundtian, thoroughly mentalistic past, after having resolutely espoused behaviorism in psychology' (1979:112).13 12 Later, in his own Language, Bloomfield makes no reference to the dissertation, although he does cite others of his own works. 13 In support of such dissociation at this point in Bloomfield's career, see also John Joseph's argument that criticisms by Bloomfield of Ferdinand de Saussure's Coarzs de linguistique generale (in Bloomfield 1924) 'in point of fact ... apply quite well to Bloomfield 1914[a]', so that 'herein 472</page><page sequence="9">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD Bloomfield's powerful 1922 criticisms ofJespersen's ideas regarding meaning in Language contrast sharply with his acceptance of Jespersen's views con- cerning the progressive nature of language change. Far from challenging these views, Bloomfield extolled them (Hockett 1970:102)'4 'In his Progress in Language (1894) he showed that historical change in language is progressive, a phase of the evolution of man; that linguistic change leads to simpler, more flexible, more accurately and delicately expressive and less troublesome forms of speech. Whatever we may take to be the relation between language and thought, Jespersen's teaching means that in the history of language we can see the growth and development, through time ..., of human emotion and reason. It was the last of the great linguistic discoveries of the nineteenth century. Clearly, the claim that language change is progressive could have been sub- jected to the strictures of Bloomfield's demands of science. That it was not may be explained by the fact that Bloomfield sees Jespersen's 'progress in language' as resting not on needs or desires, not on usefulness or meaning, but rather on 'simpler, more flexible ... forms of speech'. Support for this conclu- sion can be found in Bloomfield 1926. First presented at the 1925 annual meeting of the new Linguistic Society of America (Hockett 1970:128), then published in the second volume of the So- ciety's journal Language, 'A set of postulates for the science of language' (Bloomfield 1926) is explicitly modelled on 'Weiss's set of postulates for psy- chology' (Hockett 1970:128, n. 2). Not only does the postulational method 'further the study of language, because it forces us to state explicitly whatever we assume, to define our terms, and to decide what things may exist indepen- dently and what things are interdependent,' but it is also necessary so that '[c]ertain errors can be avoided or corrected' (Hockett 1970:128). Among such errors, Bloomfield specifically cites the 'notion' that 'some forms have less meaning than others and are therefore more subject to phonetic change' (128, n.3). This is the error for which he criticized Jespersen, both in the 1922 review of Language and the 1925 letter to Sapir, but here Bloomfield does not identify may lie a motive for the ambiguous nature of this review' (1989:46). (Joseph cites Bloomfield's review of Saussure as 1923, as does Koerner 1989, a not uncommon error apparently taken from a misprint in Hockett [1970:106]. The date on the issue of the Modern language journal in which the review appears is 1924; it is recorded correctly in Hockett's Bibliography [1970:xxi].) In a 1992 personal communication Hockett suggests a different example, comparing a passage critical of a predecessor in Bloomfield 1933 with his own pre-Weissian 1914a, 1914b, and 1916. '[A] great weakness of [Hermann] Paul's Principles [of linguistic history, 1880] is his insistence upon "psychological" interpretation. He accompanies his statements about language with a par- aphrase in terms of mental processes which the speakers are supposed to have undergone. The only evidence for these mental processes is the linguistic process; they add nothing to the dis- cussion, but only obscure it' (Bloomfield 1933:17). Bloomfield himself did just this in some of his earlier works. Consider his discussion in 1914b of 'the sound group iy, expressive of continuity of action'. To the 'linguistic processes' of absence of stress and limited distribution, Bloomfield adds his own 'paraphrase in terms of mental processes': 'Its associational value is clear, but apperceptive value it can never have: it never falls into the focus of the attention' (Hockett 1970:66). 14 Jespersen's Growth and structure of the English language is also exalted here: 'a panorama, without equal, of the history of a language' (103); regard for this work continues throughout Bloom- field's career. 473</page><page sequence="10">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) Jespersen as a source. On the other hand, two of the Postulates' Assumptions for historical linguistics 'try to embody the results of Jespersen's Progress in Language' (Hockett 1970:137, n. 8; the note in the original is n. 7): 'Sound- change preponderantly favors shorter forms' (137), and 'Analogic change pre- dominantly disfavors irregular glossemes and those which diverge from their fellows; it tends to disfavor them in inverse ratio to their frequency of occur- rence' (138). In both of these Postulates, the key issue is form. Note also that the anthropomorphism here contrasts markedly with Bloomfield's statements of the other postulated assumptions (none of which is attributed to Jespersen) and almost certainly was directly influenced by Jespersen's work. In 1927 Bloomfield again distinguishes himself from some aspects of Jes- persen's work while supporting others, in a review of The philosophy of gram- mar.15 'In the study of linguistic forms ... I should not appeal, as Jespersen sometimes does, to meaning as if it were separable from form, or to the actual human necessities and conveniences of communication' (Hockett 1970:142); these lie 'beyond the power of our science' (141). But Bloomfield does consider 'substitutive and syntactic features' as 'form', and he goes on to find Jespersen compatible in details of the analysis of English syntax, including Jespersen's fundamental concepts of 'nexus' and 'junction' (142). Even so, Bloomfield cautions that 'one should be careful not to universalize' these syntactic con- cepts (142), suggesting that 'an entirely different system ... will be derived' from a consideration of Algonquian (143). This is a fundamental disagreement, although Bloomfield does not overtly phrase it as such. Jespersen himself be- gins by describing the book as 'an attempt at a connected presentation of my views of the general principles of grammar' (1924:7) and ends by saying that his 'endeavour has been ... to give due prominence to the great principles underlying the grammars of all languages' (344). For Bloomfield, 'it is in the statement of fact, in the wealth and delicacy of observation, that one finds the merit of Jespersen's book' (143);16 it is not in Jespersen's theory, his general principles, of grammar.17 'On recent work in general linguistics' (1927a) contains Bloomfield's succinct yet comprehensive assessment of the contributions of various scholars of his day. Footnote 1 lists the 'few treatises which attempted to define the place of language in the universe' in the nineteenth century (Hockett 1970:173). Ar- ranged in chronological order are many of the references later to be offered in Bloomfield's Language, including both of Whitney's general books on language and Jespersen's Progress. Bloomfield begins the twentieth century with 15 Malkiel 1979 does not specify a particular Bloomfield review of Jespersen, but his remarks are as relevant to Bloomfield 1927b as they are to Bloomfield 1922b (see discussion above). 16 Roman Jakobson is one of the few scholars to have acknowledged Bloomfield's views of Jespersen. In Jakobson 1979, however, he quotes only the conclusion of this phrase, reporting that Bloomfield had said that through The philosophy of grammar 'English grammar will be forever enriched' (168). 17 It is ironic that Bloomfield appears to misunderstand the goals of precisely that book which Jespersen first sketched in an American lecture series (at Columbia University, 1909-10; Jespersen 1924:7). 474</page><page sequence="11">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD 'Wundt's great work' ( Volkerpsychologie, I. Die Sprache, Leipzig, 1900), say- ing that 'it is followed by lesser ones at more frequent intervals' (Hockett 1970:173). Among these 'lesser' works, chronologically listed in n. 2, we again find many of the sources that will appear in Language, including Jespersen's Language and The philosophy of grammar, as well as Bloomfield's own 1914a. With the appearance of 'On recent work ...' certain references are well es- tablished in Bloomfield's publications. Jespersen's Philosophy is again credited for 'marvelous detail and sensitiveness' (Hockett 1970:180), but not for the general principles that Jespersen himself had sought. Indeed, Bloomfield's praise is faint by today's standards, and once more he seems to reject implicitly or perhaps to misinterpret Jespersen's goals, concluding that, for grammatical categories, 'a list of typical locutions seems to be about the best we can do' and claiming that 'This is the object of Jespersen's Philosophy of Grammar' (180). Jespersen's Language is again cited negatively on the matter of sound change and sound symbolism (183), while an example of sound change taken from Language and from the Modern English grammar is dismantled as an 'attack upon the postulate of uniform change of phonemes' (185). Throughout 1927 and in the remaining years until 1933, Bloomfield published more than 40 items, many of them reviews and notices, native American stories, and the extensive Menomini texts (1928). His increasing concern with method and his antagonism toward 'animism' and 'teleology' in linguistics (Hockett 1970:228-29) are particularly apparent in several reviews (see Hockett 1970:197-98, 231-39, 240-51)18 and in 'Linguistics as a science', an address to the Modern Language Association in December 1929, published in Studies in Philology in 1930. Despite the criticisms in his reviews, however, Bloomfield continues to cite Jespersen in studies dealing with the history and structure of English (see, for example, Hockett 1970:252, 253, 254). 3.3. BLOOMFIELD'S LANGUAGE. In the Preface to Language Bloomfield states: 'I have tried everywhere to present the accepted views, not even avoid- ing well-used standard examples; on disputed matters I have tried to state the point at issue; and in both cases I have given references, in the Notes and Bibliography ...' (viii). Obviously, what the author considers accepted, stan- dard, and disputed is the accumulation of his prior study and research, and so, given his earlier attention to Jespersen, the reader can expect-and indeed find-that in Language Bloomfield cites Jespersen on a wide range of topics, including phonetics, English grammar, language change, and foreign-language teaching. Bloomfield takes Jespersen's work on these subjects as part of the views of the day. Bloomfield was highly conscious of the history of the study of language in Europe and the United States, particularly during the 19th and early 20th cen- turies. Even today, Language as a textbook is unusual in including a chapter devoted to the history of linguistics (Ch. 1, 'The study of language'); here 18 These include reviews of works by John Ries (Bloomfield 1931) and Eduard Hermann (Bloom- field 1932), two other 'victims' mentioned along with Jespersen by Malkiel (1979:112). 475</page><page sequence="12">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) Bloomfield acknowledges his predecessors and praises their achievements. Further evidence of his concern with the history of the development of lin- guistics is found in the chronological order of references in his Notes to Lan- guage, an order which reflects his belief in the cumulative nature of science. Bloomfield's extensive references to Jespersen's work serve to record his per- ceptions of the history of modern linguistics; he considered Jespersen to have played an important role in that history. Jespersen was an unusually productive scholar; his bibliography totals 487 publications (Juul &amp; Nielsen 1989:xiv). Among these were seven major works available in English at the time Bloomfield published Language (Jespersen 1894, 1904, 1909- , 1922, 1924, 1925b, and 1929). Although Bloomfield readily cited works in other languages, particularly in German and French, the fact that Jespersen was widely available in English also may have contributed to his extensive presence in Bloomfield's introductory linguistics textbook. 3.3.1. BIBLIOGRAPHY IN LANGUAGE. Eight of Jespersen's major works pub- lished prior to the release of Bloomfield's Language are listed in the Bibli- ography (533), not only six of those available in English but also the early Fonetik (1897-99), in Danish, and its later partial translation into German, Lehrbuch der Phonetik (1904; Bloomfield cites the second edition of 1913). Of the major works in English, only Jespersen 1925b is not mentioned by Bloom- field, but he does include a supplement to Maitre phonetique (Jespersen &amp; Pedersen 1926) and, listed by title, an 1894 Festskrift til V[ilhelm] Thomsen, published in Copenhagen, to which Jespersen had contributed. 3.3.2. INDEX TO LANGUAGE. The Index is only minimally informative on Jes- persen, to whom there are just two page references. On p. 43 Bloomfield gives comparative figures on 'the number of speakers of the principal European lan- guages, in millions, for the years 1600 and 1912', taken from Jespersen 1929. Page 86 provides a brief explanation and examples of Jespersen's 'Analphabetic Notation' (from Jespersen 1913), which Bloomfield describes as just one of 'many phonetic alphabets' and promptly dismisses as 'not intended for the recording of whole utterances'. For Bloomfield, these two Jespersen citations were probably no more than a convenient source of statistics in the first in- stance, and in the second just one example of an idiosyncratic transcription system.19 Thus, the Index would be a highly misleading historiographic source if taken alone, without considering the Bibliography and, especially, the Notes.20 3.3.3. NOTES TO LANGUAGE. Bloomfield cites Jespersen on all but two of the fourteen pages of his Notes. Thirty-two references are made to Jespersen's work in notes to sixteen of the twenty-eight chapters of Language. On none of these occasions does Bloomfield suggest that Jespersen's views are 'disputed 19 It follows a short paragraph on Bell's 'Visible Speech', which Bloomfield also rejects-because it 'is hard to write and very costly to print' (86). 20 Koerner 1989 also observes that in Bloomfield 1933 'the index does not cover the back matter' (440). 476</page><page sequence="13">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD matters'. In the absence of such contradiction, it is reasonable to conclude that in all of these notes Bloomfield considered Jespersen to present 'accepted views' and 'standard examples'. The scope of Bloomfield's references to Jespersen is particularly impressive. Jespersen is cited throughout Language: there are notes to the opening chapters on 'The use of language' (512) and 'Speech-communities' (513) (Chs. 2 and 3); throughout the synchronic, descriptive chapters on 'The phoneme' (514), 'Types of phonemes' (514), 'Meaning' (515), 'Grammatical forms' (516), 'Syn- tax' (516), 'Form-classes and lexicon' (517) (Chs. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, and 16, re- spectively); throughout the historical chapters on 'Written records' (518), 'Phonetic change' (520), 'Types of phonetic change' (520, 521), 'Analogic change' (521), 'Cultural borrowing' (522), 'Intimate borrowing' (522, 523), and 'Dialect borrowing' (523) (Chs. 17, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, and 28, respectively); and for Ch. 28, Bloomfield's concluding chapter on 'Applications and outlook' (524). Seven of Jespersen's books are cited in their entirety in the Notes:21 Fonetik 1897-99 (514), Lehrbuch der Phonetik 1913 (514), A modern English grammar on historical principles 1909- (516), The philosophy of grammar 1924 (516), Growth and structure of the English language 1929 (518), Progress in language 1894 (518, 524), and How to teach a foreign language 1904 (524). Language: Its nature, development, and origin (1922) fails to receive this implicit en- dorsement, being cited only in part-surely because it contains 'disputed mat- ter', as discussed by Bloomfield 1922b (see ?3.2 above).22 A further indicator of Jespersen's importance to Bloomfield is his frequent use of Jespersen's work as the sole reference on a topic. Beginning with the note to p. 29 in his second chapter (512), where Bloomfield discusses children's language acquisition, and ending on the final pages of the book, for which he cites in its entirety Jespersen's early Progress in language on the '[g]eneral tendency of linguistic development' (524), Jespersen is Bloomfield's sole ref- erence for some fifteen different topics. Many of these references are to Jes- persen's work on phonetics, both descriptive-'Glottal stops', 'Trills', the sounds of Danish (all notes on 514)-and historical-'Insertion of stops', 'Types of r in Europe' (both 521). Others, however, span a variety of topics: the concept of 'Ranks' in syntax (517); the 'Number of words used' by speakers of a language (517); 'Substratum theory' (521); 'Regular versus irregular com- binations' in the chapter on 'Analogic change' (521); lexical borrowings into English from Latin and French (522); and 'Jargons, trade languages, creolized languages' (523). In addition, there are notes in which Jespersen is just one of several refer- ences, but again there is a substantial range of topics: for example, 'Sex-dif- 21 Dates given here and in the References below are those cited by Bloomfield, except for Jes- persen's Language (see n. 22 below). 22 There are discrepancies in the dates: in Language Bloomfield cites a 'London and New York, 1923' printing (533); his review of this work (Bloomfield 1922b) is for 'New York: Henry Holt and Co., 1922' (Hockett 1970:102). The first printing was 1922, London: Allen &amp; Unwin; this is the date used here. 477</page><page sequence="14">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) ferences' (513); the text section (156-57) on 'intensity' as a 'specialized type of connotation' in word meaning (515); 'English aspects' (517); 'Against the [neogrammarian] hypothesis' (520); 'Back formation' (521); 'Obsolete words revived' (523); 'Foreign-language teaching' (524). Although he had rejected Jespersen's attribution of language change to 'de- sires' or 'needs' in his review of Jespersen's Language, Bloomfield retained his belief in Jespersen's thesis that 'historical change is progressive'. Jesper- sen's Progress in language is the final note in Bloomfield's Language.23 3.4. AFTER LANGUAGE. Following the publication of Language in 1933, Bloomfield continued his arguments against mentalism, animism, and teleology in linguistics. The attack was sustained in various articles almost to the end of his publications following a severe stroke in May 1946.24 Also revealing his interest in the relationship between linguistics and science was a 1935 article in the journal Philosophy of science which served as the basis for his 1939 monograph of the same title, Linguistic aspects of science. Since it is an en- cyclopedia entry, there are no footnotes within the text, but the 'Selected bib- liography' includes Jespersen's The philosophy of grammar for information on 'levels and ranks of construction', discussed in a section on syntax. Some of Bloomfield's linguistic work during the 1930s was devoted to his studies of Algonquian languages (e.g. Bloomfield 1939b, 1946, and the post- humously published Bloomfield 1958, 1962), but beginning in 1940 there is an emphasis on the applications of linguistics to reading (e.g. Bloomfield 1942a) and to foreign-language teaching. The latter was a lifelong interest (see Bloom- field 1912b) but achieved greater attention at this time as a consequence of World War II and the involvement of the Linguistic Society of America in the effort by the American Council of Learned Societies to prepare texts for foreign languages important to the United States military effort. In addition to writing texts for Dutch and Russian (Bloomfield 1944a, 1944c, 1945b, 1945c),25 Bloom- field addressed foreign-language learners (Bloomfield 1942b), teachers of Ger- man (1943a), and the broader reading audience of The Yale review in 'About foreign language teaching' (1945a). The Yale review article points to Jespersen's How to teach a foreign language as a work that teachers of foreign languages should, but often did not, read (Hockett 1970:428). This is Bloomfield's final 23 The section number given in the final note of my April 1962 printing is 26.6. This is a misprint; Ch. 26 is on 'Intimate borrowing' and ends with section 26.5. This '26.6' is the last note to Ch. 28 and to the book as a whole, but it is not in numerical order; the preceding note is to section 28.5. A comparison to the text indicates that the note should be to section 28.7, the concluding section of the book. 24 For example, in a 1943 review Bloomfield rejects the 'traditional philosophic jargon' in Swa- desh's introduction to linguistics, La nuevafilologia, particularly phrases such as 'las posibilidades de conceptualizacion de la mente humana' (Hockett 1970:407). And in 1944 he continues the theme in 'Secondary and tertiary responses to language', where he notes that 'animistic and teleological terminology ... does no good and much harm in linguistics, or, for that matter, in any branch of science' (Hockett 1970:420). 25 See Hall (1990:71-77, 83) for an account of Bloomfield's work on these texts; also Joos (1986:97-126). 478</page><page sequence="15">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD reference to Jespersen, and it is to the same work that he had cited more than thirty years earlier in one of his first publications (see ?3.1 above). 3.5. CONCLUSIONS. Otto Jespersen is cited throughout Leonard Bloom- field's publications, from one of his earliest reviews to one of his last articles. In Bloomfield's Language Jespersen is the chief single European source for references on synchronic and descriptive linguistics; at the same time, Jes- persen is also a major resource on historical topics. Indeed, in Language the citations of Jespersen stand out clearly and distinctly from those of any other European scholar, living or deceased at the time.26 Particularly for information on the structure and history of English, Bloomfield provides an unabated series of references to Jespersen. The reason is surely related to an assessment offered by Randolph Quirk; Jespersen, he wrote, is 'the most distinguished scholar of the English language who has ever lived' (Quirk 1982:[vi]). While Bloomfield publicly rejected certain 'mentalistic' aspects of Jesper- sen's work, including those that were strikingly similar to his own earlier dis- sertation on sound symbolism, he continued to support, and even to promote, Jespersen's views on 'progress' in language change-a position that some mod- ern scholars might find mentalistic as well. Also consistent were Bloomfield's references to Jespersen's work on foreign-language teaching, a matter which engaged Bloomfield's interest through much of his career, from his early days as a teacher of German through his last years as a contributor to the ACLS language materials.27 Bloomfield's criticisms of Jespersen's work were concentrated in the period 1922-1927, when he frequently focused on issues of science and method. He made similar criticisms of others during this period, sometimes specifically- 'Like the rest of us, Dr. [Edward] Sapir still pays tribute to aprioristic specu- lation which steals upon us in the guise of psychology' (1922a/Hockett 1970:93)-more often in general:'every now and then, before some knotty prob- lem, a linguist will lay down the long-tried tools of his trade, not to sharpen or improve them, but to resort instead, for the nonce, to incantations about whose value no two even of the psychologic shamans will agree' (1927a/Hockett 1970:176-77). As the opening phrase in the passage about Sapir indicates, Bloomfield did not excuse himself from such criticism. He includes his own 26 Recently, much more attention has been paid to Bloomfield's references to Ferdinand de Saussure; see, for example, Andresen 1990 (especially pp. 236-40), Joseph 1989, and Koerner 1989. It may be noted that, in contrast to his references to Jespersen, Bloomfield cites Saussure in only six notes in Language (512, 514, 516, 517, 521), and that for the entire thirteen-year period from 1933 until the end of Bloomfield's publications, he apparently made no further published references to Saussure. 27 Andresen, discussing Bloomfield's review of Saussure (Bloomfield 1924), comments on Bloom- field's 'jab at Europeans' lack of field work ... intertwined, in this review, with Bloomfield's commitment to the linguist as teacher of foreign languages, which is distinguished from the Eu- ropean linguists' corresponding lack of commitment to the teaching of foreign languages' (1990:238). In contrast to these unnamed European linguists, however, Jespersen retained a lifelong commit- ment to foreign-language teaching, particularly English (S0rensen 1989), and this clearly appealed to Bloomfield. 479</page><page sequence="16">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) 1914a among the 'lesser' works in 1927a (Hockett 1970:174, n. 2), and in 1933 he acknowledges its problems 'based ... on the psychologic system of Wilhelm Wundt, which was then [but by 1933 was no longer] widely accepted' (vii); see also ?3.2 and n. 13 above. But in none of these cases, including those involving Jespersen, did Bloomfield allow his criticisms to overshadow his appreciation and acknowledgment of the contributions of his predecessors and his contem- poraries. Despite disagreement on some points, Bloomfield consistently recognized and valued Jespersen's place in the development of linguistics. From one of his earliest publications (1911), his first general book (1914a), and a mid-1920s overview (1927a) to his major textbook (1933) and beyond (e.g. 1939a), in the body of his texts and in his usually chronologically-ordered notes, Bloomfield cited Jespersen and his work. The 'stubbornly nativist tradition' and 'the Ameri- can spokesmen's refusal to follow European leaders' which Malkiel suggests find their 'clearest expression' in Bloomfield's 'book reviews and position pa- pers' (1979:112) do not characterize Bloomfield's relationship to Jespersen. And while Andresen argues that in 'Bloomfield's programmatic writings of the 1920s, he consistently valorizes a distinctly American version of linguistics' (1990:208), the evidence from his lifetime of publication also supports the view that Bloomfield valued and acknowledged many contributions to linguistics by the Danish scholar Jespersen.28 4. JESPERSEN IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER BLOOMFIELD. In his Introduction to the celebratory essays marking the 50th anniversary (in 1974) of the Lin- guistic Society of America, Einar Haugen observed that 'During the first quarter century of the LSA [1924-1949], there was a strong drift away from the European moorings', and noted that 'contemporary leaders claim to be renewing ideas overlooked by an intervening generation'; those whose ideas were being renewed were 'Descartes, the School of Port-Royal, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Otto Jespersen' (1979:2). One of the contemporary leaders was D. Terence Langendoen, who, in the same volume as Haugen, comments on 'the importance of Edward Sapir, Otto Jespersen, and others that contemporary linguists single out as their pre-Chomskyan intellectual forbears' (1979:145). 4.1. POST-BLOOMFIELDIAN STRUCTURALISM. As discussed above, Bloomfield himself was not responsible for any drift away from Jespersen, but such a drift did indeed occur toward the end of the period of which Haugen writes. There 28 Of course, other linguists in America also read Jespersen during the 1920s and 1930s. In the very first address at the founding meeting of the LSA, on December 28, 1924, Hermann Collitz (1855-1935), first president of the Society, cited Jespersen 1922, along with Bloomfield 1914a, as recent works that attempted 'to survey the whole field [of linguistics] in the brief compass of one or two volumes' (Lg. 1.15, 1925). Kemp Malone (1889-1971) listed Jespersen's Growth and struc- ture of the English language as the textbook for his course History of the English Language at the first LSA Linguistic Institute in Summer 1928 (Joos 1986:22). Contacts with Jespersen's work during these decades were important enough for some linguists to warrant written recollection more than a half century later; see Robert A. Hall, Jr. (1991:172), Einar Haugen (1980:135), Fred W. Householder (1980:194), Stanley S. Newman (1991:211), and Eugene A. Nida (1991:229). 480</page><page sequence="17">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD are few references to Jespersen in American linguistic writings of the post- Bloomfieldian American structuralist period. Even Haugen himself did not mention Jespersen in his 1950 LSA Presidential address, where he challenged the 'provincialism' of American linguistics and its 'disinterest' in European writers (Haugen 1951).29 Perhaps most revealing is the place of Jespersen in two of the major American textbooks/surveys from this time: H. A. Gleason, Jr., 1961 and Charles F. Hockett 1958.30 Gleason does not mention Jespersen in his text, cites no ex- amples from Jespersen's works (see p. 491), and lists only Jespersen's Lan- guage and Essentials in his 'Selected bibliography' (482). These two works are accorded minimal respect in the remarks that follow the list of books: 'Jes- persen's Language is another older manual, now largely obsolete, although for a few subjects it has not yet been superseded' (485); Essentials of English grammar is one of two 'best one-volume works' among 'the older traditional grammars [that] are often very useful for details, though generally unsatisfac- tory for general framework' (490). In Hockett 1958 Jespersen appears only in the end notes to two chapters (out of 64) and in the Bibliography. For Chapter 26, 'Parts of Speech', Jespersen 1909-49 and 1933a head a list of five 'standard full-length discussions of English' that 'do not break with the Latinizing tra- dition by which English has nouns, verbs, and adjectives as separate parts of speech' (229). For Chapter 38, 'Idiolect, Dialect, Language', there is 'On id- iolects, dialects, languages, see Jespersen 1925[b]' (329). These three refer- ences appear in the Bibliography (602). The comparisons with Bloomfield's treatment of Jespersen in his 1933 Language (?3.3 above) are both obvious and striking: recall that Bloomfield cites eight books by Jespersen, on an extensive range of topics, in 16 of his 28 chapters. Even for the more specialized topic of the structure of English, for which Bloomfield had frequently cited and praised Jespersen, Jespersen's work holds a marginal position among those who followed Bloomfield. Already in a 1943 University of Michigan doctoral dissertation, Eugene Nida, while recognizing Jespersen as 'really the first to approach the problems of the larger patterns [of English grammar] in a serious way' in Jespersen 1937, finds 'difficulty in his approach' in Vol. II (1928) of Jespersen 1909-49 because of 'the manner of classification which is based on a semantic rather than a formal relationship between constituents' (Nida 1960:13). Nida criticizes Jespersen's 'making of an attributive barking in the barking dog of the same rank as barks in the dog barks' because this analysis 'does not account for the difference in endocentric and exocentric constructions which Bloomfield so adequately demonstrates [he 29 He did mention the Europeans Saussure and Trubetzkoy, along with Louis Hjelmslev, whose work he discusses in some detail. 30 Issues relevant to the selection of Gleason and Hockett in the discussion that follows can be found in Hymes &amp; Fought (1981:128-31). While Francis' name does not appear in Hymes &amp; Fought, and although they discuss the appropriateness of identifying Fries as, intellectually, a post-Bloom- fieldian (128-29), both Francis 1958 and Fries 1952 provide extensive studies (and bibliographies) on the structure of English; the virtual omission of Jespersen from these works is significant. 481</page><page sequence="18">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) cites Bloomfield 1933:163ff.]' (14). A similar problem-Jespersen's 'rather se- rious distortion and complication of the formal and functional values'-is cited for his 'largely unwarranted' treatment of 'the doctor's arrival' as 'equivalent in meaning to a "nexus" construction, the doctor arrives' (28). (See ?4.3 below for later references to these examples.) Nida was troubled by Jespersen's use of meaning; as Nida understood it, 'the notional approach' was 'the adoption of meaning as the basis for gram- matical classification' (26). He also identified problems with Jespersen's 'failure to emphasize the phonemic interpretation' in dealing with intonation (17), and rightly criticized (33) a proposal that a tongue-trilled r 'requires a good deal of energy, the sound is loud and noisy, and was therefore fit for the open-air life of olden times' (Jespersen 1933a:39). Jespersen and other grammarians 'seem to believe that a descriptive grammar should be explanatory and interpretive', with the result that 'this attempt to answer the why's of syntax ... has given rise to so many useless and erroneous speculations' (30). Finally, Nida is disturbed that 'Often there is a tendency to explain some particular linguistic item by broad generalizations' (34). Here he cites an ex- ample from 'Otto Jespersen, A Modern English Grammar, Vol. III, p. 288' (34, n. 82): '... there is in all languages a tendency to place a weakly stressed pronoun as near to the verb as possible' (34). Nida concludes that 'more fundamental than a misstatement is the implication that with the present meagre knowledge which is possessed concerning "all languages" one is able to lay down such generalized principles' (34). Despite these difficulties, Nida recognized that Jespersen's work was 'of major importance' (37), but several other prominent American structural lin- guists of the 1950s provided less recognition and acknowledgment. W. Nelson Francis has recently referred to Jespersen as 'a great grammarian, whose theory and practice can still be stimulating to a modern student of English grammar' (1989:99), but in his own text, The structure of American English (1958), Francis made neither mention of Jespersen nor reference to any of his works. Charles Carpenter Fries, in The structure of English (1952), referred to Jespersen only in three footnotes (3, n. 1; 7, n. 5; 20, n. 17), once in passing in the text (17), and as the source of a definition of the sentence, a definition Fries does not adopt (20). The works cited by Fries are Jespersen 1937, vol. 4 of 1909-49, and 1924. Francis 1989 offers several criticisms of Jespersen's scholarship that may partially account for the shift away from his work and influence during the post-Bloomfield years: Jespersen's 'focus is obviously on European culture languages' (81), the notations of Jespersen's syntactic analyses are 'quite com- plicated' (82), and there are some 'serious defects' in Analytic syntax, including 'failure to identify the word-classes to which grammatical elements belong' (91) and 'the omission of many features which other grammars see fit to include'- such as 'number, person, tense, and gender', as well as 'aspect and mode' (92). These criticisms come long after Jespersen's disappearance from and reap- pearance in (see ?4.3 below) American linguistics; even more telling are com- ments made at the time. 482</page><page sequence="19">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD In a footnote (1952:3, n. 1), Fries recognizes Jespersen's Analytic syntax as one of very few opponents of conventional grammar that offer 'suggestions as to how an understanding of the mechanism of our language must be gained' (3), yet he does not mention the work again in his book on the structure of English. Instead he presents his own efforts 'not only to challenge anew the conventional use of "meaning" as the basic tool of analysis in ... sentence structure and syntax-but also to illustrate the use of procedures that assume that all the signals of structure are formal matters that can be described in physical terms' (7-8). Jespersen is one of those whose 'conventional use' of meaning is challenged:'Otto Jespersen insists, for example, "But in syntax meaning is everything." A Modern English Grammar (Heidelberg, 1931), IV, 291' (7, n. 5). Fries' focus on procedures for 'finding the precise formal signals that operate to convey ... meaning' rests on a citation to Bloomfield's Language (8, n. 6), recalling (?3.2 above) both Bloomfield's attack on Jespersen's Phi- losophy of grammar for its 'appeal ... to meaning as if it were separable from form' (Hockett 1970:142) and his concern that Jespersen's Language does not follow 'the method of science' (Hockett 1970:102).31' Indeed, it was Jespersen's perceived failure to follow certain methodological principles that Samuel R. Levin, writing in the late 1960s in the 'Foreword' to a reprinting of Analytic syntax, suggests made him most 'vulnerable to criti- cism': 'it was primarily because his approach to linguistic analysis did not conform with a theoretical outlook that placed an excessive premium on ob- jectively verifiable linguistic statement' (1969:v). More recently, McCawley proposes that 'the AS [Analytic syntax] conceptual scheme was so far in ad- vance of the understanding of most syntacticians of the 1930s that few of them could profit enough from the originality of Jespersen's insights to justify the investment of time and effort needed to learn his somewhat perverse notational system' (1991:119). Beyond the difficulties of Jespersen's notational system and such conflicts regarding procedures and the place of meaning in linguistic analysis, much of Jespersen's work was simply not relevant to the chief concerns of American structuralists in the 1940s and 1950s. Noted above (?3.2) was his effort in Phi- losophy of grammar to establish 'the general principles of grammar', 'the great principles underlying the grammars of all languages' (1924:7, 344)-an effort specifically rejected by Bloomfield and of little interest to some American struc- tural linguists who followed him. Jespersen's focus on phonetics (Rischel 1989) came at a time when many Americans were more centered on phonology. His 31 Jespersen had once held a more prominent place in Fries' work. Harold B. Allen recollects that '... in the summers of 1937, 1938, and 1939 I served Fries as his assistant in his course, English grammar for English teachers. Initially, this course focused upon Jespersen, Kruisinga, Sweet, Poutsma, and Curme ..., but it soon came to reflect also the heady atmosphere of the Linguistic Institute which Fries had been able to bring to Ann Arbor for five summers beginning in 1936' (Allen 1980:114-115). My own recollection and notes from a course on the structure of English offered by Fries in the early 1960s at Georgetown University are that-by that time-there was no mention of Jespersen (or any of the other scholars Allen identifies); all work cited came from American structural linguists. 483</page><page sequence="20">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) great body of historical work held little interest for those who were concen- trating on synchronic description, and his lifelong belief in the progressive nature of language change was disregarded. His interest in an international auxiliary language (Larsen 1989) had been shared by Edward Sapir, but not by any major American linguist in these decades. His concern for child language (Vejleskov 1989) predated the interest of mainstream American linguistics by more than a quarter century, and, further, several of his books and articles on the subject were available only in Danish (see Vejleskov 142-43, n. 1). Aside from English, the languages which most interested Jespersen-Danish and other modern and older Germanic languages; French, other modern Ro- mance languages, and Latin; and Greek-were not those that attracted the attention of many American scholars at the time. As Francis notes, 'The vast fields of African, Amerindian, Oceanic, Oriental, and Australian languages were unknown to him; in fact, a great deal of the research and study in these areas has taken place since he wrote' (1989:81). Yet this is almost exactly the range of languages used in Gleason 1961 (see the list of sources for his examples, p. 491), and Hockett 1958 includes Chinese and Menominee among the six languages from which he 'draws most heavily' for examples when English does not suffice (11). And for American linguists (including Hockett and Gleason) who did cite from the European languages, there were sources far closer to home than the works of a Danish scholar. With all of these reasons, and undoubtedly others as well, it is clear that the change in Jespersen's status in American linguistic circles-from major figure and sometime chief source for Leonard Bloomfield in the 1920s, 1930s, and early 1940s to virtual nonentity by the mid 1950s-was occasioned more by changes in topics of scholarly interest than by critical failings in the quality of Jespersen's scholarship.32 Of course there were Jespersen's excesses of ex- planation (as with the trilled r mentioned above), but it is only in his lifelong position on 'progress' in language change (Jespersen 1941; see especially ?13.1, p. 85), a contribution valued by Bloomfield, that a major aspect of Jespersen's work has been largely superseded today (see, for example, Aitchison 1985). 4.2. HISTORIOGRAPHY. It is somewhat more difficult to account for Jesper- sen's absence from historiographic works that treat the Bloomfield era and the post-Bloomfield decade of American structural linguistics. Historiography for this period is relatively new and the lack of attention to Jespersen could be mere oversight. But even oversight requires explanation. Some historians could have overreacted to Bloomfield's negative assess- ments of aspects of Jespersen's work, failing to attend to the high regard in which Bloomfield held Jespersen on other subjects and occasions, as well as the extent to which he cited Jespersen's works. It is also possible that some linguists engaged in historical writing themselves held dismissive views about Jespersen's work similar to those expressed in Fries 1952 or Nida 1960. Also relevant may be the fact that some writers organize 20th-century linguistics in terms of trends and schools; Jespersen resists such classification and is largely 32 See Hymes &amp; Fought (1981:22) on the matter of 'centrality of topics of scholarly interest for the history of linguistics. 484</page><page sequence="21">OTTO JESPERSEN AND LEONARD BLOOMFIELD absent from such accounts even when they provide considerable attention to other European scholars (e.g. Ivic 1965, Sampson 1980). And then there is the fact that modern historians recognize: there is rarely a single authoritative history of any time, place, or academic discipline.33 Dif- ferent histories, not necessarily incompatible, may simply offer a different se- lection of facts, represent different perspectives, or attempt to explain different phenomena. In any case, at this point it is clear that, at the least, scholarly standards and justice to an underrepresented predecessor require acknowl- edgment of Otto Jespersen's place in linguistics in the United States during the first half of the 20th century.34 4.3. GENERATIVE-TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR. In the past third century, beginning with the syntactic focus of generative-transformational grammar, Otto Jespersen's place in American linguistics has received renewed attention, centered largely, but not solely, on his work in syntax. Early citations referred approvingly to accounts of English structure drawn primarily from Jespersen 1909-49, e.g. Lees (1957:387-88, n. 19) and Chomsky (1962:124, n. 2); the latter specifically challenged Nida's criticisms of Jesper- sen's observations regarding the barking dog and the doctor's arrival, men- tioned in ?4.1 above. A 1971 paper by Audrey Reynolds presented some 'similarities between [Jespersen's] views and the views of post-Syntactic Struc- tures linguists' (519), giving particular consideration to Jespersen 1924, 1925b, and 1937. For the July 1974 LSA Golden Anniversary Symposium, Chomsky provided a lengthy discussion of several fundamental concepts from Jespersen's The philosophy of grammar, including notional categories and 'the program that Jespersen outlined for linguistic theory in 1924' (1975:81). Jespersen had de- fined notional categories as 'extralingual categories which are independent of the more or less accidental facts of existing languages; they are universal in so far as they are applicable to all languages, though rarely expressed in them in a clear and unmistakable way' (1924:55). For Jespersen it was 'the gram- marian's task in each case to investigate the relation between the notional and the syntactic categories' (1924:55). Chomsky observes that this program 'found little resonance during roughly the first half of the history of the Linguistic Society of America' (1975:81), but concludes that 'the work of recent years tends generally to support the basic ideas that Jespersen outlined 50 years ago, and extends and advances the program that he outlined. The relation between notional and syntactic categories is, by now, a major topic of investigation in the study of language' (109).35 33 Aarsleff recognizes this for 20th-century American linguistics, although he views the case he is describing as one in which a 'variety of incompatible histories is good evidence that something is wrong' (1979:93). 34 See Hymes &amp; Fought (1981:4) for such grounds as a factor in historiography. 35 Chomsky 1975 also discusses Jespersen's concept of 'free expressions' (see 1924:18-24), par- ticularly Jespersen's view that a child 'from innumerable sentences heard and understood ... will abstract some notion of their structure which is definite enough to guide him in framing sentences of his own' (1924:19); these issues also appear in Chomsky 1986, especially on pp. 21-24. 485</page><page sequence="22">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 3 (1992) This renewed interest in Jespersen's work has resulted in two reprintings of his 1937 book Analytic syntax, the first in 1969 with 'Foreword' by Levin, the second in 1984 with 'Introduction' by James D. McCawley. McCawley 1970, 1984, and 1991 discuss Jespersen's contributions to syntactic theory and to the analysis of English syntax, as well as reasons for this renewed interest. Both McCawley (1991:118, n. 2) and Francis (1989:92) mention contemporary Re- lational Grammar as resembling aspects of Jespersen's most mature work on syntax. In other areas of scholarship, note, as only a few of many possible examples, that Jespersen is cited by seven contemporary linguists writing on different topics in Newmeyer 1988 (I: 129, 202, 306, 373; 11: 117, 240; 111:38, n. 1). Con- sider, from another perspective, Lois Bloom's Language development from two to three, with twelve references to Jespersen (1991:5, 146, 160, 291, 293, 305, 306, 308, 322-23, 330, 373, n. 6, and 400). Only the reference on p. 400 cites Jespersen on child language acquisition;36 Bloom's other references are to Jespersen's descriptive and historical work on English, the work so valued by Bloomfield. 4.4. CONCLUSION. Scholars continue to find useful insights and relevant ex- amples in Jespersen's prolific writings. The 'great principles underlying the grammars of all languages' and the 'little things' that intrigued Jespersen still fascinate modern linguists. But reading Jespersen reveals yet another expla- nation for the survival of his works, a more elusive attribute captured so well in the Foreword to a recent American reprinting of a classic Jespersen book (Quirk 1982:[vi]):'Jespersen's continuing appeal lies in the sheer scholarly qual- ity of the man: our awareness in reading him that we are engaged with a su- premely learned and cultivated mind.'
