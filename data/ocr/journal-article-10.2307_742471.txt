<plain_text><page sequence="1">Instruments of Desire: Musical Morphology in the Early Work of Picasso Simon Miller Given the prevalence of musical subjects in the work of Picasso, sur- prisingly little research into the phenomenon has been done to date. My intention in this paper, through consideration of a number of key Cubist images, is to propose a reading that will connect Picasso's use of musical subject matter with earlier Western artistic traditions and to point to its importance for his post-Cubist work. 1 With few exceptions, only two classes of musical instruments are found in the Cubist canvasses of Picasso and the other Cubists: wood- wind and strings--specifically tenora (not, incidentally, the clarinet) and mandolin, guitar and violin.2 But before considering the use of such instruments in Cubist works, we must first consider briefly their role in the wider historical context of Western painting, and to do so, we must map out the "ideal" distinctions as classically established and handed down from ancient times. The categories of "high" and "low" culture are acknowledgment, more or less tacit, of these antique terms. The ideal and its sometime twin, the mythic, come before the historic and its somewhat dissolute companion, the real. History, while being by no means disconnected from myth, has the charms of unpredictability and suggestiveness in being something other than mere exemplification. In history, boundaries are not so rigid; they can be denied, subverted, transgressed, ridiculed. While notions of high and low continue to operate, instruments and musical activities have a more fluid relationship to them in real historical circumstances. As a result, the visual representation of musical acts should be thought of as part of a dialogue--implicit rather than voiced-with the oppositions set up anciently. For, actually, history is more equivocal than myth. Guitar (1912-13). Sheet metal and wire, 301/2" x 131/8" X 75/8". Collection, The Museum of Modem Art, New York. Gift of the artist. 443</page><page sequence="2">4aij tq</page><page sequence="3">444 The Musical Quarterly What is apposite here about the study of Picasso's Cubist works in connection with musical content is that, perhaps symptomatic of his art in general and consistent with the essentials of his particular Cubist methods, the musical instruments in his pictures signal his relish of the real ambiguity of such cultural distinctions. The two classes of instrument--woodwind and strings--typically characterize opposite sides of a dualistic system in Western modes of representation. In classical times, it was manifested by Apollo and Marsyas.3 Apollo, whose music is made of the exact mathematical ratio of string lengths, vanquished in competition the mortal piper, Marsyas, whose music is made of, and exists in, the material element, air. In Christian theology, the oppositions of sacred and profane, or religious and pagan, tended to distribute strings and woodwind to heaven and earth, respectively. Nietzsche saw such oppositions in Apollonian and Dionysian terms. Today, the distinction between high and low culture, between art and folk culture, continues this division. Contrasting pairs of instruments were, in classical times, the aulos and kithara, and in the Middle Ages, the bagpipe and the lute. To give more recent oppositions is far more problematic given the proliferation of contemporary musical styles and genres. For example, the growth in access to orchestral music has tended to obscure social distinctions that have attached themselves traditionally to the classes of instru- ments. Therefore, it is difficult to isolate specific instruments, although the broader categories of high and low, folk and art still pertain in various ideological nooks and crannies. It is to these that the work of Picasso makes reference. Music has been featured in Western painting in many different contexts. Within medieval religious paintings, the most familiar sub- jects in which it is featured are those illustrating the Scriptures (including apocalyptical themes), the Rex Psalmista, and the 150th Psalm. For example, the Elders of Revelation are often shown holding vielles (a plucked string instrument) and harps (as mentioned in Rev. 14:2-3).4 In the Renaissance, the figure of King David is retained from medieval sources playing psaltery, harp, or, by the end of the fifteenth century, more often the lira da braccio, an instrument associ- ated with the revival of classical musical practice. It appears frequently as the attribute of the great poets and musicians of classical mythol- ogy. In the many depictions of Apollo's contest with Marsyas and Pan, the lira da braccio signifies noble "mathematical" music as opposed to the lascivious, passionate, and sensual music of the various reed instruments played by his only half-human opponents. As Eman- uel Winternitz has written of this myth, it represents</page><page sequence="4">Picasso's Musical Morphology 445 a poetic condensation of the eternal conflict, the antagonism between two musical realms, between strings and wind instruments. . . . It means in the rationalized form of the Greek myths the realm of inhibi- tion, of reason, of measure- in the literal Pythagorean sense of measur- ing strings and intervals, and in the metaphorical sense of "mesure"-as opposed to the realm of blind passion: in short, the antagonism between Apollo and Dionysus.5 By extension, the values thus represented function ideologically to patrol the borders between the realms of high and low cultural expres- sion. Following Pallas Athena, the deformation of the face through blowing was considered unacceptable to those with high social aspira- tions. This distinction is also reflected in the phallic symbolism of wind instruments in Renaissance paintings of lovers.6 By the sixteenth century, wind instruments were becoming more acceptable to those in the upper segments of society, although they were still largely played by traveling and professional--and therefore, not disinterested-musicians. It was a considerable time before wind instruments were deemed socially acceptable, the gentler sounding flutes and recorders being the first to achieve such a status. In seven- teenth- and eighteenth-century France, for example, the aristocratic fashion for the pastoral idyll can be seen as perhaps the main force behind the development of the musette, a relative of the bagpipe, but with a reduction in the size of its more awkward and heavy parts. The musette replaced the blowpipe of the bagpipe (unbecoming in the mouth of a lady) with bellows. Eighteenth-century attempts to foster an antimetropolitan and anti-absolutist sensibility and to dis- cover the beauty of a humble life of rustic labor, therefore, had reason to favor the pipe and flute. Frederick the Great's accomplishment on the instrument was more than a mere accident of his early musical education. Having briefly considered the general historical distinctions and symbolic function of the two groups of musical instruments, we shall now survey in a little more detail the historical context of the two most specific instruments found in Picasso's Cubist works: the violin and guitar. The violin was not an invention (unlike the pianoforte), but an instrument that evolved out of a long and variegated process of development. It was not until the later part of the sixteenth century that a standardized form of the instrument emerged in Cremona. This paper is not the place to consider in detail the question of its evolu- tion, but it should be noted that one strand of the violin's generic</page><page sequence="5">446 The Musical Quarterly background can be found in the lira da braccio, mentioned above in connection with high culture. However, the instrument we now rec- ognize as the violin is most often depicted in images of the century following its standardization as the partner of strolling musicians, that is, members of the lower classes. Not until the last third of the seventeenth century was it accepted as an instrument of the civilized classes, thus demonstrating the change in attitudes concerning the social distinctions of classes of instruments. As David Boyden has written in his history of violin playing: The violin, in short, was barely respectable from a social point of view, and compared to the lute, viol, or organ (the instrument of the church), it had practically no musical or social prestige at all. It was regarded as the common instrument of dance music with all the attendant disparaging associations, and it was played largely by profes- sionals who earned "their living by it" and who were regarded socially as servants.7 However, by the eighteenth century the violin was regarded as the archetypal instrument of the best music from "the European courts to the opera theatres."8 In this way, it operates across the borders of the high/low cultural divide, but in a complicated way.9 The other principal instrument in Cubist works is the guitar. We must first consider briefly the symbolism of one of its antecedents, the lute. The lute played a central role in European musical life for several centuries. (Already popular in the Middle Ages, its demise began with the rise in popularity of the polyphonic keyboard instruments around the seventeenth century.) Its privileged place among musical instru- ments was due to its portability and, therefore, its ability to take part in al fresco concerts/fetes champetres. 10 It also lent itself to more spontaneous music making, and it was appreciated for its rich tone (suited for accompanying the voice) and its ability to play a number of musical lines at once (polyphony). Polyphonic compositions could, therefore, be performed, in which the top line was sung and the oth- ers played on the lute. This ability of the instrument led to its appear- ance in numerous trionfi d'amore (Baroque paintings of music lessons).11 In short, the lute was often regarded as an aid in "winning the favours of ladies." Combining the seductive power of the voice (defined as a wind instrument) and the Olympian purity of measured strings, the music of the Lutenist could entertain while thoroughly expressing ambiguous protestations of love. So clear was its mean- ing, as an attribute of lovers, that it soon announced itself publicly.</page><page sequence="6">Picasso's Musical Morphology 447 For example, prostitutes in sixteenth-century England would often carry simple lutes with them into taverns as a mark of their trade. In the emblematic literature of the period, the structural make- up of the instrument was also equated with the physiology of a preg- nant woman-through the bulge of the lute's back and its resemblance to the womb. As Richard Leppert has shown, in Dutch paintings of the seventeenth century, the familiar subject of the procuress shows her accompanied by a musical instrument that is normally a lute.12 The music of the lute was largely taken over by the guitar with the demise of the former in the eighteenth century.13 In its early form, the guitar was a combination of European and Moorish tradi- tions. The ease of tuning and performance (compared to the lute) led to its great popularity not only as a concert instrument, but also, like the violin, as a folk instrument. This was particularly the case in Spain where the vibuela-a guitar-shaped instrument with many strings, associated with the aristocracy-declined in favor to be replaced by the folk instrument with added strings. (The folk guitar had originally four strings, which later became six.) In terms of its symbolism as a popular instrument for the accom- paniment of singing, dancing, and wooing, the guitar can be seen as taking over the role, and music, of the lute. And like the violin, it can be used for music of both high and low cultures, particularly in Spain. 14 But in terms of its shape, it obviously does not carry the same connotation as the womb-like lute, although the mandolin does. Nevertheless, like the violin, through its figure-eight shape it may be associated with the female torso. In this way, it maintains a physiolog- ical symbolism. II As mentioned, musical subjects form a major part of Picasso's Cubist output-for example, nearly half of all his works between 1912-14- but music and musicians are relatively rare in his earlier Blue and Rose periods. Music is seldom far away in such "minor key" works, but even though musical themes are not common, they are never merely neutral subjects when they do appear; they complement the major themes of this early period. Broadly speaking, his early works fall into two groups. One group represents the artist (musician)/beggar doomed to an existence on the fringes of society, as in, for example, the iconic The Old Guitarist (1903) and the Hurdy-Gurdy Man (1905). At the Lapin Agile (1905) shows Picasso as Harlequin and Germaine as Columbine, the</page><page sequence="7">448 The Musical Quarterly M!, Figure 1. The Old Guitarist (1903).

A sense of alienation here is made more acute by the background figure playing the guitar (Fride, the owner of the Lapin Agile); a community milieu of bohemian gaiety is here rendered lonely and melancholic. The Vio- linist (1905) depicts the musician as a more direct consoler, this time at the bedside of a dying woman, and calls to mind the inscription on the harpsichord in Vermeer's painting A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman Listening c. 1668-70: "Musica Letitiae Comes Medicina Doloris." The other group of works shows peasants/country folk at leisure; here (the opposite of At the Lapin Agile), music signifies the simplicity of a harmonious communal existence as in his Horta paint- ings of 1903. There, Catalan peasants listen to a guitarist or dance the jota, as in, for example, Guitarist Playing (1903) and Practising the Jota (1903). In short, the guitar and the evocation of music signify two con- trasting themes: the solitary bohemian existence of the artist, and the struggle for artistic life contrasts with the spirit of the shared experi- ences of community life. Art/high cultural expression and folk/low cultural expression are distributed in these themes in dialectically suggestive ways. Guitar, Sheet-Music and Wine Glass of November 1912 was his first or second experiment with the techniques of papier colle. It con- sists of a background of brown and white patterned wallpaper, over which a fragment of newspaper is stuck in the bottom left corner. Toward the lower right is a drawing of a glass on a separate white sheet of paper. A black semicircle of paper is stuck over parts of both the newspaper and the drawing of the glass. It forms the bottom sec- tion of the guitar. The left side of the guitar is composed of a sheet of painted imitation wood-grained paper, the main body of the instru- ment is defined by a space. The finger board is a sheet of blue paper cut into a parallelogram, over which, at the bottom, has been stuck a white paper circle representing the guitar's sound hole. A fragment of printed music is stuck over the right side of the blue sheet/fingerboard. In formal terms, this is a relatively complex image. The picture plane is rendered flat by the use of the wallpaper, which has the effect of projecting the other elements of the still life forward from the sur- face. The sound-hole, a hollow gap, is represented by the lightest tone, not the absence of light; it is placed physically forward of other elements of the composition. A cavity thus becomes a form of projec- tion. 15 This play with two dimensions is taken further in the drawing of the wineglass. This sketch is a complex analytical image, showing both the profile and plastic aspects of the object, with seemingly arbi- trary use of chiaroscuro. Coming from the earlier language of Analytic</page><page sequence="9">450 The Musical Quarterly T4?i BAT SIST ENGAGE': {:? !i ., ,: Figure 2. Guitar, Sheet-music and Wine Glass (1912).

The imitation wood-graining works in this image, as it does in all Cubist paintings, as a signifier of the material make-up of the guitar body or other objects made of wood. And at the same time, it points to the alternative reality of the world of art; it is real painted wood in a painted world. The newspaper fragment continues this game, the word "Jou," standing for the word "journal" (and an abbreviation of, for example, jouer, joueur, and jouailler). It is both a fragment of reality and another two-dimensional signifier (signifying newspaper). The sheets of colored paper, black and blue, also help the flatness of the image in their undifferentiated tonal character. In turning to the other collage element, the fragment of sheet music, we shall expand this discussion to the role that the represented objects play in terms of a wider con- textual framework, particularly in relation to music. Picasso has selected a section of a popular song, "Sonnet" (1892). The music is by Marcel Legay and the text by Pierre Ronsard. The song has been described by Jeffrey Weiss as "a plain and elegant 'vanitas' on love, beauty and fleeting youth." The section reads "[pen] dant qu'etes bel[le]" (while you are beautiful).16 The music is a pas- sage in the dominant of B flat, which implies a number of possible cadences, but it is cut off before it resolves. This nonresolution of the music is appropriate for the whole image, the pasting together of disparate elements. The guitar here operates as an element of still life, placed on the table with the newspaper and wineglass. It therefore can most obviously be read as a central element of vanitas. In general, musical instruments in still-life painting carry the significance of the passing of time: mortal- ity.'7 In addition, as we have already seen, guitars are central props in paintings of lovers (for example, Watteau's The Love Duet [La Gamme d'Amour] c. 1715). Thus, the actual piece of music and the guitar act together to reinforce the theme of love or, more specifi- cally, transient love. But this is only one half of one of the opposi- tions set up in this work. To see its antithesis we need to turn to the newspaper fragment. It comes from a copy of Le Journal of 18 November 1912 and consists of a headline dispatched from Constantinople, which reads "La Bataille S'Est Engage" ("The Battle is Joined"). As Patricia Leigh- ten has shown,18 this is edited from the full headline: "La Bataille S'Est Engage [e Furieuse sur les Lignes de Tchatldja"]. Thus, a head- line from a war that is well under way is made to signify the first en- gagement in hostilities; it can also be seen as a metaphor for Picasso's</page><page sequence="11">452 The Musical Quarterly own engagement with the subject of the Balkan War and his explora- tion of the formal challenges represented by the use of the disparate materials in collage. It also sets up an opposition or a conflict within the theme of love-strife. It tells us that love, the principle of associa- tion in Empedocles' system, and transience (or strife), the principle of dissolution, are philosophical opposites.19 They are also, of course, the human principles that are the irreconcilable stuff of poetry. According to Leighten's argument, Picasso rejected patriotic jingo- ism as a "vertical invader," to use John Berger's phrase.20 He had an ambivalent attitude to French national culture and did not embrace the idea of war in the same way as some of his Cubist colleagues. Nevertheless, "Picasso, though from a neutral country, still would have had to justify his noncombatant position, given the passionate rhetoric aroused by the threat of a general European war."21 He chose to do so, in part through his art, in a work whose subject matter, the cafe, reflected the setting where world affairs were discussed and debated, an environment with a wallpapered interior. By combining a French daily newspaper with mass circulation, a popular song, high art and traditional Western artistic genres-still life/vanitas containing a "Spanish" guitar-he created a dialectical image. In this work, the fragile pleasures of a civilized peace-popular love songs, wine, and high art-are set in opposition to news of destruction. This material, focusing on acts of destruction conflated with the metaphor of (re)cre- ation, the making of art, acts as a counterpoint to the theme of love expressed in the musical elements. The drawing of the glass is also relevant in this regard. Picasso has inserted a drawing from the Hermetic stage of Cubism, a difficult image to read unless one is familiar with its visual language. Working under the security of Kahnweiler's contracts, Picasso was at liberty to develop a language of representations signifying the Cubist sense of difficult and contradictory experience, in what was largely a private, avant-garde environment. The development of collage was in part an attempt to clarify such a Cubist view of reality, to make more legible the reality of their situation--a conceptual rather than perceptual approach to realism.22 Such a drawing as that of the glass placed within the context of a collage stands as an emblem of high, difficult, fine art practice. Juxtaposed with the popular music-hall song, a cultural artifact familiar to most people at that time, another opposition of cultural expression is set up, this time one between high and low, although it should be noted that the familiarity would not necessarily have been through the language of music notation, which, like the glass, can only be understood by those familiar with the language.</page><page sequence="12">Picasso's Musical Morphology 453 The use of such musical notation is important in another regard; it draws attention to the use of sign systems. The use of musical script, a set of signs operating within a system of difference, is, as we have seen, only one among a number of sign systems operating in this work. As with the inclusion of words on the newspaper, musical notes have an arbitrary relationship to the signified (symbol). This arbitrari- ness is made even more apparent as Picasso has left the words, libretto headline, etc., and the music unresolved in terms of their original meaning. To be more specific, in C. S. Peirce's terms, the glass and the guitar are diagrammatic; whereas the newspaper and wallpaper function in a complex way (like the wood grain) as both signifiers of the general (iconic) concepts, the newspaper/wallpaper operate as they do within the frame of art and are, so to speak, their own signified, real objects brought from the world outside the frame.23 The use of an abbreviated language of signs and the conflation of oppositions that are apparent in Picasso's collages have their origins in the Hermetic Cubist painting of the period around the year 1911. The work Ma Jolie (Woman with Zither or Guitar) (winter 1911-12) exem- plifies the development of a language that is both private and public, based on the iconography of a shared public experience. This work is formally extremely complex, verging on the indeci- pherable. However, with the aid of the few available clues, the sub- ject begins to emerge. A basic figure devoid of physiognomic detail is sitting on a chair with a music stand to her left and a guitar on her lap--not a zither, because of the character of the sound-hole and the number of strings, six. The space in which the figure and objects are placed is, as with the work we have discussed above, extremely shal- low. The anti-illusionistic implications of the words that give the painting its title and the music's treble clef and staff contribute to the flatness of the picture space in a way that anticipates the later papiers coll6s. The subject matter--a woman playing/holding a plucked string instrument-has its antecedents in the high art of the preceding cen- turies. The most obvious model (as has been mentioned often) is in the paintings of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. His importance in this regard is no doubt partly due to a Francophile conception of art his- tory. Nevertheless, the connection is sound enough, and, indeed, I would suggest that the relationship goes deeper than the purely formal one. For example, in Corot's series of paintings (between 1866-70) on the theme of the Artist's Studio, the art of painting is often shown alongside that of music. These works of women with easel paintings and mandolins focus on moods of melancholy, on the meditation/ reverie of art. His earlier pastoral paintings, the Concert (1844) and</page><page sequence="13">454 The Musical Quarterly ::.. ..... ' ro l Figure 3. Ma Jolie (winter 1911-12). Oil on canvas, 383/8" x 253/4".

Homer and the Shepherds (1845), for example, both relate to the tradi- tion of works on the subject of music-making in the country. The former shows a woman playing a cello--the instrument's shape echo- ing the pose of her companion-while the others listen. The latter shows the blind Homer playing to a small group of onlookers. Both convey a mood of rapt attention, suggesting the power of music to transport. Another work in his oeuvre with close formal links to Pi- casso's Ma Jolie is Gipsy Girl with Mandolin (1874), a work that associ- ates the gipsy, an outsider, with music and romantic reverie. Al- though this work is more dreamy than Picasso's, it brings to mind the use of music in his early work discussed above. As Robert Rosenblum has pointed out,24 Picasso also was aware of this theme through a series of picture postcards inspired by the popular Ambroise Thomas opera Mignon, showing the title character playing a mandolin. The romantic nature of the setting and the pose create, clearly, a kitsch counterpart to Corot's original painting. Whether or not Picasso saw the postcard before or after he saw the Corot painting is not important. Whichever way round the influence worked, they acted as contemporary sources of reinforcement. Corot's painting Young Women of Sparta (c. 1868-70) is also an important precedent, for this work combines the subject of music with a pose of more explicit sexual allusion. Here, the mandolin is placed in the lap</page><page sequence="15">456 The Musical Quarterly of the reclining figure, making clear the sexual symbolism-the womb- like belly of the instrument and the provocatively placed sound-hole. Picasso's Ma Jolie also possesses these essential features. Within the formal language of Analytic Cubism, the conflation of subject elements occurs; that is, the musical instrument and figure are literally allowed to merge. The use of a restricted palette-earth colors-and of faceted planes, within a work that only provides a few keys to the specificity of objects, makes parts of the subject/objects referred to interchangeable. Where does the human figure stop and the guitar or background start? Ma Jolie can be seen to take the rela- tionship between similar shapes-the guitar body/figure of the model, as in Corot's Concert-a stage further so that they become truly inter- changeable. The sound-hole and fingers become explicitly sexual, and the predilection Picasso has for puns (e.g., "jou"-jouissance) would suggest that the act of playing a musical instrument can also be read as masturbation, "playing with yourself.25" Such a reading is given support by the fact that we know who the woman in the painting is and what Picasso's relationship to her was. To examine this reading further, we need to return to the title of the work. The well-known musical reference in the title is from a popular song, "Derniere Chanson," which in itself is a kind of compound composition. Its three opening verses, written by H. Christine, were set to music by a popular music-hall artist, Harry Fragson. Fragson also wrote the words to the refrain, which he set to the music of a passage from a ballet, In the Shadows, by Herman Finck.26 As Rosenblum has shown, the title has a number of ambiguous meanings.27 First, it seems to function as a mocking evocation of a museum title plate.28 Then, through the reference to this popular tune, an opposition is set up between the difficult language of high art and the easier language of low art. Most significant for the reading I mentioned above, the title is also a private reference to Picasso's then lover, Marcelle Hum- bert, whom he called "Eva." Writing to Kahnweiler, he said that he loved her and would write it on his pictures. In this case, he wrote his love/desire through, rather than directly on, his painting. 29 This work sets in play a series of oppositions--public (Mignon), private (Eva); high (language of Cubism and reference to Corot), low (popular song and reference to popular iconography, postcard). To emphasize this elision, a similar set of relationships and devices can also be seen in a small, intentionally private work intended to woo Picasso's new love, Gabrielle Depeyre (Gaby). It is dated 22 February 1916 (only a few months after Eva's death). It con- sists of a sheet of black paper on which six cameos are stuck: two</page><page sequence="16">Picasso's Musical Morphology 457 photographs of Picasso and Gaby and three images of flowers, sheet music, and guitars, in increasing stages of Cubist development. The final cameo is an allegorical portrait of Gaby lying naked with a putto hovering overhead. The three musical still-lives can be read as emblems of the lover, as discussed above, and as equivalents of the figure. Like Corot's Concert, they echo the figure's recumbent position, but in the opposite direction. These are resolved in the final portrait. The central decorated proclamation, the title Je t'aime Gaby, contains another conflation, in the form of calligraphic lovemaking; Picasso's name is entwined with hers.30 This metamorphic process found further development in Syn- thetic Cubism. In conclusion let us consider another papier coll6 work, Picasso's Bowl with Fruit, Violin and Wineglass (autumn/winter 1912), one of his most complex collage works. In formal terms, this work is far more sophisticated than the collage considered earlier. Here, the relationship between ground and figure is more ambiguous, and overlap is more prevalent. As Rosalind Krauss writes in her detailed discussion of the formal innovations in this work, "It is the eradication of the original surface, and the reconstitution of it through the figure of its own absence that is the master term of the entire condition of collage as a system of signifiers.'"31 The material elements consist of newspaper, color illustrations, painted wood-grained paper, black, white, blue, brown, and cream painted paper, and a considerable amount of over-drawing. Again, the content of the newspaper is significant. The section in the upper right has the headline cut off so that it reads "arition" (apparition/appear- ance). It is a report of a seance, during which contact is made with the dead ("C'est elle!"/"It is she!"). The fragment over which a wine- glass has been drawn is a romance about two characters, Don Cesar and Chico. The rest of the newspaper fragments report elements of contemporary modem life--medical reports (violin), automobile and racetrack news below the fruit, financial news, a sports column headed "La Vie Sportive," and two short items about a female mur- derer and a female boxer placed near the white plane on the left. Significant by its absence is politics. The illustrations of fruit (commercial art/low) look as if they overlap, but in fact they have been cut to give such an illusion. The play with illusion is another element of Picasso's engagement with questions of realism, naturalistic representation within a nonnaturalist frame. Perhaps the most significant illusionistic play is with the simul- taneous depiction of two elements within a single image.

These are juxtaposed to the newspaper fragments that refer to the female murderer and boxer. The result of this type of operation is to make the human subject, usually a woman, into an object. As with Ma Jolie, the figure of the woman becomes interchangeable with the musical instrument. (See Man Ray's Violon d'Ingres [1924] for a similar objectification of a female figure.) As Perloff points out, "These female curves may belong to the woman whose face is also the violin top (two eyes, nose, whiskers?, trunk top), and the sexual allusion (both shape and symbol) is picked up by the apple and pear pictures in the upper left."33 I think this less convincing, although it is consistent with the reading of the other works I have considered and John Russell's read- ing of Picasso's collage Guitar (spring 1913).34 Nevertheless, the meta- morphic process whereby Picasso signals two images within the same sign is wittily commented on by the newspaper fragment about the seance, the sudden appearance of a dead woman--"It is she!" Finally, it is worth recalling that the word collage (pasting) is itself also a slang expression for a couple's living together (stuck together) in illicit union. The past participle, coll6, also means "faked" or "pretended." "The word collage thus becomes itself an emblem of the 'systematic play of difference', the 'mise en question' of representation that is inherent in its verbal-visual structure."35 It is consistent with Picasso's approach that puns and allusions should be "hidden" in his works. The references in the newspaper fragments - medicine/morphine (drugs), sport/games (play), unusual women: boxing, murdering, and appearing from the dead--can be seen to play a part in a complex set of relationships in dialogue with images that not only relate to a tradi- tion of symbolism in Western art, but also take such symbols further so that the objects within the frame stand equally as symbol and refer- ent. They become truly synthetic. Picasso selects musical subjects for a number of reasons. They allow him to allude to themes that are important for his perception of the role of art, as both a public and private expression. Music func- tions in such works as a sign system through the use of manuscript and as a symbol of civilization. It is a metaphor for the act of making art. Through references to music-halls and forms of popular entertainment,</page><page sequence="20">Picasso's Musical Morphology 461 Picasso allows himself to slip between the realms of high and low cultural practices. And through the inclusion of certain types of instruments as symbols of both high and low cultural expression, he makes further connections with the symbolic use of instruments. He is able to fashion equations of physical materials, representational mean- ings and metamorphic ones, and associational values. In particular, his materials conjure musical instruments in the process of metamorphosis into human figures, and he endows them with thoughts of love or sex. It is this later development that plays a seminal role in Picasso's later surrealist works, where the sign readily carries more than one object of interpretation.36 Notes I should like to express my profound thanks to Dr. James Lawson for his many helpful comments on drafts of this article. His input has benefited my argument in ways too numerous to cite accurately. Thanks are also due to my Honors students, with whom I first explored many of these ideas. For their comments and interest I am grateful. 1. Among the few articles that touch on this area are Werner Spies, "La Guitare Anthropomorphe," Revue de l'Art 12 (1971): 89-92. In this relatively short essay, Spies surveys the motif of the guitar in Picasso's Cubist works, arguing that the instru- ment takes on anthropomorphic characteristics. A more substantial account is given in Johannes Langer's essay "Figur und Saiteninstrument bei Picasso: Ein Bildthema im Kubismus," Pantheon 40, no. 2 (Apr.-June 1982): 98-113. He examines the develop- ment of the motif of the figure playing a string instrument in Picasso's oeuvre from 1909 to 1920. He argues that there is a move from a juxtaposition to a fusion of figure and string instrument, favoring an erotic interpretation of the string instrument as a metaphor of the female body. He also considers Corot's work as a precedent of this idea and proposes that this theme continued to occupy Picasso in his later work. The essay discusses different works than I do and does not provide the same contextual background. Also it does not examine the relationship between music and other themes in Picasso's work in the way I have attempted. I believe Langer's essay adds weight to some of my points, but our arguments are quite distinct. The most recent article is by Jeffrey S. Weiss, "Picasso, Collage and the Music Hall," in Modern Art and Popular Culture: Readings in High and Low ed. by Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gop- nik (London: Thames and Hudson, 1990), 82-115. This interesting essay relates Picasso's collages to the French music hall. While it does not consider musical instru- ments as symbols, it does raise significant issues about the impact of popular music, and other aspects of entertainment, on Synthetic Cubism. 2. Tenora are more prevalent in the paintings of Braque, so it will not be dealt with in this paper. However, I would suggest that the use of such a folk instrument in Braque's works sets up interesting dialectical relationships with his other musical refer- ences, such as Bach, Mozart, Kubelick, sonata, aria, etc., raising issues about cultural boundaries in ways that are related to Picasso's concerns discussed above. The tenora, a folk instrument from Catalonia, was first identified, I believe, by Lewis Kachur.

In the eighteenth century, it was not regarded as appropriate for the violin to transgress the separate spheres of gender, but as Hester Lynch Piozzi wrote in her diary of a female exponent of the instrument: "Madame Gautherot's wonderful Execution on the Fiddle;--but say the Critics a Violin is not an instrument for 'Ladies' to man- age, very likely!

For a history of the guitar, see James Tyler, The Early Guitar: A History and Handbook (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980). Significantly, he notes that most writers agree that the guitar originated in the Iberian peninsula (15). This establishes the same pedigree for the guitar as Patricia Leighten notes for Iberian images in her book, Re-Ordering the Universe: Picasso and Anarchism, 1897-1914 (Princeton: Prince- ton University Press, 1989), 79-81. 14. "The guitar still survives in Spain, where it is not only the possession of blind beggars, but a thoroughly serious instrument with an advanced technique and great possibilities for modern music" (Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians 5th ed., ed. by Eric Bloom, vol. 3 [1954], 848). 15. Picasso's construction Guitar (1912) (See frontispiece) takes this reversal further by replacing the negative space of the sound-hole with the positive space of a (phal- lic) tube. In addition, Picasso may be making fun of the Impressionists by construct- ing an equation--absence of light must be understood as absence of color. 16. See Weiss, 94. 17.

The Greek philosopher Empedocles (c. 493-c. 433 B.C.) taught that reality is compounded of the four elements, fire, water, air, and earth, which continually min- gle and separate under the influence of the alternately predominating forces of love (unifier) and strife (divider). 20.

He argues that the Cubists' objections to nineteenth-century views of realism devel- oped in the following manner: 1. What is described or represented is seen only superficially, that is in terms of its outward appearance rather than its inner reality. 2. There are many real forces, from inner feelings to underlying social and histori- cal movements, which are neither accessible to ordinary observation nor ade- quately, if at all, represented in how things appear. 3. The medium in which the representation occurs (in our case painting) is radi- cally different from the objects represented in it, so that the effect of "lifelike repre- sentation," "the reproduction of reality," is at best a particular artistic convention, or at worst a falsification making us take the forms of representation as real.
