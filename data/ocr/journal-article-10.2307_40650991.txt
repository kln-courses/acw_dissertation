<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMAGINATION AND REALISM IN SOVIET SCIENCE FICTION: SINIAVSKY'S "BEZ SKIDOK" AND TERTS'S "PKHENTS" Kevin Reese, University of North Carolina Given that he wrote outside of- or in direct opposition to- the constraints of the Soviet censor, it is no surprise that the works of Abram Terts seem funda- mentally unbounded, free to take whatever direction proves most creatively productive. In keeping with this lack of restriction, it can also be observed that Terts is unafraid to venture outside of the domain of Literature and borrow from the "outer" genres, should it suit his needs. One genre represented in Terts's work is science fiction, the best example of which being the 1956 story "Pkhents,"1 which chronicles the loneliness and isolation of an alien who lives for thirty-two years in Soviet Russia disguised as a human. By examining "Pkhents" and Terts's other works of fiction alongside Siniavsky's literary crit- icism, this article will show how Siniavsky's impatience with the state of sci- ence fiction within Soviet literature helped Terts make creative and innovative use of the then-moribund genre.2 From such a starting point, Terts was able to make significant contributions to the questions of alien bodily forms and alien perspectives, questions that are fundamental to science fiction as a whole. 1. "Pkhents" first appeared in print in Polish translation in the January-February 1966 issue of the Paris-based Polish émigré journal Kultur a (no. 219: 66-84). A few months later, an En- glish translation was published in the April issue of Encounter (no. 26: 3-13) (Kolonosky 115). In Russia, "Pkhents" was published in Terts's 1992 Sobranie sochinenii v dvukh tomakh, issued by the Moscow publisher "Start." Unless otherwise indicated, all other works by Terts cited here were first published in Russia in this collection. 2. Siniavsky regarded the pseudonym "Abram Terts" as an "alternate being" (Holmgren 965). In a 1990 interview, Siniavsky's reply to the question "Who is Abram Tertz?" was: "Abram Tertz is a mask, but a mask that is tightly fitted to my soul" (Nepomnyashchy 1991, 8). So while it might be more convenient in terms of the discussion to refer to works ascribed to Terts as having been written by Siniavsky, such a conflation would be inappropriate. Thus, while this article may read as a comparative study of two authors- Siniavsky and Terts- it is important to keep in mind that all of these works were written by the same hand. For a deeper discussion of complexities of pseudonyms, see the second chapter of Jehanne Gheith's 2004 book Finding the Middle Ground.

Like Vladimir Ma- iakovsky, who was Siniavsky's "model for originality" throughout his career (Kolonosky 68),3 Terts was able to leap past his contemporaries into the cre- ative future, in a sense obeying Maiakovsky's 1918 "Prikaz po armii iskusstva" [Order to the Army of Art]: "Enough with this walking, Futurists,/ into the future- a leap! [Dovol'no shagat', futuristy,/ v budushchee pryzhok!]" (Maiakovskii 1: 176).4 Employing Siniavsky's critical views of science fiction, this article will attempt to measure the length of Terts 's pryzhok, specifically in terms of creative innovation. Among Siniavsky's "legitimate" works of literary criticism- as opposed to Terts 's "exaggerated prose" [utrirovannaia proza]-wQ can find a little-stud- ied article that examines the numerous restrictions on 1950s Soviet science fic- tion. This article, which appeared in the January 1960 issue of Voprosy liter- atury, is entitled "Bez skidok: o sovremennom nauchno-fantasticheskom romane" [No Allowances: Concerning the Modern Science Fiction Novel].5 In terms of a window into Siniavsky's system of ideas and literary aesthetics, this article is easily as important as the much better known Chto takoe sotsialis- ticheskii realizm [What is Socialist Realism, 1956].6 "Bez skidok" displays both a wide knowledge of science fiction, and a deep concern for the future of the genre, the best examples of which Siniavsky regarded as worthy of publi- cation in Novyi mir (Lourie 181). The main concern that Siniavsky addresses in it is that many then-contemporary Soviet science fiction authors, too preoc- cupied with scientific and historical realism, sought to prevent any fantasy from corrupting their "reality." He believed that by giving in to this preoccu- pation, these writers purged their works of the very fantastic elements that, in his opinion, define the genre. Siniavsky refers to a "relapse into old, mistaken views" which tried to "hold back, confine science fiction, to move it within the bounds of 'moderation and tidiness'" (Siniavskii 46). He chides Soviet science fiction writers for "'holding dreams in place' so that they don't fly too far away," and with some bitterness states that in Soviet science fiction as it was then practiced, fantasy and realism were considered to be inversely propor- tional: "Realism in science-fiction literature is sometimes understood as a re- 3. Kolonosky devotes the sixth chapter (66-80) of his 2003 book Literary Insinuations: Sort- ing Out Sinyavsky's Irreverence to Siniavsky's relationship, both as a reader and as a critic, with the works of Maiakovsky. 4. All translations from the Russian, unless otherwise indicated, are mine. 5. The article has more commonly been translated under the title "No Discount," as in the 1971 collection For Freedom of Imagination, translated by Peppard and Tikos. 6. Chto takoe sotsialisticheskii realizm was first published in French translation in the jour- nal Esprit, no. 2, February 1959: 335-67 (Nepomnyashchy 1995, 332). While it was not in- cluded in Terts 's 1992 collected works, it has been published in Russia in the 2000 collection of essays O nichtozhestve liter atury russkoi (126-92) edited by Svetlana Gaier.</page><page sequence="3">Imagination and Realism in Soviet Science Fiction 441 straint of fantasy: the less a novel is fantastic, the more realistic it will be" (47, 50). Siniavsky regards the then-current trends in Soviet science fiction as mov- ing towards a literary landscape in which "a work of science fiction is even less fantastic than our everyday life" (47). The thrust of his article is partly a de- mand for a renewed use of the well thought-out and logically derived elements of the fantastic that are characteristic of the type of science fiction that Sini- avsky regarded as worthy of being called Literature, but, more importantly, is a demand that imagination be reintroduced into the genre. He concludes by stating that it is absolutely necessary to increase the "rights and responsibili- ties" of science fiction, and to expect great things from the genre, "without al- lowances [bez skidok] for literary backwardness" (59). Even this short summary points to a substantive similarity between "Bez skidok" and Chto takoe sotsialisticheskii realizm. Each work seeks to con- front the problems of a genre and ends with a call for reinvigoration based on new or reevaluated criteria. Kolonosky notes this similarity: As in What Is Socialist Realism, in "No Discount" Sinyavsky focuses on the big picture, that is, on literary developmental issues, on prevailing critical contingencies in the Soviet period with specific reference to science fiction. Given the presence of the fantastic in his fiction and the hope that he expressed for it in the conclusion of What Is Socialist Realism, his discussion of science fiction is telling in more than one sense. (Kolonosky 56-57) In their introduction to the 1971 collection of Siniavsky 's literary criticism entitled For Freedom of Imagination, Laszlo Tikos and Murray Peppard write that science fiction was "a topic dear to his heart, which interested him greatly because it offered excellent opportunities for exploring a field closely related to his fiction- the correlation between fantasy and reality" (Peppard and Tikos xii). With Siniavsky's critical stance regarding science fiction in mind, we can now return to "Pkhents." To anyone familiar with the science fiction that was being written in the Soviet Union in 1956, "Pkhents" is a revelation. It must be remembered that the watershed event for Thaw science fiction, the publi- cation of Ivan Efremov's novel Tumannost' Andromedy [The Galaxy Androm- eda], was not to occur until the following year. The careers of such writers as Boris and Arkady Strugatsky (indisputably the most well known and influen- tial writer7 of Soviet science fiction), Ilia Varshavsky and Vladimir Sav- chenko- to name only a few other key writers- were still in their infancy or had not yet been born. But even taking into account some of the early achievements of these writers, "Pkhents" still stands out in terms of its vivid and convincing portrayal of an alien being. To see one basic way in which "Pkhents" deviates from the norm, we need only consider the all-too-human 7. The Strugatsky brothers emphatically referred to themselves as one writer, and wrote their respective individual works under the pseudonyms S. Iaroslavtsev (Arkady) and S. Vititskii (Boris).</page><page sequence="4">442 Slavic and East European Journal aliens portrayed in Efremov's seminal novel. They illustrate one of the prob- lems formulated by Fredric Jameson when he writes about the possibility that "genuine difference, genuine alienness or otherness, is impossible and un- achievable, and that even there where it seems to have been successfully rep- resented, in reality we find the mere structural play of purely human themes and topics" (Jameson 124). "Pkhents" manages to sidestep this pitfall by find- ing a very satisfying equilibrium between the alien and the familiar: the fact that a cactus-like alien with four arms and eyes on his fingers and toes can cram himself into a human suit and human clothes and live for thirty-two years as a hunchback accountant named Andrei Kazimirovich Sushinsky is a combination of the most fantastic and the most mundanely real. The alien's unusual form is particularly relevant in the context of "Bez skidok," where Siniavsky is extremely critical of Soviet science fiction writers' consistently portraying intelligent alien beings as near-exact copies of humans. The fact that Terts binds his alien's unusual body in a human disguise (albeit de- formed) could be read as a comment on the imaginative constraints that Sin- iavsky criticizes in "Bez skidok." Siniavsky's confronting of this problem takes the form of a close examination of Georgy Martynov's 1957 Kallisto, a science fiction novel concerning Earth's first contact with intelligent aliens. Quoting Martynov, Siniavsky writes: The Kallistians have black skin. However, "the features of their elongated faces were the same as those of the white race, and were beautiful, beautiful from an earthly* point of view." Men- tioning the black skin of these visitors from space, the author hastens to impart to them a fully- fully!- European appearance. These, apparently, are his notions of the one and only type of human beauty. (Siniavskii 54)9 The following passage from Kallisto comes just before the Kallistians are seen for the first time, when the people of Earth are waiting for the door of their spherical spaceship to open. The narrator lists the stereotypical mon- strous forms that the aliens could possibly take: Now there would emerge... Who? Monstrous spiders with hairy bodies and the fixed, cruel gaze of huge eyes, the eyes of an octopus?... Something resembling humans, but with six arms and snouts on their faces?... Gigantic beetles with stiff, membranous wings and human heads?... Or perhaps all the fantasy of Earth was not capable of predicting their outer appearance? (Martynov 91) While Siniavsky does not cite this particular passage, he does address the his- tory of alien body forms in science fiction to which this passage implicitly refers. To him, both monstrous and anthropomorphic alien body types are dis- 8. Martynov's emphasis (Martynov 94). 9. Martynov is not alone in giving aliens black skin and European features. In his 1961 novel Mars probuzhdaetsia [Mars Awakens], Konstantin Volkov describes a Mars inhabited by short, black-skinned people whose features are often described in European terms of beauty.</page><page sequence="5">Imagination and Realism in Soviet Science Fiction 443 tastefully extreme in that they are default images, rather than the result of ac- tual creative thought: For a long time in science fiction literature, space was populated by monsters, deformed, in- comprehensible, and hostile to Man. Wells 's octopus-like Martians became the tradition and quickly transformed into a cliché. Perhaps to distance themselves from this cliché, many con- temporary writers are gravitating to the opposite extreme: they now emphasize in intelligent life in the Universe a similarity with Man. But even here cliché has not been avoided: space is now filled with perfect Adonises [ideal' nye krasavtsy]. (Siniavskii 55) Thus it is not surprising that this tendency towards a nearly universal (human) body type can be observed in many other works of Soviet science fiction. Siniavsky also refers to Efremov's 1959 novella Serdtse zmei [Heart of the Serpent], which deals with first contact, this time with fluorine-based (as op- posed to carbon-based) life forms who physically resemble humans in every respect save their green skin. In the novella, one of the human crew frames this physical similarity as an unequivocal law of nature. He says that "it is only the lower forms of life that vary so greatly in form; the higher life forms are, the more closely they resemble one another" (Efremov 3: 423). Siniavsky finds this argument both scientifically unconvincing and artistically barren, and refutes it with a quotation from Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, one of the fore- fathers both of Soviet science fiction and the Soviet space program: In raising objections to this theory of the unity of possible solutions, one wants to recall the words of K. Tsiolkovsky [from his 1895 Grezy o Zemle i nebe [Reveries of Heaven and Earth]]: "...Life is spread throughout the Universe. This life is infinitely varied. If life on Earth varies under comparatively limited circumstances, then think how infinitely varied life must be in the Universe, where all conditions are possible!" (Siniavskii 56)10 Efremov's fluorine-based humans lead Siniavsky to conclude that "the author was more daring in his scientific hypothesis than in his aesthetics" (Siniavskii 56). This is a crucial statement in Siniavsky's literary worldview: he is ulti- 10. The planetary scientist and popular science writer David Grinspoon, in his 2004 book Lonely Planets: The Natural Philosophy of Alien Life, argues that many of the modern ideas about alien life have their origin in the French poet, novelist and natural philosopher Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle's 1686 book Entretiens sur la Pluralité des Mondes [Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]: "Fontenelle argued for infinite variety among intelligent life-forms on other planets, mirroring the bountiful diversity of life on earth. He imagined that life elsewhere would take turns that we cannot predict, as it adapted to local environmental conditions" (Grin- spoon 25). Thus this concept of pluralism- through which Siniavsky connects himself with Tsiolkovsky- goes back several centuries. Fontenelle's work was first translated into Russian by the satirist and poet Antiokh Kantemir and the concept of pluralism was used soon thereafter by Lomonosov in his famous 1743 ode "Vechernee razmyshlenie..." [Evening meditation...]: "YcTa npeMy^pbix HaM raacjrr: / TaM pa3Hbix MHoacecTBO cbctob; / HecneTHbi cojimja TaM ropflT, / Hapoflbi TaM h Kpyr bckob [The lips of the most wise tell us: / There, there is a multi- tude of various lights; / Numberless suns burn there, / Peoples are there and a cycle of ages] (Makogonenko 144). Incidentally, both men were chastised by the Holy Synod for disseminat- ing such radical ideas" (E. Brown 82).</page><page sequence="6">444 Slavic and East European Journal mately less concerned with the scientific realism of science fiction than with its creative consistency. So while Siniavsky does open "Bez skidok" with the argument that the realistic and the fantastic need not be mutually exclusive, the progression of the article makes it clear that, in literature, artistic concerns must trump scientific concerns. Thus, for Siniavsky, the cliché of monsters and Adonises represents not so much a scientific impossibility as a failure of imagination. Immediately after quoting Tsiolkovsky, he writes: We invoke this higher authority, however, not in order to restrict these or other scientific views. We, naturally, are concerned first of all with the purely literary side of the question: with variety in terms of image, plot and style in the solutions of cosmic and various other problems. Meanwhile, in modern science fiction what is often felt is a fetteredness of ideas, a slavish de- pendence on images and plots long present in literature, a standardization of artistic solutions. (Siniavskii 56) [emphasis added] It seems likely that Siniavsky (as Terts) was already beginning to conceive these arguments when he invented his Andrei Kazimirovich, a monster with the soul of an Adonis. It also is interesting to conjecture that, while criticiz- ing Martynov and Efremov for lack of imagination in creating their aliens, he might have had his own Andrei Kazimirovich in mind. It is known that Terts was considering the question of alien bodily forms when he was writing "Pkhents." In a 1990 interview with Catherine Nepomnyashchy, Siniavsky, in an answer to a question about H. G. Wells, says: Sometimes, under his influence, different, reverse solutions appeared in my works. I employed that technique in the story "Pkhents," for example. I thought what if I were to depict a creature from another world or from another planet not as a monster (that is, I took my impetus from War of the Worlds), not as an ideal youth (by the way, many such communist utopias were writ- ten-for instance, Bogdanov's Red Star, in which he describes a journey to Mars, where com- munism has already been built), but in ordinary guise and living in a communal apartment- that was the task I set myself. (Quoted in Nepomnyashchy 1991, 14)11 Siniavsky's term "ordinary guise" is interesting when we recall that Andrei Kazimirovich's true form is hidden not only under human clothes, but also within a rubbery "human" suit that not only hides him among humans, but also wedges him into the notion that intelligent life has one form alone. The contention put forth in Serdtse zmei that intelligent life has a uniform body type made a deep impression on Soviet science fiction, and much of later Soviet science fiction uses a default humanoid shape when describing aliens. Many of the works of the Strugatskys, for instance, assume such close correspondence between human and alien body types that humans are able to blend into some alien populations undetected. Some non-humanoid aliens are nevertheless featured in their writing, most notably the Stranniki, who are mentioned in several works and whose existence is inferred only through 11. Interestingly, Siniavsky writes in "Bez skidok" that Martians (and, by extension, all aliens) should not "look like the people in our communal apartment" (51). This observation seems to playfully refer to Andrei Kazimirovich, who only seems to look like an inhabitant of a kommunalka.</page><page sequence="7">Imagination and Realism in Soviet Science Fiction 445 their abandoned technology and artifacts, as well as their possible interfer- ence in human affairs. They are never portrayed physically, and are assumed to have evolved beyond any strictures of physical form. Examples from other authors include the discorporeal "body-snatcher" aliens from Aleksandr Mirer's 1969 novella Glavnyi polderi [The Crucial Afternoon], or the aliens in Yury Braider and Nikolai Chadovich's 1986 story "Poselok na kraiu galak- tiki" [The Village at the Edge of the Galaxy] who condense into a poor ap- proximation of a human form from scattered cosmic dust. So while later writ- ers would explore non-humanoid body types, such explorations were more or less nonexistent in the Soviet science fiction of 1956. Thus Terts's Andrei Kazimirovich is a precious rarity in the science fiction of the time. But it should be said that Terts's alien did not emerge from a vacuum: in "Bez skidok" Siniavsky does find some works deserving of praise for their treatment of alienness. Having discussed Kallisto, he writes approvingly of another, in his opinion more successful, exploration of the alien form. The work he examines is Efremov's 1947 novella Zvezdnye korabli [The Star- ships], which he praises for the author's nuanced approach to this problem: In this sense, Efremov's old story Zvezdnye korabli rings much more true. There, reconstruct- ing a portrait of a "visitor from the stars," the writer was able to manage both without clichéd monstrosities and candied delights. He showed the thinking being from another world as a con- crete, living face, neither beautiful nor ugly to our eyes, but simply different. In some ways it resembles Man, but at the same time does not; it is unique [svoeobraznoe]. (Siniavskii 56)12 Terts's presentation of an alien bodily form in "Pkhents" follows closely from Siniavsky 's understanding of Zvezdnye korabli: the aesthetics of an alien body need conform only to alien standards. Terts's particular approach is striking in that he takes pains to show his human audience both the beauty of an alien body and the ugliness of the human body when seen from an alien perspective. Several of Terts's works (all of which, to a greater or lesser degree, venture into the fantastic) go to great lengths to portray the human form from unusual, if not alien, perspectives. For instance, there are moments in both Sud idet [The Trial Begins, 1956] and Gololeditsa [Black Ice, usually translated as The Icicle, 196 1]13 that consider the recapitulation of the human embryo, i.e., the process by which ontogeny portrays phylogeny. In Sud idet, the lawyer Kar- linsky (in an allusion, both in content and in tone, to Jonathan Swift's 1729 12. Zvezdnye korabli portrays the discovery, by two Soviet paleontologists, of evidence of an alien visitation to Earth millions of years in the geological past. While Siniavsky is correct in praising Efremov's nuanced creation of an alien face, he does not observe that the novella is careful to preclude the possibility of anything too alien. During a discussion of what possible forms an alien body could take, one of the protagonists states "as concerns different forms of life- your various stone or metal beings- leave all that to the writers" (Efremov 3: 357). 13. Sud idet first appeared in Polish translation together with Chto takoe sotsialistichekii re- alizm in a 1959 volume published by the Paris-based Polish émigré journal Kultur a (Nepom- nyashchy 1995, 332). Gololeditsa was first published in Paris by the Institut literacki in 1961 in the collection Fantasticheskie povesti (Kolonosky 102).</page><page sequence="8">446 Slavic and East European Journal essay "A Modest Proposal") imagines that fetuses could be aborted while still in the "fish" stage of recapitulation and then raised in special ponds as food. Vasily, the narrator of Gololeditsa, recalls learning about recapitulation in school, and this knowledge inspires him to consider the unity of all things that have ever lived. Such examples point to Terts's interest not only in the alien form, but also in the malleability of the human form. This would certainly explain Siniavsky's impatience with humanoid aliens, since, as Terts, he fre- quently alters the traditional human body. Consider a moment close to the end of Liubimov [1963], 14 in which meteorological anomalies, due in part to the hero Lenia Tikhomirov's psychic experimenting, cause a young woman in the town to have a miscarriage: The influence of the thunder caused one girl to have a miscarriage: it was the size of a kitten but, incidentally, had a very well developed member, while its personality was in its beard and moustache. (Terts 2003, 104) Thus, to some degree, Terts adopts the very cliché of a universe inhabited by deformed monsters that, as Siniavsky, he criticizes in "Bez skidok," but turns the tables by considering the monstrous forms that humans can take, thus pre- senting humans as the incomprehensible horrors of the universe. In "Pkhents," this approach is most apparent in Andrei Kazimirovich's reaction at seeing Veronika (his fellow communal-apartment tenant) naked.15 Following their confrontation, he contemplates: Shame, after all, is man's fundamental virtue. That vague comprehension of one's irredeemable exterior, the instinctive fear of what is hidden beneath the cloth. [...] But were I in their place, I not only would never crawl out of my suit, but not even out of my coat, neither day nor night. I would have plastic surgery to make my legs shorter and make a hump on my back. Here, hunchbacks are certainly more decent than the rest, though they, too, are monsters [urody]. (Terts 2003, 147) Andrei Kazimirovich sees himself as the sole example of physical beauty to which he has access. Towards the end of the story, when he is able to slough off his human covering and examine his own, true body, the alien says: Perhaps, had I not lived thirty-two years in an alien land, it would not have occurred to me to admire my own exterior. But here I am the sole humble image of that lost harmonious beauty that is called my homeland. What else in the world is there for me to do but be carried away by myself? (Terts 2003, 159)16 14. Liubimov was first published in English translation (as The Makepeace Experiment) by Pantheon in 1965. 15. This passage has been closely examined by Dalton (93-95), Loune (152-53), and Nepomnyashchy (1995, 68-69). 16. Given Siniavsky's passion for Maiakovsky, it would not be out of place to compare this passage with the following lines from that poet's 1917 poem Chelovek [Man]: "KaK kq I ce6fl MHe He neTb, / ecnH Beet a- / cimoniHaa HeBH^anB, / ecnH Kaacßoe flBHHcemie Moe- / Heo- 6T&gt;HCHHMHoe Hyflo [How / not to sing of myself, / if all of me- / is entirely unusual, / if my every movement- / is an unexplainable wonder]" (Maiakovskii 1: 292).</page><page sequence="9">Imagination and Realism in Soviet Science Fiction 447 Thus Andrei Kazimirovich will never be able to fully adapt to his adopted world, since he will never be able to fully overcome the physical revulsion that he feels at the aliens that surround him.17 The reader, too, feels this revulsion: from the "sadism" of human food to the stinging perfume of the "other" Kostritskaia to the fact that the tempera- ture of human skin burns him like hot metal, Andrei Kazimirovich's experi- ence of human society causes this world, even to the human reader, to seem much more alien than the alien himself. The ostranenie thus conveyed in the narrative is an especially impressive achievement given how little Andrei Kazimirovich remembers of his homeworld, and thus has almost nothing with which to compare his experiences on Earth. Actually, Andrei Kazimirovich is no longer an alien, but is rather a hybrid of his own world and the "island" on which he is stranded. In fact, the passage in which Andrei Kazimirovich men- tally reproaches Leopold Sergeevich (the hunchback he mistakes for one of his own kind) for becoming too human is essentially a description of himself: He had gotten too much into the role, had become wild, had become human [ochelovechilsia], had too completely come to resemble the surrounding environment, and had given in to alien influence. He had forgotten his former name, betrayed his distant homeland, and, without help, would perish in short order. (Terts 2003, 152) Over the course of the narrative it becomes clear that these same changes have been wrought on Andrei Kazimirovich, and to such a degree that his life in disguise has become surprisingly human. He works as an accountant, though he once taught math at a middle school in Irkutsk. He lives in a com- munal apartment, with all of the Zoshchenko-esque petty rivalries this entails. Towards the end of the story, he retires and must live on a modest pension. These few details of Soviet byt point towards the alien's assimilation into human existence. Yet Andrei Kazimirovich, not the typical stranded hero (who is usually accustomed to some degree of adventure and danger), seems prepared by his former quiet alien existence to adapt to a similarly quiet "human" existence. As he takes pains to point out, his life prior to his arrival on Earth was no more remarkable than his present life. After all, the accident that stranded him on Earth occurred, as he says, "to put it crudely," en route to a resort (Terts 2003, 154). While conveying the difficulty and sadness of the fact that he cannot find his home star in the night sky- he does not even know "in which direction to pine"- he mentions that he is not an astronomer, nor does he practice any of the other professions usually attributed to science 17. Certainly the alien's outsider status begs for a consideration of the political/satirical sub- texts in "Pkhents." The existence of such subtexts is bolstered by the fact that Siniavsky quoted from "Pkhents" during his trial in an attempt to convey to the courtroom his own outsider sta- tus within Soviet society (Kolonosky 109). I have chosen not to confront questions of political interpretation mostly because they have been thoroughly addressed previously (see Kolonosky 107-14, Lourie 153-54, and Nepomnyashchy 1995, 70-72), but also because this article is meant to address a different set of questions.</page><page sequence="10">448 Slavic and East European Journal fiction characters. He says, "I went while they took me" [Ekhal-poka vezli] (Terts 2003, 154). He also asks that the reader not assume "that I came here with some ulterior motive. Re-settlement of peoples, a war of the worlds, and all that" (Terts 2003, 154). The phrase he uses, bor'ba mirov, is the Russian title of Wells 's War of the Worlds, but even if Andrei Kazimirovich's com- ments do not refer to this book in particular, the seeding of the text with un- realized science fiction clichés could point to Siniavsky's desire, as expressed in "Bez skidok," to see the genre reshaped. For instance, Andrei Kaz- imirovich frightens Leopold Sergeevich's son by claiming to drink children's blood, and when he first sees humans, he recognizes them as "intelligent crea- tures" [razumnye tvari] but fears that they will eat him (Terts 2003, 149, 155). That these details could be read as direct references back to the vampirish Wellsian Martians, which "Bez skidok" cites as the primogenitor of the cliché, coupled with the fact that they are presented as lies or false assump- tions, indicates that some of the arguments of "Bez skidok" already existed in embryonic form in 1956. As we have seen before, Siniavsky is interested in the "no-man's land" between those monstrous aliens that are hostile to Man and those perfect Adonises that resemble him in every way. Terts 's Andrei Kazimirovich, who describes himself as "neither man nor beast" [ne che- lovek, ne zver'] (Terts 2003, 154), unequivocally exists in this grey area. It is clear also from the text that Andrei Kazimirovich is well read,18 a fact that underscores the language and cultural assimilation that has erased so much of his former self. He repeatedly regrets the fact that he has been able to retain little of his native language, only the "sacred" name Pkhents, and a few phrases, all of which have lost their meaning to him. In fact, this language assimilation could serve as one possible explanation for why much of the alien's story seems so human. Just before he sets off on his final journey, he writes: Having reread my notes, I'm not pleased. In every phrase there is the influence of this alien en- vironment. Who will find this blathering in the local dialect to be of any use? I must be sure not to forget to burn them before I leave. After all, I'm not planning on showing them to the humans. And my people will not read them, they will not learn anything about me. (Terts 2003, 162) From a language perspective, then, it is an unavoidable conclusion that Andrei Kazimirovich's cultural context of mind is largely human. He is unable to per- ceive the world in terms of his native language, since he, in very real terms, has no native language. And while he has forgotten his own language almost completely, he nonetheless has a keen perception of the shortcomings of his adopted language. Andrei Kazimirovich's non-human linguistic background makes any reconciliation of these two linguistic worlds an impossibility. In- stead, his native language is killed in his mind. Yet the alien's second, domi- 18. Over the course of the story, he makes mention of Lermontov, Tolstoy, Defoe and Swift, and also references Christ, Jan Hus, Stenka Razin and Galileo.</page><page sequence="11">Imagination and Realism in Soviet Science Fiction 449 nant, language is for him an inadequate tool of communication and thought: he doubts that humans would be able to learn much from him, or that he would be able to say what would be necessary were he to reveal his identity. He writes, "how will they be able to understand me, if I can't use their language to express my non-human essence?" (Terts 2003, 156). Yet he is stuck with Russian as his language of thought and perception: his promise to himself to live his last days "without one human thought, without one word of the alien dialect" (Terts 2003, 163) will, in practice, prevent any thought at all. It should be pointed out that while many writers of science fiction circum- vent the topic of language by enabling communication via some technologi- cal or telepathic means, Terts makes language a crucial thematic point. In this way, despite the fact that the alien has learned to speak Russian, Terts 's em- phasis remains on Andrei Kazimirovich's alienness, which is relevant in terms of Siniavsky's demand for aliens that conform to alien standards. Fur- thermore, the alien's position between two linguistic worlds is crucial in order to portray the ostranenie mentioned earlier: without knowledge of earthly language and culture, he might not be able to present the human world in a way the human reader would recognize. At the same time, the fact that he re- members only a few words of his former language forces him to stand apart from his heritage. Evidence of Andrei Kazimirovich's belonging nowhere is distributed throughout the text, as the alienation conveyed when he speaks in terms of "them" and "here" is undermined by the fact that there are many as- pects of his adopted world (such as the interpersonal struggles within his communal apartment) that he seems to understand quite well. Also, in spite of his efforts to maintain a distance between the culture and the "hated and unavoidable human language" (Terts 2003, 160) he has been forced to adopt, his journal sometimes makes significant "slips." For instance, when writing about his arrival on Earth (a passage that can only be addressed to the expe- rience of a human reader), he describes his profession as that of an account- ant, which, he admits, is merely his "local," earthly profession. He writes that, "of course, it's best not to bring up the old one: we won't understand anything anyway [vse ravno nichego nepoimem]" (Terts 2003, 154) [emphasis added]. While it might have been more appropriate to say "you won't understand any- thing," Andrei Kazimirovich truthfully places himself among those who lack a basic understanding of the world he left behind. On the next page, he ex- plains his decision to leave the taiga by saying "you know yourselves what the Siberian frosts are like" (Terts 2003, 155), a direct address to the human audience he claims to disregard as a readership. Ultimately, these problems of language bring up the question of the identity of the reader. As we have seen, Andrei Kazimirovich does not want his notes, though written in Russian, to be read by humans. His own kind would not be able to read his adopted lan- guage, and thus he resolves to burn his writings, a task that, at the close of the story, has yet to be done. Of course, as can be seen from his conviction that</page><page sequence="12">450 Slavic and East European Journal Leopold Sergeevich is another of his kind, come to rescue him from Earth (another unrealized science fiction cliché), he hopes a reader among his own people might yet be found. In his 1978 book Soviet Russian Literature since Stalin, Deming Brown, referring to all of the "Fantasticheskie povesti," writes: "[h]is first-person narrators are usually engaged in confessing or com- plaining to an unspecified audience that seems either unsympathetic or un- comprehending" (337). Both these adjectives apply particularly well to the putative audience of "Pkhents": Andrei Kazimirovich's vague position be- tween Earth and his unnamed homeworld prevents both the human and the alien audiences from being either sympathetic or comprehending, neither being capable of fully identifying with his experience. At the beginning of "Bez skidok," Siniavsky cites the influential 1950 Ok- tiabr' article by Sergei Ivanov, "Fantastika i deistvitePnosf" [Science Fiction and Reality], an article that contributed to impeding the development of Soviet science fiction in the 1950s. Siniavsky claims that Ivanov's insistence on So- viet science fiction's describing only "the prospects of the most immediate (we emphasize: the most immediate) future" (Ivanov 161) is an outdated concep- tion of science fiction literature.19 Throughout "Fantastika i deistvitePnost'," Ivanov berates any and all Soviet science fiction writers who stray too far into the future or too close to the West. He praises the writer Vadim Okhotnikov (not accidentally, one of the writers who comes under Siniavsky's criticism) for staying firmly within Soviet deistvitel'nost': The far reaches of space, supernatural inventions, these are alien to the author; in his stories live and work regular Soviet scientists and inventors, whose place of work is a simple research lab- oratory, whose thoughts and actions are directed towards the invention of practical things which do not yet exist today, but tomorrow will undoubtedly be items that will be used on a daily basis. (Ivanov 160) While neither Ivanov nor Siniavsky cites it by name, the concept to which they refer has come to be known as the fantastika blizhnego pritsela, or fan- tastika na grani vozmozhnogo [respectively, "science fiction ofthat which is in our sights" and "science fiction on the edge of the possible"], which dic- tated that science fiction should portray only those possibilities which could easily be extrapolated into the near future from a given contemporary context. Ivanov's article was instrumental in defining this concept. In his 1985 survey of Soviet science fiction Vselennaia za predelom dogmy: sovetskaia nauch- naia fantastika [The Universe Beyond the Limits of Dogma: Soviet Science Fiction], Leonid Geller writes that this concept was intended to place empha- 19. That Siniavsky sustained a polemic with Ivanov's article and his limited view of litera- ture can be inferred not only from the title of the former's 1978 article "Iskusstvo i deistvitel'nost'" [Art and Reality], whose title parallels Ivanov's, but also the content: the arti- cle is a strident argument for the view that "art is higher and more meaningful than reality" (Terts 1978, 118).</page><page sequence="13">Imagination and Realism in Soviet Science Fiction 45 1 sis on the rapid development of Soviet science and technology while avoid- ing overly fantastic "flights of fancy" that were considered ideologically dis- tasteful given the strict "realist" constraints of Socialist Realism (Geller 81). The stifling effect that this policy had on the imaginations of science fiction writers was significant. Erik Simon, in his 2004 article "The Strugatskiis in Political Context," aptly states that this policy "banished the future, banished utopia, and, strictly speaking, banished the imagination itself from Soviet [science fiction]" (380). That this policy served to limit writers' imaginations not only in temporal terms is demonstrated by Martynov's biological extrap- olations in Kallisto, which can hardly be called products of a fertile imagina- tion. As Siniavsky observes, the Kallistians are shown to resemble Earthlings not only physically, but biologically, culturally, historically, etc. He writes that "for the duration of the book the author dodges the potent questions (what is life like on other planets?) that could arise in a curious reader's mind by providing laconic observations that serve as continuous confirmation of the fact that Kallisto is, in all respects, a copy of us" (Siniavskii 54). As we have already observed, both Siniavsky and Terts reject the notion of biologi- cal homogeneity throughout the Universe. "Pkhents" uses Tsiolkovsky's axiom of biological heterogeneity, invoked by Siniavsky, to create a being that is an outsider in every possible respect, and thus is able to provide a unique perspective on Soviet society. Years before the Strugatskys had per- fected their technique of placing Earthlings on distant worlds that always had Soviet parallels, Terts found an alien world without ever leaving his commu- nal apartment. What ultimately motivates Terts to employ the conventions and tropes of science fiction in his fiction? In the 1990 interview cited previously, Siniavsky states that "I don't find it interesting to write about normal subjects, if the theme is absolutely real, like the camp or anything from ordinary life, if noth- ing fantastic takes place. [...] I don't generally find it interesting to write about ordinary life" (Nepomnyashchy 1991, 6). This provides an aesthetic explana- tion for Terts 's use of science fiction and fantastic elements, but for a purely pragmatic explanation, we might consider for a moment the conclusion of Chto takoe sotsialisticheskii realizm and the famous claim that "phantas- magoric" art "would most fully correspond to the spirit of our time" (Terts 1988, 63). In "Bez skidok," while claiming that "the verisimilitude of the fan- tastic is often realized by fantastic means," Siniavsky uses an apt science fic- tion cliché: "/« order to slay a dinosaur, one needs an atomic rifle" (Siniavskii 50) [emphasis added]. Compare this with the English science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke's answer to questions of why he writes science fiction: "be- cause it is the only literature that concerns itself with reality" (Pohl ix). Clarke's comment is certainly in line with Terts 's conception of a literature that would "correspond to the spirit of our time," given the malleable "reality" of the world in which Siniavsky lived. But could it not be said that Sin-</page><page sequence="14">452 Slavic and East European Journal iavsky/Terts is here rediscovering an old truth? Even if we limit ourselves to Russian literature, it is clear that many of the most successful reflections of life as it is experienced are in the least "realistic" works: in characters as diverse as Pushkin's protean Onegin, Gogol's faceless Chichikov, Bulgakov's New Soviet Man/Dog Sharikov, and Zamiatin's passionate and robotic D-503, it can be seen that "unrealistic" literature is often the most adept at portraying real- ity. Pushkin writes in a footnote to his "Podrazheniia Koranu" [Imitations of the Koran, 1824]: "It's bad physics; but then what brave poetry!" (Pushkin 1: 326). As we have seen, Siniavsky/Terts prefers brave poetry even to good physics, since brave poetry is the poetry of an unrestrained imagination. REFERENCES Braider, Iurii, and Nikolai Chadovich.
