It is the result or expression of nature, in miniature.... Thus is Art a nature passed through the alembic of man. Thus, in art, does Nature work through the will of a man filled with the beauty of her first works. Ralph Waldo Emerson1 Flowers were just there, quietly waiting to be painted by him, in his own way. He could understand flowers better than he did landscapes, but they were for him harder to paint. Flowers were passive and defenseless, doomed to die. To him flowers meant more than what he was to himself; passing through time, receding in time, taking with them part of himself. A. P. van den Briel2 A single flower lost in a vast landscape. An unassuming painting hidden in a large powerful collection. Part of the 1958 Leonard C. Hanna, Jr., bequest to The Cleveland Museum of Art-one of the most important ever received by the Museum-the Chrysanthemum by Mondrian (Cover)3 has been overshadowed by the sheer richness of that collection. Besides four paintings by Degas, a Courbet, a Daumier, a Toulouse-Lautrec, the Hanna bequest embraced two magnificent CUzannes, two van Goghs, an early Manet, a radiant Renoir, three Picassos, three canvases by Matisse, and a fine Redon pastel. The Chrysanthemum by Mondrian who is primarily known for his geometric grid paintings-and another flower painting, Morning Glory with Black by Georgia O'Keeffe,4 seemed almost concealed among the other works. Cleveland Museum Curator Henry Francis, now retired, was not even aware that Hanna owned the Chrysanthemum, until it was discovered in one of his apartments after his death. According to Francis, who was also Hanna's friend, that Museum benefactor had probably purchased it simply because he liked it.5</page><page sequence="2">:?IT':?;:'::'P' .3:~1~1~ 1~3 l] i~i: :*. ..: . . . . .........

CMA 63.583 Piet Cornelis Mondrian (1872-1944) has long been recognized as one of the most influential artists of geometric grid abstraction. His abstract art-exemplified by Cleveland's Composition with Red, Yellow, and Blue (Figure 1)6-had such an influence on modernism that in 1952, the American abstract artist Robert Motherwell (Figure 2),7 identified the "Moral Ideal" of Abstract Expressionism as simply Mondrian.8 Actually, however, Mondrian painted more poetic flowers than austere grids, the latter only being produced during the last twenty-five years of his life. They are in turn outnumbered by the landscapes executed early in his artistic career, which account for about half of his oeuvre. Born in Holland, Mondrian-after receiving his conservative academic training at the AcadEmie in Amsterdam, which emphasized traditional Dutch floral still-life and figural compositions-began his career as an Impressionist landscape painter. Other influences on the young artist included Vincent van Gogh (1853-90), whose Dying Sunflowers are recalled in Mondrian's Dying Sunflower (Haags Gemeentemuseum) and Dying Chrysanthemum (see Figure 15). In 1892, the year Mondrian entered the Academie, a posthumous van Gogh exhibition was held in Amsterdam. That artist's life being cut short in full bloom was symbolized on the catalogue cover by a dying sunflower, surrounded by a halo, before a setting sun.9 Prominent at the Academie and throughout northern Holland during the later half of the nineteenth century were two Dutch Impressionist schools, centering on The Hague and Amsterdam, respectively. Combining the hazy atmosphere and somber mood of the Hague School with the dark coloring and "city-scape" 283</page><page sequence="3">284 subject matter of the Amsterdam Impressionists, Mondrian formed his own personal Impressionist landscape style. The Cleveland Museum of Art is fortunate in owning two of his early works, an unfettered oil landscape, Bos Oele (Figure 3),10 and an important Impressionist draw ing, Landscape at Loosduinen (Figure 4).11 This latter work was cited as being among the more orthodox examples of the Hague Impres sionists included in the exhibition, Early Works of Piet Mondrian, held at the Noah Goldowsky Gallery in 1971.12 A certain indebtedness to the Amsterdam Impressionists, however, can be seen when it is com pared with the Cleveland Museum's recent acquisition, Breaking up City Hall Street (Doorbraak Raadhuisstraat, Amsterdam) (Figure 5),13 by George Hendrik Breitner. This leading member of the Amsterdam Impressionists was admired by Mondrian during his stay in that city and has been mentioned as having a major influence on some of his early landscapes. One typical characteristic of the Amsterdam Impres sionists' work appears in both Breitner's painting and Mondrian's drawing-the individuals are set at a great distance from the viewer with an atmospheric condition, mist or twilight, blurring the details of face or figure. Toward 1908 Mondrian began to lighten his palette. Works from this period illustrate his gradual abandonment of a personal landscape style in favor of the modern French styles: Neo-lmpressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Pointillism, and Symbolism. In 1913 he took a studio in Paris and began a serious study of Cubism. Mondrian's approach to the Cubist principles of Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) and Fernand Leger (1881-1955) soon led him far from figurative allusion. By 1914, when Mondrian returned to Holland, he had already reduced landscape motifs to geometric essentials. In 1917 he wrote his aesthetic credo, calling his new style Neoplasticism, and with painter Theo van Doesburg (1883-1931) founded the De Stijl movement. Mondrian's austere white canvases, with their vertical and horizontal black lines and sparing use of primary colors, were important to the burgeoning group of nonobjective artists and also affected contemporary architecture and design. In 1938 Mondrian left Paris, where he had been living since 1919, for London, settling two years later in New York. There, he opened a new chapter in his theoretical exploration of line and color, composing works reflecting the urban rhythm of New York and its contemporary jazz scene. Finally, in Broadway Boogie Woogie dated 1942-43 (Museum of Modern Art, New York) and Victory Boogie Woogie of 1943-44 (The National Gallery of Art, Washington), he eliminated the archetypal black lines, replacing them with wide lines composed of rectangles of pure color, while excluding larger, colored rectangles. In these paintings he referred not only to his experience of New York street patterns, but to his delight in the jazz records that he played over</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3.

Of Broadway Boogie Woogie, John Russell has commented: All of New York is in this painting, if we know how to look for it. As to the question Why are there no great paintings of New York? it no longer needed to be asked. 14 Mondrian exhibited with the group known as American Abstract Artists and had one-man exhibitions at the Valentine Dudensing Gallery. As usual, he lived and worked alone, but attracted a group of artists including Harry Holtzman, Fritz Glarner (Figure 6),15 Charmion von Wiegand (Figure 7),16 and Carl Holty among others. On February 1, 1944, at the age of 71, Mondrian died from pneumonia. Agreeing with Paul Cezanne (1839-1906)-who said, "Everything, especially in art, is theory developed and applied with nature"17 Mondrian devoted his life to a theory of art in which particular forms of nature were gradually abolished to reveal pure relationships. In Cezanne's watercolors for the first time associations completely independent of the objects depicted were created.18 In a new historical context, but in a continuing tradition, the same statement could be applied to Mondrian. It was in such works as Cleveland's classic painting (Figure 1) that Mondrian realized his goal of an "abstract real"19 art, one released from all naturalistic representation. Even after Mondrian had abandoned all specific allusions to natural detail, however, he did not surrender his devotion to the single flower, which he painted as late as 1938 in London. Theorizing about his "abstract-real" art, Mondrian wrote: A closed form, such as a flower, says something other than an open curved line, as in the dune; and something else again than the straight line of a church or the radiating petals of some other flower. By com paring, you see that a particular form makes a particular impression ....20</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7. Power Plant II, oil on canvas, 50.9 x 61 cm., 1949. Charmion von Wiegand, American, 1900-83. Dorothea Wright Hamilton Fund. CMA 82.178 If the open curved line expresses extension and vastness, the closed form in contrast would suggest inwardness and containment. Form was reduced to line, and like a scientist, Mondrian explored inner relation ships and believed in space and intersection. As Honore de Balzac, has expressed it: The curve is the law of the material worlds and the straight line that of the spiritual; the one is the theory of finite creation, the other is the theory of the infinite.21 Like Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944), Mondrian proceeded from "inner necessity" toward a spiritual world. He believed this compulsion resulted in a meaningful creation emerging through a correct compre hension of the primeval evolution of Matter (curve) and Spirit (line). At this point, however, a dualism was still operating. While Mondrian sought the equilibrium of opposites (i.e., the pure relationship), he had to explore the curved line (the material and the feminine) as well as the straight line (the spiritual and the masculine). All curved lines by implication were relegated to the status of capricious natural forms. Carrying the idea further in his sketchbooks, he defined the idea that the straight vertical line represented the masculine, as seen in the trunk of the tree, while the horizontal portrayed the feminine, as seen in the line separating sea and sky.22 When Charmion von Wiegand told Mondrian that his was an art only for men, he responded, Oh no, you are mistaken. The vertical is masculine, the horizontal feminine-all through the ages.23 287</page><page sequence="7">Figure 8. Chez Mondrian, gelatin silver print, 25.4 x 20.3 cm., signed and dated on back: A. Kertez 1926. Andre KertLsz, American (b. Hungary), 1894-1985. James Parmelee Fund. CMA 80.34 In his Paris studio, Mondrian kept an imitation flower with its leaves painted white. The single blossom was immortalized by Andr6 Kertesz in his well-known portrait, Chez Mondrian (Figure 8).24 In the indepen dent medium of photography, Kertesz crystallized aspects of Mondrian's daily life and environment that can be seen as reflecting what he was about as an artist.25 Mondrian told a visitor about this flower, "I wanted something to symbolize the grace and loveliness of a woman."26 Michel Seuphor's description of Mondrian's Paris studio in the 1920s could equally well describe Cleveland's classic Composition: The white walls were decorated with horizontal and vertical lines, enclosing color planes in pure red, yellow and black. The floor was treated in the same way and the plain kitchen table was painted white, with a red drawer.27 Outside of his rectilinear surroundings, there was one exception-the single flower. Generally, the flower can be referred to as the "feminine ideal" in his austerely intellectual life. Of this feminine ideal, his close friend, the forester Albert van den Briel, has written: I sometimes had the impression that cultivated flowers (not the wild ones) was [sic] to him a link to the image of a childish young girl, yet woman. A phenomenon in life which never ceased to have a great attraction for Mondrian, but the simpler the better.28 Widely sought after as collector's items, Mondrian's flower paintings are now recognized as an important group of works in understanding the artist and his resolution of opposing forces toward achieving his goal of pure abstract art. Van den Briel has said that those paintings "reflect much of Mondrian's inner life, as an individual and as a painter."29 Cleveland's example (Cover) is one of Mondrian's most unusual flower paintings. Strikingly different from his other chrysanthemums in color and painterly technique, and unlike many of the more than 250 flowers in Mondrian's oeuvre-most of which are chrysanthemums this painting has no known related works or copies. Exhibiting both painterly brush work and linear qualities, it is a small oil study of a flat tened, frontal image. Although sketchily painted like many of Mondrian's early works, including the landscape in the Cleveland col lection, it has a strong linear quality as seen in the agitated blue line of the petals. In contrast to the forceful line is the misty "oil-wash" treatment of the flower, which is also found in a Mondrian sunflower study of 1909.30 The painterly brush work is evident in the short but wide thick strokes that invade the ground. Surrounded by an astral shell and placed in a reddish-ochre ground, the ochre flower is highlighted with yellow</page><page sequence="8">Figure 9. White Flower, oil on canvas, 76.5 x 91.8 cm., 1929.

The stem of the flower extends vertically up the center of the painting, pushing the blossom to the edge of the confining canvas, thus giving it a monumental effect that anticipates floral works of Post Abstract Expressionist artists, such as Georgia O'Keeffe (Figure 9).31 It is unclear why Mondrian singled out the chrysanthemum as his subject. In regard to his search for the inherent character of things, he wrote retrospectively: From an early date, I enjoyed painting flowers, not bouquets, but a single flower at a time, in order that I might better express its plastic structure... 32 Mondrian's preference for the complex structure of the many-petaled chrysanthemum is best realized with his description of another flower, which he never attempted to paint, the white orchid: "that is only line."33 Martin James has suggested that Mondrian's choice of the chrysanthemum may have overtones of human mortality-which can be associated with the Dying Chrysanthemum (see Figure 15)-as found in the literary Symbolist tradition, for example, in the essays of the Belgium poet and dramatist, Maurice-Polydore-Marie-Bernard Maeterlinck.34 Although the concept of mortality is certainly associated with the Dying Chrysanthemum, this connotation would hardly have been appropriate for other works, such as the Chrysanthemum he gave to Queen Wilhelminia of the Netherlands on the occasion of her marriage (see Figure 12).35 When viewing Cleveland's Chrysanthemum in 1981, the Dutch Mondrian scholar Joop Joosten questioned its 1906 date. He suggested that it might have been done twenty years later during a period of commercially inspired works.36 Mondrian's best-known flowers-the Expressionist Chrysanthemum (see Figure 16) and its related work, Dying Chrysanthemum (see Figure 15)-were painted about the same time as that ascribed to the Cleveland Chrysanthemum. The flatness of the 289</page><page sequence="9">290 Cleveland flower with its placement in the picture plane, however, is unlike the volumetric works in The Hague, which have known pro venances and what are considered to be reasonable dates.37 If, therefore, the latter are typical stylistically of the works for the period 1906-14, it seems logical to consider whether the Cleveland painting could have been done at a time other than the year 1906, the date painted on the canvas. Determining the importance and the signifi cance of this flower hinge on establishing its date. The Cleveland Chrysanthemum was purchased from the Valentine Dudensing Gallery in 1947, three years after Mondrian's death. In the checklist for the Mondrian exhibition held at that gallery in 1942, there are three untitled, undescribed paintings from 1906. It is quite possible that the Cleveland flower, signed P M and dated 1906, was one of them or, at least, that it was among the several paintings that Mondrian dated 1906 collectively when he gave them to Dudensing. It was common practice in the artistic milieu of late nineteenth-century Amsterdam to leave such sketches unfinished until a patron for the final version was found. The production of such "finished" works for a patron was usual for that time in Amsterdam, and the distinction between sketches and final version continued to be observed by Mondrian, even during his abstract periods. Since its provenance is not conclusive for dating purposes, a stylistic comparison of the Cleveland Chrysanthemum with selected flowers seems the best course available for establishing a probable date for the painting. To summarize the development of Mondrian's flower image-in particular, the chrysanthemum-his flower works can be divided into four periods: I. Bouquet of Volumetric Flowers (ca. 1897), II. Flat, Frontal Flower (ca. 1900), III. Expressionist Flower (1906-14), and IV. Traced, Flat Frontal Flower (ca. 1920s). Alternative methods of dating were also explored. The Cleveland painting was examined by the Museum's Conservation Department, and leading Mondrian scholars and friends-such as art historian Robert Welsh, artist Harry Holtzman, and New York art dealer Sidney Janis-were consulted.38</page><page sequence="10">Figure 10.

Bouquet of Volumetric Flowers The earliest flower studies, appearing in the late 1890s following Mondrian's graduation from the Academie in Amsterdam, are bouquets of three to five volumetric chrysanthemums. Compositionally in shape, scale, and general design, his still-life paintings, such as Bowl with Five Chrysanthemums (Figure 10), recall the traditional Dutch seventeenth century still lifes of Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder (Figure 11 ).39 Unlike Bosschaert's mixed bouquets of a variety of flowers, however, Mondrian's follow the nineteenth-century tradition of van Gogh and his Dutch contemporaries in depicting a small bouquet of the same flower. The works bring to mind similar chrysanthemum bouquets by such mid-nineteenth century French artists as Claude Monet (1840 1926), Edouard Manet (1832-83), and Camille Pissarro (1830-1903). The individual blossoms presage Mondrian's isolated flower studies. Likewise, his predilection for an isolated motif is seen in his contempo rary Impressionist landscapes featuring a single tree silhouetted on a broad horizon (see Figure 19). Among flower subjects, however, Mondrian seems to have painted only the chrysanthemum during this period, and it remained the most popular flower motif in his oeuvre. - - rt9~~l~ r ! ~ 291</page><page sequence="11">292 ; i I c * ,. ?.7?

Flat, Frontal Flower Painted at the turn of the century, the second group of flowers con centrates on isolated blossoms, defined with descriptive detail and an emphasis on structural design in a frontal flattened-out format (Figure 12). Removed from a prosaic environment, the flower is most often set in a ground of vertical fluid washes. The two-dimensional quality recalls Japanese prints of stylized chrysanthemums (Figure 13), and it seems quite possible that Mondrian, as van Gogh before him, was inspired by such renderings in Japanese art.40 However, the flattening of the frontal blossom-specifically, the linear detail of the petals is stylistically reminiscent of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century, botanical drawings (Figure 14), many of which were drawn to show the interior pattern of the flower. Mondrian has written, at twenty-two began a very difficult time for me. To make a living I did many kinds of work-... drawings for textbooks and schoolrooms ....41 Mondrian's brother, Carel, remembers him as a young boy studying perspective, the structure of flowers and plants, and anatomy.42 T???-?i. -i.

Expressionist Flower Mondrian did many unique flowers during the years 1906-14, a crucial transitional period in his career, characterized by intensive research in various and often diametrically opposed directions. For the first time, many flowers other than chrysanthemums were conceived in different styles; for example, Cattail, ca. 1909, Art Nouveau; Tigerlily, ca. 1909-10, Pointillist; and Amaryllis, 1910, Fauvist. The Dying Chrysan themum (Figure 15) and several related works (Figure 16) painted with a direct flowing brush technique form a group of Symbolist flowers that can be shown to date from the years 1907-08. James Sweeney has delineated the anthropomorphic qualities of this dying flower: The flower was like a ghostly corpse in silhouette... withered, with green leaves hanging down like the bony arms of a skeleton.43 Sharing the fluid contours, the drooping leaves, and the astral effect created by the curving brush strokes that encase the flowers, these works express Mondrian's interest in Theosophy.44The halo can be interpreted as an artistic re-creation of the flower's astral shell. Theo sophical doctrine states that, as the material body of the plant decays, its astral, or supersensible, substance survives. Plant forms, especially flower blossoms, like human and animal bodies, may be said to recapitulate in microcosm the eternal cycle of birth, reproduction, decay, material death, and regeneration that Theosophy sees as the ruling principle of the universe. reaitlt in.J mircs h tra yl fbrh erdcin deay maeia deth andregnertio tht Teosphyseeasth 293</page><page sequence="13">294 i? :::'r::~~~~:::~~~~:~~; Il- I I- -----~~~~rs::;?.?.. ?? ? ?~~. : .:.:: .. . .. . . . .....

In his autobiographical essay of 1942, "Toward a True Vision of Reality," he noted: The first thing to change in my painting was the color. I forsook natural color for pure color. I had come to feel that the colors of nature cannot be reproduced on canvas. Instinctively, I felt that painting had to find a new way to express the beauty of nature.45 Two other classic examples from this period were done in charcoal (Figures 17 and 18), a medium that combines precisely drawn contours with painterly effect of shading. The form of the "rag-doll" Chrysan themum (Figure 17) bears similarities to that found in his many studies of a tree-for example, The Isolated Tree (Figure 19) of the same time-while the expressive agitated nature of the Guggenheim flower (Figure 18) is repeated in The Red Tree of 1908 (Figure 20). drian.

Traced, Flat, Frontal Flower The later flower works produced by Mondrian in the 1920s were mainly commercially inspired watercolors. After the lean years of 1921 and 1922, when Mondrian was about to abandon art altogether,46 he discovered a steady source of income in producing flowers on commis sion. Of these paintings, the French photographer Brassa' said to the American artist and Mondrian's friend Carl Holty: "And to think Mondrian has to do botanical and scientific drawings just to keep alive."47 In these late traced flowers (Figure 21), the cool unified coloring of the blossoms destroys the classic opposition between figure and ground. Their soft shading and tinted blue and rose coloring show the sensitivity to natural beauty with which he executed these final remembrances of the flower motif. NZi~ L"nau 5%,.emn ?

However, with the increased interest in collecting them, a few flower works signed in script, Piet Mondrian London-period, have appeared in sales catalogues. In these later works, the outline of the flower has disappeared. The soft shading of the thin watercolor wash has been replaced with areas of thickly painted flat color with heavy brush work. Lost is the delicate touch so beautifully illustrated in The Hague's Chrysanthemum (Figure 16) and even in the Guggenheim watercolor from the 1920s (Figure 21). Stylistic analogies with the first and second flower periods determine that the Cleveland Museum's Chrysanthemum was not produced dur ing these periods.48 It is demonstrably neither a naturalistic flower nor part of a bouquet as produced during the first period, 1898. Although the flattened, frontal image is similar to the flowers of the second period, the brush work-particularly in the background-does not correspond to the long fluid strokes of the flowers painted in the early years of the century. Such brush work does not appear in Mondrian's work until after 1908 and is seen first in some of the early works of the period 1906-14. Joop Joosten has suggested that it might have been done during the 1920s. In 1981, he wrote: I wondered if it might not have been made in the 1920s, in the time Mondrian painted his series of flowers to sell. The frontality of the flower, the placing of it in the plane, and the subdued colours, are features which do not fit in the first decade of this century, I feel. In my opinion they are more related to the later water-coloured drawings.49 However, even though the frontality of the flower and the placing of it in the plane correspond stylistically with the 1920s flowers, other evidence suggests that it was painted at another time. According to Sidney Janis, the flowers created in the period 1920-26 have back grounds that are either white or white with a blue tinge. Further analogies indicate that the linear descriptive detail and emphasis on outline of the Cleveland Chrysanthemum do not compare with the planar petals and slight hint of outline in the flowers of the 1920s. The heavy brush work, the descriptive detail of the petals, the structural emphasis, and the strong outline of the Cleveland Chrysanthemum are not characteristic of the works of the 1920s. There do appear to be similarities between the Cleveland Chrysanthe mum and the group of flowers produced in England during the 1930s. In these few works signed London-period, the heavily brushed appearance of both the background and flower does seem to correspond with the similar treatment of paint in the Cleveland flower. Again, however, the linear detail and heavily outlined, agitated petals of the Cleveland flower do not have parallel features in these London flowers. Like the flowers done in the 1920s, these 1930s flowers indicate the artist's interest in planar petals. Therefore, it seems highly unlikely that the Cleveland Chrysanthemum was done in 1938, during Mondrian's stay in London. 297</page><page sequence="17">298 Figure 22. Chrysanthemum, oil, 40.7 x 29.9 cm., ca. 1910. Mondrian. Collection unknown. (Photo credit: Courtesy of E. V. Thaw &amp; Co., New York) A closer examination of the third period of flowers 1906-14 suggests that this Chrysanthemum belongs to that important group of works. Although the unique Cleveland Chrysanthemum does not compare stylistically with the well-known volumetric works in The Hague of this period, the combination of its image, its placement in the picture plane, and its agitated linear appearance do correspond to other works of this date-in particular to the image of the Red Tree. Similarities are also seen with later flower paintings, such as the Guggenheim flower. Most important, however, the astral effect of the blossom with its Theosophical implications appears only in the flowers of this period. Further analysis shows that the heavy outline and descriptive detail with overall feeling of "motion" (as Kenneth Ball has written descrip tively of the Guggenheim flower of this time)50 is similar in both these works. The ochre paint of the flower is applied like an "oil-wash" which is the same treatment Mondrian gave Sunflower II, which dates to ca. 1909.51 According to Welsh, the ochre color, also used in other Cubist works of this time, was probably the result of an experience Mondrian had had at the time.52 Like the E. V. Thaw Chrysanthemum (Figure 22), which uses the same obvious heavy brush work, this work was a varia tion. The definitive argument for placing Cleveland's work in this period is supplied by Welsh: If Mondrian signed it 1906, he felt it was done around that time. With other works misdated by two years which Mondrian signed and dated in New York, it seems safe to say ca. 1908-09 for this painting.53</page><page sequence="18">Joosten and Holtzman have agreed about Mondrian's mis-dating. Joosten has also suggested, in correspondence dated 1983, that the Cleveland work might have been mis-dated by Mondrian in New York: It is possible that Mondrian brought the painting himself to New York in 1940 without a signature and date, and that he initialed and dated it there. We know paintings from earlier periods which he brought to New York unsigned and undated, and which he gave them a wrong, i.e., earlier date.54 That the Cleveland flower was signed and dated by Mondrian in New York was verified by Holtzman: That's his New York signature. It is quite obvious Mondrian signed and dated the painting when he gave it to Dudensing.55 Signing and dating works when he presented them to other people was Mondrian's practice. Although Holtzman had seen Mondrian sign "some of the Chrysanthemum series"56 in New York, he would not commit himself to having seen Mondrian sign this particular flower. Mondrian mis-dated many of his works by a few years because he erred in recollecting 1910 as the year of his move to Paris. His practice of back dating is easy to verify. In 1912, after arriving in Paris, he used but one "a" in his name, changing it from the Dutch spelling to the French; but there are drawings signed Mondrian with the dates of 1906-09. Complicating this even further, he continued to use the Dutch spelling, Mondriaan, on commissioned works sent back to the Netherlands from Paris so that this signature does not necessarily mean a pre-1912 date. Seuphor was the first to question exactly when Mondrian arrived in Paris. At the end of his life, Mondrian maintained, in Toward the True Vision of Reality (1942), that he had come to Paris "around 1910."57 Seuphor has shown, and other historians agree, that the accurate date is 1912.58 With other works misdated by two years-ones that Mondrian signed and dated in New York- it seems safe to say ca. 1908-09 for the Cleveland Chrysanthemum, signed P M and dated 1906. It fits in stylistically with the work done during what Mondrian called his "Blue Tree Period."59 Paintings from these years illustrate the transition in Mondrian's development from his Expressionist works of 1906-08 to his early Cubist works of 1913-14. The artist brought examples of that period with him to New York because he felt they were important in showing his development toward Cubism.60 299</page><page sequence="19">300 In an effort to determine if the date and signature had been added some forty years after the work was supposedly executed, the painting especially the signature and date-was examined by the Museum's Conservation Department in 1983. Although there appeared to be some discrepancy between the signature and date, no conclusive evidence of when they had been added was discovered. While examining the surface, the Curator of Modern Art, Edward B. Henning, suggested that the reddish-ochre overpaint of the background might possibly have been added later than the rest. A 1975 conservation report characterizes the condition of the painting as: Slight, old (artist-induced) abrasion to paint/ground (tops of threads). Film has been scraped down with palette knife after application.6' This seems consistent with Mondrian's habit of scraping, erasing and reworking earlier paintings. Mondrian continued to paint the flower throughout his career, even after the forms of all his other motifs were reduced to pure "inner relationships." Generally, the flower may be referred to as the "feminine ideal" in his otherwise rectilinear world, or as the fulfillment of an inner need. It can, indeed, be said of these paintings that, "They reflect much of Mondrian's inner life, as an individual and a painter."62 Jane Neet</page><page sequence="20">This article was developed from the author's master's thesis, Case Western Reserve University, June 1985.

Originating in the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart and traveling to the Haags Gemeentemuseum and the Balti more Museum of Art, 1981, this show included the flower works from the Haags Gemeentemuseum mentioned in the article. 37. The flowers in the Haags Gemeente museum are from the collection of S. B. Slijper, a long-time personal friend of Mondrian's. This collection, containing some of his most important flower pieces, has been dated and documented by Mondrian scholars, and the dates are considered correct. 38. Robert Welsh wrote his dissertation on Mondrian's early "Naturalistic Period," in 1965, and has contributed to the major Mondrian exhibitions at the Toronto Mu seum in 1966; at the Solomon R. Guggen heim Museum in 1972; and at the Haags Gemeentemuseum and the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1981. Harry Holtzman, as a young artist, met Mondrian in Paris during the 1930s. Along with the American artist, Carl Holty, he continued to be a close friend and associate of Mondrian's after his move to New York. Sidney Janis went to Mondrian's studio in Paris in 1932, purchasing his first Mondrian painting, Composition of 1933, in 1933. This painting was included in the commissioned work of the American sculptor George Segal, Portrait of Sidney Janis with Mondrian Painting 1967. It is one of Janis's favorite paintings in his collection. He continued to purchase Mondrian works and has shown this artist's works frequently in his gallery. 39.
