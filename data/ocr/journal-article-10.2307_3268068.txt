As Peter Kuhn demon- strates in Offenbarungsstimmen im Antiken Judentum, the revelatory voice is found throughout Second Temple literature, and he cites dozens of examples from late biblical sources, apocalyptic literature, Jubilees, targums, Hellenistic Jewish authors, and the rabbinic bat qol.2 The present study argues that the concept of a mediating, hypostatic voice (Cp) exists in earlier strata of the Hebrew Bible as well.2 The term "hypostatic" is problematic. S. Dean McBride defines "hyposta- sis" as "a quality, epithet, attribute, manifestation or the like of a deity which through a process of personification and differentiation has become a distinct (if not fully independent) divine being in its own right,"3 a definition adopted in A number of scholars generously read earlier drafts of this study and provided me with very helpful comments.

To these should be added examples from the NT (e.g., Mark 1:11 and parallels), and see also the interesting discussion of Ben Sira 17:13 by Anthony Hanson, "LXX Treatment of the Theme of Seeing God," in Septu- agint, Scrolls, and Cognate Writings: Papers Presented to the International Symposium on the Sep- tuagint and Its Relations to the Dead Sea Scrolls and Other Writings (ed.

In addition, the terms "intermediary" and "mediating" are used interchangeably with "hypostatic," since they express the independence of the entity in question from God. There are different shades of meaning to these terms, but the biblical sources do not allow for more precise semantic differen- tiation, an ambiguity endemic to analysis of biblical hypostases (most notably Wisdom).4 Rather than assay a complete and adequate definition, it is hoped the biblical passages in question and the subsequent analysis convey the hypo- static nature of1p1. My argument is limited in scope. The word 1ip does not regularly refer to a mediating entity; in fact these instances are rare. There are, however, a num- ber of passages in Ezekiel, Numbers, and the account of the Sinai theophany that suggest the presence of a hypostatic voice. The MT of these passages is often corrupt in ways that obscure the hypostatic nature or even the very exis- tence of the voice-arguably the result of a theologically motivated late edi- tor-so certainty is not possible. The argument consists of two parts: first, analysis of the three verses that contain the hitpacel form of 17, followed by a discussion of the Sinai/Horeb theophany. We begin with Num 7:89. I. The Hitpacel 171 and the Fragmentary Nature of Numbers 7:89 Numbers 7:89 involves a number of difficulties: And when Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the cover of the ark that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim, saying to him ... .5 One problem is the vocalization "~"7', a hitpacel participle instead of the more common picel vocalization. The curious vocalization has elicited different explanations from both ancient and modern commentators. Abraham Ibn Ezra argues in his commentary on this verse that "1:7P is not a hitpacel participle but an infinitive construct with a prefixed prepositional r (= ir). This suggestion, 4On Wisdom, see Bernhard Lang, Wisdom and the Book of Proverbs: An Israelite Goddess Redefined (New York: Pilgrim, 1986); Lang rejects the notion of Wisdom as hypostasis (pp. 137-46), though the title of the book suggests that Wisdom was once much more than that. Claudia V. Camp also rejects the view that Wisdom is a hypostasis (Wisdom and the Feminine in the Book of Proverbs [Sheffield: Almond, 1985], 34-37), but later in the study embraces the notion that "Wis- dom, who was begotten before creation and was present with God during creation, is also the primary link between God and humankind" (p. 272). Much depends, it seems, on how one under- stands the term "hypostasis." 5 Unless otherwise noted, all translations are my own.</page><page sequence="3">Yadin: ?ip as Hypostasis in the Hebrew Bible 603 however, fits poorly with the sense of the verse in Numbers. The r of 77 n in Num 7:89 cannot be prepositional, since Moses is hearing speech-the speaker is "1:7n with Moses-not addressing the act of speech as Ibn Ezra's reading requires. Rashi argues that the hitpacel is a reverential form that suggests that God was both the speaker and the audience of the speech. Martin Noth, con- sciously or not, follows Rashi in arguing that the hitpacel participle indicates that the voice "speaks with itself," adding parenthetically, "this is certainly the meaning of the text in the traditional vocalization." The problem with Noth's (and Rashi's) reading is that it does not explain why this verse employs the rev- erential hitpacel to represent God's speech, while innumerable verses use the (irreverent?) picel, including T'? N2171 at the end of the verse. Baruch Levine argues that the hitpacel participle has an iterative force and should be rendered "He continuously spoke."' This reading, while possible, lacks contextual sup- port, since the broader context provides no indication that the speech described in Num 7:89 was any more or less continuous than other divine speeches. Indeed, the attempt to ascertain the meaning of the hitpacel from the broader context of the passage leads to a second difficulty confronting the interpreter of Num 7:89, namely, that the verse is essentially without context. Numbers 7:89 is the concluding verse of ch. 7, which describes the gifts the tribal chieftains bring as part of the dedication of the tabernacle. The phys- ical setting of the narrative-the tabernacle-is carried over into v. 89, but the theme of God's revelation to Moses constitutes a thematic break with what pre- cedes it. The final words of v. 89-1rTh 1:r ("saying to him")-require that what follows be the content of the divine communication. Instead one finds a second introductory formula (Num 8:1) preceding God's instructions regarding the construction of the lampstand. The result-"And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him ... saying to him. And the Lord spoke to Moses saying: Speak to Aaron and tell him -..."is an impossible juxtaposition of one introductory statement leading to another. Numbers 7:89 is isolated both from what precedes and from what follows it and is rightly characterized by A. H. McNeile as "an isolated and mutilated fragment." Without context it is impossible to determine which if any of the grammatical explanations offered for the MT vocalization of M-rzn is appropri- ate. McNeile himself tries to explain the fragmentary nature of Num 7:89 as "a single incident introducing some words of Jehovah which have been lost."8 But 6 Martin Noth, Numbers: A Commentary (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968), 65.

These difficulties led Jacob Milgrom candidly to admit that "[w]hy the Masoretes pointed [=tMra] as a Hitpael partici- ple is not clear."9 A source that has been overlooked in the analysis of Num 7:89 is the Sifre Numbers, the legal midrash redacted in the third century but containing tradi- tions attributed to sages of the second.10 I have devoted a separate study to the Sifre Numbers' interpretation of Num 7:89 and will not rehearse the argument here, except to say that the Sifre Numbers' gloss of Num 7:89 draws the reader's attention to the fact that God is not mentioned in the verse.11 At first sight this comment appears meaningless, since God-though not mentioned by name- is obviously the one speaking to Moses, and there is a venerable tradition of translators and commentators "introducing" God into the verse. One of two methods is typically employed. Either one substitutes "God's voice" for MT "the voice," as when LXX has Moses hearing "tilv 0oviv Kupioi 'Lakovtre;," and Noth refers to "the voice (sc. of God)"; or one makes God the explicit object of the Hebrew InKr. The NRSV has, "And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with the Lord"; Philip J. Budd parenthetically glosses, "And when Moses entered the Tent of Meeting to speak with him (Yahweh) ..."; and La Sainte Bible translates: "Quand Moise penetrait dans la Tente de Reunion pour s'adresser t Lui"-capitalizing the pronoun to indicate that it refers to God.12 Numbers 7:89 does not support either approach. First, the verse states that Moses heard the voice, not "God" or "God's voice." Second, the isolated and discontinuous nature of the verse undermines any attempt to determine the referent of nrt. God is not mentioned in the description of the chieftains' gifts; one must return to Num 7:11--almost eighty verses earlier-to find men- tion of God. The assumption that rin refers to God, though prima facie reason- able, is motivated by theology, not grammar. The Sifre Numbers picks up on the absence of explicit mention of God and 9 Jacob Milgrom, The JPS Torah Commentary: Numbers (Philadelphia/Jerusalem: Jewish Publication Society, 1990), 305 n. 22. 10 On the Sifre Numbers, see H. L. Strack and Giinter Stemberger, Introduction to the Tal- mud and Midrash (trans. and ed. Markus Bockmuehl; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996), 266-68. The passage in question is Sifre Numbers ?58, pp. 55-66 in the Horovitz edition. 11 See Azzan Yadin, "Shnei Ketuvim and Rabbinic Intermediation," JSJ 33 (2002): 386-410. The biblical analysis does not depend on the rabbinic interpretation in any way. I present the rab- binic material as a way to emphasize how much rabbinic interpretation has to offer biblical scholar- ship, and to protest the gulf that often separates rabbinics from biblical scholarship. 12 Noth, Numbers, 65; Philip J. Budd, Numbers (WBC 5; Waco: Word, 1984), 85; La Sainte Bible, translated under the direction of l'Icole biblique de J6rusalem (Paris: Cerf, 1961), 146.</page><page sequence="5">Yadin: ?1p as Hypostasis in the Hebrew Bible 605 suggests that it is "the voice" that speaks in the tent of meeting, not God: "Scripture relates that Moses would enter into the Tent of Meeting and stand there, and the voice descended from highest heavens to between the Cherubs, and he heard the voice speaking to him from within" (Sifre Numbers ?58 [Horovitz ed., 55]). According to the Sifre Numbers, the voice regularly resides in the highest heavens but descends from its heavenly abode to speak with Moses within the tent.13 In other words, the Sifre Numbers interprets Num 7:89 as a theological statement to the effect that a hypostatic voice lowers itself from the heavens to communicate with Moses while God remains divorced from human affairs. Bracketing the theological ramifications of this interpreta- tion for the understanding of rabbinic Judaism, we see that the intermediary voice reading clarifies, at least partially, the two major difficulties outlined above. 1. The lack of context of Num 7:89: God's location at the time of revelation is a contested issue within the Bible. If Num 7:89 does introduce a mediating voice, the discontinuity of the verse may be an attempt to introduce a polemic theological position in an inconspicuous manner. On this reading, the lack of clear antecedent for the pronoun inr is not an accidental ambiguity but a smokescreen that allows the reader to assume that the referent is God. In this way the new position is introduced but its novelty is camouflaged, a dynamic well known in biblical literature from Deuteronomy.14 I refer to Noth's obser- vation that Num 7:89 is "phrased, perhaps intentionally, in a very mysterious way" and that the "strange wording . . . suggests [the verse] is intended as an independent statement and not simply as the introduction to a divine address."'" The mediating-voice interpretation of the verse provides such an 13 With this interpretation, the Sifre Numbers takes a clear stand on an issue that has occu- pied modern critics, siding, as it were, with Gerhard von Rad ("The Tent and the Ark," in The Prob- lent of the Hexateuch and Other Essays [Edinburgh/London: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1965], 105-6) in holding that the meeting does not entail a permanent residence of the divine in the tent. See also Manfred G6rg's assertion that "i=7 meint hier wie auch sonst bei P ein kurzzeitiges Verweilen" (Girg, Das Zelt der Begegnung [BBB 27; Bonn: Peter Hanstein, 1967], 60). Israel Knohl rejects this position, arguing that the priestly Torah accepts God's permanent presence in the tent of meet- ing (though the Holiness School does not); see Knohl, The Sanctuanj of Silence: The Priestly Torah and the Holiness School (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995), 131. For a survey of the different opinions regarding this issue, see Tryggve N. D. Mettinger, The Dethronement of Sabaoth: Studies in the Shemn and 7 1 Theologies (Lund: Gleerup, 1982), 84; and, more recently, Benjamin D.

The MT vocalization of 1~n: The Sifre Numbers does not cite any spe- cific textual difficulty as generating its exegesis, but there can be little doubt that the unusual vocalization caught the eye of the rabbinic exegete. The medi- ating voice speaking to Moses from the tent of meeting offers a possible expla- nation by allowing the hitpa'el to be understood as a reflexive form. The argument is not central enough to warrant an extended discussion of the vari- ous meanings of the hitpa'el, but consider, by way of illustration, 7)1, a root that-like ~~l-is regularly found in the pi'el. Just as v7rn means "to sanctify oneself, to cause oneself to be holy,"'16 .-, could suggest "causing oneself to speak" or "speaking by one's own agency." This is not the only or even the most obvious meaning of the hitpa'el, but if Num 7:89 refers to a mediating voice, the curious form might emphasize the agency of the voice and thus its indepen- dence from God. This interpretation of the hitpa'el would be strengthened if the same form were found in other passages referring to a mediating voice. This is as far as Num 7:89 will take us. The interpretation offered by the Sifre Numbers is suggestive, but the brevity and fragmentary nature of Num 7:89 render any interpretation speculative. The rabbinic reading does, how- ever, point the way for further inquiry. If there is a relationship between the hitpacel vocalization of -InI and a theology of mediation, the connection might present itself more clearly in other contexts. There are only two other instances of -.'1T, both in Ezekiel. II. The Hitpacel 17 in Ezekiel Ezekiel 43:6 Ezekiel 43:6 is part of the temple restoration program. Ezekiel has been transported to the Land of Israel, where he sees a heavenly entity, a man "whose appearance was like bronze" (Ezek 40:3). The man guides Ezekiel through the restored temple, measuring its dimensions and moving from gate to gate. When they reach the eastern gate, Ezekiel has the following vision (Ezek 43:1-6): tc ~ TE 7n::- M-7 2 V'7P7 7-17 ME -10 ? -1= -1=77 ?tk 7 1 M nmnrn rM n7= 3 77:1= 71"K 7rI c:=lM I:rn t7n K7= M, ?Ii:* ; -r77 iil t?-= Mlt?-V 7.U7 Mt?

And I heard speaking [middabber] to me out of the temple, though [the] man had been'8 standing beside me. The first issue to be addressed is the identity of the speaker, a difficult question since Mn':l, '8 "'_ nPvrD 1 ("And I heard speaking to me out of the temple") has no apparent subject. The hitpacel participle can be nominal, in which case middabbir would refer to the speaker addressing Ezekiel, and this is how most translations render it.19 This translation is awkward, however, since the partici- ple appears in the phrase no,-n b1 :n, which implies that the prophet hears speech (not a speaker) issuing from the temple. Though "one who speaks to me from the temple" is not ungrammatical, it is awkward, since the participle func- tions both nominally and verbally. If the participle is nominal the verse ought to provide an independent verb (e.g., "I heard a speaker call to me from the tem- ple"); if verbal, there should be an independent subject (e.g., "I heard a man speak to me from the temple"). The latter possibility is attested in the LXX of v. 6, which explicitly identi- fies the speaker as a voice: Kai icotrlv i i6a. ~ovtil 0Vl e t o otioKu aooivro; 7rp6; ge ("and I arose and behold a voice from within the temple of one speak- ing to me"). According to the LXX, Ezekiel heard the voice of one speaking (0ov~l Xao6vroq) from the temple. In this manner, the LXX provides the speaking subject not found in v. 6 of the MT. Usually the smoothness of the LXX would be explained as an exegetical plus that serves to resolve the difficult 17 Both these visions-one on the River Chebar and one prophesying the destruction of Jerusalem-are discussed below. 18 The pluperfect "'%; " i~,7 7'V1 emphasizes that the human figure was standing beside Ezekiel all along and was not the speaker. On this formn, see Ziony Zevit, The Anterior Construction in Classical Hebrew (SBLMS 50; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1998). 19 KJV: "And I heard him speaking to me"; NRSV: "I heard someone speaking to me"; Vul- gate: "Et audivi loquentem ad me de domo"; Luther: "Und ich h6rete einen mit mir reden"; La Sainte Bible: "Et j'entendis quelqu'un me parler depuis le Temple."</page><page sequence="8">608 Journal of Biblical Literature text of the MT.2" With regard to Ezekiel, however, Emanuel Tov's important findings concerning the relationship of the MT and the LXX of Ezekiel suggest that the lectio difficilior of the MT should not be accorded priority.21 The start- ing point for Tov's discussion is that the LXX is significantly shorter than the MT (by 4 to 5 percent), which leads to the question "whether the quantitative differences between the MT and LXX of Ez. were created by the translator or were already extant in his Hebrew Vorlage." Using evidence from word order, consistency in the choice of lexical equivalents, the choice of particular equiva- lents, and overall fidelity, Tov concludes that the translation technique of the LXX is, with regard to Ezekiel, "relatively literal and consistent." As a result, the minuses in the LXX are best understood not as free or imprecise translation but as reflecting a Hebrew Vorlage that was shorter than MT. Indeed, Tov argues that in most instances "the LXX reflects a more original text from a con- textual point of view, and the long text of the MT a secondary one. . . . The amplifications of MT represent an added layer of contextual exegesis, clarifica- tion and slight editing.""22 Applying Tov's findings to Ezek 43:6 suggests that the LXX Owvi) XaXoo6vtog is based on an early witness and is not a late exegetical plus. If so, the indefinite genitive of the LXX ("voice of a speaker") reflects an indefinite construct form most naturally rendered in Hebrew as =7M ip 7Un1, a phrase I will discuss at length below. In this way, the LXX provides a subject, 91p, that is absent from the MT.23 The LXX of Ezekiel does not use #0ovi as a clarifying, exegetic term. In fact, all other LXX occurrences of owvi reflect the MT ?i1p,24 which strengthens the possibility that 0ovwi in 43:6 corresponds to an earlier b11 that was dropped from the MT. The absence of ?lp from the MT of v. 6, how- ever, is problematic inasmuch as this change obfuscates the meaning of the verse relative to the LXX (and its presumed Vorlage). An intentional move from an earlier clear text (LXX) to a later obscure text (MT) is philologically counter- 2" On the distinction between exegetical and linguistic translation, see Emanuel Tov, The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (Jerusalem: Simor, 1997), 50-66. 21 Emanuel Tov, "Recensional Differences Between the MT and LXX of Ezekiel," ETL 52 (1986): 89-101. 22 Ibid., 91, 92, and the literature cited in n. 11. Tov's conclusion is that "the MT and LXX texts of Ez. reflect two different redactional stages of the book" (p. 101); so even though he focuses on the LXX minuses, the priority of the LXX to the MT holds for other textual differences, unless proven otherwise. 2: Or, if one understands "ln7. as a nominal form, the LXX's addition of p~1 "frees up" "17, providing the MT with a proper verbal predicate. 24 The verses in question are Ezek 1:24 (5x), 25; 2:1 (= MT 1:28); 3:12, 13; 9:1; 10:5; 11:13; 19:7, 9; 21:22 (= MT 21:27); 23:42; 26:10, 13, 15; 27:28, 30; 31:16; 33:4, 5, 32; 37:7; 43:2.

I will argue below that the MT has such a motive, but first we turn to the remaining instance of -n!n, Ezek 2:2. Ezekiel 2:2 Ezekiel has just seen the vision of the divine chariot and now witnesses "the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD" (Ezek 1:28). He pros- trates himself, and there follows an extended auditory revelation (Ezek 1:28bV3-3:15), which is introduced by the following: 17t:ln W11 mm:1 7j:1 7 n 4= Z1:=7 , M0 1 , 7t = 1:28 '37UI -1 ' :1- "1I" C " lI7 ":I KMl 2:2 ."? -17:1-w 74?r .U -70.u "r-rt 1:28 Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. That was the appearance of the figure of the Glory of Yahweh; when I saw it, I fell on my face. Then I heard a voice speaking.25 2:1 And it said to me: "Man, get on your feet and I shall speak to you." 2:2 Spirit entered me as it spoke to me and got me on my feet,"26 and I heard speaking with me. The word- 2-r in 1:28 is vocalized as a picel participle and so is not directly related to the present inquiry-though the "voice speaking" does not belong to the object of the vision, God's Glory. Were God's Glory the speaker, the verse might have read: *when I saw it I fell on my face. Then I heard the Glory of God speaking Or: *when I saw it I fell on my face. Then I heard the voice of the Glory of God speaking. Instead, the speech heard by the prophet breaks with the visual revelation that precedes it. The visual revelation is of the Glory of God, but the auditory aspect is attributed not to the in71 but rather to a "voice speaking." How is the clause to be understood? The LXX reads ica i'KVo(a 00vilv Xakofvrogf , "and I heard a voice of a speaker," a translation that takes 712 as nominal, forming a con- 25 argue for this translation below. 26 The action of the spirit parallels its appearance in 43:5, where it also lifts the prophet just prior to his hearing an unidentified (in MT) speaker "'In .with him.</page><page sequence="10">610 Journal of Biblical Literature struct chain with 1ip. This reading, while grammatically possible, raises a num- ber of difficulties. The indeterminate "a voice of a speaker" is awkward, since what follows is an extended oration in which Ezekiel's prophetic mission is delineated. This is clearly one of the key passages of the book, and it is curious that it would be attributed to "a voice" of "a speaker."27 Modern commentators have suggested that the vague "a speaker" is theo- logically motivated, an attempt to preserve the mystery of God.28 But Ezekiel has arguably just provided the single most graphic description of "visions of God" (Ezek 1:1) in the entire Hebrew Bible. Granted, the vision is described as the "appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh" (1:28), a triple media- tion that serves to dispel the notion that Ezekiel is describing Yahweh simpliciter.29 Still, the visual explicitness of his revelation is theologically prob- lematic, given the aniconic and antivisual voices within the Hebrew Bible, while the ascription of speech to Yahweh is a biblical commonplace-how much more when the hearer is designated a prophet. It is curious, then, that Ezekiel would charge headlong into the theologically loaded issue of God's visual appearance, but be forced into an oblique and (reading -1r: 7 ip as a construct chain) grammatically awkward presentation by the theological com- monplace of God addressing a prophet. Indeed, on Walther Zimmerli's and Moshe Greenberg's theological reading, Ezekiel's obfuscation of the source of the speech is counterintuitive. If the "I: is a figure shown to the prophet in order to allow God to remain "hidden in the manifestation of His glory" (to use Zimmerli's delectably paradoxical formulation), thus shielding God from anthropomorphism-should the Glory not shield God from anthropomorphic speech as well? These difficulties-theological and syntactic alike-can be avoided by adopting the alternative translation of 1:-r 7 ip that Greenberg cites in his 27 A number of translators have sought to mitigate the difficulty by presenting either the speaker or the voice as definite. KJV "I heard him that spake unto me" is an example of the former, while Walther Zimmerli's "And I heard the voice of someone speaking" (Ezekiel: A Commentary on the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel [2 vols.; Hermeneia; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1979, 1983], 1:89), of the latter. The Hebrew 1:27MI bjp, however, is ineluctably indefinite. 28 Zimmerli writes "[t]hat Yahweh's name is not mentioned in this, although 'the voice of someone speaking' is referred to cautiously, helps to preserve the mystery of the deity, hidden in the manifestation of his glory" (Ezekiel, 1:131). Moshe Greenberg similarly argues that "the expres- sion avoids ascribing the speech directly to the human figure visible on the throne in the apparition, as though reserving the source of the speech for the unseen God" (Ezekiel 1-20: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary [AB 22; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983], 61). 29 This interpretation is already found in the Mekilta of Rabbi Ishmael, where Rabbi Eliezer argues that the prophets were not granted sight of God but only of images, citing Ezek 1:1 ("The heavens opened and I saw visions of God") (Mekilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Shirata 3 [Lauterbach ed., 2:24]).</page><page sequence="11">Yadin: ipy as Hypostasis in the Hebrew Bible 611 notes: "And I heard a voice speaking.""30 Here the participle is verbal, and ?ip is the speaking subject rather than part of a construct chain.

It contains nR followed by an indefinite participle and, of course, the hitpacel vocalization of the participle. Most translations gloss the difficulty by rendering the verse as though "1.n were definite, the results being similar to those discussed for 43:6. Thus, KJV ("I heard him that spake unto me"), Luther ("und heirete dem zu, der mit mir redete"), La Sainte Bible ("et j'entendis quelqu'un qui me parlait") are clearly trying to make sense of the dif- ficult MT. The LXX provides a more coherent reading, KaQ i ov)ov avro) XaXoivro; 7tpb g6i," which suggests "'? "'M0 ~n# 90R 0 ("and I heard it [or: him] speaking to me"), where the MT nR is understood as a graphic corruption of 1~71 i ,"32 which would refer back to the speaking voice of 1:28: "And I heard a voice speaking, and it said to me ... and I heard it speaking with me." This reading fits nicely with the indefinite 17 in 1:28 and the definite reference to the ?'1p subsequently. On this interpretation, the Vorlage of the LXX 1:28bP- 2:2 (which is prior to the MT) is: Then I heard a voice speaking. And it said to me: "Man, get on your feet and I shall speak to you." Spirit entered me as it spoke to me and got me on my feet, and I heard it speaking with me. If the LXX of Ezek 2:2 is accepted, then it counts as another example of an active, mediating voice that takes the hitpacel participle "n07. The argument thus far suggests that the three instances of the hitpacel par- ticiple of dbr exhibit a number of similarities. Each of them arguably has ?1p as its subject. This is explicit in Num 7:89 and in (the pre-MT) LXX of Ezek 43:6, and it is a possible, though not certain, reading of the LXX of Ezek 2:2. Further, 30 Greenberg, Ezekiel 1-20, 61, note ad loc. 31 See, e.g., Isa 40:3, -1:27 la lMP (rightly translated by NJPSV: "A voice rings out: 'Clear in the wilderness ..."') and Isa 40:6, 'p -nH rp$ (NJPSV: "A voice rings out: 'Proclaim ..."'), where the more natural rendering of the Hebrew has the voice as the subject and the participle its verbal predicate. 32 So Zimmerli, Ezekiel, 1:89. The LXX is the basis for the NRSV: "and I heard him speaking to me."</page><page sequence="12">612 Journal of Biblical Literature in each case 'np7 appears in the context of divine revelation but is not explicitly characterized as God's (i.e., as o' ;r7 y or m-,7' ip).33 One may conclude ten- tatively that the Sifre Numbers' linking of the hitpacel vocalization of 7'.7 to a mediating voice in Num 7:89 is at the very least highly suggestive for the remaining occurrences of the form, in which the MT alters a smooth text (the LXX Vorlage) in a way that reduces the presence of the Ij. Ezekiel 1:24-26 A weakness of this argument is its reliance on the hitpacel vocalization, arguably a late Masoretic addition. In discussing Ezek 2:2, Greenberg makes this point explicitly, presenting the unusual vocalization as a late, theological addition, almost a Masoretic midrash: "The rare MT vocalization seems to be artificial-an exploitation of a textual opening for introducing a later reveren- tial linguistic conceit."34 Greenberg is right to warn against confusing later Masoretic pointing and the consonantal text, but the evidence for a hypostatic 9?1 is not wholly dependent on the vocalization. First and foremost, the explicit mention of a voice in the LXX of Ezek 1:28-keeping in mind Tov's argument that the LXX of Ezekiel is an earlier textual witness than the MT-is indepen- dent of the vocalization. An additional nonvocalization witness is found in Ezek 1:24-26, where the MT text is evidently corrupt: 11:*717= 7t7 Y M-IM ?117: 1:-7T:: ?117) MR UMZRI 24 rrnuun =jR-itu -ioR up7? ?Dn ?ip '7 l 25 '-7-IE= 7,%T7M 1:7== ;7:T7M 24.

And behold a voice (q6l) from above the firmament over their heads 26. in appearance like sapphire... The difference between the two versions is significant.36 The LXX does not contain the repetitions of the MT and as a result is a much clearer text. Why, then, does the later MT version contain corruptions not present in an ear- lier witness? Again, I believe the motivation is theological. c(Ivil in v. 24 means "sound" (of wings). But after the wings have fallen silent Ezekiel beholds a wOVi7 (v. 25). There is no speech reported, so the prophet does not perceive the Ocvil' by auditory means, and since the wov'~l is spatially situated above the heads of the angels, LXX v. 25 may be referring to a visible voice. The heavy- handed corruption of the MT aims, I propose, to obscure this interpretation. The MT undermines the hypostatic voice reading in two ways: First, it substitutes i ~m "'71 ("and there was a voice") for ~i 7MIM ("and behold a voice"), diminishing the possibility that the voice be understood as a visible entity. mmi often has the force of a demonstrative or deictic statement, especially when fol- lowed by a noun; ';nI does not.37 Second, the MT surrounds ?ip in v. 25 with instances of 1p7 that cannot mean "voice." The MT repeats 1:24b ("when they stood still they let down their wings") immediately after the appearance of the 35 T-mm regularly corresponds to LXX Kai 8o06. 36 Leslie Allen offers a helpful discussion of the complex relationship between the MT and the LXX here (Ezekiel 1-19 [WBC 28; Dallas: Word, 1994], 9 n. 24c), though I do not share his conclusions. 37 GKC ?147c; see also Adele Berlin, Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative (Sheffield: Almond, 1983), 62-63.</page><page sequence="14">614 Journal of Biblical Literature ?17 in v. 25a, "sandwiching" it between two references to the sound of the angels' wings and framing the ?ip as an audible sound rather than a voice spa- tially situated above the angels' heads as in the LXX. The repetition of v. 24b in v. 25b creates the expectation that v. 25a (the sip) will be analogous to v. 24a (sip meaning "sound [of wings]"). The other MT pluses serve the same func- tion: v. 24 contains a series of references to ?1p, all of which mean "sound" or "thunder," but surely not "voice." Here too the MT obscures the ip -voice of v. 25 (LXX and Vorlage) with a barrage of n1 1p -sounds. This, in any case, is the solution adopted by those MT scribes who have not dropped v. 25 altogether.38 On this interpretation, Ezek 1:24-26 contains MT corruptions that are aimed at blurring the hypostatic w~vil of the LXX, unrelated to the Masoretic vocal- ization. Ezekiel 9:1 One final passage should be considered, since Ezekiel himself suggested its relevance. Ezekiel 43:3 likens the vision at the temple to two earlier visions: the opening vision of the book, which has been discussed at length, and the prophecy on the destruction of Jerusalem in Ezek 9. If the argument thus far is correct and both Ezek 43:6 and 2:2 know of an independent, mediating voice, one might expect to find such a voice in Ezek 9 as well. The literary setting of this vision is much like that of Ezek 43. Ezekiel is led by a fiery figure to Jerusalem, to the "door of the court" (8:7), where he sees the idols and impuri- ties within the temple. He is then led to the inner court of the temple (8:16), where the fiery man promises retribution against the house of Judah, and then begins a new auditory revelation (9:1): R~l 1771 ?11F 7 213 I1M R &amp;2 R'7 "I'T 077M R MMMM 7,70DR "I =18:18 8:18 Therefore I will deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them. 9:1 Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying "Draw near, you execu- tioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand." The key phrase here is 1-7 ?1 '3"IT2 1f '1p in 8:18 and its near repetition,  p " 'T 11'3M'1, in 9:1. The RSV (above) understands both occurrences of n17? 5?11 as adverbial, roughly equivalent to ?n-7 ?~1:, and translates accord- :38 Nine MSS omit the verse; see BHS, ad loc.</page><page sequence="15">Yadin: 1p as Hypostasis in the Hebrew Bible 615 ingly, which is standard.39 The meaning of rn ~~i '? ]R wip'i (understood adverbially) in MT 9:1 is perplexing, however. The preceding verse, 8:18, describes the plight of idolaters that now must face the terrible wrath of God, who shows no mercy even though they cry out "with a loud voice." Here the loud voice fits well with the narrative context. But in 9:1 the speaker-the fiery figure that has been speaking since the beginning of ch. 8-resumes his com- munication with the prophet, but rather than speak he is shouting in Ezekiel's ear for no apparent reason a speech not even addressed to Ezekiel. Turning to the LXX, one finds that 9:1 reads: Owvi geyaXl ("with a great voice"), an adverbial understanding of n-7t rip that corresponds to the MT. The LXX of 8:18, however, is quite different: Kai ciEy) notiloe actoi; Leta 0ugoi oi (eiozat,0 6 608aLg6; , o; o8~i 8Ip i~gEl o ("Therefore I will deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity"). The MT of 8:18b (':n inip nlR# YiO R i i p717 ["and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them"]) is absent. Again keeping in mind the priority of the LXX, why would the MT add this clause? I believe it follows the pattern observed in Ezek 2:2 and 43:6, in which the change seeks to blur the theological notion of a hypo- static voice. Consider what the MT would be without the plus in 8:18: ?77? ?Ik7 ":TRM KIL7`1 9:1 ?OMR tfl '73U C7 7 F Zf ;ran ;rU 1: M18:18 8:18 Therefore I will deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. 9:1 And a great ?Ik cried out in my ears, saying, "Draw near, you execution- ers of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand." Here "and a great rnp cried out in my ears" strongly favors understanding yip as an active voice that cries out to the prophet. The LXX posits a speaking voice, but the MT plus in 8:18, with its unambiguously adverbial -n ~p ("they cry ... with a loud voice"), inclines the reader toward an identical-that is, adver- bial-understanding of 'r~ ~ 1 in 9:1. In other words, the MT plus in 8:18 jux- taposes an adverbial -r?n 1 to 9:1 to blur the hypostatic voice crying out in the prophet's ear. Finally it should be noted that a mediating voice is theologically consistent with the broader theology of Ezekiel, which includes several apparent hypostases. The clearest example is the hand that appears before Ezekiel in 2:9: ,9 KJV: "He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice"; NRSV: "Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice"; Vulgate: "et clamavit in auribus meis voce mnagna dicens.. ."; Luther: "Und er rief mnit lauter Stimme vor meinen Ohren"; La Sainte Bible: "C'est alors que d'une voix forte il cria h mes oreilles." On this form, see GKC ?117 s, t, citing 1 Kgs 8:55; 2 Sam 15:23; and another example from Ezekiel-l 1:13.</page><page sequence="16">616 Journal of Biblical Literature -SO M?"= 1: 771771 ", 7n7 ,*0 7' 77jM,71, ,- And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and lo, a written scroll was in it. The context leaves no doubt that this is a divine hand, as Zimmerli, Daniel Block, and others well recognize.40 But since God is not mentioned in the verse and the hand and its actions are not attributed to God, the hand appears as an independent, mediating agent.41 A less obvious but more common hypostasis may be the 7:1: itself, as John T. Strong argues in a recent article. Drawing from descriptions of the nature and role of the 711 in Isaiah and the Psalms, but most often Ezekiel, Strong argues that the 71:1 functions as the terrestrial representative of the God who resides in heaven: "It is my contention that the 711= was understood by Ezekiel to be the hypostasis of the enthroned divine king, Yahweh."42 The scroll-bearing hand and the possibility that the -11:, the main theological figure of the book of Ezekiel, is a hypostasis characterize Ezekiel's theology as potentially hospitable to a hypostatic voice.43 The analysis of the hitpacel -1rz-nprecipitated by the Sifre Numbers interpretation of Num 7:89-has been taken as far as it can go; there are no more instances of this form in the Hebrew Bible. There remains, however, the broader theological motivation for the hypostatic voice. Like other mediators, the voice appears in order to maintain God's transcendence, making contact with the material world so that God does not have to. It is not surprising, then, that the mediating voice appears in the context of the tabernacle (Num 7:89) and the temple (Ezek 43:6; 9:1), both sites of regular contact between the divine and the mundane that raise the question of divine transcendence. Given the theological impetus behind the mediating voice, might we not expect to find a mediating voice-or at least traces of one-in the other major site of rev- elation, at Sinai? 40 Zimmerli: "The original text of Ezekiel undoubtedly refers in 2:9 to the hand of Yahweh" (Ezekiel, 1:135); Block: "In light of the command in v. 8, the hand obviously belongs to Yahweh" (Daniel Isaac Block, The Book of Ezekiel [2 vols.; NICOT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1997, 1998], 1:123). 41' Like Ezekiel, Daniel contains both a mediating voice ("While the word was in the king's mouth, there descended a voice from heaven saying.. ." [Dan 4:28]), and a mediating hand ("Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written . . ." [Dan 5:24]). 42 See Strong, "God's Kab6d," 69-95, here 73. 43 Ezekiel's mediators may well be generated by the same theological convictions that cause him to avoid visual anthropomorphism in ch. 1, where Ezekiel describes God's entourage at great length but not the form of God itself. The LXX of Ezekiel discusses the voice openly, but the MT blurs these references. This discrepancy may be because the LXX translators were more accus- tomed to the idea of an intermediary voice owing to its prevalence in Greek religious literature (see Otto Betz, " ov,," TDNT 9:278-80).</page><page sequence="17">Yadin: ?Ip as Hypostasis in the Hebrew Bible 617 III. The Voice at Sinai/Horeb The Sinai narrative, Exod 19-24, is a very complex composite work, whose history has been the subject of a great deal of scholarship.44 These matters will be considered in the course of argument, but are not the focus of inquiry. The task at hand is to examine the traces of a mediating-voice tradition within the Sinai pericopes. The first verse to be analyzed is Exod 19:19: n'."n?Rm "In?' nom' -TnT nml 7"1-T "lot~nT ?Ip "nn' 19 7s "-nn ?: - 7"m'n ON-1 f 7-T-, VNI ":`0 7,T ?. Umm- --rn 20 '::,U 18. The whole of Mount Sinai was smoking since Yahweh had descended upon it in fire, and its smoke was billowing like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook mightily. 19. And the sound of the ram's horn was growing much stronger. Moses spoke and God answered with a voice. 20. Thus Yahweh came down upon Mt. Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and Yahweh summoned Moses to the top of the mountain and Moses ascended. (Exod 19:18-20) As biblical scholars have long recognized, the sequence of events narrated in these verses is chronologically impossible. Verse 18 states that Yahweh had already descended onto Mt. Sinai and (v. 19) communicated with God, but in v. 20 Yahweh descends onto Mt. Sinai and calls Moses to ascend the mountain. As a result, there is broad scholarly consensus that wv. 19 and 20 were not origi- nally connected but that v. 20 and the section that follows are an insertion.45 There is some controversy over what verse originally followed 19:19, which is a composite of two asyndetic clauses: v. 19a ("And the sound of the ram's horn was growing much stronger") and v. 19b ("Moses spoke and God answered 31p:"). This has led scholars to conclude that v. 19b-the key hemistich for the present analysis-"is not continuous with what precedes or follows it."46 There 44 The secondary literature on the composition of the Sinai pericopes is vast and cannot be discussed here. For a survey of relevant literature, see the first chapter ("Redaction and Theology in the Sinai Complex") of Thomas B. Dozemnan, God on the Mountain: A Study of Redaction, The- ology, and Canon in Exodus 19-24 (SBLMS 37; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989), 1-17. A work that is not cited by Dozeman but has played a major role in my understanding of these chapters is Arie Toeg, Lawgiving at Sinai [in Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1977). 45 See, e.g., Toeg, Lawgiving at Sinai, 21; Walter Beyerlin, Origins and History of the Oldest Sinai Traditions (Oxford: Blackwell, 1966), 8: "it is clear that the whole section xix. 20-24 is a later gloss." 46 John I. Durham, Exodus (WBC 3; Waco: Word, 1987), 267.</page><page sequence="18">618 Journal of Biblical Literature are two schools of thought regarding the translation of v. 19b: one renders ?Ip as "voice," the other as "thunder,"47 and I would argue that the former is to be preferred. "Voice" is a standard meaning of 7ip and fits the context of the Sinaitic dialogue between Moses and God. As Thomas Dozeman notes: "Although the singular qdl ... often refers specifically to the voice of God.... [T]he plural n;iip almost always occurs in the context of a storm . . and does not refer to a more specific divine verbal communication."48 Dozeman's observation is strengthened by Haiim Ros6n's argument that the "gender incongruity" exhibited by the singular and plural forms of ip (sin- gular: zero grade suffix [= "masculine"]; plural: --rt suffix [= "feminine"]) is a marker of countability and noncountability. According to Ros6n, nouns that exhibit this irregularity are discrete and countable in the plural but noncount- able in the singular.49 Ros n's explanation of the morphological pattern cannot be accorded the status of a general law, since there are a number of question- able cases50 as well as outright counterexamples.5' Ros6n's hypothesis does, however, hold for a large number of the nouns exhibiting the morphological "incongruity." Consider the following paired examples:52 * "", rnir Singular: "earth" or "land" or "soil" in a general sense; plural: discrete political or geographic enti- ties ?* v7, mnMM: Singular: "life force" or "spirit" (except in deter- mined legal phraseology); plural: "people, individu- als" * nn, ninn Singular: "spirit" or "wind"; plural: "direction" ?* 0, nl) Singular: "fame, reputation"; plural: "names" 47 See the rich discussion of Benjamin Sommer, "Revelation at Sinai in the Hebrew Bible and in Jewish Theology," JR 79 (1999): 422-51. 41 Dozeman, God on the Mountain, 27. 49 Haiimn Rosen, "On Some Nominal Morphological Categories in Biblical Hebrew," in On the Dignity of Man: Oriental and Classical Studies' in Honour of Frithiof Rundgren, special issue, Orientalia Suecana 33-35 (1986): 355-65; reprinted in Haiim Rosen, East and West: Selected Writings in Linguistics (Munich: W.

The singular Ip generally means "voice," or "sound"; these meanings are not discrete or countable. ?ip means "thunder" only in a grammatically determined state, namely, when it is identified as the voice of God. This is usually achieved with the construct mr7r 1 ip, which appears in meteorological contexts (e.g., Ps 29), but also by a pronominal suffix that marks the Ip as belonging to God. So while God's ip3 can manifest itself as (or is) thunder, the meaning of (undetermined) ?Ip is not "thunder. 53 The plural nnip almost never means "sounds" or "voices," but appears in explicitly meteorological contexts meaning "peals of thunder." In Exodus, Mr1ip is paired with 'n: ("hail") five times (9:23, 28, 29, 33, 34), once with :'p: ("flashes of lightning") in the Sinai epiphany (Exod 19:16), and once in a questionable meaning to be discussed below (Exod 20:18). Elsewhere it is paired with "rz ("rain") (1 Sam 12:17, 18; Job 28:26), and only once appears in the meaning of "sounds"-in the construct state (Ps 93:4).54 It seems, then, that the pair sip, ni~ip generally fits the pattern identi- fied by Ros6n: the -Ot ending refers to a discrete, countable plural ("peals of thunder"), while the zero-grade ending has a more abstract sense ("voice, sound"). If so, ip: Iz" :' nm does not mean "God answered [Moses] in a thunder" but "God answered him by a voice." But now a different problem presents itself, namely, why is the vocal nature of God's speech stated? Were speech conveyed by something other than a voice, the situation would be unusual and the nonvocal medium made explicit. But there is no need to state that speech is conveyed by voice. There 53 Jeremiah 10:13 may use 3i in this sense, but the MT is clearly corrupt. 54 In Ps 93:4 in the phrase ,',- :'n rnpm ("than the sounds of great waters"). The entire psalm describes a sea storm, and the phrase is probably the result of syllabic considerations; see Mitchell Dahood, Psalms II: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (AB 17; New York: Doubleday, 1968), 341-42. The phrase 7lt~'-3 in Ps 29 refers to thunder, but that only means that the voice of God is identified with thunder, not that p as such means "thunder." See the similar analysis by Dozeman, God on the Mountain, 27 n. 19.</page><page sequence="20">620 Journal of Biblical Literature are countless occurrences of speech verbs (1:7rn, Ha'1, " '1, ~~n, ') where the vocal medium is assumed but never stated; these verbs occur hundreds of times in the Hebrew Bible without the addition of 'ip:. Why does Exod 19:19b state that ?ip: m ',"'7n;i? In order to answer this question it is necessary to examine this statement in conjunction with the verse that textual scholarship suggests (though not with complete unanimity) was its original sequel, namely, 20:18a:55 And all the people saw the qolot and the flashes of lightning ( 'rn-) and the sound of the trumpet (qOl haso-p'r) and the mountain smoking.... Two issues must be examined in relation to this verse. First, it is unclear what it means that the people saw the peals of thunder (nibp). Some of the translators have sought to soften this incongruity by translating '~ln as "perceived" (RSV) or "witnessed" (NRSV), verbs of perception that are not sight-specific; and commentators have suggested that the verse is meant to convey "something stronger and more inclusive than 'hearing,' e.g., synaesthetic 'seeing,' or 'wit- nessed and experienced.'"'56 But it is odd that such a momentous and singular experience would have as its objects the blast of a trumpet and the C""rE?, which may be mere torches (see discussion below). The second difficulty is the pairing of nflip and D'"'E. There is broad con- sensus among modern translators that these terms are to be rendered "thun- der" and "lightning," respectively. If n ip is the correct reading, then "thunder" is appropriate, since the plural from regularly occurs in meteorological con- texts, as noted above. The same cannot be said for C"7Em , whose root meaning is "torches"; it does not mean "lightning," and never appears in meteorological contexts. When employed metaphorically, it is tied to imagery of burning (e.g., Isa 62:1), while a number of verses juxtapose "?rn and lightning as distinct elements.57 It is curious, then, that Exod 20:18a should use C""r to signify flashes of lightning, particularly when C'p:2, the regular term, appears along- 55 A number of scholars argue that Exod 19:19b was originally followed by Exod 20:1, the Decalogue. For a survey of the scholarship supporting Exod 20:1 as the sequel see Toeg, Law- giving at Sinai, 20-21 (though he rejects this view); and Durham, Exodus, 269. The more widely accepted view identifies Exod 20:18 as the original sequel to 19:19b. Toeg argues for this position persuasively (Lawgiving at Sinai, 22, 37-38), and see the literature he cites there. Among more recent discussions, see A.

Furthermore, there is a broad consensus among the ancient translators that c"rn means not "flashes of lightning" but "torches."58 Both biblical semantics and the testimony of the ancient translators suggest, then, that C-rn~7" are not flashes of lightning but torches, in which case the con- text is not meteorological and it is unclear why nlp-"peals of thunder"- would be paired with C'1"7E. Indeed, without the meteorological context, n~1p becomes a very problematic reading. But there is an alternative. The LXX of 20:18a has Kai ncftq ;6 6ao; )pa iiyv ovilv ("and the whole people saw the [singular] ?Ip and the torches etc."). The LXX does not resolve the problematic representation of auditory phenom- ena that are perceived visually, so the singular ?Ip (where MT has ni?) is not a harmonizing gloss. Quite the contrary, the singular Ipa is difficult since the phrase "~mEa ~ appears later in the verse and the repetition is awkward.59 The oddness of the singular form argues for its originality. The LXX reading also has a distinct advantage over the MT as the nonmeteorological singular ?Ip does not foist upon the 1o:"7n the otherwise unattested meaning "lightning." The LXX is also the theological lectio difficilior-suggesting that the Israelites saw "the ?ip "-while the MT is on much safer ground, describing peals of thunder during the epiphany at Sinai, a fact already established in 19:16. Taken together, these arguments provide significant evidence for preferring the LXX 1ip to the MT ni~p. Thus far I have introduced two arguments concerning the Sinai epiphany: first, that ?Ip in Exod 19:19b means "voice" and not "thunder," and, second, that the LXX reading of Exod 20:18a (@ovil, sip) is preferable to the MT (nibp). These are not bold arguments. The former is comfortably within scholarly con- sensus. And while I know of no precedent for the superiority of ip to nip, it is generally acceptable to prefer the LXX to the MT when the former is either the theological lectio difficilior or accords with biblical semantics, both of which hold in the present case. Building on these arguments, the reconstruction of the original juxtaposition of Exod 19:19b and Exod 20:18a yields: "Moses spoke and God answered him by a voice, and the entire people saw the voice.60 L8 The LXX has ta;g aLnta6ag; Onkelos has Wt71= (= torches); and the Vulgate has lampades. 59 The singular form is "particularly odd since this means that the phrase now occurs coordi- nately in the same form, once for the [qol] and once for the sound [q6l] (of the trumpet)" (John William Wevers, Notes on the Greek Text of Exodus [SBLSCS 30; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990], 315). 60 The MT of the remainder of Exod 20:18 may reflect the conflation-perhaps as an inten- tional blurring-of this visible voice with other elements of the theophany, the peals of thunder and</page><page sequence="22">622 Journal of Biblical Literature This reconstruction, if correct, establishes the presence of a voice at Sinai. The voice was an intermediary between God and Moses and was visible to the children of Israel.61 And while on its own a reconstructed verse may not prove decisive, a similar view is articulated in Deuteronomy's description of the mountain epiphany (Deut 4:1-40), a passage in which one hypostasis-the "great fire" of Deut 4:36-has already been recognized by scholars.62 A second may be the subject of 4:11-12: 11. And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, wrapped in darkness, cloud, and gloom 12. Then YHWH spoke to you out of the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form except a q61. The underlined phrase has been the subject of extensive discussion and, in what is by now a familiar pattern, most translators discount the possibility of a visible voice. This may be a mistake. Verse 12b is divided thematically: v. 12ba refers to the auditory experience of the theophany ("you heard the sound of words"), while v. 12bp deals with the visual, asserting that they perceived no form "except a q61." If we remove the last two words of the verse (1p 'rnior) the the blasts of the horn. At present, this suggestion remains speculative; I know of no compelling explanation for the MT of Exod 20:18b. 61 The existence of a visible, mediating voice may lie at the heart of a tannaitic dispute recorded in the legal midrash to Exodus, the Mekilta of Rabbi Ishmael. Glossing Exod 20:18a ("And the entire nation saw the voices [LXX: voice]"): "They saw the visible and heard the audible-these are the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Aqiba says, They saw the audible and heard the visible" (Mekilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Horovitz-Rabin ed., 235, corrected according to the comments of Meir Friedmann (Ish-Shalom), Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael with Meir Ayin Commentary [Jerusalem: n.p., n.d.

As for the "great fire," as schol- ars have recognized, the function of this fire is to mediate between God and Israel, distancing God from the site of revelation. Thus R. E. Clements writes that Deut 4:36 contains "no suggestion ... of a descent of Yahweh in any fashion, but only of the appearance of fire and of a voice out of the fire" (God and Temple [Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1965], 90); and Jeffrey Tigay notes that Deut 4:36 "states that there was indeed something on the earth when God spoke but it was not God" (Jeffrey Tigay, The JPS Torah Commentary: Deuteronomy [Philadelphia/Jerusalem: Jewish Publication Society, 1996], 56). On the revisionary force of Deut 4:36 (relative to, e.g., Deut 5:4), see Stephen A. Geller, Sacred Enigmas: Literary Religion in the Hebrew Bible (London/New York: Routledge, 1996), 30-61.</page><page sequence="23">Yadin: ip as Hypostasis in the Hebrew Bible 623 resulting phrase, "you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form," portrays the auditory and visual aspects as an absolute contrast: the former existed, the latter did not. This contrast is not strengthened by 1p '7nblr; it is weakened. The Israelites perceived no form except a q61, a visible voice. Here, too, the LXX supports this reading. Where the MT of Deut 4:11 states that the mountain "burned with fire to the heart of heaven, wrapped in darkness, cloud, and gloom," the LXX adds to this list a "great voice" (EKaIEto Icupt io; To op0pavoi oK;cogo yv64og uxxea 0ovil eyad )-a voice that descended to the mountain and then was seen by the Israelites.63 Deuteronomy 4:12 echoes the view found in the reconstructed Exod 19:19b + 20:18a: the Israelites stood at the foot of the mountain and saw a hypostatic voice.64 IV. Conclusion The present study consists of a series of close readings that argue for the presence of a hypostatic voice in certain parts of the Hebrew Bible. The biblical passages do not easily map onto accepted source-critical models. Though the isolated and fragmentary nature of Num 7:89 obscures its provenance, the cul- tic context of the verse and its terminology strongly suggest that it is Priestly. Moses enters into the tabernacle, the central priestly institution of the desert years, and hears the voice from n17r i-l, a term that appears exclusively in Priestly sources,65 in which case the mediating voice is a radical expression of P's anti-anthropomorphic views, a topic that has been much discussed in recent scholarship.6 Exodus 19:19b + 20:18a may be the product of a Deuterono- 63 The variant has not received much attention, most likely because the possibility that it expresses a meaningful theological position was discounted. Wevers writes that "[a] popular B gloss has added povi l a.eyaIXl at the end, but this was taken over from 5:22, where the three nouns also obtain" (John William Wevers, Notes on the Greek Text of Deuteronomy [SBLSCS 39; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995], 73). 64 The theological connection between the theophany accounts in Exodus and Deuteronomy can be explained in source-critical terms if one assumes that Exod 19-24 underwent Deuterono- mistic redaction, a position pioneered by Lothar Perlitt and recently defended by Thomas B. Doze- man (God on the Mountain; see 37 n. 1 and 38 n. 7 for a survey of sources on the Deuteronomistic redaction of the Sinai narrative). However, the reading offered here does not depend on this expla- nation. If the Exodus account of the theophany is ascribed to an earlier source, Deut 4:12 may be understood as an interpretation of Exod 19:19b + 20:18a, perhaps based on the same Hebrew text of Exodus that is reflected in the LXX. This explanation accords with the view that "[t]he oldest Jewish commentary on the Book of Exodus appears in another biblical text: the Book of Deuteron- omy" (Sommer, "Revelation at Sinai," 432 [though I consider the characterization of Deuteronomy as a Jewish commentary anachronistic]). 65 On the Priestly terminology, see C. L. Seow, "The Designation of the Ark in Priestly The- ology," HAR 8 (1984): 185-98. 66 See Jacob Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16: A New Translation with Introduction and Commien-</page><page sequence="24">624 Journal of Biblical Literature mistic redaction, but it may also belong to an earlier stratum that is exegetically reworked in Deut 4:12; the provenance of Deut 4 is itself a matter of debate.67 As for Ezekiel, it is generally accepted that his theology is Priestly, though Risa Levitt-Kohn has argued that Ezekiel combines Deutronom(ist)ic and Priestly traditions.6" The picture is unclear, and it is difficult to attribute the hypostatic voice to a single source. Some general conclusions are nonetheless possible. Chronologically, most of the sources discussed appear in relatively late biblical strata. Numbers 7:89 resists definite dating, but scholarly consensus rules that it is not part of the ear- lier strata of P. Ezekiel and the Deuteronomistic sections within Deuteronomy are clearly late, and Exod 19:19b + 20:18a may be late, though this is less cer- tain. The general lateness of the hypostatic voice is strengthened by the prolif- eration of such voices in Second Temple literature, including Dan 4:28.69 In terms of the manuscript traditions, it is clear that the LXX is far more comfort- able with the notion of a hypostatic voice than the MT, and it is possible that this holds true for other theologoumena. Finally, it is worth noting the impor- tant role of the Masoretic vocalization of 7170 in Ezek 2:2 and 43:5. Both verses were examined solely on the grounds that (like Num 7:89) they contain a hitpacel vocalization of 71r7M, and in both cases the superior manuscript tradi- tion of the LXX indicated the presence of a hypostatic voice. Although the Masoretic pointing is later, in these cases it improves the consonantal text by preserving phenomena blurred or excised from the MT but present in the pre- MT Vorlage of the LXX. tary (AB 3; New York: Doubleday, 1991), 58-61; Knohl, Sanctuaryj of Silence, 128-36. It should be noted that the absence of a mediating voice in the P account of Sinai cannot be counted for or against the existence of a hypostatic voice in P, since Baruch Schwartz has shown that "P's idea of the [Sinai] theophany is totally dissimilar to the theophany of E and D .... In P no words are spo- ken, no Decalogue or other such sample of divine law is proclaimed" ("The Priestly Account of the Theophany and Lawgiving at Sinai," in Texts, Temples, and Traditions: A Tribute to Menahemn Haran (ed. Michael V. Fox et al.; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1996], 125). 67 Eckart Otto, for example, argues that Deut 4 uses-and thus is subsequent to-Deuteron- omy, the Deuteronomistic History, prophets, and the Priestly torah ("Deuteronomium 4: Die Pentateuchredaktion im Deuteronomiumsrahmen," in Das Deuteronomiu ml u)nd seine Quer- beziehungen (ed.

" In an article published in 1986, James Charlesworth argues that the vision described by John is one of a visible, hypostatic voice.7o Rejecting the tendency to translate v. 12 as "I turned to see the one speaking to me," Charlesworth argues that John is reporting an encounter with a visible hypostasis: "If 'the voice' was conceived in early Jewish thought and perhaps in early Christian cir- cles as a heavenly being, then one can legitimately talk about seeing her, or him."71 Interestingly, the passage in question contains a remarkable number of allusions to the biblical texts that have been examined in the present study. 1. The presence of the spirit is familiar from Ezek 2:1-2 and 43:1-6. 2. The sound of the trumpet recalls the trumpets in Exod 20:18 ("And all the people saw the voice [LXX] ... and the sound of the trumpet"). 3. The great voice behind the speaker recalls Ezek 3:12, a passage that is very similar to the ones discussed above ("Then the Spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the LORD arose from its place I heard behind me the sound [qol] of a great noise").72 4. The vision of "one like the son of man" has been characterized as "a combination of Ezek 1:26, 9:2, 11 ... and Dan 7:13,"'" passages that contain (on my reading) explicit references to the mediating divine voice. 5. The seven lampstands allude to the seven lamps whose erection is com- manded during (or immediately following) Moses' encounter with the 70 James H.

And the LORD spoke to Moses saying, 'Say to Aaron, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lamp- stand.'" 6. The description of the voice as rushing waters recalls Ezek 1:24 (and 43:2), discussed at length above.74 Charlesworth concludes that "[t]he evidence is impressive, and I am persuaded that before A.D. 100 Jews ... believed in the existence of a celestial being they called 'the voice."''75 In light of the above discussion, I suggest that John of Patmos consciously alludes to key passages in Ezekiel and Daniel and to Num 7:89-8:1 in order to present himself as part of a group of prophets or visionaries that have received revelation from the "voice." Charlesworth's argument can be taken a step fur- ther. Not only were there Jews who believed in a celestial being called "the voice"-John of Patmos and the rabbinic author of the Sifre Numbers, to name two-they believed that the existence of this hypostatic voice was attested in the Hebrew Bible itself. This essay suggests that these later readers were cor- rect. There are biblical passages that know of a hypostatic voice, and these may well be the source of the Second Temple revelatory voice and perhaps also of its contemporaries, the "vocal" hypostases Logos and Memra. 74 The double-edged sword (pogatia) issuing from the mouth of the heavenly figure may be connected to the difficult crux in the LXX of Ezek 43:2, which translates M':2- )'D 'Ip 13 1p1 ("and his q61 was like the q61 of many waters") as Wai ca ovil i; napEClporil; ; (ovil 8tt Xactaa6vov tnokXov ("the sound of the camp was like the sound of many dual sharpeners of swords"), as though the L1p issuing from the figure's mouth were swordlike. The image of the sword in the mouth may also be (midrashically?) related to the Hebrew nl'2' ?nM (Ps 149:6) and its alternate form n1'fl 72n (Prov 5:4). All this is clearly speculative; both the image of the sword in the figure's mouth and the LXX of Ezek 43:2 require fuller discussion. 7 Charlesworth, "Jewish Roots," 37.</page></plain_text>
