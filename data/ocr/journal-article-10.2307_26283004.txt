<plain_text><page sequence="1">APOSTROPHIZING THE FEMININE IN FINNEGANS WAKE rrfr Shari Benstock FINNEGANS Wake. What only certain readers of Joyce's text hear as I say these words is the absence of the apostrophe marking the possessive position of "Finnegan" in relation to "wake." Others not aware of Joyce's grammatical revisions will hear—rather predictably—the operation of the apostrophe that they cannot see: Finnegan 's wake. Although the apostrophe cannot be enunciated, it makes itself heard. It also insists on being seen, precisely because it is not there: helpful editors and printers continue to reappropriate the apostrophe to its (appropriate) place. Indeed, the miss ing apostrophe of this tide announces its presence and finds a life of its own against all efforts to eliminate its subversive workings in the Wake. The missing apostrophe of Finnegans Wake creates discomfort, if not outright embarrassment.1 It produces a sense of unease, a stepping out 'Barbara Johnson comments that apostrophe "involves the direct address of an absent, dead, or inanimate being by a first person speaker. . . . The absent, dead, or inanimate entity addressed is thereby made present, animate, and anthropomorphic" (185). Jonathan Culler writes that apostrophe creates embarrassment: "literary critics . . . turn aside from the apostrophes they encounter in poetry" (135), thereby making the same gesture apostrophe itself makes—a turning aside or away from the sub ject, "to repress [the apostrophe] or rather to transform apostrophe into description. Whether this is because writing, in some innate hostility to voice, always seeks to deny or evade the vocative, it is a fact that one can read vast amounts of criticism without learning that poetry uses apostrophe repeated ly and intensely" (136).

By its absence, the apostrophe calls attention to recognition of the Wake as a written text, whereas reading strategies make the Wake accessible by insisting on the "telling" qualities of its production, thus repressing its written forms.2 The repression of apostrophe as rhetorical form is bound, almost inex pressibly, to the repression of apostrophe as grammatical marker in Finnegans Wake. Apostrophe gives itself to this double suppression through its structure, which both binds and unbinds the subject. The Wake traces these "apostrophic" effects through ruptures in traditional grammatical forms, rhetorical conventions, generic limits, and formal textual features. The missing apostrophe of Finnegans Wake signals an inherent failure within the structure of apostrophe to bind the subject (Finnegan) to a consistent, singular, and coterminous identity. Apostrophe functions through failure: it points to the inevitable slippage of subjectivity and the limit of figurability. The law of apostrophe, which is not unlike the law of genre articulated by Jacques Derrida, operates negatively—always pro ducing the terms of its own violation. Sexual difference, for instance, is figured in the Wake as the suppressed feminine of the apostrophic struc ture, a violation of rhetorical and grammatical codes—indeed, a resistance to and subversion of these phallogocentric laws. A rational (masculine) logic constructs its "sense" against an irrational (feminine) "nonsense" and figured through the gendered familial structures of the Porter family. To follow the (missing) apostrophe of the Wake is to follow its simultaneous suppression and reinforcement, to learn how the family is structured around sexual difference, a structure that can operate only through the repression of (the knowledge of) sexual difference.3 We can retrace some of these effects by investigating the work of apostrophe within the genre of the love letter (as literary genre and social contract) and the movement of alphabetic letters (A, E, O, and 1, p, s) that reveal a relation between censorship and authority, sexual difference and cultural marginality. Further, the apostrophe opens the textual space for the footnotes in Book II.2, where Issy as representative of denigrated domestic language, female 2The notion that the Wake is somehow more available, more understandable, when read aloud, that its language frequently empowers aural rather than visual techniques of wordplay, has long been a commonly held assumption. Indeed, a standard method of teaching Finnegans Wake is to read it aloud, which suggests that what is heard in the Wake may be more evident, even more trustworthy, than what is seen. What apostrophe—in all its forms—suggests is not merely that the opposite might be true (writing takes precedence over telling in the Wake) but that the relationship between telling and writing is far more complex than we have so far thought. In its genre, apostrophe invokes through writing an image of voice that is only possible in writing. Moreover, this genre has a gender—it is feminized, which accounts in part for the "embarrassment" always associated with apostrophe. It reveals the feminine, giving it voice. 'See Jacques Derrida's explanation of the relation between genre and gender in "The Law of Genre." I discuss the "law of genre" and the "law of apostrophe" in Textualizing the Feminine, from which this essay is taken. Portions of it were read at two James Joyce conferences (University of Califor nia, Riverside, 15 May 1987; Marquette University and University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, 15 June 1987). 588 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">speech, explodes the sexual-textual code of family structures and scholarly pretensions. She discovers the female body as a place of "scripture" and "stripture," a text open to the violations of patriarchal inscription. I. DIVIDING THE PATERNAL ONE AND THE MIRROR (M)OTHER Apostrophe simultaneously calls to memory and the absence of recall, the vigilance and failure of censorship—a repression. The missing apostrophe of Finnegans Wake also directs us toward a double path of elaboration and displacement: "Who speaks?" "Who writes?" It opens a correspondence of doubles, I and you, the sender and projected receiver of secret messages. The Wake unfolds in scenes of writing, where letters are written, posted, concealed, discovered, plagiarized, falsified, and used to seduce, threaten, blackmail, and expose. The plot turns on questions of authority, which is contested through the very act (of writing) that would seem to establish—or underwrite—its claims. The Wake examines the nature of "correspondence" and disputed authority in twins and doubles (Shem and Shaun, the "sosie sesthers," Issy and her mirror im age) and through failed efforts to establish the omnipotence of the Name of the Father, who is both HCE—the one whose initials are duplicated in nearly every sentence of the text—and Here Comes Everybody, pro liferated into everyone and no one.4 The threat of duplication and division inherent in language is il lustrated by reference to the tower of Babel, the attempt to establish a particular language and to reduce all language to one language. The tower symbolizes the effort to create a form that cannot be reproduced, to replace the unspeakable (and unwritable) Name of the Father with the name of the son who—by building the tower—establishes a name for himself. He puts his own name in place of the father's. The result is confusion and conflict ("Is the Pen Mightier than the Sword?" [306.18-19]): father is divided against son; son is divided against brother; home—a man's castle—is now a batdeground. The pattern of potential strife characterizes the father-son relationship of the Earwicker family, where the father's authority (his name) is threatened by his sons. His possible overthrow is averted only by the division of the language between the warring sons. Shem and Shaun do not speak the same language, often dividing between themselves (as in the Lessons chapter) the textual space on which their 4Dcrrida follows the twinning effects of the Wake in "Two Words for Joyce" and in La Carte Postale, which plots a doubled and divided history between letter writer and "toi, mon amour," the feminine figure of address: "Our history [story] is also one of twin progéniture, a procession of Sosie/sosie, Atree/Theste, Shem/Shaun, S/p, p/p (penman, postman) and more and more I metempsychose myself of you" (155). He submits the famous Wake initials—ALP, HCE, S/S, P/P—to the apostrophic effect within the relation between Socrates and Plato, speech and writing. The tower of Babel creates "apostrophic" effects, splintering the subject and language, and is itself an apostrophic effect that "creates" languages. BENSTOCK 589</page><page sequence="4">story is told. Dividing language between them, the brothers (unwittingly) insure patriarchal privilege and the continuation of the father's name, exiling women (mother and sister) to the margins of discourse. The "he war" of the Wake (HCE's war) is fought by the pen—"his penisolate war" (1.6)—and the pen divides. The heart of the brother battle in the Wake is writing, an act that both links the twins (as penman and postman) and pits them against each other in their efforts to possess the letter—that is, to possess the father's name and be his inheritors. Although Shaun is the father's favored son, Shem claims linguistic powers (powers that frighten his father and brother) and thereby threatens the father's sovereignty. This disputation of language between the sons is also the father's punishment for their (presumed) attempts to appropriate and displace his name. It appears as the confusion of Babel, the interdiction of and demand for translation. Derrida writes: "YHWH at one and the same time demands and forbids, in his deconstructive gesture, that one hear (and understand) his proper name in the language; he mandates and erases the translation; he devotes himself to the impossible and necessary translation. And if this double bind is first that of YHWH, if each time there is a double bind in the structure of the proper name, if there is a 'God,' the name of God, well I let you follow, if you can follow, the writing of the proper name, that of the penman Shem, showing himself interminably consigned to the detours and wanderings of Shaun the postman, his brother" {La Carte 179). In "Two Words for Joyce," Derrida poses the question of Wake writing in these terms: i) the need to authorize a text by signing one's name to it; 2) the demand of the father (God, the Master, YHWH, HCE) that one hear and not hear, inscribe and hide, his name in the language, a demand that mandates and erases the translation of his name through the language, a demand that is the double bind of all writing; 3) the division between language and that which it invokes, between God and "God"; the necessity of language disseminated and dispersed (language laisser suivre), made to move from sender to receiver (language faire suivre), to fall into the hands of, and risk being translated by, a third party; of necessity, the letter Shem pens is posted through Shaun, following a trajectory that Shaun as carrier rather than Shem as writer determines. Overlooked in this analysis of the Wake language wars are women's words. The letter that divides father from sons and sons from each other is dictated by the (m)other. The brothers' batüeground, the divided textual space of Book II.2, is traversed by Issy's annotations, her "postscripts" to the text. She annotates not with a pen(is), which she does not possess, but with her voice, creating a triologue within the catechism of the geometry and grammar lessons. Textually, this third voice is kept at the margins of discourse, displayed in a running commentary of footnotes 590 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">along the bottom of the page. This spatial configuration accurately represents woman's traditional place with respect to male appropriation of language (in particular, scholarly activity): she is relegated to the out side, the bottom; her scrawl is an afterthought, and her voice is intrusive. Her postscripts run counter to the disputations of the primary text. She does not grant authority to this activity of erudition and endowed knowledge, which has been by cultural birthright (that is, by patriarchal law) the domain of males, who from earliest times have scrawled marginalia, notations, grafitti, inscriptions in languages to which men were the legitimate heirs. Her voice upsets its simple divisions, translating its terms into the "little language" of love and domesticity, traversing its boundaries with her otherness. From her position outside the text proper, beyond the borders of its dialectic, she establishes a counter dialogue (play ing both parts herself) with another woman—the (m)other—where they discuss the activities of husbands, lovers, and children. Like her brothers, the daughter is learning her lessons: her script is the mother's life. The Lessons chapter presents examples of the Earwicker children learn ing to write letters, scripting them from a copybook model that bears many resemblances to Anna Livia's letter, which appears toward the close of the Wake. "Dear and he went on to scripple gentlemine born, milady bread. . . . And how are you, waggy" (301.10-15) begins Shaun's effect, a close match for his mother's ("Dear. And we go on to Dirtdump") and his sister's: Dear (name of desired subject, A.N.), well, and I go on to. Shlicksher. I and we (tender condolences for happy funeral, one if) so sorry to (mention person suppressed for the moment, F.M.). Well (enquiries after all-healths) how are you (question maggy). A lovely (introduce to domestic circles) pershan of cates. Shrubsher. Those pothooks mosdy she hawks from Poppa Vere Foster but these curly mequeues are of Mippa's moulding. Shrubsheruthr.

Shlicksheruthr. From Auburn chenlemagne. (280.9-28) At one level this letter is the kind of chatty, informal "introduction to domestic circles" that the young Issy writes under the guidance (even the dictation) of her mother, a model homemaker, one of whose duties is to maintain correspondence and write letters—of condolence, congratula tion, acknowledgment, appreciation, and so forth. Indeed, the letter addresses the mother who, as A. N. (Nourse Asa) is a type of Anna Livia, from whom Issy admits to having "learned all the runes of the gamest game ever" (279.Fl). The mother also signs the letter (under the name of "Auburn chen/emagne. Pious and jfture fair one" [280.27-28]), duplicating and enclosing—within its salutation and signature—aspects of Anna Livia as mother, daughter, lover, mistress, and sister. BENSTOCK 591</page><page sequence="6">The letter echoes aspects of ALP's manifesto, a defense of the father against his accusers {FW 119-123), which is also the Maggy letter dug up by Belinda of the Dorans on the midden heap (111.5-24). The daughter's voice, however, incorporates Issy's language of seduction and exploits a provocative vocabulary that reveals—without specifically ad dressing (or naming)—the object of her desire: F. M., Father Michael, the parish priest (pp), who serves as representative of God the Father (a figure of Earwicker) and in the place of Brother Mick (Shaun, who plays at various times the roles of priest, postman, and policeman—a representative of the law and figure of authority), the "prints chumming" for whom Christinette "can be when desires Soldi" (exchanged or sold as the double). Issy's letter follows an extended footnote (279) that usurps the scripted narrative and explores the same conflation of the old/young lovers (here, Mark of Cornwall and Tristram), Issy doubling as Isolde and also writing an erotic letter to her teacher: "The good fother with the twingling in his eye will always have cakes in his pocket to bethroat us with for our allmichael good." The doubled object of desire ("fother/allmichael") is counterbalanced by the divided Issy, present as the Maggies (of the rhyme in which the brothers play Mick and Nick; of the park scene where the two young girls tempt Earwicker) and as Christine Beauchamp whose schizophrenia split her into Chris and her letter writing opposite, Sally. The split between One and Other is evi dent in Issy's letter through the double entendre of its language ("kissists my exits"), which suggests that Issy's Other knows a great deal about the "desired subject" and its "suppressed" object, a division apparent even in the grammatical distinctions between first and second persons ("I and you") and in the separate, third-person description of the writer's actions. The writer's actions duplicate the sexual stimulus implicit in her linguistic gestures: "Shlicksher. . . . Shrubsher. . . . Shlicksheruthr." The descriptive voice mimics Issy's lisp, a clue to her presence in various Wake texts, where she reveals her presence through a "little language" of seduc tion, which doubles consonants to divide her into "pepette" (pp), the counterpart of her twin brothers, the penman and postman. The apostrophic effect at work on the doubles can be heard in the third voice— the daughter's (m)other—that traverses the I-Thou doubling. The Wake tries to account for the doubled daughter and traces Issy's psychic and sexual development through writing to preverbal states, follow ing a path through the dream to the cradle. Issy's practice letter is linked to this dream pathway, which is littered with letters: her model letter to A. N. is introduced by a dream sequence where she writes a scene her father hopes she cannot remember: "A scene at sight. Or dreamoneire. Which they shall memorise. By her freewritten Hopely for ear that annalykeses if scares for eye that sumns. Is it in the now woodwordings . . . then will singingsing tomorrows gone and yesters outcome . . .?" 592 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">(280.1-7).5 The letters of the Wake form a transcript, a transcript of a dream. Issy's letters are significant attempts to solve the mystery of the dream and recover the story's ambiguous origins. They suggest in their "wood wordings" her presence in the park, her complicity in the primal scene. She writes from knowledge, but a knowledge that is recovered "for eye that sumns" as she writes: "All schwants (schwrites) ischt tell the cock's trootabout him. . . . He had to see life foully the plak and the smut, (schwrites). . . . Yours very truthful. Add dapple inn" (113.11-18). This letter of accusation is written in Issy's language but signed under her mother's initials, making it appear that Anna Livia has somehow author ized the account, that perhaps it was written under her dictation. Seeking to exonerate Earwicker, Anna Livia's own letter protects the "Reverend" by wiping the written slate clean of any indiscretions that might incriminate him: "(the mother of the book with a dustwhisk tabularasing his oblitera tion done upon her involucrum)" (50.11-13). This attempted cover-up is also an uncovering, a revelation to be feared both by Anna Livia and Earwicker: "my deeply forfear revebereared, who is costing us most fortunes which I am writing in mepetition . . ." (492.27-28). The contradictory manifestations of authority in Wake documents derive from an unremembered scene in the nursery where the infant Isabella sees her father's erect penis. She seeks to expose him by disclos ing his sin ("I'll be the mort of him!" [460.22]), but her effort depends on the recovery of an elusive piece of information about her own past. The father's dream, in which she was apparently present, is dimly remembered as part of her own experience. Part of her suspects an oc currence ("Something happened that time I was asleep, torn letters or was there snow?" [307.F5]), while another voice hints at its sexual cir cumstances: "Of course I know you are a viry vikid girl to go in the dreemplace and at that time of the draym and it was a very wrong thing to do, even under the dark flush of night, dare all grandpassia! " (527.5-8). The search for the story's origins is driven by this suspicion that the Other has witnessed in the dream the father's incestuous longings for the daughter. These origins, however, rest outside language, in a preverbal event, the daughter's observation of her father's erection: "The infant Isabella from her coign to do obeisance toward the duffgerent, as first futherer with drawn brand. Then the court to come in to full morning" 5These dimly remembered scenes are constructed through the primary sense of sight and sound, present in the Wake text as both dream work and film montage. Earwicker is "framed" by the scene of indiscretion in the park, and Issy is one of his observers; his sin is having observed two young girls micturating. Although Finnegans Wake is generally considered to be linguistically a far more experimental text than Ulysses, its sensory apparatus is more restricted, confined to ''seeing-through-the-ears" rather than elevating the chemical senses of taste, touch, and smell to the order of sight and sound. The Wake is the more traditionally Freudian of the two texts; Ulysses operates according to a more Lacanian scheme of unconscious desires. I discuss the hierarchy of senses and the development of the unconscious in Textualizing the Feminine (Chapter One); see also Ellie Ragland-Sullivan's discussion of Lacanian sensory structures (16-30). BENSTOCK 593</page><page sequence="8">(566.23-25). In this instance the relative clarity of Wake language belies the impossible effort fully to bring unconscious, nonverbal "events" into consciousness through language. The (m)other tries to tell what she knows and the mirror/dream image promises communication between unconscious and conscious. The translation of the message transposes its parts, however, and one woman is exchanged for the Other (mother for daughter, sister for sister). The mirror creates a mirage, an effect of the apostrophe that calls out for (and also prevents) translation. The mirror marks a barred passage (') that prevents a crossing of the line between conscious and unconscious states (a barrier that dreams presumably negotiate). The one who is in a position to expose the patriarch is the one who has been required to pay obeisance to his erect phallus. The daughter is thus caught in a double bind. Unable clearly to remember the scene he fears, the father is caught in the double "blind" of his authoritarian role. Earwicker both desires to know his unconscious desires and wants to remain innocent of them. He represents censorship (which is the law) and inflicts self-censorship. Anna Livia, desiring to clear her hus band's name of any hint of guilt, also enacts censorship, "tabularasing" her own letter, which is written to Earwicker and about him. Issy's letters employ a language of double entendre precisely because they are doubly cen sored: addressed to the mother (or her sister, Maggy), they concern the father (majesty) and are signed by his wife (a signature that is a forgery, stolen from the mother by the daughter as she tries to usurp the mother's position in the family). The daughter's letters are then incorporated into the mother's letter to the father, their contents altered so that they respect his authority, do obeisance to his majesty, show respect for his name. The Wake dream letters reveal certain barred correspondences between the unconscious and the conscious, between the unconscious and the law that both demands and forbids translation—the double bind of censor ship inherent in all writing. Wake letters are written to one censor (the ultimate censor, HCE) and conveyed through (the writing of) another censor (ALP), their progress from writer to reader effectively blocking off the crucial events of the dream (letter), allowing the censor no access to what he has censored. Moreover, the action of censorship (its transference) is the action of love: out of love for her husband Anna Livia does not want (him) to know the ways in which he loves his daughter, who is ALP's own youthful mirror image. In censoring love letters, the Wake images love as silence. It is rendered textually through a series of blank spaces and omissions that require the story to be taken up again at a later point. Inscribed dozens of times in the Wake, on four occasions silence stops the storytelling, which must recommence again (14.6, 98.2, 334.31, 501.08). These "silences" are not, of course, ascribed to any voice that calls them into being; silence is marked by forms of inscription that 594 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">must be read but cannot be heard: "(Silent.)"; "silence:"; "(Silents)"; "SILENCE." Issy, sitting before her mirror image, wants to silence the knowing voice of the Other, the accusing voice heard in the letters and mirror dialogue. The voice mimics the (male) lover, instructing her twin in the art of seduction. Lips and labia are opened and silenced (momentarily) by the sexual act, which is also a form of murder: "Now open, pet, your lips, pepette, like I used my sweet parted lipsabuss with Dein Holohan of facetious memory taught me after the flannel dance ..." (147.29-34). Voice and vagina are conflated, and kisses promise more illicit pleasures. The Other's voice cajoles, seduces, instructs, and mocks, creating a repressed countertext of sexual-textual slips. The more illicit the love, the less amenable it is to conscious suppression: incestuous longings of father for daughter, daughter for father, sister for sister, slip through the language. At stake are sexual difference, the enforcement of family ties and paternal privilege, and the vulnerability of wives, sisters, and daughters under patriarchal law. In sleep, the norms and forms of family life are transgressed and reinstituted: "O, foetal sleep! Ah, fatal slip! the loved one, the other left, the bride of pride leased to the stranger!" (563.10-11). The journey toward desire's truth leads down the memory lane ("mememormee!" [628.14]) of writing: here, the one and the other meet and miss each other. The setting of nursery and bedroom, the acts of writing and dream ing, coincide when young Issy, seated at her mother's vanity table pretend ing to be her mother as she plays at grown-up with face creams and make up, converses with her mirror image. This scene duplicates a dialogue begun in the cradle when baby Issy "talkfed] petnames with her little playfilly," the image of herself in the "shellback thimblecasket mirror" that reflected her own image, "her dearest friendeen" (561.36-562.1, 561.15-16). The passage exploits an ambiguity of spoken and written language marked by the intrusion of Issy into the series of riddles posed of Shaun and Shem. Shem's question concerns the desire for an absent lover: "What bitter's love but yurning, what' sour lovemutch but a bref burning till shee that drawes dothe smoake retourne?" (143.29-30). The answer posits a dialogue between pepette (pette, pitounette, pipetta) and her mirror opposite, with whom she is jealously competitive; it reveals a seducer ("y°u lovely fellow of my dreams" [146.6]) who is perhaps Shem, Shaun, or the father ("old somebooby"). The mother is a third (and, like the men, absent) party to the scripting of this scene, referred to in the third-person, while the two doubles exist as "I" and "you." The "I" tries to extract information about sexual practices from "you": "I thought ye knew all and more, ye aucthor, to explique to ones the significat of their exsystems with your nieu nivulon lead" (148.16-18). BENSTOCK 595</page><page sequence="10">The mirror image is both author and actor ("aucthor"), the one whose authority is needed to sustain the writing. The literary setting for this scene is Swift's Journal to Stella and the psychological background is taken from Morton's Prince's The Dissocia tion of a Personality, which is a case history of Christine Beauchamp. These two works describe clandestine writings between lovers/enemies who employ petnames and pseudonyms to hide identities and exchange roles as the writers and receivers of letters. The alliance of doubles in the writing act is a collaboration that breeds both narcissistic love and hate: "I hate the very thought of the thought of you and because, dearling, of course, adorest . . . when we do and contract with encho tencho solver when you are married to reading and writing . . ." (146.18-22). The authority of the reading-writing marriage contract is both undermined and sustained by the reading-writing process itself. Contractual authority is tested when the mother's image is recreated and resisted by the mirror doubles. The mother is present in the (m)Other's voice, imaged in the "O" of "O mind you poo tickly" (144.34) and the series of responses ("Of course") that punctuate the conversation, and in the reflection of the oval ("O") mirror. II. APOSTROPHIZING THE SUBJECT Oh, how it was duusk! (158.19) 0! 0! 0! Par la pluie! (158.23-24) In the Wake's workings, "foetal sleep" and "fatal slip" produce a blank space in the text, a gap in the storytelling signalled by the apostrophe. "Finn, again!" (628.14) Anna Livia calls in her final rush to the sea. Her apostrophe to Finn and the separation of "Finn" from "again," marked by the comma of address and directive, turn the nar rative back on itself, to the "riverrun" of her wake and his waking. The dream displays its apostrophic effects in the desire to know ("Now tell me, tell me, tell me then!" [94.19]) and the need to forget ("And do you remember, Singabob, the badfather" [94.33]). The apostrophe marks a point of departure and return—a turning point—and its enclosing gesture (') at once binds and unbinds the grammatical construct. A form of ad dress that calls out desire for the Other's voice, a desire for response, apostrophe contests narrative authority and subjectivity. Always a call to memory, apostrophe even in its grammatical status is an image of voice, a calling out and calling up. It produces subjectivity. It would make the blank spaces of "m'm'ry" (460.20) speak. The apostrophes in "m'm'ry" mark the absence of two vowels, E and O, the alphabetic symbols of Ear wicker and Anna Livia, the principal players of this drama, male and female, earth and water, dreamer and letter writer. Of the five Wake family members, Anna Livia Plurabelle is most 596 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">closely associated with apostrophe. She is called up through the "O" that opens Book 1.8, called forth in the gossip of the washerwomen, who read the signs of her sin in the dirty laundry, just as her sons will later discern her private parts—"the O of woman" (270.25)—in their geometry lesson. Anna Livia's chapter is probably the best known of the Wake, the one most given to "reading aloud" (as Joyce's own reading attests), the one that argues most seductively for the necessity of "telling" the tale. This "O" is voice and vagina, sign of the orifices from which ALP's own voice emits the sounds of "babbling, bubbling, chattering to herself . . . the sloothering slide of her, giddy-gaddy, grannyma, gossipaceous Anna Livia" (195.1-4) and from which her "daughtersons" have emerged from the night into the light. The "O" marks the passageways of female sex uality, and Anna Livia's sexuality is the major topic of conversation in this chapter. The opening apostrophe to her mimes the "O" that becomes the geometric figure for the vaginal delta through which her children enter the world: O tell me all about Anna Livia! I want to hear all about Anna Livia. Well, you know Anna Livia? Yes, of course. . . . (196.1-4) The shapes are doubled in the geometric figure reproduced on page 293, so that the O figures female buttocks, the triangular shape held within the oblong O of the female genitalia. But these O's also reveal a reflected interiority, as if seen through a speculum or reflected inward and downward in the mirror of water, which produces a three-dimensional view. This mirroring effect is available only textually, however. When Anna Livia's invocation is read aloud, nothing of its graphic spacing or design is communicated except, perhaps, as the double O's echo and mirror in sound what the Wake gives to sight. While the missing apostrophe of the title Finnegans Wake cannot be heard, its absence unmarked by the voice, the rhetorical status of apostrophe is a call to the voice, producing in the "O" an image of voice that the Wake reproduces textually. The Wake is a reservoir of such effects, and I mention several here (from French) to suggest how the Wake negotiates marked and unmarked languages. When voiced, the phrase, O! O! O! Par la pluie!, carries with it rain {la pluie) and umbrella (par la pluie). The "1" of la is lost, elided, so that rain and an article as protection against the rain (parapluie) are both heard. Brotfressor Prenderguest's fork ("a pronged instrument," like the various appearances of the capital E signifying Earwicker) does damage to a letter he is reading at the breakfast table, the signs of its destruction evident in diacritical markings: "ay A, of à grave Brofèsor . . . acùtely professionally piqued" (124.9-10). Read aloud, the markings remain "un voiced." Precisely because "grave" is missing the adverbial marking of BENSTOCK 597</page><page sequence="12">its accent grave, it articulates—in speech—an English construction. To the eyes, however, the misplaced accent grave (over "a") changes the article to a preposition (translated into English as "to"). The effect of the French accent troubles the eye but remains unheard by the ear. A repeated question in the Wake, "How do you do, todo, North Mister?" (95.5—"How do you do today, my fair/dark sir?") appears intoned through various languages. As rendered "in French," it reads, "Come on, fool porterfull, hoisered women blown monk sewer?" (16.4-5), and although the individual words of this phrase are English, syntactically they find their way to English only through a French pronunciation. The English form does not include a "fool," "hosiered women," or a "monk" (see versions at 225, 35, 54, 72, 93, 95, 160, 186, 332, 409, 466, and 511). The old French motto, Honi soit qui mal y pense offers another example, rendered variously in the Wake as "Honeys wore camélia paints" (113.17) and "O'Neill saw Queen Molly's pants" (495.27-28). These recognizable English words appear in a syntactical structure that sounds as if it should make sense (but does not); they echo the French, which both does and does not hold their "meaning." No more does the empty "O" of the call to Anna Livia hold within it her meaning, the mystery of her origins, the dark secrets of her sexuality or her reproductive capabilities. The "O" not only is a call to the voice, to ha voice, but it also gives voice to the desire for enclosed meanings, originary powers, safe passage, and the dark sleep of the womb. Anna Livia is known by the sound of her waters, "lilting on all the time" (627.21); her babbling, bubbling, and "sloothering slide" are calls of seduction to her "devious delts" (197.22). The homophonic connec tion Jonathan Culler hears in eau and "O" in Baudelaire's poem "Le Cygne" (Pursuit 144) is heard in the call for Anna Livia as well: the washer women, working on the banks of the River Liffey, hear Anna Livia's story in the waters as she flows by. The artificiality associated with the "O," the trope of apostrophe, allies itself with the waters of nature, a deflection—or a naturalizing—of poetic artifice. The scene along the bank of the Liffey is not, however, a moment of lyric poetry, although lyricism vies with gossip in a pattern of tonal reverses throughout the chapter. This is a scene of narration. It is a story told through the dialogue of two women whose raucous, low Dublin accents contrast with the under currents of the river running past. The traditional "I-Thou" relationship of apostrophe is deflected by the opening gesture of the chapter, "O tell me all about Anna Livia!" The "O" is undirected and undifferentiated; it comes from nowhere immediately identifiable; it is not provided a reading context; it fills a space and silence that do not render a single reading in this gesture. "O" is neither a call from Anna Livia nor to her; she is neither the summoner nor the summoned. Anna Livia appears neither through her presence nor through her voice in lieu of her presence. 598 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">She appears in stories told by the two gossips, whose calls and answers repeat forms common to Issy and her mirror image. The "O" of address is a plea to narrative ("O tell me till about Anna Livia"), and narrative we know shares nothing with apostrophe. Narrative is all that apostrophe denies and resists. The in vocative "O" is a call, presumably, from one woman to another, from one who listens to one who will speak. This "O" is also a plea for the Other's voice, and for an-Other voice. The apostrophe pro poses a dialogue, but it requires a third party. Barbara Johnson explains that in Baudelaire's poem, "Moesta et Errabunda," the opening address ("Tell me, Agatha") "makes explicit the desire for the other's voice": "Tell me: you talk" (185). Anna Livia, however, is an-Other, an extra, to the dramatic dialogue of this chapter. The two women telling stories about her engage each other in an "I-Thou" relationship ("You'll die when you hear. . . . Yes, I know, go on" [196.5-7]). Anna Livia—as woman, as river—negotiates a space between the two voices that echo and invite her. She does not "tell"; she is "told," albeit in a mimicry, or ventriloquizing, of her voice(s). The "O" of the chapter marks her absence, a death-knell of invocation. "O tell me all about Anna Livia!" both is and is not apostrophic. Like apostrophe, the call negotiates a terrain between nature and the an thropomorphic (the name, "Anna Livia," includes both river and woman). The object of attention exists only in reference to the speaker, to the one who apostrophizes. The call partakes of both direct and indirect address, so that "O" suggests the absolute impossibility of its endeavor to an thropomorphize the river as woman exactly to the degree that it renders the fiction of its own success: we "hear" Anna Livia (as if) she has responded to the call. Culler argues that apostrophe signals at once a radical interiority (the address is inward, not outward) and fragmenta tion (the voice, as subject, is disembodied, divided, echoing on the wind). The apostrophe is a net in which its "subjects" are caught in a "time present ... a temporality of writing" that has nothing to do with the temporal movement of narrative (148-149). If, as Paul de Man has sug gested, apostrophes are about "an activity of the speaking subject," the speaking subject of the Anna Livia chapter appears to have been divided as a dialogue between "I-Thou."6 Anna Livia is not present to this 6See Paul de Man (29). Culler outlines several levels of apostrophe involving the "I-Thou": the constitution of the object ("thou") .as another subject "with whom the poetic subject might hope to strike up a harmonious relationship. Apostrophe would figure this reconciliation of subject and object" (143); the "O" of apostrophe as trope that might parody apostrophic procedures, so that the "O" is « an "invocation of invocation" (144); the apostrophic fiction implicit when the poet addresses Earth, "that the things of earth function as thous when addressed" (this claim would find approximation in ALP as river [145-146]); that the call to the O of the address "which seems to establish relations between the self and the other can in fact be read as an act of radical interiorization and solipsism" (146). Culler reads apostrophe "as sign of a fiction which knows its own fictive nature ... to stress its optative character, its impossible imperatives: commands which in their explicit impossibility figure events in and of fic tion" (146). BENSTOCK 599</page><page sequence="14">dialogue in her voice, although the ventriloquist's trick of making us think she is there, speaking through the other(s), seems a quite successful sleight of sound maneuver. If she is here, she is recalled through her actions, in a narrative that traces her sexual indiscretions on her "drawers." She is a text, read in the dark as night falls, obscuring the signs of her sin, and as the water flows, washing away the evidence.7 The Anna Livia Plurabelle chapter is perhaps the best example of the Wake's call to the voice, where a tension vibrates between the written and spoken word. As the sign of possession, "Finnegan's Wake," the apostrophe is a marker that the reading voice effaces: it disappears. In its presence or absence on the page, this sign is either seen but not heard, or heard but not seen. In its genre, the apostrophe allies an undifferen tiated, unmarked "O" of invocation with the specificity of address ("O wild West wind," Shelley writes in arguably the most famous of all apostrophes). What is demanded is a voice, and one that is essential, univocal, that belongs to the "one and only." But Anna Livia does not respond in her voice, or if she does that voice is registered through the conversation of the two gossips, who mime not only her voice but the voices of all those others who populate their narrative world. Anna Livia's "other" voice, the sound of water, provides an almost unheard under current to the rise and fall of call and answer across the Liffey waters. Apostrophe does not carry the mark of gender, nor does it delineate a genre. It remains suspended between the written and spoken, its genre in question. Apostrophe does not refer to an "essence" of woman that rests in her voice, which is the seductive mode that she has been culturally assigned, as the gaze or reading eye is said to belong to the masculine. Anna Livia is a tributary, a coming together of springs, streams, rivulets, and waterfalls that rush toward the "sloothering slide," the sluice, the delta, her "O." The apostrophe, the grammatical marker of possession that is called up every time we call out to the genre of apostrophe, is the sign of this internal difference, of non-possession, of non-belonging. Either as river or woman, Anna Livia is not reducible to an essence, a voice: she speaks, if she speaks at all, difference(s). Earwicker also speaks a form of difference, identifiable in his stutter. His affliction is made worse at guilty moments, when he recalls the scene in Phoenix Park, for instance, and the textual doubling of letters ("ff," "kk") or syllables ("Shsh shake, co-comeraid!" [36.20]) mark an involun tary repetition of sounds. The stutter appears to oppose the "O" of pure voice (which would overcome absence, even death) by haltingly announc ing itself through a failure to communicate. Earwicker's stutter signals 7The double mark of reading and washing that obliterates the text is taken up elsewhere in the Wake, importantly associated with ALP as her letter both repeats and refutes the charges against Ear wicker. In "Nightletters" I have examined these reading/writing effects. 600 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="15">his sin ("sinnfinners," with its doubled consonants [36.26]), just as the stains on Anna Livia's drawers signify her failings. The stutter marks both absence (of meaning) and excess (of sound). It calls attention to a difference within; h is the sign of the (failed) effort to make univocal and consistent the multiplicities and inconsistencies of behavior. Textually, the stutter doubles and divides, opening a space of difference—from self and others—whose effects are apostrophic. The stutter undoes the logic of the double, the call of One for the Other; it is the site of a linguistic falling away, already figured in the fall that opens the way to babelization and Anna Livia's babbling brook. Earwicker's stutter and the stains on Anna Livia's drawers are, of course, signs of a sexual fall, so that lapsus lingua and lapsus sexualis are registered both verbally and visually. Earwicker as the "Reverend . . . majesty" of the Wake letter is called forth in the magiscule of the letter E, his siglum, sign of his sovereignty and presumed eloquence. Just as Anna Livia is invoked with every ap pearance of the "O" and "A," even when these letters appear in con texts where she is not present, Earwicker too is evoked by the appearance of his siglum. Meaning attaches itself to the movement of the letters, even when the letters are separated from any contextual bearing that would give rise to meaning (as when the first word of a sentence begins with an E or O, or when A stands alone as a indefinite article). The status of the siglum O, however, differs from the A and E in that it represents not only the (female) voice but also woman's vagina, through which pro geny emerge. The "O" sounds a sexual call to the phallic; it signals the sexual orifice, biological origins—the source. E and O are apostrophic effects that call up Anna Livia and Earwicker, and the separation of these letters from any word proper marks their textual exile as alphabetic sym bols, cut off by the enclosing stroke of the apostrophe. They are left to float and fly; their effects are disseminated "E'erawhere in this whorl" (6.24; everywhere in this world), whirling on the wind, spiraling in the ear. The alphabetical configurations 1 (Issy's lisp), p (postman/penman), and s (Shem/Shaun) carry apostrophic (and catastrophic) effects of separa tion and exclusion. Cut off, these letters stray through the text detached from the parental body: "the small p.s. ex-ex-executive capahand in their sad rear like a lady's postscript" (42.8-9). The confusion of letters as modes of correspondence and alphabetic symbols overturns any systematic effort to recover what is lost or displaced according to the law of apostrophe. Although all six letters disseminate throughout the text, the vowels E, A, and O gravitate toward origins, sexual unions, the desire for knowledge of sources, and are drawn to the delta of ALP's siglum A. Very generally, this first group evokes the parents, HCE and ALP, and is associated with the vagina and throat. The consonants 1, p, and s inscribe the children, and are identified with penis and lips. Issy's lisp is heard in the sibilants BENSTOCK 601</page><page sequence="16">of her seductive messages, whereas the doubled threat of her brothers, Shem and Shaun, is apparent in the power of pen and post. The letters "p-q" serve several functions, marking the mirror opposites through which the daughter is read (pepette, Coquette [239.33]); the Prankquean, a female marauder and counterpart to both Earwicker (as Scandinavian in vader) and Anna Livia (especially as water and river, urination and vaginal liquids); and the brothers, both twins and opposites, who do battle with each other for possession of the mother and combine forces to overthrow the father. The shapes of these letters suggest the form of spermatozoa that disperse and swim against the current. Their multiple numbers are opposed to the singular ovum. That is, letters as alphabetic characters in the Wake are sexualized and map an entirely sexualized landscape. Following the t(r)ails of these letters, we discover signs of flawed speech and failed communication as the Wake traces the alliance of sin and speech, the slur or hesitation in speech that announces sin. The speech defects of father and daughter, whose incestuous coupling is specularized by the dream, are signs of their unlawful desires. His is a "hisshistenency" (146.34-35) and hers a lisp: "He fell for my lips, for my lisp, for my lewd speaker" (459.28). Wakean "s" sounds are associated with Issy's lips, where they suggest sighs, whispers, the "shimmers" of Nuvoletta's "lightdress" (157.8), the swish of skirts, sounds of the river reeds, and the stir of the air: "The siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of the ver grose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades began to glidder along the banks greepsing, greepsing, duusk unto duusk . . ." (158.6-9). The "s" announces the serpent in the garden of Eden, the flaw in the immortal scheme, the sound of the tempter's speech as a mark of forbidden knowledge, the sting of death: "O hce! O hce!" (291.Fl). Repeated, the "s" draws itself out in Earwicker's "hisshistenency" (146.34-35), which carries in its wake the hissing of his detractors, the snake in the grass, the hiss of the asp, and the sounds of micturition. The "s" also traces the flaccid form of the penis, which erected writes a "capital Pee for Pride" (296.5) in the appropriate place of the woman's anatomy: "in Milton's Park under lovely Father Whisperer . . . making her love with his stuffstuff in the languish of flowers and feeling to find was she mushymushy" (96.10-12). Bernard Benstock has demonstrated that the "1" and "s" sounds couple "as the gossip crosses and recrosses the river . . . and the seduc tion of young Anna Livia provides conjecture for the washerwomen: 'Letty Lerck's lafing light throw those laurals now on her daphdaph teasesong petrock' (203.29-31)."8 The liquid l's and swishing s's combine in the •I follow Bernard Benstock's close reading of the 1, p, s movements in Joyce-again's Wake (148-155). He includes far more examples than are possible here, but note that the echoes of the serpent's "hiss" 602 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="17">temptresses: the "lilithe maidinettes" (241.4), "two disappointed solicitresses" (90.16), the "saucicissters" (96.13), "two stripping baremaids" (526.23), "the Misses 0'Mollies" ( 106.34), "one dilalah, Lupita Lorette" (67.33) and her "sister-in-love, Luperca Latouche" (67.36). The doubled "1" and "s" combine with the "p" of pepette's "little language" and Issy's baby talk and lisping "s." Seated at her vanity table, she pens a letter to her lover, her "pettest parriage priest" (458.4). At her looking glass, Issy is also Alice ("Alicious, twinstreams, twinestraines, through alluring glass or alas in jumboland" [528.17-18]), whose narcissism threatens to drown her "in pondest coldstreams of admiration forherself" (526.28-29). She addresses her Other, her rival in love, as "you pig, you perfect little pigaleen" (143.35), practicing a series of poses. The radical shifts in tone move from the seductive ("Tell me till my thrillme comes!" [148.2]) to sadism ("You want to be slap well slapped for that" [148.6]) to vampirism: "Yes, the buttercups told me, hug me, damn it all, and I'll kiss you back to life, my peachest. I mean to make you suffer, meddlar. . . . Bite my laughters, drink my tears" (145.14-19). She begs for the punishment of the pen ("Pore into me, volumes, spell me stark and spill me swooning" [145.19-20]), and calls for translation and trans gression: "Transname me loveliness, now and here me for all times" (145.21). She is a "hot lisbing lass" (553.18) whose teenage sexuality focuses on petting and the "parted lipsabuss" (147.30), where the lisp is a lapsus, a "lipsus of some hetarosexual" (120.35). Imitating her mother before the oval mirror of the make-up table, Issy paints a face that is itself a letter, "of eyebrow pencilled, by lip stipple penned" (93.25). Indeed, the links between "lips" and "letters" are forged throughout the Wake. Dion Boucicault's play, Arrah-na-Pogue ("Arrah of the kiss") is an important Wakean literary source, a play from which Joyce borrowed the character of Sean the Post and in which a secret message is conveyed by a kiss. Joyce's spelling of "pogue" sugests poke and penis ("poghuing her scandalous" [388.23]), where an earlier reference that pervade the Wake, as Phoenix Park is an analogue for the Garden of Eden. Issy's lisp allies her with the snake: she is a "liss in hunteriand" (276.F7), and her lisped, "Liss, liss! I muss whiss!" (148.26) suggests as well an alignment with Lilith, aprocryphal precursor of Eve, and Lily Kinsella in the Wake. The yoking of the "Is" sound with "P" (pee) also suggests urination, as does the p-q inversion (the Prankquean), which combines in the yonk shape of the letters both urination and invagination. Benstock includes a detailed discussion of these references on 152-154, and suggests that "P-q becomes a leitmotif . . . not just by dint of incorporation into proper names of the two seductresses or the single Prankquean figure ("Peena and Queena" (377.18-19); "prunktqueen" (250.29), among others], but in the very flow of language" (153-154). The patterns of coupling (pq, ps, Is, and so on) established by these alphabetic characters are undone by the movement of the letters themselves, which appears to be random, establishing accidental contacts. Their effect is divisive, destructive of patterns and motifs. They also enforce mean ing even when they appear where they should not be or in "contexts" where their placement seems out of place or irrelevant. Stated differently, these "symbols" refuse symbolic status. Carried along as part of the Liffey's litter, they find no resting place. They are métonymie, transgressive, and hold within them revolutionary potential. BENSTOCK 603</page><page sequence="18">("in Arrah-na-pogue, in the otherworld of the passing of the key of Two tongue Common" [385.3-5]) suggests lingual sexuality, the passing of the letter from mouth to mouth. This image is repeated in the last words of the Wake—"Lps. The keys to. Given!"—reminiscent of Molly passing the seedcake from her mouth to Bloom's, a scene recalled at the close of Ulysses. In the play, Sean the Post is called on to sing ("Open the dur softly, / Somebody wants ye, dear"), and the image of the open mouth asking the woman to "open the door" appears variously in the Wake as the request to open the lips: "now open, pet, your lips" (147.29); "to ope his blurbeous lips" (477.28); "what passed our lips" (528.2-3); "My Curly Lips Demand Columbkisses" (105.32). Miming the image before her oval mirror, Issy "praxis oval owes and artless awes" (458.35-36) while writing a letter. The letter's last request is "kissists my exits" (280.27), prefigured in Wake associations between lovemaking and letter writing, the violence of brother battles and wifebeating, efforts to read the ara besque script of the Book of Kells ("that last labiolingual basium might be read as a suavium if whoever the embracer then was wrote with a tongue in his (or perhaps her) cheek" [122.32-34]), and a "lady's postscript" that pleads for financial assistance: "I want money. Pleasend" (42.9-10). Letter writing and lovemaking, letters and labials, are bound together by the Wake dreamwork. The "lps." of the final line of the Wake are both lips and lisp, elsewhere associated with "please," the plea of the woman to her other and also the pli of the envelope which encloses her sexual secrets. The Wake seals, stamps, and posts woman through the mails. She is portrayed as a letter whose covering must be slit open and whose message is ravaged in order to be read. The destructive instru ment is a fork (fTI) whose "therrble prongs" (628.5) ALP fears. Woman's plea is "please stop, do please stop, and O do please stop" (124.4-5). The plea (and pit") contained within the letter return us to the letter's circuit, where Shaun the Post plays a crucial role. As a sign of forbidden desire, the letter traces a tortuous route through the postal system, along a pathway that both leads to and is a diversionary tactic against incest. Entrusted to Shaun, who is the embodiment of canonical and common law, the letter catches him in a double bind: the need to deliver the letter and the desire to suppress it. That is, the postal system itself has an in vestment in seeing to it that the letter both arrive and not arrive at its destination. Thus Shaun delivers the letter always into the wrong hands (which are also the right hands), insuring that it is continually deflected, diverted, displaced, and detoured. The diverted plot and scrambled discourse of the Wake are at one level effects of the letter's nonarrival. 604 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="19">III. ETERNALIZING THE GEOMATER, MARGINALIZING THE GIRLISH GIGGLER That is to sight, when cleared of factions, vulgure and decimating. (289.F1) The Wake constructs its postal system of desire on the body of Anna Livia, the River Liffey, that traces its route from Sallygap to Dublin Bay. Along this canal the Viking invaders made their way into Ireland, up the vagina of Anna Livia. The sigla of its postal code construct a sexual code as well, the doubled "p" signifying the threat of the twin sons and the double identity of the daughter; the "S" and "P" marking the penis in its flaccid and erect forms; the "S" tracing the spiral cone of the vagina, the "commodius vicus of recirculation" (3.2) of the river. The letter/dream of desire starts and ends in the woman's body—the keys to which are given by Anna Livia through her "Lps" located at the mouth of the river, the labia at the entrance of the vaginal canal. Riding the river's wave, the letter rests in the "Gyre O" of the vagina and is buried in the midden heap, the "midden wedge of the stream's your muddy old triagonal delta" (297.23-24). This letter, which was never mailed, constandy moves through the postal system, retracing the map of desire in "appia lippia pluvaville." Shem draws a map of the postal system in the geometry lesson. Com posed of a triangle enclosed by two circles overlapping to form an oval, the "system" is the mother's body, which must be identified by its in dividual parts. Shaun fails to give the correct answer, forcing Shem to reveal the figure on which the drawing is based, lifting the mother's apron so that they can peer up the opening. Anna Livia's internal parts emit sounds, smells, and liquids through the safety "vulve" of her "three ingls." At the point where Shem makes "a capital Pee for Pride down there on the batom" (296.5-6) of the drawing, he designates the point of entrance and exit to this fluvial canal: the entrance for the penis and "penmark," the exit for the "modest mock Pie out of Humbles" (296.9), Anna Livia's offspring. This place on woman's body represents the gateway to that ever searched for but never discovered source, the origin of dreams, stories, letters, thoughts and "tots" ("Where did thots come from?" [597.25]). Earwicker's sleep tries to recover this source: "The logos of somewome to that base anything . . . comes to nullum in the endth" (298.19-22)—Alpha and Omega, birth and death, a dark place of secrecy and safety. The geometry drawing is a riddle of femininity; it signifies woman ("This it is an her" [298.1]). This "her" is drawn, lettered, and quartered by Dolph (Shem); she is a script to be read and delivered by (Kev) Shaun. Even when instructed to read the drawing by joining the alphabetic symbols ("join alfa pea and pull loose by dotties and . . . eelpie and paleale by trunkles" [296.24-27]) to see "figuratleavely the whome of your eter BENSTOCK 605</page><page sequence="20">nal geomater" (296.36-297.1), Shaun cannot decipher the code. He looks in the wrong place ("But you're holy mooxed and gaping up the wrong palce" [299.13-14]), apparently seeing in the figure a drawing of the brain ("Her trunk's not her brainbox" [299.18-19]). Finally, Shem is forced to spell out the shape: "Hear where the bolgylines, Yseen here the punc ture" (299.19-20). The place of puncture (marked by P) is the opening to the canal, the extended figure resembling a Y (as in Issy's name). Because she is a woman, Issy recognizes the drawing as the map of female anatomy. Shem, understanding exactly how sons become fathers (and where "tots" come from); tries to tell an uncomprehending Shaun how it is done: "Like pah, I peh. . . . And as plane as a poke stiff' (296.28-30). When the brothers (designated here by the pi, the small "p") can write the capital P, they can mark sexual difference by dividing the vaginal canal with the "poke stiff." They will be able to write the woman's anatomy; the P will write (and right) the S of sexual difference. Because Shaun cannot read the writing of sexual difference (does not know where the "P" goes or how it becomes a capital), he cannot deliver the letter. The system insures that Earwicker's secret is safe by hiding the letter in the one place he would not think to look, a place he knows too well, and one he assumes can only be filled by him, a place that marks the very failure of the postal system to read woman's writing: ALP's vagina. Here the letter remains—unreadable because never delivered—hidden in the apostrophe of its language, a marker of the (missing) phallus and a sign of sexual difference. Residence in the delta, the midden, has sub jected the letter to a series of transformations, however: Heated residence in the heart of the orangeflavoured mudmound had partly obliterated the negative to start with, causing some features palpably nearer your pecker to be swollen up most grossly while the farther back we manage to wiggle the more we need the loan of a lens to see as much as the hen saw. Tip. (111.34-112.2) Life on the midden has produced stains that are read as signs, a chemical historical process that melts, merges, and mutilates, producing the "negative" from a "positive" and blurring distinctions between marks and their meanings. A second text emerges as a negative of the first, its defining feature a stain (teastain or watermark), the signature of woman's complicity in the writing act and sign of her violation by the pen(is). The signature works within the negative, overturning the feminine "affirmative" and disarranging the sexual alphabet (pp/qp; 1/y). It is also evidence of an effort to subjugate, appropriate, and gain authority over and silence the Other, to remake the Other as a shadow or reflection—as in a mirror—of the "self." As this struggle for authority affects the letter, the message is altered so that its signature, the sign of its possession, is obliterated—that is, it is opened to any who might read the letter. The signature is missing, its blank space overlaid by the mark—a "teastain 606 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="21">(the overcautelousness of the masterbilker here, as usual, signing the page away)" (111.20-21)—usurps and effaces the name. Every member of the Earwicker family "signs" the letter as it appears in Book 1.5: Earwicker by the teastain, Issy with her "four crosskisses," Shem with his title ("Shem the Penman"), and Shaun in the postal stamp that pays for the letter's delivery ("P. P. M"—postage prepaid in money [131.03]). The multiple "signatures" proclaim the absence of a singular possession, each covering the blank space of it signatory (where Anna Livia's sign is ex pected) in such a way that all marks of possession are put into question. The letter belongs to no one and to everyone, its violation occuring under the "closed eyes of the inspectors" (107.28-29) of the postal system through which the letter circulates. Writing in the Wake holds secrets and poses riddles whose answers rest (rather literally) with woman. Efforts to decode the female body, through various forms of transcriptions and translation, reveal a masculine blindness to sexual difference. For instance, Shem's triagonal inscription of woman (293) provides no entrance to the hiding place where this secret writing inscribes itself under the protection of the hymen. The hymeneal fold is marked in Shem's drawing by overlapping circles, which suggest both the virginity of this text (its inaccessibility) and the potential for viola tion at the point where it can be penetrated. In order to expose the secret text, to deliver the letter and deliver up its message, the woman's body must be violated. In fact, it must be twice violated because the letter is twice concealed, hidden first internally, where it is protected by the double fold of the hymen, and then concealed by the "everydaylooking stamped addressed envelope" of the "feminine clothiering" (109.31) that covers the female body. Discovery of the message involves first stripping the woman (writing and reading are forms of "secret stripture" [293.F2]), then penetrating her body. Reading, therefore, constitutes a kind of rape, a desire to impose authority and uniformity through violence, to ap propriate the secret at all costs, to expose a textual/sexual vulnerability. "Form" is broken in the effort to extract "meaning" from the text, emptying it, making it bleed, and erasing, effacing, blanking out, or "rewriting" certain of its forms and norms. Submitted to the light of day, rescued by the reading process from its dark hiding place, the letter is rendered transparent. The hymeneal veil that supports "sin" and "sign" as double signatures of dream and letter, each bearing the mark of the other, is broken. As a cultural text, woman's body carries meaning but does not pro duce it: patriarchy inscribes the female body with the pen(is). Her body produces "tots" rather than "thoughts": "Where did thots come from?" (597.25) the Wake repeatedly asks. Excluded from culture, woman nonetheless insures its continuation by her "nature," her ability to give birth. From earliest times in Western culture, woman has lived within BENSTOCK 607</page><page sequence="22">domestic enclosures, her language a derivative and domesticated form of man's language, rendered banal and utilitarian. Jean Bethke Elshtain writes of ancient Greece: [Plato] argued that the private speech of the household, the speech of women, lacked either the form of philosophic argumentation or the form of poetry. It was, therefore, without meaning—unformed, chaotic, evanescent, the speech of doxa (mere opinion, not truth). . . . The women of Plato's time were not only excluded from politics but also debarred from participating in the process of becoming what Plato meant by a "good" human being—a process that required a special search for truth within the all-male forum for philosophic discourse, pedagogy, and intimacy that is the mise en scene for the Platonic dialogues. (606) Finnegans Wake repeats this tradition, whereas Issy's actions subvert it. In the Lessons chapter, for instance, her commentary appears in a form belonging to philosophic argumentation and scholarly erudition. The con trast between this standard notational structure and its subversive sexual content, however, explodes the scholarly pretensions of the chapter itself. As I have argued elsewhere, the notes form a narrative commentary of their own. Moreover, they give voice to feminine laughter, a jouissance of language, that splits open academic, phallogocentric discourse.9 These notes constitute an apostrophe to the domestic, to female sexuality, to "private" speech, to "illogic" and "chaotic" energies. They also reveal the daughter to be "worldly wise," at least within the family world. The themes of incest and sexual seduction echo throughout the notations, hint ing that the daughter has the "goods" on her father's lusty attentions. Evidence of Issy's knowledge can be found in the relation between the subject matter of the text and the form, of the footnotes, the spelling of words containing clues to the father's presence, and echoes of a linguistic byplay indicating that the notes are double-voiced. The notes are not a narrative (although they can be rearranged to create a story line). Rather, they elucidate the complex relations among internal parts of the text, first adding a third voice to the dialogue of the brothers (a triologue), then doubling the notational voice to create a quartet—or, textually, a chiasmus X- This cross-structure, whose center is an impasse, is also found in the dream, whose origin in the waking world can never be identified.10 At certain (crucial) points, the notes divide, like the voices of the washerwoman in Book 1.8, where the women rubbing away at the stains on Anna Livia's drawers are aged incarnations of Issy's divided ego: 9See "At the Margin of Discourse," which also examines other aspects of notational form and structure in the history of fiction writing. ,0Ellie Ragland-Sullivan writes of desire and its relation to dreaming: "Desire is the 'pensee' at 'the base of the dream—what remains after the analysis; the analysis, that is, of the dream itself. This is a very important technical limit. . . . Desire cannot be chased beyond the navel of the dream into the Real nor beyond the primordial signifying chain of repressed representations" (13). The structure of the dream as a "navel," a place of former attachment to an outside, an other, which—when cut and tied—becomes a knot that cannot be undone, is not unlike the figure of the chiasma or the effect of the apostrophe. 608 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="23">'What's that, ma'am? says I. !As you say yourself. 'That's the lethemuse but it washes off. 4Where he fought the shessock of his stimmstammer and we caught the pepettes of our lovelives. (272.F1-4) These notes are keyed to a discussion of the family—"Pappapassos, Mammamanet, warwhetswut and whowitswhy" (272.5-6)—including father, mother, two sons who are at odds with each other ("war whetswut"), and a daughter with an as yet undifferentiated personality ("whowitswhy"). The text presents a riddle for identification of the family members in their recurrent incarnations through history: "But it's tails for toughs and titties for totties" (272.6-7), in which the "toughs" are the brothers, the "titties" their sister. This line echoes "teems of times and happy returns," which initiates the theme of historical return in new guises. The process of naming, attempting to identify and discern per sonalities behind roles, is a theme carried through the parallel structure of the notes, a game played throughout the Wake. The game acknowledges linguistic slips between word and referent and hints at threats to phallogocentric and patriarchal powers. Identity and its possible disguises are concerns of Issy's notational discourse, where the person addressed often maintains a shadow existence; she sometimes has a name—Maggy, Pipette, Laughing Sally—and carries forth identifications made earlier in her role as Issy's mirror image. These identifications retain their functions from previous contexts, so that Maggy appears in the reference to letter writing (recalled from Wake 111) in Issy's thank-you note for gifts: "Well, Maggy, I got your castoff devils all right and fits lovely. And am vaguely graceful. Maggy thanks" (273.F6). Pipette, even when not specifically named, is identified by Issy's lisp: "Pipette. I can almost feed their sweetness at my lisplips" (276.F6). Oc casionally, the person addressed is identified in the text to which the note is joined, as in "Dear and I trust in all frivolity I may be pardoned for trespassing but I think I may add hell" (270.F3). The "Dear" of this address is associated with Alice in Wonderland and her real-life counter part, Alice Liddell ("Though Wonderlawn's lost us for ever. Alis, alas, she broke the glass! Liddell lokker through the leafery, ours is mistery of pain" [270.19-22]). "Alice," "aliases," and "alas" conjoin in this reference to someone who is "lokker" through the "leafery," spying on the world of Wonderlawn. That "someone" is present in the next foot note ("He is my all menkind of every desception"): Lewis Carroll, the pseudonym of Charles Dodgson, whose "desception" amounted to spy ing on the world of young, nubile women (like Alice Liddell)—the very sin that HCE may well be guilty of in Phoenix Park. Lewis Carroll, like HCE, is "all menkind," introduced under the linguistic guise that offers multiple incarnations and reincarnations. The gaze belongs to the male BENSTOCK 609</page><page sequence="24">(Dodgson, a university don, was an amateur photographer), and "see ing" is "sinning." The young women who are the focus of the gaze are sexually sullied by the eye/I of the male. The Wake compulsively reviews and repeats the thematic and linguistic links between "sin," "sign," "sex," and "sight." The relation among the four terms is plotted across the scholarly text of Book II.2 (which incorporates four voices) and the female body (293) that superimposes two triangles and double circles. Issy's commentary on the drawing, and her own labeling of its parts, are particularly instructive. Unlike Kev (Shaun), she understands what she sees: "Draumcondra's Dreamcountry where the betterlies blow" (293.Fl). Her note includes a variety of sex ual puns ("con," "cunt," "butt," and so on), resounding a theme already set forth by the passage on which it comments, a passage that itself in cludes sexual wordplay. In the second footnote, she confesses to her alter ego Laughing Sally that her father is present (under the guise of "old Pantifox Sir Somebody Something, Burtt") and that she fears he will haunt her "for the rest of our secret stripture." The need to "see" and "sign," to identify and name, is the crux of the geometry riddle. The page begins with what looks like a name, "Coss? Cossist?"—Arabic for vagina—and goes on to ask, "You, you make what name?"), and the problem Dolph sets out for Kev is to identify the mother by her definitive parts: vagina and buttocks. While the buttocks can be seen, the vagina remains a dark hole that emits sounds. (Patriarchal powers and fears rest in phallic sex uell difference—the male parts available to sight, female sexuality dark, secret, and potentially subversive.) The marginalia that surround the draw ing do not provide the answer to the geometric riddle, but the alphabetical notations superimposed on the drawing identify a woman's parts, form ing the triangle delta, sign of ALP. The physical properties of this page are both different from and analogous to all the pages of Book II.2, a central strip of narrative sur rounded by the distinguishing marginalia. The imposition of the drawing at the center of the page, however, changes the internal relation of the text to itself, incorporating that which heretofore had been outside— linguistic signs differentiated for the reader by their manner of reproduc tion (print faces) and placement on the page. If we had forgotten, we are now reminded that this chapter's subject is relations and relativity, apparent in the subject matter of the children's lessons and visible in the construct of the textual surface. What we read here is the sum of various efforts to comprehend scholarly texts, to translate them into terms that are meaningful and relevant: what is relevant to Issy (as woman) is ir relevant to her brothers, and their different views merge only when the implications of the drawing are made clear. The process of notation on this page is intimately tied to the processes of reading and listening— incorporating facets of both written and oral production; the notes reflect 610 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="25">the very process that we ourselves enact as we read the chapter. Only when the drawing is labeled, identified, and defined (that is, translated into other terms, another language) are its implications removed from the general arena of signs and placed in a specific, gendered context. Issy's pun, "stripture," is highly accurate: woman is both stripped and scripted by this process. Kev is less quick-witted. He does not appear to recognize his mother's initials when they call out to him ("A is for Anna like L is for liv. . . . Tis perfect" [293.28-29, 33]), and thus he has to verify the "reproduction" with the original. Dolph obliges by drawing a pic ture of her torso, and Kev lifts her triangle-shaped apron, lights a match (to see better in the dark), and looks in awe: "fearfully! till its nether nadir is vortically where (allow me aright to two cute winkles) its naval's napex will have to beandbe. You must proach near mear for at is dark. Lob. And light your mech" (297.12-16). Once Kev has compared his mother's physiognomy with the draw ing, Issy draws the parallels: "Ugol egal ogle. Mi vidim Mi" (297.F2), which delineates equal angles, and remarks, "I see." Here as elsewhere, Issy sees. She refuses to be the object of man's gaze; instead she steals the gaze and sneaks into her father's dream to observe him watching her. Her notes have stripped and scripted this scene for us. It is on her com mentary that we rely (more than we might think) for corroboration, ex plication, extenuation of our reading. Without her notes, our relation to the text is distanced, obscured enough, perhaps, to prevent our "seeing." Issy focuses our attention on sexual difference, on the masculine desire for it and denial of it. She draws our eyes again and again to the drawing of the mother's vagina, which is here enclosed, impenetrable, without an entrance. When Kev investigates the vagina of his real mother, he discovers, of course, that it is open, that it emits both sounds and substances ("Waaaaaa. Tch! Sluice! Pia!" [297.17]); indeed, its very pur pose is to provide an entrance (and an exit), a place for penetration, an opening, an origin. The Wake narrative delineates all the possible substances that ebb and flow into and from this orifice: discinct and isoplural in its (your sow to the duble) sixuous parts, flument, fluvey and duteous, midden wedge of the stream's your muddy old triagonal delta, fiho miho, plain for you now, appia lippia pluvaville, (hop the hula, girls!) the no niggard spot of her safety vulve, first of all usquiluteral three ingles, (and why wouldn't she sit cressloggedlike the lass that lured a tailor?) the constant of fluxion, Mahamewetma, pride of the province. . . . (297.21-30) Issy's note to this meditation on tides of the vaginal canal is the comment that "Mahamewetma, pride of the province" includes "all meinkind," a conglomerate of "mankind," "my child," and—perhaps most importantly—"me in kind." That is, Issy in her body, in her female gender. BENSTOCK 611</page><page sequence="26">Her language is inf(l)ected by the metaphors of human sexuality that occupy the Wake and that her own discourse recuperates. Her notations retell the story whose ambiguous, amorphous, often repeated but never predictable history the Wake attempts to reconstruct. Her commentary provides links between the masculine world (with its concern for the past, first causes, origins, scripture, and reference) and with the more intuitive, visionary world of the woman whose purpose it is to generate, to pro duce, to give human life its origin. Issy repeats the terms of sexual dif ference, with a difference. The fault in Dolph's drawing of female anatomy is that he leaves no point of entrance in the geometric figure: it is a closed, encircled world—not unlike the hermetically closed world of scholasticism for which it is a property. The "entrance" to this world is provided by the woman, who herself embodies a point of entrance into historical and biological reproduction. Issy establishes relations, hints at origins, provides references, inverts hierarchies (taking over the narrative by establishing her own text), and takes the academic into the real, lived, experienced world. And in so doing she both repeats the actions of her mother (through whose vagina she entered the world) and anticipates her own originary powers. By repeating the story, translating it, telling it again, she lets us know that she knows the story, has access to the ambiguous and shadowy events that have led to humanity's downfall throughout history and that are now threatening to topple HCE. She doubles back on the story each time she comments on it, reinvesting it with the meaning given by her own perspec tive. This process is not instinctive: she learned it first from her mother, whose waters echo the story and whose "O" promises knowledge of origins and entry points, then from other women she overhears spreading the gossip, embroidering the action a bit further. Issy is Biddy the hen, scratch ing at the letter; she is the washerwomen, airing the Earwickers' dirty linen; she is the gossip who never reveals her sources and who takes great liberties with the facts. Issy is on the circuit of the apostrophe, where the E and A circulate; and her "lps" (lips) repeat the story. Her foot notes turn aside; they apostrophize. The movement of apostrophe problematizes the series of oppositions its doubling movement invokes: sound/silence, here/there, me/you, speaker/listener, internal/external, address/response, living/dead, presence/absence, and so on. Apostrophe resists and enforces these op positions even as it traverses them. It is the mark of difference, a dif ference within that precedes such categories and brings them into existence: apostrophe announces the silences within speech, providing in the an nouncement graphic evidence of the power of that silence: O! As a genre it calls out to the voice, which is represented through an image of voice, an image only available textually. Apostrophe undoes the effects of time 612 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="27">(including the end of all time, in death) by apparently enforcing something like a "timeless present," which Jonathan Culler remarks is "better seen as a 'temporality of writing' " (149). Apostrophe insists on a "now" that is impossible, apostrophe calling out to and also exposing this' impossibility. The action of apostrophe should exist outside writing; it makes claims to existing outside writing but its effect is to put into question the status of voice within writing. Apostrophe turns aside to insist on calling atten tion to itself, to its effects. These effects register the resistance to any kind of mastery. Apostrophe compromises systems, bodies (including the human body), origins, delivery points, and points of departure. It un does the structure of hierarchies and resists closure—this last a way of resisting the narrative drive from origin to closure. That is, apostrophe calls the question of genre to account. As a grammatical marker, apostrophe marks all that it cannot fully account for. Finnegans Wake also sketches out what cannot fully be accounted for and in so doing subverts accounting itself: it overstates, in a rush of words, letters, sounds, songs, all that cannot be stated as such. Narrative in general, not a specific genre, is called to account. The effort to tell the story, from beginning to end, with all false starts and loose ends carefully tied together under the generic imprint, "narrative," is undone by the turn (') of the apostrophe and the apostrophic turning aside. Finnegans Wake: a turning that confuses subjects and objects, waking and sleeping, borders and boun daries, definitions and explanations, genders and genres. Apostrophe, the mark of genre that marks the impurity and impossibility of genres. Apostrophe, an impurity that contaminates the pure sound of O, or the moment of pure presence, or the pure present. Apostrophe is at work even when cannot see it or hear it: Finnegan's wake. Finnegans Wake. WORKS CITED Attridge, Derek, and Daniel Ferrer, eds. Post-structuralist Joyce: Essays from the French.
