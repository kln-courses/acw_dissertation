Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract This article investigates the impact of transnational environmental organizations on rural people involved in conservation by exploring the impacts of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) ivory trade ban on Namibia's elephant conservation policy. This case study examines how rural African people are put into categories of'conservation heroes' or 'environmental villains' by local conservation practitioners, government officials in Namibia and transnational conservation actors. Findings indicate that the approach of state officials and conservation organizations (CO) results in incomplete repre sentations of both rural African people and the cultural importance these people attach to elephants. The article concludes that current environmental narratives associated with rural African people have been used as powerful 'tools of persuasion' at the state and international level to support and legitimate conservation policy and resource use in relation to the concerns of transnational environmental actors to the exclusion of rural African people.

E. Moore (El) Department of Politics, Manchester University, Oxford Road, Manchester Ml3 9PL, UK e-mail: moore.rainy@googlemail.com environmental actors (particularly international donor organizations and conservation NGOs) categorize rural African people as either romantic wildlife conservers (who live in harmony with their environment), or savage environmental destroyers (Brosius 1997; Neumann 1997; Goldman 2003, 2007; Forsyth and Walker 2008). Forsyth and Walker (2008) argue that both of these polarized categories are based on little evidence. Other authors highlight that these categories have their roots in colonial policy, where African people were seen as primitive by their colonizers (Neumann 1997; see also Leach and Mearns 1996; Adams 2003). However, Leach and Mearns (1996) state that these simplistic understandings of how rural people engage with their environment still exist today because colonial attitudes have become received wisdom (see also Adams 2003). This results in rural people's perceptions and knowledge of their environment being either misrepresented or dismissed (Brosius 1997; Goldman 2007; Forsyth and Walker 2008). These hero/villain categorizations remain powerful for two reasons. First, as Neumann (1997) points out, they enable international conservation actors to maintain their position of'gatekeepers' of local conservation issues in Africa (Neumann 1997; see also Brosius 1997). Secondly, the application of binary categories of heroes and villains to rural people has significant impacts on the direction and roll-out of conservation policies of high profile species and ecosystems. This article will argue for a nuanced analysis of the representations of rural African people in conservation by international, national and local NGOs, and the state. Interviews investigating the impacts of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) ivory trade ban on Namibia's elephant conservation policy led to two conclusions. The first is that international debate on the 'success' of the trade ban in fi Springer</page><page sequence="2">20_Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29 preserving Africa's elephant populations affects the way key stakeholders in elephant conservation express the roles and capabilities of rural people in Namibia's elephant conservation policy. The second conclusion is that this dichotomy is used to inform international debate associated with both elephant conservation and the role of people in conservation more widely. Local experts and conservation officials are not only instrumental in manipulating rural people's perceptions of their environment to legitimate conservation aims, but are also catalysts for the dissemination of these misrepresenta tions so that the received wisdom inherited from the colonial era remains unchanged. These simplified presenta tions of rural African people as heroes and villains are, to borrow a phrase from Brosius (1997), powerful 'tools of persuasion' used at the state level to support and legitimate conservation policy and resource use in relation to the concerns of transnational environmental actors. A key finding this article demonstrates is that the allocation of people to these two categories is fluid. People can be moved between the categories of hero and villain depend ing on how the causal explanations of environmental problems are framed and on the agenda of the practitioners/ experts involved. However, these simplified understandings will impact on species management plans, the level of access people have to their environment and how the history and voice of rural African people are recognized at both the state and international level. Elephants and elephant conservation in Namibia are important because of the internationally iconic and endan gered status of the species (Jackson 2003; Duffy 2003; Gronig and Sailer 1999), which invites a lot of interest from transnational environmental actors. Elephants are powerful conservation symbols to the Global North. They are, as Fortman (2005) argues, conservation 'Bambies.' Interna tional intervention in elephant conservation can be demon strated through the CITES ivory trade ban1 implemented in 1989 in response to rising international concern over the 'massive illegal trade in ivory causing dramatic declines in elephant populations throughout most of Africa in the 1970s and 1980s.'2 The universal ivory trade ban has been described as 'controversial' and has resulted in heightened international attention towards CITES. In particular, controver sy surrounds the extent to which the ban has resulted in the decrease of the illegal killing of elephants for ivory (for 1 However, a limited amount of sustainably harvested non-commercial trade is permitted through trophy hunting in range states that meet CITES conditions. In addition to this, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe were permitted to sell some of their stockpiled ivory to Japan in 1999 and November 2008. 2 WWF-International, WWF position Statement, 12th Meeting of the Conferences of the Parties to CITES, Santiago, 3-15 November 2002. www.panda.org/species/CITES accessed: 20.04.2004. differing presentations of the debates see Sugg and Kreuter 1994; Hutton and Dickson 2000; Sukumar 2003; Elliot 2004). The differing perspectives regarding the effectiveness of CITES and the ivory trade ban are seen in the two dominant conservation narratives: preservation versus utilization. Sukumar writes that 'the preservationist versus the utilitar ian approaches to conservation is perhaps nowhere as glaring as with elephant conservation' (2003:401, see also Sugg and Krueter 1994). Both approaches find fault with the operation of CITES in terms of both preventing and allowing small amounts of regulated international trade in ivory, and attribute declining or rising numbers of elephants to opposing factors. The preservationist position argues that any form of trade in ivory will be damaging to elephant conservation (McGlennon 1990; Leakey and Morell 2001), whereas the utilization position sees the trade ban as an obstacle to elephant conservation because it devalues the elephant (Sugg and Krueter 1994; Hutton and Dickson 2000). These two arguments have different implications for the elephant range states and the people who share elephant habitat. For example, communal involvement is more closely associated with the sustainable utilization approach to elephant conservation, whereas the preservationist approach maintains any form of sustainable utilization, including at the communal level, is unnecessary and immoral (see Fortman 2005; Furniss 2006; Lee and Graham 2006). Namibia is firmly placed within the utilization camp. It is one of four southern African range states actively campaigning to be permitted an annual export quota of sustainably harvested ivory as part of its elephant manage ment strategy. This has significant implications for the way local experts and conservation officials construct and anticipate local people's perceptions of elephants in Caprivi, which is in large part a strategy to legitimize an approach to conservation that is strongly opposed by many transnational preservationists, for example, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Born Free Founda tion and the Species Survival Network. Interviews I conducted with the people who share elephant range in Namibia provide a window into their own perspectives. The article is divided into six sections: methodology; an account of conservation in Africa outlining the development of preservationist and sustainable utilization models of conservation; a discussion of elephant conservation in Namibia, outlining how it is linked to Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM); an analysis of local conservation experts' understandings of people's perceptions of their environment and a discussion of how people in Caprivi actually perceive and value elephants drawn from interviews; the reasons for and implications of a disjuncture between state officials representations of people's perceptions of elephants and their actual perceptions; and finally an analysis of how international COs extrapolate from fi Springer</page><page sequence="3">Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29_21^ representations of locally held perceptions to legitimate preferred conservation policy at the international level. Methodology This article draws on a five month period of fieldwork in Namibia. I spent two months in the Caprivi region gathering information from each of the three study sites: from east to west, Kasika Conservancy, Kwando Conservancy and the villages of Chetto, Mashambo and Omega III of West Caprivi Game Park. The regional approach meant that different ethnic groupings and areas at different stages in regard to their implementation of CBNRM were encountered. For example, Kwando Conservancy was the first of the study sites to have obtained both government recognized conservancy status (1997) and a trophy hunting quota for elephants. The Kyaramacan Trust, on the other hand, received government recognition only in the later stages of my fieldwork. This is significant because it allows a comparison of people's attitudes at varying stages of involvement in elephant management. Methods included formal, informal and group inter views, story-telling, life histories and participant observa tion. I conducted a total of 110 interviews with government officials, international and national conservation NGOs in Windhoek and the people who share elephant range in the Caprivi region. Fifty-four of these interviews took place in Kasika and Kwando Conservancies, and West Caprivi Game Park. Interview length ranged from one to three hours, but repeat interviews were conducted over a number of days. Interviews and informal conversations were undertaken with both males and females and incorporated people from a range of ages including children, young adults, middle aged adults and village elders. Representations of rural people's perceptions of elephants and their role in elephant management were investigated by undertaking interviews with NGO and government officials in Windhoek and Katima Mulilo (in Caprivi). These data have been supplemented with archival research, policy documents, media sources and research on COs involved in elephant conservation. Multiple methods are employed by qualitative researchers to add 'rigor, breadth, complexity, richness and depth to any inquiry' (Denzin and Lincoln 2005: 5). In order to protect people's identities all interviewees are anonymous, but are distinguished through category of employment or place interviewed, and a respondent (R) number. Conservation in Africa Preservationist and sustainable utilization models of con servation are not exclusively associated with elephant conservation and form the two dominant models of conservation applied in Africa today. Preservation (some times described as "fortress conservation"), which has its roots in colonial policy, is the 'nature island' approach to conservation based on the view that 'biodiversity conser vation can best be achieved by creating protected areas where ecosystems are allowed to function undisturbed by human activity' (Neumann 2005: 129). Under such management regimes, people have traditionally been exclud ed from conservation, usually through the designation of national parks, which has had significant consequences to people's livelihoods and the environment. For example, Adams (2001) writes that African people were framed as the 'wrong kind of people' to occupy national parks and areas perceived to be wilderness by their colonizers (see also Brockington 2002), effectively framing them as environ mental villains. However, the 1980s saw the rise of a different kind of approach to rural people in the developing world in response to the impacts of fortress conservation on both the environment and rural communities in the less developed countries (LDCs). Sustainable utilization is informed by the need for people to have an awareness of the value of wildlife in order for conservation to be successful, whilst recognizing that individual countries and regions have varying conservation needs (Duffy 2000; Barnes et al 2002). Generally, sustainable utilization allows members of community-based conservation projects to utilize natural resources in accordance with quotas allocated by the government. Examples of these models include Campfire in Zimbabwe (Duffy 2000; Jones and Murphree 2001) and other CBNRM models in Botswana and Namibia (Ashley 1998; Twyman 2001; Barnes et al 2002) . Goldman notes that this transition from fortress conservation models to participatory, or community-based conservation (CBC) approaches, 'requires a simple shift in viewing local people as partners rather than enemies of conservation' (2003: 842). These understandings of rural African people as either conservation heroes or environmental villains are still applied by state and non-state actors today. Brosius (1997) describes how the Penan have been recast as conservation heroes by international conservation organizations due to their resistance to the logging industry in Malaysia, although the Malay government is reluctant to recognize Penan knowledge of the rainforests. On the other hand, in Tanzania Maasai are involved in conservation through a community-based project which recognizes their impor tance to environmental conservation; however their knowl edge of their environment is also ignored by the government (Goldman 2007). The reluctance of the respective governments to either acknowledge the potential environmental value of the Penan (Brosius 1997) or officially act on the pronounced knowledge of the Maasai Springer</page><page sequence="4">(Goldman 2007) would suggest that they and COs in each of these areas hold opposing perceptions of these groups as conservation heroes. Forsyth and Walker (2008) also describe how the land use practices of different hill tribe groups in northern Thailand are held as being either environmentally friendly or environmentally damaging by various government institutions and COs with little evidence to support these claims. These examples highlight one of the key themes in this paper: that rural people in LDCs can be both conservation heroes and environmental villains at the same time. Namibia's Elephant Conservation Policy Namibia's conservation policy is one of sustainable utilization applied at the national level (within national parks) through to locally-based communal and commercial conservancies. Both forms of conservancy attain government-recognized use rights over wildlife and other natural resources. This paper focuses on Namibia's com munal conservancies, which were permitted in 1996 through the amendment of the Nature Conservation Ordinance. This resulted in governmental devolution of 'conditional consumptive and non-consumptive use rights over wildlife' to registered 'conservancies' (Ashley 1998). In order to register, potential conservancies must be 'formed by a community, with a constitution, registered members, committees, and locally agreed boundaries' (Ashley 1998: 325). The rationale of CBNRM in Namibia was informed by the principle that people would have a higher regard for wildlife and value wildlife presence if they are involved in wildlife management that resulted in sustainable use, as discussed above. According to this approach, people sharing elephant range can benefit from elephant presence though the creation of communal conservancies. Because elephants in Namibia are a Specially Protected Species they cannot be hunted on communal land without permission from the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET). Permission is granted through CBNRM, where government-recognized communal conservancies with a viable elephant population can receive trophy hunting and own use quotas. Such conservancies also receive income from photographic or non-consumptive wildlife tourism. At the registered con servancy level, the aim of these tourism industries is to enable members of communal conservancies to receive benefits from conserving wildlife. Own use enables members of registered conservancies to use elephants for traditional/cultural purposes, for example feasts, if the conservancy so wishes.3 22 Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29 3 Interview with R4-MET, 10.05.06. The MET takes the firm position that in order for Namibia to maintain its free ranging elephant population, elephant conservation must be seen as a viable land use option among the people sharing elephant range. Indeed, the then Permanent Secretary of the MET has argued that because elephants have such well-defined corridors that cross communal land and established settlements, if they are not perceived as an asset by those who share their range they will ultimately face extinction in Namibia (Lindeuqe, M. 1997: 165). This sentiment was also expressed by interviewees.4 Namibia's reasons for proclaiming a need for a positive association with elephants are twofold. Firstly, elephants can be both dangerous and costly to live with (there are high incidences of human-elephant conflict in Caprivi). Particularly when elephant range becomes restricted in areas where human-elephant densities are high, elephants can impair livelihoods, cause injury and death. Therefore, sharing elephant range can be a frightening and traumatic experience. Sukumar (2003) reports the combined cost of damage caused by elephants in both India and Africa runs into several tens of millions of dollars per year. In addition, maintaining elephant habitat is in competition with other land uses that have greater direct value to both the people sharing their range and other potential land users. The MET extends its argument that people need to benefit from elephant presence by presenting the CITES ivory trade ban as an obstacle to securing long-term elephant conservation in Namibia because it has negative implications for elephant management at both the local and national level. Essentially, it is argued that the trade ban reduces the value of the elephant, which denies Namibia a source of income that could be reinvested in elephant conservation (Lindeque 2006; MET 2005). Namibia's Director of Scientific Services (MET) has clearly stated that: 'we have to look at mechanisms to address this problem [of human-wildlife conflict] and to make it possible for people to live with elephants. A ban will not achieve this in any way' (Lindeque, P. 2002: 34). A similar view was expressed by an interviewee who claimed that 'the trade ban makes life more difficult for the Southern range states. This is because there is a constant fight against other land uses within elephant range which results in the need to demonstrate that elephants are worth more than interviews with: R7-MET, 20.04.06; and R8-MET, 10.05.06. However this view has recently been put more strongly by the deputy minister of the MET: an article in the Namibian newspaper claims 'He said without a way of benefiting from elephants, elephants could only be seen as liability to rural communities, who lose significant crops and even human lives to elephants' (Shigwedha 2008). Springer</page><page sequence="5">Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29 23 millet, otherwise they will be excluded....Long-term, the trade ban in ivory means that the potential income from elephants is reduced.'5 However, this proclaimed need to benefit does cast human-elephant relations in Namibia's elephant range in a very negative light. The argument that elephants are a liability unless people receive material benefit from them suggests that if people do not benefit they will become conservation villains due to the CITES trade ban in ivory. This creates conflicting rhetoric regarding the success of CBNRM. On the one hand, the government is arguing that Namibia's elephant population could be threatened if Namibia is not permitted an annual (sustainable) export quota of ivory because people are not benefiting from elephant presence (despite the operation of CBNRM). On the other hand, CBNRM is often discussed in terms of empowering local people in the management of their environment and rewarding them for conserving natural resources.6 In addition, CBNRM as it currently stands has also been framed as assisting people to realise the economic value of elephants by the Director of Scientific Services, who has been quoted as saying, for example, 'within Southern African countries, the adoption and practice of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) has given elephants and other wildlife economic value' (Lindeque, R 2005/6: 6). Lindeque (2005/6) further argues that elephant conservation is now perceived as a land use option amongst these conservancies. This is a direct contradiction to previous statements maintaining that the trade ban in ivory prevents people realising the economic value of elephants and benefiting from their presence. The implication would appear to be that allowing sustainable and regulated trade in ivory could transform the people who share elephant range into conservation villains. However, framing elephants in such negative terms as liabilities (although understandable) does not tell the full story of people's perceptions of them?it does not significantly cover the complex sociocultural interactions people have had with elephants through history. Mixed and simplified statements of how people who share elephant range perceive elephants were also encoun tered during interviews held with local conservation experts and practitioners who claimed that people either 'hated' or ioved' elephants. For example, two interviewees who were employed by an international conservation NGO and a regional human rights NGO claimed that the people sharing elephant range hated the elephants and would like to see their permanent removal because of their destructive 5 Interview with R7-MET, 20.04.06. 6 Interview with CBNRM advisor-R50, 13.02.06 tendencies.7 Negative characterizations of how people who share elephant range perceive elephants have also been disseminated at the international level. Fortman argues that people who share elephant range are likely to perceive elephants as a 'giant hairless rat that destroys crops' (2005: 202). On the other hand, a locally based practitioner in Caprivi claimed that the people sharing elephant range 'loved' the elephants. These statements were somewhat surprising to me because my own research in Namibia suggests that people's perceptions of elephants are far more complex than these binary categories of love and hate. In particular, evidence indicates that elephants have a very complex status among the people who share their range in both Namibia and other African elephant range states (Ross 1992; Richards 1993). These negative characterizations have become entrenched at the policy level in Namibia. Making the argument that elephants can only be seen as a liability to rural communities unless they benefit from their presence is very negatives?it suggests that these elephants have no intrinsic value to people. To further explore this simplification of people's perceptions of elephants at the local level I will draw on the representations of how local people perceive elephants by two interviewees who work for COs in Namibia. The first is a utilization advisor employed within an international conservation NGO based in Windhoek, asserting that people 'hate' the elephants and will henceforth be referred to as 'local conservation expert y\ The other interviewee is a locally based practitioner from Caprivi, asserting that people 'love' the elephants, and will henceforth be referred to as 'practitioner x'. Conservation Heroes or Environmental Villains? Perceiving Elephants in Caprivi People value elephants for a variety of reasons. However, their actual perceptions of them are very complex. To begin with analyzing people's perceptions of elephants, inter views conducted with residents in each of the study sites revealed that the interviewees had conflicting emotions regarding elephants. These emotions included anger, fear, awe, respect, and admiration in addition to concerns regarding the damaging aspects of occupying elephant range, regardless of whether elephant presence led to economic benefit. This was demonstrated through the responses of West Caprivi interviewees, who at the time of research were yet to receive any benefits from elephant presence. The complexities of interviewees' feelings were revealed in their multi-faceted descriptions of elephants. 7 Interviews with: R23-Humanitarian NGO, 06.04.06; and R14 International conservation NGO, 31.01.06. fi Springer</page><page sequence="6">24 Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29 Some did appear to contradict themselves regarding how they felt about the elephants, sometimes in the same breath. Examples of these contradictions included lengthy discus sions associated with negative attributes of the elephant, followed by statements of how upset they (the interviewee) would be if the elephants were removed. In response to being asked how they would feel if the elephants were removed, one interviewee said 4 it would be bad because we conserve them, which means in the absence of elephants we will not conserve anything.'8 However, it was not uncom mon for a condition to be expressed within this reluctance to see the permanent removal of elephants. For example, interviewees indicated that elephant presence would be greater tolerated once ploughing had been completed. Other contradictory statements included 'we like the elephants even if they do destroy our fields because they have value and if they could compensate our loss we would like them overall...Elephants are not so friendly because they can trample, and they can take you with their trunk and beat you against the tree.'9 This plurality of feelings regarding elephants was noted by the interpreter employed in Kwando Conservancy, who remarked that 'the farmers were confused, because while they say they will not feel good if the elephants are gone, they complain when they damage their crops.'10 Only one interviewee out of all people consulted in each of the study sites claimed to dislike the elephants and wanted to see their permanent removal because he feared them and they destroy vegetation. In response to being asked how he felt about the elephants he said 'I do not like the elephants. They destroy vegetation, the crops and the trees. Buffaloes are better than elephants. I am scared of the elephants; everyone is scared of the elephants: even you!'11 This is a unique and significant response because none of the other interviewees provided straight yes/no answers to questions regarding their feelings towards elephants, but rather provided answers containing elements of positive and negative themes. However, despite this complexity of people's perceptions of elephants and the reluctance to see the permanent removal of the elephants, discussions regarding the negative charac teristics and behaviour of elephants were very common during interviews. Elephants can cause great damage in a very short space of time. It is not surprising that discussions with interviewees elicited negative perceptions of elephants closely associated with fear driven by the potential or actual experience of crop depredations, injury and loss of life. Six interviewees highlighted the problem of crop raiding when 8 Interview with R113-farmer, Kwando Conservancy, 1.05.06. 9 Interview with Rlll-farmer, Kwando, 30.04.06. 10 Interview with R108-Kwando Conservancy, on-going between 30.04.06-02.05.06 11 Interview with R84?farmer, Kasika Conservancy, 04.03.06. asked the very general question: 'can you tell me about the elephants?' In addition, negative elephant-related behaviour can induce people to change their patterns of land use.12 However, although the fear of elephant-related deaths is very real, the actual incidence in each of the study sites is low. Only two deaths had been reported in the space of a year in both Kasika and Kwando Conservancies.13 As this discussion demonstrates, it is difficult to allocate interviewees' thoughts, feelings and perceptions of the elephants to categories of like and dislike as claimed by local conservation officials. In addition, it is very difficult to simplify or categorize the reasons why people place a positive value on elephants. Box 1 lists the varied reasons for wanting the continued presence of elephants. Box 1. Reasons interviewees gave for liking and believing they should continue to occupy the land I do like the elephants. God brought them here (R84-Kasika). I do like the elephants?if I see an elephant walking close to the village I get the children and they say 'what is that?* and I say 'it's an elephant' (R98-Chetto). I do like the elephant. Some people do not know the structure of the elephant and when I can show them and before they go back to their country they shake my hand (R87-Kasika). It wouldn't be good if the elephants were not here. We depend on the elephants to sell for tourism?for the tourists to see the elephants and for the next generation. When the elephant stops coming how will they know what an elephant is? (R86-Kasika). Research undertaken in Caprivi contradicts the claim of local conservation expert y that rural people hate elephants, and practitioner x that all rural people love elephants. Nor does it provide evidence to support the MET's claim that preventing people from benefiting from sustainable trade in ivory will make them perceive elephants as a liability. Elephants are clearly valued for a variety of reasons: material benefit was mentioned by interviewees, but so was the intrinsic value of elephants. Elephants are valued because members of the conservancy can sell them to trophy hunters, but they are also valued because "God put them on the earth," or because "they have a heart and are reliable."14 The importance of non-economic values to people sharing elephant range is demonstrated strongly in West Caprivi, where interviewees also valued the existence of the elephant and did not want to see its permanent 12 Farmers R89-Kasika Conservancy; R103-Omega III, R70-Kasika Conservancy and R88-Kasika Conservancy claimed that they no longer farmed; see also IRDNC and CI 2003. 13 Interviews with: R108-Kwando Conservancy, ongoing between 30.04.06-02.05.06; R70-Kasika Conservancy Management Commit tee, ongoing between 28.02.06-08.03.06; see also IRDNC and CI 2003: 4. 14 Interview with R108-Kwando Conservancy, ongoing between 30.04.06-02.05.06. fi Springer</page><page sequence="7">Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29_25 removal, despite not having received economic benefits from elephant presence. The Local Implications of Simplified Categories Simplifying peoples' perceptions of natural resources, to borrow a concept from Neumann (1997), denies people their history. The act of categorising people's perceptions of elephants to love or hate, or making the claim that people will perceive elephants as a liability if they do not benefit from their presence, does not tell the full and rather complicated story of people's relationships with elephants, which has historical and cultural significance to many Africans. Jackson (2003) describes how elephants were perceived and valued as living animals and a natural resource. These values can be divided into socially constructed perceptions (e.g., majestic, religious, mystical, charismatic); and per ceptions derived from 'real' encounters and uses of the species (e.g., strong, frightening, entertaining, product of wealth or sustenance, ecological function; see also Ross 1992; Gronig and Sailer 1999). Elephants also have important ecological functions, such as the dispersal of seeds in their dung, and the clearance of dense forest and shrubbery which can assist people in moving to create farms and settlements.15 However, elephants are also social beings and are represented through human imagination (see Ross 1992). My fieldwork suggests that people in Namibia do value the ecological function of elephants and ascribe cultural and religious values to them. One of the most common reasons interviewees did not want the permanent removal of the elephants was that the elephants had occupied the land before them, or at the time of their forefathers. People explained that because God put the elephants on the earth, the people should not remove them.16 They also explained that they wanted their children to grow up knowing them.17 It was common for interviewees to ascribe anthropomorphic values to the elephants, which suggests that the elephants are also valued because the interviewees feel they can relate to and understand them. This was alluded to in statements such as 'the elephant has a heart'; and 'they are understanding.' Indeed, this theme appears in other parts of Africa as both Richards (1993) and Ross (1992) highlight. Interviewee data from Caprivi indicate that these traditional values associated with elephants do exist18 15 Interview R112-Kwando Conservancy, 1.05.06. 16 Interviews with Kasika Conservancy, 04.03.06. 17 Interviews with Kasika Conservancy, 04.03.06. 18 These values do exist, although partially. Events during Namibia's colonial history, particularly the war for Independence with South Africa has had a destructive impact on people's traditional values and knowledge associated with elephants. See Moore (2009) for further information. despite the growing expectation of material benefits from elephant presence. This is also recognized by a regional MET employee who said 'the elephants are still valued for cultural reasons, but communities are beginning to focus more on the economic values now.'19 However, despite this recognition of the growing emphasis of material benefits, state policy, local and international COs largely miss this sociocultural relationship between humans and elephants, which does have an impact on how people perceive and value the elephants they live with. Denying or failing to recognise these perceptions is significant because it will result in misunderstanding the way in which rural people see, understand and make sense of the world around them. It will also prevent rural people from being fully repre sented in debates that influence their lives and suggests that little has changed since the colonial era. Obviously it is unclear if the interviewees who presented such simplistic representations of rural people's perceptions of elephants were consciously motivated to simplify a complex relation ship. It is not uncommon for local people's knowledge of their environment to be simplified or discounted in this way. Goldman (2007) notes that the Maasai, like the Tanzanian government, have a keen interest in tracking wildebeest movements. Although the government recruits Maasai as scouts to assist in tracking wildebeest, they are not interested in understanding or adopting the methods used by the Maasai; nor do they believe the Maasai hold important knowledge of their environment. There are many other documented instances in which conservation officials and experts ignore the knowledge people have of their environment because rural people are treated as homoge nous groups (Neumann 1997) or are out of favour with the government (such as the Hmong in Thailand; Forsyth and Walker 2008). However, categorising people as heroes or villains by simplifying the way they perceive their environment can be a strategy by which officials and COs maintain control over environmental issues (Peluso 1993; Neumann 1997). Indeed, this desire to maintain control and legitimatize a preferred conservation policy can be seen in the back grounds and motivations of practitioner x and local conservation expert y. For example, practitioner x, who asserted that people iove' elephants, spends more time with the people sharing elephant range than do the experts and officials based in Windhoek. As a result, practitioner x spends a great deal of time working on CBNRM in Caprivi assisting people in conservancy creation and teaching them how to manage the conservancies. Practitioner x's claim that people iove' the elephants and are thus conservation heroes may well assist in portraying CBNRM as a success 19 Interviews with R9-MET, Caprivi Region, 10.03.06. fi Springer</page><page sequence="8">26 Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29 story (which practitioner x would have great interest in doing). Local conservation expert y, on the other hand, is a utilization advisor who supports the government's position that elephants need to be perceived as a competitive land use option in order to ensure their survival. As such, local conservation expert y is in favour of resuming sustainable trade in ivory. Arguing that the people "hate elephants" suggests they will become environmental villains unless they receive material benefits from elephant presence. Both interviewees may have ulterior motives in framing rural people's perceptions of elephants in the way that they do. The creation of these dichotomous categories enables the advocates of both sustainable utilization and CBNRM in Namibia to present contradictory statements regarding the success of their particular elephant conservation strategy. On the one hand, Namibia's elephant conservation strategy and CBNRM is presented as a success, while on the other, the CITES ivory trade ban is presented as a hindrance to this strategy. This has significant implications at the international level as transnational actors advocating either preservationist or utilization models for elephant conser vation extrapolate from the experience of individual elephant range states to legitimate their own preferred narrative that informs international debate surrounding elephant conservation. Conservation Policy and Transnational Environmental Actors The claim that iocal communities' do not have any interest in the long-term conservation of elephants because the elephant has no value to them is widely expounded by advocates of utilization-based approaches to conservation (see Barbier et al. 1990; Sugg and Krueter 1994). These groups also highlight the ability of the southern African range states (Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe) in maintaining successful elephant conservation through utili zation programmes (Sugg and Krueter 1994). However, Lee and Graham argue that the negative language employed by the advocates of utilization (e.g., 'conflict, pests, compen sation, valuing resources or commodities') is hostile and powerful because such descriptions of elephants 'firmly places people in control of the outcomes of interactions, whether or not conflict actually occurs' (2006: 9). This is significant because Namibia and other pro-utilization advocates use the problem of human-elephant conflict to justify lifting the ivory trade ban. On the other hand, advocates of preservation argue that even some of the range states are very concerned about the impacts of any trade in ivory on their elephant populations. Representatives from the wildlife authorities of 19 African states at the Elephant Symposium,20 held in Ghana, August 2006, called for all elephants to be relisted on Appendix 1 of CITES and for a total ban on international ivory sales (Furniss 2006). Preservationist approaches to conservation place people firmly at the centre of Africa's elephant conservation problems. International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) attribute West and Central Africa's declining elephant populations to Moss of habitat due to unplanned expansion of human settlements leading to increased human-elephant conflicts, and poaching for the bush meat and ivory trades.'21 Similar themes are also expressed in an IFAW Human-Elephant Conflict fact sheet, which explains that aggressive behaviour of elephants towards humans and human settlements is to be expected because people have encroached on their land. IFAW's fact sheet also explains that elephants have witnessed poaching and culling of other herd members, which is also likely to make them aggressive towards humans. IFAW state that 'humans need to be mindful and understanding of the elephants living around them. The problem lies in that individuals have not reconsidered encroachment into elephant habitat, and have not taken elephants into account when making decisions regarding land use,' Therefore, IFAW propose to increase elephant habitat through mega parks and trans-frontier conservation areas.22 Advocates of preservation see utilization as unethical and unnecessary. For example the Chief Executive of the Bom Free Foundation has stated that 'the truth is, however, that the ethical, social and biological problems associated with trophy hunting far outweigh any positive contribution the industry can possibly make.'23 In addition, he has been cited as arguing that sales of sustainably harvested ivory would generate very little income. With reference to the 1999 stockpile trade of 58 tonnes of ivory from Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe to Japan which generated an income of US$5million, he said that: 'if you compare the proceeds that each country received from the sale with the cost of protecting elephants from ongoing, high levels of poaching?which may well be stimulated further by these sales?I suspect you would end up looking at a significant net deficit' (cited in Furniss 2006: 53). Similar arguments were presented in recent newspaper articles covering the second legal ivory stockpile sale, which took place in 20 For more details see http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx? oid= 177893; http://www.save-the-elephants.org/news.asp?linkID= 35&amp;articleID=1544&amp;rYear, accessed 2.12.08. 21 'Africa's Elephants Must be Saved', www.ifaw.org accessed 2.12.08. 22IFAW Human-Elephant Conflict fact sheet http://www.ifaw.org/ Publications/Program_Publications/Elephants/asset_upload_ file30_12031.pdf, accessed 2.12.08. 23 Born Free position statement on trophy hunting http://www.born free.org.uk/campaigns/further-activities/trophy-hunting/ accessed 2.12.08. fi Springer</page><page sequence="9">Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29 27 Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe between 28th October and 6th of November, 2008 (Berger 2008; Mokgata 2008). Concern has also been raised regarding the suitability of CBNRM that allows sustainable use of elephants. This is because community-based utilization 'may encourage a pattern of wildlife 'use' that in the absence of meaningful institutions will be unsustainable' (Lee and Graham 2006: 15). Advocates on both sides make use of simplified but highly political arguments that have clear implications for the different elephant range states, but more importantly for the people who share elephant range. This is because policy using such simplified arguments affects the terms on which people gain access to natural resources. Preservationist approaches vilify people who engage in CBNRM pro grammes that incorporate sustainable utilization. Utiliza tionists, on the other hand, aim to make heroes of local people by involving them in elephant conservation; however they also paint a very negative picture of human-elephant relations if people are prevented from benefiting from elephant presence through sustainable use. Both the preservationist and utilization campaigns attempt to claim legitimacy by arguing that they are applying elephant conservation policy as chosen by 'Africans.' McGlennon (1990), argues that Africa took the lead in the ivory trade ban. Kenya, Tanzania and other elephant range states lobbied for an ivory trade ban due to high levels of poaching. However, a closer look at who orchestrated the ban reveals a complicated network of local and global actors. Both the UK and the USA banned the import of ivory before the international trade ban was agreed on (Huxley 2000). Utilization advocates are keen to point out that the southern African range states' desire to re open trade in ivory is due to the difficulties these states face in mitigating human-elephant conflict due to their large elephant populations. These different approaches are both advocating policy based on judgments regarding how the elephants are perceived by the people who live with them, but are also informed by the concerns and preferences of people who do not live with elephants. Claims are made by state officials and local and international COs that they are implementing policy that meets the concerns of rural African people when in reality the concerns of rural African people are either misrepresented or misunderstood, so that their perceptions, concerns and preferences regarding natural resource use are entirely absent at the international level. By portraying communities as heroes and villains, people and policy are used as a device to impact a wider conservation agenda. Local people are not involved in this dialogue: their perceptions are assumed. This results in the perceptions of transnational environmental actors such as local conservation expert y, practitioner x and the preser vationist lobby (e.g., IFAW), prevailing. Conclusion By categorizing people's perceptions of the environment, local experts and policy makers can mould their narrative of how people engage with and perceive elephants to legitimate a conservation aim. Presenting people as ele phant 'haters' who want their complete removal reinforces the argument that elephants need to be perceived as an asset among the people who share their range. This approach is also used to argue that the trade ban in ivory should be removed so that the benefits reaped from elephant presence can be maximized. On the other hand, romanticizing people who share elephant range as elephant iovers' demonstrates the success of CBNRM and policies designed to make people perceive their environment as an economic asset. Framing CBNRM in this way enables the Namibian government and non-state actors who are advocates of utilization conservation strategies to further demonstrate to the international community the need for elephants to be perceived as an economic asset by rural people. Therefore, the prevalence of simplified representations of how rural people perceive their environment is associated with state and non-state actors' strategies to legitimate their conser vation agenda whilst retaining control of natural resources. This is because simplified representations of what is taking place on the ground create leverage at the international level, which is helpful when preferred policies meet international resistance. Namibia and the other southern African range states wishing to employ an elephant conservation strategy based on sustainable use face a powerful lobby. There is a lot of resistance to reopening trade in ivory. Therefore, Namibia's categorising of rural people as either heroes (involved in CBNRM and assisting with elephant conservation) or potential villains (disliking elephants and unlikely to want their continued presence if they do not benefit from them materially) is a result of the wider tendency for transna tional environmental actors to use simplified representa tions to legitimate preferred policy. After a period of time, these simplified representations become accepted as ortho dox truths. Powerful lobbies that employ environmental narratives as orthodox truths to advocate specific conser vation strategies of individual species or ecosystems push state officials and representatives of COs that have a stake in managing these species to create similarly powerful orthodox truths that further reduce people's perceptions of their environment. However, the very act of reducing these perceptions results in the simplification of people and their cultural heritage associated with environmental resources. This is fundamental: the way people perceive their environment informs how they come to know, understand and engage with their environment. If the people's environmental fi Springer</page><page sequence="10">28_Hum Ecol (2010) 38:19-29 perceptions and cultural heritage are not acknowledged, or are misrepresented, people can be denied both the voice and the opportunity to be represented in key debates affecting their lives. This raises questions for conservation based on communal units, but also for the role of international environmental actors and debates that impact on the conservation of species and ecosystems. With regard to CBNRM, Alcorn (2005) argues that more time and resources need to be employed at the local level to ensure that people who live with managed resources are listened to. The importance of this argument is illustrated by elephant management in Namibia; it cannot be assumed that trophy hunting and allowing legal sales of ivory will make rural people perceive the elephant as an asset and ensure the long-term conservation of elephants in Namibia. This could simply be due to rural people's preferences for elephant management being different to that of the govern ment's, or because people do not equate revenues from trophy hunting as compensation for elephant related damage. In order to highlight the international implications of environmental narratives that simplify rural people's per ceptions of their environment I will return to Neumann (1997), who argues that using environmental narratives in this way maintains the position of COs (and state officials) as 'gatekeepers' of local conservations issues, effectively obscuring the politics of natural resource management (including elephants or land). However, my research shows that the ability to obscure natural resource management of such a high profile species as the elephant also demon strates the power local experts have in extrapolating from their localized representations to influence species manage ment at the international level. I agree with Brosius (1997: 53) that these simplified representations and narratives have the ability to become powerful tools of persuasion as they filter through different domains of actors and users from the local to the global level. This adds further weight to the argument that value-laden assumptions and narratives that exclude local people's perceptions are feeding international policy decisions. This is significant because it is clear from my analysis that the ways preservationist and utilization advocates of elephant management represent rural people and their role in elephant conservation is based on little evidence, particularly scientific evidence. Both approaches use powerful symbols to legitimate their conservation aims, i.e., cute elephants under threat from people who want to kill them for their ivory; or poor African farmers who have nothing to eat because an elephant raided their crops.
