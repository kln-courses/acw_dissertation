Beane THE COSMOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF MYTHICAL TIME: KALI-8AKTI Durga-Kali is the theistic manifestation of a widespread concept in Indian religion called sakti, or the religion of power. As the goddess (Devi) she is regarded as both the mistress of timelessness and life and the arbitress of time and death. Being the object of devotion of a major denomination of Hinduism (i.e., the Saktas), this divinity is best understood within the framework of Tantric- Puranic belief and practice. There she becomes the integrative focus par excellence for a remarkable homologation of religious myth, cult, and symbols. These phenomena in turn constitute an integration of structures, at once cosmological, soteriological, and eschatological in nature, which provide an almost unique opportunity for significant religious understanding. Although the soteriological (Kali-Piija) and eschatological (Kali-Yuga) aspects will not be treated here,1 this essay aims at pointing out the 1 For the structural homologation of Kali (the goddess), kala (time), and Kali-Yuga (the "last age" in an interminable series of ages), see Mircea Eliade, Images and Symbols (London, 1961), pp. 64-65. The soteriological structure, which I have treated elsewhere (see my "The Goddess Durga-Kali: The Structural Unity of Myth, Cult, and Symbols" [Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1971]), may take the form of equinoctial festivity and Tantrayogic activity which are, respectively, homologized with the ambiguity of the goddess (Kali) and the great time (Maha-Yuga; Maha Kalpa). Ultimately, there is continuity and correlation between cosmic time and ritual time, mythic event and sacred space, as well as sacred reality and sacred action centered around Kali as the great goddess (Mahadevi). 54</page><page sequence="2">History of Religions potential mutual coinherence of the previous structures as the phenomenological components of a universe of religious meaning.2 Their aspectual convergence is thus symbologically implied in the cosmological structure alone (Kali-8akti), but most notably under the form of the cosmogonic-mythic event. However, it is essential to recognize that the meaning of the end as phenomenal creation and spiritual liberation is given in the experience of the beginning as absolute power.3 In order to delineate her univalent, ambivalent, and multivalent character (using a few selected texts), the following discussion will emphasize the rubrics of cosmogenesis, devigenesis, and cosmoredemption. For not only are these rubrics correlative to her form, nature, and activity, but they are also three dimen- sions of one ultimate sacred reality. COSMOGENESIS THE FORM OF THE GODDESS: MAHADEVI The goddess Durga-Kali appears within a historical-phenomeno- logical perspective to be the structural and functional successor to the creator (Brahma) of the traditional Hindu Trimurti. Yet there is another sense in which this creatrix would seem to explode even that trimufrtian structure. For in her most exalted and pictur- esque mythology this divinity supersedes in authority and resplen- dence all the forms of the gods (devas) as well as the (great) lords (zsvaras), especially Visnu and Siva. However, the paradox is that the history of the goddess and her manifestations remains inseparable from the historicity of the human beings who worship her. Accordingly, when we speak of the form of the goddess (i.e., particularly as abstraction), we are bound to acknowledge a perennial historical and religious truth; that is, man's irrepressible 2 This paper presupposes the phenomenologicosymbolic integrability of the Sakta dargana and Sakta-oriented mythologies into a cosmological whole. It is decisively the concept of Brahman which allows for our use here of a hermeneutical monism; see Philip H. Ashby, "The History of Religions and the Study of Hinduism," in The History of Religions: Essays on the Problem of Understanding, ed. J. M. Kitagawa (Chicago and London, 1967), pp. 150-54. It is this whereby various and sundry mythic episodes find an integral place in the overall Sakta cosmology; so that though a mythic episode or cycle, such as Durga-Kali versus Mahisa, might be regarded, alone, as noncosmogonic in structure (see S. N. Kramer, ed., Mythologies of the Ancient World [New York, 1961], p. 124), it remains true that "the myth of the creation of the world does not always look like a cosmogonic myth stricto sensu" (Eliade, The Quest: History and Meaning in Religion [Chicago, 1969], pp. 75-76); also Patterns in Comparative Religion [Cleveland, 1963], pp. 412-13, 416). There is, then, a paradoxical coincidence of creation and re-creation as eschatological epic (e.g., Devimahatmya section of the Mdrkandeya Purdna) within the realm of the great goddess as a symbol of eternal time continuum, time embodiment, and time transcendence. 3 Agehananda Bharati, The Tantric Tradition (London, 1965), p. 18. 55</page><page sequence="3">Mythical Time: Kdlz-Sakti sensitivity to form,4 even when he insists upon speaking of the ultimate reality as itself the formless: "The Devi, as Para-Brah- man, is beyond all form and guna. The forms of the Mother of the Universe are three-fold. There is first the Supreme (para) form, of which, as the Visnu-yamala says, 'none know.' There is next her subtle (Siksma) form, which consists of mantra. But as the mind cannot easily settle itself upon that which is formless, She appears as the subject of contemplation in Her third, or gross (Sthula), or physical form, with hands and feet and the like as celebrated in the Devi-stotra of the Puranas and Tantras" (italics mine).5 Indeed, with Durga-Kali, as also other Hindu divinities, the Vedantic-Upanishadic type of perception of the goddess as (either the wife of, or) the Para-Brahman is seldom, if ever, found to divorce itself radically from the morphic vision of her as the macroanthropic feminine (i.e., feminanthropos).6 Her devotees, therefore, tend to confirm their irrepressible sensitivity to form per se,7 in that she is often textually portrayed as having at least, fundamentally, an ultimate form (formlessness, i.e., to the un- initiated)8 and an intimate form, which is accessible to men of faith through iconic or aniconic contemplation. In this regard it is interesting to notice that the gods themselves cannot know even the wonderful cosmic form of the goddess without the personal extension of her grace (anugraha), to the comparative depreciation of practically all other modes of pleasing her except loving devo- tion (bhakti).9 4 See Ernst Cassirer, The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, vol. 2, Mythical Thought (New Haven, Conn., 1959), pp. 83, 90. 5 Sir-John Woodroffe, Introduction to Tantra &amp;dstra, 5th ed.

Her devotees thus extol her theologicometaphysical greatness and grandeur beyond all con- templatable divine forms (devas, Zsvaras). Paradox, nonetheless, prevails because, on the one hand, man's visualizations of the omnisacred still tend to be correlative to "sensuous-spatial exist- ence," the contingency of form; and, on the other hand, the "mythical-religious intuition" allows for the multivaluation of pro- fane existence1--here, for the Sddhaka vis-a-vis the goddess, the whole of reality will be seen to be characteristic of cosmic anthro- pomorphism. For, as the Para-8akti, the goddess is the power beyond powers; she thus constitutes the abyss of power as tran- scendental form. The goddess, therefore, remains a mystery to all those who have not sought to grasp the truth of what it is to have the power of sacred existence in the world. The abstraction of time: Adyakali.-As that form (-lessness) which it is not possible for the profane mind to imagine, grasp, or reach, the goddess is noncreative power. She is predynamically the unmanifest, the primeval, and the supreme Prakrti. She is the ultimate transtheistic symbol of timelessness-the not-time,12 whose unmanifested and primordial supranature merit her the name of Adyakali. In her most transcendental status as the prim- ordial goddess, this divinity possesses a fundamental aseity,13 that is, she is (a) without beginning, (b) without attributes, and (c) without contingency. With a sense of inquiry which calls to mind the question of revelational continuity once asked by a forerunner's disciples, "Art thou he that should come,"14 another seeker after the vision of ultimate truth asks, then, the goddess, "Art thou the Brahman, the one and the secondless ... mentioned in the Vedas? ... Kindly solve this doubt of mine . .. Whether Thou art male or female. . . So that, knowing the Highest Sakti, I be freed from this ocean of Samsara."15 10 See Winston L.

To be sure, the testimony of a Rishi to a king is that the goddess "is beginningless" and "there- fore ... that Highest Devi is Eternal and ... always the Cause of all Causes."16 Being absolutely beyond the opposites of phe- nomenal existence the goddess proclaims that "when everything melts away, i.e., there comes the Pralaya or general dissolution, then I am not female, I am not male, nor (am I) hermaphrodite."17 The primeviality of the goddess is again affirmed as a prelude to her epic confrontation with demonic powers (asuras). She, as Chandika, is declared to exist eternally. Her eternal existence is lauded in that she is not only the foundation of the universe, but once it is established she also maintains and protects the world. In fact, in words that suggest a panentheistic imagery, the traditional creator-god, Brahma, extols her as "thou who contain- est the world." She is, therefore, the queen of the universe, and is the eternal world-soul which resides in everything.18 That absolute ultimacy whose divinity as supreme form remains formlessness is affirmed by the goddess herself in words that also reveal the limitations of language for men and divinities:19 I resemble in form Brahman ... from me emanates the world which has the Spirit of Prakriti and Purusha I am empty and not empty, I am delight and non-delight I am knowledge and ignorance,20 I am Brahman and not Brahman, I am the five perishable and imperishable elements I am the whole world I am the Vedas and not the Vedas ... I am not born and am born21 I am below, above, and horizontal. Besides her eternity (beginninglessness: Devi Sandtani), another dimension of her fundamental aseity is attested to by the affirma- tion that the goddess is beyond the forms (attributes) of the 16 Ibid., 5,33,55 ff. 17 Ibid., 3,6. 18 Mrkandeya Purana 81, 47, 56, 63; cf. verses 49-73. 19 Devi Upanishad 1-3, cited by G.

Perhaps the paramount (though not the only) textual testimony of this distinctive aloneness of the goddess22 is found in a delightful text of the Tantric-Saktic tradition, the Saundaryalahari (flood of beauty).23 This artistic textual adoration of the goddess, which W. Norman Brown calls "a great work of religious literature,"24 is cherished by followers of both the Daksinacara and Vamacara in the Hindu Tantric tradition. The goddess in the text is portrayed as the one supreme being of obsessing beauty. She is there the ultimate mysterium fascinans. This is the text in which the goddess truly comes into her own. Whereas other texts which regard her highly-not excluding the DevTbhdgavata Purdna-tend to include multiple theologico- metaphysical structures, in the Saundaryalahari it appears that the cosmogonic and the cosmoredemptive are brought together in uniquely striking fashion amidst an outpouring of poetic adulation. Here the cosmogonic and cosmoredemptive are merged in personalistic-pantheistic imagery on behalf of a divinity who is ultimately perceived as an eternal ground of supraconscious being. In the Saundarylahari we seem to move beyond the rampant dualistic-monistic tension of the Devimdhdtmya,25 as well as the erotic, paradigmatic duality-in-unity of the Kdlikd Purdna,26 toward the radical structure of a theologicomystical monism.

Srinivasa Ayyangar, The Saundaryalahari (Madras, 1965). The complete text has three parts: (1) "Anandalahari" ("Wave of bliss"), verses 1-41 (this single portion trans. Arthur Avalon [John Woodroffe], Anandalahari [Wave of bliss] [Madras, 1961]); (2) "Saundaryalahari" ("Wave of beauty"), verses 42-99; and (3) a "final stanza," verse 100. For origins and analysis of content, see Brown, p. 1; also Sastri and Ayyangar, pp. v-xv. 24 Brown, "Introduction," p. 30. 25 The goddess, it seems, even in this textual mythic magnification, is not yet elevated radically beyond male divinities who have lingered, some old, some originally latent (e.g., Visnu), well into the time of the epics and puranas. For in the Devi-M&amp;hatmya she is still "the perfect form of the powers of countless Devas." Nonetheless, the goddess is portrayed in paradoxical relation to such powers (see Arthur and Ellen Avalon, trans., Hymns to the Goddess [Madras, 1964], pp. 111, 112 (hereafter cited as Hymns). 26 See below, pp. 76 f. 27 All square brackets are those of the translator (Brown). 59</page><page sequence="7">Mythical Time: Kdlz-Sakti you are an ineffable fourth [beyond these three], hard to reach with power unbounded [by space, time, cause and effect, substance], O great power of creation (mahamaya), O wife of the supreme brahman (Sadasiva), you put the universe through its revo- lution of appearances.28 However, in keeping with our former remarks on the irrepress- ible human sensitivity to form, it must be recognized that the monism which belongs to the goddess in the Saundaryalahari is, finally, a cosmic anthropomonism or an anthropocosmic vision of ultimate reality.29 Through his spiritual perception, then, the Sakta Sddhaka realizes that the periodic great dissolution (mahd- pralcya) may occur through the mere closing of Devi's eyes,30 at which time even the Trimurti is obliterated. The mystery of form and nonform is complete: whatever the goddess as the eternal form does not see (i.e., acknowledge as acceptable to her) does not exist. To be sure, her mere glance heals (renews), 31 which confirms that she has the power of sat and asat-being and non-being. The goddess without contingency is paradoxically presented to us, insofar as "she is the three great goddesses-Sarasvati, Laksmi, and Parvati,"32 while remaining the surpassing ground of their divine particularity. For when she is referred to as the "ineffable fourth," such a symbol does not simply point to her as another goddess, superior in beauty and power, or even the totality of the other great lords33 but, rather, the revelation of a unique dimension of being as boundless plentitude. In this vein such a vision is shared by other textual glorifications of her.

For the kundalinic development of the cosmos, see Saundaryalahari, verses 36-41. The cultic homologation occurs in that the goddess initiates the prototypical movement of sacred power as cosmological act (satcakrabheda) (see Mircea Eliade, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom [New York, 1958], pp. 241-45); while her devotees via imitatio dei seek to achieve tantrayogic mastery of cakra-movement by evolution or involution (see H. Pott Pieter, Yoga and Yantra: Their Interrelation and Their Significance for Indian Archaeology [The Hague, 1966], pp. 20-21).

Because Thou devourest Kala, Thou art Kali, because Thou art the Origin of and devourest all things Thou art called Adya Kali ... dark and formless, ineffable and inconceivable Thou alone remainest as the One."39 The shape of time: Mahdkadl.-"The mythical world achieves its true and specific articulation only when its dimension of depth ... opens up with the form of time." 40 That which is one, unmani- fest, and primordial before the time of creation41 is also the dy- namic Prakrti-the key to the unfolding of the universe as the great time and the appearance of the multitudinous array of life forms and natural phenomena; as one text puts it, her "wond- rously variegated universe."42 The goddess Durga-Kali is, then, cosmologically, soteriologically, and eschatologically related to the phenomenon of time as manifest being:43 (a) she, as Prakrti, is the source of being as time (Kali); (b) she, as Mahamaya, is the redemptrix of time as power (8akti); and (c) she as Mahakali is the destroyer of time as Siva (Kala).

Not- withstanding his remark that "the Sakta Tantra is not a formal system of philosophy (Darsana)," the author betrays an intense interest in attempting to distinguish the Saktivada approach to ultimate reality vis-a-vis other Indian systems (see Sakti and Sdkta, pp. 362-408, 705-17, and also The World as Power, pp. 19-22). 62</page><page sequence="10">History of Religions and the not-self. The supreme spirit of the Sakta scheme has inner differ- ences,52 though frequently we meet with ideas of salvation and oneness of the world, which remind us of 8arikara's more rigorous non-dualism.53 We have, first of all, the absolute Brahman; next, we have the determinate subject endowed with Sakti. Nada issues immediately and from nada bindu appears, and then the Suddhamaya. These five answer to Siva, gakti, Sadakhya, Isvara and the guddhamaya of the Saivas. The rest of the evolution is not different from the 8aiva scheme.54 In consideration of the foregoing schematization, we would call attention to two pertinent theologicometaphysical concepts as being singularly and coherently important to the cosmological structure of the Saktas. They are these: (1) the idea of Kali-8akti as a symbol of monadic multivalence (Maya), and (2) the idea of Kali-8akti as a symbol of diadic univalence (Siva-8akti). The idea of Kali-Sakti as a symbol of monadic multivalence was earlier intimated in the portrayal of the goddess as the flood of beauty and bliss, which envelops the Trimiirti, their Saktis, and all other beings. Moreover, in her distinctive dimension as the fourth reality, not next in but enveloping and beyond time,55 the contemplation of her divine creativity raises at once the question concerning the absoluteness and the relativity of the goddess as fact (essence) and expression (manifestation). Her divine aseity cannot, therefore, be separated from her cosmogonic activity; for "inseparability is the key word in Tantrism: inseparability of the absolute and the relative, of the divine and the human, and, by implication, of fact and expression."56 The goddess, then, is "the Absolute Spiritual Whole (Purna)," as much as she is also "the relative psychophysical whole (mayd)." 57 She is the one "who is pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss, as Power, who exists in the form of Time and Space and all that is therein, and who is the radiant Illumination in all beings."58 Being both the abstraction (incomprehensibility) and the shape (personification) of time, the goddess holds within herself the power (Sakti) which is also 52 See S.

Yet her self- exfoliation is a creative continuum, along which time comes into being only with the appearance of the heavenly bodies after the underlying constituents of the universe (tattvas) have evolved.59 Furthermore, her creativity as cosmic continuum presupposes the supersession of all the ordinary conceptions of the relation between cause and effect. The translogical whole (Devi) "does not cease to be the cosmic cause because it evolves as the universe its effect."60 A glance at certain synthetic but varying views regarding time in monistic (Advaita) cosmology reveals the following possibilities which aid in clarifying the role of the goddess as chronic multi- form: (1) "time is an effect (kdrya) of avidyd or Mdyd like space . .., (2) time is not an effect of avidyd but is the relation between it and spirit or Brahman..., (3) time is identifiable with avidyd... (and, 4) time is an aspect (rupa-bheda) of Brahman itself."61 To begin with, let us note that the goddess as the personification of time through maya-8akti remains unchanged in her compre- hensive quintessence (sacciddnanda), and time as the exfoliation of that quintessence does not constitute a quantitative or qualita- tive reduction of her being as emanation.62 Thus maya, whose nature as measure has lured many to understand it as solely illu- sion, becomes more decisively in the Sakta cosmogonic world view the source of natural phenomenality and/or human delusion,63 as well as the redemptive milieu through which the goddess "as Liberatrix" delivers man "from the ignorance of the forms which are of Her making."64 In her capacity, then, as Mahamaya (i.e., the great measurer), the goddess Durga-Kali can be not only: "the Veiler even of the Creator, Sustainer and Destroyer of the World. But, fundamentally, She is ... the Whole Reality-Power both in Its veiling and revealing, binding and liberating aspect.... 59 Ibid., p. 407. 60 Ibid., p. 408; Woodroffe, The World as Power, pp. 339-65, esp. pp. 360-65; see also ibid.

Maha-moha, and as the Su- preme Revealer She is Maha-vidya. [Yet] in her aspect of Maya, She is, generally, described as the veiler, creating and drawing the veil over all particular existences."66 The significant thing to be grasped is that both of these cosmo- gonic desiderata (veiling and revealing) are integral to the crea- tivity of the goddess, that is, (JMahd-) vidya and (Miahd-) mayd are real 67 aspects of ultimate reality (the goddess). In this perspective, therefore: (1) time is not an effect but (like space, Dik) 68 a medium of avidyd; (2) time is not the relation between avidyd and Brahman (the goddess), but the empirical energy of Brahman as avidyd (maya); (3) time is thus a practical aspect of avidyd (i.e., "time as [a] Sakti [kriya-sakti],"69 of the goddess); but, again, (4) time is also an aspect of Brahman (the goddess) as a created (emanated, devolved) eternal continuum.70 Through and within her creative "chronicization" (Durga-Kali as time and times =yugas),71 there then emerges the variegation of her cosmic consciousness (cit) as multiform.72 Devolved forms of being, ranging from the dimensionalization of the heavens with their sundry beings; devolved forms of life, ranging from man to various microscopic and submicroscopic organisms, are manifes- tations of (and pervaded by) the goddess as Saccidananda-mayi.73 The world [as manifested in Time] is not something which has reality inde- pendent of Consciousness. It is the transforming and transformed Power of Sakti ... the Divine Mother of the Universe. The Mother as Material Cause ... is not thus, as the iamkhyas affirm, something unconscious.

Sakti is the Principle of Change and assumes the changing forms which constitute the universe.74 The conception of Kali-Sakti as a symbol of diadic univalence (Siva-Sakti) is particularly relevant both to the phenomenon of anthropogenesis as well as to the structural phenomenology of ritual time (Kali-Puja-Sadhana). To be sure, the relation between these two theological symbols (Siva and Sakti) has often been considered a subject of religiosymbolic and metaphysic curiosity. Our present purpose, however, is to emphasize the importance of them in at least two specific respects. First, not only is there the way in which they further illustrate some of the basic features of the cosmogony rendered above; they also represent the Sakta solution to the problem of the ontological homogeneity and creative differentiation of the cosmos.75 Second, there is the way in which such symbols (Siva-Sakti) suggest (a) the prototypical basis for the structural homologation of man and cosmos, as well as (b) a new phenomenological possibility-that such symbols represent a distinctive raison d'etre or raison de creer with regard to both cosmogenesis and anthropogenesis. A Tantric literary production which is frequently alluded to even by other texts and contains a description of Siva-Sakti in cosmogonic mutuality is known as the Kdma-Kald- Vildsa, that is, "the spreading or emanation or evolution of the Kamakala that is the Supreme Triangle of the Bindu and Visarga, of Prakasa and Vimarsa, of Siva and Sakti, of the 'I' (Ahah) and 'This' (Idam) or Universe ... the Siva-Svarupa and the Sakti-Svarupa." 76 Attributed by Woodroffe to a Tantric scholar, Punyanandanatha, and said to be a text of some (unascertained) antiquity,77 the Kama-Kald-Vildsa is a literary-religious portrayal of the divine diad (Siva-Sakti) through which is effected the phenomenalization of the ultimate reality as the universe (prapanca). The diadic motif, moreover, is correlated with the yantra par excellence, the Sri-yantra,78 which in turn is accompanied by both mysto- alphabetic and mantrayanic symbols, in order to schematize the basic features of the cosmogony which occur through changeless consciousness (cit, samvit) and changing power (cit-sakti, mdyd.sakti). 74 Woodroffe, The World as Power, pp. 356-57. 75 See above, p. 63. 76 Arthur Avalon [John Woodroffe], trans., Kima-Kald- Vilsa (Madras, 1961), pp. ix, x-xi, and verses 25, 39. 77 Ibid., pp. v, ix. 78 See John Woodroffe, Tantrardja Tantra: A Short Analysis (Madras, 1964), the frontispiece and pp. 1-14, esp. pp. 5-10; and Sakti and adkta, pp. 408-10. 66</page><page sequence="14">History of Religions The Siva-8akti symbolism illustrates, further, the process of cosmogenesis by, first of all, bringing to a focus the paradoxical problem of absolutivity and relativity mentioned earlier. They are, then, cosmic personifications of the macroscopic impersonal (Nirguna Brahman) and, as such, symbolize the creative process as being and becoming, cause and effect, power holding and power holder.79 In their Sagunic duo-form they are also cosmochronic personifications (i.e., Mahakala-Mahakali) which encompass the transcendent being of time as disinterestedness, satiation, and immortality, as well as the transcendent power of time which brings partiality, hunger, and death.80 Phenomenologically, there is an implicit or intentional monadic ambivalence in this diad which derives, ultimately, from their very nature as univalent being (Siva = Sakti). Accordingly, Siva and Kali-Sakti can be conceived as dynamically interrelated, so that whether in agamic-nyamic pedagogical relation, maithunic activity, or legendary tension,81 their ultimate (actual) unity remains structurally inseparable from their intimate (potential) disunity as a reflection of sensuous-spatial human experience. Moreover, this monadic ambivalence, though subsumed under the term "diadic univalence," includes a further devolvement to which we refer as "the ambivalization of the ambivalent"; that is, as distinct (sectarian) divinities, both 8iva and Kali are each ambivalent, benevolent, and malevolent in character. Thus, whereas the term "diadic univalence" refers properly to their metaphysical mutual identity, it is infrastructurally continuous with their singular sovereignty (as i4tadevatds) within time for good and ill.82 Finally, in a very specific sense, the former two broad dimensions-the ultimate and the intimate-are structurally mergent, insofar as the Siva-8akti symbolism is a cosmogonic metasexual prototype of the process of mundane procreation, that is, in their act of "now expanding and now contracting ... now entering and now separating from one another.... These two Bindus [Siva-Sakti] which enter one another and separate 79 Woodroffe, The World as Power, pp. 46-47, 143-44, 377, 385; Woodroffe and Mukhyopadhyaya, pp. 4-5, 24-25, 80-83; Avalon, Kdma-Kald- Vilasa 28. 80 Alain Danielou, Hindu Polytheism (New York, 1962), pp. 270-71.

For, if we allow that the Siva-Sakti diad represents the cosmo- logical Tantricization of earlier darsanic categories (especially the Sankhya's Purusa-Prakrti),85 then the Saktivada theory of Adrsta-Srsti86 raises a question similar to that concerning the consistency of Sankhya cosmology.87 Whether or not the literary opinion that the Skta ontology was designed "to establish unity amongst worshippers" has any historical validity,88 the iSkta approach to the metaphysic of an unmoved mover has its merits. Their solution to the problem involves again a theology of diadic univalence, that is, a theory of mutual reality-the inter- changeability of identity, power, and activity of the (two Sankhyan) primary ultimates: Purusa (8iva) and Prakrti (8akti). Posing, therefore, no original ontological independence of these primordial realities, the mutual reality of 8iva and 8akti required no addi- tional rational exposition of the eventual perturbability of the imperturbable (Purusa); for the mutually affective reality89 of Siva (Purusa) and 8akti (Prakrti) was not now preconceived with- out explanation of an implicitly necessary relation90 but took 83 I.e., Divya-darmpati-maya; hence, Siva-sakti-mithunapinda. 84 Avalon, Kama-Kald- Vildsa 6, 7; and commentary, p. 16. 85 Woodroffe, The World as Power, p. 46. 86 Woodroffe, Sakti and Sdkta, pp. 365, 378-80, 389-90; and "Creation as Explained in the Tantras," pp. 3, 14-15, 22-24. 87 See Radhakrishnan, 2:303 ff.; see "Pralaya and...

It is true, of course, that the Sakta duality-in-unity9l itself probably constitutes another philosophical enigma rather than an intellectually satisfying solution.92 But the answer to that also tends to be understood on the level of religious experience93 and is therefore as translogical (Woodroffe: "alogical") as that whole (Brahman = Sakti-Svaripa) which, apart from the initiated (Sddhakas), "none know"(s).94 Second, following our earlier statements, the Siva-8akti sym- bolism provides a prototypical basis for the structural homologa- tion of man and cosmos. To be sure, the relation between man and cosmos in Hindu religious thought has its possible intravarieties. A synthetic reduction of philosophic options, however, takes the form of the following three important causational variations: (1) "that which gives birth to an effect is a different entity ... [2] that which evolves an effect but of itself is one with it. .. [, and 3] that which gives rise to illusory phenomena in appearances without undergoing any essential change is the Para Brahman."95 In the first case, man might differ in form, nature, and activity from his ultimate source or being; although, if not in all these specifics, he might nonetheless differ in the quality of his ontological substance. He would, therefore, remain but a creature among creatures vis-a-vis his conception of ultimate reality as, perhaps, wholly other. 91 Woodroffe and Mukhyopadhyaya, p. 12: "Reality is a concrete unity in duality and duality in unity"; see Avalon, Kama-Kala- Vildsa, verse 11. 92 E.g., Woodroffe, The World as Power, p. 49: "Doubtless this doctrine does not explain how logically God can be changeless and yet change." 93 Ibid., pp. 42-43. The cosmological paradox is religiously experienced as spiritual integration or unification (Tantrayoga). 94 See above, p. 56. 96 See T. C. Rajan Iyengar, The Hindu-Aryan Theory on Evolution and Involu- tion (New York and London, 1908), pp. 1-7; see also R. C. Zaehner, The Comparison of Religions (Boston, 1962), p. 58, for a synthesis of the relation between cosmology and anthropology in the Upanishads. The ~akta viewpoint envelops basically all of these viewpoints (Zaehner), except that the universe is not illusory in the sense of "not-real"; and the affirmation of spiritual liberation, Sa'ham ("She I am"), it appears, confirms no "substantial" cosmological-anthropological heterogeneity, but, rather, reflects our earlier appropriate use of the term "cosmic anthropo- monism" (or else "anthropocosmos" and "makranthropy," via Tucci); see Eliade, Yoga, pp. 235-36.

At any rate, "the All-Pervading character [i.e., the imperishable sub- stantiality] would not then be the exclusive property of Para Brahman or God alone; but it would be the common property of God and Man."96 In the third case, the human being might be regarded as having no fundamental and distinct reality apart from the ground of his being (i.e., the Para-Brahman). Hence man's self (atman), when recognized, finally, as essentially and indistinctively the ultimate under the form of maya (illusion = delusion) would achieve its supreme self-realization: the mutual identification of the world, himself, and ultimate reality.97 Combining the latter two of the foregoing perspectives in its application of the principle of duality-in-unity, the Sakta anthro- pology understands man to be a theophany of the goddess as incarnate consciousness. Man, however, is a being of identical reality with the goddess, but only as a potentially liberated consciousness. The phenomenon of Sakta worship is in large part his soteriological endeavor to elevate his (ordinary) consciousness to the level of a supraconscious awareness of being: in, with, and as the goddess. This means again that man's phenomenal existence continues to hhve an ontological structural relation to the Siva- Sakti diad. For inasmuch as his lack of cosmic consciousness (supraconsciousness) tends to be typified, granting multiple levels of spirituality,98 by the perennial delusion of I-This-ness he is virtually caught between two realities-the world as ndma-rupa and his inner being as cit-sakti. Only the goddess knows that they are the same reality. Man, therefore, on the level of unliberated consciousness, remains a theophany of the goddess, but he appears to be an ambivalent entity-a being caught between the fact of being and the expression of becoming, the cause (his creator) and the effect (the individual as creation), being power held and a power holder 96 Iyengar, pp. 4-5. 97 Woodroffe, The World as Power, pp. 65, 153. 98 Woodroffe and Mukhyopadhyaya, pp. 149-50. A diminutive level of human spirituality might, of course, be equivalent to the "first case" (above, p. 69), i.e., perception of the goddess as "Wholly Other" (whom "none knows"). 70</page><page sequence="18">History of Religions (Saktimdn). Ideally and phenomenally, at any rate, just as to the Sakta ... the Mother of the world is a Divine Person, the Supreme "I" (Pu.rndhamh) in which all other limited Egos are .. .99 Man is three-fold as Spirit, Mind, Body.100 As Spirit he is Siva who, in Himself, is pure Consciousness. As Mind and Body he is Siva as Power, or "God in Action" or Sakti. That Power contracts consciousness in those subject to it.101 The same Power in the liberating aspect expands man's consciousness until it becomes infinite and one with Hers. Maya-Sakti is the Mother Herself as the World-Creatrix. Avidyd-?akti is the Mother in the form of man and all other beings and things. [Italics mine]102 The goddess is, moreover, specially and archetypically related to the female sex in essence and manifestation. "She is the Gem amongst women. ... Every female in every Universe is sprung from a part of Sri Radha or part of a part" ;103 that is, "the women of the world are descended from her digits. Insult to women is indignity to Nature [=Prakrti= Goddess]. ... Her digits are worshipped, particularly in the sacred land of India."104 "Each mother, whether of plants, animals, or men is the type of the archetypal Mother Goddess, Maha Devi, Maha-Mta."'105 On the whole, it is the foregoing cosmological and theological macranthropy, combined with a Tantric vision of the theandros possibilities in human nature, which provides the soteriological background for Sakta convictions about "the transformation of the human body into a microcosmos."'06 Such a vision is essential to the Tantrayogic worship of the goddess. Now the new phenomenological possibility to which we referred earlier concerns a cosmogonic intentionality hidden in the being and becoming of the goddess. Its factuality would seem to have been the dis- covery of the human spirit rather than the rational prefabrication of the intellect. John Woodroffe invites us to contemplate that Sacciddnanda-mayi as creation is love, that is, "the production of the Universe is according to the !akta an act of love, illustrated by the so-called erotic imagery of the Sastra.107 The Self loves 99 Woodroffe and Mukhyopadhyaya, Mahdmdya, pp. 147-48 and passim. 100 Woodroffe, The World as Power, pp. 137-38, 151 ff., 155 ff., 167 ff.; cf.

It suggests that there has persisted in the Sakta weltanschauung an anthropocosmic teleology which, though itself a great mystery, seems to bypass a classic problem of meta- physics as well as "the question as to how or why the original ignorance [Avidyd-Sakti] becomes operative," thereby making such an enigmatic question "by its very nature philosophically inadmissible."109 For in keeping with the sddhanic"ll quality of Sakta ontology, what remains incomprehensible at the level of discursive thought becomes an experience of the ultimately real in the union of Sakti and Sakta.

This creativ- ity has to do with the goddess as manifestation or emanation. For "I do whatever I wish1l ... What is real can only be born.... Thus ... there does not arise any inconsistency in My being every- thing."112 That is to say, "When she reveals herself in order to accomplish the purposes of the gods, it is then said in the world that she is born; [yet] she is also named the Eternal One."113 Birth for this deity, then, is not birth but manifestation-ten- dentious and responsive (i.e., invocational); creation for this being is not creation but emanation-purposive and (seemingly) involuntary.

The Goddess as tendentious manifestation.-This manifestation of the goddess occurs as a dramatic literary-historical prelude to other manifestations, under the form of that divinity who is both Brahmavidyd and mystagogue of the gods-Uma.115 The Fourth of Sankara's historical-religious explanations for the introduction of the goddess into the presence of the gods requires an additional hermeneutical perception;116 that is, the goddess as the "tran- scendentally beautiful" or "exceedingly resplendent" woman is intentionally possessed of a knowledge and wisdom of the truth. In phenomenological terms, then, that truth or essence of Sakta philosophy overshadows the other reasons rendered for her mysta- gogic theophany before the gods. Thus, in expulsive relation to other attendant descriptions (1) the gods, assuming that they possessed Brahmavidyd, knew it not, because they did not know the divine pedagogue par excel- lence for who or what she is-the one extremely near'17 the essence (the self) that is ultimate knowledge-permanent salva- tion. Hence (2) the self-sufficiency of the gods was found to be not real (asat), did not exist, and was not indeed the knowledge (vidya) which is the essence of Brahman.118 The gods, then, had acquired majestic superiority because of austere praise of Brahman 114 Suggested and preferred by Bharati, p. 212; cf. Eliade, Yoga, pp. 21-22. 115 See Kena Upanishad 3,11,12; 4,1-2; see Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God, vol. 2, Oriental Mythology (New York, 1962), pp. 204-5. 116 See T. M. P. Mahadevan's commentary in The Kena Upanishad (Madras, 1958), pp. 13-14. 117 Ibid., p. 36: "A being's excellence is to be measured by its nearness to God"; "Brahman is superior even to the gods ... it is the God of the gods" (ibid., p. 29). The Upanishad is probably not a Sakta Upanishad in literary intention (even if there were admitted any afkta influence). The goddess is not explicitly, but only implicitly, identified with the Brahman; nonetheless, her appearance "in that very space" (Kena Upanishad 3,12; 3,2) and her mystagogy suggest, strongly, a tendentious mythic phenomenology. See also S. Radhakrishnan, ed., The Principal Upanishads (New York, 1953), p. 589. 118 In the context, it is not that the victorious power of the gods (devas) was not indeed due to Brahman, but that they began to have undue pride in their epic conquest of the asuras, as if aseity were an ultimate possession, and the effective continuity of cosmic power an inherent attribute (see Eliade, Images and Symbols, pp. 60-62). Ultimately, then, their power was not any longer "real" or significant. For "the flash of lightning [see Kena Upanishad 4,4-5] does not stay for a long time. It appears for a moment and then vanishes.... Yet it reveals itself on occasions to those who have prepared themselves for its revelation" (Mahadevan, p. 38); Radhakrishnan, The Principal Upanishads, p. 591: "The sudden glimpse ... into Reality ... has to be transformed into permanent realization." 73</page><page sequence="21">Mythical Time: Kdli-Sakti (Indra excelling, Kena Upanishad: IV.3). However, they did not fully realize that the purpose of their possession of power lay not in the mere enjoyment of the fruits of their actions, it lay rather in the performance of even their "epic functions" in per- petual homage to the source of power, truth, and knowledge, "the Intelligence-Self which is their substrate."119 (3) Beings, again, whether men or gods, have no sui generis power to perpetu- ate their knowledge of Brahman even after an initial realization of it; for the eventual cosmic degeneration of time (i.e., Yugic fatigue) as well as the recurrence of Asuric ascendancy which threatens Deva-hood attests to the same. Finally, the hidden cosmic intentionality of the goddess's presence near Brahman thus brings together the phenomenology of myth and the history of religious valorization, insofar as there is in this eventful theophany an implicit, theretofore unrevealed motif of grace (anugraha), "the grace of Uma,"120 the goddess. Her presence is a revelation to both the gods and men (who study the acts of the gods) that they are to look to her121 for the sustaining knowledge of Brahma (Brahmavidyd). The element of conceit,122 then, reminds the contemplative mind of the need to accept the truth that all beings are to assume an attitude of humility on all planes of existence in the face of the supreme yaksa (i.e., Brah- man).123 The goddess as invocative manifestation.-The mythophenomeno- logical correlate to the former manifestation of the goddess appears in that primary text which bears the name-the Devi- bhdgavata Purdna. It presents us with another birth, or invocative manifestation of our divinity; again, it calls to mind the proper attitude which the gods are to assume toward the goddess as the incomparable being. The narrative constitutes a striking variation on goddess mani- festation; for here124 the gods are counseled by the ever-preserving Visnu to recall the chaotic world to order through "the sincerest devotion."125 The divine milieu follows upon the grief of Siva over 119 Mahadevan, pp. 8, 10-11; Devibhagavata Purdna 3,7,15a. 120 Mahadevan, p. 13; Radhakrishnan, The Principal Upanishads, p. 590 (bottom). 121 Devibhdgavata Purdna 1,1,1. 122 Kena Upanishad 3,2. 123 For the Puranic revalorization of this Upanishadic mythic allusion, see Devibhdgavata Purdna 12,8,8-93. 124 Devibhdgavata Purana 7,31,3-54. 125 Ibid., 7,31,3 ff., for the reversal of the harmony of creation: nature (including planets), gods, kings, and other beings. 74</page><page sequence="22">History of Religions Sati's demise.126 Turning their minds, however, to the crisis at hand (symbolized by Taraka, the Asura), the gods give themselves over to sundry sacrificial rites and gestures; they dedicate them- selves in the main to the Devi through the Purascharana Karma ceremony.127 By this and other attendant rites they seek to invoke the goddess into their midst.128 After many (divine) years of being implored, the goddess, who is "the Highest Light of the Supreme Powers," appeared at once before them "in the form of an exceedingly beautiful Divine Woman"; "the Mother Goddess, the Incarnate of unpretended mercy . . . ready to offer Her Grace, the Mother of the Whole Universe." The gods state their collective requests, but not before they have been inspired to tears by her, "the Enchantress of All."129 The goddess as involuntary creation.-Another account of the birth of the goddess, which one scholar has called an "involuntary creation,"'30 is told in a text devoted to her, the Kdlika Purdna. Without attempting to cite the myth in extensu, we notice in this text a stirring mythic code of the divine manifestation. Here the goddess appears under the form of Usas ("dawn")131 as erotic entrancement. She assumes the form of a divine being of irresistible beauty before the gods. Her enchanting loveliness subjects even the gods themselves to the cosmic illusion (mahamaya). The creative event is the first phase of what is a cosmoromantic biography of the goddess as Kali, the "dark lady." Set against a cosmological background of the incipient creation of the universe at the hands of Brahma, the event reveals a dimension of surprise in Hindu theogony because of the goddess.132 During the creative rehearsal of the great cosmogonic tradition, various and sundry beings and creatures pour forth from Brahma's abysmal Yogic trance as multitudinous embodiments, including other secondary creators (the lords of creatures). 126 Cf.

Before the god appears the most beautiful dark woman, stark naked, radiant, and vivacious. She is dawn, but she is erotic, entrancing dawn, the dawn of a new and incomparable reality and experience for those who gaze upon her. She laughs; for she knows who she is-the creatrix incognito-yet the greatest vision of reality.134 The event moves along until it centers around "the most important couple in the Indian pantheon, Siva-Kali"135 (the goddess now as Parvati). The other gods have consorts (or saktis, i.e., Brahma, his Sarasvati; Visnu, his Laksmi). However, there is much concern that Siva has taken no wife (i.e., Kali/Usas/Sati/ Parvati), for such a union has crucial implications for the nature and destiny of the cosmos as chronic rotation. The inducements of the god Kama ("love," "desire") 136 having failed, the austerities of the goddess under the reincarnate form of Sati provide the final attraction of Siva to herself.137 The cosmogonic significance of these portions of the myth (Kdlikd Purdna 1,1-5,10; 5,11-13,53) is not grasped unless it is understood that (1) the Trimurtian government of the universe (under creation, preservation, and destruction) lies in the inter- dependent performances of each of these three great gods- Brahma, Visnu, and Siva, without whom there can be no world or world process; (2) there remains and always will be an anticosmic (i.e., chaotic, disruptive) threat from titans and antigods (asuras) whom each member of the Trimurti (including the goddess [Mahamnaya]) will have to kill for the sake of the supernal order; and (3) each goddess: Savrti (Sarasvati), Laksmi, Usas (e.g., Durga-Kali) must play the role of the godly force (sakti)138 that both interpenetrates the Trimurti during cosmogonic activity and inspires the integration of opposites (coincidentia oppositorum)139 in an eternal cosmic romance. In behalf of this cycle of eternal 133 Ibid., p. 258, n. 2. 134 Ibid., pp. 241-42. 135 Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, p. 421. Despite her option to remain "alone" after Pralcya, Siva remains her preferred husband and lover. She chooses him-"again"-for instance, when Mahisisura first tries romantic wooing instead of marltial confrontation (Devibhagavata PurCdna 5,16 ff., esp. 5,16,35 ff.); elsewhere the goddess displays some interesting and alluring "femininity" (Ildrkandeya Purana 75,42-76, esp. verses 66-70). 136 Here he is "the incarnation of her spell" (Zimmer, The King andl thle Corpse, p. 261, the myth). 137 Ibid., pp. 269-71. 138 Cf. above, p. 60; also, see Devibhirgavata PurSna 3,6,28-85; 7,31,44-54. 139 E.g., below, p. 81. 76</page><page sequence="24">History of Religions return and responsibility for gods and men, Brahma bids Siva to take to himself "a glorious woman." 40 The goddess as purposive creation.-The distinctively purposive creation of the goddess is portrayed, finally, as under the onto- logical conditions of a cosmos turned once again to chaos. In a remarkable account in the Devi-Mahdtmya section of the Mdr- kandeya Purana, and which is paralleled in the Devibhdgavata Purdna,141 the cosmos has been threatened by the dominance of asuric powers who have confiscated "the Yajfias performed by the Brahmans." Indeed, the demonic forces have made the Devas "terror-stricken... and wandering in mountains and fastnesses." 142 Following an initial emanative gesture by Visnu, the preserver- of-cosmos, however, the other gods repeat his act in a concerted effort to transform chaos into cosmos. Unlike the Dev{-Mdhdtmya account, which makes their collective emanative activity appear as a spontaneous response to universal danger,143 the Devibhaga- vata Purdana renders an explicit account of this devigenetic phenomenon as a purposive creation: "Visnu ... spoke smiling 'we fought before; but this Asura Mahisa could not at that time be killed. Hence if some beautiful female Deity be now created out of the collected energy and form of the Saktis of each of the Devas, then that Lady would be able easily to destroy that Demon by sheer force.'" 144 Although the account of her effulgent creation is not radically different in either text in a comparative sense, the Devi- Mdhatmya's version of the anthropomorphization of the "Lady Deity"'45 seems to capture the imagination quite vividly: "The gods beheld the mass of intense energy there like a burning 140 Zimmer, The King and the Corpse, pp. 271-73.

Earlier indica- tions were that by the time of the Purdnas the meaning of the term asura (vis-a-vis deva) had become a symbol of the ontological polarization of the universe.147 That is, "the universe is in the visible form of a Daivdsuram conflict in which the Devas and the Asuras are locked in a trial of strength every moment and every- where."148 It is this cosmic-chaotic milieu which provides the background for, and which is symbolized by, the ultimate epic confrontation between the goddess Durga-Kali and the asura-of- asuras-Mahisasura, i.e., the buffalo demon.149 The battle myth.-In the two primary sources for this epic con- frontation, the Devimdhdtmya and the Devmbhdgavata Purana,150 we seem to be witnessing a magnificent, perhaps incomparable portrayal of the Indian mythological imagination at the cross- roads; that is, so much of the various and sundry mythological traffic of her religious past is brought together in a, to be sure, dramatic symbolization of the ambiguities that have characterized the spirit of prehistoric, ancient, and modern man. The Vedo-Brahmanic-Puranic continuity is specifically high- lighted with the divine rehearsal of the prototypical Indra-Vrtra episode, which, now, has become transformed into the Devi- Mahisa encounter.'15 Now with the goddess as the central theistic symbol of cosmic unity or unification, the "gifts of the gods" to 146 Markandeya Purana 82,11-12, 17b.

Creation and donation, therefore, are superseded by cosmic innovation, if not, indeed, the re- discovery of a theretofore unrealized secret: the essence153 of a sruti which has remained unchanged from the beginning.l54 The phenomenon of cosmic combat or ritual contest, though not confined to Hindu mythology,155 receives, perhaps, its most mind-boggling representations in India. In the case of the two foregoing texts, India's capacity for tortuous metaphysical and paradoxical symbolism is fully evident. For example, there is the presence of interspersed combative episodes in apparent cyclical relation to the main event-the cosmoredemptive action of the goddess as Durga-Mahisasuramardini.156 Such episodes are (1) "The Slaying of Chanda and Munda," and (2) "The Slaying of Sumbha and Nisumbha." 57 As cyclical phenomena, however, their relevance to the repetition of the cosmogony is suggested in the Skanda Purana by Candi's words to Siva: "0 god of gods! formerly I slew Chanda and Munda in battle, but they have been born again as mighty Asuras." 158 Combative episodes such as the foregoing constitute recurrent restorational events that are in keeping with the larger Hindu cosmological pattern of creation, dissolution, and re-creation of the universe; for the universe "is only one of an infinite series in which there is no absolutely first Universe."159 The goddess Durga-Kali, therefore, restores the cosmos into the hands of the gods as an act of eternal return as well as the redemption of time. She bids them to call upon her at liberty whenever the universe is again threatened or overwhelmed 152 Mllirkandeya Purana 82,18-31; Devibhigavata Purina 5,9,1-22; see Satapatha Brdhmana 1,2,4,1-7. 153 I.e., the goddess, see above, pp. 73-74. 154 Devibhcgavata Purana 1,1,3,6 ff.; lMarkandeya Prdnra 45,20-23.

In the latter half of the last century, while noticing that the goddess was called Prakrti ("nature"), Adya Sakti, or Maya, a writer posed the inevitable question: "Why should Nature, our common mother ... be portrayed as waging war with demons and not nursing her children with fostering care?"'161 Although we shall make no attempt to answer such a question here, there are certain structural observations to be made with reference to the general Sakta cosmology. It is, first of all, evident that we are witnessing in the battle imagery of the Candika-Mahisa episode a representation of the theological ambivalence of the goddess on the epic-cosmic plane.162 Let us recall with Eliade the pan-Indian vogue of this mythological bicharacterization.l63 To be sure, It is in India that the experience of the Terrible Mother has been given its most grandiose form as Kali, "dark, all-devouring time, the bone-wreathed Lady of the place of skulls." . . . In her "hideous aspect" (ghora-rupa) the Goddess, as Kali ... raises the skull full of seething blood to her lips; 164 her devotional image shows her dressed in blood red, standing in a boat floating on a sea of blood: in the midst of the life flood, the sacrificial sap, which she requires that she may, in her gracious manifestation (szmdara- murti) as the World Mother (jagad-amba), bestow existence upon new living forms in a process of unceasing generation.165 This paradoxical inconographic symbolization of the goddess Kali is the analogue to her nature as an evolving (i.e., devolving) polarity in the cosmic diad (Siva-Sakti), as well as the ambiguities that characterize all phenomenal existence. On the terrific side of her restorational activity she, therefore, both has "the visage of a fiend"'66 and performs her deeds with intermittent shouts that reverberate throughout the worlds and all of nature.167 Second, the goddess as epic stentoria reveals a structure of mythological activity which seems to correspond in its dynamic 160 Mdrkandeya Purana 84,31-32. 161 Ghosha, Durgd-Pujd (Calcutta, 1871), pp. iv, v. 162 See above, p. 67. 163 Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, p. 419; Mldrkandeya Purana 84,25 (cf. 91,36-40,45-46); Harivamsa 58,12. 164 Cf.

If in her self as anthropomorphic warrior goddess she has a peculiar diamorphic disposition, she also has the capacity for paramorphosis as well as infradynamic manifestation. Her activity is character- ized by paramorphosis168 in her encounter with the Asuras- Chanda and Munda-that is, "Ambika uttered her wrath aloud against those foes, and her countenance then grew dark as ink.... Out from the surface of her forehead, which was rugged with frowns, issued Kali of the Terrible countenance." 169 Her capacity for infradynamic manifestation occurs during the entrance of the saktis of the gods into the cosmic combat. It represents a unique development within the mythic narrative; for after the various saktis "went in the forms of those gods to Can- dika," she herself as a unique (collective) sakti born of the gods, emanates her own sakti! "Thereupon from the Goddess' body there came forth Candika's Energy, most terrific, exceedingly fierce howling like a hundred jackals" (italics mine).170 The triumphal advent of the warrior-goddess is a threefold phenomenon,171 which is paradigmatized in the Candika- Mahisasura conflict. Those triumphs are the following: (1) the "Battle against Sumbha and Nisumbha," (2) the "Battle against Chanda and Munda," and (3) the "Battle against Raktabija." 172 It is the struggle between the goddess Durga-Kali and the buffalo- demon Mahisasura 173 that has tended to symbolize the supremacy of the goddess. Of the Devi-Charitas the Madhyama Charita174 is, then, most significant in that the conquest of Indra by Mahisa- sura means both (a) the dethronement of the traditional martial prince among the gods, which symbolizes the supersession of the 168 The Mahisasura reveals a capacity for epic metamorphosis; see Miarkandeya Purdna 83,20, buffalo-shape; verses 28-30, lion, man-like, elephant; cf.

The unlimited metamorphic power of the goddess is strikingly exemplified by her capacity to assume even the form of "innumerable Bees" for the restoration of the cosmos from asuric powers: liarkandeya Purdna 91,47-48; Agrawala, p. 220. 169 Markandeya Purana 86,4-5; cf. verses 6,7; Neumann, plates 66, 67 (p. 153); Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia, vol. 2, plate 424. 170 Markandeya Purana 88,12b-13, 22-23a. 171 Excluding the Vishnu (Maya)/Madhu-Kaitabha episode (ibid., 81,49-77, esp. verses 68-69; 75,37-41), a "Voluntary Creation," as it were. 172 See above, n. 157.

Perhaps the most decisive (almost inconspicuous) illustration of her sovereign incomparability is the fact that the coup de grace to Mahisasura is preceded by a nonchalant kick of her foot176 for, in transepic, transcendental terms, she is no one power, but absolute power (Para-Sakti) tending to carouse with itself under the form of (re-) creation. A final testimony to the all-encompassing sovereignty of Durga-Kali recalls her designation as Mahamaya. For in this capacity it becomes clear, once more, that the goddess "in whom both compassion of mind and relentlessness in battle are seen,"177 turns out to be both "Mahadevi and Mahasuri, i.e., Supreme Power of the Devas and of the Asuras .... In the Universal both exist together."178 The creation (emanation) of a new universal order means the destruction of chaotic powers for the (re-) established dominance of cosmic power (Maha-sakti). The goddess destroys, then, only the apparent evil in the universe of divine, human, and natural life. The epic triumph of Mahadevi over Mahasuri (asuras) as an integral dimension of the cosmogony, therefore, requires that cosmogenesis, devigenesis, and cos- moredemption be understood as unifiable aspects of one kind of mythic event (not one episode), as well as one ultimate sacred reality. The cosmological structure thus includes a monistic sub- stratum of reality: the absolute, the Para-Brahman, the unknown, or the mysterium tremendum. This Urgrund is, as it were, the referent of all symbolic forms, dispositions, and activities of the many divinities; and it helps to explain how it is possible for asuras (e.g., Mahisasura) to gain great powers through the Isvaras (Brahma, Visnu, Siva) and, thereby, use such powers against the powers of light (devas)-indeed, the isvaras themselves. In the Vamana Purdna, for example, the text tells us that through "a boon granted by Siva, Mahisa had been rendered invulnerable" 175 See Devibhdgavata Purana 1,1,19-25. 176 The "Foot-Motif" plays a prominent role in Bana's "Candistaka"; see G. P. Quackenbos, "Bana's Candistaka," The Sanskrit Poems of 3layura, Columbia University Indo-Iranian Series, vol. 9 (New York, 1917), pp. 247, 251 ff., 267 ff. 177 Mcrkandeya Purana 84,21b; Brahmavaivarta Purana 2,1,91: "Fight with the demons for the preservation of the world is mere child's play to her." Like- wise, vis-&amp;-vis the 2i15rkandeya Purana, wherein the goddess has an army (e.g., 83,20 ff.), the Devibhagavata Purdna (5,10,1 ff.) depicts her as one who can destroy the arch-demon "without any army." 178 Agrawala, pp. 181, 182; cf. Eliade, Mephistopheles and the Androgyne (New York, 1965), pp. 88-89. 82</page><page sequence="30">History of Religions (italics mine); 179 while in the Skanda Purdna it says that Chanda and Munda (enemies of the goddess in the Devimahdtmya) were asuras who "became through a boon granted them by the divine mothers, so powerful as to subdue the three worlds. The gods in consequence implored the assistance of Devi." 80 Cosmologically, the significant point here is that, though the boons granted have apparently some providential basis, one can hardly avoid the impression that, once attained, such boons of power have some perpetuity of their own, even if it is not unlimited.181 Nonetheless, this means that such power, once achieved, must have some ground against which the power of the asuras becomes an ir- reversible plentitude of being-that is, nonretractable power. Power, however, may be superseded, but it must be met with more power. Yet we also discerned a dualistic cosmic structure which looms in the case of the devasuric conflict; and it is this structure which corresponds to a distinctly ambivalent quality in the character of the goddess. Because of its radical function in myth, cult, and symbols, it has been called the mysterium horrendum. It is especially pronounced in the bloody and fierce drama (or activity) of Durga-Kali as the martial guarantrix of the cosmos against the recurrent threat of chaos. In one sense (e.g., Mdrkandeya Purdna: Devimahdtmya) a greater destructive energy, power, and force (mahd-sakti) is launched by the gods (devas) against acosmic powers (asuras) but, in another sense, the latter powers are overcome not by another greater power so much as by the power behind all powers-Kali- sakti-the very essence of ultimate reality.

The mythological tradition thus shows that Mahisasura in fact became invulnerable to Siva himself. 180 Ibid., p. 338. 181 See above, pp. 73-74 and n. 118. 83</page></plain_text>
