<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARTRY H. FIELD MENTAL REPRESENTATION* Any interesting version of materialism requires not only that there be no irreducibly mental objects, but also that there be no irreducibly mental properties: the idea that although people and certain higher animals do not contain any immaterial substance, nonetheless they have certain mental properties that are completely unexplainable in physical terms, is an idea that very few people who regard themselves as materialists would find satisfying.1 The unsatisfactoriness of postulating irreducibly mental properties is the source of the two main problems in the philosophy of mind. The first and more widely discussed problem is the problem raised by experiential properties, for instance the property of feeling pain: a materialist needs to provide a believable account of such properties accord? ing to which those properties are not irreducibly mental. The second prob? lem, raised by Brentano,2 is the problem of intentionality. Many mental properties - believing, desiring, and so forth - appear to be relational properties: more precisely, they appear to relate people to non-linguistic entities called propositions. So any materialist who takes believing and desiring at face value - any materialist who admits that belief and desire are relations between people and propositions - any such materialist must show that the relations in question are not irreducibly mental. Brentano felt that this could not be done; and since he saw no alternative to viewing belief and desire as relations to propositions, he concluded that materialism must be false. The first half of this paper is an examination of Brentano's problem - that is, of the problem (which Brentano believed to be unsolvable) of giving a materialistically adequate account of believing, desiring, and so forth. Unlike Brentano, I take it as unquestionable (given what we know about the world) that materialism is true; I also take it as unquestioned for the purposes of this paper that people do believe and desire. These two assumptions together amount to the assumption that Brentano's problem can be solved; what I shall be interested in is the question of how it can be solved, that is, of what the assumption that it can be solved shows about the nature of belief and desire. I will be particularly concerned to show that Erkenntnis 13 (1978) 9-61. All Rights Reserved Copyright ? 1978 by D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, Holland</page><page sequence="2">10 HARTRY H. FIELD one cannot solve Brentano's problem merely by adopting the kind of functionalist theory of belief and desire that Robert Stalnaker and David Lewis have advocated.3 In the second half of the paper I shall elaborate on the position suggested in the first half, and discuss some implications of my conclusions about intentionality for the philosophy of language. I should say at the outset that my presupposition that people do in fact believe and desire is intended to be a presupposition that an instrumental istic view of belief-talk and desire-talk is inappropriate. I am presupposing in other words, that belief and desire ascriptions can be literally true, rather than being merely useful devices that we adopt for various purposes but for which talk of truth and falsity is inappropriate. It is clear that belief in materialism even together with the view that belief-talk and desire-talk are highly useful instruments is not sufficient to entail that Brentano's problem is solvable;4 so the adoption of an instrumentalistic view of belief-talk and desire-talk is a possible way to save materialism and yet avoid having to solve Brentano's problem. To my mind, however, instru? mentalism is unappealing: it seems to me that if a psychological theory that postulates beliefs and desires works well, and there is no available theory that works better, then barring strong specific reasons to the contrary, we should regard that theory as literally true. That it should be so regarded is a working hypothesis under which I am operating in this paper. I. THE BASIC ARGUMENT One way to reply to Brentano's argument would be to develop a theory of belief, desire, etc. according to which the objects of belief and desire were not propositions, but something more 'accessible', say sentences. If we construed belief and desire as relations between people and sentences, then - at least if we also demanded that the sentences a believer or d?sirer were related to were sentences in a language he was familiar with - it would presumably be possible to give an account of these relations in a materialistically impeccable way. I will have more to say about this method of dealing with Brentano's problem later on. For now I want to ignore it. Suppose then that we accept the idea that belief and desire are relations between people and propositions; and suppose, for definiteness, that we follow Lewis and Stalnaker in taking propositions to be sets of possible worlds. The question arises, how can one give a materialistically acceptable account of a relation between a person and a proposition so construed ?</page><page sequence="3">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 11 The question is neither silly nor impossible to answer. One might think it were silly: "If you accept the ontology of propositions, plus a minimal amount of set theory, then a relation between people and propositions is merely a set of ordered pairs whose first members are people and whose second members are propositions. Or better - since the same person can be in the belief relation at one time but not at another - the belief relation is merely a function that assigns to each time a set of ordered pairs of people and propositions. A function assigning sets of ordered pairs is not a mental entity at all, let alone an irreducibly mental one, so what's the problem" ? Needless to say, this misses the point. If this way of dismissing Brentano's question were legitimate, we could equally well dismiss any other prima facie difficulty for materialism without doing any substantive work, so that materialism would be a totally vacuous doctrine. For instance, if someone asked how to give a materialist account of pain, one could say, "What's the problem? Pain is simply a set of people, viz. those people that we say 'feel pain' or 'are in pain'. Or better - since the same person can feel pain at one time but not at others - pain is a function that assigns to each time the set of people who are in pain at that time. Such a function is a purely set-theoretic entity; it is not mental, let alone irreducibly mental, hence it carries no problem for materialism". I take it to be obvious that this set-theoretic approach to the theory of pain is totally unsatisfying. And I can't think of any reason why the set-theoretic approach to the theory of belief and desire should be thought to be any better. Part of the explanation of why the set-theoretic account of pain is unsatisfying is that it treats pain as a set rather than a property. What is needed is an account of that property of people that 'pain' stands for which is materialistically acceptable - we need to show that property is not irreducibly mental. What the set-theoretic account does is to ignore the question of the property altogether, and to focus instead on the set of things that have that property. (Or - since the same thing can have the property at one time but not another - it focusses on the function-in extension mapping each time into the set of things that have the property at the time.) Obviously there is no substantive question of this set (or this function) being irreducibly mental; but that just shows that the interesting question concerns not the set but the property. This diagnosis extends to the case of belief: the interesting question about belief is a question about the relation that 'belief stands for, where by 'relation'</page><page sequence="4">12 HARTRY H. FIELD I mean not 'set of ordered pairs but '2-place property'. What a materialist needs to show is that that property is not irreducibly mental. But is there any hope of giving a materialistically acceptable account of the belief relation? In particular, is there any hope of doing this when we take belief to be a relation between people and propositions, and construe propositions in terms of possible worlds? It might be thought that the answer is 'obviously no', and that this fact shows the untenability of treating belief as a relation between a person and a set of possible worlds. I believe however that such a dismissal of the possible-worlds view of belief would be too quick: for I believe that it is possible to give a materialistically adequate account of the belief relation, even if that rela? tion is construed as a relation to sets of possible worlds. I will now sketch a possible such account. We will see later that the main elements of this account can be preserved even if we abandon the assumption that belief is a relation between people and sets of possible worlds. The account involves the assumption that the belief relation is a com? posite of two other relations: first, a relation between a person and a sentence that the person understands; second, a relation between the sentence and a set of possible worlds. This will be refined shortly, but unrefined, the claim is this : (1) X believes that p if and only if there is a sentence S such that X believes* S and S means that p. Here believes* is a relation between a person and a sentence in his own language: I believe* the English sentence 'Snow is white' but not the sentence 'Snow is green', and no one ignorant of English believes* either of these sentences.5 The effect of adopting (1) is to divide the problem of giving a materialistically adequate account of the belief relation into two subproblems: subproblem (a): the problem of explaining what it is for a person to believe* a sentence (of his or her own language). subproblem (b): the problem of explaining what it is for a sentence to mean that p. (The problem of giving a materialistically adequate account of the</page><page sequence="5">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 13 desire relation would be split into two subproblems in the analogous way, by introducing a notion of desiring*.) The rough idea of how to give an account of (a) should be clear enough: I believe* a sentence of my language if and only if I am disposed to employ that sentence in a certain way in reasoning, deliberating, and so on. This is very vague of course, but providing that the vagueness can be eliminated and providing that a physical basis can be found for the dispositions in? voked, then believing* will not be a relation that poses any problems for the materialist, iater on in this section I will state a more precise version of a dispositional account of believing*, one which will make it pretty clear what a physical basis for the disposition invoked would have to be like. But I hope that even the vague remarks above are enough to predispose the reader to think that believing* is not a relation that should be a particular worry to a materialist (even a materialist impressed by Brentano's problem). On the other hand, anyone impressed with Brentano's problem is likely to be impressed with subproblem (b), for unlike (a), (b) invokes a semantic relation (of meaning that). Before looking into the question of whether it is reasonable to expect that a materialistically acceptable account of (b) could be given, let me note two auxiliary advantages of adhering to (1), and then go on to con? sider a necessary refinement in what I have said. The first auxiliary advan? tage of approaching the problem of explaining what it is to believe that p via (1) is that with this approach we need not assume from the outset the controversial assumption that the objects of belief are propositions. That is, if we later come up with a way to explain what it is to mean that/? which does not make meaning that a relation between sentences and propositions, then if we also adopted (1) we would have an account of believing that according to which it was not a relation between people and propositions either. In fact, one can adhere to (1) without assuming that the occurrences of '/?' in it are occurrences of a quantifiable variable; they can be taken to be just instances of a schematic letter, so that talk of the objects of belief (as such talk has heretofore been construed) makes no literal sense. Such a possibility will be discussed in Section III; for now however I will con? tinue to adopt Lewis' and Stalnaker's assumption that '/?' is a quantifiable variable and stands for entities that are to be explained in terms of possible worlds. A second auxiliary advantage of (1), for possible world theorists, is that</page><page sequence="6">14 HARTRY H. FIELD it would give them a plausible way to make distinctions of belief which are intuitively there but which cannot be made on the possible worlds account as it stands. Consider any set theorist (who believes the axiom of choice) who has never heard of the Banach-Tarski theorem; if someone now formulates the theorem for him (without telling him that it is a theorem), he will almost surely not believe it to be true. (In fact, he is almost sure to believe it false6; to believe it true in the circumstances described would be a more likely sign of irrationality than to believe it false.) There is a big difference, then, between believing set theory and believing set theory plus the Banach-Tarski theorem; yet set theory and set-theory-plus-Banach Tarski are logically equivalent, hence must be represented by the same set of possible worlds. Now, David Lewis has pointed out that a possible worlds theorist need not say that the conjunction of the axioms of set theory7 means the same as the conjunction of those axioms plus the Banach Tarski theorem: he can recognize finer grades of meaning than sets of possible worlds.8 A set of possible worlds can be called a coarse-grained proposition; a, fine-grained proposition is a certain complicated kind of function defined out of possible worlds, but which has coded into it, so to speak, the structure of a specific sentence. What a sentence means, on Lewis' account, is fine-grained ; but what a person believes is coarse-grained, so believing set theory and believing set-theory-plus-Banach-Tarski are precisely the same thing. Now formally speaking, it would be possible to simply take these fine? grained propositions and use them in a way that Lewis does not, as the objects of belief. But it is quite implausible to do so unless we think of beliefs as being represented in the head by sentences or something like sentences, for fine-grained propositions have the structure of specific sen? tences coded right into them. Consequently, Lewis and Stalnaker accept the idea that to believe set theory and to believe set-theory-plus-Banach Tarski are the same things. Stalnaker has tried to explain away our strong feelings to the contrary as follows : There are only two mathematically true propositions, the necessarily true one and the necessarily false one, and we all know that the first is true and the second false. But the functions that determine which of the two propositions is expressed by a given mathematical statement are just the kind that are sufficiently complex to give rise to reasonable doubt about which proposition is expressed by a statement. Hence it seems reasonable to take the objects of belief and doubt in mathematics to be proposi? tions about the relations between statements and what they say ([25], p. 88; italics mine).</page><page sequence="7">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 15 But this will not do. Let 'the Banach-Tarski conditional' stand for the conditional whose antecedent is the conjunction of the axioms of set theory (including choice) and whose consequent is the Banach-Tarski Theorem. Consider a person who doubts or disbelieves the Banach-Tarski result, but who knows the semantic rules that relate sentences in the language of set theory to propositions. According to Stalnaker, such a person doesn't really doubt or disbelieve the proposition expressed by the Banach-Tarski conditional, since that is a logical truth; what he does doubt or disbelieve is the proposition expressed by (i) the semantic rules for the language of set theory relate the Banach-Tarski conditional to the necessary truth. But since the person knows what the semantic rules for the language of set theory are, the only way he can doubt or disbelieve the proposition ex? pressed by (i) would be to doubt or disbelieve the proposition expressed by (ii) the semantic rules-relate the Banach-Tarski conditional to the necessary truth, where in the blank goes a statement of the semantic rules for the language of set theory. Unfortunately for Stalnaker, however, the proposition ex? pressed by (ii) is itself a necessary truth, and hence on Stalnaker's coarse? grained possible worlds view there is no way that anyone could doubt or disbelieve it. The ascent from mathematical propositions to metalinguistic propositions has gained nothing. I take it, then, that it is clearly desirable to be able to divide propositions more finely than sets of possible worlds : and Lewis' analysis shows us how to do this, if we can accept the idea that believing a proposition involves an attitude toward sentences. To believe set theory is very roughly to believe* the conjunction of the axioms; to believe set-theory-plus-Banach Tarski is very roughly to believe* the conjunction of those axioms plus the Banach-Tarski theorem. The sentences believed* have different fine? grained meanings, on Lewis's analysis; hence (1) assigns different fine? grained propositions to the two believers. It might be thought however that this sentential approach induces too fine-grained a distinction among beliefs; it makes the belief that either Russell was hairless or snow is white differ from the belief that if Russell was not hairless then snow is white; how then can we confidently pass from the claim that someone has the first belief to the claim that he has</page><page sequence="8">16 HARTRY H. FIELD the second? These are two possible lines of answer. The first, which I believe to be rather ad hoc and artificial, is to introduce a slight coarsen? ing of the fine-grained propositions, by taking equivalence classes under a suitable equivalence relation. The second and more satisfactory is to grant that the beliefs are indeed distinct, but to explain why someone who has one belief will nearly always have the other. Such an explanation is easy enough to give: it involves the idea that belief* is dispositional. I will now elaborate on the dispositional nature of belief* (thus returning to subproblem (1)); in the course of doing so, it will become clear why someone who has one of the two beliefs about Russell will nearly always have the other. The crudest approach to the problem of giving a materialistic account of belief * would be wholly non-dispositional : this approach would involve the assumption that a person could believe* a sentence only if the sentence were explicitly stored in the person's head. (Similarly for desire*. If we adhere to this non-dispositional approach we must suppose that there are at least two kinds of storage, storage-as-belief and storage-as-desire. The precise details of how sentences are stored-as-beliefs or stored-as desires is of course not a matter that can be settled without detailed neurophysiological investigation.) A defect of this approach is that people apparently believe infinitely many propositions; if so, then if we adopt (1) (and assume that the relation of meaning that is not one-many), it follows that people believe* infinitely many sentences. But there is no way that infinitely many sentences can be explicitly stored in a finite head, so the idea that a sentence must be explicitly stored to be believed* is false. This argument suggests that some kind of dispositional approach to belief* is required. (This conclusion can in fact be argued for without the assumption that we have infinitely many beliefs.) The simplest kind of dispositional account (suggested by Dennett9) is that an organism has stored within it certain explicitly represented beliefs, which Dennett calls core beliefs', and what we say a person believes are just the obvious con? sequences of his core beliefs. [Not: the obvious consequences of his beliefs', for then we could show recursively that even very unobvious consequences of beliefs had also to be beliefs (since unobvious inferences can be broken down into a large number of obvious ones).] If the core belief approach is correct, then it may be the notion of core belief rather than the notion of belief that would enter into any detailed psychological</page><page sequence="9">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 17 theory. But even if this is so, it is the notion of belief rather than the notion of core belief which is more useful to us in everyday life, for it is much easier to know what a person believes than what he core-believes. The reason is clear: when the proposition A is an obvious enough con? sequence of one's core beliefs, one is almost sure to add A to one's belief core whenever any question as to the truth of A arises; behaviorally, then, it will be hard to distinguish this case from the case where A was present in one's belief core all along. But there are many cases where it is perfectly clear that a belief is not part of one's belief core. For instance, suppose I tell you that no one dug a tunnel from here to China through the center of the earth in 1953. I'm sure that by telling you this I'm not telling you something you didn't already believe, but I'm equally sure that it was not part of your belief core - i.e., not one of your explicitly represented beliefs - before I told it to you. This idea of core belief gives us a very natural proposal for solving sub problem (a). The idea is simply to say that one believes* a sentence if and only if that sentence is an obvious consequence of sentences that are explicitly stored (in that manner of storage appropriate to beliefs as opposed to say desires).10 This kind of account would make clear why someone who believes that either Russell was hairless or snow is white would almost certainly also believe that if Russell was not hairless then snow is white: almost any stock of core beliefs from which the former was an obvious consequence would also be a stock of core beliefs from which the latter was an obvious consequence.11 (This solves the problem from which we began.) The account also makes clear why there is a certain vagueness or indeterminacy in ascriptions of belief that are far removed from the core (e.g., of why, when a philosopher's beliefs show a deep in? consistency, there is no clear point to asking whether he believes or dis? believes a proposition about which he has expressed no opinion but which is both provable and refutable by equally unobvious reasoning from things that he has committed himself to). The indeterminacy comes in because of the use of the notion of obviousness in defining belief from core belief.12 It is a striking advantage of the core-belief proposal that it explains these facts. I think then that the core-belief approach to subproblem (a) is quite attractive. However, I do not want to insist on it: conceivably it is pos? sible to develop a more subtle kind of dispositional approach to belief* -</page><page sequence="10">18 HARTRY H. FIELD perhaps an approach which would require fewer sentences to be explicitly stored. (It seems quite unlikely, however, that one could do without stored sentences altogether.) I take no stand on whether an alternative to the core belief approach would be preferable, for I think I have said enough to make it plausible that in some way or other subproblem (a) could be solved. Before turning to subproblem (b) - the problem of giving a material? istically adequate account of the relation of meaning that (which we are temporarily assuming to relate sentences to sets of possible worlds) - I should mention the long-promised refinement that is needed in (1). The need of the refinement arises from the fact that dogs, chimpanzees, and young children presumably have beliefs but have no language. One could of course simply insist that beliefs and desires are not to be attributed to these or any other languageless creatures. To do so however does not seem very plausible. After all, we do often explain the behavior of languageless creatures by postulating beliefs and desires; and while in some such cases the explanations are clearly anthropomorphic and the behavior can be explained in simpler ways, there are many cases involving psychologically complicated organisms where these are the only sorts of explanation avail? able. It seems rather rash to conclude that all such explanations are false, and therefore we must modify (1). Fortunately only a minor modification is needed, if we accept the widely held view13 that though a dog has no language, he does have some kind of system of internal representation, and that it is only because he has some system of internal representation that he can represent to himself, and believe, any proposition. Let us then modify (1) by abandoning the requirement that the entities which are believed* be literally sentences, let us require instead only that they be either sentences or sentence-analogs - where by a sentence analog I simply mean some psychological entity which represents propositions (or more neutrally, which has the kind of meaning or content which sentences have). (1) should be replaced, then, by (1') X believes that p if and only if there is a sentence or sentence analog S such that X believes* S and S means that p. This shift has an independent virtue in connection with adult humans that do have a language: it allows for the possibility that they might have beliefs that go somewhat beyond the expressive capacity of their languages.</page><page sequence="11">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 19 Many philosophers are hostile to postulating systems of internal repre? sentation in languageless organisms; I will try to remove some of that hostility later on in the paper. But perhaps I can undercut some of the hostility in advance by noting that on my view, the system of internal representation in which a chimpanzee believes and desires would presum? ably have a much simpler structure than human languages have - its 'sentence-analogs' would be much simpler syntactically than English sentences are, and by calling them 'sentence-analogs' I do not mean to be denying the existence of these structural disanalogies. How simple could an animal's 'system of internal representation' be and still count as a system of representation? This seems to me an uninteresting question of terminology. If you like, you could even allow that an animal's 'system of internal representation' consisted of five sentences, each of them syn? tactically unstructured. However, I don't think that there is much point in saying that an animal believes or desires things unless one attributes a reasonably complex system of beliefs and desires to it; and (according to (1')) a reasonably complex system of beliefs and desires will require a reasonably complex system of representation. So there is no point in attributing a system of internal representation at all unless one attributes a reasonably complex one. But there is no need to draw a precise line and say "something must be at least this complicated to count as a system of internal representation"; where such a line would go is merely a matter of how widely one wants to extend the term 'belief. My claim is inde? pendent of such terminological issues: it is that organisms which are sufficiently complicated for the notions of belief and desire to be clearly applicable have systems of internal representation in which the sentence analogs have significant grammatical structure. Couldn't we avoid introducing systems of internal representation, by an alternative modification of (1)? The alternative revision would be to give up the requirement that an organism believe* a sentence only if he understands it: we could then say that dogs believe* sentences of human languages like English and Serbo-Croatian. There are three problems with this approach: (A) The approach is not very useful as a step toward solving Brentano's problem: on this approach, believes* would become a semantic relation - it would be a relation between organisms</page><page sequence="12">20 HARTRY H. FIELD and sentences of English (or Serbo-Croatian) which holds in virtue of the meanings of those sentences. Consequently, the proposed alternative to (1) would divide the original belief relation between organisms and propositions into two semantic relations (since means that is also semantic) ; and since semantic relations are just the sorts of relations that Brentano thought were inexplicable, this would appear to be a doubling of our original problem. (B) The second problem with the suggestion is that the whole point of the notions of belief and desire is to aid us in explain? ing behavior. It seems rather bizarre to explain a chimpanzee's behavior via his relation to sentences in a human language that he doesn't understand; facts about English sentences have nothing whatever to do with why the chimpanzee behaves as he does. So it is important to leave English sentences out of the account of belief and desire for chimpanzees. The third problem with the suggestion is mentioned in Section III. Be? cause of these difficulties, I think that (1') is the only reasonable modifica? tion of (1). Let us turn, finally, to subproblem (b), which because of the shift from (1) to (1') is the problem of giving a materialistically acceptable account of what it is for a sentence or a sentence-analog in a system of internal representation to mean that p. Recall that we are temporarily construing means that as relating sentences (and sentence-analogs) to sets of possible worlds (or to slightly more structured entities built up out of functions defined on possible worlds; but for simplicity let us ignore this more complicated account - it raises no new difficulties of principle for a materialist theory of belief.) What set of possible worlds does a sentence (or sentence analog) mean? It means the set of possible worlds at which the sentence is true. If then we can give a materialistically acceptable account of the relation between sentences and worlds of being true at, then we will have a materialistically acceptable account of (b). Now, in another paper14 I have argued that it is possible to give a materialistically adequate account of truth (i.e., of truth at the actual world). The idea of how this is done is simplest for the very simple lan? guages that logicians usually discuss; there it involves giving a Tarski</page><page sequence="13">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 21 type truth-definition. Such a truth-definition explains what it is for a sentence to be true (at the actual world) in terms of what it is for a name to denote an object (at the actual world), what it is for a predicate to have a certain extension (at the actual world), and so forth. In other words, such a truth-definition reduces the problem of what it is for a sentence to be true (at the actual world) to what it is for the one-word components of the sentence to stand (at the actual world) for certain entities or sets of entities. I argued that we have every reason to think that the relations of standing for (i.e., the relations of denoting, having as an extension, etc.) are explainable in a materialistically acceptable way, and so the truth definition gives us derivatively a materialistically acceptable account of truth (at the actual world). The above remarks are for sentences of the simple languages to which Tarski's methods apply directly; but following Davidson1&amp; and many other philosophers, I believe that such methods are generalizable to natural languages, so that for sentences in natural languages too we can say that truth can be explained in a materialistically acceptable way. And the same should be true for sentence-analogs, if we suppose that they are sufficiently like the sentences in natural languages. I have claimed that we can give a materialistically adequate account of truth, i.e., truth at the actual world. But what we need, if we are to explain what it is to mean a Stalnaker-type proposition, is a materialistically adequate account of truth at w for an arbitrary possible world w. And this, it may seem, is much harder to come by: for if we relativize Tarskian semantics to an arbitrary possible world w, we find that it explains what it is for a sentence to be true at w in terms of what it is for a name to refer to an entity at w and what it is for a predicate to have a set of entities as its extension at w. That is, we need to invoke relations of words (in the actual world) standing for entities or sets of entities in the possible world w; and it is difficult to see how to explain such trans-world relations in a materialistically acceptable way. This however is a very misleading way of looking at the matter: for in actual fact one can define truth at w purely in terms of relations between words (in the actual world) and entities in the actual world. For instance, for a sentence of form ^(b)1 where P is a predicate and b a, name, the definition will read rPCi)1 is true at w if and only if there is an object x that b</page><page sequence="14">22 HARTRY H. FIELD denotes (in the actual world) and a property Z that P stands for (in the actual world), and w is a world in which x exists and has Z. For example, 'Bertrand Russell is hairless' is true at any possible world w in which Bertrand Russell (i.e., the person denoted in the actual world by the name 'Bertrand Russell') exists and is hairless (i.e., has the property that the word 'hairless' stands for in the actual world). So truth at w is definable in terms of the relation of denotation for names together with the relation of standing for predicates, where it is now to be understood that a predicate stands not for a set (its extension) but for a property that exists in the actual world.16 So the problem of giving a materialistically adequate account of truth at w reduces to (i) the problem of giving a materialistically adequate account of actual-world-denotation for names, and (ii) the problem of giving a materialistically adequate account of actual-world-standing-for for predicates, where as I've said predicates are now to be construed as standing for properties rather than sets. But (i) is a problem that arose even in the account of truth in the actual world ; I'm assuming (since I've argued it in the aforementioned article) that we have good reason to believe that that problem is solvable. With (ii) the situation is a bit dif? ferent. What we need in any account of truth-in-the-actual-world is a materialistically adequate account of the relation between predicates and their actual world extensions; let us then assume that that problem is solvable. But (ii) requires something that is formally stronger; it requires a materialistically adequate account of the relation between predicates and properties; and since these properties determine but are not deter? mined by the extensions of the predicates, what we need is formally stronger than what actual-world semantics would have to give us. A little reflection will show however that actual-world semantics is bound to give the formally stronger thing as well. For what could a materialistically adequate account of the relation 'is the extension of be like? Such an account would have to tell us the kinds of facts about the way we use words in virtue of which the set of hairless things is the extension of the word 'hairless'. How could it do that? One possibility is that it would be a causal theory of reference: it would state that some kind of causal connection between hairless individuals and our use of the word 'hairless'</page><page sequence="15">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 23 is responsible for our word having the set of hairless individuals as its extension. But surely we have not come into causal contact with all members of the extension of 'hairless' - after all, there are hairless things on remote planets, there are hairless things that exist only in the distant future, and so forth. How could causal contact with certain hairless individuals help in solving the problem of what makes our word 'hairless' have as its extension a set which includes such future hairless creatures (and which excludes the future hairy ones) ? The only possible answer, I think, is that the extension of the term 'hairless' is determined by a property. What is directly associated with the predicate is not its extension, but a certain property. Perhaps the property of hairlessness is associated with the term 'hairless' by causal connection with a number of hairless individuals, as a causal theory of reference would have it; or perhaps there is some non-causal theory of reference which determines how the property of hairlessness is associated with the word. But however that association is made, the association of an extension with the word 'hairless' is a derivative one: the extension of 'hairless' is simply the set of objects (in the actual world) which have that property which in the actual world is associated with the word 'hairless'. If it were impossible to give a material? istically adequate account of how properties were associated with predi? cates, then it would be impossible to give a materialistically adequate account of how sets are associated with predicates, and so it would be impossible to give a materialistically adequate account of actual-world truth. So the problem of giving a materialistically adequate account of truth-at-a-possible-world is no more difficult than the task of giving a materialistically adequate account of truth-in-the-actual-world; funda? mentally, these apparently distinct problems are one and the same. I now have all the pieces : let me put them in place. The task with which I have been occupied for most of Section I has been to explain ont possible approach to giving a materialistically adequate account of belief; and I have been assuming for the time being that belief is to be construed as a relation between people and sets of possible worlds. The 'other? worldly' character of the assumed objects of belief might appear to rule out the possibility of a materialistic account of the belief relation, but, I have argued, that appearance is illusory. For we can say that a person believes a set/? of possible worlds if and only if he believes* some sentence (or sentence-analog) S, and p is the set of possible worlds at which S is</page><page sequence="16">24 HARTRY H. FIELD true. And (given the ontology of possible worlds) defining truth at a possible world requires no more resources than are required for defining genuine truth, i.e., truth at the actual world: both of these tasks require us to explain what makes the names in S denote whatever items in the actual world they do denote, and what makes the predicates in S stand for whatever properties in the actual world they do stand for,17 and that is doubtless a difficult task; but I know of no reason to believe that the task is hopeless, and in fact (as I've argued in the aforementioned article) I think there is good reason to think it can be solved. The account of believing that has just been elaborated has only been put forward as a possible account. It is in fact an account that I will want to revise in certain respects later on - e.g., by dropping all reference to propositions and possible worlds. But I will not revise the two central features of the account given so far: the idea that belief involves a relation to sentences or to something very much like sentences, and the idea that these sentences must be given a Tarski-like semantics (including a theory of reference for the primitives). To a large extent, my adherence to these two ideas is based on an inability to conceive of what a solution to Brentano's problem that did not rely on these ideas would be like. I do not claim to have proved that there could be no alternative account of belief that solved Brentano's problem but did not have the two features mentioned above. However, I have never seen even a clear sketch of what such an alternative account would be like. The fact that, the kind of ac? count that I have sketched above would solve Brentano's problem, and that no alternative solutions to the problem are known, seems to me to provide a very strong reason for tentatively accepting the kind of account sketched.18 At this point the reader may feel that there is a well-known alternative account of belief that will either solve Brentano's problem, or show it to be a pseudo-problem. That alternative account (according to my hypo? thetical reader) is the account that Lewis and Stalnaker actually advocate: it is the functionalist alternative. In the next section I will examine the question of whether functionalism does indeed solve or dissolve Brentano's problem. II. FUNCTIONALISM The Lewis-Stalnaker approach to belief involves the idea that believing is a functional state. Putting the view very roughly, a state of an organism</page><page sequence="17">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 25 is a state of believing that p if that state plays an appropriate role in the organisms's psychology: that is, if it is causally connected to inputs and outputs and to other psychological states in the right sort of way. Now it certainly seems at first as if such a functional theory of belief allows for the possibility of beliefs independent of language or of inner representa? tions: that is, why couldn't it be the case that an organism is in a state which is causally connected to inputs and outputs and to other states in the right sort of way for that state to satisfy the functional conditions for being a belief that p, even though that state does not involve a relation to any sentence or to any sentence-like item in any system of inner repre? sentation? Stalnaker has put the point as follows: It is conceivable (whether or not it is true) that there are rational creatures who have beliefs and desires, but who do not use language, and who have no internal repre? sentations of their attitudes which have a linguistic form. I think this is true of many animals - even some rather stupid ones - but there might be clearer cases. Imagine that we discovered living creatures - perhaps on some other planet - who did not communicate, but whose behavior was predictable, for the most part, on the hypoth? esis that they engaged in highly sophisticated theoretical deliberation. Imagine further that we had this indirect evidence supporting our hypotheses: that the beliefs that our hypothesis attributed to these creatures could be causally explained, in many cases, in terms of their sensory inputs; and that the desires attributed to them by the hypothesis were correlated appropriately, for the most part, with the physical re? quirements for their survival. Finally, imagine that we test the hypothesis by manipu? lating the environments of these creatures, say by feeding them misleading 'evidence' and by satisfying or frustrating some of their alleged desires. If they continued to behave as predicted, I think we would be tempted to attribute to these creatures not just belief and desire analogues, but beliefs and desires themselves. We would not, however, have any reason to hypothesize that they thought in a mental language, or in any language at all ([25], p. 82). Is Stalnaker right about this ? In order to evaluate Stalnaker's claims, we need to make the idea of a functional theory of belief much clearer than my crude description above makes it. According to the crude description above, a state of an organ? ism is a state of believing that p if the state is causally connected to inputs and outputs and to other psychological states in the right sort of way; but until we know what the other psychological states are that it must be causally connected to, and what is 'the right sort of way' for it to be connected to them, we are in no position to determine whether such a functional theory of belief requires a system of inner representation. (E.g., why couldn't one of the other states to which a state of belief that</page><page sequence="18">26 HARTRY H. FIELD p must be causally connected be a state of having an inner representation of the proposition /??) This fact must be borne in mind in considering Stalnaker's story about the creatures on another planet. It is perfectly clear that in the situation Stalnaker describes, we could not be absolutely certain that the creatures thought in any internal system of representation. But it is also perfectly clear that we could not be absolutely certain that they had beliefs and desires. We couldn't be certain of this because (a) we have not observed all of their actual behavior, let alone all of their possible behavior, and (b) because even if we had, a claim about beliefs and desires is not simply a claim about behavior, it is a claim about how that behavior is produced. Of course, we do not need to have detailed knowledge of how that behavior is produced to know whether the organ? ism has beliefs and desires - the whole point of functionalism is to provide a fairly abstract representation of an organism's inner states, so that certain kinds of information about the organism's inner states will be irrelevant to the question of whether it has beliefs and desires. But we do need some knowledge about how that behavior is produced in order to know that it has beliefs and desires: a functionalist's claim about an organism's inner states is a claim about that organism's inner states, and is not reducible to any claims about the organism's actual and possible behavior. (That fact is, I hope, common knowledge. It comes out very clearly in Lewis' precise explication of the functionalist claim, which I will give shortly.) Consequently, when we conclude of the creatures on the other planet that they have beliefs and desires, we do so because that is the best explanation we can find of their behavior. But now, if we can know that the creatures have beliefs and desires because belief-and desire theory is the best available explanation of their behavior, why couldn't we also know that the creatures have a system of inner repre? sentation, by the same means? Whether the first inference has better inductive warrant than the second is not something that can be settled by a casual appeal to intuitions : it depends on whether it is possible to come up with an adequate functional account of belief and desire accord? ing to which belief and desire do not require internal representation. So the last sentence of the quotation from Stalnaker (or, if you like, the conjunction of the last two sentences) simply begs the question at issue. Perhaps its conclusion is correct, but we can show this only by a detailed examination of what a functional theory of belief would be like.</page><page sequence="19">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 27 A full discussion of this topic would be two-fold. Part of such a discus? sion would involve the question of whether any adequate theory of belief would have to have assumptions about internal representation explicitly built into it. I am strongly inclined to think it would, and I think my remarks about core beliefs in Section I and the remarks about propositions in Section III provide some support for this claim; but the ultimate proof of the claims lies in the detailed development of psycho? logical theory. In this section I will not deal with these matters, but will undertake a more modest task: I want to show that the functionalist approach to theories of believing and desiring does not provide an alternative to the idea that belief requires some system of representation. In saying this I mean to be saying much more than that functionalism is compatible with there being some system of inner representation (in? volving sentences of natural language and/or sentence-analogs): that point is certainly not one that either Lewis or Stalnaker would deny. Both of them would certainly agree that if we opened up a person's head and found a blackboard inside on which various English sentences were written, and if we also found that the occurrence of those sentences on that blackboard entered in the right way into that person's behavior, then that would be strong reason to suppose that (for that person anyway) belief involved inner representation. This would of course not conflict with functionalism, for what we would be discovering is simply that the state which (in that person) is causally connected in the right sort of ways to inputs and outputs and to other states happens to be a state which involves inner representations. It is uncontroversial, then, that functional? ism is compatible with the inner representation hypothesis. But I want to argue for a much stronger claim, one which I suspect Lewis and Stalnaker would deny (though I infer this more from the general tone of their dis? cussions than from anything they explicitly say). What I suspect Lewis and Stalnaker hold is that without opening up people's heads, we can have little or no reason to think that believing anything involves a system of inner representation; the hypothesis that belief does involve a system of inner representation, then, is simply unfounded neurophysiological speculation. Now, in Section 11 have given a, prima facie argument that it was not just unfounded neurophysiological speculation: the inner rep? resentation hypothesis, I claimed, was the only known possibility for solving Brentano's problem, and this in itself provides good reason for</page><page sequence="20">28 HARTRY H. FIELD tentatively accepting it. But in arguing that, I ignored the possibility of the functionalist approach. What we must investigate now, then, is whether the functionalist approach alters the conclusion. My claim is that it does not, and that is what I mean when I say that functionalism provides no alternative to the view that belief requires some system of representation. To put my claim in a sentence, then, it is that functionalism does not provide a solution to Brentano's problem, nor does it in any way dissolve the problem. That is the claim to be argued in this section. The whole point of functionalism in psychology is to provide a fairly abstract representation of psychological properties, a representation that is not tied too closely to the details of the physical structure of particular organisms; in fact, a functional theory guarantees that if two organisms are, in a suitable sense, psychologically isomorphic, then they have pre? cisely the same psychological properties, however different they may be in those aspects of physical structure that are not relevant to establishing the psychological isomorphism. A functionalist does not say that the physical structure of an organism is irrelevant to its psychological proper? ties : nearly all functionalists are materialists, that is, they believe that all psychological properties require a physical realization.12 This means for instance that for any organism X and any time t, X can have a 1-place psychological property 0 at t only if X has at / some physical property R(i/j) which realizes *p (in a sense soon to be made precise). But different physical properties can realize the same psychological properties in different organisms (or in the same organisms at different times); so organisms of very different structure can have the same psychological properties. It is because the functionalist allows the possibility of different realizations - not because he gives up the requirement of a realization altogether - that he achieves the goal of abstracting from the physical structure of particular organisms.20 It will be important in what follows to have a clear idea of what a realization of a psychological property is, and of what a psychological property itself is. The following account is David Lewis's,21 except for a few minor divergences (mentioned in footnotes) which make no difference to the argument at hand. Suppose that &lt;f&gt; is a psychological theory that is intended to apply at any time t to all organisms which are of type 2 at t. (&lt;? might for instance</page><page sequence="21">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 29 be a theory intended to apply to all adult humans, or to all organisms capable of feeling pain, or to all rational beings.)218. For simplicity, let us suppose that &lt;f&gt; is finitely axiomatized; then we can represent it as a single formula which I abbreviate as A{%, t), where x is a variable ranging over organisms and t a variable ranging over times. [Then the theory is true of all the organisms in its intended range if and only if the following claim holds: For any t and any x&gt; if x is of type S at t then A(%, t). It is this last claim, rather than &lt;j&gt;, that is properly speaking true or false, so you might prefer to use the term 'theory' for the last claim rather than for &lt;/&gt;.] In giving crude formulations of psychological theories we often omit the variables (and initial quantifiers), but they must be understood as implicit: we say 'pain has such and such a causal role' when what we really mean is 'For any t and any x of type 2 at t, pain has such and such a causal role in x at t'. If we do not write the theory in this way, we cannot properly define the notion of a realization.22 Suppose that the specifically psychological23 primitives in &lt;/&gt; are Tl9..., Tn; then we can write &lt;f&gt; as A(Tl9..., Tn; x, t). For simplicity, I will assume that Tx,...,Tn are all predicates.24 Let us say that an ?-tuple &lt;Pl5..., Pn&gt; of properties realizes &lt;f&gt; in organism X at time t if and only if the formula A(Yl9..., Yn; x, t) is true of &lt;Pl5.. .,Pn, X,t}; and that such an ?-tuple uniquely realizes &lt;f&gt; in X at tif it and no other ?-tuple realizes &lt;/&gt; in X at t. Now if &lt;/&gt; is a psychological theory with n primitive psychological predicates we can use it to define n functional properties. Suppose for in? stance that Tj is a predicate that stands for a 1-place property of organisms, the kind of property (like pain) of which it makes sense to say that the organism has it at one time but not at another. (Lewis calls properties of this sort 'states',25 but I prefer to reserve this term for a different use.) If Tj is a predicate of this sort, then the jth functional property associated with &lt;f&gt; is the property ^ defined as follows: (2) X has 0 at t =df there is some 1-place physical26 property P such that (i) P is the jth component of a unique27 realization of &lt;/&gt; in X at t</page><page sequence="22">30 HARTRY H. FIELD (ii) X has P at t If iff is the yth functional property associated with &lt;f&gt;, we can then say that a realization ofif? in X at t is simply they'th component of a unique realiza? tion of &lt;f&gt; in X at t. From this and (2) we derive (2') X has 0 at f if and only if there is some 1-place physical property P such that (i) P realizes 0 in X at t, and (ii) X has P at t. This machinery enables us to give a precise sense to the general remarks of five paragraphs back. What functionalism about pain claims is that the property of pain28 is a functional property associated with some theory &lt;f)p by (2) (or by the analog of (2) with the word 'physical' replaced by 'non-functional' - see note 26). By taking functionalism in this way we can make precise sense of various vague notions appealed to in the general remarks (e.g., the notion of psychological isomorphism), and we can also verify the really important claim that if materialism is true, then for an organism to have the psychological property of pain it must have some physical property that realizes that psychological property in the organism. Now let us apply this machinery to the case of believing, where we assume as before that belief is a relation between an organism and a proposition. Belief, then, will be a functional relation associated with some theory &lt;f&gt;b in which the term 'believes' occurs, say as the yth psycho? logical term. We cannot of course apply the schema (2) to define such a functional property, since (2) made sense only in defining properties that correspond to 1-place predicates, but it is clear enough how to generalize it to entities of another kind: (3) Xbears iff top at t = df there is some 2-place physical property R such that (i) R is the yth component of a unique realization of &lt;/&gt; in X ait (ii) X bears R to p at t No other generalization of (2) to the case of 2-place functional properties is possible. Now the important thing to note about this is that it existentially</page><page sequence="23">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 31 quantifies over physical relations between people and propositions. If there is no physical relation of an appropriate sort between a person and a proposition, then according to (3) the person cannot stand in the functional relation ^ to the proposition. The functional relation ^ is not itself a physical relation; but if i/j is to relate an organism to a proposi? tion at a time, there must be some physical relation Rty) which realizes t/j and which related the organism to the proposition. Thus even if we take belief to be a functional relation, we have to solve Brentano's problem: we have to show that there could be physical (non-functional) relations between people and propositions. That is what I meant when I said earlier that functionalism does not either solve or dissolve Brentano's problem. The only thing it says of relevance to that problem is something that probably no one ever doubted anyway: that the physical relation that relates me now to the propositions I believe can differ from the one that relates dogs to the propositions they believe; and even from the one that relates other people to the propositions they believe, and from the one that related me twenty years ago to the propositions I believed then. In other words: it is indeed legitimate to solve Brentano's problem in different ways for different organisms; but this does not remove the need for solving the prob? lem within an organism. I don't mean to downgrade the importance of the observation that we don't need to solve Brentano's problem in the same way in different organisms : that fact is crucial to the plausibility of the model of believing put forth in Section I, for no one could plausibly claim that the relation of believing* is physically the same across different species. All I am saying is that to admit the allowability and importance of such variation across organisms does not in any way diminish the force of the tentative argument for the model of believing put forth in Section I. It remains true that if no other model can be given of what a physical relation between people and propositions would be like, then we should tentatively accept the model there proposed. The argument I have just given is I think an extremely obvious one: one would expect it to be obvious to anyone who thought about func? tionalism for a moment. Yet I have found in conversation that the con? clusion of the argument is one that nearly all functionalists oppose: nearly all of them are convinced that functionalism somehow undermines the argument of Section I. One reason, I suspect, is a tendency to slip from functionalism to an extreme behaviorism according to which nothing</page><page sequence="24">32 HARTRY H. FIELD inside an organism is relevant to determining its psychological properties. Another reason is perhaps a Leibnizian tendency to regard relations as less real than 1-place properties - not out of conscious doctrine but merely because of the fact that the word 'relation', unlike the word 'property', doubles as a word for a certain kind of set. But there is a third source of error that I now want to consider. It is equally crude, but I think that there are deep and subtle confusions that lead people to implicitly make it. The third source of error is that even among people who explicitly advocate the view that belief is a relation between people and proposi? tions, there seems to be a tendency to sometimes fall into the 'orthographic accident' view: the view that an adequate theory of belief could treat 'X believes that Russell was hairless', 'X believes that either Russell was hairless or snow is white', etc., as primitive 1-place predicates, and do without the 2-place predicate 6X believes that p' entirely. (The fact that the term 'believes that' occurs in both 1-place predicates would then be, from a theoretical view, of no significance, a mere orthographic accident; that fact that both contain 'Russell was hairless' would likewise be an orthographic accident.) It is not easy to take such a view seriously. But let us suppose it were true: what would follow? Well, the account would clearly obviate the need for a physical relation between people and propositions: since it didn't talk of a psychological relation between people and propositions, it is clear that no physical relation between people and propositions would be needed in a realization. But this of course does not refute the point I was making in this section, which is that if you do construe belief relationally, you need a physical realization of the belief relation. In spite of the crudity of this mistake, I think that it is an easy one to make implicitly. In fact, in the opening paragraph of this section, when I tried to motivate the view that functionalism obviated the need of a system of representation, I found myself talking in a way that strongly suggested the orthographic accident view: I said "a state of an organism is a state of believing that p if that state plays the appropriate role in the organism's psychology". Now, for this to make any sense, the letter '/?' here must be understood as abbreviating a specific sentence - say 'Either Russell was hairless or snow is white'. Now, what is "the appropriate role" of the state of believing that either Russell was hairless or snow is white? I do not say that no sense can be made of such talk: if we give a functional</page><page sequence="25">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 33 account of the relation of believing which holds between organisms and propositions, such an account will certainly have implications about the state of believing the particular proposition that Russell was hairless or snow is white. I think however that talk of "the appropriate role" of the state of believing this particular proposition strongly suggests that we can give a direct functional definition of this particular state. And that strongly suggests that the kind of procedure used for 'pain' can be applied to 'believes that either Russell was hairless or snow is white': in other words, it suggests that believing that either Russell was hairless or snow is white can be regarded as a functional 1-place property defined by schema (2). That however is the orthographic accident view, for it presupposes that the theory &lt;f&gt; from which believing that either Russell was hairless or snow is white is to be functionally defined contains a primitive term that represents this property. The moral is that if you want to avoid the orthographic accident view, you should not regard 'X believes that p0' for specific sentences p0 as functionally definable in the way that 'X is in pain' is: you should regard them as defined non-functionally from a relational predicate 'X believes the p' which is functionally defined by (3). And that means that we must invoke physical relations between organisms and sets of possible worlds. I believe that there is a deeper source of the tendency to slip into the orthographic accident view; it has to do with functional theories that invoke psychological states, where 'state' is not used in Lewis' sense (cf. note 25) but in the sense of 'type of inner occurrence'. There is nothing wrong with such functional theories, but they must be treated with care, as I will now explain. The reader may however wish to skip the explana? tion and move directly to Section III (p. 36). Let us first consider the case of pain. Linguistic usage suggests the following view: (4) X feels pain at t if and only if there is an internal occurrence o such that (i) X feels o at t, and (ii) o is a pain. Now suppose that we give a theory &lt;f&gt;'p of the sortal property being a pain</page><page sequence="26">34 HARTRY H. FIELD which was used in clause (ii) of (4). It is easy to see that the proper way to functionally define being a pain from such a theory is this: (5) o is a pain if and only if there is some physical property P of inner occurrences such that (i) P is the jth component of a unique realization of &lt;f&gt;p in X at t, and (ii) o has the property P. (Here t is the time of occurrence of o and X is the organism in which o occurred.) Putting this together with (4), we get (6) X feels pain at t if and only if there is an internal occurrence o and a physical property P such that (i) X feels o at t (ii) o has the property P, and (iii) P is the jth component of a unique realization of &lt;f&gt;'p in X at t. Now suppose we introduce the word 'state' for physical properties of inner occurrences. (That is, let us use it for state-types; if P is a state-type then the state-tokens are the inner occurrences that have P.) If we also introduce the expression 'is in P at t ' for 'feels at t some internal occurrence of type P (i.e., with the property P)', then we can rewrite (6) as (7) X feels pain at t if and only if there is a physical state P such that (i) X is in P at t, and (ii) P is the yth component of a unique realization of &lt;/&gt;'p in X att. The problem of finding a realization of pain-theory of this kind in X at t, then, is the problem of finding a physical state of pain in Zat /; physical state in the sense of state-type, that is, in the sense of property of inner occurrences.</page><page sequence="27">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 35 Now the same thing done here for pain can be done for belief. The analogue of (4) is (4') X believes that pattif and only if there is an inner occurrence o such that (i) o occurs in X at t, and (ii) o is a belief that p Functionally defining the relation is a belief that, analogously to (5) above, and combining the result with (4'), we get (in analogy to (6) above) (6') X believes that p at tif and only if there is an internal occur? rence o and a physical relation R between internal occurrences and propositions such that (i) o occurs in X at t, (ii) o bears R to p, and (iii) R is the yth component of a unique realization of &lt;f&gt;'b in X at t. So far so good: the result makes clear that in using a psychological theory of belief of this sort, we need to find physical realizations of a relation between internal occurrences and propositions. Now suppose we want to introduce the term 'state' for a 1-place property of inner occurrences. There is no objection to doing so: for each sentencep0, there is a 1-place property of bearing R to p0, and we can call this a state (meaning of course a state-type). And we can go on to define what it is for an organism to be in such a state: X is in the state go at t if and only if there occurs in X at t some inner occurrence of the type g0 (i.e., with the property g0). But now if we try to reformulate (6') in terms of state-types, we find that we get the following: (7') X believes that p0 at t if and only if there is a physical state go such that (i) X is in go at t, and (ii) the relational component of g0 is the jth component of a unique realization of &lt;/&gt;'b in X at t (go is the property of bearing R to the specific sentence p0; by the rela? tional component of g0 I mean the relation R.) This is the correct way to introduce talk of state-types into a functional theory of belief.</page><page sequence="28">36 HARTRY H. FIELD But, I suspect, many people do not bother to think the matter through. Seeing functionalism for pain formulated as (7), they immediately jump to the conclusion that belief-theory formulated in terms of states should read as (7*) X believes that p0 at t if and only if there is a physical state go such that (i) X is in go at t, and (ii) go is the yth component of a unique realization of &lt;f&gt;b in X att. Formulated in this way, &lt;f&gt;'b has to be construed as a theory in which a term for being a state of believing p0 (for the specific sentence p0) appears as a primitive. And that of course is the orthographic accident view. The moral of all this is that the view that functionalism either solves or dissolves Brentano's problem results from confusion: the confusion of a relational theory of belief with an orthographic-accident theory of belief according to which belief is not a relation at all. I am sure that any functionalist would emphatically reject the idea that psychological theories of belief should have the orthographic-accident format; but if one thinks of states of believing as having functional roles not derivative on the functional role of the belief relation, then one is implicitly adhering to an orthographic accident account. III. DISPENSING WITH PROPOSITIONS At the beginning of Section III quoted an argument of Stalnaker's which suggested that a functional theory of belief would obviate the need for a system of internal representation. I remarked that in order to fully evaluate the argument, it was necessary to get clear on what a functional account of belief would be like. I have done that only in a very minimal sense: I have looked only at those features of a functional account of belief which follow from the nature of functionalism together with the (supposed) fact that belief involves a relation between people and propositions. But much more than this is involved in getting clear about what a functional account of belief would be like. For we have seen that on any functional account of belief, the relation of believing is a functional relation associated with a certain theory &lt;/&gt;b. Part of what's involved in getting clear on what a</page><page sequence="29">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 37 functional account of belief would be like, then, is getting clear on what &lt;f&gt;b would be like. I am strongly inclined to think that any adequate (f&gt;b would have to explicitly postulate a system of representation, and that this provides a reason to believe the internal representation hypothesis inde? pendently of any considerations about Brentano's problem. I will not how? ever try to argue this claim here. Instead I will merely note a converse: that since (as I've argued) we appear to need a system of representation in order to solve Brentano's problem, we shouldn't have too much reluctance about explicitly incorporating such a system into our psychological theory &lt;/&gt;b if doing so seems helpful. One advantage of explicitly incorporating a system of representation into one's psychological theory is that it enables us to obtain most of the advantages of regarding belief and desire as relations between people and propositions, without the attendant liabilities. Suppose that for some reason or other we do not want to quantify over propositions; in that case, then apparently we will be unable to say things like (8) There are many things she believes about him, and none of them are at all complimentary or (9) No one can perceive an object without coming to believe various things about it; for apparently the 'things' quantified over in (8) and (9) are propositions. However I know of no reason why our purposes in uttering (8) and (9) wouldn't be equally well served by quantifying over objects of belief* rather than of belief: e.g. 'No one can perceive an object without coming to believe* various things about it' ; here the 'things' quantified over are not propositions, but sentences in an internal system of representation. Of course, we could accept this reformulated version of (9) in our psycho? logical theory only if we incorporated the inner representation hypothesis explicitly into the theory. I think that by now the asterisks have become tiresome: so let us intro? duce the terminological convention that the word 'believes' is to be used in the way that I have heretofore used 'believes*'. On this way of talking, the objects of belief are sentences or sentence-analogs, and these sentences or sentence-analogs have content or meaning. Contrary to the suggestion</page><page sequence="30">38 HARTRY H. FIELD in the first paragraph of Section I, this way of talking does not really remove Brentano's problem: that problem rearises as the problem of giving a materialistic account of having content. Unless such an account of content can be given, much of what we say about belief (e.g. that cer? tain beliefs are about Caesar, that certain beliefs are true, and so forth) makes no sense at all. I have however suggested, at the end of Section I, that the problem of giving a materialistic account of content seems manageable: one way to manage it is to give a Tarski-like account of truth, supplemented by a theory of reference. My use of the word 'believes' to mean 'believes*' does not accord very well with the use of the term 'believes' in English: in English 'believes' is pretty much synonymous with 'believes that', and we can say even of organisms who know no English that they believe that snow is white. Let us then introduce a new technical term, 'believes that', which will serve the purposes that 'believe' and 'believe that' serve in English: let us say that a person 'believes that p' (where '/?' abbreviates an English sentence S) if that person believes some sentence in his system of internal representation whose translation into English is S. In effect then 'believes that' is to be used for a relation between organisms and English sentences. It must be realized that the notion of translation employed in the definition of 'believes that' is a loose and sloppy one. For even those of us who are hostile to Quine's radical indeterminacy thesis are bound to recognize that translation between languages of very different structure or expressive power is highly indeterminate. (Part of the reason is that a sentence in language Lx need not have exactly the same meaning as any sentence in language L2, so that a translator of Lx into L2 has to settle for approximate sameness of meaning; and which approximation one picks depends on complicated pragmatic considerations.) Since the notion of believing that is to be applied to organisms whose system of internal representation is doubtless quite different from ours - e.g., chimpanzees, Martians, and (if Whorff is right) humans whose spoken and written language differs significantly from ours - then it would be absurd not to recognize that the translation involved in the definition of 'believes that' is highly indeter? minate. For this reason the notion of 'believing that' defined above is itself a highly indeterminate notion, and consequently it is a notion that we ought to avoid in our psychological theorizing.29 Instead, we should use</page><page sequence="31">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 39 the notion of believing (i.e., believing*), together perhaps with various semantic notions applied to the sentences believed. (Another reason for avoiding use of 'believing that' (as defined above) in our psychological theories has already been mentioned in Section I - cf. (B) on p. 20.) I have introduced conventions about the use of 'believes' and 'believes that' according to which the first term relates organisms to sentences in their own system of representation and the second relates organisms to sentences in English. These terminological conventions are not intended to rule out the possibility that we need propositions in the analysis of belief and desire: it may be that we need propositions in our account of meaning for the sentences that are believed and desired. My own view however is (a) that talk of propositions is best avoided (except as a dispensable manner of speaking) unless it can be shown to serve purposes that cannot be served otherwise; and it is doubtful that this condition is met (b) that such talk commits us to semantic theses which (indepen? dently of ontological scruples) may well be false. Let's take (a) first. That one should not posit entities needlessly is, I take it, uncontroversial : to do so would be to indulge in "unfounded ontological speculation". And that there is no particular need to intro? duce propositions - at least, no need to introduce propositions construed in terms of possible worlds - was implicit in my discussion at the end of Section I. There I argued that if one wanted to use the idea of possible worlds, and if one construed a proposition as a set of possible worlds, then the correlation of a particular proposition with a sentence posed no problem as long as we had an adequate truth-theoretic semantics for the language. Another way of putting this point is that talk of propositions adds nothing of semantic interest; everything that is semantically of interest is already there in the truth-theoretic semantics. (I'm speaking of course of a truth-theoretic semantics that assigns properties rather than sets to predicates.) In other words, instead of saying that a person is related to the set of possible worlds in which Russell was hairless (or to some fine-grained proposition constructed out of possible worlds), why</page><page sequence="32">40 HARTRY H. FIELD not say instead that he is related to a sentence that consists of a name that stands for Russell copulated with a predicate that stands for hairlessness ?29a One might try to respond to this question by holding (implausibly, I think) that names are non-rigid designators. But this response, while adequate to the question just asked, does not undercut the point I am trying to make (as has in effect been observed already, in note 16). For if 'Russell' is non-rigid, then to believe that Russell was hairless is to believe some sentence that contains a definite description, some sentence of the form 'G^xFx)' in which iF' is an individuating description of Russell and 'G' stands for hairlessness. A truth-theoretic analysis of this sentence contains all the semantic information that is contained in a possible world analysis; so why bring in possible worlds? Again, they seem to be excess ontological baggage serving no semantic role. Under (b) there are two points to be made. The first is that if one talks of propositions and also assumes that propositions must be explicable in terms of possible worlds, then one will be driven to postulate that proper names and theoretical terms like 'temperature' are non-rigid designators; and this postulate is controversial at best. The second point is that whether or not one adheres to the possible worlds approach, talk of propositions commits one to a general relation of synonymy, and it is not at all obvious that there is any such general relation. I will develop these points, especially the second one, in Section VI. Their upshot is that the postulate of propositions involves not only unfounded ontological speculation but highly controversial semantic speculation as well. To me both the ontological and the semantic claims that underlie the postulate of propositions seem far more dubious than the postulate of a system of internal representation, especially since this last postulate appears to be a necessary one for the solution of Brentano's problem. Let us say then that belief and desire are not attitudes toward proposi? tions, but toward meaningful sentences in a system of internal representa? tion. Presumably part of any adequate account of meaning for a system of internal representation is a truth-theoretic semantics; I will suggest in Section VI that there is another aspect of meaning as well. But first I would like to try to clarify the idea of a system of internal representa? tion.</page><page sequence="33">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 41 IV. REMARKS ON THE INNER REPRESENTATION HYPOTHESIS I have spoken of belief and desire as involving a system of internal repre? sentation; but I have allowed that in the case of organisms that have a genuine language, the system of internal representation might either be the language or include the language as a part.30 This combination of claims may seem puzzling: if the only representation is in natural language, why call it internal representation? If there is internal representation, what sense does it make to say that the representation is in a natural language? The answer to these questions lies in the distinction between types and tokens. I have talked of an organism as believing (i.e., believing*) sentence types. But I said in Section I that (neglecting the complication about core beliefs) a person believes a sentence-type if and only if he employs that sentence-type in an appropriate way in reasoning, deliberating, etc. ; and the only way to employ a sentence-type is to employ some of its tokens. Now, it is clear, that in order to believe (or core believe) a sentence I can't be required to employ spoken or written tokens of it: no one writes down all of his beliefs (or all of his core beliefs). Consequently, if I believe sentences of my language, what I employ has to include internal tokens of those sentences. That explains why, even if all representation is in natural languages, we have to speak of internal representation: some of the tokens are certainly internal. This brings us to the second question: does it make sense to speak of internal representation as representation in natural language! It makes sense if, and only if, it makes sense to speak of internal tokens as being of the same type as spoken or written tokens. One might argue that any claim of type-identity between internal tokens and spoken or written tokens is highly implausible: after all, it seems pretty absurd to suppose that there is much of a physical resemblance between internal tokens on the one hand and spoken or written tokens on the other. But this of course would be a very bad argument: after all, a spoken token can be said to be of the same type as a written token, and yet spoken and written tokens bear little physical resemblance to each other. My own view is that the issue of whether we speak of internal tokens as type-identical to spoken or written tokens is partly a verbal issue, but that there are interesting empirical questions that underlie it, of which the most important is the extent to which (and the manner in which) linguistic</page><page sequence="34">42 HARTRY H. FIELD development involves conceptual development. To put the point very vaguely: if (as seems to me quite likely) learning a first language involves extending an initial representational system to include an isomorphic copy of the language being learned, then I think it is quite natural to view the isomorphism as establishing a criterion of type-identity between internal tokens and spoken or written tokens. However, the issues here are pretty complicated. (See Harman [10] for an interesting discussion which more or less supports the pro-type-identity position, and Fodor [7] (Ch. 2) for an interesting discussion in support of the other side.) My sympathies are much more with Harman than with Fodor on this matter, but I will try to remain neutral on the question in the rest of the paper.31 But there are other questions that need to be considered. First, I have talked of 'internal tokens'. What kinds of entities are these? Presumably they are inner occurrences of some kind, but what kind ? Second, although I have begged off the question of what it is for an internal token to be of the same type as a spoken or written token, there is also the question of what it is for two internal tokens to be of the same type as each other; and since a psychological theory will clearly need to use the notion of type-identity between different tokens, this question cannot very well be ignored. Third, there is the question of syntactically characterizing internal tokens - what is it for an internal token to belong to a given syntactic category (e.g., what is it for it to be a sentence token) ? Again, we will need to appeal to syntactic characterizations of inner tokens in developing the psychological theory, so this question is a fairly pressing one. There are two possible strategies in dealing with such questions. The first strategy, which I think is the wrong one, is to try to answer the above questions prior to developing the psychological theory. Such a strategy is a bad one because it is hard to see how to carry it out without doing a great deal of neurophysiological speculation: e.g., we would apparently have to specify two neurophysiological properties Px and P2 and a neuro? physiological relation R, and say that an inner occurrence is an expression token if and only if it has P1 and is a sentence-token if in addition it has P2, and that two inner occurrences with property Px are of the same type if one bears R to the other. The task of specifying Pl9 P2 and R is certainly not a task we are equipped for in our current state of knowledge, and I don't see how we could ever become equipped for it prior to the develop? ment of psychological theory.</page><page sequence="35">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 43 The second strategy, which is the one I advocate, is to develop the syntax of the system of representations as part of the psychological theory: we can then use the psychological theory to give a functionalist answer to the questions raised above. That this is the right way to proceed seems com? pletely obvious : it is simply an instance of the general rule that psycho? logical theories ought to be construed functionally. Let me be a bit more explicit about what is involved in this functionalist approach. If one were to write out in detail a theory (f&gt; that postulates a system of inner representation, such predicates as 'jc is an expression token', 'x is a sentence-token', and 'x and y are expression-tokens of the same type' would either appear as primitives or be explicitly definable (within set theory or higher order logic) from other such syntactic primi? tives. Such syntactic primitives are to be included among the psychological primitives when we functionalize' (/&gt;: that is, a realization of &lt;f&gt; is to be an ?-tuple consisting of properties and relations corresponding to the syn? tactic predicates of the theory as well as to the more straightforwardly psychological predicates. If we 'functionalize' the theory in this way then the answers to the questions raised above can be read right off of the theory &lt;f&gt;.32 For instance, suppose for simplicity that 'x and y are tokens of the same type' is a primitive of &lt;/&gt;. If we want to know what it is for two internal occurrences in an organism X at a time t to be tokens of the same type, the answer is simple : c and d are tokens of the same type if and only if there is a physical relation R which is the appropriate component of a unique realization of &lt;f&gt; in X at t, and c bears R to d.33,3? (If 'x and y are tokens of the same type' is a defined term rather than a primitive, the answer is slightly more complicated; but again, it can be read right off of the theory.) The upshot is that there is no need in developing psychological theory to specify what R is; we can leave that to future neurophysiology. (Moreover, we can allow that there are different physical type-identity relations in different organisms.) The fact that we leave the question to future neurophysiology does not imply any unclarity in our theory: in some sense, the theory implicitly specifies what it is for two inner tokens in a system of representation to be tokens of the same type. There is one final point to be made about theories that postulate a system of internal representation. I have said that the syntax of a system of internal representation should be explicitly stated in a psychological theory of belief and desire. Should the semantics of the system of internal</page><page sequence="36">44 HARTRY H. FIELD representation also be stated as part of the psychological theory? That depends on what we want psychological theory for. If the task of psychol? ogy is to state (i) the laws by which an organism's beliefs and desires evolve as he is subjected to sensory stimulations, and (ii) the laws by which those beliefs and desires affect his bodily movements, then I think that it is clear we do not need to use the semantics of the system of representation in stating the psychological laws: the sentences in the system of internal representation might as well be meaningless as far as the psychology is concerned.35 This is not the only way to view a psychological theory - a broader conception of a belief-desire psychology will be suggested in the next section, and in it semantic notions would play a genuine role. But it is worth stressing the narrow kind of psychology at least momentarily. For we have seen that the syntax and type-identity conditions for a system of internal representation should be regarded as functionally characterized by a psychological theory in which they appear; and we can take that theory to be narrow psychology, that is, the kind of psychology that does not employ any semantic characterizations of the sentences in a system of representation. This is important, for it means that the syntax and conditions of type-identity for the system of representation could in principle be determined independently of any considerations about what the sentences in the system mean. V. TRUTH What would a theory of meaning for a system of internal representation be like? In Sections I and III I have hinted at one aspect of my views on this question: a theory of meaning for a system of internal representation must consist in part of a truth-theoretic semantics of a more-or-less Tarskian kind. If we do not give a theory of truth for the system of internal representation, we cannot make sense of the idea that some of our beliefs are true and others are false; and I think we do want to be able to make sense of this idea (for reasons to be sketched shortly). Moreover, the only kind of theory of truth that I have ever heard of which is not obviously deficient is the Tarskian kind. The upshot, then, is that we need to give a Tarski-type semantic theory for the system of internal representation. In a</page><page sequence="37">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 45 recent article to which I am in most respects very sympathetic, Gilbert Harman has questioned this: ... no reason has been given for a compositional theory of meaning for whatever system of representation we think in, be it Mentalese or English ([12], p. 286). Presumably however if the notion of truth makes any sense, then truth and meaning must be related in the following way: the truth of the sentence 'Caesar crossed the Rubicon' should follow from the meaning of the sentence together with the fact that Caesar crossed the Rubicon. In this sense a theory of meaning must include a theory of truth-condi? tions. And as far as I can see, the theory of truth-conditions has to be a compositional theory of roughly the type that Tarski made famous. Harman's critique of compositional semantics is based on an important insight. He points out in the article that there is a serious problem for those philosophers, like Davidson, who regard knowledge of truth-conditions as what is essential in semantics : Davidson would (presumably) say that the speaker understands [the sentence 'Snow is white'] by virtue of the fact that he knows it is true if and only if snow is white. The difficulty ... is that [for the speaker to know any such thing he] needs some way to represent to himself snow's being white. If the relevant speaker uses the words 'snow is white' to represent in the relevant way that snow is white,... Davidson's [theory] would be circular. And, if speakers have available a form of Mentalese in which they can represent that snow is white, so that the [theory avoids] circularity, there is still the problem of meaning for Mentalese (p. 286). But the moral to be drawn is that knowledge of truth-conditions is not what is important to the semantics of a system of internal representation. The theory must ascribe truth-conditions, not knowledge of truth-conditions, to the sentences of English or Mentalese; for if it doesn't ascribe truth conditions to these sentences it will not have given sense to talk of our beliefs as being true or false. I have assumed that we do want to make sense of the idea that some of our beliefs are true and others are false; I would also assume that we want to make sense of the idea that some of our beliefs are about Julius Caesar and that other of our beliefs are about quarks. It seems to me however that there is a serious question as to why we should want to make sense of these ideas. Is our desire to do so based on anything other than a naive metaphysics that has no place in a properly scientific account of the world?</page><page sequence="38">46 HARTRY H. FIELD That this question is not a silly one can be seen from a fact noted at the end of the previous section. If the task of psychology is to state (i) the laws by which an organism's beliefs and desires evolve as he is subjected to sensory stimulations, and (ii) the laws by which those beliefs and desires affect his bodily movements, then semantic characterizations of beliefs and desires are irrelevant to psychology: one can state the laws without saying anything at all about what the believed and desired sentences mean, or what their truth-condi? tions are or what their subject matter is. For instance, we might imagine a super-crude psychology that contained laws like the following: there is some connective '-&gt;' in the system of internal repre? sentation such that for all sentences Sx and S2 in the system, whenever a person believes rSx -&gt; SJ and desires S2 then he also desires S?. The connective '-&gt;' that satisfied this law might mean 'only if, that is, it might obey the truth-table for the conditional; but the fact that it obeys this truth-table is not something we need to say in stating the psychological laws.35a The psychology, since we are imagining it to be super-crude, might also contain laws like this : there is a privileged class of sentences in the system of repre? sentation, called the class of observation sentences, with the property that each sentence in the class has associated with it a particular type of sensory stimulation. Whenever a sensory stimulation of the appropriate type occurs, the organism believes the observation sentence. Intuitively, we might expect that if a particular observation sentence is associated in this way with the class of retinal stimulations that are characteristically caused by nearby rabbits, then the observation sentence means something like 'there are rabbits nearby' ; but even if this is true, the psychological theory need not say that it is true. Why then do we need to semantically characterize the sentences in the system of inner repre? sentation ? Why not simply say that belief and desire are relations between people and meaningless sentences? Saying this would preclude us from</page><page sequence="39">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 47 speaking of beliefs as being true or as being about rabbits, but would anything of scientific value be lost? Here is one answer to this question - not the whole story, I think, but the part of the story that is emphasized in the writings of such philosophers as Quine, Davidson, and Harman (and perhaps Lewis in [18]). Imagine that we find ourselves with a foreigner whose language we do not under? stand. A rabbit scurries by, in the foreigner's line of sight, and the foreigner raises his gun in its direction - by now we have rather overwhelming grounds for thinking that he believes that there is a rabbit nearby. But can we say so in the vocabulary of the narrow psychology considered heretofore? We can't say 'He believes the sentence...' (giving the name of the sentence): for we don't know his language. How about if we say instead 'He believes some sentence which is an observation sentence associated with sensory stimulations of type... (and which serves as evidence for syntactically related sentences according to laws..., and so forth)'. The difficulty is clear: only someone with a great deal of very detailed information about the psychology of our foreigner could fill in the blanks. A third possibility is much better: He believes some sentence of his language which plays ap? proximately the role in his psychology that the sentence 'There's a rabbit nearby' plays in mine. But this, it might be claimed, really involves a semantic notion ! For isn't it really just a long-winded way of saying He believes some sentence of his language that translates into my language as 'There's a rabbit nearby' ? And isn't translation a semantic notion? This answer does not satisfy me, for though it does definitely motivate the introduction of a notion of translation, it does not motivate the intro? duction of any non-translational semantic notions; that is, it motivates the introduction of a more-or-less36 semantic notion about the relation of one language to another, but it does not motivate the introduction of any semantic notions like 'true' or 'refers' which relate language to the world. No reason has been offered, it seems to me, for regarding another person as having beliefs that are true or about rabbits. The Quinean reply, I would imagine, is that we need such notions as truth in connection with</page><page sequence="40">48 HARTRY H. FIELD our own language (e.g., to state generalizations like 'Every sentence of the form "/? or not p" is true');37 and that we can then use the notion of translation that we have motivated on other grounds to carry over the truth concept to foreign languages. I do not want to discuss this Quinean reply here; but it seems to me rather weak, and I would like to do better. I think that the reason why we need to be able to apply semantic notions like truth and reference to the sentences that people believe and desire is that we hold the theory that people's beliefs are, in many circumstances, reliable indicators about the world; and the only way to state this theory is to use the notion of truth (and probably the notion of reference as well). Moreover, this theory is not a piece of gratuitous metaphysics that could easily be dispensed with: it is central to our getting information about the world, for we are constantly using our opinions about other people's beliefs in forming opinions about the world. The fact that a child believes that he has done something I won't like (a fact that can often be inferred from his behavior) gives good reason to think he has done something I won't like; the fact that most physicists believe that there are gravitational waves (a fact that can be inferred from reading a few physics books) is good reason for me to believe that there are gravitational waves ; and so forth. These inferences evidently proceed by means of certain reliability principles, principles that say under what conditions a person's beliefs about certain things are likely to be true. The principles we need are not easy to state : after all, the fact that a child believes in Santa Claus is not good reason for me to believe in Santa Claus, and the fact that most members of a certain religious cult believe that flying saucers will land on a certain farm in Arizona next month is not good enough reason for me to believe that flying saucers will land there. (I don't think that the failure of these inferences is due entirely to independent evidence as to the falsity of the conclusion.) We do evidently have a stock of reliability principles, though we can not explicitly formulate them; and one can imagine that they will someday be systematized into an explicit theory. In a suitably broad sense, we might even regard this 'reliability theory' as part of psychology. What such a reliability theory would look like I do not know. My guess is that it would have to include not only the notion of truth but the notion of reference: for we want to be able to say in the theory that some people have very reliable beliefs about physics but very unreliable beliefs</page><page sequence="41">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 49 about the state of the economy, and so forth. We might imagine then that 'true', 'refers', etc. are primitives of the theory. If we do that - and if we imagine that the reliability theory is elaborated with such detail and precision that it is uniquely realized in each of the organisms to which the theory is intended to apply - then we could use this theory to give a functional account of truth and reference for systems of internal repre? sentation. Such a functional account would of course be desirable, for the reason that functional accounts are always desirable: it would allow for the possibility that the reference relation is realized by different physical relations in different organisms.38 VI. MORE ON THE SEMANTICS OF INTERNAL REPRESENTATION Is there more to the semantics of a system of internal representation than is given by truth-theoretic semantics? I think that there is; and I think that this casts considerable doubt on the possible worlds analysis of propositions, even independently of ontological considerations. In fact, I think it casts some doubt (independent of ontological considerations) on whether any notion of proposition is possible. In explaining these matters, I will begin by discussing the semantics of spoken and written languages, since I want to discuss some points that Quine has made in the context of them; but what I say will carry over to systems of internal representation. Many years ago Quine made the following observation: A lexicographer may be concerned with synonymy between forms in one language and forms in another or... he may be concerned with synonymy between forms in the same language. It is an open question how satisfactorily the two cases can be sub? sumed under a single general formulation of the synonymy concept... ([21] p. 56). The point that Quine is making here is very relevant to the question of propositions: if one postulates propositions one is assuming a positive answer to Quine's 'open question'. For if sentences mean propositions, then apparently two sentences are synonymous if they mean the same proposition; and this would be a general concept of synonymy, it would apply both intra-linguistically and inter-linguistically. Is Quine's 'open question' really open? Well, at least this much is true: intralinguistic synonymy seems a lot easier to define than interlinguistic synonymy. (Similarly, intraspeaker synonymy is easier to define than interspeaker synonymy, suggesting that there might be still further</page><page sequence="42">50 HARTRY H. FIELD divergence in the synonymy concept.) That intralinguistic synonymy is easier to define than interlinguistic synonymy at least for what Quine calls occasion sentences is a point that Quine argues in Sections 9 and 11 of [22] : he points out that the difference in meaning between 'Everest' and 'Gaurisanker' (construed as one-word sentences) for a certain speaker is revealed by the fact that different sensory stimulations would prompt him to assent to one than to the other; and that the difference in meaning of these one-word sentences in a given linguistic community is revealed by the fact that these sentences are intra-subjectively non-synonymous for most members of that community. Now, it seems to me that this talk of 'prompting to assent' is much too behavioristic, and leads Quine into unnecessary worries, e.g., about "stimulations of second intention" (verbal stimulations like "Assent to one-word sentences that begin with 'E' or I'll beat your brains out") - cf. [22] pp. 48-49. Nevertheless, it seems to me that Quine's general point is correct: we can explain intra? linguistic differences of meaning by evidential considerations. I have de? veloped this point elsewhere,39 using a non-behavioristic (but, I admit, idealized) conception of evidence ; and in addition to solving such hum? drum difficulties with Quine's approach as the second-intention problem, it also obviates the need for restricting the account to occasion sentences. What is interesting about this approach I think is that it gives you dif? ferences of meaning where you would intuitively expect them, but where you do not get them on the possible worlds approach (without adopting implausible assumptions about non-rigid designation). For instance, the following pair of sentences come out equivalent in meaning on the pos? sible worlds approach: (10) Everest is Gaurisanker comes out equivalent to (11) Everest is Everest ; and (12) Temperature is mean molecular energy comes out equivalent to40 (13) Temperature is temperature. But it should be pretty clear, even without looking up the details of my</page><page sequence="43">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 51 account, that these equivalences will not hold on any sufficiently sophisti? cated evidential criterion of intraspeaker synonymy, even for speakers who believe the sentences (10) and (12). Such evidential considerations (coupled with truth-theoretic considera? tions if the latter are not redundant41) seem to me to provide a very natural account of intra-speaker synonymy. For inter-speaker synonymy however the situation is quite different, for here it is very hard to formu? late any evidential criteria for two words differing in meaning. The source of the difficulty is clear: you and I may disagree about what counts as evidence for a certain sentence, not because that sentence means some? thing different to you than it means to me, but because of differences in the rest of our beliefs. One might try to find some rule of the form 'If there is an evidential difference of such and such a kind between your sentence and mine, then they differ in meaning' ; this is the task that Quine refers to as "trying to strip away the effects of collateral information". Quine has cast considerable doubts on the possibility of carrying out this task ([22], Section 9), and I think that if you look at the question in terms of my formal model in [6] you will find that Quine's doubts are reinforced. It seems to me that the criteria of inter-linguistic synonymy we actually employ are, almost exclusively, the criteria provided by truth-theoretic semantics.42 This is not quite true; when there are two sentences Sx and S2 in one language that are equivalent from the point of view of truth theoretic (or possible world) semantics, but which differ evidentially, and when there is a sentence S3 in another language that is truth-theoretically equivalent to both S? and S2 but is much more similar evidentially to Si than to S2, then we regard it as definitely a mistake to translate S3 as S2 - the translation Sx seems required. But except in such cases, little if any inter-subjective sameness of evidential role is required; if the Martians have singled out Everest, i.e., Gaurisanker, by their powerful telescopes and have named it 'Schrdlu', we would translate their name 'Schrdlu' by 'Everest' or by 'Gaurisanker' indifferently, however much we might want to say that 'Everest' and 'Gaurisanker' differ in meaning for us. One might object to this argument by saying that translation is a loose and pragmatic notion: the true situation (one might say) is that 'Schrdlu' differs in mean? ing both from 'Everest' and from 'Gaurisanker' ; we translate the name indifferently by 'Everest' or by 'Gaurisanker' because these approximate 'Schrdlu' about equally well. I sympathize with this response, except for</page><page sequence="44">52 HARTRY H. FIELD one thing: it assumes that there is some clear notion of inter-linguistic difference in meaning between words that refer to the same thing, and that is what I think needs to be established. My view then is that truth-theoretic semantics - i.e., possible world semantics without the possible worlds - is almost enough, but that there are certain very fine-grained distinctions of meaning that it cannot explain. These fine-grained distinctions of meaning seem to be clearly drawable only intra-linguistically, and that fact appears to make the notion of proposition suspect. It should be clear that these remarks about synonymy between sentences in public languages apply also to synonymy between sentences in systems of internal representation. It should also be clear that to define the evi? dential differences between sentences in the same system of internal repre? sentation, one does not need to employ any concepts that go outside psychology in the narrow sense. Consequently there seems to be no special problem in motivating the introduction of such evidential con? siderations into a semantic theory for the system of inner representation, in a way that there did seem to be a special problem of motivating the introduction of truth-theoretic concepts. I want to conclude this paper by raising what I regard as an open ques? tion: what connections are there between a theory of meaning for a system of internal representation and a theory of meaning for a spoken or written language?43 According to one influential approach44 to the theory of meaning for spoken and written languages, the meaning of a sentence in such languages is to be explained in terms of beliefs (or desires, etc.) that are conventionally correlated with the sentence. Roughly, to know the meaning of 'Caesar was egotistical' is to know that this sen? tence is conventionally correlated with the belief that Caesar was ego? tistical; and similarly for every other sentence in one's public language. (The conventional correlation must be spelled out recursively, of course.) This approach presupposes that one can explain what it is to believe that Caesar was egotistical without relying at any point on the semantic features of the sentence 'Caesar was egotistical' in one's spoken or written language: for if one relied on the semantic features of the spoken or written sentence in one's account of the belief, then to explain the meaning of the sentence in terms of the belief would involve a circularity. So a crucial question is whether that presupposition is correct.</page><page sequence="45">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 53 Putting the presupposition in terms of internal representation, it is this: that one can explain what it is for a sentence in the internal system of representation to mean that Caesar was egotistical without relying in one's explanation on the fact that certain words and phrases in the public language stand for Caesar or that certain other words and phrases in the public language stand for the property of being egotistical. If this pre? supposition is correct, then the above approach to the theory of meaning is quite attractive: if worked out, it would reduce all questions about the semantics of the spoken or written language to the corresponding ques? tions about the semantics of the system of internal representation; and those questions could then be answered without further reference to language. I am inclined to doubt however that the presupposition is true. My guess is that in a typical case, part o/what makes a symbol in my system of internal representation a symbol that stands for Caesar is that this symbol acquired its role in my system of representation as a result of my acquisition of a name that stands for Caesar in the public language. If something of this sort is true, it would appear to defeat45 the above approach to a theory of meaning for a public language. I believe however that the issues here are quite complicated, and deserve a great deal of further study. An opposite approach to the theory of meaning would be to try to reduce the semantics of the system of internal representation to the semantics for public language. To do this would be to assume that al? though dogs, chimpanzees, etc. might have systems of internal repre? sentation which played an important role in the explanation of their behavior, these systems of representation would not be ones to which notions like meaning and truth applied: such semantic notions could be applicable only to the representational systems of organisms with a spoken or written language. To me, such a conclusion seems very im? plausible. It may nevertheless be that there is something to this approach, for it may be that certain aspects of meaning can be explained more directly for public language than for systems of internal representation. The suggestion is not that these aspects of meaning can be explained without reference to beliefs and desires, for two reasons. In the first place, in explaining the fact that the public word 'Caesar' referred to Caesar one could appeal freely to certain sorts of beliefs and desires, e.g., those beliefs and desires that a languageless organism could possess; for we</page><page sequence="46">54 HARTRY H. FIELD have granted that such beliefs and desires can be accounted for in a language-independent way. In the second place, there is an important sense in which one could appeal to other beliefs and desires as well in our semantic theory for public language: we could appeal to beliefs and desires construed as attitudes towards internal sentences all we liked; the only restriction would be on which semantic features of those internal sentences we appealed to. I do not want to draw any very definite conclusions from this last dis? cussion. I merely want to say that it may well be necessary to develop the semantic theory for internal languages and the semantic theory for public languages together rather than developing one kind of semantics independently of the other and reducing the other kind to it. The reduction? ist strategy (particularly the strategy that tries to reduce public semantics to internal semantics) is worth pursuing, but alternative strategies are worth pursuing as well. University of Southern California NOTES * I have greatly benefitted from discussion on these issues with Janet Levin, Brian Loar, and Stephen Schiffer. The latter two especially, by their relentless criticism of the way I expressed my ideas in conversation, have forced me to write a very much better paper than I would otherwise have written. I am also grateful to Ned Block, Tyler B?rge, Michael Devitt, Keith Donellan and David Hills for helpful comments on an earlier version. 1 See for instance Armstrong [1], Ch. 3, and Putnam [20]. 2 Brentano's problem is discussed by Chisholm in [2], Ch. 11 ; references to Brentano can be found there. 3 See Stalnaker [25]. Lewis' remarks on functionalism are scattered throughout various writings; see [14], [15], [17], [18], and [19]. 4 See Quine [22], Section 45. 5 Believing* is thus different from believing true: a foreign speaker can believe an English sentence true while having no idea what it means, e.g., if he sees a headline in the N. Y. Times. To believe a sentence S true (i.e., to believe that S is true) is, if (1) is right, to believe* a sentence S* which means that S is true. Believing true involves the concept of truth; believing* does not. 6 The Banach-Tarski theorem says roughly that a solid sphere can be decomposed into a finite number of disjoint 'pieces' in such a way that the 'pieces' can then be put back together again to form two solid spheres the same size as the original one.

Dennett seems to regard the introduction of the notion of core-believing as an ad hoc device to save stored-sentence approaches from the absurdity of requir? ing infinitely many sentences to be stored: but the following discussion will show I think that the notion can be given strong independent motivation. 10 To spell this out more fully, we'd need first to spell out the characteristic role of beliefs (as opposed to say desires) in reasoning, deliberating, and so on - call this characteristic role Role B. Then the materialistic view of believing* that I am suggest? ing is roughly that in each believer there is some kind of physical storage of sentences such that the things stored in that way and their obvious consequences are the things that have Role B. 11 The 'almost' appears to be needed here because of the non-transitivity of 'is an obvious consequence of. I doubt that there are any clear cases of believing that either Russell was hairless or snow is white but not believing that if Russell was not hairless then snow is white; but I regard this as more or less analogous to the fact that there are no clear cases of numbers n such that some individuals with less than n hairs are bald but no individual with n or greater hairs is bald. I would not want to assert that because there are no clear cases of such numbers, there are no such numbers, because that would lead to a Sorites paradox. Similarly, I would not want to assert that because there are no clear cases of believing p and believing an ob? viously equivalent proposition q, there are no such cases; for that would lead by Sorites-like reasoning to the conclusion that one can't believe/? and yet not believe the unobviously equivalent claim r. 12 The acceptance of indeterminacies of the kind mentioned here is a minor con? cession to an instrumentalistic view of ordinary belief talk, but only a minor one; for even if it does not always make sense to ask whether a belief-ascription is true or false, we have seen no reason to deny that a core-belief ascription is always true or false; and that is close enough. (Another minor concession to an instrumentalistic view of our ordinary belief talk will be made in Section III). 13 See for instance Fodor [7] and Harman [11], Ch. 4, Section 2. 14[5] 15 [3] 16 I have assumed in this paragraph that proper names are always rigid designators. Some people however deny this: they believe that when we use the name 'Bertrand Russell' we associate with this name a property &lt;f&gt; which we think picks out Russell uniquely; and that when we say 'Bertrand Russell is hairless', what we say is true at a world w if and only if there is exactly one thing in w with property ^ in w, and that thing is hairless in w. (The thing with &lt;/&gt; in w need not be the thing with &lt;/&gt; in the actual world, i.e., it need not be Russell.) I find this doctrine that names can denote non rigidly quite implausible; but the point I am making in the paper could be generalized so as to allow for names to be non-rigid designators for anyone who finds that desirable. To see this, reflect on how we would associate a property &lt;j&gt; with a name. The only way I can see to do that is to associate with that name some expression (in a natural language or in a system of internal representation) which stands for that property. What the advocate of non-rigid designation is saying, then, is that when we utter the sentence 'Bertrand Russell is hairless', that sentence merely serves to</page><page sequence="48">56 HARTRY H. FIELD abbreviate the sentence (or sentence-analog) that we really mean, which is some? thing of the form 'There is exactly one thing x such that ?/?(*), and x is hairless'. Truth-at-a-possible-world can then be defined for the sentences (or sentence-analogs) that we really mean, by the process described in the text; and we can say that deriva? tively, a sentence S containing the name 'Bertrand Russell' is true at w if and only if the associated sentence (or sentence-analog) that we really mean when we utter S is true at w. 17 I don't really mean to be assuming that the primitive symbols in the sentence analogs are names or predicates; who knows what they are. All that the account I am suggesting assumes is that whatever problems of (actual world) reference such symbols raise are soluble in a materialistically acceptable manner. 18 I should add that the difficulty of constructing an alternative account of a relation between people and propositions is especially acute if one takes propositions to be fine-grained. 19 Lewis certainly believes this, and I suspect that Stalnaker does too. 20 This is true even of non-materialist functionalists; they too require realizations of psychological properties, they merely allow that the realizations be non-physical. (Only an instrumentalistic functionalist would deny the requirement of realizations entirely.) 21 [14], [15], and [17]. 21a I do not impose Lewis's requirement that &lt;j&gt; be a common sense psychological theory. But if you want to add that (to my mind pointless) requirement, you may: the argument of this section of the paper will not be affected. The restriction to common sense psychological theories might interfere with a pro? posal to be made later on : that we explicitly build the postulate of a system of internal representation into &lt;l&gt;. At first blush this would seem to conflict with letting &lt;j&gt; be a common sense theory, since common sense would not appear to be committed to systems of internal representation. However, Lewis is rather generous in what he regards common sense committed to : he does not regard the fact that a theory postu? lates possible worlds other than our own as going against the requirement that it say only what is common sense. I believe that systems of internal representation are at least as close to being postulates of common sense as are possible worlds. I have said that I think that the requirement that &lt;/&gt; be a common sense theory is pointless. I also think that it is harmful. For one thing, it is not at all clear that any of the common sense theories of belief are (or even come close to being) uniquely realized; the only way to get anything like unique realization may be to invoke non common-sense suppositions. It may well be for instance that only a theory of belief that explicitly postulates a system of internal representation can come anywhere near to being uniquely realized. But I do not want to press this point here: the argument of this section goes through even if &lt;f&gt; itself does not postulate a system of internal representation or in any other way (apart from propositions!) strain the bounds of common sense. 22 Lewis' own account of what realizations are is strictly speaking inaccurate because he does not take the precaution I've recommended: as his account stands, something can serve as a realization of pain only if it realizes pain in all organisms at all times, thus depriving functionalism of its point, (cf. Harman [11], Ch. 3, Section 4). But it is clear that what I have suggested (which is equivalent to what Harman suggests) is what Lewis really had in mind.</page><page sequence="49">MENTAL REPRESENTATION 57 23 Here I oversimplify: we might imagine that Tu...,Tn include non-psychological terms that are needed in the theory; and we might also imagine that some psycho? logical terms needed in the theory are not included among Tu..., Tn, because their reference is fixed independently of 4&gt;. 24 For reasons not relevant to the present paper, Lewis finds it convenient to imagine that the theory has been rewritten so that all the psychological terms are names. I have chosen not to do this, and the features of the next paragraph that do not look quite like anything explicitly in Lewis result from this fact. The conclusion I will derive however would have been forthcoming on his procedure as well. 25 "I take states to be attributes of a special kind: attributes of things at times" ([14], p. 165). When Lewis says that 'pain' refers to a state he does not of course mean that it refers to what might be called a state-token, that is, an individual inner occurrence (an occurrence of the type that the organism feels when it 'feels pain'). Nor does he mean what might be called a state type: a. sortal property of such inner occurrences, a property that might be expressed by the predicate 'is a pain'. Rather, pain is taken to be an attribute of organisms, the attribute that is expressed by 'feels pain', (cf. [14], footnote 1). I think myself that the word 'state' is best reserved for what I've called state-tokens and state-types; for Lewis' use of the term helps foster a confusion between states in his sense and state-types in mine, and this can lead to a disastrous confusion to be noted later in this section. (Lewis himself does not fall into the confusion, as footnote 13 of [17] shows, but I think his terminology has led others to make it.) 26 Strictly speaking, it might be better to leave out the word 'physical' here: that way if materialism is only contingently true, then we can allow organisms in those possible worlds in which &lt;/&gt; is realized by irreducibly mental properties to have func? tional properties. This change in the definition of functional property would in no way affect the application of functional properties to organisms in those worlds where materialism is true; in particular, it would not affect the application of functional properties in the actual world, if as I am assuming materialism is indeed true. Since my own interest lies wholly in the actual world, my addition of the word 'physical' does no harm. I chose to put in the word 'physical' partly to remind the reader of the materialist premise, and partly as a convenient way to introduce distinctions of order. In order for the method of defining properties employed in (2) to make sense (and not lead to paradoxes), the functional property being defined cannot be one of the properties in the range of property-quantifier. If we use the notion of 'physical property' narrowly, so that functional properties like those defined in (2) do not themselves count as physical, then this condition is met. On this narrow use of the term physical, the materialist thesis is that all non-functional properties are physical. 27 The uniqueness requirement is Lewis'. I think that it must be taken with a grain of salt, but I do not have the space here to explain my reservations or to develop the machinery needed to avoid it. (The word 'unique' in (2) cannot merely be dropped.) 28 According to Lewis, 'the property of pain' and 'pain' refer to different proper? ties: 'the property of pain' refers to a functional property, and 'pain' refers (in the context of discussing a specific organism X at a specific time /) to the non-functional property which realizes the functional property in X at t. I have tried to remain neutral on the question of whether 'pain' refers to the functional property or refers (in a context-dependent way) to a realization of it.</page><page sequence="50">58 HARTRY H. FIELD 29 This is not intended as an argument against using a notion of believing that which relates people to propositions, but only as an argument against using a notion which relates people to English sentences (or to utterances of English sentences). A theory involving propositions is exempt from the criticism, since if there are propositions at all then presumably there are propositions not expressible in English. (However, even if 'believes that' relates people to propositions, it is not clear that sentences attributing particular beliefs to organisms very unlike us could ever be literally true.) 29a Some people may feel that there is no ontological gain in quantifying over proper? ties rather than over propositions. Such a person should read Putnam [20]. Putnam makes a good case (a) that quantification over properties is needed in science, and (b) that properties are quite distinct from meanings, in that two predicates like '* has temperature 210? C and '* has mean molecular energy 10"20 joules' can turn out to stand for the same property even though they clearly differ in meaning. 30 I have allowed this by allowing for the possibility that the sentences which are believed be genuine sentences in a genuine language, rather than sentence analogs. 31 Where neutrality of formulation is difficult to achieve without verbosity, I have frequently sacrificed the neutrality; but even in these cases it is not difficult to re? phrase what I say so as to accord with the position that I am temporarily excluding. 32 This assumes that the syntactic theory is formulated in such a way that all syn? tactic predicates are predicates of tokens. To assume this is not to assume that the syntax can be given nominalistically, i.e., without quantifying over abstract entities like sets, or even like sequences which can be intuitively regarded as having more or less the role of expression-types. Once this is realized, the task of formulating the syntactic theory in the way required presents no difficulty. Incidentally, I should remark that the syntactic theory can be formulated in such a way as to allow wide diversity in the grammars of the systems of representation of organisms to which the theory is intended to apply. (One way in which it might do this is to postulate a general system of syntactic categories. Different sub-sets of this general system could be instantiated in different organisms to which the theory applies, and in this way a wide syntactic diversity in systems of representation would be compatible with the general theory. See Lewis [16] for an illustration of the kind of general syntax I have in mind.) 33 Incidentally, R could perfectly well be a disjunctive relation, say of the form 'Either x and y are both occurrences in the left hemisphere of the brain and x bears Pi to y, or x and y are both occurrences in the right hemisphere and x bears R2 to y, or one is an occurrence in the left and the other in the right and the one in the left bears R3 to the one in the right'. Disjunctive realizations are needed for other func? tional theories - e.g., it is perfectly possible that pain is realized in a given organism at a given time by a disjunctive property like 'is a stimulation of the C-fibers or a firing of the Z-neurons' - and there is no reason to rule out the same flexibility in the theory of belief and desire. I make this point because I think that a main reason why many philosophers resist the inner representation hypothesis is that they tend to exaggerate its neurophysiological commitments. 34 This only defines what it is for two tokens in the same organism to be of the same type; but the notion of type-identity between tokens in one organism and tokens in the other is not needed for psychological theory, and can be regarded as a meaningless notion. 35 I will elaborate on this point in the next section.</page><page sequence="51">CENTAL REPRESENTATION 59 36a The proposed iaw' involving '? ' is of course exceptionally crude: to get any? thing that looks at all plausible, one probably has to bring in something like degrees of belief and degrees of desirability. But the point I am making is unaffected: the degrees of belief and degrees of desirability can be regarded as attaching to sentences, and laws can be given relating the degrees of belief and desirability of a sentence of the form r5i ? SJ to the degrees of belief and desirability of the component sen? tences Si and S2 and of other compound sentences containing Si and S2. (E.g., if B is degree of belief, one law might be that B(Si -+ S2) &gt; max{B(S2), 1 - B(Si)}). At no point do the meanings of the component sentences or of the logical connectives need to be mentioned. 36 I think that there is some question as to whether the notion of translation, used in the very loose and pragmatic way just explained, ought to count as a genuinely semantic notion; hence the 'more or less'. 37 Cf. Quine [23], p. 11. 38 Without a functional account, we can in a sense recognize this: we can let 'refers' stand for a certain physical relation in connection with organisms of one kind (say, organisms that speak some language of a certain general type), and also let 'refers' stand for a different physical relation in connection with organisms of another type; but without a functional account we do not have the means to explain what these two uses of 'refers' have in common. (Similarly for 'true'.) 39 [6]. 40 Strictly, this equivalence holds only on the coarse-grained possible worlds ap? proach. But we could imagine that a one-word phrase 'glub' had been introduced into the language by the stipulation that it was to (rigidly) denote the property of mean molecular energy; then 'Temperature is glub' would be equivalent to (13) even on the fine-grained possible worlds approach, but they would clearly be non-synony? mous. 41 Whether they are redundant depends on whether one treats evidential considera? tions in a fine-grained or a coarse-grained manner; see [6], pp. 396-397. 42 Our criteria for inter-speaker but intra-linguistic synonymy are less clear: some? times we treat this case like the inter-linguistic case, and sometimes we use the common language to extend considerations of intra-speaker synonymy across different speakers. 43 Here I am concerned primarily with the truth-theoretic aspects of meaning. Also, the question I am asking does not really presuppose what the formulation in the text suggests, that a person's system of internal representation is distinct from his public language. If we adopt the opposite presupposition, we can phrase the question as follows : in what ways if any does one need to bring in the fact that a system of internal representation is also used publicly, in giving a complete theory of truth conditions for the system of internal representation; and in what ways does one need to bring in the fact that a public language is used for thinking, in giving a complete theory of meaning for it. 44 See Schiffer [24]. Lewis' approach in [19] is quite similar. Harman's suggestion in [9] that the "level 2 theory of meaning" presupposes the "level 1 theory of mean? ing" but not conversely seems to involve a similar idea. 45 It might not defeat it, if as suggested at the end of Section V we give a functional account of reference: for then we could grant that we need to specify the use of the word 'Caesar' in public language in order to specify a realization for the reference</page><page sequence="52">60 HARTRY H. FIELD relation as applied to the system of internal representation, but hold that we do not need to mention it in the functional theory itself. However, it does not seem to me at all obvious that we do not need to mention the public use of words in a satisfactory functional theory of truth-conditions for systems of internal representation; it seems to me that no one has developed any such theory in anywhere near enough detail for us to tell. It may well be for instance that a fairly detailed causal account of reference has to be explicitly built into reliability theory (or whatever other kind of broad psychological theory it is in which the notion of reference or of truth-conditions appears), and that such a detailed causal theory will have to explicitly mention acquisition of a public word that refers to something as one of the mechanisms by which people can become causally related to an object in the way that is relevant to having beliefs about the object.
