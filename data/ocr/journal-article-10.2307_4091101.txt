<plain_text><page sequence="1">Editor's Notes Since the earliest myths of human creation there have been parallel tales of variously constituted synthetic creatures, now all lumped together in the public consciousness under the generic category "robot." While we were growing up these "amazing marvels" were the stuff of the comics, of the Saturday matinee. And even now they are at the center of the proliferating sci-fi market. Of interest to Design Quarterly is the fact that the so-called "mechanical man" (they're most often referred to as male) is no longer intriguing fiction, but an actor in life's daily drama. As the robot becomes more visible, more acceptable to us emotionally, we will no doubt raise more penetrating questions about its appearance-its physical presence. Should its form follow its function, or should we continue to enclose its mechanism in a semi- human skin? Will we learn to interact with these inevitably intelligent machines-at this time they are by definition reprogrammable, but they will soon become self-programmable-only if they come in an androgynous skin? To prepare us for things to come Michael Webb provides a history of the robot through myth, literature and film: he defines the essential terms of robotics and outlines the evolution of robot imagery. He then follows with a description of current applications of the science of robotics to industry and medicine. Webb's essentially literary view is followed by the more immediately practical one of Arthur Harkins, who describes currently available "personal robots" (PRs) and their future in society. He also discusses emerging forms of smart machines and the apparently limitless potential for interaction between ourselves and our future robot pals. Sometimes men build robots, sometimes robots build men. What does it matter, really, whether one thinks with metal or with protoplasm? As for myself, I can assume whatever substance and shape I choose-rather used to assume-for we no longer indulge in such trifles. Stanislaw Lem, The Cyberiad, 1967 Lem's "fables for a cybernetic age" casually embrace the idea that humans will some day be indistinguishable from robots. In a similar vein, Harkins points to the paradox of mechanical parts replacing organic ones in humans from such relatively routine examples as steel hip joints to the sophistication of Barney Clark's heroic mechanical heart. Evolving robot imagery arouses the continuing interest and participation of the art world. From the earliest descriptions of anthropomorphic machines-the Golem, Frankenstein, to Ernest Trova's Falling Man-our hostility to and fear of these heartless creatures has been reflected in their physical manifestations. Not until 1940 did we have a "good guy" robot, Isaac Asimov's Robbie. Only recently, as our relationship to the computer and its offspring has become more intimate, has it been possible to create genuinely lovable robots, such as George Lucas's R2- D2 and C-3PO. It may be significant that the more comfortable we become with them, the less humanoid they will need to be. With the advent of the personal robot it may be that our attitude toward the physicality of these potentially intelligent companions will allow us to change the way they look. We may no longer need to provide them with human trappings. Based on our experience with children and computers, coming generations will relate fearlessly and equally to artificial intelligences whether they come on a microchip or in the guise of an android.
