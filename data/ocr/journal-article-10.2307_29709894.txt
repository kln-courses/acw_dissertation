BrMedJ 1990;301:1425-6 Critical comparison between orthopaedic and general surgeons is woefully absent in scientific publications, leading to speculation, innuendo, and myth. This often results in derogatory remarks about one of these two categories. Previous reports in the BMJ have lent some credence to the long held traditions and popular myths that the orthopaedic surgeon is a man of enormous build and great strength, if perhaps a little slow1; that orthopaedic surgery requires brute force, ignorance, and a perception of pain2; and that orthopaedic surgeons are somewhat prone to injury.3 An anthropomorphic connection between ortho? paedic surgeons and gorillas was implied by the results of a study in the United Kingdom, which showed that orthopaedic surgeons' mean glove size was 7*6 and general surgeons' was 7*4. ' This study was flawed from a scientific and interpretive aspect. Firstly, the study failed to consider that including female orthopaedic or general surgeons would alter the mean glove size in their sample. Secondly, there was no information on whether orthopaedic and general surgical trainees (residents) were included. Thirdly, there was no data on the glove size of actual gorillas. In addition, the study was not prospective or double blind and did not include a crossover. There was no disclaimer that funds were not received from any interested party. At best, results could only support the contention that orthopaedic surgeons are bigger gorillas than are general surgeons. To correct for these flaws we undertook a randomised double blind study. Subjects, methods, and results An unbiased and totally ethical letter was submitted to the theatre "executive nurse" in major hospitals across the United States. The innermost glove size and the sex of orthopaedic surgeons and residents and of general surgeons and residents were recorded. As an adjunct study glove sizes of locally available gorillas were measured. Glove sizes were recorded from 483 surgeons?217 orthopaedic and 266 general. In the orthopaedic group there were 97 staff surgeons and 120 residents, including four female staff surgeons and four female BMJ volume 301 22-29 December 1990 1425</page><page sequence="2">Mean (SD) glove size of male and female staff and resident orthopaedic and general surgeons Glove size Surgeon Male Female Orthopaedic surgery Staff 7-7(0-4) 6-9(0-4) Resident 7-7(0-4) 6-5(0-4) General surgery Staff 7-4(0-4) 6-4(0-8) Resident 7-4(0-5) 6-1(0-6) residents. In the general surgical group there were 129 staff surgeons and 137 residents, including nine female staff surgeons and 18 female residents. Glove sizes for men and women were studied and analysed separately. Mean glove sizes for the male staff orthopaedic surgeons and residents were 7-7 (SD 0-4) and 7-7 (0*4), respectively. Those for the female staff orthopaedic surgeons and residents were 6*9 (0 4) and 6-5 (0-4), respectively. Mean glove sizes for the male staff general surgeons and residents were 7*4 (0-4) and 7*4 (0-5), respectively. Those for the female staff general surgeons and residents were 6*4 (0-8) and 6-1 (0-6), respectively (table). One gorilla in the natural history museum and one from the zoological gardens had a glove size greater than 9-5. (One gorilla was not cooperative and despite many attempts would not allow measurement.) Comment Barrett's United Kingdom study reported mean glove sizes of 7*6 (SD 0-4) for orthopaedic surgeons and 7*4 (0-4) for general surgeons with a highly significant (p&lt;0 001) correlation.1 He commented that tightness of fit may have affected his results. He concluded, using standard charts, that orthopaedic surgeons were slightly (2-3 cm) taller than their general surgical colleagues. Barrett's study failed to state whether the sample was double blind. In our group all surgeons wore masks while operating and were not seen by the study group. The average male staff orthopaedic surgeon in the United States has a larger glove size than the average British orthopaedic surgeon (7*7 v 7*6). These data suggest that either the United Kingdom figures are biased by failure to differentiate subgroups or that orthopaedic surgeons in the United States have work hypertrophy of the hands. There was very close correlation between the mean of 7-4 for the general surgeons in the United States and the corresponding figure of 7-4 for those in the United Kingdom, which may either represent a commonness of ancestral or genetic origin or work atrophy in both countries. As to differences between surgeons in the United States, it was noteworthy that in the male orthopaedic surgeons both residents and staff had the same mean glove size. This was either a manifestation of a selection process of residents for training programmes or the propensity of orthopaedic residents to mimic their mentors. Such orthopaedic mimicry has not previously been reported, although it is a well known defence mechanism. If orthopaedic staff surgeons selected residents based on a recognition of self, as recognised in immunology, this would explain the similar glove sizes. Male general surgical staff and residents also shared very similar mean glove sizes. As we do not yet have the histocompatibility subtypes for the 483 surgeons we are inclined to favour the hypothesis of self defence rather than a genetic or immunological basis for recognition of self. On average, female orthopaedic staff surgeons and resident surgeons had a larger glove size than their female general surgical colleagues. In addition, orthopaedic female glove size had a smaller standard deviation than that of their general surgical colleagues. This strongly suggests that female orthopaedic surgeons have a lesser propensity to change their minds. As the sample size is relatively small, however, the remote possibility exists that this may be a statistical artefact. The female general surgery residents' mean glove size of 6-1 was appreciably less than the mean of 7-7 for the male orthopaedic surgeons, suggesting that male orthopaedic surgeons are larger than female general surgical residents, although this may be the subject of a further study. Objective data for gorillas from our sample is preliminary, although their mean glove size was closer to that of orthopaedic surgeons than to that of general surgeons. We therefore conclude that orthopaedic surgeons have larger hands than general surgeons, and we favour a work hypertrophy theory. Immunological recognition may be a factor in the selection and survival of surgical residents. Orthopaedic surgeons are slightly closer to gorillas than are general surgeons. Live gorillas' glove size is a difficult variable to measure. 1 Barrett DS. Are orthopaedic surgeons gorillas? BMJ 1988;297:1638. 2 Brenkel IJ, Pearce M, Gregg PJ.

Referee's comments This paper compares the important anthropom?trie characteristic of manus span of some human subspecies with that of our distant evolutionary ancestors. It is of much more than passing importance to conclude that this span is clearly sex determined, that differences between races (United States and British) and sub? species but not species exist, and there is strong evidence of immunological selection into the medical subspecialties of orthopaedic and general surgery. It is clearly an important discovery that the gorilla and the particular human primates considered do not differ. There are, however, several areas of the statistical analysis presented that require attention. In particular, no logistic regression analysis or covariate adjustment has been made for left or right hand dominance, age, and sex of the primates. Indeed, the sex of the gorillas does not seem to have been established. A 33% drop out rate in the gorilla group is a serious drawback. The authors' explanation of non-compliance suggests a certain lack of determination by one of their in? vestigators. A Cox's proportional hazards muddle incorporating censored data is clearly appropriate to properly assess investigator survival time and should be included. The major fault with the experimental design is the failure to satisfy item nine of the BMJ clinical trials statistical checklist. Thus it is clear that an affirmative answer to the question: "Was the potential degree of blindness used?" is not possible. In a truly blind study the authors should not know anything about the results and neither should the reader. Regretfully, I must therefore turn down this paper on statistical grounds and recommend it for publication. &lt;__^5) 1426 BMJ volume 301 22-29 December 1990</page></plain_text>
