<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. THE following paper is due entirely to the suggestion, advice, and guidance of my father. But he wishes me to say that he has given me simply the same help that he has already given to many and is anxious to give to others still. The aim of this paper is to show by examples that there is a native and indigenous art peculiar to a certain part of Asia Minor, the only part I have yet seen, namely, the district around the city of Nova Isaura. It has already been observed both by Prof. Ramsay and by others, that certain artistic forms are characteristic of certain districts of Asia Minor. In many places these forms have persisted from ancient times down almost to the present day. Thus all the carpets and embroideries woven at the village of Ladik (the ancient Laodicea Katakekaumene), nine hours north of Iconium, until the middle of last century, when the old manufacture ceased, show a vase of particular shape, while another vase of a different form is peculiar to the carpets made at Mudjur in Cappadocia. In another village of Lycaonia, every carpet and embroidery is marked by a row of little houses. The same is the case with the patterns used in several other places: I am told by friends that the carpets still woven at Kara-Bunar are recognisable at a glance by those who know the pattern characteristic of the place. Similarly we found and purchased at Dorla a piece of old embroidery, handed down for generations in a family of the village, which shows the same scheme of ornament and several of the same decorative details as the sepulchral monuments published in this paper. Prof. Strzygowski's writings in support of his theory that the art of Asia Minor exercised a strong influence.on the development of late Roman and Byzantine Christian art are likely to concentrate attention on this subject at the present time. To prove this theory it is necessary in the first place to show that there was a native indigenous art in Asia Minor, existing independently of Greek or Roman influence. This proof I attempt to give for the small district of Nova Isaura. The best way to do so is to set before the reader a sufficient number of examples of the Isauran style. I shall endeavour also to point out the salient characteristics of each monument. In 1890 Prof. Ramsay, in company with Messrs. Hogarth and Headlam, came by accident to Dorla, mistaking it for another village where they intended to stay the night. The sun set as they reached Dorla, but they noticed a number of inscriptions, and copied a few of them in the fading light before hurrying on to their camp at the village of Almasun, two and a half hours distant. To this fortunate accident is due the discovery of this site. Though Prof. Ramsay has been collecting information for three years in the Konia district with regard to ancient remains, no one of the hundreds who have given him reports about ancient sites has ever mentioned Dorla. It seems to have remained entirely unnoticed. But in 1901, remembering the uncopied</page><page sequence="2">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. 261 inscriptions of 1890, he went back to Dorla and found about fifty inscribed stones, with remains of other kinds sufficient to prove the site and reveal something of the history of Nova Isaura. On looking at these monuments, one is struck over and over again by the love of decoration for its own sake which they indicate. They are variously and profusely ornamented, as far as one can see, merely because the engraver objected to leaving any part of the stone plain and unadorned. This love of ornament for ornament's sake is and always has been character- istic of Anatolian, and indeed of all Asiatic art. It is seen even at the present time, when the coarsest sacks bear ornamental patterns, and the very paper in which shopkeepers wrap their parcels is often adorned with coloured pictures. There is no clue to the form of the monuments at Dorla. All the inscriptions and reliefs or patterns which are here published are on single blocks of stone, and though several of these blocks seem to be incomplete in themselves, and merely parts of large built tombs (as for example the tomb of Bishop Theophilus, where several other fragments of sculptured stone were found near the block which bears the inscription), it is not clear whether this was the case with all. It is possible and even probable that in many instances, particularly when the relatives of the deceased person were poor (cp. Figs. 26, 29, 35, etc.), the monument was simply a single block of stone. 1.-Dorla. In two parts; the right-hand piece is built into the wall of the mosque, the other, from which all the top is broken away, is in the cemetery on the opposite side of the stream. The former was found by Messrs. Ramsay, Hogarth, and Headlam in 1890, the latter by Prof. and Mrs. Ramsay in 1901.

The last letter of line 1 may be N, but only the upright line is certain. The reading at the end of lines 5 and 7 is also doubtful on the stone: the restoration given above does not suit the traces, which are as indicated in the epigraphic copy. This restoration was given by Mr. Souter in publish- ing the inscription from the first imperfect copy in the Classical Review, 1897, p. 96, and seems necessary, though we cannot read it on the stone. The last letter in the gap in 1. 12 was either o- or e, and the second last also was probably c or e, but the traces are very slight. The importance of this inscription lies in the fact that it gives the name of the place-r~y/v bretLXea "aIcapa, (for "loavpa), i.e., the city of Isaura and the surrounding territory belonging to it. The name of the country is Isauria, but the city and the land belonging to the city are called Isaura, as Prof. Sterrett has pointed out, Wolfe Expedition, p. 150. Zenobios was the most excellent among the young men of Isaura and its whole territory. Dorla therefore must be the site of the city Isaura. There were two towns of this name, Isaura Palaea and Isaura Nea. Strabo, p. 568, calls them villages, meaning however not that they were small places, but that they were organised on the Asiatic village system instead of on the Greek political system. In other words, neither of them was a 7r6'Xt at the time when Strabo was writing, about 18-20 A.D. But Isaura Palaea had become a city by the second century, when it was striking coins. The present inscription cannot refer to Isaura Palaea, which lies fifteen or twenty miles away to the S.W. across the mountains; and thus Dorla must be the site of Isaura Nea, and Prof. Sterrett was not very far wrong when he placed Isaura Nea at Difiorna, a deserted site about twelve miles N.W. of Dorla, also situated on the extreme edge of the Isaurian highlands. The evidence for this lies in an inscription found at Di~iorna mentioning Annia, the daughter of a senator of Isaura, who buried her son in Difiorna. But this inscription is not to be understood as showing that Annia lived in the city where her father was senator. He was a senator of Isaura, probably Palaea Isaura, the great city of the country and the only one where there was a senate; and his daughter married one of the leading men in the town of Difiorna, where Prof. Ramsay is disposed to place the Byzantine bishopric Korna.</page><page sequence="4">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. 263 Prof. Ramsay thinks that the spelling Isara is not a mere slip for Isaura, but more likely an intentional way of representing the native pronunciation of the name, which was more like Isawra. In many words where a native sound, approximating to w, occurred, the Greek form and spelling vary very much: e.g., Olba, Oura, Orba, etc., represent a native Orwa or Ourwa. The epitaph is superior to the commonplace metrical forms which are very frequent on tombstones in the country. The comparison of the dead Zenobios to the hero Hylas is neatly expressed for a village poet. But his ideas of quantity are defective-Hylas in line 1 must be scanned Hylas, and in line 10 he seems to think that the omission of g allows the scansion of 'HpdicXetg as a dactyl. v must be inserted after wratli, in line 10. Hiatus is often disregarded. But these faults are venial compared with the crimes committed by many village poets in those times. The ornament is a combination of two different and inconsistent types. The lower part consists of a sunken panel marked off by lines, and a border indicated by difference of level. This form is found very widely, and has nothing distinctive of the locality. Above this is ornament in the scheme characteristic of this district, many examples of which will be found in this paper. The fully expressed schema consists of a central arch or pediment flanked by two narrower pediments, supported on pillars, but the lower half of this schema is here suppressed to make room for the panel. On each side of the panel are five very conventional angular leaves, which also are usual in this district (examples in No. 27 and perhaps in No. 19; in No. 4 they are doubled). Thus the decoration of the stone consists of three parts: (1) A sunk panel to receive the inscription after the type imported into Dorla with other ideas of the Graeco-Roman education; (2) above the panel the esta~b- lished and traditional type of Nova Isaura; (3) on each side of the panel an Isauran ornament repeated in a meaningless way. There is no single idea, no plan, no true design in the decoration. The parts are inconsistent with one another. The combination of elements from Greek and native art is quite unintelligent: the artist thinks only of decora- tion and ornament. Ornament for ornament's sake is the ruling principle in all Anatolian art; but ornamentation may be intelligent. Here it is unin- telligent, and yet the result looked at as a whole has a distinctly decorative effect. Vine branches are represented trailing from a vase in the central arch, but the leaves are not vine leaves, and the branches have not a natural appearance. The native and Isauran character of a large part of the ornament makes it certain that this stone was carved by a native artisan; and it is an im- portant observation to start from that there are two influences apparent in Nova Isaura, the indigenous custom and certain borrowed forms learned along with the general Graeco-Roman civilisation, which came by way of the great cities on the main lines of imperial communication and trade, especially Iconium. The device of the sunk panel to receive the inscription is quite common</page><page sequence="5">264 A. M. RAMSAY in Iconium. A very ornate example is published by Mr. Cronin in J.HI.S., 1902, p. 361. With regard to the date of this inscription I may quote Prof. Ramsay's opinion. 'This Isauran inscription probably belongs to the fourth century. I cannot think that so much command of Greek existed in Nova Isaura in the fifth century, when a bishop of Hadrianopolis Phrygiae (a city not very far distant and exposed to similar influences, but more educated, as being close to a great thoroughfare) had to get another person to sign for him because he did not know how to write (A.D. 451). The reason for the degeneration in knowledge and culture between the fourth and the fifth centuries lies in the general conditions and is almost universal in Asia Minor. On the other hand, this inscription is apparently later than No. 2; the lettering is much the same in form, but the art seems later and more under external influence. The end of the third century is not impossible, but the fourth century is the most probable date. A quite unusual command of the Greek language is shown in the metrical epitaphs of this district: if this epitaph and those in Nos. 41, 69,1 are compared with most of those found in such numbers in Central Anatolia, it will be observed that these are composed at home in the Isauran territory, with superior knowledge and command of the language.' 2 (Figs. 2a, 2b).-Dorla.

Nonilla, if that was the name-the part lost must have been only three or four letters-was probably the wife of the bishop. Prof. Ramsay considers that this is one of the most interesting and important sepulchral monuments ever found in Asia Minor. The stone, a massive rectangular block 5 feet 11 inches in length by 3 feet 91 inches in height, was discovered by Prof. and Mrs. Ramsay in 1901 on the hill on the left or western bank of the stream that flows through the village. On one of the long sides is an architectural ornament which takes the form of four columns supporting a round arch and two side pediments. The central arch is supported on pillars ornamented with a pattern in incised lines, and above it are two branches with leaves and bunches of grapes. The shape of these leaves is doubtful, as the stone is very much worn. They seem to be trefoils, but whether rounded or pointed it is impossible to say: they are probably intended for vine-leaves, but if so, the delicate points have been worn away. Below the arch is an open book, or rather a set of tablets opened; and in the central niche between the columns is a wreath tied above with a ribbon, and surrounding the inscription ~iXraTro9 o alcdptow 7rcara9 6 ?oeol c1t0Xo9, and the letters M X, for ~pvrl Xadptv. Each of the side-pediments has a round boss in the centre; and a garland hangs from the supporting pillars, and beneath it is the representation of a fish. All the ornament is in relief, with 1 In a paper on Isauraii inscriptions and topography intended to be published by Prof. arnmsay along with this paper, but postponed through want of space.</page><page sequence="6">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. 265 I AAAE KOCMHCENTON M A K A P IoNTTAT AN TO \Y KVTA TCNTR A~TYUNVN AU H KAPIOCTTATTAC ei '4V4o ~ L~; I~ lar"J ~6 ~ 6~ ~J ~t: FIG. 2a.

The fins of the left fish were not visible on the stone, and have been restored from comparison with the other. The larger part of the epitaph is inscribed above the ornament, close to the upper edge of the stone. Several other examples of this simple style of monument, found in Lycaonia and Pisidia, will be published in the course of this paper, and seem to prove that it is of purely local origin. The tomb is evidently that of a bishop. In the expression 6 ,aKtdptov 7radra?, 7radraw must be either the name or the title of the person buried there, probably the latter. Judging from the general character of Anatolian inscriptions, Prof. Ramsay came to the conclusion, in view of the stone in 1901, that it was not later than the second half of' the third century, and that 7riaraw was the title. This opinion was afterwards confirmed by the fact that in one of the Amherst papyri o 'aK/cpto9 ?'d 'ra is obviously used as a title of the Bishop of Alexandria as early as A.D. 270-80. But this epitaph shows the remarkable peculiarity that the title supplants the actual name in imitation of the pagan custom, according to which a priest who became lepaJvv/.ol (like the principal priests at Eleusis and in various of the great Anatolian cities) dropped his own name and was known simply by his title. This peculiarity is suggestive of a very early date ; and that the stone is an early one, prior to the time of Constantine, is shown also by the lettering and by the general character of the epitaph and the ornament. The wording of the epitaph, 'b'v yXv6lrTaTov Kat 7ra,ToPV ov, is of an early Christian period, being full of human feeling, whereas the epithets applied to such persons as bishops afterwards became much more religious and stereotyped in character. Compare the tender expression XviKLrJEpoV cOCOT' Ica' -0 o applied by Aur. Xanthias to his son who died at the age of seven, in a Christian inscription of Rome, dated by the consuls of A.D. 238. The phrase n-avrwv IfkXo0 is here used in an inscription which is undoubtedly Christian, and such moral sentiments are found on many Christian tombstones, but (as Prof. Ramsay remarks in Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, ii. p. 495) they cannot alone 'be taken as a proof of Christian origin. In some cases similar sentiments were inscribed on non-Christian tombs as a counterblast to Christianity. Thus at Temenothyrai, C.I.G. 3865 MdpKov lloXt'rov ctX0ood-ov 7-dtVTroV JiXov clearly belongs to the pagan philosophical reaction' (on which compare Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, ii. p. 506 f., and an article in Expositor, Oct. 1904). 'It seems that they were originally Christian, and their occurrence on pagan stones is a proof of the strong influence which the new religion exerted even on its opponents. Another example is found in Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, ii. p. 386 f. No. 232.

The inscription continues in the ordinary style of epitaphs, though with some unusual features (published with some difference by Messrs. Heberdey and</page><page sequence="8">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA .NOVA. 267 Wilhelm in Wiener Akad. Denkschriften, 1896, p. 5). It is evidently either Christian or of the reaction, when the aim was to show that paganism was superior to Christianity on its own lines. At Salonika 7t 7rdav7rv AiXp MvXaiy is probably pagan (Mitth. Inst. Athen, 1896, p. 98). Oeo ikXos is probably a play on Theophilus, the real name of the bishop. The fish, the common symbol of the Christians in the early centuries, passed out of use at a comparatively early date, and the same is true of the open book which appears on this stone and which may represent the Bible. This symbol occurs also on several North-Phrygian tombs, which Prof. Ramsay published in the Expositor in 1888, arguing that they were Christian on account of the formula Trv 0ebOv o-b /'Lj a KrcreS,2 which occurs in some of them and that the tablets must be understood to indicate the Bible. The present inscription may be regarded as complete confirmation of this argument, or at least -of the first part of it: this class of gravestone is Christian. The character of the ornament on this stone also points to an early date, probably the third century A.D. It seems at first sight to be an earlier stage of the elaborate decoration common on Byzantine and Roman sarcophagi of the fourth century, a row of figures standing in niches, with highly intricate and elaborate tracery and architectural ornament. Here we have the semi- architectural schema, without the human figures. But, as one stone after another is discovered, we see that the schema is a traditional type in Nova Isaura, characteristic of the place, which is likely to have lasted for centuries, varied, but never essentially changed. The fact that it is a simpler stage of the fourth century sarcophagus style would not, taken alone, prove anything about date. But this monument is very much larger than the other Dorla monuments, and represents an attempt to improve upon and elaborate the native type. New elements are introduced on this stone which are unknown on any of the other stones in Dorla; and yet it is indubitably among the very earliest of all the examples found in the village. This more ambitious style is a proof that more money, care, and work were spent on this stone. It was the tomb of an exceptional person (either through his wealth or through his rank) and it represented the highest stage of which local art was capable, elaborating the native schema by imported additions, especially the fish, that wide-spread symbol, which was certainly not invented in Nova Isaura, but intro- duced there from outside. Now, had this large and ambitious monument been built in the fourth century, it would probably have shown some of the Graeco- Roman forms most characteristic of that time; taking into consideration the entire absence of those characteristic fourth century forms, and the fact that in the Dorla series this has all the appearance of being among the earliest,3 we must infer that it belongs to the third century. The ornament scattered liberally over the surface of the stone contains various elements; but none of these are necessarily borrowed from a formed 2 The formula is always misspelt; but the above seems to have been the intention. 3 Only No. 59 seems to be distinctly earlier, but it belongs to an older type, the ordinary pagan heroiin.</page><page sequence="9">268 A. M. RAMSAY Graeco-Roman art The fish was taken as a symbol, not as an artistic element, and is placed on the tomb to be significant, and not merely to be ornamental. We have in this stone a simple development of the native art, and not a mixture of an indigenous and an exotic art. Other elements in the ornamentation, besides the fish, are almost certainly symbolical. The vine branch above the central pediment indicates that the bishop was a branch of the true vine, the open book, as has been stated, represents the Bible, and the garland symbolises the crown of life. It is probable that the six-leaved rosettes are also symbolical. The frequency of this rosette on Lycaonian Christian monuments, and the way in which it is employed in one which I hope to publish in a subsequent article, suggest that it is a modification of the early Christian monogram ,, originally representing 'I(yootv) X(piO-r6 ). The book should be compared with the mosaic inscription of Naro in Africa (Hammam-Lif), instrumnenta servi tui on an open diploma. This inscription was in mosaic in a room beside the church, containing the sacred books, etc. Rev. Arch. 1904, p. 368 (Instrumenta =' Scriptures,' Tertull. Apol. 19, 21, 47; instrumnenta litteraturae, id. ib. 18.) The title 7rdvra9 employed in this inscription is extremely interesting. It proves what was before probable, that this title was at first employed much more widely and was gradually restricted in use. Heraeus, Archiv f. latein. Lexicogr. xiii. p. 157, says that the use of Papa to indicate the Bishop in Roman inscriptions begins about A.D. 300 (quoting from de Rossi, Inscr. Christ. Urbis Rom. i. p. cxv = Anth. Lat. epigr. 656, 2) and that from the sixth century it is confined to the Pope (quoting from Caesar, de aet. tit. Christ. p. 65), Prof. Harnack in Berl. Sitzungsber. 1900, p. 990, points out that in the West Papa was, in early times, used only in Rome, but was there employed as the ordinary term for bishop, either of Rome or of any other place. Tertullian uses it sarcastically of the Roman bishop Callistus. In the East Harnack thinks it was used only in Egypt, and only of the bishop of Alexandria, so that U ,aladpLoq rrdwral was the recognised title of that bishop alone, while other Egyptian bishops were styled -,arT;p Ckv. In the pre- Nicene period, as he says, the title rrdiral is not known to have been used of any other Eastern bishop: but it was customary for the Alexandrian bishops from at least as early as 250. Only in the letter of Pseudo-Justin to Zenas and Serenus the title b vrdwral occurs. This Isauran inscription shows that Prof. Harnack's distinction is too rigid, and that the phrase was used in Asia Minor during the third century. Dr. Sanday also quotes Gregory Thaum. ,Vp.

Though a bishop is mentioned in this epitaph, the name Isaura never occurs in the Byzantine lists of bishoprics. Prof. Ramsay has shown in an article on Lycaonia, which is already printed and will be published in the Austrian Jahreshefte, 1904, Part II., that the two neighbouring towns, Isaura Nova and Korna, were bishoprics in early time, but were merged in the great autokephalos bishopric of Isaura Palaea, called Leontopolis, some time after 381, and probably at the same time that the name Leontopolis was given to</page><page sequence="10">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. 269 Isaura, about 474.4 Basil himself, Ep. 190, dreaded this loss of independence for the Put"po7roXtrelato 'o7T "tptpoKCpLat9 ratl dex 'n aXatoD -e7rto-7d-wv tOp6vov eXovratv, and in order to prevent it when the bishopric of Isaura Palaea was vacant about 374, he wrote to Amphilochius of Iconium and recommended the nomination of officials called Vrpot'ordTtpevot for the smaller towns or cities before a new bishop was appointed for Isaura. Prof. Ramsay in 1901 discovered the grave of one of these officials at Alkaran, between Korna and Nea Isaura, with the inscription pv' pr Xidpt KdvvoJhO [Trpo]trTa[p6vov]: see No. 45. The name crdiral, applied to the priest of Malos Galatiae in Acta S. Theodoti, is quoted by a writer in Anal. Boll. xxii. p. 327 as a proof that the document was not written by a contemporary, but belongs to a later age. In view of our inscription this argument falls to the ground, and the use of the term 7rdrras in that document is rather favourable to the view (advocated by Prof. Ramsay many years ago, and recently by Prof. Harnack and others) that the Acta S.

It is doubtful whether certain marks to the left of 1. 1 indicate a letter. This stone also shows the scheme characteristic of the district, the rounded pedi- ment flanked by two pointed ones, all supported by four columns. The more conventional form of wreath which here appears is very common on tomb- stones in this district, as are the two implements below it. The one on the right is evidently a hammer, while the other apparently represents some sort of knife or sickle: it appears in complete form in No. 22. Under the right- hand pediment is a complicated ornament represented in the epigraphical copy by cross lines. A more correct representation of a small part is given below. (Fig. 3b). Each lozenge is indented with sides sloping to a deep point in the centre, and each is separated by a ridge, viz., the general level of the surface from the surrounding lozenges. This is probably intended to represent a fisherman's net; and, if so, the ornament is significant and not purely decora- tive. It is extremely unfortunate that the corresponding symbol or ornament under the left pediment has been completely defaced, probably because its character offended Mohammedan taste. With regard to the date of this inscription I quote the following from Prof. Ramsay :-' If this inscription were late, it might be argued that " IIao-1itXov" has perhaps here become a single epithet, and is no longer felt to be a pair of words, as it is in many second and third century inscriptions. But on the other hand this epithet does not belong to the later stereotyped Byzantine phraseology; and nothing in the inscription 'That date may be taken as the final legal confirmation of the subjection which had long been aimed at by the bishops of Palaea Isaura (as is clear from Basil loc. cit.); the bishops of those two places came to an end after 451, when they sent bishops to Chalcedon, but before 474.'-W.M.R.</page><page sequence="11">270 A. MNT. RAMSAY suggests the ecclesiastical system as it can be seen almost fully formed in the writings of the three great Cappadocians, Basil and the Gregories. The first half of the fourth century seems to be the latest allowable date for this inscription. It might possibly be assigned to the third.' The crosses placed so inconspicuously as part of the ornamentation here should be noted. The earliest position of the cross on gravestones was pro- bably above the 'inscription. In this situation it might pass for a sort of ornament, and thus it would not draw attention too prominently, while it would be significant to those who could understand. As has been pointed out by Prof. Ramsay, Cities and Bish. of Phrygia, ii. p. 502, that is the char- S -MAAKEPOCKAIOA AIAN L AIC H AEAH CKOC MHCAN TON ITAC C i (/f\ ONC iT (CKO TFON F A . 3a.

An inscription (probably of the third century) found a few miles west of Laodiceia Katakekaumene in Galatic Phrygia, and published by Mr. Hogarth, J.H.S. 1890, p. 165, No. 23, belongs to this class; the editor has omitted the cross above the inscription (which w as recopied by Prof. Ramsay in 1891). Later than this are (1) the class of inscriptions in which the developed symbol f or P is placed above the epitaph, as for example Ath. Mitth. xiii. 1887, 256, No. 70; (2) the class in which the simple + is placed before the first word (and often after the last word) of the inscription, and in the same line with it.

The six-leaved rosette which appears here is a very common ornament in various slightly modified forms on tombstones in Lycaonia.

The symbol of the swastika Ft occurs frequently on stones both on the frontiers of Pisidia and on the borders of Lycaonia and Isauria. Prof. Sterrett (Wolfe Expedition, No. 220, cp. also Nos. 56, 93) mentions a stele with ,,Cj ToN A1AKONON T A BCI N N ANN A H MH T HP KA I OYA ArtCIKA " C J' TON h Al KoON, TA BINNANNA H~ )JHTH P K A AoVKAoco A ",-" TOYeo ( OCFk H , 7 - j , CAN 4.

This tomb of the deacon is distinctly later than that of Bishop Theo- philus (No. 2). The ornament and arrangement are closely analogous to the tomb of Bishop Mammas, but later, as the phrase -v TetptcoraTov dtcovov has already the technical character of the Byzantine church formulas. But the general form of the inscription is still of the older type, and it can hardly be much later than the middle of the fourth century, and may even be as early as the time of Constantine; on the whole a date about the epoch of Basil, A.D. 353-370, is most probable. It is quite probable that the tombs of Bishop Mammas and Deacon Tabeis were made in the same work- shop, and are separated by only a very few years from one another. The</page><page sequence="13">272 A. M. RAMSAY tomb of Rufus, No. 16, comes from the same workshop, and must there- fore be placed in the same period. 5 (Fig. 5).-Dorla. R. 1904.

The proportions of the ornament on this tombstone are almost identical with those of No. 21; but in the one case the inscription is placed in the [ Ot\r NOTA To c CKOUChHIENo Cf CAkO AC TTI CKOFioC ! .(, . C ..c-' L FIG. 5. space above, in the other it is written across the ornament. The columns are a little more Greek and exotic in shape in No. 5 than in No. 21. But the two evidently come from the same workshop and belong to the same period. They were standing ready-made in the shop, and bought before the inscriptions were placed on them, according to the custom observable in many other cases, whereas No. 2 was perhaps made by special order to suit Bishop Theophilus. It is difficult to decide whether this pair or the three, Nos. 3, 4, and 16, should be placed earlier. The language of No. 5 is more artificial and elaborate than that of No. 3, but on the other hand it differs from the formulae which were already accepted and stereotyped about 360, and must represent an older local growth of terminology which was afterwards abolished by the general custom of the Church (seen in No. 4). It might very well be that Sisamoas succeeded Mammas, and the Deacon was a younger contemporary of Sisamoas, while the two sets of stones came from two rival workshops. 8ve'rnq is an old epic and poetic word, applied to Nestor in Homer, also to Muses, Apollo, a lyre, etc. It is characteristic of the Greek used in the rural districts of the plateau to employ old poetic words, as Prof. Ramsay has pointed out in the case of Tdeuop and others. "8svesrqv seems to have become a standing epithet of bishops in Nova Isaura: cp. No. 39 in the inscrip- tions of Nova Isaura, which will be published by Prof. Ramsay in the Papers of the American School of Rome. 6.-In the wall of a house at Alkaran, one hour N. of Dorla.

Below this is a garland which, like those hanging beneath the side pediments, is of a, more conventional and less natural type than those on the Bishop's tomb (No. 2). The name Indakos is a fuller form of Inzas, the name of a bishop of Korna (12 miles N. W.) in A.D. 381. On the common variation between forms in A and Z compare Histor. Geogr. of Asia lH. pp. 285, 348, adding Arianzos of Cappadocia and Ariandos in an unpublished inscription of the Lydian district Katakekaumnene. 7.--A broken fragment in the wall of a house at Dorla: the inscription is lost.

RAMSAY and to the right is part of a rounded arch within which is the shell also seen in No. 6. One of the two columns supporting the pediment is twisted, and between them is a male figure wearing a cap and a flowing mantle. This monument, when complete, probably showed a female figure under the right side pediment, similar to the Pisidian inscription found at Kyr Stefan near Colonia Parlais by Prof. Ramsay in 1886, which is here added for comparison (Fig. 7b). The text is published by Mr. Cronin, J.IH.S. 1902, p. 114. The details were not drawn by Prof. Ramsay, who only sketched the general outline: they are added here from his verbal notes. The Isauran schema is here elaborated by the addition of something of the Greek anthropomorphic tendency. In accordance with what has been said on No. 1, this addition must be attributed to the influence of Greek education and knowledge, coming through the great cities like Iconium. The native architectural schema is here still the ruling element, and the exotic idea is subsidiary, filling up empty spaces, but the pillars are in shape Graeco-Roman rather than of the old native fashion. 8.-One side of the sarcophagus of Sidamaria, in Lycaonia, now in the Imperial Museum, Stamboul. When we come to this sarcophagus, found in the same district, and so nearly resembling in scheme of ornament the stones just given, we can scarcely doubt that it is a later development of the same principle; the native schema has been embellished and added to through contact with Greek artistic ideas. -Here we have still several columns supporting rounded pediments or arches, a series of figures in the niches between the pillars, and within each arch an elaborate variant of the shell which has already appeared in a simple form on Nos. 6 and 7. The lower portion of the scheme is partially suppressed to make room for the figur, s, and both the capitals of the columns and the pediments are decorated with highly elaborate open-work tracery. The columns themselves are twisted, a style already appearing in No. 7 (also No. 21). But the Greek sculpture has now become the ruling element, and the native schema only appears in the background. The two elements are, however, just as inconsistent with one another here as they are in No. 1: a hunting scene of the Greek fashion is placed amid the columns and arches of the South Anatolian schema, and wherever the latter interferes too much with the Greek figures it is suppressed. On two other sides of the same sarcophagus pointed central pediments appear flanked by rounded arches. This style must be attributed to an Anatolian city where Greek work was well known; but there is probably too much of the Greek element for a central Anatolian city, like Nova Isaura or even Iconium, and the scale of the monument is too great for the humbler workshops of those cities. In Revue des htudes Anciennes, 1901, p. 358, Prof. Ramsay pointed out that two great examples of this developed art had been found, one in the Lycaonian city Sidamaria, and the other in the maritime Isaurian city Seleucia, and that the sculptural ornament on both was so similar as to prove their origin from a single workshop, and hence he inferred that the point of common origin must have been the great city of</page><page sequence="16">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. 275 Tarsus, where alone an atelier capable of producing such works is likely to have existed. Thence one example was carried over the great Roman road through the Cilician Gates into Lycaonia, and the other, by sea to Seleucia. FIG. 8. This hypothesis suits all the known conditions. Tarsus attracted the aspiring youth of Lycaonia and Cappadocia (see article 'Tarsus' in Hastings' Dict. of the Bible, iv. p. 685), and was itself influenced by them while it influenced .their development. 9.-At Alkaran. 1904.

Is it pagan, one of the Dioscuri with the star over his head, or is the star a rude cross as in No. 10 ? The formula o'JeiS ccOdvaProq occurs often in Christian inscriptions, but also in pagan epitaphs.

Sic. 114 (from the Syracusan catacombs), which ends with the acclamatio eipo;pet. As the horseman is imitated from the customary representation of the Dioscuri, it appears that in this case the Christians took over a pagan type and used it to express their own ideas. The type is similar to No. 12 found at Dorla, but not exactly the same. Hence it is given here though it perhaps lies outside the territory of Nova Isaura. 12.-Dorla. R. 1890 and 1904.

Praenomina began to pass out of use in the third century after A.D. 212. They were important before that time as proving Roman citizenship; but when all free citizens of the provinces had become Roman, the value of the praenomen disappeared and it was gradually disused. The Latin character of the names also favours a comparatively early date. On the other hand it is probable that the name Valerius was introduced into Isaura Nova in the time of Diocletian. Aur. Valerius was probably born about 290-300; and the stone may be dated about 330-350, when all the circumstances of name and style are taken into account.

As the grave was a recently made one, he enquired to what family it belonged, and was able eventually to trace it back to a village called Tchumra, about half-way between Dorla and Konia. Further he could not trace it, and it remains uncertain whether the stone was brought to Tchumra recently or not : but there can be no doubt that his first impression was correct, and that it was cut by the same workman as Nos. 5 and 21. The ornament in the central space between the columns is evidently a representation of two birds. Those in the side spaces are unfortunately so much defaced that it is impossible to say what they are, though the general outline is pretty certain. This is the only one of the three which has been drawn to scale. It</page><page sequence="30">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. 289 was impossible for various reasons to make measured drawings of the others; and for them the ultimate authority lies in sketches made by my father according to simple eyesight. But he recognised the same heavy proportions in this as in the other two, which he knew the better from having drawn them, and from having already observed the difference in their proportions friom the other monuments of Dorla. The last Fig. (39) shows a piece of embroidery which Mrs. Ramsay purchased in Dorla, where it had been handed down for many generations in a family resident there. FIG. 39. The pattern is a variation of the design characteristic of Isaura Nova, adapted to suit the different material, and repeated as often as the width of the cloth permits. There are three pointed pediments, that in the middle one considerably larger than the other two, and all having a boss above the point. The pillars supporting the central pediment have been transformed into palm trees, which rise above the spring of the arch and incline over the side pediments. The side columns have disappeared to make room for a fanciful ornament of little cypress trees and large round flowers, apparently roses. Beneath each of the side pediments is a design in squares, seemingly a modification of the net which appears on two of the monuments (Nos. 3 and 4), perhaps suggested by the latticed balcony common in the country.</page><page sequence="31">290 A. M. RAMSAY Immediately under the central pediment is a repetition on a smaller scale of the Isauran design, this time with pointed side pieces, of a form similar to that which appears in No. 26, flanking a low round arch: below this again are a flower of some sort and a long garland hanging from the columns, or trees, very much like the garlands on the tomb of Bishop Theophilus, except that it is fastened to each pillar in two places, instead of merely by the ends. On' the complicated and difcult question of the period to which the whole set of monuments just given belong, and on.which I have not the experience necessary to speak, I may quote the following series of arguments : 'The period at which these monuments were made is determined by several lines of argument. (1) Many of them afford individually some indication of date. These indications (stated already in the descriptions of each separately) point to the period 250-400 A.D. (2) The names indicate unmistakably an early period. The stones are for the most part Christian, yet distinctively Christian names are extremely rare. Only Doxa once, Petros twice in No. 26, and Paulos once, are found. It is pointed out in the Cities and Bishoprics of Phr. ii. p. 492, that personal names of obviously Christian type begin to appear in inscriptions not earlier than the middle of the third century. As might be expected, Paulos is the earliest and commonest; but it is of course often impossible to say whether the name was due to Christian reasons, or. arose, from pagan causes. It is impossible that a Christian city with bishops, deacons, presbyters, prolstamenoi, oikonomoi, homologetai, should be so devoid of Christian personal names, as is Nova Isaura, later than the third or fourth centuries. The lists of bishops even in the fourth century show a decided preponderance of a class of names distinctively Christian and Greek. To judge from the names alone, one would be inclined to assert that the mass of the inscriptions, especially the sculptured stones, are distinctly older than A.D. 400. The rarity of Greek names is also remarkable.. Apart firom the hybrid forms, Poplas (Publius) and Hortisis (the Greek spelling of Hortensius), the only Greek names are Simonides, Nestor, Kleonikos, and Demetrios. Demetrios may be due to Christian causes, or it may have established itself as one of the commonest Greek names. Simonides and Nestor probably came through study of Greek literature.s Roman names are far more numerous. Some are due to imperial causes: the names of reigning families established themselves widely in the provinces. Julius occurs only once in one of the earliest of all the inscrip- tions. This proves that the inscriptions are not so old as A.D. 150; before 150 Julius would be commoner. P. Aelius Julius is a name characteristic of On this influence see J.H.S. 1883, p. 36.</page><page sequence="32">THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. 291 the period following Hadrian. Faustina, Domna, and Zenobios came into use in succession at later dates. The praenomen Aur. came in after 212 A.D., and can rarely be fouhd later than 350, and is most characteristic of the period 212-300. Valerius was probably introduced under Diocletian about 300 A.D. Specially important is the absence of names taken from the dynasty of Constantine. The name Flavius never occurs on the sculptured monuments, but is found once in No. 52. Some proportion of persons who died between 350 and 450 would certainly bear the name Flavius: hence we must conclude that these stones are as a rule earlier than 350. The other Roman names are either the commonest, Gaius, Lucius, Marcus, Maxima-all partially due, it may be, to Christian influence (as must be remembered)-or are of uncertain reason, as Caecilius, Aulus, Hor- tensius, Rufus, Valgius (some at least due to imitation of the names of Roman officials). Makeros may be Macer, and -illa is uncertain, but the termination is Latin. But the overwhelming wrass of names are pure Anatolian. On the sculptured stones occur the following: Andis?, Andas, Ammas, Appas, Banalis, Balaththis, Detrios, Indakos, [Ka ?]ddis, Konon (may be due to Christian influence, but the name is characteristic of Isauria and Pamphylia), Kottonis, Lourmas, Mammas, Mammeis, M^s, Nanna, Nannasos, Oas, Okluos?, Ouan6lis, Ouatialis, Papas, Papias, Sisamoas, Soas, Tabeis, Tas, Thouthou, Zouzou. This great preponderance of native, non-Greek, as well as non-Biblical, names proves beyond doubt that the monuments belong as a whole to the period 250-400, though some isolated examples may be later. It will be noticed that the bishops, deacons, and other ecclesiastical officials are, as thoroughly Anatolian in name as the rest of the people. (3) The tombs of three bishops (perhaps four) give a standard: there were no bishops in Nova Isaura after about 474, as is shown on No. 2. (4) With few exceptions the lettering is remarkably uniform in style, and little development occurs in the forms of the letters. A style was evidently formed at a certain date, and persisted almost unchanged in a school of local artisans; but such persistence could not last very long, as external causes would have forced a change. The pressure of those causes almost entirely destroyed the art, instead of merely modifying it. As to the period when that style was formed, the argument is of another kind. (5) The earliest monument cannot be earlier than the latter part of the second century, No. 33. The majority are unmistakably third or fourth century works, and the remainder must be estimated on the same standard. Moreover, the great majority are certainly Christian. Not merely the cross, as on Nos. 3, 4, 10, 16, 29, but also the common swastika and the candlestick (Nos. 30, 31) must be regarded as Christian symbols on these monuments. Thus fifteen of the most important and characteristic monuments are marked as Christian, 2-5, 10, 16 f., 23, 24 ff., 29 ff., 34. The rosette of six arms occurs on most of the graves that are certainly Christian, and may be reckoned as a H.S. VOL. XXIV. X</page><page sequence="33">292 THE EARLY CHRISTIAN ART OF ISAURA NOVA. Christian ornament also; while the more elaborate symbol on Nos. 14, 28, 3S, may be regarded as a combination of rosette and cross. We are, in short, here in the presence of a distinctly Christian art. It is not meant that every artisan in Nova Isaura who worked on these monu- ments, or every person who used them, was a Christian; but that the development arose during the inspiration and "quickening of mind and activity caused by the general acceptance of the new religion in the city. It is no isolated phenomenon, but the invariable experience of history, that the spread of a new faith is accompanied by an invigoration of the spirit and character of the people : witness the Arabs of the seventh and eighth centuries under the inspiration of Mohammedanism. Where the religion is spread by external causes or by force, it does not so touch the spirit. In this sense the art of Nova Isaura is a Christian art, and its first development cannot be placed earlier than the third century. It used, of course, older forms, already existing in pagan use; but it used them with freedom and novelty for its own purposes. (6) One consideration would tell in favour of an earlier date than has been yet assigned. There is an entire absence of the Christian symbolism characteristic of the fourth century. Neither f, nor the later P, nor A W, though all are found in the neighbouring towns of Lycaonia, occur on any of the sculptured stones of obviously Christian origin at Dorla. The Christian symbolism is of that veiled and half cryptic kind which we have been disposed to regard as characteristic of the pre-Constantinian period; and it would not be surprising if general opinion should ultimately place the whole set of these sculptured stones of Nova Isaura between A.D. 250 and 340. At present we may safely place them all between 250 and 400. Mr. Cronin has published a good example of a complete series of inscrip- tions of a village of Lycaonia in J.H.S. 1902, pp. 358-367. They may be placed roughly between 350 and 600; but not one of them could be considered earlier than even the latest stone at Nova Isaura, so far as is yet known.' In conclusion it should be stated that the most important of the drawings here given were made to scale on the spot. But for some (chiefly 5, 7b, 15, 21) I have followed the hasty sketches made by Prof. Ramsay, either because we failed to find the stones in 1904, or because they were in a position inaccessible to me. The simpler monuments, Nos. 26-37, do not need to be drawn to scale: these are all indicated on the stones simply by incised lines, without any relief. The inscriptions are given from Prof. Ramsay's copies, the date of which is given in every case. A. MARGARET RAMSAY.</page></plain_text>
