SOKOLOFF The exercise of imagination required to portray a child's inner life has figured prominently in twentieth-century Jewish fiction. Naomi Sokoloff draws on contemporary narrative theory?especially the work of M. M. Bakhtin?to establish a critical framework for reading a range of Hebrew, Yiddish, and English texts that focus on young protagonists and the workings of a child's imagination. She discusses works by Sholem Aleichem, H. N. Bialik, Henry Roth, Jerzy Kosinski, Ahron Appelfeld, and David Grossman. $29.95 hardcover Winner of the Maurice Amado Foundation Award in Sephardic Studies, 1992 National Jewish Book Awards THE COMPUNCTIOUS POET Cultural Ambiguity and Hebrew Poetry in Muslim Spain ROSS BRANN The courtier-rabbis of Muslim Spain were torn by conflicting desires to write secular poetry yet conform to a traditional Jewish culture that seemingly forbade it. They would come to embrace Arabic style to the point of composing, in Hebrew, lyrical love poetry and wine songs. The Compunctious Poet is the first book in English to examine one of medieval Hebrew poetry's major themes? the unease of poets writing secular verse at odds with what they held sacred. $36.50 hardcover THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS 701 West 40th Street, Suite 275, Baltimore, Maryland 21211 To order, call 1-800-537-5487.</page><page sequence="8">Publishing Research Quarterly Pi Hi.ismsc, ResearchQi ' Beth Luey, editor Arizona State University Significant research and analysis on or about the full range of the publishing en vironment, the distribution and marketing of books and journals, and the social, political, economic and technological con ditions that shape the publishing process from editorial decision making to order processing.

CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE Hasdai Crescas Translated with an Introduction and Notes by Daniel J. Lasker During the fourteenth century, there was a general demoralization in the Jewish community in Spain. Many Jews were oil the brink of conversion. Rabbi Crescas met the Christian challenge by writing this pithy book refuting the principles of the Christian religion. He argued that the basic Christian doctrines, namely, original sin, salvation, trinity, baptism, the messiah, a new covenant, and demons, contradict human reason, thereby calling into question Christianity's claim to be a true religion. The Refutation is an important document of the medieval Jewish-Christian debate and is also especially important for the history of Jewish philosophy in general. i 50 pages ? $i2.95 pb. ? isbn 0-79?4-0966-X incarnation, virgin birth, transubstantiation, State University of New York Press do CUP Services ?
