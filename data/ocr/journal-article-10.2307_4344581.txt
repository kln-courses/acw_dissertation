Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1960. Pp. xiv, 468. $7.50. PROFESSOR SOLMSEN describes this book as "a study in continuity and transformation" (p. vii). It shows that "the scientific endeavors of the Presocratics have a sequel", that the problems and results of their work, as well as of Plato's, help to form the basis for Aris- totle's cosmological and physical studies. He shows, for example, how the concept of genesis, which had been denied by Parmenides and not used by the later pre- Socratics, was restored by Plato, accepted by Aristotle, and developed in ways that show the influence of several of his predecessors. The influence of Plato is predominant, but in his renewed attention to the de- tails of cosmology and physics, and in his vindicationi of the legitimacy of such studies, Aristotle is carrying on the older tradition. A historical introduction sets forth the pertinent "Presocratic legacies" and some physical topics in Plato's later philosophy. Tlle remainder of the book takes up, successively, the doctrines of the Physics, On the Heaven, On Coming to Be and Passing Away, and the Meteorologica. Much attention is devoted, of course, to leading ideas like genesis and movement, but in various contexts. They are not followed up individ- ually because each treatise, with its peculiar purposes and perspectives, is studied as a unit. An important emphasis is laid on the many-sidedness of Aristotle's PELICAN BOOKS of Classical Interest ANCIENT EDUCATION AND TODAY By E. B. CASTLE What use are the ideas of ancient Greece, Rome, and Palestine in the edui- cation of our children today? Can these ideas be relevant in a technological age? Professor Castle has written this book because he thinks that, in the current and necessary enthusiasm for technolo- gical instruction, many people have lost sight of the fact that education is not just a gadget for the making of other gadgets, but the proper rearing of our children so that they become good men.

"Between the different phases of his work there prevails an attitude of mutual, though by no means uncritical, respect" (p. 443). Thus Solm- sen sees differences less as "inconsistencies" than as stages in a process or aspects of a varied pattern. Into a potentially dry exposition Professor Solim- sen succeeds in infusing life, often by anthropomorphic metaphors ("The Physics shows no desire to interfere with the Metaphysics or to influence its scrutinies"). The pleasant, sometimes even humorous style reflects the author's genial personality. DEPAIJW` IJNIVERSITY EDWIN L. MINAR, JR.</page></plain_text>
