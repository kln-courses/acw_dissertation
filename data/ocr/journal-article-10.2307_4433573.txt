LIDOV Abstract In current commentaries and translations, the first stanza of Sappho fr. 17 is read as a prayer for Hera's presence. This understanding was cre- ated by modifying Wilamowitz's interpretation of the fragment as a dream narrative, but it depends on an improbable use of the opening word p??- s???, involves an awkward third-person periphrasis for the second-person appeal, and creates insoluble difficulties of supplementation and usage in the third line. It is more fruitful to read the stanza as a deprecation of the god's anger, as in fr. 1.1-4; a suggested reading of ?a??p?? ??e??a? (cf. 77. 21.335) gives ???ta? a meaning within its normal, somewhat pejo- rative connotation, and allows a more plausible reconstruction of the end of line 3; attributing the source of the Atridae's distress to Hera is con- sistent with a number of indications of a narrative pattern in which Hera sends disruptive storms. Although neither Voigt nor Lobel-Page prints any supplements for the first two lines of Sappho fr. 17, contemporary discussions of the poem are unanimous in understanding the first stanza to be an invocation of the god's presence, making the stanza an instance of a cletic prayer. The supplements printed by Page in his commentary illustrate what I will call the common reading: p?as??? d? ?' [e??????a? fa?e??, p?t??' 9??a, sa ?[a??essa ???fa, ta? ???ta? ?t[???da? ^ - ???- t?? ?as???e?- 'Close to me [while I pray, be your gracious form revealed], O lady Hera, to whom the Atridae, [illustrious] kings, made prayer(?):") 1) 1959: 58-9.

LIDOV The second stanza and the first two lines of the third describe the difficulties that the Atridae encountered on the way home and the prayer that ensured them safe passage. Line 10 returns to the pre- sent time of the singer (??? de), when, presumably, the god's aid or presence is again desired; very little of the final two stanzas remains. In his comments Page includes the supplements in line 2 and ?t???da? in 3 among those that "have a higher degree of likeli- hood than usual" (59). The proper noun does indeed seem to be required by the evi- dence (and is printed in V. and L-P), but the first-person pronoun of the first line, the supplements of the second line and the form and interpretation of the third line, as they are commonly under- stood, do not have their origin in the readable remains or in any external evidence; they are conjectures which Wilamowitz offered to illustrate an entirely different interpretation of the poem's open- ing and purpose. The resulting intermixture of two interpretations creates a number of new difficulties and leaves some problems unsolved. Most notably, the use of p??s??? in the new context is almost certainly impossible; but even if one argues that none of the individual difficulties is fatal by itself, the accumulation makes the common reading highly improbable. I will detail the problems below, and make clear why I think the evidence better supports a very different reconstruction, one in which the first stanza, as in Poem 1, the Hymn to Aphrodite, begins the poem with a negative request that describes the distress in which the speaker finds herself (either personally or on behalf of her community). 1. From Dream to Prayer When the two overlapping papyri that comprise Sappho 17 were first published {PSI 123.3-12 and P.Oxy. 1231 1 II.2-21), Wilamowitz (1914: 228) reconstructed the fragment as Sappho's recounting of the foundation myth (centered on the Atridae's difficulties and prayer) of the Lesbian cult of Hera, Zeus and Dionysus (all mentioned in New York PSC-CUNY Research Program. I am grateful to Jacob Stern, David Sider, Andr? Lardinois and Ludwig Koenen for their suggestions and criticisms, but remain responsible for the enduring flaws.</page><page sequence="3">HERA IN SAPPHO, FR. 17 L-P,V?AND AENEID I? 389 the third stanza), sung to accompany the public performance of its rites (which appear to be described in the fourth stanza, a??? . . . / [p]a??[????. . .).2) For the first two lines he supplied Sappho's rec- ollection of a private dream in which the form of Hera had appeared to her: ?[?? p?t* d?a? pa??sta. ... sa ?a??essa ???fa. The relative clause in line 3 identified Hera's appearance with the one which the Atridae had worshipped, so that Sappho's dream motivated the narration. He read ?d?? p??-t?? in lines 3-4 to emphasize the aition and supplied ??? in line 5 to introduce the narration. Fr?nkel objected that it was abnormal for a dream to be recalled without more content, that such a private experience hardly belonged to a public function, and that p??s??? d? should anticipate a wish (1968: 62 n. 1). Editors met the objection by substituting Milne's supplement e??????a? fa?e?? (or pa?e??) in line 1, and a new adjec- tive in line 3/4, thereby eliminating the dream and making the poem a form of entreaty.3) Small additions published by Lobel in 1951 (P.Oxy XXI 4, 122) excluded ??? in line 5 and showed that the poem's final line could be read pHJp' ?p??e[s?a?. These made it more likely that the poem was a request for the god to appear in aid, and that, as in Poem 1, the myth functioned as the sanctio (or hypomnesis), a recitation of a prior history of the god or peti- tioner that assures the renewed performance of divine aid. The version that results from this series of emendations of Wila- mowitz's interpretation leaves the opening as a very generalized request for divine aid. Its ambiguity has led to debate over how to characterize it more precisely; in particular, over how to specify its connection to the myth?whether the point of the myth was the analogy to the Atridae's difficulties at sea, the success of their prayer, or (with Wilamowitz) the address of the prayer to the Lesbian trin- ity. Since we cannot know even the outline of the last two stan- zas?the final infinitive could request either the god's arrival to the singer (and her group) or the safe arrival somewhere of the singer 2) This is a slight revision of the text he supplied for the publication of PSI 123. He was influenced by AP 9.189 (= Sa. test. 51 Campbell, 55 Gallovotti). See also Wilamowitz-Moellendorf 1913: 42 n. 1. 3) For the history of the interpretation and emendation of fr. 17, see Theander 146-7 and Saake zKS 120-1, as well as Voigt's apparatus.</page><page sequence="4">390 JOEL ?. LIDOV or a third person?only the beginning and the myth can give us any clue to the prayer's intention. Theander observed the frequency of propemptica in the work of the Lesbian poets, and on the basis of the myth, argued for including this one in the group (139, 146-7).4) Wilamowitz's interpretation had supposed a public function for the poem, but some of the later critics took the prayer-form as an opportunity to claim, often with surprising vigor, that the fragment revealed the intensely personal voice so important to their view of Sappho.5) 2. Cletic or Apotropaic Prayer? A more specific difficulty with the common reading is that, unlike Wilamowitz's supplement in line 1, it does not conform to the archaic and classical usage of p??s???. This adverb cannot indicate 4) Cf. Treu 187-8. Fr?nkel (181-2 and ?. 31) and Merkelbach (23) accepted this, as?apparendy?did Page in a strikingly disingenuous litotes (the English irony confused Saake zKS 123): "There is nothing in the text to confirm the natural guess that what Hera is summoned to do for Sappho today is what she did for the Atridae in the past?to give fair winds and weather for a voyage from Lesbos; the comings and goings of Sappho's companions are among the commonest themes of her verse" (62). M. West (1970: 327) insists that the final line has room only for ?]?'?p??e[s?a?, and on the basis of this and of line 12 retains an understanding of the poem as an invocation of the god's presence at a ceremony; his text is printed by Campbell. Prof. Koenen assures me ( per litteras), on the basis of his reexamination of the pub- lished plate of the only source for this line, P.Oxy. 1231 (vol. 10, pi. II), that an eta better fills the space between rho and a reconstructed margin line. 5) So Saake (citing Schadewaldt), who holds it to be a "pers?nliches Preis- und Huldigungslied auf die oberste G?ttin" (SS 70). Treu (also citing Schadewaldt and rejecting a propempticon) makes it no less "ein ganz pers?nliches Gebet zu Hera". So strong is his commitment to this view that he writes "im Schlu?vers stand das Wort '(la? mich) gelangen'" and overlooks the fact that the first-person reference is his own supplement (187). Both Treu and Saake appear to be reacting against any notion that the poem could be directed to a formal social function, Wilamowitz's notion of a cult ceremony having been dismissed; cf. West (previous note). Page's conviction of the immaturity and triviality of the content makes the function mean- ingless (previous note), but a formal role for the poem is upheld by Merkelbach (1957: 5, 23-5) in accordance with his theory that Sappho's poetry belonged to the activities (usually weddings) of a "M?dchenbund"?in this case a propempti- con for a wedding journey is probable. Weddings are not the only possibility for a public concern. In his edition (1997: 273-6) Aloni places fr. 17 among those directed to a family group, but he has also argued (1983) that Sappho expresses the interests of a Lesbian mercantile class and a propempticon could fit this theory.</page><page sequence="5">HERA IN SAPPHO, FR. 17 L-P,V?AND AENEID I? 391 the direction or goal of motion; it shows only location, as in Sa. 31.3 (e???t??? t?? ?sd??e? ?a? p??s??? . .. ?pa???e?). It describes where someone is or was, but not where he will arrive (i.e., it is equiva- lent to iuxta, not prope), and so it could not function as the equiv- alent of de??? (prob. Sa. 2.1), t??de (Sa. 1.5), or de?te (prob. Ale. 34.1) in a cletic context, and it cannot be construed with the verb to indicate motion.6) But an archaic or classical summons, request- ing the god's appearance, always requests that the god travel from someplace to the speaker; it does not ask for the god simply to materialize on the spot. A god's add may be requested without a request for his appearance (as, apparently, in Sa. 5, and in Odysseus's prayer in //. 10.278-83, where he assumes Athena's guardianship in the present indicative), but if the personal presence is desired, travel from afar towards the petitioner is always anticipated (as in the Lesbian examples above and in Diomedes's prayer in //. 10.284- 94); in such prayers a word denoting travel through space is essen- tial to the idea.7) Such travel may have been requested at the end 6) This conclusion is based on a search through close to 300 uses from Homer to the early 4th century (including Plato and Demosthenes). The majority are either the idiomatic use of ? p??s??? as a substantive or attributive uses of the adverb simply describing one thing or person as being near another; correspondingly, the verb most often found with it is uncompounded e???. In addition, it is often used to show position with verbs meaning 'be present' (p??e???), 'sit', 'stand', 'lie', or 'dwell'; or 'place', 'put', or 'construct'. It is infrequently used with other verbs to locate the action 'nearby'. Euripides twice uses it with the perfect participle of a verb of motion (IA 1103, Cyc. 18); I take these also to show position. He twice uses it with ??fs?? in a hostile sense (Or. 257, Ba. 728); I take these to empha- size the physical nearness of the attacker, not passage through space. It is com- monly used for closeness in combat (cf. Archil. 128.3W, Tyrt. 11.38W) and there appears to be a military idiom, p??s??? ????es?a?, found in X. (Cyr. 4.2.15.5, 4.3.16.8 [bracketed]) and in a report of Hellanicus (S PI. Smp. 208d, so perhaps late), meaning 'take up a (hostile) position opposite'. The very late uses of this phrase to mean propinquum s(ive) proximum fien, prope accedere, cited in Stephanus's Thesaurus (1829: 7.1224), seem to be generalizations of this. In X. Cyr. 5.4.23.3, p??s??? . .. a?e?? t?? t???? of one army, following ?at?st?se? e?? t???? of another, the placement of the army, not its movement, is the point, although this is the best example of the adverb used to indicate the goal of motion. The only use of p??s??? with fa??es?a? occurs in the Hippocratean Epist. 15.15, to describe a vision of Asclepius in a dream. Fr?nkel's note in EGPP attributes to p??s??? the sense of assistance that in fact belongs to the verbs in his examples (E. Or. 1159, Od. 13.301). 7) For examples of the rule from drama, see Dorsch, 1983: 218 n. 97. When fa????a? or its compounds is used, it is supplemented by an actual verb of motion</page><page sequence="6">392 JOEL ?. LIDOV of the poem, making the poem as a whole a cletic hymn, but the opening invocation cannot be a summons, since the words after p??s??? must describe the position of something or someone and there is no room for another verbal construction independent of the adverb. Most probably, then, the missing words do not refer to the god (if the dream motif is rejected?I will assume that the other arguments against it stand), but to something created or caused by the god. There is a further difficulty with p??s??? d? ? [(??) that the adverb, unlike the adjective, is always construed with the genitive (which is never ??? in the Lesbians) when it is not used absolutely. Even if the adjectival construction could explain a dative here, the evidence makes it very unlikely as a supplement.8) In the second line, sa ?[a??essa ???fa was entirely appropriate to the dream theory, but it creates a problem for a cletic prayer. Note that e????e?a?, unlike the performative ??ss??a? of Poem 1, by itself adds nothing to the poem's meaning or description; if it is not otiose, it must be directing the audience's attention to the par- allel between the Singer's prayer and the Atridae's. So ???fa, as part of the prayer, must indicate that Hera physically appeared to the kings in response to their prayer, as Page explicitly states: "she is invoking Hera to make herself manifest to Sappho, as she once did to the Atridae" (p. 61, his emphasis).9) But that manifestation is not indi- (e.g., E. HF 494-5, Ar. Nu. 266-9, S. Ani. 1144-9, OT 164-6); cf. Ale. 34.1-3 ??p??te[? . . . p??[f?]??te, augmented by the description of their travel occupying lines 5-6. 8) A dative with the verb certainly takes precedence over the genitive with the adverb only in ?. IA 1551-2, sta?e?sa tf te???t? p??s??? / e?e?e, where the intro- duction of direct speech governs the construction. With pa?a-compounds, p??s??? is redundant, and apparendy adds an emphasis on closeness to the verbal con- struction, which may require the dative; so Ar. Ec. 725, ??? s?? pa?a??????? p??s???, where position while in motion is indicated. The two remaining exam- ples involve in addition the avoidance of multiple genitive constructions: E. Ph. 906 and Ar. Ec. 9 (p??s??? could be the adjective here). None of these possible, late-fifth-century exceptions would make a supplement of the dative appear prob- able here. 9) Similarly Furley and Bremer (2001: II 116) and Danielewicz (1974: 24-5), who proposes that the reminder of Hera's previous manifestation is in support of the prayer that would have followed. The supplement e??????a? is also suspect because Sappho's only other instances of a medio-passive participle are in fr. 2, the description of the sacred grove, which has three (in Alcaeus, only in 45.3, a</page><page sequence="7">HERA IN SAPPHO, FR. 17 L-?,V?AND AENEID I? 393 cated in any reconstruction of the poem's myth?there hardly seems room for it in lines 9-10, where it would have to fit?nor does it seem consonant with the appeal to the three gods. If ???fa does not emphasize a manifestation, it can only be a periphrasis for Hera's helpful presence; in that case, it adds nothing in particular, it has no parallels as a periphrasis, and there is no way to explain why it is used instead of the expected second-person verb.10) The possessive adjective in line 2 requires a noun designating something typical or characteristic of Hera; she has no personal attributes (like Aphrodite's smile) that would mark her presence, and in any case, such a feature would still be a m?tonymie substitute for 'you'. What is needed, then, despite Hera's lack of distinctive attributes, is a noun that implies a characteristic action that does not require her presence, like Apollo's arrows or Zeus's thunder- bolts, and that is relevant to the myth. Because ?[a??essa is not required, the adjective and noun in line 2 may describe something that Sappho is praying to avoid, rather than acquire?something that suggests a difficulty the singer wishes to prevent or overcome, as the Atridae secured their success over such a difficulty by their appeal to the Lesbian trinity. A negative prayer could be introduced by reading ?[? in line 1 instead of ?[??. II. 21.335 provides both an alternative to ?[a??essa and a particular evil sent by Hera that is also pertinent to this story of the Atridae's difficulties at sea: Hera tells Hephaestus that she will go to Zephyr and Notus, e? ????e? ?a?ep?? ??s??sa ??e??a?. description of flowing water); the form may have had a distinctive rhythmic or acoustic effect (no other middle form is restricted). 10) Page defended the supplement on the grounds of the frequency of "d??a? and e?d?? in descriptions of theophany in the Epic" (61 n. 1); but since these nor- mally emphasize the anthropomorphic character of the epiphany, ???fa would only be significant if Sappho were specifically requesting Hera to appear in human form. Nor is there a parallel in the periphrases with ???, ??, or ?????, which are applied to heroes (including Heracles) but not Olympians. Theander proposed replacing ???fa by ????a (147). Although this found favor with Fr?nkel (who proposed a hendiadys as a variant ?[???? ?d' ????a), the sug- gestion has been almost wholly ignored; it would not make much difference, since it is still a metonym for the god that does little to make the prayer more specific, and the third person construction?'may your pleasing aid appear (or come) to me'?is hardly a persuasive reading.</page><page sequence="8">394 JOEL ?. UDOV I suggest that we adopt these in line 2, and offer the following as an illustration of how they could have been part of an apotropaic prayer: p?as??? d? ? [? '?e?e? a?t' ????t?, p?t?G ???a, sa ?[a??pa ??e??a t?? ???ta? ?t[???da? p?t' e????- 4 t' ?? ?as???e?- 'Let not near to me again arise, Lady Hera, your harsh storm, which as a curse the Atridae once brought upon themselves, those kings, [Cf. Od. 14.522 dte t?? ?e???? . . . ????t?, //. 14.254 d?sas'. . . ??ta? and Ale. 6.1 t?d'a?te ???a; but e?e?e? and the choice of verb are arbitratry (?????? is not found with p??s??? but would mean 'arise on the spot'). With another verb (p??e??? is more typical) other gen- itives are possible, e.g., ?[? p????? pa?e??, or the adverb could be used absolutely, perhaps with a cult title in the vocative: ?[?, ?e??a, pa?e?? ('Let not be near, Hera Teleia'?a common title and appropriate to a prayer by Sappho even if not exampled in the Lesbians; however, according to Hamm, 1958: ?55, 27-8, an iota-diphthong arising from loss of sigma (-e??? &lt; *-es???) would, apparently, retain the iota.)11)] I will return to questions about the use of an apotropaic form and about the storm and Hera's role after looking more closely at several interlocked problems in the conclusion of the stanza. 3. ???ta?. . ^ - ???-t?? Wilamowitz's ?d?? p??-/t??, with a run-over to the adonean (and emphasizing the manifestation and the aetiology), created a struc- ture of a two-syllable verb followed by a run-over adjective that scholars have adhered to as if there were some evidence for it. So for the adjective we now find either ???-t?? or ???-t?? (although Voigt prints no supplements for lines 1-2; she accepts ???-/t??). For the verb there have been several offerings, with various interpreta- tions of the construction with ???ta?: Voigt cites ??sa? (Jurenka, and a modern favorite, accepted by Saake and Treu) and s????? (Diehl); Theander offered '?a???; Page, however, followed by 11) For the cult tide see Graf, 1985: 206, with further references.</page><page sequence="9">HERA IN SAPPHO, FR. 17 LP,V?AND AENEID I? 395 Campbell (in the Loeb) and Aloni (1997: 28-9), leaves the spot blank in his commentary. Difficulties begin to become apparent when we ask what the third line means, or should mean, in the common version. Is t?? ???ta? . . . ??sa? "deren Kult gestiftet" (Treu) or "welche . . . der Anbetung teilhaftig machten" (Saake, zKS)? Furley and Bremer (2001: II 116) keep ?d?? and explain "that the Atreidai saw Hera in answer to their prayers (???ta?) just as Sappho wishes to see Hera now" (their emphasis). Editors who omit the verb in the Greek text still commit themselves in translation: "che con scon- giuri invocarono" (Aloni), or only "to whom . . . made prayer(?)" (Page, Campbell). Theander renders ????a t?? ???ta? . . . '????? as "auxilium . . . quod implorandum olim didicerunt", which strains the Greek. Schadewaldt offered (without printing any text), "Die [= Hera] einst geneigt (sich machten der) Atriden / Ber?hmte K?nige" (25). No wonder Fr?nkel settled for a paraphrase of the first stanza "with free conjectural supplements": "may your gracious favor be present to help me as it once prospered the proud Atreid kings" (EGPP 181). The problem here is the same as it is with e??????a?. . . ???fa: in none of the reconstructions does the poem clearly express what the interpreters expect it to.12) The fact is that none of these verbs is satisfactory, for they all lack the augment, which is contrary to Sappho's usage, and the omission cannot be explained as aphaeresis or crasis with the pre- ceding -a?.13) After three-quarters of a century of conjectures, the structure assumed for the line now seems very unlikely. In addi- tion, there appears to be a rhythmic or stylistic difficulty; for there 12) In general, commentators have had difficulty making the common reading conform to their expectations. Schadewaldt uses this poem to introduce the cletic form ("ist alles nach der Regel", 26), as, more recently, does Williamson (1995: 133- 4). Saake echoes Schadewaldt (SS 69-70, zKS 123-4) but then demonstrates (cor- rectly) the poem's deviations. Williamson cites it in a translation (by Josephine Balmer) that changes the verb to the second person and rearranges the syntax of line three: Appear to me, lady Hera, I beg you / reveal your graceful form; for it was you who / once answered the prayers of the Atridae / illustrious kings'. 13) Lobel (1925: xl-xliii) discouraged all supplements without the augment; cf. Page, 77 ad 94.6, and Hamm (Voigt), 1958: 38, 161. This would explain why Page left the spot blank. Furley and Bremer defend the lack of augment and the observation of digamma in ?d?? as Homeric features justified by the Homeric con- tent?another example of the special pleading the common reading requires.</page><page sequence="10">396 JOEL ?. LIDOV are no other instances of a complete two-syllable word occupying the ninth and tenth syllables of any line of the stanza in either Sappho or Alcaeus.14) In addition to the problems it creates for the verb, the run-over to the adonean is itself a problem, no matter how one analyzes the colon sequence of the third and fourth line. Sappho allowed word- overlap here, but it is the exception rather than the rule (there is word-end before the adonean in more than 85 percent of the instances in Sappho, in 100 percent in Alcaeus), and we would expect it to be justified in context.15) So 31.3-4 ?p????-?e?s? and 11-2 f??e?-sa? refer to the poem's central motif of communication by speech and are inherently emphatic as part of the symptom list; in 1.11-2 the run-over extends the effect of a larger sound figure, pt??' ?p' ???????e-???, which features two elisions and synaloephe (there seems to be something similar in 2.3-4). Even the supplement in 30.3-4 [. . . ???-]fa? meets this standard, since that poem is prob- ably a wedding song of some type, and the stanza concludes with the bride. (A division within compounds or word-groups probably must meet a lower standard, but one can still see emphasis or con- 14) This is not simply a consequence of the avoidance of monosyllables in the eleventh position; cf. Sa. 1.2, 19, 23.7, 26.2, 16.3, 31.2, 4, Ale. 308.1, 362.3. About 165 lines can be read reliably in this position; the closest parallel would be within the word-group t????? de in 31.13. 15) So too S?nchez Lasso de la Vega, 1974: 83-4. I exclude from this discus- sion Sa. 39: ... p?da&lt;?&gt; de / p??????? ??s??? ?????pte, ??d?- / ?? ????? ?????, which exhibits both of the unusual word-placements under discussion. The text (cited in S Ar. Pax 1174 and, from p???????, by Pollux) appears to be quoted from the glossary tradition. The presentation as a sapphic stanza is made possible by Seidler's 1829 emendation of p?da, but the plural is otherwise both unnecessary (the singular would be a normal poetic idiom; see Tzamali, 1996: 210) and inel- egant (one shoe now covers two feet). More probably, the lines did not come from Book I; it would be better to omit de and invert the first two words: p??????? p?da ??s??? ?????pte, ??d??? ????? ????? .. . the word order is now less prosaic and the meter is still attested for Sappho (C3g in Voigt's conspectus). The editors (who are freer with over-runs than the papyri are?Seidler created two more, which have since been abandoned) also read a two-syllable word in the ninth and tenth position in 5.19, and supply an over-run to supplement the text: ]?e?[e?]a ?a?a? [-/- w ^ -]i. But a postpositive at line end is not excluded, and we should also note Photius's report (Sa. 137) that Sappho used the rare word ??a???; reading that here is not without difficulties, but is possible.</page><page sequence="11">HERA IN SAPPHO, FR. 17 L-P,V?AND AENEID I? 397 trast in 1.15-6 ??tt? / d??te, 19-20 ? / ??pf', 16.3-4 dt-t?.) ? foundation myth would be suitably emphasized by p??-t??, but ???- t?? (???-t??) is unlikely to have a specific reference in the story or situation. Indeed, the adjective is pointless. Sappho rarely, if ever, uses adjectives in the Sapphic stanzas that do not add a sensory detail (usually visual) or a religious significance to what is being described; we hardly need a descriptive word that tells us that the Atreid kings are renowned in story, least of all in a story about them, and a reminder to Hera of their epic status would not bol- ster Sappho's claim. I suggest, therefore, that t?? in line 4 be read as -t'??. The scribal practice of postponing the consonant before elision to the next line is illustrated in both papyri by the final adonean of the previous poem, -t&lt;*&gt; ???d???[t?. The resulting run-over would be so min- imal that it probably needs no justification, or none beyond the slight concessive emphasis from the climactic placement of ?? ?as???e?. The article here would be anaphoric, a verbal response to the unstated fact that the Atridae are well-known (Lobel, 1927: xxviii). This allows a middle verb to be placed at the end of the line; two or three syllable words, including verbs, are typical in this position.16) Finally, there is the question of the meaning of ???ta?. In her apparatus Voigt drew attention to a difficulty in the common read- ing: the adjective is rare in early Greek (//. 17.37 = 24.741, S. Ant. 972), and the other uses are in malam tantum partem. It is more help- ful to recognize that the use both of the third-person optative and of the derivative of a?a?a? indicates a religious attitude different from the one that would be implied by the supplements e????a? and ?a??essa. In an extensive examination of the different types of early Greek prayer, D. Aubriot-S?vin concludes that, outside of Homer, both a?a?a? and the use of the optative in prayer belong to the aspect of thought that treats the gods as powers who par- ticipate in quasi-automatic processes, often relating to justice, the 16) For third lines with a finite verb in this position, compare Ale. 34.5; Sa. 1.3, 24; 16.15 (elided); 34.3. Since this is a regular sense of the middle e????a? with goods or evils (see LSJ s.v. IV), this version of line three could perhaps also stand with the common version of lines 1-2, although in that context the parallel of Sa. 15.9 suggests that the active would be better.</page><page sequence="12">398 JOEL ?. LIDOV family and fertility, and death?the connection between forms of ara and 'curse' or 'magic' is an extension of this, not a primary meaning. Their use contrasts with the use of e????a? or the imper- ative, both of which treat the gods as persons whose charts can be sought.17) So with an antecedent describing something punitive, ???- ta? in fr. 17 would indicate that Hera sent the destruction as a necessary response to their unjust behavior, but it would also sug- gest that it could be deflected by the requisite compensatory or pro- pitiatory procedures. This interpretation would accord with the presence of a 'magical' element in Sappho's prayers that has often been acknowledged, ever since Cameron (1939: 3-4) noted it in his seminad discussion of Poem l.18) 17) 1992: 272-84, 295-405 passim, 506-11. He notes that Homer confuses the issue somewhat since he rejects any automatic, quasi-magical action in the reli- gious realm, and tends to present the gods as persons rather than powers (and makes use of a?a?a? to convey their intimate and effective presence). That explains why Pulleyn (1997: 70-6) found no significant differences between e????a? and ?????a? (and their corresponding nouns) in Homer; both are used in prayers for good and evil and they are used together. There are three possible uses of the adjective in a positive sense in the Odyssey: in the compound p??????t?? in 6.280 (cited by Voigt) and 19.404 and in the name of Queen ???t?. But the queen's name may reflect the fate of her father, who died young (Od. 7.63-6), and 19.404 is ambiguous, since the pejorative sense, although not intended by Eurycleia, explains Autolycus's answer (Peradotto, 1990: 138). Eurycleia's choice may also reflect the word's connection to fertility powers and refer to rituals assiduously per- formed rather than to prayers graciously answered. Similarly, the bystander whose sneers Nausicaa imagines in 6.280 may well be suggesting something beyond a prayer for divine favor in her search for an immortal to be her husband. Call. Aet. 24.9 is probably also double-edged, as Heracles addresses the ploughman who holds a ten-foot goad (and there may also be a play on ???t??). The pejorative connotation in fr. 17.3 was sufficiently distressing to a late reader that PSI 123 has the metrically erroneous ??ata? marked as an alternative (I am grateful to Dirk Obbink for bringing the significance of this to my attention; note that this reader's revision suggests a verb whose meaning is more like e????t' than ??sa?). No conclusions can be drawn from the apparent existence of a cult of '??a???? "???t?? in Macedonia (Hesych. s.v. "???t??

But the title could refer to his fate (driven into the northern lands by Hera's curse) or to his own violent aspect as a hero rather than to his accessibility. See further on Heracles, below. 18) Merkelbach drew attention to the 'magical' element in the form of the prayer here, with the warning that the modern sense of the term 'magic' is inap- propriate in this context (24-5).

The Apotropaic Invocation In the reading of the opening that I have proposed, the singer asks the god not to do something. A negative approach to a god is not typical of hymnic prayer, but there is a close Sapphic parallel in the Hymn to Aphrodite. Sappho's directness is distinctive; as Cameron noted (1939: 3-4), Poem 1 is unusual in that the god is addressed as the source of the same trouble that she is asked to dispel.19) Prayers which reverse the cletic formula and ask the god not to come are rare but do occur; e.g., E. Ale. 976-7 (to ??????), ?? ???, p?t??a, ?e???? e????? ? t? p??? e? ???, and Hipp. 528-9 (v. Barrett ad loe), (????)... ?? ??? p?t? s?? ?a?f fa?e??? ??d' ?????- ??? e????? (note the optative in both). In fr. 17, where there is no actual summons or rejection of the god herself, Sappho has based her prayer on the structure of a more informal apotropaic wish in which the god is asked to insure that something?expressed as the subject of a third person optative?does not happen: e.g., Pi. jV". 8.35 e?? ?? p?t? ??? t????t?? ????, ?e? p?te?, //. 16.97-8 a? ?a? ?e? te p?te? ?a? ????a?? ?a?

Such a wish may (by litotes) be equivalent to or may precede a request for divine (the passage may contain an allusion to fr. 17, because they both incorporate the paranomasia "??? / t??a and ???-/??a-). It has conventionally been translated 'gladly' (LSJ Supp.) or 'willingly', an ad hoc explanation accommodating the word to the meaning expected in the context (cf. Mineur, 1984 and Lanzara, 1990: ad loe). Callimachus's use conforms to the early meaning of ??at?? if we under- stand that it is witty and intentionally para prosdokian: it goes without saying that, because of the threats of "???, Leto wandered ???t??; but because Delos's rebuff of the goddess was so instan?y?we might say, magically?efficacious, Leto also ceased ???t??. 19) ?. Keyssner (cited by Cameron) observes that in such cases the evil is usu- ally attributed to some indefinite or impersonal agency and that in hymnic poetry, as distinct from epic and tragedy, the gods are represented as showing grace and favor; he cites only some Orphic hymns for showing an awareness of the gods' destructive power (1932: 97-8). It is clear that lyric shares epic and tragedy's aware- ness of the gods as a source of difficulty, but all prayers normally show the tact that Cameron describes. So in //. 6 Helenus, who can be presumed to know that Athene supports Diomedes, simply instructs Hector to have the women pray to her to restrain him (96); Theano, who speaks the actual prayer, makes it a posi- tive request by asking her to oppose him (306).</page><page sequence="14">400 JOEL ?.

If the adjective in line 3 refers to something baneful to the Atridae, the narrative is straightforward: the Atridae incurred a disaster directed by Hera, (even) those kings (stanza one), while returning from Troy by way of Lesbos (stanza two), which they overcame through prayer to Hera, Zeus, and Dionysus (stanza three), ??? de in line 11 must bring us back to the present. Without the full final stan- zas we cannot know for certain that the beginning was foil to a positive prayer at the end, but the most probable explanations of ?p??e[s?a? seems to me to be that the poem does end with a prayer either for someone to arrive safely or for the god to appear. As in Poem 1 the movement would be from a negative to a positive prayer, with the difference that the positive prayer, which is intro- duced in the second stanza of Sa. 1, is here fully postponed by the placement of the myth to the final part of the poem.20) The myth is formally introduced with a relative pronoun, in the hymnic style, as an auxesis of the god's dynameis (here the power to create a storm); it also provides an example of the efficacy of praying to the trin- ity, and would thus function (as the myth in Poem 1 does) as the sancito for a final request. And if it is also the foundation myth of the ritual?we have no way of knowing?it may additionally glo- rify the present performances by connecting them to their ancient origin as a propitiation for wrongs committed (as Pindar uses a ref- erence to the origins of the festivals at Thebes in commemoration of Heracles's slain children in /. 4.61 if. and at Rhodes in the purification of Tleptolemus in 0. 7.77 ff.).21) If we try to understand the poem's context from this content, we find that, like almost all the fragments, no matter how complete, this one gives us no details about its occasion. Among modern crit- 20) That would still be the case if the poem ends as West restores it, with a request for the god's (favorable) appearance at her rites. In the examples above, both Pindar and Achilles continue with positive wishes. 21) Page revised Wilamowitz's supplements in the second and third stanza to take account of Lobel's new readings and punctuated to make clear that t??de is 'hither' and not 'hence' (n.b.

Others might note that we do not even know that the singer is supposed to be Sappho herself, or wonder if this is the same kind of storm that imperils Alcaeus's ship of state. But whatever the context, this structure does allow us to suppose, even if only to suppose, that this poem would provide another display of how Sappho can achieve a psychological realism of general relevance when she begins with the presentation of a specific source of despair, and through a rec- ollection of the past, arrives at the expression of the trust in the gods that makes confidence in the future possible. 5. The Anger of Hera By any reading, Hera is prominent in the start of the poem, although it turns its attention to the whole of the Lesbian trinity. It is also certain that Sappho's version of the nostos illustrates H?ussler's remark about the role of Hera in Alcaeus's prayer to the trinity (Ale. 129 V): "der S?nger von Lesbos hat eben eine andere Perspektive als der S?nger von Chios", for Homer does not involve Hera and does not portray the brothers traveling homeward together.22) My suggestion that Sappho speaks of a storm in line 2 offers a possi- ble explanation for these differences in an allusion to an alternate narrative of the return, one in which Hera has a characteristic role. In Od. 3.150 ff., Nestor relates that the Atridae traveled sepa- rately, and he and Menelaus asked a (male) god on Lesbos only for a sign, to show them which course to take across the Aegean. There is no mention of a storm, or of any gods save Athene (at Troy), Zeus (before they reach Lesbos) and Poseidon (to whom alone 22) 1995: 85. The separate address to Hera has been cited as yet another sign of Sappho's personal involvement with the god, but it may be typical of the cult practice. Alcaeus invokes only Hera in the second person, in a manner very sim- ilar to 1. 9 here. But the emphasis of the first stanza calls for some kind of inter- nally consistent motivation.</page><page sequence="16">402 JOEL ?. LIDOV Nestor sacrificed in thanks once he had made a safe passage). In contrast, the narrative in A. Ag. 617-79 does emphasize a violent storm which afflicted both brothers, although it makes no mention of a stop on Lesbos. So perhaps it is Homer who is varying the tradition.23) Nestor's story in Od. 3.150 ff. is oddly lacking in cer- tain details, especially in the explanation of why he and Menelaus were separated on the way to Lesbos, where they rejoined (in 3.286 ff. he attributes a later storm to Zeus, which blew Menelaus to Egypt after he left Sounion). In general, Hera is absent from the Odyssey, where she appears as an agent only three times, always in character speech. In Proteus's narrative she is credited with saving Agamemnon, implicidy from the storm sent by Poseidon that afflicted Aias Oileus; yet two lines later Agamemnon himself, apparently off- course, is afflicted by a ??e??a that almost drives him to Aegisthus's ancestral home (Od. 4.513-5). S. West concludes (in Heubeck et al. 1988: ad 4.514-20) that this second storm, which is unmotivated and inconsequential, is an interpolation from another tradition of Agamemnon's return; whatever its origin in the Odyssey, the ele- ments of this story bring us closer to Sappho's narrative. Curiously, the juxtaposition of Hera and ??e??a occurs the two other times her activity is recalled: in 12.61-72 Circe warns Odysseus of the ??e??a? of fire surrounding the Planctae from which Hera saved Jason, and in 20.70, in Penelope's prayer to be carried off by a ??e??a, Hera is one of the goddesses who aids the daughters of Pandareos after they were carried off by ??e??a?. We are disposed by the Odyssey tradition to think of storms as typical of Poseidon, but Simon (1969: 45-7) has pointed out (using, especially, material evidence) that Hera is also associated with the sea, although typically (as in these Odyssey passages) as a savior, and that she also has other concerns, as a goddess of pasture animals, that overlap with Poseidon's. Given this overlap of functions, the general rule in Greek mythology that the gods harm in the same 23) For a discussion of the sources, see Page 59-60 with n. 1 (he asserts that the prayer of Od. 3.173 is to Zeus, which is at best only an inference). E. Fraenkel (1950: II 313 ad 1. 616) attributes the discrepancy between Aeschylus and the Homeric (and Cyclic) narrative to Aeschylus's desire to present the brothers as a like-minded pair, but does not note the alternative tradition in Sappho 17.</page><page sequence="17">HERA IN SAPPHO, FR. 17 L-P,V?AND AENEID I? 403 areas in which they help, and in particular, Hera's tendency (as Burkert (1985: 131-5) describes it) to be characterized by malice and implacable rage, and associated with patterns of destruction, disorder, and the return to order, it would not be surprising to find that she often brings disaster through storms at sea, as well as saves people from them. Hera's anger is most often associated with forced wanderings, as in Callimachus's story of Leto and in the myth of Io, and, of course, she is responsible for Heracles's labors. A windstorm or a storm at sea, as an instrument of such punishments, could be an event in such stories. In Iliad 21 the offer of a ??e??a plays no further part in the narrative, but whatever one's theory of Homeric composi- tion, it is not likely that this is an ad hoc invention to show Hera's eagerness to act, but rather that it draws on a preexisting motif.24) In Proclus's summary of the Cypria, she attacks Alexandros and Helen in this fashion, as they make their way to Troy: ?e????a de a?t??? ?f?st?se? "??a (?. 31, 1. 25 Davies).25) But the closest par- allel to what I take to be in Sappho's poem, and the best confirmation of the pattern, is to be found in the Iliad itself. In Book 15.25-30 Zeus reminds Hera how she sent a storm that drove a hero, after he departed from Troy, across the sea to an island from which Zeus had to rescue him, so that he could return to Argos: ?????? ?d??? ??a????? ?e????, t?? s? ??? ????? ????f pep????sa ??e??a? p???a? ?p' ?t???et?? p??t?? ?a?? ??t???sa, ?a? ??? ?pe?ta ???? d' e? ?a??????? ?p??e??a?. t?? ?e? ???? ???e? ??s???? ?a? ????a??? a?t??

The same story is related by Sleep in 14.250-6 (note especially 253- 4: ... s? de ?? ?a?? ??sa? ???f / ??sas' ???a???? ??e??? ep? p??t?? ??ta?). 24) In 23.192-216 Iris summons the winds to aid another fire, but no word for 'storm' occurs there, and the need for winds is developed within the context. 25) Herodotus gives a report that contradicts this (2.117 = Cypria F 11 Davies), but even if Proclus invented it to explain the trip to Sidon in //. 6.290-2, it would still represent a traditional understanding of the sort of thing that Hera does. However, they need not be reporting exacdy the same version of the Cypna.</page><page sequence="18">404 JOEL ?. LIDOV A tradition that Hera sent a windstorm that forced the returning Argive kings off course to Lesbos would be in accord with the hints in the surviving portions of fr. 17 and would be an instance of a characteristic pattern of action. There is no evidence for the par- ticular reason for her anger, but it is a pervasive feature of the return stories that the disasters that befell the heroes were not sent by the gods who had opposed them at Troy, but were caused by offenses to the gods who had, in varying degrees, favored them. It is not difficult to suppose that Sappho is referring to a version fea- turing such an incident. (If Hera did not create the obstacle that the Atridae face, she is being asked to intervene with one of the other gods, which is much farther from the traditions we know.) The reading I have proposed makes Sappho's poem a witness to a tradition that has been put aside in the Odyssey and in post- Homeric mythology. But together with the Heracles story from Iliad 14 and 15, it does provide a second source for Juno's storm in Aeneid 1. In assigning Poseidon's obstructive role from the Odyssey to Juno, Virgil would also have been drawing on an archaic pat- tern typical of stories about both gods.26) And he might have had the Atridae's misadventure in mind when he sent his hero to a city like the one in Lesbos, where a woman became famous for her love (and in legend for her suicide) and where Hera is worshipped side- by-side with Aphrodite. Queens College and the Graduate Center City University of New York lidov@qc.edu 26) The replacement of Poseidon by Juno is discussed by della Corte (1985: 753). To the best of my knowledge, the role given Juno in Aeneid 1 has always been derived entirely from internal motives (although Conington &amp; Netdeship note on line 80, nimborumque facts tempestaiumque potentem, that Virgil probably refers to "some physical theory or legend connected with the character of Juno as queen of air"; this would be a Stoic allegory, '??a &lt; a??). Despite the similarity to Juno's action there, neither Iliad 21.335 nor the persecution of Heracles appears in the list of recognized Homer citations in the Aeneid compiled by Knauer (1964).</page><page sequence="19">HERA IN SAPPHO, FR. 17 ?^?,??AND AENEID I? 405 BIBLIOGRAPHY Aloni, ?., Eteria e tiaso.
