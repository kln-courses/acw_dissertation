<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COMPARATISI FANTASTIC LABYRINTHS IN FICTIONS BY BORGES, CORTAZAR, AND ROBBE-GRILLET by Doris T. Wright The genre of the Fantastic and the theme of the Labyrinth link "The South," that maze of deceptive realism that Jorge Luis Borges calls his best story, "The Night Face Up," Julio Cortázar's tale of vacillation between the dream and the real, and In the Labyrinth by Alain Robbe-Grillet, yet another masterpiece of false forays into space, time, causality, and poetic language, ļlie plots of all three fictions contain what Tzvetan Todorov considers the essential requirement of the Fantastic genre: constant creation of doubt within the mind of the reader about the reality or illusoriness of what is being shown.1 Surprisingly, the plots of these stories by two Argentinians and one French author are identical: a wound leads the protagonist to move about, or dreams he moves about, in deliri- um, with confusion about his identity and relentless progression toward ultimate death. The type of wound received in each of the tales carries great significance, linking the protagonists to each other, to their dreams, and to the reality of their modem conditions in fantastically labyrinthine ways. In the interest of parallel- ism I will shorten the part treated in the Robbe-Grillet novel to its penultimate section, which ends with the soldier's death. In Borges' tale the librarian hero Juan Dahlmann, a reader and dreamer, incurs his wound while rushing upstairs to examine a book. In his excitement he does not notice a half-open, newly-painted door against which his forehead brushes, but the paint poisons him. Later in a sanitarium he apparently recovers from the septicemia and is looking forward to visiting a ranch, once owned by his gaucho ancestor, which he had repurchased and long dreamed of but never seen. That journey South takes place only in the dying man's dreams; however, Borges' story is constructed with immense cleverness, and the reader, given mis- leading clues, cannot decide whether the journey is actually taking place in physical or imaginative space. The concealing yet revealing ambiguities and hints in such cryptic phrases as "Reality favors symmetries and slight anachro- nisms," "a second before his eyes registered the phenomena themselves he recalled. . . ," and "All these things were accidental, casual, like dreams of the plain," mesmorize the reader completely. Throughout the dreamed or allegorical tale the hints continue. Near the very end of the story the words "They would not have allowed such things to happen to me in the sanitarium, he thought" should clearly tell us that the protagonist has not been operating within physical- ly concrete walls, but the illusion of reality that has been given through the bril- liantly convincing details still keeps the reader from breaking through into realization of the gigantic hoax being played upon him. Sustaining that reader hesitation is what keeps this tale staunchly within the Fantastic genre, but should the spell be broken, one might realize that this story is in fact just like Cortázar's. Both are classical reversals of the old ending for false-Fantastic tales, "It was all a dream." Actually, false-Fantastic tales themselves are but retellings of the but- terfly fable of Chuang Tzu, a Chinese Taoist sage of the fourth century B. C. who with wit and originality expounded the doctrines of Lao-tzu. Here is Chuang Tzu's famous butterfly dream, well known to Borges since he recounts it in his Antología de la literatura fantástica : 29</page><page sequence="2">FANTASTIC LABYRINTHS Once upon a time, Chuang Chou [Tzu] dreamt that he was a butterfly, fluttering happily like a butterfly. He was conscious only of his happiness as a butterfly, unaware that he was Chuang Chou. Suddenly he awakened, and there he was, veri- tably Chuang Chou himself. Now he does not know whether the butterfly is a dream of Chuang Chou or whether Chuang Chou is a dream of the butterfly.2 Of course the Borges tale has other important messages besides the ques- tioning of reality. The theme of masculine courage, presented in the Borges tale through the code of the Argentinian gaucho, is a concern of vital importance in the Cortázar tale, with its lusty young motorcyclist and physically adept Moteca, and also in the Robbe-Grillet novel with its war-and-soldier content. That physi- cal courage is the highest Argentinian virtue, beside which book-knowledge is inferior, is a basic idea in "The South" wherein, under the imminence of death, Dahlmann ("doll man") rejects his reader-librarian role as he travels on the imaginary train towards his sturdier primitive, "real self* in the archaic South. Borges1 librarian discovers himself at last in his heroic gaucho ancestor, the sub- ject of his life-long, unrealized longings. Paradoxically, the modern librarian, a feminized man, is freed finally from die false dreams associated with the books that have poisoned this descendant of courageous, physically-real gauchos only at his death; and ironically, he has not really been freed at all, for his return to the heroisms of the past that are missing in the life of the present are only more hallucinations. The wound in "The Night Face Up" similarly is the cause of all that will follow. Just as borges' bookworm brings about his ultimate death by rushing upstairs to examine a book, in the Cortázar tale an unnamed young man, unre- flectingly at home in the modern mechanized city, is punished for his yielding to the false gods of the technological age. Riding along with stupid serenity on his motorcycle down the Buenos Aires streets, Cortázaťs protagonist suffers an accident at an intersection. Suddenly the gleaming, powerful machine upon which he had been riding is lying on top of him, its tremendous tonnage now rid- ing, and lethally crushing, its former rider. Taken to a hospital and operated upon for his injuries, he finds himself, heart pounding in fear, to be a Moteca Indian being pursued by Aztecs in some age long past but now intolerably present as his menacers close in upon him. It is the time of the war of the blos- som, the ritual war in which Aztecs took Motecas and other Indians prisoners for bloody sacrifice. Gratefully the injured motorcyclist wakes up to find himself in the safety of the modern hospital, but again he lapses back into the fearful reality of being pursued through labyrinths of swamps and quaking bogs full of marshy smells, running with his sole chance of escape the narrow labyrinthine trail that only they, the Motecas, knew. Again he wakes in the hospital, but once again he is being pursued, and now with no hope of escape. At the tale's end the impos- sible Ufe of the past has come to seem all there is. The young man tries val- iantly, frantically, to awaken from his nightmare, but the Moteca is not to return to safety and life, for, smelling death irresistibly now, he opens his eyes to see not the hospital room but the executioner-priest approaching him with the fatal stone knife in his hand, and ... he knew now he was not going to wake up, that he was awake, that the marvelous dream had been the other, absurd as all dreams are - a dream in which he was going through the 30</page><page sequence="3">THE COMPARATISI strange avenues of an astonishing city, with green and red lights that burned without fire or smoke, on an enormous metal insect that whirred away between his legs.3 Modern life, to this protagonist thrown back completely into history, is finally recognized as "the infinite lie." He is at last truly himself, a nameless Moteca victim in the war of the blossoms whom the stone-knife executioner has killed and whom the other Aztecs now pick up off the ground where he, like the name- less hospital victim, had been lying face up, on his back; he is hurled to roll down the endless north steps of the great terrace of sacrifice. The third wound of these fictions, the wound of the soldier in the Robbe- Grillet novel, is treated with complete cynicism, debasing the myths of the hero- ism of war and of the glorious role of the soldier. The reader may even be deal- ing not with one wound of one individual soldier, but with a number of wounds of various soldiers described in the narrative. Evidence exists within the text for both assumptions. Here there is no conflict between Moteca and Aztec sancti- fied by religious belief in blood sacrifice, nor is there the stirring thrill of the gaucho facing death at the hands of mysterious natives; instead, a colorless, nameless soldier wounded in a battle that was lost meanders through a colorless, nameless city on the eve of its occupation by the enemy. This nondescript dying man moves in and out of delirium as he moves in and out of the streets and occa- sionally the buildings as he tries to deliver an insignificant package for a dead comrade. The contrast between the view of war by the French author, who had lived through war's unglamor, and the views of the rojnanticizmg Argentinians^ stands in brutal relief. Suddenly their brilliant modern twentieth century fictions seem to fall back into the nineteenth century, leaving this drab dull twentieth century fiction to face the present and the future alone, for in Robbe-Grillet's In the Labyrinth there is none of the thrill of the chase, none of the glamorizing of a mythical, primitive past. Instead, all is deadened, flattened, denied hope. Romanticism has always been linked with nature, and it is noteworthy that the finding of the self that takes place in the tales of the Argentinians is associat- ed with a return to nature. Dahlmann gets a knife (symbolic penis) that enables him to assume at last the physically courageous gaucho role he has long uncon- sciously desired, and the nameless motorcycle rider is catapulted back into an era where every second of life is charged with thrilling danger and the question of survival of the very sun-god himself. In Robbe-Grillet's tale, however, there is no Saturnine nature to which one may escape. His labyrinth is not a train winding to a goldenly primitive South, not a maze of confused stumblings through a rich, rank jungle. Instead, it leads through streets of an abstracted metropolis, formulaic streets all marked by identical lamposts, with city rooms so interchangeable that the soldier and the reader both, hoping to anchor them- selves somehow to the concrete, cling desperately to tangibles like red velvet drapes and checkered oilcloths. Nature in the unnamed city might be represent- ed by snow, which is mentioned on the third page of the tale, but even the snow is untrustworthy, weather itself proving totally unreliable, as the opening para- graph of In the Labyrinth wams us: I am alone here now, under cover. Outside it is raining, out- side you walk through the rain with your head down, shielding your eyes with one hand while you stare ahead nevertheless, a few yards ahead, at a few yards of wet asphalt; outside it is cold, the wind blows between the bare black branches; the 31</page><page sequence="4">FANTASTIC LABYRINTHS wind blows through the leaves, rocking whole boughs, rocking them, rocking, their shadows swaying across the white rough- cast walls 4 Here there is no snow but rain, although the narrative from the first to the third page did not give any other indications of a change of scene. What the weather is here in the first paragraph just quoted, what the season itself is, cannot be determined, autumn and winter and spring being equal possibilities. Bare black branches transform themselves into leafy boughs with total unconcern for con- sistency, believability. Like space, time is subverted in all three of the writers under consideration. Ostensibly Borges shows linear time in the journey back in space to the South of the past; but the time that Borges is really concerned with is not linear but recur- rent. The time which links Juan Dahlmann at the moment of death with his gau- cho ancestor, him of the old sword, that blank-faced man (the space is blank because it is waiting for Juan's face) in the daguerreotype - that time is not linear. Time is a veritable obsession with Borges. Roger Caillois in the essay "Les thèmes fondamentaux de Jorge Luis Borges" remarks that Borges reported hav- ing received the revelation of circular time one specific autumn night in a Buenos Aires boulevard.5 Borges himself noted that illumination concerning time in various works. One of his most famous quotes, in fact, concerns his being in relation to time, and the tenor of thought takes us all the way back to Chuang Tzu and his butterfly dream that dealt with the question of personal identity: Time is the substance of which I'm made. Time is a river which arrests me, but I am the river; it's a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it's a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire. The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges.6 Cortázar's concern with time is also central to his tale, wherein the name- less protagonist is set on a continuous bouncing from one era to another. However, when he is within either time frame, past or present, that protagonist is firmly anchored, which cannot be said of either Borges' or Robbe-Grillet's pro- tagonists. Like Borges, and like his fellow countrymen Henri Bergson and Marcel Proust, Robbe-Grillet theorized about time memorably. In For a New Novel he asks, "Why seek to reconstruct time of clocks in a narrative which is concerned only with human time? Is it not wiser to think of our own memory, which is never chronological?"7 Most of the narration of In the Labyrinth uses the present tense, the time of "now," for the truest labyrinth in the work may not be the perplexing arrangement of metropolitan streets but the maze of the sol- dier's own mind. To confuse time with memory and thought is indeed absolute- ly central to Robbe-Grillet's project for a new novel, which aims, he says, "at a total subjectivity."8 Robbe-Grillet's ideas of what constitutes a total subjectivity may seem more clear in theory than in actual practice, but they led to some of the most interesting experiments in fiction of our time. Robbe-Grillet rejected the nineteenth century psychological novel in favor of a purged art where the form of the novel is itself the content. "The new novel," explains this author who had been an engineer and so might be presumed to have an objective orien- 32</page><page sequence="5">THE COMPARATISI tation towards life and art, "is interested only in humans and their situation in the world."9 Part of the human condition in the world is to deal with the labyrinths of space and time, but one must also deal with causality and the labyrinths of illogi- cality and contradiction in a world we view, as Kant has shown us, through the prison of our own mental structures and capacities. Borges', Cortázar's, and Robbe-Grilleťs fictional presentations, all three, have wrought havoc with the straight highways of logic and follow instead the forking paths in the Borges garden. Borges focuses on the question of order and chaos in the universe itself. Comments Ana Maria Barrenechea in Borges , The Labyrinth Maker : Borges attacks those fundamental concepts on which the security of living itself is founded: the universe, personality, and time. The universe is converted into a meaningless chaos abandoned to chance or ruled by inhuman gods, or perhaps into a ciphered cosmos whose secret key cannot be found. Personality is dissolved within pantheism. Motion disinte- grates time and deceitfully promises eternity. Along with this, the reader senses the constant presence of infinity which demolishes and overwhelms him, or sees matter disappear in reflections, dreams, and images along those lines of idealistic philosophy or religious and legendary ideas which nullify itē10 Caillois also links Borges1 principle themes of circular time, space, and cau- sality as they wind labyrinthinely in recurrent creation. From these he says Borges derived his constant symmetries, games with mirrors, systems of corre- spondences and equivalences, compensations, and secret balances constituting the substance and structure of the stories and poems.11 However, Robbe-Grillet is a match for Borges in dealing with order and chaos through fiction. His laby- rinthine city mimics the meanderings of his protagonist's consciousness, as well as the mind of the reader hopelessly losing itself, briefly anchoring itself on something, and then again losing the thread of logic and even sanity. What lies behind this urge in all three writers to create labyrinths of space, time, and causality? Jaime Alazraki gives this explanation: The common denominator [is]. . . a relativism that obliges us to see the truth in perpetual movement, that incites us to tran- scend beyond daily monotony and to discover new values and new dimensions. That relativism arises from an essential skepticism.12 Alazraki expresses the sentiment that a relativistic vision cannot be presented in any other way than by labyrinthine picture of space, time, and causality. And what of the labyrinth of language? Of prosaic versus poetic language? Language is the medium of fiction, but the language used in art, and fiction is an art, is not prosaic but poetic language. Not factual accounts or scientific accounts of human experience are being expressed and received in the stories under discussion, but poetic accounts. Meaning will be conveyed through vari- ous poetic and rhetorical devices long ago recognized, will it not? 33</page><page sequence="6">FANTASTIC LABYRINTHS Robbe-Grillet answers in the negative. The French engineer is against met- aphor, vehemently against it. Indeed, he constructs a whole theory of the new novel on this negative attitude, insisting in his chapter "Nature, Humanism, Tragedy" that metaphor is never an innocent fire of speech, that analogy is an anthropomorphic process that introduces a subterranean communication of "cor- respondences" that are not there. We should do away in fiction with metaphor and analogy, he feels. All analogies are dangerous, destructive. "The idea of an interiority always leads to the idea of a transcendence," he says, and he believes transcendence to be a lie.13 The cruel fact of life, as he sees it, is that "Man looks at the world, and the world does not look back at him." Solitude, instead of contact, is our nature. Existentialism, that sense of absurdity that his kinsmen Camus and Sartre and others represent, he sees only as a form of tragic human- ism. "Absurdity is in neither man nor things, but in the impossibility of estab- lishing between them any relation other than strangeness."14 Rejecting the humanist view that the world is man, Robbe-Grillet tries to confront objects coldly, through description, without either identification or projection.15 He describes, and beyond what he describes there is nothing. The mysterious pack- age that the wounded soldier is wandering around trying to deliver for a dead friend contains no great secret that will affect the war, it turns out to be only a package of mundane, paltry, personal effects, of value only to a few people who have known and cared about the isolated individual who kept them in that shoe- box and who, through, fate, came to be caught up in the myths of nationalism and war. The wounds of soldiers are here no badges which, worn, will gain them entry into some Valhalla, nor will their blood shed or unshed keep the sun in its course; the wounds are but the violations of the flesh which will kill their bearers. Borges situates himself philosophically at the other end of the language spectrum, yielding to the poetic language that Robbe-Grillet so strenuously denies. Essentially a mystic, Borges despairs of finding God because he believes in Him so much, despairs of locating particulars because his sense of the universal is so strong. Says Alazraki, "In die events of Borges reality is seen 'under the mirror of eternity,' that is to say, not the particular but the general, not individual beings but archetypes."16 Borges may present a dream world, but that which sees the dream world is ultimately fixed, positioned, and the contrast between the fixity and the dream fiction and the secredy-positioned archetypal entity creates the tremendous tension in his works. He gives himself away in this paragraph from Otras inquisiciones : / We (the indivisible divinity that works in us) have dreamed the world. We have dreamed it resistant, mysterious, visible, ubiquitous in space and firm in time; but we have consented its tenuous architecture and eternal interstices of unreason in order to know that it is false.17 A believer in spite of himself, Borges wages incessant war against his own belief, denying the single correspondence between signifier and signified, and seeking refuge in multiplicity, a refuge that forever disappoints him. In his theoretical works Robbe-Grillet expresses the desire for logic and for a spare, algebraic language, yet the previously quoted first paragraph of In the Labyrinth by the French author acknowledges that strict, scientific logic runs up against the richness of contradictions at every turn. Borges starts off "The 34</page><page sequence="7">THE COMPARATISI South" with what sounds like the most factual account possible of a person's ancestry, but the real-life librarian spends his story revealing the hidden depths of the transparently clear historical perspective he had supposedly established. As for Cortázar, "The Night Face Up" not only straddles the two worlds of the real and the illusory, his story actually begins with the crucial word "halfway," and the labyrinthine question of correspondence of word and world is opened up to wind in and out and around, and then double back all over again. For good reason. These important artists are voicing the feelings of all of us caught in a fantastic labyrinth between the magical, supernatural world of the past to which we wish, perhaps mistakenly, that we could return and the scientific, supranatu- ral worlds of the present and of the future which we wish, again perhaps mista- kenly, that we could escape. University of Wisconsin-Madison NOTES In The Fantastic . A Structural Approach to Literary Genre. (New York: Cornell University Press, 1973), Todorov gives a succinct survey of the Fantastic as a genre, stat- ing that it "is based essentially on a hesitation of the reader - a reader who identifies with the chief character - as to the nature of an uncanny event." (157) Todorov explains that this hesitation of the reader, this hovering between classification of an uncanny event or series of events, may be resolved so that the event is acknowledged as reality, or as the fruit of imagination or deception. The state of exciting, baffling, frustrating but pleasura- ble hesitation in the reader before his or her decision concerning the meaning of the events is irrevocably made is what gives the Fantastic its charm, and power to charm, as a genre.
