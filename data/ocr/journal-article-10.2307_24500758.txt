To this day, many textbooks use Tinber gen's four problems, or 'four whys', to introduce students to behavioural Keywords: biology [2,3], Tinbergen did not, of course, write about mirror neurons mirror neuron, associative learning, (MNs). However, in this article, I use his four problems to draw out the differ sensorimotor experience, Tinbergen's four ences between two well-developed accounts of MNs—the 'genetic view' and problems, functional analysis, inference to the the 'associative account'-and to explain why these differences matter. This I seems appropriate given that the discovery of MNs was another highly signifi cant development in behavioural biology; MNs also had a birthday recently (mere striplings at 20 years old) and the genetic view of MNs has been Author for correspondence: shaped by ethological principles. I hope to show that, although the associative Cecilia Heyes account did not emerge from ethology, it is entirely compatible with that tra e-mail: cecilia.heyes@all-souls.ox.ac.uk dition' Indeed'1 arSue that a careful reading of Tinbergen's four problems [4] reveals that he was advocating a type of functional analysis which, according to the associative view, should be a high priority for future research on MNs. In a recent article [5], my colleagues and I briefly recommended some new directions for MN research. Drawing on work in the philosophy of biology and cognitive science, as well as empirical literatures in psychology and neuroscience, this article explicates and extends those recommendations. For example, it explains exactly what is meant by 'system-level' or 'func tional' analysis, why it is important, and how it could be applied in research on MNs. In the first section, I give a brief overview of the genetic and associative accounts of MNs. In the second section, I discuss each of Tinbergen's four problems, reviewing data on the causation and ontogeny of MNs that dis tinguish the genetic and associative accounts, and noting that the evolution and survival value of MNs have not been studied in a systematic way. In the final section, I argue that, in combination, Tinbergen's discussion of survival value and the associative account motivate important new directions for MN research.

Tinbergen on mirror neurons Cecilia Heyes Fifty years ago, Niko Tinbergen defined the scope of behavioural biology with his four problems: causation, ontogeny, survival value and evolution. About 20 years ago, there was another highly significant development in be havioural biology—the discovery of mirror neurons (MNs). Here, I use Tinbergen's original four problems (rather than the list that appears in textbooks) to highlight the differences between two prominent accounts of MNs, the genetic and associative accounts; to suggest that the latter provides the defeasible 'best explanation' for current data on the causation and onto geny of MNs; and to argue that functional analysis, of the kind that Tinbergen identified somewhat misleadingly with studies of 'survival value', should be a high priority for future research. In this kind of func tional analysis, system-level theories would assign MNs a small, but potentially important, role in the achievement of action understanding—or another social cognitive function—by a production line of interacting component processes. These theories would be tested by experimental intervention in human and non-human animal samples with carefully documented and controlled developmental histories. &gt; 2014 The Author(s)</page><page sequence="2">before learning (b) correlated sensorimotor experience (c) after learning visual system left right left right power power precision precision grip grip grip grip power precision grip grip grasping grasping power precision grip grip left right left right power power precision precision grip grip grip grip motor system visual system left right left right power power precision precision c'WtfSMi grip grip grip grip iSf ir " power ^recisioiK gnjsC grip js? gg grasping ... h m Κ grasping power^precision grip_ 5fwk ^à ** SI * left right left right SEngP power power precision precision grip grip grip grip motor system visual system left right left right power power precision precision grip grip grip grip power precision grip grip grasping grasping power precision grip grip W left right left right r power power precision precision grip grip grip grip motor system » i1 ON vo &lt;Z&gt; oo before learning (b) correlated sensorimotor experience (c) after learning visual system left right left right power power precision precision grip grip grip grip power precision grip grip grasping grasping power precision grip grip left right left right power power precision precision grip grip grip grip motor system visual system left right left right power power precision precision grip grip grip grip jpv·. jjfi power precision -45 gnP"· grip JR.· Ήώΐ £ ■xagjT grasping grasping 5fwk Tji ** power power precision precision motor system visual system left right left right power power precision precision grip grip grip grip power precision grip grip grasping grasping power precision grip grip ψ left right left right r power power precision precision grip grip grip motor system Figure 1. Mirror neurons from associative learning, (a) Before learning, sensory neurons in the superior temporal sulcus, encoding visual descriptions of observed action, are not systematically connected to motor neurons in premotorand parietal areas involved in the production of similar actions, (b) Through self-observation and social interaction (e.g. being imitated, synchronous activity) in the course of typical development, agents receive correlated sensorimotor experience; they see and do the same action at about the same time (contiguity), with one event predicting the other (contingency). This experience produces correlated activation of sensory and motor neurons coding similar actions, and, through associative learning, strengthens connections between these neurons (c). Owing to these connections, neurons that were once involved only in the execution of action will also discharge during observation of a similar action; motor neurons become MNs. Because the visual system and motor system are organized hierarchically, some types of sensorimotor experience produce correlated activation of sensory and motor neurons coding relatively low-level features of action (e.g. left or right hand, power or precision grip), and thereby generate strictly congruent, hand- and direction-sensitive MNs. Other types produce correlated activation of neurons coding relatively high-level features (e.g. grasping), and generate broadly congruent MNs. Reprinted with permission from Cook et al. [5].

However, with considerable foresight, Tinbergen low-level features of action such as the hand used for grasping saw ethology as 'moving towards a fusion with the fields (left or right), direction of movement (left-to-right or right-to conventionally covered by Neurophysiology and Physiologi- left) [15], distance from the observer [18] and the observer's cal Psychology' (p. 416).

When a monkey observes itself perform The associative view suggests that MNs are not selectively ing a precision grip, the excitation of sensory and motor responsive to high-level features of action, to action 'goals' populations encoding a specific grip are correlated. However, [13]. It acknowledges that early research seemed to indicate when feeding in a group, a monkey might observe and perform this kind of selectivity; for example, to show robust MN a range of grasping actions, thereby causing correlated excitation responses to object-directed actions, and little or no responding of higher-level visual and motoric descriptions of grasping, to pantomimed and object-free actions [14,15].

MNs constitute a genetic adaptation for action understand ing, their development must involve, not necessarily epigenetic inheritance, but complex mechanisms of gene expression.

However, it Recent discussions of the action understanding hypothesis suggests that if we go looking for that history, using the suggest that MNs mediate one kind of action understanding— methods prescribed by Tinbergen for the investigation of phylo 'understanding from the inside as a motor possibility'—and geny and selection, we will find only the evolutionary history of acknowledge other 'visual' and 'semantic' types of action visuomotor control in primates, and of associative learning in all understanding [10]. This is certainly an advance, but func- vertebrates; that there is no point in the primate lineage, or else tional analysis requires theories that postulate pathways of where in the tree of life, where MNs evolved by gene-based interacting processes, rather than classifications of fixed natural selection. To return to an earlier analogy, the associative types. For the kind of analysis Tinbergen recommended, at account suggests that it would be no more productive to inves minimum, we would need system-level theories explaining tigate the genetic (rather than cultural) evolution of MNs than to the causal relations between visual action understanding, investigate the genetic (rather than the cultural) evolution of semantic action understanding and understanding 'from the neurons that detect visual word forms [79]. We know that read inside', and how they together produce the action understand- ing 'recycles' evolved capacities for object recognition [77], in ing manifest in effective social behaviour. However, even this much the same way as MNs 'recycle' capacities that evolved may not be enough. As long as the putative function of MNs is for visuomotor control and associative learning, but reading is described in a Trig' way—in terms of 'action understanding'— too young—print was invented too recently—to have a distinc rather than a 'small' way—for example, as visual activation of five genetic evolutionary history. We do not know the age of correlated motor programmes—it is likely to be hard to get MNs—for example, when they first began reliably to develop beyond explanations like: 'the monkey was able to understand in the course of human ontogeny—but the associative account the human's action because it has MNs that understand suggests that, if MNs have an evolutionaiy history of their action'. As Sober has pointed out, this kind of 'Chinese box' own, it is a history based on cultural rather than genetic or 'Russian doll' explanation can have some value in science; inheritance. it is not inevitably as empty as the suggestion, in Moliere's Although research on the genetic evolution of MNs is unli joke, that a sleeping potion engenders sleep because it has kely to be fruitful, functional analysis of MNs—of the kind I 'dormative virtue' [78]. For example, if we want to know believe to have been recommended by Tinbergen in his dis why a particular animal is able to digest certain nutrients, it cussion of survival value—could be very exciting indeed. It can be informative to leam that the creature is host to parasites could tell us about the nature of 'action understanding'; that can digest these nutrients. However, if we want to know about the interacting processes, each of them simple, that about the nature of digestion, about the kind of processes that together constitute 'action understanding'. A close reading constitute digestion, it is of little value to be told that the locus of Tinbergen brings functional analysis—in relation to survi of digestion is, strictly speaking, the parasite rather than the val value and to more proximate system properties—out host [78].
