<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. 8, pp. 289-3 10 J. N. CHUBB Formerly Professor of Philosophy, Bombay University PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE I would like to explain the point of view from which this paper is written. And this in itself will be a difficult task. In a religious dialogue we could be concerned in some way with questions which arise as a result of serious differences in doctrines between adherents of different religions or religious faiths. The ensuing debate or dialogue could take the form of an argument conducted from points of view that are distinctly partisan. If two doctrines are or are taken to be in head-on collision with each other by those who accept these doctrines, the holder of one doctrine would argue with the holder of the other doctrine with the object of showing that he is partly or wholly in error. If two statements both claiming to have truth-value are, or are taken to be, inconsistent with each other, then it is clear that one or both of them are or must be taken to be partly or wholly false. To attempt to show by marshalling reasons that the proposition inconsistent with that which one holds is wholly or partly false is what I mean by the partisan approach. The approach in a dialogue is partisan even if truth is claimed and the opposing 'error' exposed by reference to authority; for so long as there is to be a dialogue the setting up of a particular authority or of an authority specified in a particular way has to be justified by reasoning or at least a show of reasoning. If reasoning flows from and terminates in an authority without flowing beyond it and around it, so to speak, the fact that that 'authority' is not accepted by the other party is sufficient to bring the dialogue to an immediate end, leaving room only for a futile talking at cross purposes. In contrast to the partisan approach the problem or set of problems I wish to raise can and, I think, should, be discussed from a non-partisan point of view or from an attitude of neutrality as far as the first-order problems of theology are concerned. The questions which I wish to ask are questions in meta-theology. A discussion of these questions can, therefore, be carried on without having to take sides on the question whether a parti cular doctrine or set of doctrines is wholly or partly true or false. I do not wish to claim that a discussion at the meta-theological level will steer clear of all controversies and differences in points of view. But such a discussion, if conducted along the right lines, will not be polemical, since it will not bring into play strong and sharply opposed partisan points of view. By 'the right lines' I mean a discussion in which both parties possess intel A</page><page sequence="2">290 J. N. CHUBB lectual clarity and integrity and are clearly conscious of the issues that are being discussed. A thorough discussion at this level is, I think, extremely important for religious dialogue as a whole. I think that the time is now ripe for recognising that an exchange of ideas at the meta-theological level is a necessary preliminary to a dialogue on religious doctrines and dissensions. If there is a sufficiently long and earnest reflection on meta-theological problems, one beneficial result might be that the non-polemical character of the discussion at the higher order level of reflection may influence men professing different faiths to enter on a dialogue concerning religious doctrines in a much less partisan spirit and with a new open-mindedness about the possibility of reaching, if not a synthesis of divergent points of view, at least a way of understanding and harmonising them in a wider and more charitable outlook than religious discussions have so far revealed. One reason for striking the partisan note springs from the claim to be in exclusive possession of truth or the means of salvation. Consistently with the point of view which I wish to adopt in this paper I shall not discuss the truth or falsity of the claim of the 'exclusivist' in religion. I will here merely advance the suggestion that if in the course of time the claim to be the sole repository of truth and the gateway of salvation is given up-and this, I may add in parenthesis, seems inevitable-and there is a willingness to explore other religions in a proper spirit of respect for discovering their truths and not in the narrowly missionary spirit of exposing errors and heresies, the dialogue at the meta theological level will go a long way in bringing about this, to my mind, very desirable result. The first thing one should recognise about religious dialogue is that if discussions are to be fruitful they cannot be conducted in accordance with a single pattern. There are many patterns of religious dialogue and which pattern is to be followed will depend on the specific issue which is being discussed. The participants must be clear as to the precise nature of the disagreement. Secondly-and the neglect of this condition is likely to turn the discussion into a wrangle or lead to a talking at cross purposes-both parties should be very clear as to the correct method to be followed in arriving at the truth of the matter. There should be an agreement on the answer to the question: what is the correct procedure for arriving at a definite conclusion as to which of the two conflicting doctrines or points of view is true or has greater truth than the other? When two different patterns of dialogue are mixed up or when there is an unnoticed passage from the one to the other the discussion immediately becomes vitiated. One or both parties commits in a subtle manner the fallacy of shifting the ground. Thus if an argument is proceeding along purely rational lines, its course may be suddenly deviated by reference to religious experience or the authority of revelation, and a placid, scholarly discussion is then in danger of being</page><page sequence="3">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 29I converted into an emotionally charged intellectual free-for-all with no holds barred. A religious dialogue must, therefore, constantly keep in mind the following three questions: (I) what is the specific issue that is being discussed? (2) what is the method to be followed for arriving at a satisfactory answer? (3) what is meant by saying that a religious statement or doctrine is 'true'? Without a prior agreement on the answers to these questions, particularly on the answer to the second question, it would be unphilosophical and perhaps irreligious to plunge into an unfruitful discussion. I shall now examine some of the issues that could be raised in a religious dialogue and trace the appropriate patterns of discussion. I shall consider first those issues which represent doctrinal differences and leave open the possibility of reaching at least some measure of agreement through argument. Towards the end I shall consider an approach which recommends the (provisional) bypassing of all doctrinal differences and draws attention to the idea of an ultimate commitment which transcends, without negating, commitment to doctrines, concepts, images, in short to anything which is the mind's formulation of the ultimate. That which is formulated by the mind includes not only that which is reached by the exercise of the natural light of reason but also that which is communicated or revealed by that which is regarded as 'authoritative'. This is the mystical approach which holds that the ultimate object or subject-That or the being to which (or whom) our highest religious aspiration and endeavour is directed-is, in its essence, unknown and unknowable to the mind, that what we have at the level of the intellect is a symbol or reflection but not the body and substance of truth. It is important to emphasise that the mystical allegiance to the un known does not imply the rejection of the mental formulations as false or as having significance only as varying culturally-conditioned interpretations of what is at the top essentially one and the same. We must leave open the possibility that these mental formulations reflect ultimate differences which differentiate, without disrupting, the unity of the infinite being. In this way of treating apparently conflicting reports and revelations of reality or God as 'complementary poises', to use Sri Aurobindo's term, of his being we have both the recognition of the divergences which call for a dialogue and the possibility of effecting a final reconciliation of them. I shall first consider a pattern of dialogue in which the method of resolving the dispute is agreed on by both parties to consist purely in rational argument without an appeal to or reliance on authority of any kind. In religious matters it is extremely difficult to keep the discussion within the bounds of pure ratiocination and one may, after the discussion has gone on for a little while, find it necessary to widen the terms of reference and invoke scripture or inner experience to settle a point or cast the weight of its evidence in favour of one of two contending alternatives. It is true that we cannot</page><page sequence="4">292 J. N. CHUBB determine a priori what course a discussion will or should take. The argument may swing from one course to another. The different lines of approach and strategies employed may be interrelated and provide each other support and it may be artificial to restrict the discussion to a predetermined course. Nevertheless, one can in this many-sided way of tackling a problem dis tinguish different patterns of argument. What can be laid down as a salutary warning is that the transition from one pattern of discussion to another should be clearly recognised, for this is likely to introduce an important change in the accepted method of resolving the dispute. To take one instance, it is obvious that one cannot discuss the truth or otherwise of the doctrine of the uniqueness of the Incarnation in the same way in which one can discuss the validity or otherwise of the ontological argument. Discussion at the intellectual level may to a great extent be fruitful, for a patient probing may reveal that the tension between two doctrines is not really generated at the point where they seem to be most clearly in opposition to each other but at a higher or deeper level. The discussion would then fruitfully move on to the wider context to which one can trace the parting of the ways. To take one example, the doctrine of rebirth seems at first sight to be directly opposed to the view that man's supernatural destiny follows the termination of a single course of life. But must we not dig much deeper to find the roots of the disagreement? It seems to me that these two views are to be understood as consequences of two different ways of con ceiving the relation of the soul to God. It raises much vaster issues and ultimately, I think, the issue whether the world is to be regarded as the manifestation of God which contains in itself as its essence the substance of divinity-the Hindu view, for example-or as a creation ex nihilo and, therefore, in essence void of divinity except what it acquires through relation ship with the creator and the gift of his grace. This would roughly be the Christian view.' If this is true it would not advance the purpose of the dialogue to concentrate too much attention on a consequential doctrine and consider it in isolation from the wider context. When the basic issue has been uncovered the dialogue may proceed with a greater hope of arriving at mutual agreement or at least understanding. Even if final agreement is not reached, tensions can be successively resolved by attempts to comprehend doctrines not in isolation but as fitted into a much wider framework of thought. When at the level of what may be called discursive dialogue two doctrines or points of view appear to collide there are two distinct possibilities that require to be explored. One is the possibility of overcoming the seeming antithesis in a higher synthesis. The other is to recognise that we are up against ultimate incompatibilities and hence, strictly logically, one or both 1 'Ignorance' (Avidya) and 'Sin' would consequently be two ways of accounting for the present 'unregenerate' state of man.</page><page sequence="5">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS D:IALOGUE 293 points of view need to be rejected or substantially modified. These two alternatives will give us two distinct patterns of dialogue. Let us first consider the situation in which the participants agree that there is a logical incompatibility of views. Such a disagreement may arise not necessarily between men belonging to different faiths but also between those belonging in a wide sense to the same religious tradition. Thus, for instance, followers of Sankara and of Ramanuja have been at loggerheads over the question whether the conception of Brahman as the Lord of the universe possessed of all auspicious qualities is or is not ultimate; whether Brahman is 'finally' to be looked upon as saguna (with qualities) or as nirguna (without qualities), as the Supreme Person, Iswara, or as the dif ferenceless and relationless ocean of saccidananda (being-consciousness-bliss). The opposition between the two remains even if Sankara's Advaita is to be understood as stating that 'nirguna' is merely a more adequate pointer to the ineffable than 'sagunan', but in the end, along with the 'saguna' description of Brahman, it has equally to be discarded. Brahman is 'neti, neti', not this, not this. We are here concerned with rival systems of transcendent metaphysics, taken as irreconcilable. How is the argument which is to be purely logically structured to proceed? A deep reflection at the meta-philosophical level combined with the recognition that in the long history of philosophical argumentation logical battles seldom if ever end in victories, particularly where the differences are radical and basic points of view are in confronta tion with each other, might persuade the participants to consider the possibility that both systems may be defended as internally coherent and logically impeccable. The recognition of this possibility would, of course, bring the polemical dispute, and perhaps even the discussion, to an end. This would not be a bad thing if as a matter of fact the discussion was not going along the right lines. I do not here wish to insist that this is the truth of the matter. My purpose in this paper is to delineate patterns of discussion. If there is even a pos sibility that the situation which I have referred to holds, namely, a situation in which rival systems turn out to be logically impeccable, then it is clearly the duty of those who embark on a dialogue to explore this possibility and seriously ask themselves whether in all this hectic slinging of arguments and counter-arguments they may not be talking at cross purposes. This type of reflection may even lead them to question the presupposition of their argument, namely, that these systems are in actual fact incompatible with each other. A good deal of meta-philosophical reflection has convinced me that philosophical reasoning is sui generis and cannot be assimilated to the model of either the inductive or the deductive sciences. Reasoning in philosophy consists, I think, in maturing a point of view which contains a basic concept that functions as a criterion. The 'logic' of a particular system</page><page sequence="6">294 J. N. CHUBB is determined by the basic criterion-concept and is, therefore, internal to it. This explains why those philosophical systems which function as welt angschaaungen have no difficulty in surviving destructive criticism and establishing themselves as internally coherent and logically impeccable. I would like to make it clear that it is not my intention, here at least, to rule out the possibility that an alternative account of the nature of philo sophical reasoning may be given which would lead to a resumption of the dialogue along the old polemical lines. What is necessary, however, is that an attempt should be made to become fully conscious of the presuppositions of the argument before plunging headlong into it. As far as I know no serious thought has been bestowed at the metaphilosophical level on the nature of basic disagreements in philosophy by philosophers who are inclined to be disputatious. It seems to me that many disputes in philosophy have no better foundation than the precedent that such disputes in philosophy have been going on for over 2000 years. I have sugested that metaphilosophical reflection which presents us with a logical impasse caused by two rival systems both claiming logical immunity might incline us to consider more seriously the possibility that the opposition between the systems is only apparent and that a way might be found of reconciling them in a higher synthesis. I shall confine myself only to dis agreements breaking out among rival systems of transcendent metaphysics, for it is here that religious doctrines would present the problem of recon ciliation. If both parties are willing to explore the possibility of overcoming the opposition between such statements as 'God is saguna, or the Supreme Person' and 'God is nirguna, or a differenceless, non-relational being consciousness-bliss' then the pattern of the dialogue once again changes.' The change is radical, for now the two parties, instead of trying to beat each other down or to the second place, engage in a common task of finding out how their differences can be reconciled. In the course of the discussion disagreement may again break out, since there may be more than one way of effecting a reconciliation; but this would be a different type of disagreement, for the two parties would be disagreeing about the correct procedure to be followed for arriving at an agreement with each other. The parties will not agree to differ but differ about how to agree! I shall consider three ways in which a reconciliation of seeming in compatibles may be attempted. One way of doing this is by propounding 1 Differences in views about the nature of the Ultimate are accompanied by corresponding differences in our ways of conceiving the relation of the soul to God. On Sankara's view the Self is identical with Brahman which transcends relations. On any other view that is not strictly non-dualistic the distinction between the soul and God is regarded as ultimate, however close the mode of union between the two. In the former view individuality is transcended; in the latter set of views individtuality is affirmed as real and eternal. A reconciliation of the two views about the nature of God cannot be complete unless there is a corresponding reconciliation of the view that the self ultimately merges in God and the view that affirms that the distinction between the two is ultimate.</page><page sequence="7">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 295 the doctrine of the two truths. According to this way of looking at things, one of the two doctrines gives the full truth, or as full as it is possible for us to achieve, and the other may be accepted as the lesser truth. It is accepted as true in the sense that it is taken to be an approximation to the higher truth and, perhaps, a necessary stage through which we must pass before we can arrive at the final truth. This, it is clear, is not strictly a method of reconciliation because though it does not dismiss the other doctrine as false, yet it relegates it to an inferior position. It is only a half-hearted attempt at reconciliation since each party can claim that the view held by the other is only a stage through which one must or may pass in order to arrive at the plenitude of truth contained in one's own point of view. A vital difference still remains: is personality to be transcended in a being in which all differ ences are swallowed up or is such transcendence only the first touch of reality which comes to fulfilment in the worship of the God of infinite love and wisdom? A more rigorous form of this approach would consist in declaring that the Ultimate is ineffable and hence cannot be described but only somehow indicated. I believe this is Sankara's real position. To say that Brahman is advaita, nirakara (formless) and nirguna is not to describe Brahman or to say that it is such and such; for advaita, nirakara and nirguna are, all of them, negative terms and hence nothing is predicated of Brahman in calling it advaita, etc. To speak of Brahman through the use of negative terms is only a way of indicating that Brahman cannot be described. 'Brahman is nirguna' does not mean 'Brahman is not saguna but something else, i.e. an undifferentiated oneness', for Brahman is not said to be one but advaita, i.e. not two. 'Brahman is nirguna' really means that Brahman cannot be described as saguna, since it cannot be described at all. This is an interesting approach but once again it does not provide the kind of reconciliation we are in search of. It does not affirm the equal truth of seemingly incompatible doctrines but treats all positive affirmations not as containing descriptions but as const.ituting sign posts pointing to the indescribable. The 'truth' of the concept of the Supreme Person, the Purushottamma, is treated as relative and as no more than a means; it is not reaffirmed absolutely as constituting the essence of the ineffable which is beyond thought and speech. I would like to mention in passing that this approach has difficulties of its own. In the first place it is difficult to determine or indicate what is being indicated by our affirmations. The same difficulty is met with in Kant's concept of the thing-in-itself. A great gulf is fixed between reality and concepts which makes it impossible to indicate what we are speaking of when we say that 'it' is beyond thought and speech and cannot in any way be described. Secondly, it is difficult to see in what sense a concept is more or less adequate or more or less true if its truth is not in some clear sense reaffirmed at the absolute level. The</page><page sequence="8">296 J. N. CHUBB truth may be supplemented and transfigured, but it cannot be true in any sense if it is simply rejected. It is not enough to say that the ineffable is the truth of the concept of God as Isvara, the Lord of the universe, for there is no way of distinguishing this statement from the statement that in the ineffable the Isvara-concept is surpassed, by being finally and totally negated. The second method of reconciliation consists in regarding the apparently conflicting doctrines as expressing partial truths and hence as capable of being fitted, after suitable adjustment, into a higher synthesis. But in what sense are the truths to be regarded as 'partial'? If they imply a division in God's being the solution would have to be rejected. God's nature is simple and indivisible. He cannot be partly one thing and partly another. If we say that there are aspects of God's being, each 'aspect' would have to be regarded as one with God's essence which is indivisible. A being whose nature is indivisible does not permit an adjustment of what seem to be incompatible predicates by reference to different 'parts' of its being. This method of reconciliation fails. God cannot be partly personal and partly impersonal. This brings us to the third method of reconciling apparently opposite predicates affirmed of God or the ultimate, a method suggested by Sri Aurobindo, a major motive of whose thought was a steady refusal to rest in any exclusive affirmation and a constant pressure to pass beyond all oppositions to a total integrality of outlook. Indeed so vast and com prehensive is his outlook that one can say of him what Eckhart said of God, that in him there is no denial except the denial of all denials. If the harmony of all religions is regarded as an ideal worth striving for, a harmony in which all doctrines, methods and practices are reconciled and whatever is of positive value in any religion is not merely accorded recognition but shown to have its own individual mode of fulfilment in the whole; if such an ideal is even abstractedly held before the mind as a possibility, then it would be an unpardonable omission on the part of men of different faiths and of good faith not to survey the cosmic grandeur of Sri Aurobindo's integral philosophy in which such an ideal is consciously envisaged and realised. I shall now return to the specific problem of reconciliation, the problem of showing how statements like 'God is personal or with form' and 'God is impersonal or formless' can both be regarded as simultaneously and equally true. Sri Aurobindo has emphasised that the logic that we use in talking about the infinite must be appropriate to its subject matter. It would be an uncritical use of reason to apply the specific logical structure which is valid when thought is concerned with finite and fragmentary modes of existence to the self-existent whose essence is complete and in divisible. To put it briefly, the logic which is appropriate to finite existence is the logic of exclusive affirmation. To affirm a predicate of a finite being</page><page sequence="9">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 297 is necessarily to exclude some other predicate which is the contrary (and not merely the contradictory) of the predicate affirmed. The capacity to accommodate a predicate only through the exclusion of another predicate belonging to the same universe of discourse is the mark of finite existence. The finite lives by exclusion. The infinite, however, suffers from no such limitation. Its acceptance of a predicate is unconditional and does not involve a denial of any predicate except the contradictory of the predicate affirmed. Thus there is no contradiction in saying that God is both personal and impersonal. To say that God is the Supreme Person logically involves the denial of the proposition 'God is not the Supreme Person'. It does not involve the further denial of the proposition 'God is formless and impersonal.' The dialectical battles waged by the holders of these two views is largely the outcome of 'a stumbling round a false sense of contradiction' in which 'concurrent and complementary poises of the infinite' are taken as in compatible and mutually exclusive. 'Our intelligence', says Sri Aurobindo, 'looks at its concept of the Absolute and sees that it must be indeterminable and at the same time it sees a world of determinations which emanates from the Absolute and exists in it . . .; it is further baffled by the affirmation . . . that all these determinates are nothing else than the very indeterminable absolute. But the contradiction disappears when we understand that the indeterminability is not in its own true sense negative, not an imposition of incapacity on the infinite, but positive, a freedom within itself from limitation by its own determinations'.' I have briefly presented Sri Aurobindo's view of the Logic of the infinite as a way of reconciling some of the truth-claims or revelations concerning the nature of God or the ultimate which at first sight seem to be in irre concilable opposition to each other. I believe the view is sound and provides the key to the overcoming of most conflicts in the religious situation. I shall not, however, discuss it at length since my purpose in this paper is to explore the different forms which argument may take in religious dialogue. Sri Aurobindo's conception of the logic of the infinite has undeniable revelance for such dialogue and deserves careful consideration. In terms of it one may achieve a rich synthesis not only of the divergent ways of conceiving the infinite but also of the different paths that lead to it, the path of devotion, love and worship (bhakti yoga), the path of knowledge and mystical con templation (jnadna yoga), and the path of selfless and consecrated action (karma yoga), resulting in different but not exclusive modes of realisation of the soul's relation with God-the blotting out of differences (advaita), intimate union in love (visistadvaita), and companionship and service (dvaita). It could also accommodate the view that Brahman or Nirvana cannot be described (neti neti). The ultimate is ineffable (beyond concep 1 Sri Aurobindo, The Life Divine (Calcutta Arya Publishing House), Vol. II, pp. 46-7.</page><page sequence="10">298 J. N. CHUBB tions). It is ineffable as the impersonal and relationless Ocean of Con sciousness; it is ineffable as the Supreme Person. Besides these two ineffable poises (and it may have many others), Brahman may also have the poise of sheer ineffability, indicated in Sri Ramakrishna's story of the salt doll who went to measure the depth of the ocean. When it plunged in it was dissolved and so could not return to the surface even to declare that the ocean is immeasurable. It is a poise of the infinite from which, as the Taittiriya Upanishad puts it, all speech (including analogical speech) falls back along with the mind, unable to reach it. Brahman, it is said, is nameless. On the basis of the synthesis of the stresses on the personal, the impersonal and the sheerly ineffable, suggested above, the two types of religion, the contemplative and the devotional, could easily be reconciled. Indeed, the fullness of spiritual realisation requires such a synthesis. This union of the contemplative and the devotional approaches to the ineffable Divine, each seeking and finding its culmination in the other, was achieved in the past in the Isa Upanishad and later in the Bhagavad Gita. It is a mistake to label Indian spirituality as exclusively contemplative in character. The strand of devotion has been equally and fully stressed, particularly in Vaisnavism. I shall now consider the distinction between what Professor Zaehner calls the mystical and the prophetic types of religion. It should be noted that the devotional approach is contrasted not with the mystical but with the contemplative approach. The basis of mysticism is the fact that the being and nature of the Ultimate are in a mode which are to us incon ceivable. The contemplative recognises this fact more clearly than the mere devotee. Hence we may say that the contemplative is explicitly and self consciously a mystic. But the practice of the devotee in totally surrendering the individual will to the Divine Will presupposes what the contemplative explicitly recognises. Love of God at its highest differs from all other kinds of love in that it is given to the Supreme Being whose Nature and Will are to us unknown and ineffable. Professor Zaehner attributes certain characteristics to each of the two types of religion he distinguishes. The adherent of the contemplative type ignores the world of time and space and seeks fulfilment in the eternal and the transcendent. 'Prophecy, on the other hand, claims to be a direct communication from a highly personal God who is experienced as an outside power who has a direct message to deliver to a religious community or indeed to all mankind through the prophet in this world of space and time.' Professor Zaehner further suggests that on the whole in mystical religions there is stress on individual salvation, while in prophetic religions ' "salvation" of the community takes precedence over that of the individual'. He calls them 'religions of "solidarity" '. These distinctions appear to me to be rough and ready distinctions. They</page><page sequence="11">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 299 indicate prominent trends which appear in the histories of these types of religion rather than defining and exclusive characteristics. Perhaps Professor Zaehner would also regard them in this light. It is, however, true that the law of human development conforms more or less to the Hegelian dialectic. Tendencies are worked out by being pushed to the extreme and the result is one-sidedness and over-emphasis on a partial truth. Such exclusive affirmations are not only natural but also necessary, for it is only when the tension is at its highest that the need for a synthesis is felt and when it comes it is all the richer for having reconciled elements which were at one time felt to be antithetical. The unity is richly diversified and is not reached either through over-riding differences or through a kind of eclectic patch work. The recognition that human progress is rarely in a straight line but often zigzags upwards through opposites, and its corollary that situations of great tensions contain a nisus towards a greater harmony, provides a clue to a fruitful religious dialogue. Eternity and time, spirit and matter, life-affirmation and life-negation, God as the transcendent beyond manifestation and God as the individual divine playing an effective role in human history-these are pairs of 'opposites' which can in a profounder way of seeing be converted into partial and complementary aspects of an integral truth. How is this to be done? It is not sufficient to talk of God's action in the world or emphasise the ideal of the perfectibility of human society. That which is of permanent value in human life in the world of matter and in human fellowship must be brought into relation with man's ultimate destiny, with the eschaton, the meeting point of time and eternity. If ultimately our salvation or supernatural destiny carries us away into a transcendent Nirvana or some timeless and spaceless Heaven of Bliss, our religion turns out in the end to be life-negating and world-negating. The religion of salvation ends in some form of Mayavada. To talk of univesal salvation (loksangraha) or salvation not from but of the world does not bring us anywhere near the final synthesis. It merely universalises the movement from life in time and the body to a purely spiritual life in the eternal. We are told that Christianity is a historical religion. But what in the end does it make of history? What is the real significance of God's action in the world-a belief which is shared by Hinduism as well? To say that God spoke to the prophets, led the Israelites out of Egypt, chose the Jews and incarnated in Jesus does not provide a genuine alternative to the philosophy of salvation-cum-world-and-life negation. The belief that Christ rose from the dead adds nothing of great significance to the historical aspect of religion, besides being too slender and fragile a foundation to bear the weight of a whole religion. The real sense of God in history is contained only in the possibility of a Divine fulfilment in time, not merely</page><page sequence="12">300 J. N. CHUBB with reference to human history but also with reference to the wider evolutionary process ascending upwards through aeons of time. There have been vague hints and glimpses in the past of the possibility of effecting a final reconciliation of the extreme terms of existence, 'the bridging of the gulf forecast in the mystic parables of the Veda'. Every religion has its eschatology which consists of little more than parables and poetic images and shadowvy intimations of 'some Divine Event to which the whole creation moves'. 'It is a keen sense of this possibility', says Sri Auro bindo, 'which has taken different shapes and persisted through the centuries -the perfectibility of man, the perfectibility of society, the Alwar's vision of the descent of Vishnu and the Gods upon earth, the reign of the saints, sddhundm rajjyam, the city of God, the millenium, the new heaven and earth of the Apocalypse.'" But, as Sri Aurobindo points out, 'these intuitions have lacked a basis of assured knowledge' and as a result the onesidedness of the religious solution is reiterated. The 'bright future hope' is explained or explained away in terms of the old formula-salvation and life eternal. If the Divine denouement is to bring about a genuine salvation of the world, it must be understood, as Sri Aurobindo points out, as an evolutionary pos sibility and more specifically as marking the culmination of the historical process. If it is understood as a kind of divine intervention purely from outside or above the purpose of which is to bring about not a fulfilment of a long process in time but merely the transition from time to eternity, not the crowning act of history but the end of history, not the flowering and overt manifestation of a divine truth concealed at the base of the evolu tionary process but the day of judgment and the catastrophic destruction of the created universe, then the significance of history is lost and the claim that a particular religion is 'historical' becomes an empty claim, for, on this view, God acts in history only in the end to deny history. Christ comes a second time not to fulfil but to destroy. It is in the writings of Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin that one must look for the larger synthesis of the mystical and the prophetic types of religion. In Sri Aurobindo's philosophy the notion of salvation of the spirit by a merging in or union with or a beatific vision of God has to be supplemented by the notion of transformation in which the spirit returns to nature with an as yet unmanifested power of the divine consciousness (the Supermind) and takes up the instruments of the spirit, mind, life and body and liberates them as well from all obscurity, inertia and the drag of the inconscient, thus enabling them to find their own characteristic mode of self-fulfilment. This 'new, liberated, sovereign acceptance of material Nature' will make possible a divine Life on earth in a transformed and luminous body and this will be the culmination of the divine intention secret in the heart of the evolutionary process, the denouement of God's 1 Sri Aurobindo, The Life Divine (Calcutta Arya Publishing House), Vol. II, p. 232.</page><page sequence="13">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 30I purpose working in the world and his continual action and occasional intervention in time and history. This fulfilment, though not the termination of history and life on earth, will mark the end of one phase of evolution, what Sri Aurobindo has called 'the Evolution in the Ignorance' and the beginning of a new phase-'Evolution in the Knowledge'-which will be an endless progression of self-enrichment in the infinite on the basis of an inner freedom and bliss. The purpose of religious dialogue is not merely to achieve mutual under standing and the largest possible measure of agreement; it can also be undertaken to assist in a deeper reflection on the views one holds and to arrive at a more adequate and convincing formulation of them. It will be generally agreed that the eschatologies of different religions have been propounded as more or less speculative and hasty postscripts leaving many important questions unanswered. To formulate a systematic and com prehensive eschatology one cannot do better than to give very serious consideration to Teilhard de Chardin's conception of cosmic evolution reaching the terminal phase of convergent evolution in the Omega Point, and to Sri Aurobindo's revelation of the Supermind or the Truth-Con sciousness and the emergence of A Divine Life on earth as the next stage of the evolutionary process. So far I have considered types of dialogue in connection with doctrinal differences which set up real or apparent conflicting truth-claims. The reconciliation (if that is the object of the dialogue) is effected by questioning certain presuppositions which make it appear that the divergent truth claims are logically incompatible. There is, however, the possibility of a rapprochement and a deeper unity of approach at an altogether different level. At this level doctrinal differences cease to be of primary importance and the essence of religion is sought in an approach or commitment that cuts across all doctrinal differences. It is the commitment to the Supreme Mystery which transcends doctrine without negating it, and the approach to It (I use the neuter 'It' not descriptively but as a strictly 'neutral' term), if it can be called an 'approach',' is along the via negativa. This is the religion of the mystic who suspends or brackets all preconceptions and affirmations because he feels a pull towards that which is the unknown, the ineffable and the wholly new. Before developing further the idea that the mystical approach brings about a unity above the level of concepts and doctrines we may consider here the possibility of a dialogue arising out of the question of the place and importance of mysticism in religion. Mysticism could be regarded as the highest religion (as it would be by the mystics themselves) or it could be put in its place as only one type of religion or it could be relegated to an inferior position or even looked upon with suspicion and disfavour. What 1 It is called 'the pathless path' and the Buddha is referred to as 'the Pathless One'.</page><page sequence="14">302 J. N. CHUBB is the issue here that requires to be discussed? What is the criterion to be adopted for establishing a hierarchy and regarding something as a higher type of religion or even as the culmination of all religions? I shall try to disentangle one or two of the issues that may arise in a dialogue on the truth and importance of the mystical approach. One question we may be concerned with is, how shall we arrive at a satisfactory definition of religion? There are a great many religions and a wide variety of beliefs, attitudes and practices which are called religious. Are we to seek for the 'essence' of religion in a common core or the least common denominator and having defined the 'generic' nature of religion treat the different religions as different species of the same genus? If this approach is adopted it would become clear that mysticism (or, indeed, any other type of religion) could not be regarded as in any way central or of the 'essence' of religion, for it is not the common core of all religions. This scientific or inductive method of determining what religion is, is I think basically mistaken. In studying a phenomenon which is capable of growth and which exists in different stages and exhibits different degrees of perfection or approximation to an ideal, what we must look for is not a common core which would be so abstract and poor in content as to be worth nothing, but what Aristotle would call its 'form' which is pressing upwards through layers of 'matter' and exhibiting itself more and more fully in the process. Such a process has to be explained and defined in terms of the end, as what the earlier modes or stages were struggling to become and not in terms of an inviolable core hopping along from stage to stage. This leaves open the possibility of placing mysticism at the summit of religious experience, of regarding it as the highest form of religion and all other religions as approximating to it in varying degrees or as preparations for it. The next question would be, Is there any justification for exalting mysticism above all other forms of religious life? In accordance with the plan of this paper I shall here merely indicate the issue that is involved in dis cussing this question. The validity of the mystical claim-that all religious paths lead in the end to mysticism-rests on a certain conception of the ultimate which may not be shared by all men of faith. It is that the existence and nature of God are in a mode which are to us inconceivable, and that, therefore, our ways of talking about God can, at best, be in some way analogical. God, according to this way of thinking, is not a being who is merely superior to us, but a being of a different kind. His love (if God is Love) is not merely infinitely greater than human love in degree but Love of a different kind. God is unique and God alone is absolutely unique in every conceivable way. In short God is mystery, tremendum, if you like, if tremendum means awe-inspiring, but not necessarily tremendum in the sense of creating fear; but certainly fascinans. The characteristic of mystery is</page><page sequence="15">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 303 that it is the wholly other, not in the sense that there is an impassable gulf between mystery and ourselves-for then it would mean nothing to us-but in the sense that it is wholly new in which all things are made new. If our deepest religious aspiration brings us into the presence of mystery which is above the level of concepts we are left with two alternatives agnosticism or mysticism. There can be no knowledge of mystery if know ledge is speculative and provides us merely with a conceptual scheme. It is not merely that we do not have an adequate knowledge of mystery, for this is true of our knowledge of finite things as well. We do not know anything with complete adequacy. If we are to talk of 'inadequacy' in our intellectual approach to mystery it is an inadequacy which points to a different dimen sion of being and knowledge, and our conceptual scheme is inadequate not mainly because it is partial but because it is provisional and points beyond itself to the wholly other. Our concepts represent or symbolise mystery by reflecting it in the mirror of the intellect more or less adequately; but this whole realm of representation is inadequate in a different sense, in that it merely prefigures as if in a glass darkly wlhat is yet to be known beyond the level of concepts and what, in its essence, cannot be known at all by means of concepts. The intellect translates mystery into a set of symbols but the mystery cannot be penetrated till the symbols are realised in a direct and supra-rational experience. This, I take it, is the contention of all the great mystics in all the different religious traditions. Those who do not agree that God is mystery in the sense explained above would be required to show how their view of God escapes the charge of being anthropomorphic. It is difficult to see how tlle object of our worship can be looked upon simply as a superior type of being. To say that God is the highest being does not bring out the idea of God as the perfect being, if the difference between God and man is understood in terms of degree and not as an absolute difference of kind. To say that God is the highest being would amount to no more than stating a contingent fact that among all beings God is, as a matter of fact, unsurpassed. Such a being could command respect but could not demand from us worship and total surrender. The alternative to this would appear to be worship of the unknown God. But God as mystery is unknown only in the sense that it cannot be directly grasped at the level of concepts. It is ineffable, beyond thought and speech and wholly new. The mystery, however, is not unknowable; it can be penetrated by rising above the level of concepts. This is where mysticism offers a genuine and, if our concept of God is not anthropomorphic, the only alternative to agnosticism. The mystical approach rests on the recognition that mystery cannot be directly grasped through concepts, by an action of the mind or through any thing that we can do. Mystery discloses itself to us in the total silence of our being. Silence, the passage through the dark night of the spirit and the</page><page sequence="16">304 J. N. CHUBB cloud of unknowing regenerates the being. The new can only be known by that which is made new. The self discovers itself as the eternal spirit seated in the very heart of the eternal mystery. It is not difficult to see how the mystical approach brings about unity by cutting across all doctrinal differences. The mystical commitment is not to any doctrine, belief or concept but to the unknown. Silence and the withdrawal from all concepts, images and affirmations is imperative if the unknown is to disclose itself. The mystics, therefore, are not divided by conceptual schemes, traditions and other cultural factors. They are united in a common commitment. What they share is not a doctrine but a kind of inchoate expectancy, a dim and unformulated awareness of 'the Marvellous and Ineffable Absolute', of a God who is nameless. It should be noted that mysticism does not forge a unity by cancelling all differences. The unity that is here achieved is the unity of approach, the via negativa. This does not necessarily imply a uniformity in the self-disclosure of the infinite. Mystical experiences can and do vary in content. This is because the via negativa is not a denial of the truth of doctrines and concepts. It consists in 'bracketing' them provisionally since they are merely transla tions of the real in a lower medium and cannot present the real in its essence. The absolute truth of what is bracketed is discovered above the level of concepts and is reaffirmed. Thus doctrinal differences which were tem porarily shelved are reinstated. God is declared by one mystic to be a differenceless and relationless consciousness-bliss and by another to be the Supreme Lord of Love and Infinite Graciousness. It is, I think, a shallow view which tries to explain away these differences in the self-disclosure of the infinite by reference to the convenient distinction between experience and interpretation. It is suggested that all mystical experience is one and the same and that this experience is strictly in describable. It is when the mystic attempts to report what he has experienced that he introduces an element of interpretation in terms of a pre-existent framework of thought dependent upon the tradition and culture in which the mystic was reared. This seems to me to be simply false. In the first place the mystic experience is not of something filtering through a layer of concepts and images, for these have consciously been set aside as hindrances to the passive reception and self-disclosure of the mystery. The experience is supra-rational; it transcends all cultures and traditions and is self-existent. Secondly, the mystic himself claims not to interpret but to 'read off' and communicate to others, as far as this is possible, a truth contained in a direct and self-authenticating experience. Varieties of mystical experience find a more natural and satisfactory explana tion in the recognition that the infinite, though indivisible, is rich and many sided; though one, it is a self-differentiated unity. The mystics, therefore, reveal different aspects or poises of one and the same truth. These different</page><page sequence="17">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 305 'revelations' are in apparent conflict but we have already discussed the possibility of reconciling the seemingly incompatible affirmations in terms of Sri Aurobindo's conception of the logic of the infinite. 'The Absolute', says Sri Aurobindo, 'is not a sceptical logician denying the truth of his own statements and self-expressions, but an existence so utterly and so infinitely positive that no finite positive can be formulated which can exhaust it or bind it down to its definitions'.' Lastly, in the mystical approach we have a further significant contribution to religious dialogue in so far as this dialogue operates with the notion of 'truth'. One may raise the question, how is the truth of religious belief to be established? This question need not be considered here as it arises in a dialogue between the believer and the unbeliever. Our concern is with the different patterns of dialogue that arise given the validity of religious belief. The two questions that need to be considered are (a) what is the criterion or what are the criteria of truth that should be used to adjudicate between conflicting religious truth-claims? and (b) what is really meant by saying that a religious belief is true ? In this paper I have suggested that one way of settling a conflict between truth-claims is by showing that the conflict is only apparent, and this, it was suggested, can be done by recognising that certain logical presupposi tions which are valid when thought is concerned with finite and transient things (e.g. the presupposition that every assertion implies a significant or non-formal denial) are no longer applicable when our thought is directed to a Reality in which there is no denial, except the denial of all denial. But this way of overcoming prima facie incompatibilities may not work in the case of all differences in points of view. I have in mind the two contrasting weltangshaaungen or cosmologies which I mentioned earlier, the Hindu and the Christian views of the relation of the universe to God. Certain con sequences can be drawn from these views which one would be inclined to think are not only apparently but actually incompatible with each other. On the one hand (the Hindu view), the soul of man is to be regarded as uncreated, eternal, a portion of Brahman or even identical with it in essence; on the other hand we have the Christian view according to which the soul of man is created and is thus essentially a creature in time, though it may be lifted out of time into life eternal by the grace of God. Further, on this view, though man is made in the image of God he does not possess divinity as his essence or in his own right. As a created being he is strictly other than, though dependent upon, his creator. Many think further that man is born in sin. His nature is corruptible and can only be redeemed by an act of grace. On the Hindu view the soul of man is essentially incorruptible, stainless (niranjana) and hence the notion of 'sin' is totally inapplicable to it. Lastly, in spite of the insistence on the importance of grace the Christian 1 Sri Aurobindo, The Life Divine (Calcutta Arya Publishing House), Vol. II, pp. 103-4.</page><page sequence="18">306 J. N. CHUBB view of salvation and damnation appears to work within the framework of a strictly moral point of view and not a particularly exalted one at that. It appears to set up the law of reward and punishment as expressive of divine justice or adopts the notion of predestination which avoids the crudity of the moral outlook but makes it difficult for us to believe in a God who loves all his creatures. Some Christian theologians hold the view that all creatures will in the end be 'saved'. This presumably involves the notion of purgatory as an intermediate state in which progress can be made towards the good life. But here too, in the end, salvation comes as a fitting reward for an approved mode of life. It is not surprising that an eschatology which regards heaven as a just recompense for a life of virtue should have no use for the theory of re incarnation. The idea of purgatory as a post-mortem field of progress is a partial approximation to the theory of reincarnation though there is an important difference which is a consequence of the difference in the con ception of the self. If the self is in reality eternal and perfect, its personality is not the truth about himself. It is only a 'mask' or a temporary formation with which the self identifies itself. Hence the theory of reincarnation implies a succession of personalities and not the development of a single personality, which is perhaps all that the Christian view could allow for. Hence, strictly speaking, a view that regards the soul as created (ex nihilo) can only grant to such a soul one life even if the life is prolonged after death and continues to unfold and develop in the intermediate stage. To return to the main question: What kind of dialogue can take place between the holders of these two contrasting world views and what is the relevance of the appeal to mystical experience? Are the differences between the two views differences regarding matters of fact or merely differences in the understanding and interpretation of certain key concepts? I think both kinds of differences are involved here. Both sides have a great deal of explaining to do in order to present their respective theories in a more convincing manner. This might bring about a convergence of the two notions of creation and manifestation, particularly if creation 'out of nothing' is interpreted to mean no more than a denial of a pre-existent material cause. To take another example, Christianity has to give a more coherent account of the notion of salvation reconciling the view of salvation as following on a certain mode of life in this world (the 'reward' theory) and the doctrine of grace. I cannot see how this can be done within the framework of Christian thought. Salvation is the result of Grace and salvation is contingent. The soul has to be saved; salvation is something to be attained; whereas on the Hindu view the soul does not have to attain freedom, for it is eternally free. The difficulty in the Christian view is how to reconcile grace with salvation which is something to be attained and is, therefore, contingent on something. On what? Grace that is merited is not grace, not a free gift</page><page sequence="19">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 307 of God, but grace that is unmerited is arbitrary. Does salvation then depend on God's arbitrary choice? Or should we say that grace cannot be brought into a causal relation with human activity? But this view implies that salvation or freedom is not contingent and hence not contingent on anything that we do or fail to do. The only alternative then is that salvation is the very nature of the eternal self. I have here gone beyond the terms of reference laid down for this paper and have taken sides in a dialogue or at least shown where my sympathies lie. I do not, however, wish to suggest that the Christian theologian would not have an answer to the objections which I have raised. These objections could be regarded as specifying the kind of dialogue that could take place between the Christian and the Hindu. This type of dialogue would consist largely in the clarification of concepts and achieving a deeper or less simple minded understanding and perhaps modification of views already held. One may in this way perhaps smooth out the differences between the notions of creation and manifestation, sin and ignorance as the original cause of man's present 'unregenerate' state. But I believe that the difference of view-points here is such that the dialogue could not proceed very far without coming up against incompatible assertions concerning a matter of fact. On the Hindu view the soul is uncreated and an eternal portion of, if not identical with, the Eternal Being. It is doubtful if any interpretation of the Christian view, however refined and sophisticated, could result in the soul being regarded as in essence eternal. I would here urge two points for the con sideration of the Christian thinker; the first raises a purely logical con sideration and the second appeals to the evidence of mystical experience. The Christian view is that by the grace of God the human soul is lifted up into life eternal. Is this possible? Of course all things are possible to God except logical impossibilities. But is not the notion of 'becoming eternal' logically incoherent? We must distinguish the eternal from the sempiternal. A being who is semnpiternal is one who lives or will live for ever in time. We can say of him that at any time he will be alive. But a being who is eternal is one who transcends time. If we speak of him in terms of time we can say that he will live for ever. But this is to express in an inadequate way the truth about the timelessness of his being. Concerning a being who is in time it is logically conceivable that he may cease to exist. If a being is timeless (eternal) it is logically inconceivable that he will cease to exist. If the Christian view simply is that by the grace of God the human soul or some human souls will live for ever, it will not run into any logical difficulties; but if it is claimed that the saved soul will come to participate in the eternal being of God, we are confronted with the paradox that that which is in time becomes that which is timeless, i.e. that which transcends time and, therefore, never was in time. There is no temporal passage from time to the timeless.</page><page sequence="20">308 J. N. CHUBB Secondly, the mystical experience may be not inadequately described as the realisation that one is eternal in the sense of being beyond time and, therefore, uncreated. If the mystic were to speak of his self in the language of time he would say, 'I have always existed and shall always exist; at no time was I not.' The self that is thus spoken of is the pure consciousness (Atman) discovered to be one with Brahman (or one poise of Brahman, as Sri Aurobindo would say), or the eternal individual who is seen as a power or portion of the universal self. It seems to me that the evidence of mystic experience which confirms the Hindu view as against the Christian view can be ignored only if one rejects the claim of mysticism to give direct, supra-relational knowledge of the ultimate. This brings me to the last question: What is the concept of truth or what does the term 'truth' signify when we talk of religious truth and the conflict or reconciliation of the truth-claims made by different religions? There is a polarity in the concept of truth itself which requires to be understood. On the one hand there is the intellectualist's conception of truth as something static, eternal and objective, i.e. as something which is simply there whether any one takes note of it or not; on the other hand we have the existentialist's conception of truth which makes it something much more personal, something which is to be found not in statements and concepts but in will, intention and desire. A discussion of a problem concerning religious truth-claims carried on by two persons holding these two different views of the nature of truth would result in a fruitless talking at cross purposes. The proper question to discuss would be whether these two views of truth are really opposed or whether they can be reconciled. These two views need to be reconciled since if the objectivity of truth is rejected, religious life would become blind and if the personalistic aspect is ignored religious life would become empty. It is, I think, natural to regard these two views of the meaning of 'truth' as not opposed but in some way complementary. 'Truth' stands for a relationship between the mind and reality. It is an aspect under which the real enters into relation with us. It is, therefore, essentially bi-polar, pointing at one end to the Object-which makes truth objective-and at the other end to the subject-which makes truth subjective in the sense of coming to fulfilment in the subject. Each is incomplete without the others. 'Truth' is an abstraction until it is lived, until it becomes true to us and in us; yet it is the truth that is to be lived, for a mode of living does not guarantee its own truth but refers to a standard beyond itself. Evil, falsehood and fanaticism can also be lived as intensely and thoroughly as truth. To show that 'truth' is bi-polar is to effect a partial reconciliation of the tension between the objectivistic and the personalistic account of truth, subject and object are brought into a unity, but since reference is made to a 'standard', the former still falls short of the latter. This does not mean that</page><page sequence="21">PRESUPPOSITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE 309 the standard is an external one applied to the subjective experience from outside, for the standard is supplied by thought, and thinking is an integral part of the subject's experience. At the same time the application of a stan dard, even though internal to thought fails to bring about a coincidence of truth as something objective and truth, as made real in our lives. This is because thought always points beyond itself to an object which it cannot assimilate. What is known by thinking always stands over and against thought as its other. Thinking about that which transcends our sense experience is speculation which at best gives us a reflection of the real but does not bring us into the direct presence of the reality reflected. This is true even when what is known is something that is 'revealed', for in grasping the content of revelation thought converts it into a reflection of the real. In the Indian tradition a clear distinction is made between the 'hearing' of the truth (sravana) and its realisation (sakshatkar). What is heard is first translated into an object of thought. It is understood as what is 'to be realised' beyond the level of thought. The objectivistic and the personalistic aspects of truth meet, coincide and find their fulfilment in mystical experience in which the nisus inherent in thought towards an Object beyond itself is overcome. Though not necessarily complete and integral, mystical experience is, as far as it goes, self-contained and self-authenticating. The objective and eternal truths of religion can become dynamic in two dimensions-horizontally, when they are given practical application and become the central moulding influences of our lives, and vertically, when the truths which reflect the, in essence, incon ceivable being and nature of God are realised beyond the level of concepts. In being 'realised' religious truths are fulfilled and, as such, transcended because the real is no longer present by proxy, under the aspect or figure of truth, but substantially and in itself. I have said that mystical experiences can be partial (most if not all mystical experiences are partial) and self-authenticating. Though the knowledge it gives is direct and supra-rational, the mystical experience may be partial since it is of an integral and many-sided reality which need not disclose itself to the mystic in its integrality. Metaphysical systems appear to be in conflict with each other, e.g. advaita, visistddvaita and dvaita, because they are erected on partial realisations each of which is mistakenly taken for the whole. All systems of transcendent metaphysics can be reconciled if it is understood that the self-disclosure of the infinite beyond the level of concepts is not necessarily its self-disclosure in all its aspects or poises. Even when partial, mystical experience is self-authenticating, since it is direct and supra-rational. It would be a mistake to assume that if an experience is self-authenticating its claim to be valid must be logically demonstrable. The self-evident is not necessarily that which cannot be denied without self-contradiction. That which is supra-rational can be self-authen</page><page sequence="22">3IO J. N. CHUBB ticating without depending on a rational demonstration. The validity of mystical experience can be questionedfrom without and the doubt cannot be shown to be logically absurd. WIVithin the mystical experience doubt does not and cannot arise. What is meant by calling mystical experience self authenticating is that it needs to rely on no standard of truth which carries the seer beyond the experience itself. At the rational or pre-mystical level the intellect knows the real under the aspect of truth, but also, and neces sarily, sets up the real as an other to itself. In intellectual truth there is a tension and nisus which, at this level, cannot be overcome. The gap which creates the nisus is bridged in the higher unitive knowledge or knowledge by identity. Reality enters the sphere of concepts and becomes 'truth' so that truth may become real or be realised beyond all conceptualisation. This dynamic process of realising truth or bringing about a coincidence of truth and reality gives the fiullest significance to the concept of religious truth and reconciles its objective and eternal aspect with the demand for its existential fulfilment. This is the mystic's contribution to the dialogue concerning the concept of religious truth. The testimony of the mystic may not be accepted but it cannot be ignored. He alone among us appears to speak 'as one possessing authority'. If the rational form which he gives to his experience is coherent and accords full consideration to all that is implied in the concept of truth, on what grounds can his authority or the authenticity of his experience be questioned? I, for one, do not question it and I confess I do not see how it could conceivably be called in question. But let the dialogue continue.</page></plain_text>
