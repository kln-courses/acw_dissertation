The oft-repeated saying that "the ancients have stolen our thunder" could with all aptness be applied to Origen. The particular thunder with which we are here concerned is that of the modern historical method in Biblical study, or the higher cri- ticism. It was logical enough that whatever liberal tendencies were to make themselves felt in early Christianity would issue from cosmopolitan Alexandria, where all the cross-currents of thought mingled, and where Jews, Christians, and heathen listened to the same teachers and were tolerant of each other. Intellectual freedom flourishes in a syncretistic environment. The soil having been prepared by Philo, it was Origen's purpose to sow the seed of Hellenism on a Jewish field, to make a philo- sophic statement of Christianity that would counteract Gnosticism and also harmonize the apostolic tradition with Judaic-Greek philosophy. Origen, following in the steps of Clement, his teacher, recognized the necessity of finding a philosophy for Christianity that would meet the intellectual demands of that day, a theology that would ally itself with Greek culture and the scientific spirit. Tertullian, on the other hand, stoutly opposed philosophical and cultural development. Clement meant to endow Christianity with the spirit of Plato; he saw in the Greek philosophy a preparation for the Gospel similar to that of the law for the Jews; he wanted to apply the scientific spirit of analysis to religion. Origen went still farther in his advocacy of reason, tolerance, and cultural</page><page sequence="2">BRATTON: PRECURSORS OF BIBLICAL CRITICISM 177 adjustment. "I1 est encore un vrai fils de la Grace. II a leur curio- sit6 d'esprit. Comme eux, il prouve un besoin irr'sistable de poser des questions."' But Origen's seed fell on stony ground. He himself was driven from his own land by mob violence, was condemned by the church, was tortured and imprisoned, and finally died as a heretic, broken in spirit and body. It might truly be said that if one searched the archives of history and chose the names of those who had been excommunicated, condemned, or crucified, he would have a fairly complete history of truth, or the progressive advance toward truth. Every age rejects its greatest teacher; he is not for his own age, but for the future. That is the prophetic price. In rejecting Origen, Christianity turned its back on tolerance, culture, and rational religion and embraced dogmatism, legalism, and magic. What Christianity really did was to borrow from Hellenism the less important trappings of sacramentalism and reject the more im- portant enlightenment. It forsook the greatest teacher of early Christianity, whose faith was sane and wholesome, and construct- ed its theology along Augustinian lines, which led immediately to unwholesomeness and blind credulity. It preferred Tertullian's delight in the torture of the damned to the universalistic faith of Origen. It adopted Cyprian's dictum that without the church there is no salvation rather than Origen's faith that all pre-Christian souls who loved God were redeemed. The victory of Africanism over the Greek spirit was deplored by Bishop Westcott. "By his (Origen's) sympathy with all effort, by his largeness of view, by his combination of a noble morality with a deep mysticism, he indicates, if he does not bring, the true remedy for the evils of that Africanism which has been dominant in Europe since the time of Augustine. ... Over the questions with which we have now to deal, Augustine can no longer hold dominion, and the shadow of his power is perilous to the growth of truth."2 This is echoed by one of the keenest and boldest minds of our own day. "Had Origen secured a hearing or had successors to him arisen, the Church's 1 de Faye: Origene, 1, p. 220. 2 Hiatory of Religious Thought in the West, pp. 246, 250.</page><page sequence="3">178 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE victory over Gnosticism would have proved less perilous and would have issued in a liberalizing and expansive tendency rather than in a narrowing and codifying process with anathemas of excommunication."3 The rejection of Origen by the early church proves his modernity. (In fact, he would not be altogether popular in many quarters now!) Faithful follower of Plato that he was, he defined God as "Spirit" and "Light," "the source of all mind."4 He steers clear of pantheism with the statement that God is spaceless and time- less. God is merciful and does not punish; punishment rather is a consequence of sin and is self-inflicted. God is self-limited by virtue of his own love and wisdom. This sounds like the nineteenth century reaction to Calvinism. Our interest, however, is in the Biblical rather than the theolo- gical field. Here, it must be conceded, Origen was a man of his own age in respect to his allegorical interpretation. But his use of alle- gory, as Dean Inge says, was not only "an instrument of apolo- getics" but "at the same time a device to gain freedom of thought." Even so, his interpretation was more scientific than post-Refor- mation literalism, for often he refuses to admit the literal validity of Scripture. "What man of sense will suppose that the first and second and third day, and the evening and morning existed without sun, moon, and stars ? Or that God walked in a garden in the eve- ning, and that Adam hid himself under a tree ? Or that the devil took Jesus into a high mountain, whence he could see the kingdoms of the Persians and Scythians and Indians ?,"5 In the same work he writes: "There are some passages which are not literally true, but absurd and impossible."6 Regarding some of the so-called laws of Moses, he comments: "I should blush to admit that God has given such commands which are inferior to many human enactments." He revolted against the anthropomorphism of the Old Testament and referred to such stories as Moses' seeing God 3 S. Angus: The Religious Quest8 of the Graeco-Roman World, p. 413.

He designated as immoral and unfit to read such material as Lot's intercourse with his daughters, Abra- ham and his licentious conduct, and Jacob's amours.8 He regarded as barbarous the command in Gen. 17 14 to kill uncircumcised children. His treatment of the New Testament from the critical standpoint is remarkably advanced, for he calls attention to various discrepancies and contradictions in the Gospels.9 Origen was one of the first to escape from the Jewish and Zoroastrian eschatology, and for him, as for Paul, immortality was a spiritual continuity and not a resurrection of the body.1' His eschatology was at variance with the current thought on judgment, heaven, and hell. With him the death of Christ was not a substitutionary atonement. The modern relegation of miracle to a secondary and non-important role was anticipated by this great third century teacher. "Even were I going to admit that a demon named Aesculapius had the power of healing bodily diseases, I might still remark to those who are amazed at such cures or at the prophecies of Apollo, that such curative power is of itself neither good nor bad, but within reach of godless as well as of honest folk; while in the same way, it does not follow that he who can foretell the future is on that account an honest and upright man... The power of healing diseases is not evidence of anything specially divine."'1 It is true that Origen, being a child of his own age, believed in exorcism and demons; he resorted to allegory for his interpretation -a method which we today have thrown overboard along with Calvin's literalism and the nineteenth century method of rationali- zation;12 he inflicted upon himself a severe asceticism; but in spite of these things, his differentiation from his age predominates over ' Ibid., II, 4, 3. s Ibid., IV, 1, 9. 9 Commentary on John, X, 2-3; De Prin., IV, 1, 18. 10 Contra Celsutn, VI, 29.

If the modern spirit means a re-setting or re- thinking of religion for a given age-meeting the best intellectual demands of that age-then Origen had a goodly share of that spirit, and we are his heirs and debtors. As Dr. R. J. H. Gottheil pointed out in a paper delivered in 1904 before the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, Ibn Ezra and Spinoza were merely carrying out the tradition found even as far back as the Talmudists, who called attention to scores of discrepancies and contradictions in the Old Testament. It was observed by one that the flood was not a world catastrophe but local in character, by another that Moses and Elijah did not ascend to heaven, and by a third that the birds which fed Elijah were human. Then, in the ninth century there was Hivi. His critical attitude was due probably to the Zoroastrian anti-Biblical teaching to which he had been exposed and from which he had undoubtedly learned. He gathered together Biblical difficulties which were rationalized by earlier Talmudists, such as the discrepancy be- tween 2 Kgs. 8 26 where Ahaziah's reign is assigned to his twenty- second year and 2 Chron. 22 2 where it is his forty-second. He anticipates the rationalistic exegesis in his theory that the cross- ing of the Red Sea was made at low tide, and that the paleness of Moses' face (Ex. 34 29) was due to a long period of fasting on the mountain. There was the unknown skeptic of the eleventh century whose Biblical critism is described by Professor Schechter.'3 In the few extant pages of the manuscript the author scans the entire Old Testament and points out every possible discrepancy and contra- diction. The work was written in a symbolic acrostic style. His questions range from chronological data to the theological impli- cations of the Bible. He finds it impossible to believe in the justice of God from his reading of the patriarchal narratives. His criticism seems to be aimed at all official tradition and he makes a strong plea for independent study. It was such critical voices as that of the unknown skeptic that find echoes in the celebrated works of 13 Jewish Quarterly Review, Vol. XIII, pp. 345ff.</page><page sequence="6">BRATTON: PRECURSORS OF BIBLIOAL CRITICISM 181 the two Jewish scholars who occupy our attention in the remainder of this paper. II. Abraham ben Ezra. Long before the Renaissance had shaken Europe out of its medieval sleep, in the "Golden Age of Spain," when the only ones who kept the torch of truth and learning from dying out in the dark night of ignorance and bloodshed were the Jews, one Abraham ben Ezra wandered over Europe, rekindling the fires of critical inquiry left smouldering since Origen. This fascinating figure-theologian, philosopher, poet, mathematician, astrologer, and Biblical commentator-was the inspiration of Browning's masterpiece, Rabbi Ben Ezra. Perhaps the poet saw in the wandering Jew an illustration of his own philosophy of struggle, optimism, and persistance. At any rate, the poem could well be called The Jewish Spirit. The revolt of Karaism against the Talmudic domination and the Arabic development of Saadya, which followed on its heels, may have prepared the way for the work of Ibn Ezra, which really marks a second mile stone in the history of Biblical Science. In his commentary on the Pentateuch, Ibn Ezra rejects allegorism along with Midrashic interpretation in favor of his own historical and common-sense method. Of verbal inspiration he will have none. The miraculous plays no significant role with him. He could not believe that Biblical authors anticipated history. Commenting on Gen. 12 6 ("and the Canaanite was then in the land"), Ibn Ezra wrote: "There is in this a mystery and let him that comprehendeth be silent." It must have been clear to him from the retrospective language used that Moses did not write Genesis, for the passage in question implies that the Canaanites long since had been driven from Palestine, a procedure which continued down to the monarchy. Ibn Ezra was one of the first to detect a second authorship in Isaiah, a hand that was undoubtedly post-Exilic, for the references to Cyrus as the great deliverer of the Jews could hardly have been written by the eighth century Isaiah. He ventured the suggestion that the latter part of 2. Samuel was of different authorship from the first part. Finally, and most important of all, he questioned the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. 13</page><page sequence="7">182 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE In spite of the spread of Jewish learning in Spain, the age was not really conducive to a critical attitude toward the Scriptures, so that Ibn Ezra discreetly veiled his statements in ambiguous and figurative phraseology. His masterly knowledge of Hebrew enabled him in his commentary to clarify many obscure passages and render the original text more accurately. Like Origen, of course, Ibn Ezra was a child of his age, and whereas in the former case it was allegory, in this it was astrology that labeled him as part of the mentality of the time. He was not complete, consistent, unified. He lacked balance and concentration. But it will always be to the credit of this genius that he was greatly instrumental in spreading Arabic and Jewish learning when learning was scarce, and was the interlude or connecting link between the ancient and modern world of Biblical scholarship. III. Spinoza. The torch of truth and learning again flamed in the seventeenth century and this time more brightly and evenly than ever and in the hands of Baruch Spinoza lighted the way to the modern era. Fearless and unprejudiced and possessing a mind that was at once mathematical and philosophical, he cleared away the old structure of allegory, Kabbala, and literalism, and then proceeded to lay a new foundation called the Tractatus Theologico- Politicus, which is the Magna Charta of Biblical Criticism. His contribution to Biblical Science lies in his anticipation of the two successive stages through which we of the present age have just passed: Rationalism, or the harmonizing of Scripture with natural law, and Historical Criticism, which assigns Scripture to its age and setting and does not try to "save" its contents. With us today, of course, the former method is just as useless as allegory, but it was significant that one in the seventeenth century should make use of the first and at least point the way to the other. The defect of the rationalistic method is that Scripture is assumed a priori to be truth, that the world of nature is also truth, and that the latter really determines the meaning of the former.'4 On this prin- ciple certain teachers even today reconcile the Red Sea story (and many similar legends) with some unusual but "altogether possible" 14 See Martineau: Study of Spinoza, p. 354.</page><page sequence="8">BRATTON: PRECURSORS OF BIBLICAL CRITICISM 183 natural law. Spinoza, however, did not abuse the rationalistic method. He insists on the right to refute Scripture which is con- trary to nature just as he would the Talmud or the Koran.'5 Spinoza's scientific attitude is seen to better advantage in his literary criticism of the Pentateuch and here he is the acknowledged debtor to Ibn Ezra. Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch is rejected first of all on the basis of anachronisms, e. g., the mention of the iron bedstead of Og, king of Bashan (conquered by David; see 2 Sam. 12 29, 30o). Then, he notices retrospective allusions in the Pentateuch to sources later than Moses, e. g., Num. 21 14.16 Further, the non-Mosaic authorship is evident in the assignment to Moses' hand material that with certainty must be dated as late as the Exile. He points out that the Pentateuch must be seen along with Joshua and Judges as the work of editors, culminating with Ezra. It was noticed that the Pentateuch was made up of distinct strands or documents which were later edited, and the evidence of compilation and editorial correction was easily observed.17 Spinoza's criticism places Nehemiah as late as the second century B.C. and the publication of the book of Psalms in the time of the second temple. Regarding Chronicles, which is dated very late, he expresses surprise that such an unreliable book should be admitted to the canon and the Wisdom of Solomon be excluded. He assigns Proverbs to a post-Exilic date, denies unity to Jeremiah, regards Job as a translation of a Gentile poem, and questions the genuine- ness of Daniel. Spinoza hesitates to apply his criticism to the New Testament because of his lack of Greek, but insists at any rate that the apostles and evangelists had no miraculous powers and wrote simply as ordinary human beings. With respect to Jesus, he is surprisingly orthodox, even from the dogmatic Christian point of view. "God can communicate immediately with man; still, a man who can by pure intuition comprehend ideas neither contained in nor 15 Cogitata Metaphysica, 2 8. 16 This evidence appeared before Spinoza in the Systema Theologicum of La Peyrdre, 1655. 17 Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, 9. 13*</page><page sequence="9">184 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE deducible from the foundations of our natural knowledge, must possess a mind far superior to those of his fellow men; nor do I be- lieve that any have been so endowed save Christ. To him the ordi- nances of God were revealed directly, without words or visions. The voice of Christ, like the voice which Moses heard, may be called the voice of God, and it may be said that the wisdom of God took upon itself in Christ human nature and that he is the way of salvation." How we are to account for a Jew writing about Christ in such a manner is puzzling, but it looks as if he bent over backwards in his reaction to orthodox Judaism and in his accom- modation to Christian sentiment and tradition. On the other hand, he qualified the traditional view of the trinity as held by the Christian Church. "But as for the proposition enounced by some churches, that God took on him the nature of man, it seems to me as if one should tell me that a triangle had as- sumed the nature of a square." He shares with Ibn Ezra a belief in the spiritual rather than the literal or bodily resurrection of Christ and claims Paul as his authority. However, he thinks that the evangelists thought that Christ rose bodily. This is genuine historical criticism and shows more intellectual integrity than much that is taught in theological schools today. In view of Spinoza's observation of the editorial or redactional nature of Hebrew literature, and his differentiation between the thought of the New Testament writers and that of the present age, it can truly be said that this scholar paved the way for the modern scientific spirit in Biblical study. He was probably not the first, and certainly not the last, to deplore the idea of an authoritative, closed canon. Nothing has done more to retard religious progress than Bibliolatry! Spinoza was courageous enough to show that the Bible is not one book but many, coming from different periods of history and exhibiting different degrees of inspiration. It is noteworthy-but not surprising-that between Origen and the modern era of criticism which started with Simon and Astruc, the only names connected with the progress of Biblical Criticism are those of Jews. This has already been accounted for by the Christian rejection of the Greek spirit and the victory of Africanism,</page><page sequence="10">BRATTON: PRECURSORS OF BIBLICAL CRITICISM 185 which put a stop to all creative endeavor. Furthermore, it has been shown that most of the Christian reform movements and heresies down to and including the Reformation were influenced by Jewish scholars and that modern rationalism in the Christian church shows the imprint of Judaism to a remarkable degree.18 No movement can be known or appraised without a knowledge of its sources and backgrounds. What appears to be new and revolutionary is really continuous with the past (either synthet- ically or antithetically). It is with the purpose of reaffirming, therefore, the law of continuity that we have recalled in this paper the names of Origen, Ibn Ezra, and Spinoza. These three teachers of mankind, the first, in the ancient world, the second, in the medieval, and the third, in the modern, have made us their debtors, not only in the field of Biblical Criticism, but in a larger realm-the philosophy of life. 18 Cf.
