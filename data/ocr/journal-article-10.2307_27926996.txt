ISBN 960-7254-76-7. For the past several decades, the systematic publication of the rich corpus of Cypriote antiquities has been in progress, spurred on by the seemingly indefatigable Vassos Karageorghis, and supported by private foundations, notably the A.G. Leventis Foundation. At the same time, the pressing questions of Cypriote archaeology have been under discussion in frequent inter national symposia, followed by promptly published proceedings. This review does not cover all recent publications on the subject of Cypriote archaeology, but only a selection of those which have been submitted to the IEJ for review. Three recent books are part of the ongoing effort to publish public and private collections of Cypriote objects. The Potters' Art of Ancient Cyprus in the Collection of The Eretz Israel Museum, Tel Aviv (1) is a well-annotated catalogue of a good collection of 84 pieces of pottery and 18 terracotta figurines. For readers interested in specific categories of pottery, the chronologically organised catalogue includes the following: Early-Middle Cypriote red polished ware and black topped ware; Middle Cypriote red slip ware, black polished ware, white painted ware, and red-on-black ware; Middle-Late Cypriote Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware; Late Cypriote bichrome wheelmade ware, red lustrous wheelmade ware, base-ring ware, coarse monochrome ware and white painted ware; Cypro-Geometric bichrome ware and white painted ware; Cypro Archaic bichrome ware, black-on-red ware, and white painted ware; Cypro Classical and Hellenistic white painted ware; and medieval sgraffito ware. The terracotta figurines include a Late Cypriote bull and a Cypro-Geometric horse-and rider; otherwise the figurines are Cypro Archaic (horse-and-riders, warriors, male votaries, musicians, a priestess, a mother and child, votive masks and a monkey). Ancient Cypriote Art in the Sevens Collection (2) is another well-annotated catalogue presented in a format similar to that of the above volume, this time describing a larger collection of 257 items, mostly pottery. It contains most of the ceramic categories listed above, and in addition includes Chalcolithic pottery; Early Cypriote white painted ware; Middle Cypriote drab polished ware and red-on red ware; Late Cypriote black slip ware, black lustrous wheelmade ware, proto white painted ware, proto-bichrome ware, and plain white ware; Mycenaean pottery; Cypro-Geometric black-and-red ware, and grey and black polished ware; Cypro Archaic red slip ware, and grey and black polished ware; Cypro-Classical plain white ware and bichrome ware; and medieval plain glazed ware. Since both catalogues are fully illustrated with colour photographs of comparable high quality, and the overlapping ceramic categories show many variations of shape and surface design, the two books in conjunction can provide the student with an excellent introduction to Cypriote pottery.</page><page sequence="3">108 REVIEWS In addition to pottery, the main component of the Severis collection, the catalogue includes some fine examples of other types of artefact: Chalcolithic stone and terracotta figurines, and stone beads; an Early Cypriote bronze dagger, and stone beads and pendants; Middle Cypriote terracotta figurines; Late Cypriote stone vessels, terracotta figurines and a bronze dagger; Cypro-Archaic bronze vessels, and terracotta figurines and sculpture; a Cypro Classical bronze vessel; and Hellenistic glass. In contrast, the third catalogue reviewed here, The Art of Ancient Cyprus in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (3), is more modest in format, with smaller, mainly black-and-white illustrations. While the presentation does little to show the beauty of many of the 252 pieces catalogued here, this collection provides the reader with a much wider and more balanced view of the range of Cypriote artefacts. In this older, public collection, accumulated over more than a century, pottery accounts for only about one-third of the whole, the remainder comprising a rich assortment of terracotta models, figurines, sculpture and votive masks; stone cylinder seals, implements, figurines, sculpture and inscriptions; bronze figurines, implements and weapons; jewellery in precious metals; coins; and glass and faience. Balance is also found in chronology, since the Hellenistic and Roman periods are well represented in this collection. The group of publications under review here also includes three volumes of proceedings. The Development of the Cypriot Economy from the Prehistoric Period to the Present Day (4) publishes the results of a symposium which ranges over an enormous span of time. Although there is a consequent dilution of focus, the papers, which take various approaches, are quite interesting. Some of the papers emphasise the economic role of certain commodities, some concentrate on the economy of a particular period in Cyprus, others study specific categories of evidence such as written sources or pottery, while still others consider the interplay of socio-political forces and ideology with economics. The papers on commodities are: J.D. Muhly on metals in Late Bronze Age Cyprus; E. Raptou on copper and timber through the Roman period; S. Hadjisawas on the olive from ancient to modern times; and A. Luttrell on the sugar industry in the Frankish period. The contributions studying a period as a whole are: A. LeBrun on the Neolithic period; D. Michaelides on the Hellenistic and Roman periods; P. Gounarides on the Byzantine period; B. Arbel on the Venetian period; E. Rizopoulou-Egoumenidou on the Ottoman period; and S. Angelides and E. Andreou on modern times. Two of the papers studying specific categories of evidence concern the Late Bronze Age. V Karageorghis evaluates the written sources for Cypriote maritime trade, especially with respect to perishable goods; and D. Pilides surveys storage jars with respect to distribution, function and trade, to determine how they may reflect economic conditions. Another paper in this group, by C. Bakirtzis, studies the capaci ties of some Early Christian pottery types. The most sophisticated contributions to this symposium are those of E. Peltenburg and B.A. Knapp. Peltenburg treats economic development in the period c. 3500-1500 BCE within the context of socio political factors, considering how early state formation was inextricably related to the holding of wealth, the use of resources and the mechanisms of trade. Knapp's long paper is more speculative, arguing that production in Bronze Age Cyprus was dominated not by a religious authority but by a secular one, the crux of the matter</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 109 being the proper identification of secular ideology in the physical evidence of the period. Four Thousand Years of Images on Cypriote Pottery (5) records the proceedings of the Third International Conference of Cypriote Studies held in 1996. The papers actually cover pottery from a rather shorter span of time, the Early Cypriote period to the first century BCE. All the pottery discussed is either anthropomorphic or zoomorphic in form, or has painted or relief designs of humans or animals on the surface. The arrangement of papers in the volume is for the most part chronological. P. Astr?m begins with human representation in Neolithic wall painting and Early Cypriote pottery. There follow A. Caubet and R.S. Merrillees on Early and Middle Cypriote anthropo morphic and zoomorphic askoi; E. Herscher on animal and human relief decoration on pottery of the same period; L. Steel on an unusual bichrome floral and bird design on a white slip II krater; M. Yon on Late Cypriote zoomorphic rhyta; M. Iacovou on figurai representation in the proto-white painted ware of Late Cypriote UIC, the difficult transitional period to Cypro-Geometric; V Karageorghis on the local adaptation of Aegaean and Levantine elements in the pictorial style of Cypro Geometric I; K. Nys on the distribution and function of Cypro-Geometric and Cypro Archaic anthropomorphic vessels; N. Kourou on the classification and Aegaean connections of Cypro-Geometric zoo morphic askoi; A. Hermary on Cypro Geometric and Cypro-Archaic vessels with animal-head spouts; H. Cassimatis on rhyta in Cyprus; F. Vandenabeele on a Cypro Archaic and Cypro-Classical jug type with painted figurai decoration and an applied figure holding an oenochoe; and D. Michaelidis on Hellenistic magenta ware head vases. Two further papers are out of the chronological order: R. Laffineur on Bronze Age and Cypro-Geometric ring vases and their use as libation vessels; and A. Hermary on Cypro-Archaic 'Amathus style' vessels. Although there are no concluding remarks for the conference papers as a whole, the collected discussions of related ceramic material over such a long chronological span is helpful to the reader. At the very least, the continuity of zoomorphic vessels through the Geometric and Archaic periods is clearly established. The last of the three volumes of proceedings to be reviewed here ? and potentially the most important?is Eastern Mediterranean: Cyprus ? Dodecanese ? Crete, 16th-6th century B.C. (6), an international symposium held in 1997. The subject of interrelationships in this area is one of continuing interest, and as if in recognition of this fact, the discussion following each paper has been recorded after the text. Although in this volume there is as much information about the other areas as about Cyprus, the proceedings have been included in this review because of the important role of Cyprus in the cultural exchange under discussion. The quality of the contributions is generally very high, both in the clear presentation of the evidence and in its evaluation and interpretation. Some of the papers present recent finds, while others provide very useful re-evaluations of already published evidence. The papers are as follows: J. Shaw on evidence found at Kommos, especially Phoenician and Cypriote, for international contact in Late Minoan I-III; W.-D. Niemeier on Minoan imports and possible colonisation in the south-eastern Aegaean; P.P. Betancourt on a Cretan flask type of Near Eastern inspiration; T. Marketou on the possible social and religious implications of Minoan bronze 'adorant' statuettes from Rhodes and Kalymnos; L.</page><page sequence="5">110 REVIEWS Badre on imported Bronze and Iron Age pottery, particularly Mycenaean and Cypriote, from the Tell of Beirut; E. Karantzali on pottery from a Late Helladic IIIA2-IIIB cemetery at Pylona in Rhodes, especially a Mycenaean rhyton decorated with a Master of Animals; S. Deger Jalkotsky on evidence in the Aegaean islands for the period of the mainland Mycenaean collapse c. 1200 BCE; V. Karageorghis on gold plaques from a burial in Naxos, which are comparable to Cypro Geometric and Levantine examples and may represent Astarte; H.Matt?us on the connections between Crete and Cyprus from the thirteenth-eighth century BCE, featuring new metalwork from the Idaean Cave; A. Kanta and A. Karetsou on a re evaluation of the evidence from Arkhades and Rytion, to clarify Iron Age links with the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean, especially Cyprus; N.C. Stampolidis on recent finds at Eleutherna, including a bronze votive 'shield' of Idaean type, found in a context showing that these objects probably were lids of vessels; J.R Crielaard on a re-evaluation of evidence for patterns of communication and exchange from Cyprus throughout the Mediterranean in the eleventh and tenth centuries BCE; D. Christou on the earliest cremation cemetery found so far in Cyprus, at Amathus; A.R Agelarakis, A. Kanta and N.C. Stampolidis on the human and animal remains from the same cemetery at Amathus ? this paper and the foregoing attempt to reconstruct the mortuary ritual, and are followed by a spirited discussion of possible Phoenician or Punic relationships; G. Markoe on Phoenician interest in Crete for the sake of iron ores; N. Kourou and A. Karetsou on a re-used Phoenician stele cippus found in an Early Iron Age cemetery at Knossos; N. Coldstream on evidence for three alternative Phoenician trade routes; A. Hermary on votive offerings found in sanctuaries in Cyprus, Rhodes, and Crete, with respect to the identification of the deities and evidence of exchange in the dedication of imported items; H. Kyrieleis on wooden sculpture from Samos of Cretan origin; E. Walter-Karydi on East Dorian art in the Archaic period; and T. Eliopoulos on a Dark Age temple complex at Kephala Vasilikis in Crete, found with cult objects in situ. An exhibition of the same title, Eastern Mediterranean: Cyprus ? Dodecanese ? Crete, 16th-6th Century B.C., was held at the Archaeological Museum in Heraklion in 1998. The handsome accompanying volume (7) is by no means a picture book intended mainly for the general reader. The two long introductory chapters, by Kanta on the sixteenth-eleventh century BCE and Stampolidis on the eleventh-sixth century BCE, are fully documented and provide an excellent summary of the important issues, most of which were discussed at the related symposium in the preceding year. Their remarks are illustrated by items from the exhibition and are followed by a detailed catalogue of fifty of the most interesting pieces. Both this exhibition volume and the related symposium proceedings are very rewarding for the reader in the large quantity of well-organised and beautifully illustrated information they provide. The two last books included in this review fall outside the categories of exhibition catalogues or conference proceedings. Greek Gods and Heroes in Ancient Cyprus (8) presents images of deities found in Cyprus, dating from the Bronze Age to the fifth century CE. In a clearly written text accessible to the general reader and documented for the student, Karageorghis explains the local traditions in ancient Cyprus and the adaptations in different periods of Near Eastern and especially Greek deities. The well illustrated text is followed by an</page><page sequence="6">reviews 111 annotated catalogue of all the illustrated items and a substantial bibliography. Excavating at Salamis in Cyprus 1952-1974 (9) is a memoir by Karageorghis of his two-decade-long association with the site of Salamis. The text, although organised by excavation areas, emphasises the human element of excavating, with many photographs of workers, associates and visitors, to whom this book is a touching tribute. Two appendices enrich the text, one by Marangou on the earlier history of the ruins of Salamis, and another by Yon on the experiences of the French mission to Salamis. Gloria S.
