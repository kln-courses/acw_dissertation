<plain_text><page sequence="1">164 NEW EVIDENCE CONCERNING AN EYE-DIVINITY bj E. DOUGLAS VAN BUREN The study of ancient religious beliefs is beset with difficulties because we do not know with absolute certainty what the peoples who inhabited the Near East in very ancient times really intended to convey by the designs they depicted. That those designs were not merely decorative but had a special symbolic or apotropaic value seems to be beyond question. In consequence of this ignorance of ours there is a tendency to accept explanations which seem to afford fairly satisfactory interpretations of many of these problems, and also an endeavour to expand them to the utmost to make them cover, direcdy or indirecdy, as wide a field as possible. When an example occurs which cannot be forced to conform to the rules laid down by the explanations, it is said to be a peripheral work, or the mistaken rendering of an ignorant craftsman, or even a forgery. From time to time, however, a book appears which deals with the subject of the religion of the ancients in some or all of its aspects, and which is full of new ideas, sometimes of a revolutionary character. Whether all the views enunciated by the author are accepted or not such a work has the salutary effect that it compels the reader to revise his preconceived ideas and to study carefully the opinions expressed in order to determine whether they should be rejected or accepted as a whole or with modifications. A book of this kind is the one which has recently been published, and which treats of the Eye-god.1 The tide itself is arresting and makes us pause to consider whether we are fully persuaded that an Eye-god in the strictest sense of the term ever existed, in spite of the fact that such a divinity is not explicitly vouched for by any text as yet deciphered, although many texts mention the far-seeing, penetrating eyes of divinities, and late texts allude to the " evil eye". An Eye-god might be supposed to imply a divine being with one enormous all-seeing eye, but no representation of such a being is known to exist. The nearest approach to such a being can be seen on a clay relief repre- senting the Sun(?)-Cyclops (?) with a single eye in his forehead whose head is being cut off by another divinity.2 Professor M. E. L. Mallowan, the excavator of Tell Brak, discovered in the grey brick stratum of the temple, which is attributed to the Jamdat Nasr period, an extraordinary abundance of little idols or votive offerings,3 for at least 1 Margarete Riemschneider, Augmgott und heilige Hochait, pp. 317, 72 Figs, in text, 4 pis.

The idols consisted of an oblong, flat body, tapering towards the top and made to be laid flat. Their distinguishing, indeed their sole feature, is a pair of obliquely set eyes filled in with colour, and consequently their discoverer termed the little objects " eye-idols ". Occasionally four-eyed figurines were forthcoming ; sometimes a smaller figure is traced on the front of the body of a larger specimen as if to suggest a mother and child, and there are examples with three or six eyes, thought to symbolize a triad. The discoverer of the idols acknowledges that their exact significance is conjectural, and therefore in the course of his admirable analysis of the objects found at Brak, and wishing to show absolute impartiality, he suggests several possible alternative meanings of the eye-idols. These alternatives may be briefly enumerated as follows : (i) they were benevolent and protective eyes, magic eyes dedicated in the temple itself to the god of Brak who specialized in healing diseases of the eyes ;x (2) they embodied the personality of the individual dedicator, or symbolized the dedicator projecting himself through the image of the deity ;2 (3) they were the abstract symbol of some divinity,3 or were carved after the image and likeness of the divinity to whom they were dedicated ;4 (4) this divinity, if not the Mother-goddess herself, must have had the same powers of reproduction and generative force.5 The wide choice of alternative interpretations of the significance of the eye-idols here offered is a proof of the complexity and obscurity of the subject. In support of the last-mentioned interpretation he points out that the architecture of the building relates the Brak Eye-Temple very closely to a series of temples of the Uruk and Jamdat Nasr periods in the Eanna precinct at Uruk,6 temples which " were committed to an unbroken tradition of Mother-goddess worship " in the person of the goddess Innin ; moreover, the votive offerings at the two sites were identical in character. " The outer walls of the Eye-Temple at Brak were decorated with rosettes, which at Uruk also appear to be emblems of the Mother-goddess ".7 Therefore it is logical to suppose that in both places the cult was devoted to the same divinity. The eye-idols bear none of the out- standing aspects of motherhood manifested by the figurines of palaeolithic times onwards, which are invariably undraped, whereas on many of the eye- idols clothing and ornaments seem indicated, as well as head-gear of various types, one of which (Pl. LI, Nos. 35-7, 45, 47) seems to be the prototype of the c mitre ' worn by the goddess at Mari.

DOUGLAS VAN BUREN not due to a fundamental change of religion, but to a change in symbolism, for instead of the stark realism of the earlier figurines there was an increasing tendency towards abstraction.1 He is of the opinion that the so-called ' spectacle-idols * {Brillenidole) were an older form of the symbol from which the eye-idols were evolved.2 The former, however, differ from the latter in several particulars, such as the rounded or convex form of the body which was made to stand upright, the lack of any neck in the majority of examples, the holes perforated to represent the eyes which in the eye-idols were rendered by a coloured filling, and because in addition to alabaster they were sometimes made of serpentine, shale, or terra-cotta, and, above all, by the fact that they were discovered at numerous widely separated sites, whereas Brak is the only place where eye-idols have come to light. The connexion between the two types is, nevertheless, un- deniable and is now generally acknowledged, so much so that many writers now class them together indiscriminately, and discuss them as a single group.3 Perhaps they may be regarded as two independently developed concepts of the same symbol. Several years before the Brak objects were excavated attention was first called to the spectacle-idols by Professor Walter Andrae who named them ? hut-symbols ' because he believed they represented the symbolic image of a reed hut surmounted by the divine symbol of the Mother-goddess.4 Com- plete demonstration of his theory was, he thought, afforded by the most highly developed specimen of the series, a steatite ' Haus-Symbol9 (No. ??? 12,. Vor- derasiatisches Museum, Berlin), the lower part or base of which, according to him, is decorated to represent the door-way and the patterned reed mats hung upon the walls of the shrine ; the elongated upper part, terminating in two perforated rings, represents the c Ringbundel \ symbol of the goddess Lmin.5 This theory was amplified by Frankfort who saw in the ? Haus-Symbol \ V.A. 10112, the allegorical expression of the presence of the goddess within her shrine.6 Tobler disagrees for several reasons with the identification as * hut-symbols ', or even as cult objects, and in his discussion of the small finds at Gaura he suggests that the stone examples of the type, found at Gaura almost exclusively in Strata XI A-IX, were loom weights, and that the lighter clay specimens were probably also used in the weaver's craft.7 Dr. Charlotte Ziegler gives an excellent summary of the views expressed on the subject by earlier writers.8 She admits that it is not easy to decide between these varying opinions, but very sensibly adds that perhaps it is not necessary xIbid., ?. 152. %Ibid., pp. 34, 154-6. ?

She considers, however, that the analogous idols found at K?ltepe undoubtedly symbolized a Mother-goddess, and she therefore concludes that the significance of the eye-idols as images of a Mother-goddess seems to be so convincing that all attempts at other explanations seem forced. The consensus of opinion in favour of regarding both eye-idols and spectacle- idols as an expression of a Mother-goddess cult has, nevertheless, now been challenged by Dr. Margarete Riemschneider in a book the subject of which is nominally the Eye-God.1 The argument, however, is complicated and the abundance of the material discussed is so overwhelming that the reader is apt to become bemused by such a mass of presumptive evidence. For that reason only the essential points of her arguments in the briefest possible outline can here be mentioned, and the interesting bye-paths into which she endeavours to entice us must be left unexplored. She believes that in very ancient times the cult of the Eye-god was universal. He was the great deity of the nomads, those wanderers over the desert whose eyes were accustomed to survey the tractless waste and pierce to limitless horizons. His cult was everywhere supreme, with the exception of those places where the cult of the Mother-goddess predominated,2 He was, moreover, not merely the Eye-god, but he was also the Twin-god. In very ancient times divinities were not represented in anthropomorphic form, but by symbols, the god by a rhomb (eye) in some form, the Mother- goddess by a vase, for fertility in its every manifestation was generated in her sacred body which was at one and the same time the receptacle of reproductive force, the shrine, and the tomb in which every man aspired to be interred in order to be re-created and re-born to a new and more vigorous life.3 The sacred vase, termed the Gi-gab, was a large vessel with wide mouth and a high curved handle on each side, made to stand on the ground ; it is frequently illustrated on the squat Jamdat Nasr cylinder seals.4 In the second millennium the earlier concrete image of the vase was transformed into that of a female figure who stands frontally and raises the lower border of her skirt shoulder- high on each side.5 The rhomb, ubiquitous in the repertories of prehistoric glyptic art and painted ceramics, whether depicted as detached or linked, is said to signify the Eye-god in abstract form. The reason why the linked rhombs were usually in triplicate (figs. 3, 4, 6) is said to be because the threefold rendering signified c many ', and thus a multiplicity of eyes can easily be understood.6 1 Riemschneider, Augengott und heilige Hochzeit. 2 Ibid., p. 22. *lbid., pp. 106-7, m?

DOUGLAS VAN BUREN In spite of the vaunted logic of this reasoning we are, nevertheless, left in perplexity whether the manifold ? eyes * symbolized a single supreme Eye-god or a vast number of lesser eye-divinities. The explanation of the varying manner in which the ' eye ' is delineated is said to be because it is not a natural human eye which is depicted, but a symbol, and thereby the god.1 Another abstract image of the Eye-god is an idol from Susa in the form of two perforated rings of asphalt mounted one above the other on a base (fig. 5)2. A later form of the symbol is said to consist of a post to the upper part of which pairs of superimposed rings were attached symmetrically on each side ; it was usually represented projecting in pairs above the roof of a reed hut serving as a byre from which cattle issued (fig. 16). This post was the urigallu, the allegorical image of a group of twin gods, Nergal, Meslamtsea, and the talim? A painting on a clay pot from Susa of the style of Susa II (fig. i) is usually described as representing a man standing between two spears planted upright on bases.4 The authoress, however, thinks that the shafts are not crowned by spear-heads, but by schematized eyes, and therefore the figure standing between them is that of an Elamite Twin-god,5 regardless of the fact that elsewhere she says that at so early a period the gods were not portrayed in human form. It is difficult for us to imagine worship being paid to a divinity whose eyes were hoisted on shafts placed on each side of him. Dr. Riem- schneider, however, quite rightly reminds us more than once that ideas con- cerning religion and symbolism held by the men of those days were very different from those familiar to us, as, for instance, the idea that the supreme god could manifest himself in the intertwined necks and tails of grotesque animals, and the Mother-goddess in the form of a vase of a particular shape.6 After a time the need was felt for something more concrete than an abstract symbol as an object of veneration, and hence the necessity arose to create the image of a divinity who could be approached, honoured, and even adorned.7 Consequently representations of the eye-symbol were embellished, not at first with facial features, but with bands, streamers, or head-gear (figs, n, a, b, 12, 14), the most striking examples of the tendency being the Brak eye-idols. Seal impressions found at Ur in the Seal Impression Strata are said always to represent the Mother-goddess as a vase, but the god in the guise of a naked man.8 This changed in the Second Early Dynastic period when both partners in the rites of the sacred marriage appear in anthropomorphic form. A step further was taken at a later period when the anonymous Eye-god became or * Ibid., p. y 2 M.D.P. ???, pi. XXXVI, 3. 3 Riemschneider, op. cit., pp. 15-17, figs. 16, 19. 4 Pottier, M.D.P.

The epithet expresses the essential characteristic of the deity, for he was " the god with the holy eye in his fore- head ",1 His cycle comprised numerous double personalities or twin gods, among them being his minister, the bifrons Usm?, and his sons the twin gods who acted as guardians of the gate. At that time Ea was regarded as Lord of the sweet waters and also those of the Underworld. He built his dwelling, in which there was a secret chamber called the gigunu, " above the ab%u ", not, indeed, actually in the water, but on an island floating upon the flood and upon which the earthly paradise Dilmun was situated. According to Dr. Riemschneider Ea stood in the closest relationship to the vase out of which two symmetrical streams of water flowed.2 How came he, she asks, into possession of that vase with which originally he had nothing to do ? The vase with its two curving sides so plainly recalls the formation of the gi-gab that it is evidendy in that direction that the solution of the problem must be sought. It would not be surprising if the Mother-goddess held in her hands?as in fact she sometimes does?a vase from which fertilizing streams perpetually poured forth. If she bestowed that vase upon her divine bride- groom it would have been in the truest sense a wedding gift, and would explain the apparently strange metamorphosis of the ancient Eye-god into the Water- god. It must also be remembered that the male Nin-gods, like Nin-urta, Nin-gizzida, and Nin-igi-ku all developed out of the divine consort of the goddess.3 In the late Early Dynastic and Akkadian periods when the Sun-god Shamash voyaged in his boat across the sky he was accompanied by objects of many kinds, man-headed lion, scorpion, plough, vase,4 none of which belonged to the equipment of a boat, but are all mimetic symbols of the sacred marriage ; they indicate that he made aq/attempt to usurp the position as divine consort without ever succeeding in ousting completely his rival the Eye-god in the form of Nin-igi-ku, Ninurta or any other of the Nin-gods.5 Many epics are in the ultimate analysis related allegorically to the legend of the Eye-god. Among them are the story of Etana and the Eagle containing the account of the twin gods Dumuzi and Ningizzida who guarded the door of Anu's palace in the heavens ; the story of the tree from which Gilgamesh fashioned the mekku and pukku* objects which were not musical instruments as some writers have supposed, but were the net and the snare used by hunters of wild animals, and both of them important ritual implements in the cult of the Eye-god ; the story of how Ea disclosed to a reed hut the decision of the gods to overwhelm mankind with a flood.7 1 Ibid., p. 13. 2 Ibid., pp. 140-1. 3 Ibid., p. 133. 4 Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, pl.

DOUGLAS VAN BUREN The close connexion between Ea and a reed hut arose from the fact that originally the reed hut symbolized the palace of the god built above the ab^u. This reed hut was a temple and also a stall for young animals, a place of birth a lazarette, a place for burial and re-creation, at once the grave, the festival hall, and the place for the determination of fate. The significance of the reed hut is thus so similar to that of the gi-gab, the sacred vase which pre-figured the Mother-goddess, that the shift in meaning from gi ' reed * to gig ' dark \ ' night ' is easily comprehensible, for the mime of the sacred marriage was performed at night, and the interior of the vase (= grave) was always pictured as dark.1 The diorite plaque of Ur-nanshe speaks of " the reed of Enki " in an abbre- viated allusion to his sanctuary.2 Gi, the sign for reed, formed part of the names of numerous temples because theoretically they all signified the reed hut' of Ea.3 These later temples, however, were only symbolically c reed huts ', for reeds no longer entered into the construction of the building ; therefore the gigunu within them might be made of cedar-wood or any other choice material. Often in glyptic art a single reed suffices to indicate a whole temple.4 In this context it is important to consider the root PA and its derivatives.5 Pa is the leafy growth from which the herdsman cut the switch with which he controlled his cattle, hence pa-udu ' herdsman \ But pa was also the rod with which chastisements were administered, and by an extension of the idea, the ? overseer \ Thus pa-te-si &lt; the overseer in the temple ', although the chief office of the patesi was not to carry out the business affairs of the temple, but to act as substitute for the divine consort. An expression like " he who fills the temen " cannot be taken literally. Here temen is the Akkadian temmenu, the foundation tablet on which episodes of the sacred marriage were depicted, and which had a hole in the middle into which the post-like foundation figurine was stuck. Figurine and tablet together guaranteed the birth of the building beneath which they were buried as a divine entity.6 As manifestations of the Eye-god the ' eyes * represented on gaming-boards found in the Royal Cemetery at Ur7 are exceptionally important because they necessitate an investigation of the purpose for which the gaming-boards and the accompanying gaming-pieces as well as the dice {parsit, me) were used. 1 Riemschneider, op. cit., p. 113. 2 Thureau-Dangin, S.A.K., p. 6, b ; Witzel, A.f.O.

I must confess, however, even if it convicts me of ignorance, that I cannot recall a.single authentic foundation tablet on which the hieros gamos is illustrated. Here there seems to be some confusion between true foundation tablets and the New Year Festival plaques found at Tell Agrab, Khafajah, and Ur (Frankfort, Sculpture of the Third Millennium B.C.

Apparently therefore the games or moves were not always identical. This subject Dr. Riemschneider examines with great thoroughness, and she cites many texts in confirmation of her theory, the translations given being mostly her own renderings.1 She thinks that certain texts imply that sometimes the boards were used to play a game known by the name of " Heaven and Earth ",2 in which one side stood for the sun, the other for the moon ;3 squares (or fields) decorated with rosettes or stars could be taken only by pieces marked with a cross = sun, those adorned with eyes or figures of animals could be captured only with pieces on which diagonals = moon were represented. A player cast the dice and in accordance with the value indicated by the throw he placed his gaming- piece on one particular square as a sign that he had captured that position, an action which a text describes metaphorically as " setting his foot upon " it {Sumer. Kultlieder 199, 11 : 17). It must be observed, however, that the text, even in Dr. Riemschneider's version, does not state that he set his foot upon the square or field captured, but on the dice {parsu)y a statement susceptible of quite a different interpretation. Like other writers Dr. Riemschneider believes that the gaming-boards were used for purposes of divination, the future good or evil fortune of the enquirer being foretold by the fall of the dice. She quotes a text (S.T. V.C. 46, II : 9-11) to show that the gods themselves made use of gaming-boards which were called barag, the " Gl?ckstischen ",4 not only as divining boards, but also as seats upon which they took their places when about to * play ' ceremonially {C.T. XXXVI, No. 28 : i3).5 The gaming-boards were cult implements in the sense that they were used in the rites of the sacred marriage. The divine partners were seated opposite to one another, and each in turn cast the dice (parsu) which would predict what would happen to them. Thus the Hymn to Bau {CT. XXXVI, 36 : 6-26) describes how in the temple E-sil-sir-sir, place of the determination of destinies, Ningirsu and the goddess Bau, under the benevolent surveillance of Anu and Enlil, consulted the gaming-board to learn what their destiny would be.6 The real intention of the narrative of Inanna's descent into the Nether-world is said to be to describe how she * played ', firstly with Anu, and later with Tammuz.7 In that story the seven cities men- tioned are parallelled by the seven ornaments which Inanna laid aside, and by the seven pars ft she held in her hand. 1 Riemschneider, op. cit., pp. 158-211. 2 Ibid., pp. 184, 185, 187. 8 Ibid., pp. 161, 166. 4lt?., pp. 188-9, *95&gt; 205? 5 Ibid., pp. 190-1, fig. 58. 6 Ibid., pp. 174-5,185-6,195 (C.T.

DOUGLAS VAN BUREN All this elaborate theory is expounded at great length and with an enormous amount of corroborative evidence containing much helpful information. For the purpose of the theory gaming-board, gaming-pieces, and dice {parsa) are all treated as parts of one whole. There is ample proof that gaming-boards and pieces belonged together because at Ur the boards were hollow and the interior was fashioned into the shape of a box to contain the pieces required to play the game ; in grave PG-789 " we found inside the box the complete set of ? men ' ",1 Apparently in the game the * men ' were moved from square to square as in chess or draughts. The association of the pars? with the other two is, however, less clear. Even the texts quoted in support of the theory, with the possible exception of C.T. XVI, 6 : 209-13, do not imply that the pars? were used in conjunction with the gaming-board. The parsa were small, and many texts indicate that they could be held in the hand and cast, apparently usually without the aid of any dice-box or container. Furthermore, ?ic pars? were never marked with an eye or rhomb. The gaming-boards may very probably have been used for purposes of divination, the pars? were undoubtedly so used, for they were the seven dots used in casting lots or in determining the fate of individuals.2 Known from very early times, their mystic value was so great that they were constantly represented in every age, with the possible exception of the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur, and they were translated to the Heavens as an astral symbol // Sibitti (Pleiades). On account of the purpose for which they were used their importance was immense, but like that other universal symbol, the sacred tree, their significance seems to have been general rather than particular in the sense that they were not the attributes of any one divinity, and, in spite of the detailed interpretation.offered us, it is difficult to regard them as abstract symbols of the Eye-god. Interpretations of a religious cult which originated in the dawn of civilization must necessarily be tentative or purely hypothetical. Its real significance can only be surmised from what we know of the traces of it which survived into later and more literate ages. The problem of an eye-divinity seems best approached by means of the so-called spectacle-idols, and even better by the eye-idols found at Tell Brak. As the latter were found in a temple and had been carefully preserved they were almost certainly sacred objects. The eyes and brows, the latter sometimes indefinitely multiplied, are the only features represented, for there is no indication of sex, unless a smaller figure occa- sionally traced on the front of some of the larger idols can be taken as such, because it seems to represent a child with whom only a female figure would be associated. 1 Woolley, Ur Excavations ?.

Examples with two pairs of eyes,2 instead of being intended to represent a divine couple, may be meant to symbolize the ambivalent nature of the divinity, that is to say, " embodying both the male and female element in reproduction ".3 The spectacle-idols, some of which were also found at Brak, had a much wider diffusion, for they have been discovered at ancient sites almost all over the Near East. There have been many attempts to explain both spectacle- idols and eye-idols. Every interpreter of the subject has advanced our know- ledge by at least one step, and thus the seemingly discordant opinions are not utterly irreconcilable. Andrae, the earliest investigator of the problem, believed that the spectacle- idols symbolized the reed hut, the primitive shrine, surmounted by a divine symbol as exemplified by the most highly developed specimen V.A. 10112. Frankfort saw in the spectacle-idols the symbolic image of the goddess in her temple. Mallowan made a big advance by his meticulous examination of the eye-idols, and by insisting upon their connexion with the spectacle-idols which he considers were an earlier and more abstract embodiment of the same concept. In his discussion of the eye-idols he makes the suggestion that there may have been a life-size figure of the Eye-god standing on the cult base in his temple,4 which would have been a noteworthy technical feat at the period. This Eye-god Dr. Margarete Riemschneider endeavours to recon- struct for us, and to set forth the importance and wide-reaching significance of his cult. One of her greatest contributions to the solution of the problem is that she persuades us to re-examine the whole subject, and to try to follow her into the intricate maze of facts and conjectures through which she moves with such ease and confidence. If an Eye-god really existed it is perfectly understandable that at first he should be represented only by symbols, the most conspicuous and the one of longest duration being the rhomb (eye), always rendered in approximately the same way from the earliest times to the end of the Assyrian Empire. If the rhomb really symbolized the Eye-god it seems strange that a symbol, which consequently must have been of extreme sanctity, should have been relegated to the position of a c filling motive \ The complex of evidence concerning the 1 Mallowan, Iraq IX, Pt. 2, p. 15 3 ; pi.

DOUGLAS VAN BUREN rhomb seems to demonstrate that, in spite of its obviously intense significance, it never seems to have been indubitably connected with any particular deity, but, like the sacred tree and the seven dots, to have been a widely diffused symbol, the meaning of which in its fullest import was immediately compre- hensible to the beholder.1 It also seems strange that in later ages when all the great gods, not excepting Anu,2 were portrayed in easily identifiable anthropomorphic forms, the design of a rhomb sufficed to symbolize the supreme Eye-god, and that no anthropomorphic image of him was created. Perhaps this query is answered by the statement that in Early Akkadian and later periods the Eye-god was impersonated by Ea whose im^ge, however, was so clearly characterized as a Water-god that, except to the eye of faith, all traces of the ancient Eye or Twin-god are entirely absorbed. The flowing vase, which Ea almost invariably holds, did not, we are told, originally belong to him but to the Mother-goddess who gave it as a wedding gift to him in his capacity of bridegroom. The shape of the flowing vase is said to recall the gi-gab which symbolized the Mother-goddess ; it must be a very remote re- minder, for the flowing vase was invariably depicted as a small round-bodied, broad-lipped aryballos, whereas the vase typifying the goddess was an oval- shaped vessel so big that it was cumbersome to lift or hold and therefore was always stood on the ground. At Susa the flowing vase was associated with Enki on the painted pottery of the second style,3, but in spite of the assertion that the Mother-goddess is shown holding it, there are, as far as I know, no representations of her doing so before the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur. The charming little nymph-like goddesses who pour water from round-bodied vases on the basin of Gudea and the stele of Urnammu were only ancillary divinities. The statement that every representation of a reed hut symbolized Ea's house built above the ab^u is slightly misleading, for the reed huts represented can be identified as the property of a male or female deity by the characteristic symbol of the divine owner erected at the door or on the roof.4 There is no repre- sentation of a reed hut marked with any symbol or attribute of Ea who, however, is pictured seated majestically in his watery shrine as depicted by a fine cylinder seal from Ur and several other examples.5 From the section on the gaming-boards or pars? there is much to be learnt, and some of Dr. Riemschneider's deductions throw a new light upon an exceedingly compli- cated subject. 1 Van Buren, Symbols of the Gods, pp. 115-19. 8 Parrot, I.L.N.

She concludes that all the evidence proves con- vincingly that both spectacle- and eye-idols symbolized a Mother-goddess who in later ages was known by the names of Innin-Inanna-Ishtar. This belief was so widely spread and so firmly held that even when it seemed to have disappeared completely it still survived down to the end of the second millennium when it flowered again with all the appropriate symbolism as shown by the curious figure incised in outline in inexpert fashion on a votive bronze mirror found in T uristan.1 The figure represented is that of a female in frontal attitude who holds a palm-branch in each hand outstretched laterally. Her head or face is a perfect reproduction of the two perforated rings of the earliest spectacle-idols, and the inverted V-shaped tracing above her head suggests a mitre recalling the head-gear of some of the eye-idols, and identi- fying the figure as a divinity. Her body to the waist is undraped, but multitudinous fine lines radiating outwards indicate her skirt and resemble the so-called architectural decoration on the lower part of V.A.10112 ; it even suggests the possibility that V.A.10112 did indeed derive from an abstract symbol of the goddess, and that the lower part of the idol was really intended to symbolize her body, not in the form of a vase, however, but in human shape, and that an amalgamation of the symbolism for image and shrine caused the indications of the skirt which was supposed to drape her lower limbs to be transformed into the semblance of the decoration of a temple fa?ade. The two lions guarding her on each side and the rosettes round the edge of the field identify the divinity as the goddess Inanna. The line of succession thus traced seems to demonstrate very convincingly that the cult was of such stupendous significance that it survived at least until the twelfth century B.C., and that the figure symbolized was not only feminine, as the presence of the child testifies, but was also that of a great female divinity of fertility in all its aspects. The lions and rosettes of the mirror identify the goddess as Inanna. The late evidence of the Luristan bronze seems to prove the perspicacity of Professor Mallowan's deductions from the accumulative evidence furnished by the discoveries at Brak to which reference has already been made,2 and to re-enforce, even if it does not irrefutably confirm the supposition that both spectacle and eye-idols symbolized a female divinity who was known in later ages as the great Mother-goddess. 1 Ziegler, M.D.O.G.
