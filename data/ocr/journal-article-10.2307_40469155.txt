Jackson Centre for Jewish Studies, University of Manchester On Justice: An Essay in Jewish Philosophy by Lenn E. Goodman is a welcome paper- back reprint of Goodman's 1991 study (Yale University Press), with an expanded Introduction. 562 Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 59, Number 4 October 2009 562-565 © 2009 by University of Hawai'i Press</page><page sequence="2">It is an ambitious work: its scope encompasses divine and natural, as well as hu- man, justice; its methodology aspires to a "comparative philosophy/' It argues for a deserts-based concept of justice both in the human sphere (with particular reference to punishment and recompense) and in that of divine justice (included are chapters on messianism and the afterlife). Much of Western philosophy, Goodman argues, "often pretends to universality by spreading a thin secular mulch over its much older, thicker Christian roots'' (p. xv); now, however, the climate (of cultural diversity) is changing so as to allow "a genuine cosmopolitan discourse" in which scholars who "critically appropriate the riches of their own heritage" may address "an ecumenical community in their own distinctive voices" (p. xviii). But within what framework is this to be done? "The method of On Justice/' Goodman tells us, "is to work philosophically to a conceptual approach to specific problems about justice and to test the outcomes of that enquiry against the resources of Western and Jewish philosophy" (p. xx). That seems to imply (a) that the concep- tual approach is culturally neutral, and (b) that what it is tested against is equally (if now non-neutral ly) "philosophical." I doubt that (a) is possible. As for (b), much of the Jewish tradition on which Goodman draws is, he recognizes, not "philo- sophical" but rather "exegetical." Thus, "my aim has been to inform exegesis with philosophy, and philosophy with the fruits of exegesis The outcome, I hope, casts some new light on the philosophic issues by showing how the Jewish sources speak to issues of universal human concern." But "the Jewish sources," as Goodman is well aware, do not speak with a single voice. His use of them is necessarily eclectic (e.g., his account of the zealotry of Phi- neas at pp. 44 and 242 n. 6, as the debates over Rabin's assassination only too pain- fully show). More worrying, perhaps, is the question of what they actually do "speak to" (in their own historical and cultural diversity). While this may be a manageable problem for the more systematic and speculative writings, such as those of Philo, Maimonides, and Saadiah (from which Goodman frequently draws), it is much more substantial for the biblical and early rabbinic sources. Here, I fear, no "com- parative philosophy" is possible before or in the absence of systematic internal in- vestigation (recognizing the dependence of meaning on internal structural relation- ships), as represented, for example, by Jacob Neusner's magnum opus (The Halakhah: An Encyclopaedia of the Law of Judaism [Brill, 2000]; The Theology of the Halakhah [Brill, 2001]) on the philosophy of the "classical" halakhah and by Aaron Kirshen- baum ("The Role of Punishment in Jewish Criminal Law: A Chapter in Rabbinic Pe- nological Thought" in The Jewish Law Annual IX [1991], pp. 123-143) and others (Peretz Segal, "Postbiblical Jewish Criminal Law and Theology" in The Jewish Law Annual IX [1991], pp. 107-121) on the role of capital punishment as a kapparah. How, then, are we to react when we find that theological positions revealed by such internal investigation are rejected by Goodman on the basis of his "conceptual approach," or where they would "undercut the foundation of our theology in the ex- perience of nature and history" (pp. 128-129; emphasis added). The answer, in fact, is straightforward: this simply illustrates the thoroughgoing philosophical critique that Goodman is applying to the Jewish tradition itself, in the course of his "compar- Book Reviews 563</page><page sequence="3">ative philosophy/' No one should assume from the subtitle of the book, An Essay in Jewish Philosophy, that what is being compared is a normative, mainstream account. As Goodman himself puts it: "I want to see and show that my thoughts about justice resonate with core themes of the Mosaic symphony I don't attempt, as an apolo- gist might, to salvage every scrap and straw cast up by the canon. The aim is critical appropriation" (p. xxi). The chapter on the afterlife provides a case in point. Particularly interesting (and challenging) is Goodman's account of the relations between divine, natural, and human justice. He adopts a tripartite ontology: tran- scendence (God), nature, and humanity. Both natural and human beings (entities) have value and deserts, but while human justice concerns the conscious recognition of deserts, natural justice does not; rather it "acts as a mean between the metaphys- ical justice [equated with "divine justice"] of existential desert (perfect but imper- sonal) and human justice (personal but imperfect)" (pp. 119-120). Natural justice "is not considerate. Nature stands aside for no one" - even, apparently, God. For natural entities are themselves "beings" with claims: "Divine justice as it works in nature is the optimal recognition of all claims. The claims of fire and water, wind and frost, are real and recognized according to their power, even when the elements . . . which may bedevil (!) our existence . . . are not on the same ontic level with the beings they threaten" (p. 124). It is within this framework that Goodman confronts the problem of natural disas- ters and seeks to rebut interpretations of them as divine punishments. "The tsunami was not a judgment. Only superstition, perhaps mingled with scorn and pity for the victims would call it that. It was a blind outcome of the same forces that formed and still form the earth" (p. xxxviii). Divine law is indeed relevant here. But not in the form of rewards and punishments. The motivation for adherence to divine law is love of God rather than reward and punishment: "only adherence of the sort that expresses our love of God will provide us with the security the Law promises, freeing us in some measure from the vicissitudes of nature by giving us a social system whose stability can withstand and whose values can surmount those vicissitudes" (p. 149). Note the qualification "in some measure." Goodman still accepts that "[t]he forces of nature operate without moral intent and are therefore morally neutral, not responsible" (p. 151). "Divine justice is not meted out by a marionette-master prov- idence that would negate the very reality of nature" (p. 131). I find this difficult. Why, we may ask, did God choose to create (an imperfect?) nature in this way - a (nonnormative) "universal natural justice" based on a God- created (but not necessarily God-controlled) nature? The reply appears to reside in a conception of ongoing creation in which humanity participates (p. 155). It seems, then, that humans are partly responsible for natural disasters, but in a causal way rather than as a result of punishment. Yet God does appear to retain at least a resid- ual capacity to intervene in nature. Goodman speaks of the "miracle of creation, set- ting nature under the attributes of justice and mercy" (his emphasis). Without this, he would have to deny omnipotence. Even with it, he has to accept absence. But that is a notion with which we have sadly become all too familiar. There is also a historical issue here. Despite Goodman's invocation of the Aris- 564 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="4">totelian conception of nature ("we are not, any of us, merely what we are. We are also who we might become - a better or a lesser being, whose traits we acquire and indeed define in the choices we make" [p. xxx]), which has rightly been termed teleological, his own ontology of nature appears to be strictly descriptive and causal, in conformity with modern scientific conceptions. It is thus an "anthropomorphic" confusion to apply our moral notions to the natural realm (p. Ί23). But the biblical account of creation is itself by fiat, as Hans Kelsen (Society and Nature [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1943]; The Pure Theory of Law [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1 967], pp. 1 8-22) pointed out in describing the "primitive" histori- cal roots of the is/ought confusion. And Goodman himself describes law and nature as "God's two utterances" (p. 141). Jewish law itself adopted a "teleological" con- ception of the dherekh of animals, though Maimonides reformulated it in purely de- scriptive terms (Jackson, in Jewish Law Annual 1 [1978]: 168-176). Goodman rec- ognizes the survival of such notions in the context of natural disasters when he writes: "We take that fact [that nature stands aside for no one] for granted in our practical affairs yet often feel offended by it when we shift to an evaluative mode" (p. 122). It will be interesting to compare Goodman's critical accounts with more system- atic internal reconstructions of different Jewish traditions. For example, how may we understand the apparent movement from a "monistic" to a "dualistic" conception of the relationship between human law and divine justice (Jackson, in Daimon 4 [2004]: 31-48), and the relationship of imitatio between them? It is hoped that Goodman's work will find its "ecumenical community" within the Jewish world as well as outside it.</page></plain_text>
