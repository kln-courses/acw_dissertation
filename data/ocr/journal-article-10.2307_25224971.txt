<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters Radiosensitive tissues can be shielded during CT scanning Editor?Rehani and Berry point out the rising contribution that computed tomogra phy has made to the collective radiation dose in the United Kingdom and give possi ble ways to limit this development.1 Patients and clinicians often have little incentive to forgo a quick, painless, and accurate computed tomography study to check the remote possibility of neoplasia.2 Refusing to perform procedures involving radiation is often difficult to justify on grounds of risk alone, apart from in certain groups (for example, children and pregnant women). As the authors suggest, a partial solution to this problem may be to shield radiosensi tive tissues during the examination, a technique already widely practised for relatively low dose plain radiography. The reduction in patient dose by shielding radio sensitive organs during computed tomogra phy has been the subject of two papers.3 4 In our study, reductions in gonad dose of 77% and 82% were achieved during abdominal and pelvic scan protocols in a phantom by protecting the testes from scattered radia tion. The protection device, which retailed at less than ?100, did not impair image quality.3 We are currently carrying out a further study to examine the practicality and patient acceptability of this device in a busy tertiary referral centre. The current enthusiasm for computed tomography examinations continues una bated. Radiologists and referring clinicians must ensure that each patient receives maxi mum benefit from this invaluable imaging technique while minimising the attendant risks.
