Richmond* This experimental essay attempts to show how alternative methods and approaches are valuable in interrogating the ways in which orthodox theories of international relations (IR) approach peace. Drawing on a broad variety of critical traditions, it seeks to encourage the development of creative and experimental interdisciplinary approaches as well as to underline the deficiencies of more instrumentalist theories and methods. It especially tries to show how eclectic and experimental theories and methods produce sophisticated insights that are capable of reorienting analysis so as to respond to dynamics that must be understood if sustainable and multiple variations of peace are to emerge. Keywords: Dadaism, peace, différend, international relations, experi- mental eclecticism The life we led, our follies and our deeds of heroism, our provo- cations, however "polemical" and aggressive they may have been, were all part of a tireless quest for an anti-art, a new way of think- ing, feeling, and knowing. - Hans Richter, Dada: Art and Anti-Art1 Is IR theory antipeace? Certainly, for a long period any notion of peace has been submerged behind the debates about states, sover- eignty, institutions, norms, identity, and representation.2 On the institutionalization of this discipline after World War I it was hoped it would help discover a postwar peace dividend, especially through idealist and, later, liberal approaches. Whether this occurred is debatable. Certainly, orthodox analyses of international relations have failed in this respect, although they have been instrumental in developing a liberal discourse of peace since 1945, albeit one that has been as an expression of Western interests, rationalism, and cul- *School of International Relations and Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of St. Andrews, UK.

Even peace research has been criticized for having the poten- tial to become "a council of imperialism," further implicating the dis- cipline in the "tragedy" of international relations.3 This tendency is indicative of a "différend," a reminder that insti- tutions and frameworks may produce injustices even when operating in good faith.4 Many researchers interested in this problem often blame the "muscular objectivism"5 that has dominated the analysis of international relations in Western scholarship and policy. This has resulted in a narrow discipline, prone to lose sight of a broadly emancipatory notion of peace and insulating it from the contempo- rary culture wars that are raging across many other disciplines. The survival of the demand for reductionism and parsimony through "re- search" in liberal institutions without need for a broader ethical exploration is of especially great concern, given that methodological pluralism has become a generally accepted objective across many dis- ciplines as a way of avoiding parochialism.6 As with premodernist art, orthodox analyses of international relations represent the world mimetically, so that repetitions of the lessons of history become a self-fulfilling prophecy.7 In order to gain a multidimensional under- standing of international relations, this article argues, it will be nec- essary to embrace an ironic eclecticism in the manner of the Dadaists and of many other antimimetic approaches to representa- tion that recognize universal subjectivity, rather than trying to repli- cate an eternal truth or reality.8 Thus, in the context of various critical turns in the analysis of international relations, this article experiments with search, rather than research. It considers the implications of a genealogy of exam- ples engendering resistance to an accepted norm of, or institutional approach to, knowledge that has implications for a critical discussion of peace. It especially seeks to engage with orthodox claims to be able to interpret the "unknowable other,"9 while also opening up alternative perspectives that add previously hidden dimensions to a disciplinary discussion of peace. Using a collage of cases (in the per- formative sense of Dadaism),10 it illustrates how an approach based upon experimental eclecticism in method and theory can be used to contribute to a broader understanding of the key problems of inter- national relations.11 This allows for the juxtaposition of apparently unconnected events, issues, or dynamics in order to try to navigate around the différends to which independent events, issues, or dynamics have long been subject. Even an experimental and eclectic genealogy such as this pro- vides important theoretical and methodological insights into the problem of the différend generated by the dominance of a discourse</page><page sequence="3">Oliver P. Richmond 447 about international relations that lacks ambition beyond a negative form of peace, illustrating a failure to address social and political particularities and a tendency to assume dominant universal pat- terns. This article examines the evolution of these dynamics in the con- text of the (lack of) debate on peace in the analysis of international relations by juxtaposing a number of radical texts, movements, aes- thetic expressions, and thinkers so as to produce an account of peace and emancipation that also addresses the problem of the dif- férend.12 It develops and deploys Dadaism's an tiart/ antiwar move- ment in order to open up a discussion about a variety of other sources. It then turns to an investigation of those sources. They include the parable of Easter Island; Gilgamesh's attempt to defeat mortality; Beowulf's epic struggles; Tony Harrison's hyper real cri- tique of the Gulf War in his epic poem A Cold Coming, Nansen's asso- ciation of geographical exploration with humanitarianism; and pri- mate violence and culture. Finally, it outlines the benefits of such experimental eclecticism for the analysis of international relations. A "Dadaist Moment" Much of orthodox IR theory is antipeace because, with its emphasis on sovereignties, states, and institutions, it generally fails to deal with, or empathize with, everyday human life.13 Such reductionism might be useful in considering conflict in a Westphalian, state-cen- tric world, but it omits any consideration of other knowledge systems not local to the elites of the West or North.14 Indeed, orthodox IR's representational habits15 and knowledge systems explicitly isolate themselves to maintain their unity,16 at the expense of diverse issues of everyday life. This removes or deprioritizes such issues as culture, identity, gender, class, race, language, children, and the environ- ment by claiming to faithfully reproduce the "real" as something immutable. This means that IR theory replicates a discourse of vio- lence and war. Roland Bleiker and others have shown how the hege- monic mimetic representation that lies at the heart of orthodox IR theory is used to perpetuate its myths.17 Bleiker argues that "direct aesthetic encounters with the political can contribute to a more inclusive and just world order."18 A range of thinkers from Foucault to Deleuze effectively challenge the attempt of orthodox theory and methodology to represent and interpret through an appeal to a nar- row range of scientific approaches that mimic a hegemonic aesthetic and claims it as truth.</page><page sequence="4">448 Dadaism and the Peace Différend Such myths may be conducive to the claims of Western or liberal hegemony as well as mainstream theories of international relations, regardless of whether or not they arise purposefully or through the uncritical replication of biased or flawed knowledge systems. This is captured by Jean-Francois Lyotard's work on the "différend," which identifies the dilemmas of institutions and frameworks that produce injustice for their members or components even when operating in good faith and with consensus.19 They inevitably marginalize some participants as a consequence of the underlying ontological, episte- mological, and methodological assumptions and frameworks they represent and that inevitably favor participants with similar assump- tions. Feyerabend once rather flippantly called for a Dadaist moment in response to such restrictive dynamics: A Dadaist is convinced that a worthwhile life will arise only when we start taking things lightly, and when we remove from our speech the profound but already putrid meanings it has accumu- lated over the centuries ("search for the truth"; "fight for justice"; "passionate concern," etc.). And when he is prepared to initiate joyful experiments even in those domains where change and experimentation seem to be out of the question (example: the basic functions of language). I hope, therefore . . . the reader will remember me as a flippant Dadaist and not as a serious anar- chist.2O Feyerabend favored theoretical pluralism as a way of contending with representation and escaping the monotonous certainties and eternal truths sought by positivism. In a letter to Imre Lakatos and his writings "Against Method," he addressed exactly this problem of how formalism in method led to methodological rigidity and to ontological and epistemological assumptions that might lead to the failure of science. He argued that being deferential to concepts and ideas allowed them to gain their own structural existence, therefore creating bias in academic life. Along with many great artists and thinkers, Feyerabend faced intellectual resistance in his attempt at radical innovation in thought and epistemology. He responded with irony, cynicism, and humor. For him, Dadaism meant humor and an inability to be deferential to concepts and ideas that had gained a life and a seriousness of their own. The Dadaists of the early twentieth century aspired toward "antiart" as a response to what were seen as stifling conventions and formalism that they felt inhibited an embrace of change, develop- ment, and new technologies. Dadaists opposed convention,</page><page sequence="5">Oliver P. Richmond 449 attempted to develop radically new approaches, accepted the politi- cal nature of art, and resisted the acceptance of war and violence. Dadaism (and later surrealism) emerged at a time of great stress and change in the period during and after World War I.21 It emerged in Zurich- "the peaceful dead centre of the war" - at the Cabaret Voltaire22 and, through intellectual contacts and minor publications, spread to Paris, Berlin, and New York. This avowedly antiwar move- ment was appalled by the recent war. Hans Arp, a member of the Zurich Dada movement, wrote: Revolted by the butchery of the 1914 World War, we in Zurich devoted ourselves to the arts. While the guns rumbled in the dis- tance, we sang, painted, made collages, and wrote poems with all our might. We were seeking an art based on fundamentals to cure the madness of the age, and a new order of things that would restore the balance between heaven and hell. We had a dim pre- monition that power-mad gangsters would one day use art itself as a way of deadening men's minds.23 Dadaism represented many attempts to disrupt forever a formal way of thinking, a belief in scientific progress as always positive, and a dialectic driven only by power, which some felt had led to the hor- rors of the war. Ironically, Hans Richter, one of the founders of the movement (according to his own account), said that the relative freedom of Zurich even during the war benefited Lenin (who lived opposite Cabaret Voltaire) and his friends; indeed, the Swiss author- ities were more suspicious of the Dadaists than of the Communists, who were at that very moment fomenting world revolution.24 Out of this maelstrom of imagination, social and political comment, radical rejectionism, and antifoundationalism was born an antinationalist, internationalist, and unsettling movement that influenced some of the most significant experimental writers, thinkers, and artists of the twentieth century. Founded in 1916 and defunct by the early 1920s, Dadaism laid the way for surrealism to open up the debate of the multiple ways in which what was real could be investigated and represented beyond the romantic or realist realism of more traditional expressions.25 Through its experimentation with events, chance, installations, mobiles, collages, phonetic poems, and film, and more generally through attempts to disorientate and disrupt the expected medium and matter of art, it showed how the real was simply an interest-based hegemonic representation. It was designed to "bring home to the bourgeois the unreality of his world and the emptiness of all his endeavours, even including his profitable nationalism."26</page><page sequence="6">450 Dadaism and the Peace Différend Dadaism's key figures, such as Duchamp and Picabia, explored the paradoxes and modes of representation against the backdrop of the chaos provided by the war. Indeed, although it was a reaction to the chaos induced by the war, it also often reveled in it, reflecting the fractured nature of the contemporary context where exhilarating opportunities coexisted with catastrophe. It was concerned with artistic innovation that would reflect social and political radicalism.27 For example, as painting had now dispensed with the object, so poetry could "discard language."28 Dadaism was defined by its attempt to challenge and reformulate, to unsettle and innovate. First, however, a "final dissolution" was required. As Walter Serner put it, This dissolution was the ultimate in everything that Dada repre- sented, philosophically and morally; everything must be pulled apart, not a screw left in its customary place, the screw-holes wrenched out of shape, the screw, like man himself, set on its way towards new functions which could only be known after the total negation of everything that had existed before. Until then: riot, destruction, defiance, confusion. The role of chance, not as an extension of the scope of art, but as a principle of dissolution and anarchy. In art, anti-art.29 This was a powerful statement against complacent and aggres- sive modes of discourse and of the Dadaists' desire to move away from art as "industry" toward something more meaningful in response to the ethical predicaments of the time.30 Another mem- ber, Hugo Ball, regarded as one of the fathers of Dada, wrote that "Dada regarded [heroic] art as an adventure of liberated humanity," aimed at a "new and universal consciousness."31 In a characteristic contribution, Johannes Baader (self-styled Oberdada) proclaimed himself "president of the globe" in his Dadaist Manifesto. He dis- rupted the inaugural meeting of the National Assembly at Weimar and demanded that government be handed over to Dadaists.32 How different the world might have been. Dadaism quickly became famous because it often adopted a directly provocative tone with its audience; in fact, insulting the audi- ence was a common practice. This was often an aesthetic and anar- chistic representation of the human and political challenge, not just of rebuilding Europe but also of constructing a peace that would be self-sustaining. Dadaism was never far from anarchism, with its focus upon chance as a method of representation, and what Richter has described as "excesses . . . insolence, insulting behaviour, pointless acts of defiance, fictitious duels, riots."33 Indeed, this was a response</page><page sequence="7">Oliver P. Richmond 451 to the key question as to whether the "chance" that often led to Dadaist art was in fact the unconscious mind or an external power at work, directing the outcome of their artistic experiments, and that in turn led to an energization of their art in these previously unex- plored fields. The Dadaist movement has had broad implications for the devel- opment of different approaches within representational art and its relationship with politics and society. As with any revolutionary moment, Dadaism eventually entered the mainstream itself, though its images (like those of surrealism) remain challenging representa- tions, and it has been deeply influential for other movements. Yet, Dadaism itself needed Dadaism in order to avoid stagnation and its own différend. In particular, Dadaism contributed to the surrealist "revolution" of the likes of Ernst, Dali, and Miro, in which uncommon associa- tions and representations would shed new light on old problems, issues, and dynamics, and on the irrationality of human nature. Indeed, surrealism was aimed at erasing a distinction between art and a claimed reality, allowing for exploration rather than simply accepting what had gone before as eternally definitive. While per- haps intimating naivety, as some might call painting while the guns roared, Dadaism was often associated with a dangerous anarchism, as Feyerabend points out, and alternative approaches are now often similarly accused. But Feyerabend was clear that anarchism was cold and uninterested in human lives or happiness except for a chosen few.34 Both Dadaism and surrealism appealed to a left-wing audience and to their notions of solidarity, and it opened concerns about gen- der and race through its concern with liberty.35 It also contributed to a new, mainstream, institution in art. Yet, Dadaism was about the rediscovery of the individual and his or her contexts and experi- ences, through a new methodology, rather than the elevation of an overarching orthodoxy that was to define the individual according to a specific and predetermined hierarchy. It represented an attempt to push back boundaries rather than to prove their sanctity and to open up the question of representation itself in an area where many thought its nature had long been settled. It was only one of such movements that were initiated as a reaction to World War I and to traditional formalism, but it was very explicit in its linkages between the two, and in its experimentation. Many Dadaists (and later surrealists) were pacifists, or at least were antiwar. Similarly, many critical thinkers have some sympathy for Marxist-derived critiques of liberalism (though aware of the damning critiques of revolutionary violence, dialectics, and instru- mentalism, and of those that Baudrillard and others level against</page><page sequence="8">452 Dadaism and the Peace Différend Marxist accounts of human subjects who realize themselves only through labor) ,36 but even so they are strongly influenced by a nor- mative revulsion of war, oppression, exploitation, and domination. Indeed, the notion of antiart and a rejection of the formulas that had gone before provide an apposite analogy with shifts that have occurred in international relations as it has become more interdisci- plinary and critically oriented. There is, of course, a limit to the claims one can make about Dadaism, and its development also points to warnings for interna- tional relations. Although Dadaism was an internationalist, avant- garde movement that was a reaction against nationalism, its expres- sion often adopted a humanist and universalizing tone despite its criticism of universalizing humanisms. It also ultimately became an antihumanist movement, developing the theme of man-as-machine and taking an ambiguous position on the Cartesian subject/object distinction in some cases; essentially, it also reflected a Westernized intellectual agenda associated with modernity and modernization. It has since been accused of popularizing banality and becoming an institution itself.37 What is clear about Dadaism is that its impulses have filtered into mainstream modes of contemporary representation. It is indicative of the potential of even such radical approaches to help renew and enervate a narrow discipline and have a much wider impact on the world, in the context of contemporary events and issues. The Dadaists' attacks on convention, notions of progress and rationality, nationalism, and authority have had a lasting impact. What is more, such radical agendas, based upon nonrational responses, often ten- uously interpreted, caused an evaluation of what had gone before, challenged the institutionalization of art, and revolutionized its future development. This has had a broad-ranging effect far beyond the art world. Other Examples of Resistance to War After 1918 There are many other famous examples of artistic resistance to war and orthodoxy and a concern with peace. The Bloomsbury group was another such example, spanning both world wars. Keynes was a key member, along with T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf.38 Keynes wrote presciently of the Paris Peace Treaty, "The peace is outrageous and impossible and can bring nothing but misfortune."39 This was not a "good peace" but a "Carthaginian Peace" that would destroy Europe.40 Later, in a similar vein, a group of surrealists around Andre Breton, a key proponent of Dada, published a manifesto enti-</page><page sequence="9">Oliver P. Richmond 453 tied "Neither Your War nor Your Peace" in response to the 1938 Munich Agreement and attacked the "justifiers of war" and the "fal- sifiers of peace" in equal measure.41 Later this consensus began to break up because the group was torn in different directions by some members' support for the Algerian war of independence against France, support for the Soviet Union, and disgust over the invasion of Hungary in 1956. Many such movements or individuals were also associated with the developing liberal-internationalist movement, which was seen as a way around the old problems of war, self-interest, and greed. These revolutionary dynamics and representations were controversial at the time. Keynes, for example, was accused of appeasement because of his attack on the Treaty of Versailles as being far too punitive, this being a common orthodox response to attempts to favor an ambi- tious peace on the grounds that it mean negotiating with, or capitu- lating to, incorrigible enemies.42 An extreme response was Hitler's infamous exhibition on "degenerate art," which toured Germany in 1937-1938 and attempted to show that radical modes of representa- tion were inferior to the preexisting orthodoxy. Books by Thomas Mann and Sigmund Freud, among others, were burned. Paintings by Picasso and Kandinsky, among many others, were confiscated from galleries as part of this Nazi campaign, which was suffused by a romantic notion of the volk and an underlying strategic ontology of power (which provided its own legitimacy in the eyes of totalitarians, Nazis, and fascists alike).43 The significance of representation and the possibilities for conflict between traditional and contemporary formats was clearly recognized by all parties in this dispute. Their dis- pute was over the objectification of the subjective aesthetic and the use of restricted methods in order to prevent critiques of long-held assumptions and knowledge. Yet resistance to hegemonic and mimetic representations continued. Felix Nussbaum, a Jewish-but- secular painter who died in a Nazi concentration camp, produced an antiwar painting called The Pearl in 1938 using the classic represen- tation of Virgin and Child with subtle alterations to make an explicit antiwar assertion. Later, as Hitler's Nazis pursued him, Nussbaum began to paint images of himself in hiding, representing himself as an orthodox Jew even though he had never thought of himself as such.44 Later, during World War II, many artists used representations of the effects of German aggression to bolster support against Nazism, particularly in the United States.45 Picasso's famous painting Guernica laid the way for this through its representation of horror at the first aerial bombing of the Basque town of that name, indicative of this challenge to realism in art and politics. As did many artists, Picasso became strongly involved in</page><page sequence="10">454 Dadaism and the Peace Différend opposition to war through art. The bleak symbolism of Guernica and its depiction of the Nazi/Franco-ist destruction of the small Basque town was hailed as a modernist representation of the inhumanity of mechanized war. The painting was understood as a cry for peace abroad, but in Spain it was seen as sedition by the Franco elites. Reputedly, a German officer once asked Picasso, "Did you do that?" with reference to Guernica, to which Picasso replied, "No, you did." Indeed, he once said "painting is not done to decorate apartments. It is an instrument of war,"46 which underlines art as representation, rather than presentation. Yet, Picasso denied there was any symbol- ism at all involved in the painting; it simply represented "what is." In other words, subjective representation cannot not be delegitimated by claimed objectivity. The travails of this painting became con- nected intimately with the democratization of Franco's Spain at Picasso's request: the painting could not be returned from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it had been placed for safe keeping, until Spain had become a democracy (it was returned, after Franco's death, in 1981), and he himself became associated with resistance to states and their war machines.47 Like Dadaists, he was against the logic of war and violence and resisted the orthodox- ies of art. He was also against being described as a surrealist, effec- tively insisting (like Feyerabend) that he was against all form in his attempt to express interpretations of the world around him: "Some people call my work for a period 'surrealism.' I am not a surrealist. I have never been out of reality. If someone wished to express war it might be more elegant and literary to make a bow and arrow because that is more aesthetic, but for me, if I want to express war, I'll use a machine gun!"48 In 1952 Picasso drew (on a napkin over dinner) the famous dove that became a symbol of the peace move- ment (he also became a communist and was twice awarded the Lenin Prize for Peace) . Like Picasso, Einstein, whose life and scientific work made him able to comment both on the situation in Palestine and the devel- opment of the atom bomb, was also concerned with the problem of peace. Toward the end of his life, he was associated with the cam- paign to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and he is often attrib- uted an interest in the progress of what was then the new state of Israel, the problems of Zionism, and the "Palestinian problem." In particular he is associated with a famous letter written by a group of scientists protesting and opposing the use of nuclear weapons (though he had earlier been instrumental in lobbying for the Manhattan Project).49</page><page sequence="11">Oliver P. Richmond 455 Dadaism in International Relations: Beyond the Différend? It has long been widely argued by many IR theorists that one of the key challenges facing the analysis of international relations today is to open itself up to interdisciplinarity and its ensuing implications. This would, it is suggested, qualitatively improve the nature of peace that IR theory implicitly promotes.50 Orthodox theory assumes that it presents the international, whereas more critical approaches indi- cate that presentation is merely representation and seek to open up the broader implications of this for both the way orthodox interna- tional relations theorizes the international and how it might be pos- sible to move beyond the weaknesses that this uncovers.51 Underlying Dadaism was this very argument: that claims of presen- tation were dangerous and allowed lazy and self-defeating assump- tions of eternal truth to afflict both knowledge and the future and, more importantly, the everyday lives of individuals. From an elite and official perspective, this allowed for dispassionate decisions for the greatest good, although what Dadaists saw instead was domina- tion and stagnation leading to the greatest loss for ordinary people. Such ontologies created epistemes and methods for the analysis of international relations that rested upon the historically and strategi- cally conditioned, rational, and positivist assumptions that peace was limited, that coercion and even violence might be justified, and that nonintervention even in cases of serious need could be tolerated. In this context, liberal, democratic, and neoliberal forms of governance and their representation crucial for peace was seen to be an impor- tant advance. Yet, even this advance underlines how orthodox IR theory is sub- ject to a différend in regard to peace. This is derived from the claim to be able to legitimately interpret the other with little input from that other. The problems this causes have often been responded to in the context of critical discussions of emancipation, often associ- ated with peace.52 Yet even the debates on emancipation cover a familiar terrain and often require an external progenitor, definer, and defender. What emancipation actually means is strongly con- tested, particularly in the context of self-emancipation.53 Those intellectuals, academics, artists, and policymakers who become interested in the problem of peace are sensitive to the dynamics of the différend. Dadaists, Picasso, Einstein, and Feyerabend are all examples of this sensitivity and of a subsequent advocacy response through their different media. Analysts of inter-</page><page sequence="12">456 Dadaism and the Peace Différend national relations who have become associated with thinking on peace often offer radically alternatives to the orthodoxy as a result of this sensitivity. Orthodox IR theory focuses by contrast on the iden- tification of epochal or key moments that define an approach vali- dating war as a tool for peace. World War I, World War II, the "end of the Cold War," and "9/11" were such defining moments. World War I provoked a variety of responses, from pacifism and disarma- ment movements to antiart, Dadaism, and surrealism to fascism and militarism. In IR theory, it provoked a spurt of thinking about war and peace, which led to the so-called first great debate between real- ism and idealism, in which, until World War II and E. H. Carr's influ- ential account of "the twenty years' crisis," idealism held the upper hand. World War II produced a rationalist reliance on international liberal institutionalism, a conflict between neoliberalism, freedom, and equality, that formed a hierarchy in which behavior was enabled as well as regulated through external governance, where responsi- bility ended with militarily and economically powerful states. The end of the cold war brought a'n liberal moment" in which the hege- mony of liberal governance was to provide a utopia for neoliberal democracies. The 9/11 attacks have seen a resurgence of a more mil- itaristic version of the liberal governance project as well as the return of the state and its claimed sovereignty. This dynamic is representa- tive of the elitist and formulaic decadence that Dadaism resisted. Orthodox IR theory is resistant to such an agenda. While inter- national relations is continually theorized, it is not often contextual- ized, partly because of the hold of reductionist historical theoretical conventions. To the extent that it is contextualized it is usually with- out much regard for its human, social, emotive, aesthetic, or cultural context. Consequently, power can be exercised rationally through the coercive and bureaucratic administration of human life in return for the benefits derived from contact with the executors of power. Such modes of thought are seductive within an ontological and epis- temological framework offered by unreflective rationalism, where norms, ethics, and everyday life are deemed to be of a lesser priority than state and strategic interests, but they are repulsive to the criti- cal impulse toward sophisticated forms of peace with which interna- tional relations could engage. IR theory has rarely engaged overtly with its own responsibility for issues that may have arisen in practice. There has been little sense that IR theory might be partly to blame for many problems, from war to terrorism, to intervention, migration, refugees, or failed state-building/peace-building. Being caught up in the institutional problems of politics and the subsequent inertias created by its asso- ciations with an acceptance of "what is" in both domestic and inter-</page><page sequence="13">Oliver P. Richmond 457 national settings require a pragmatic attitude toward "what is." This is exactly what Feyerabend was resisting, and what Lyotard argued could result only in injustice. Of course, a discipline develops through the decisions of academics, journals, professional associa- tions, conference organizers, publishers, university management, and funding agencies. Indeed, in the light of this list of intervening factors, neither the individual academic nor the ever-changing con- text are to be considered to be overriding factors. Though many are in favor of theoretical pluralism, the orthodoxies of methodological rigor constrain what is legitimate for research, how it is done, and what kinds of questions are asked. Dadaism's attempt to rip art asunder, to contextualize, often in terms of the horrors of everyday life, and of World War I, developed in order to break free of what were seen as stifling and constraining conventions. It rejected disciplinary boundaries as not just limiting but dangerous, particularly for the everyday. Just as Marcel Duchamps's Fountain - a "ready-made" object, a urinal - exposed some aspects of art as trickery,54 so critical theories have exposed many ways in which orthodox international relations rests on highly contentious assumptions that have nonetheless been made to seem credible. The story of Dadaism as antiart, as a response to formal tra- ditional modes of artistic expression, and as an interpretation of con- text, particularly World War I and its uncertain aftermath, shows how creativity, imagination, theorization and context can be brought together in productive and fascinating ways to overcome the différ- end. To seize this opportunity means seizing the constructive lessons offered by Dadaism as a brief genre that laid the foundations for what are now very mainstream genres. Experimental Eclecticism in International Relations One of the lessons noted above of the various reactions against what had gone before, and in the context of World War I, was the need to draw on a wider variety of influences and approaches. It was impor- tant not just to challenge method and theory but also the basic assumptions that had long lain unchallenged, and any sense of an orthodoxy, tradition, or of formalism. Presentation was to be rethought as representation55 in order to accept that truth is choice, reality is a social construction, conceptual frameworks may produce self-fulfilling prophecies, and identity and identification are always potentially open to abuse.56 Following Lyotard, among many others, communities came to be understood as creating their own mean- ing.57 Following Baudrillard, simulation came to be understood as a</page><page sequence="14">458 Dadaism and the Peace Différend consequence of theorizing.58 All these themes have been taken up by some theorists of international relations to great effect.59 Such per- spectives allow for the exploration of alternative sites of knowledge, utilizing an eclectic and creative methodology. Drawing on the prior account of a Dadaist mode of experimental eclecticism, several issues and objects providing alternative sources for enhancing knowledge and understanding in international relations may be juxtaposed. Ambiguous Realism and Three Epic Poems The genre of heroic poetry provides some of the foundational texts in the Western canon on war and peace, spanning Gilgamesh, the Iliad, and Beowulf, among others. In particular, Gilgamesh and Beowulf provide a fertile ground to examine the range of debates on the international and to show that there have long been critical posi- tions pushing far beyond the imagination of liberalism and realism. In these texts, violence of a random nature, relating to organized war, or simply to invasion, rape, and pillage, is taken for granted, yet also some perennial themes emerge relating to tragic heroism and the defense of the homestead, the problem of mortality and order in the creation of a sustainable institutions, and the existential issues associated with normative and critical approaches. The Sumerian epic Gilgamesh, dating from about 2700 b.c., relates how a semimortai man travels beyond his city state of Uruk, of which he is king, in what appears to be an existential voyage in search of immortality.60 Gilgamesh is the strongest king on earth, two-thirds god and one-third human, but also he abuses his own peo- ple. He travels with his wild friend Enkidu to the Cedar Forest, lead- ing to a battle in which they defeat the demon guardian of the trees, during which Gilgamesh becomes afraid for the first time. However, they next fight and kill the "bull of heaven," and the gods take revenge for this by killing Enkidu. Bitterly, Gilgamesh then sets out to avoid Enkidu' s fate in a search for his own missing immortality. However, in a series of adventures involving a search for an herb that is supposed to provide immortality, the herb is stolen by a snake (representing evil). Chastened, Gilgamesh is forced to accept his fate as a mortal man and return to Uruk. This was one of the earliest recorded exploratory journeys. Gilgamesh was left in the predicament of a mortal man, faced with the ultimate voyage into the unknown (death) despite being partly a god and a king by birth. For Gilgamesh, defeating death was vital for both personal and political reasons.61 That Gilgamesh infers a politi- cally sophisticated state, and state of being,62 is important in illus- trating the search for the causes and responses to conflict. From this</page><page sequence="15">Oliver P. Richmond 459 earliest of texts it is apparent that city-states exist in a world similar to that imagined by Hobbes or Machiavelli; that leaders thought themselves to deserve divinity and therefore to rule by divine right, and that self-interest overruled a desire for cooperation. This tragic epic story reflects the story of the international milieu seen from the perspective of leaders who are paternalist, jealous, and fearful. That such thinking still characterizes so much IR theory is a mystery, given the early lesson learned by Gilgamesh, that such a path leads to dis- aster. The political motivation of orthodox IR theory is much like Gilgamesh' s search for the herb that would make him completely immortal, while his [existential] journey and its setbacks mirror the so-called emancipatory strands of theorizing that seek to set interna- tional relations free from the constraints of orthodox assumptions. In Gilgamesh, all of this is wrapped in mythological terms, which were to be passed down to serve as instruction, a warning, and a memor- ial. The text was lost for thousands of years, being rediscovered only in the twentieth century by archaeologists on dispersed and buried tablets, which even now are still being reassembled and translated. The fact that Gilgamesh was lost and only recently rediscovered serves as a reminder of alternative locations of knowledge, but also of its fragility and mortality. Beowulf continues similar epic themes,63 although in an alto- gether more familiar environment (it dates from about 700 A.D.). While Gilgamesh could be a parable purely from imagination, Beowulf is part of Anglo-Saxon consciousness (inspiring Tolkien, among many others), in which the home, great hall, and village is sacred and sovereign and a threat to a kingdom is a threat to home and a threat to a home is a threat to a kingdom. Beowulf is called upon to undertake acts of extreme heroism in order to defeat a horrific threat in three great battles. In the first two battles he defeats his foes at the very last moment in epic struggles. As a result he is made king. The political themes dealt with in Beowulf revolve around the ambi- guity of good and evil, fear of the enemy and an unknown and unpredictable threat, difficulty in physically locating the enemy, and the ease with which the enemy can be identified as the other. The violation of the home opens up the debate about security and the need to make sacrifices in terms of personal freedoms in order to defend one's values, home, and person. The fluid nature of the enemy make the struggle all the more tense and dangerous. The ambiguity of Beowulf's Christian and pagan themes opens up the dilemma of the normative system upon which Beowulf acts. This is never satisfactorily resolved in the text, though what is clear is that good and evil, the rigid differentiation between them, and the pro- tection of home are paramount. This was an early form of territorial</page><page sequence="16">460 Dadaism and the Peace Différend sovereignty. Even so, little can be done to prevent the tragedy of Beowulf s death in his later, final, defensive, battle, when he kills the dragon that deals him a mortal blow, reflecting the tragedy of con- flicting sovereign claims that mark orthodox international relations. Even though he was the most humane of all knights, the mildest, gentlest, and most heroic, the path he took led to death and loss. A more recent contribution to this canon of tragic-heroic litera- ture subverts the heroic delineation between good and evil that Beowulf and Gilgamesh play with even further. In Tony Harrison's A Cold Coming,^ a dead Iraqi soldier is heroized ironically during the Gulf War not so much for his achievements but for his relative poverty and powerlessness in the face of the US military machine. The poem takes the form of a conversation between a dead Iraqi sol- dier killed during a US attack on a convoy and a US soldier. The Iraqi is heroized not for what he achieved in life (for obviously, he has been defeated and slain) but by the comparison made between the technologically advanced US soldiers who, before leaving for bat- tle, have been able to secure their immortality with the help of a sperm bank. Thus, ontological security is guaranteed. The Iraqi sol- dier subverts this through a telling comparison with his own, far more deprived situation in life as well as in death. His war, he points out, has entailed a greater, darker, existential fear than that of the US soldiers. Their "cold coming" guaranteed them security; for the dead Iraqi soldier there was no chance of immortality. Harrison's poem sheds light on the inequality of war and the ways in which nor- mative differentiations can so easily be broken down to subvert the traditional understanding of good and evil associated with victors and vanquished. "Just war" in this sense works only at the level of the state's defense of its ideational hegemony, rather than at the every- day level of individuals and groups: I saw the charred Iraqi lean towards me from bomb-blasted screen His windscreen wiper like a pen ready to write down thoughts for men His windscreen wiper like a quill he's reaching for to make his will . . . Rainbows seven shades of black curved from Kuwait back to Iraq And instead of gold the frozen crock's crammed with Mankind on the rock The congealed genie who won't thaw until the World renounces War.65 A Cold Coming reverses the heroization of the victor with the defeated. Gilgamesh likewise debunks the heroization of the quest for immortality and underlines its tragedy. This is also reflected in</page><page sequence="17">Oliver P. Richmond 461 Beowulf. For Harrison this has come full circle, with war no longer being an epic struggle for values but merely representing the inequality and hegemony that marks the contemporary world. War is now demeaning, unheroic, and pointless. Even its "just" nature is a simple charade ignoring the individual in favor of the hegemonic state and the defense of territory. For Gilgamesh and Beowulf, immortality and security meant sovereignty. Sovereignty is a com- promise with immortality; even just and defensive wars are tragic, and contemporary "just wars" perhaps disguise powerful underlying injustices and violence. Easter Island as a Tragic Parable The archaeological record combined with inductive research sug- gests at the very least the establishment of a cult on Easter Island, a remote island some two thousand miles from Chile.66 This is related to the many stone statues on the island, positioned looking out across the sea, and it is generally thought that their obsessive construction led to the exhaustion of the natural resources that supported the inhabitants of the island.67 According to an orthodox view, an artistic and existential quest to escape the bitter realities of local politics exacerbated the tragedy of Easter Island. The use of wood to build and move the statues denuded the island, led to soil erosion, and a collapse of food production. The use of manpower for this purpose probably also affected food production. Civil war broke out, and there is some evidence of a resort to cannibalism on the part of some of Easter Island's inhabitants, and the situation escalated, undermin- ing food supplies and human security more generally.68 Though this interpretation is heavily contested, disciplines that consider the study of Easter Island as central, such as archaeology and anthropology, see it as a parable for the world's environmental situation and states' propensity toward large-scale violence.69 Certainly, since the first European inhabitation by missionaries on the island in 1864, it has been commonplace to make such observa- tions. What is particularly unusual about Easter Island, is that before its collapse, the record suggests, contrary to the ubiquity of territor- ial conflict in Polynesia there seems to have been a millennia of peace. Yet, by the late 1770s, warriors had taken control and the island became divided between two loosely tied groups from east and west. There are several different hypotheses about the final crisis and the self-destruction of the island - ranging from cultural isolation, immigration, and climate change to deforestation due to statue building and food exhaustion - leading to the parallel of the island</page><page sequence="18">462 Dadaism and the Peace Différend as a microcosm for the planet.70 In this isolated context, the polity collapsed in on itself and left behind symbols of a longing to escape, even though they did not have anywhere to escape to. The reasons for the cult of the stone statues are not fully clear, but it is supposed that the position overlooking the open sea indicates a desire on the part of the inhabitants to leave the island, although there is no record about whether there existed any cultural memory of any other land mass beyond the island itself. These famous statues rep- resent not just a sense that there must be something better beyond the oceans, but also a self-awareness and reflexivity. Easter Island can be read as an apocalyptic parable for orthodox IR theory. It represents an awareness that there may be better possi- bilities compared with the present, but also a tragic resignation often derived from self-imposed reductionism and an ontological reliance on debates about the inherent violence of human nature and states. As this debate continues, orthodox international relations is con- ducted in a minimalist way so as to preserve stability, but not to achieve a more ambitious agenda. As on the Titanic, the band plays on. Of course, this interpretation of Easter Island's collapse rests upon a realist ontology and a piecing together of very scant evi- dence, as Peiser has argued, reflecting cultural and environmental pessimism and determinism.71 In other words, this is mainly inter- pretation, as with the orthodoxy associated with the main texts of international relations. In this vein, it is thought that many of the statues were purposefully toppled and beheaded in the final trauma of war that overtook the island. In a fine and tragic hyperbole, the island's society probably collapsed into civil war, cannibalism, and environmental disaster. Its final irony, echoing the ruined cities of World War II, or what might have remained had there been a third such war, are the beautiful, eerie statues, left gazing sadly and long- ingly seaward toward the horizon. They were an early indication of the différend of orthodox international relations. IR theory has addressed the Peloponnesian War, or the Melian Dialogue, primarily because those conflicts conform to its rigorous requirements of states, hegemons, and victors and losers in a war. Yet, the parable of Easter Island has been ignored because it does not conform to that canon, and of course it represents a war in which there are only losers. If Easter Island's lessons had been learned, orthodox inter- national relations would have had to respond to the ephemeral nature of the victor's peace that it often disguises. Even so, "Whatever may have happened in the past on Easter Island, whatever they did to their island themselves, it totally pales into insignificance compared to the impact that was going to come through Western contact."72</page><page sequence="19">Oliver P. Richmond 463 Linking Exploration and Humanitarianism Nansen, the great Norwegian explorer, was the first to drift a ship across the Arctic ice sheet in search of the North Pole (1893-1896). This provided the basis for Amundsen's later feats in which he famously beat an ill-prepared Scott to the South Pole in 1911. Nansen was a scientist, a diplomat, and a humanitarian, and eventu- ally came to equate exploration and its scientific contribution with humanitarianism and the search for peace after World War I.73 He was instrumental in the development of the Norwegian state as an independent entity and also worked for the League of Nations, becoming a champion of its conflict-resolution capacities. He made the link between the development of scientific knowledge about the world and its environment and the desire for this sort of exploration to aid in the pacification of relations between the world's polities, which he came to see as necessary if knowledge was to be further developed. He saw war as a major obstacle to the development of sci- ence through exploration and humanitarianism as a necessary con- dition for establishing a peaceful course of development, so enhanc- ing the quest for knowledge.74 This raises the question of an ethical basis for knowledge pro- duction, and in particular whether a discipline should adopt a prag- matic/empirical approach limited to representing the real as flawed and probably unchanging or should also attempt to advocate and model a better future as both a process and goal. For Nansen the lat- ter was crucial, reflecting his belief in what might be termed a posi- tive epistemology of peace,75 and much of his work in the realm of international relations, both with the negotiations for Norwegian independence from Sweden in 1905 and for refugees after World War I, reflected this. Indeed, as a result, in his capacity as League of Nations high commissioner for refugees from 1921, he created the Nansen Passport, which was eventually recognized by many of the world's governments. It is estimated (though not without some con- troversy) that with the Red Cross he also helped save millions of peo- ple (between 7 and 22 million of them) who were starving in the Russian famine of 1921, and he was also involved in the negotiations between the Greek and Turkish governments over the Treaty of Lausanne and the subsequent population exchange. His was a direct challenge to the acceptance of the supposed ontological tragedy of international relations. Similar challenges can also be seen in Gerhard Mercator's approach to cartography. His new approach to territorial mapping developed in 1569 allowed mariners to plot journeys at sea with a straight line on a map by building the curvature of the earth's sur-</page><page sequence="20">464 Dadaism and the Peace Différend face into his two-dimensional mapping technique. Mercator recog- nized that the exploration of the sea and coastlines going on at that time both demanded and allowed for improved mapping tech- niques. He reinterpreted the "real" geography of the world without ever having seen the places he mapped, using materials collected from other maps and writings and also by interviewing seafarers. This eventually led to both a theoretical and practical revolution in navigating the world that placed the navigator, rather than the map- maker, at the center of attention, thus reflecting the needs of those who actually used maps. Even so, his approach was not adopted for a long time after his death, despite its obvious benefits, because of wide resistance to any radical change, regardless of its good sense.76 Both Mercator and Nansen made intellectual connections that transcended the accepted rote. Nansen realized that the physical and scientific exploration of the world indicated the necessity of a humanitarian response to political failures to enable the former and transcend the latter. In doing so, he tried to address the issues that arose during war for ordinary people. Likewise, Mercator realized that the experiences of ordinary mariners could be collated and applied, allowing him to transcend the limitations of physical explo- ration and produce maps that would be of direct use to them. Nansen helped change the world's political map and civil expecta- tions, while Mercator literally mapped the world through the eyes of others without ever leaving his war-battered part of northern Europe. Both contributed to an elevation of the everyday in their particular sphere, while at the same time creating conceptual and institutional formats that reflected this, rather than privileging more traditional interests. Primates and "Machiavellian Intelligence" While orthodox international relations neither necessarily provides "privileged knowledge" nor has found it necessary to move beyond its so-called immutable truths, a recent development in research on primates has challenged it in some of these areas. The argument that violence is integral to human nature, commonly accepted, is partly derived from observations of the so-called "state of nature" and the animal world, and it has been discredited.77 Yet, the human "natural proclivity" for violence is often assumed to be closely related to the propensity of primates toward extreme violence for basic survival. It is clear that primates have the capacity to commit proportionate "Machiavellian" acts, showing a sentience normally reserved for humans, but this does not solely define the character of their com- munities.78 However, primates have developed social organization</page><page sequence="21">Oliver P. Richmond 465 and hierarchies designed to realize survival and basic interests with- out, where possible, resorting to violence. Many primatologists now argue that nurture, not nature, defines primate culture, and they look with amusement upon the tendency to make such assumptions about the "natural world."79 What is more, many primatologists are aghast at the broad tendency to draw comparisons between species, that portray a very monodimensional, androcentric view of the world.80 Primates are now thought to have their own forms of culture, andprobably of language, and to be capable of complex emotions and the intelligent use of tools. In particular, they are aware of the problems of using violence and have developed sophisticated peace- making techniques.81 They are neither randomly violent because of instinct in a Darwinian sense nor mainly sedentary and pacific. There is growing evidence (from both the primate world and ethno- graphers working with so-called primitive societies) that peacemak- ing is just as intrinsic as violence, and furthermore that the capacity for violence is always met with a capacity for peacemaking.82 Indeed, it is now widely documented that "reconciliation" occurs in parts of the primate world.83 There is even speculation that some primate communities have developed a kind of religion, or at least a norma- tive framework. Researchers conducting such projects have been accused of anthropomorphism, that is, of projecting human qualities onto pri- mates. This has some important implications for international rela- tions, which itself is often anthropomorphic, projecting supposedly human qualities - relating to specific groups of humans - onto states, structures, and groups, as well as onto primates. These quali- ties are often taken to be rooted in and endorsed by a natural pro- clivity toward self-interest and violence, mitigated only by basic levels of social organizations of states and related peoples. If primates are not merely instinctive and self-seeking animals and reserve their so- called Machiavellian intelligence84 traits for moments of extremity - if they are in fact caring, cultured, and aesthetically able - then the age-old argument on which crude realist-liberalism is based, that vio- lence is innate, requiring disciplinary institutional governance to contain it, must be jettisoned, along with much of the edifice of orthodox IR theory. If caring and culture is innate to and learned by primates - our closest living relatives - showing that primates are in effect normatively and socially constructed, then arguments about the state of nature and the tragic view of politics cannot be sustained. The growing acknowledgment of the sophisticated nature of animal societies and their crucial roles in both producing and ameliorating conflict85 indicates instead that a more plausible analogy between</page><page sequence="22">466 Dadaism and the Peace Différend primates and humans is that social, political, and communicative frameworks for the avoidance of violence and for mutual care are the predominant characteristics of both international relations and primate groups. A Dadaist Moment for International Relations Far from attempting to contribute to a "peace dividend," orthodox IR theory represents a "peace différend." Gilgamesh, Beowulf, the case of Easter Island, and A Cold Coming make it clear that this is privi- leged knowledge, telling only part of the story of peace and war. Research on primates underlines how Darwinist views of innate vio- lence are far from providing a full picture. Scientists, explorers, and researchers from many other disciplines have long noted that peace is effectively too important to rest on eternal assumptions, but requires radical turns of thought. Indeed, a long succession of schol- ars have contributed to a movement, similar to that of the Dadaists, within international relations that has become the mechanism by which peace, culture, identity, and everyday life are reinserted into its emerging orthodoxies. With this in mind, experimental eclecti- cism indicates that to produce an empathetic and emancipatory understanding of the everyday aspects of peace in ordinary life, the following might be considered: • A broad range of theories, methods, and sources can be used comparatively in order to provide multiple readings of what may appear to be disconnected phenomena • Theories should not be followed slavishly or ideologically; the Dada movement (and many emancipatory movements) shows the value of challenging accepted modes of thought and how such challenges develop fresh perspectives (even if only indi- rectly through providing an initial critique that may then be built upon) • Official, elite, top-down objective explanations should be tem- pered by normative, grassroots, bottom-up, unofficial, and intersubjective approaches, requiring interdisciplinarity and experimental global, open research networks • Experimental eclecticism as developed here may be used as a wild-card component of any research project • Research requires creativity In this way, it might be said, a vast range of anthropological and ethnographic evidence, as well as literary, scientific, and other evi-</page><page sequence="23">Oliver P. Richmond 467 dence, has opened up to the analysis of international relations, illus- trating that peace, conflict avoidance, and accommodation are the stronger impulses of human culture.86 Uncovering and exploring the implications of this is well served by an approach of experimen- tal eclecticism.87 Far more can still be done by drawing upon a range of eclectic sources across disciplines and contexts in order to intro- duce diversity into international relations that reflects its subject matter and its reconfigured objectives of negotiating consensual forms of peace. This is particularly important because of the way international relations is used around the world. In universities and institutions in developing countries (often in postconflict environments) the exchange of knowledge is heavily weighted toward the export of knowledge from the developed world. In many research environ- ments, work is conducted on local problems using orthodox theo- retical frameworks, concepts, methods, and ontology exported wholesale from the developed world. There is little opportunity to locally or globally renegotiate what become biased and paternalistic epistemes. As this article has attempted to illustrate, experimental eclecti- cism in method, knowledge, and theory production might facilitate the exchange of a wider understanding within and beyond the disci- pline from diverse and globally representative ontologies and episte- mologies. It might help avoid the tendency toward universalism with- out concerted consideration of social particularities. Given the possibilities already identified above, clearly this advantage might be amplified many times over by a discipline that might then aid in the facilitation of a more comprehensive global exchange of knowledge, rather than merely the epistemic hegemony of the developed wor[l]d. Experimental eclecticism may help to overcome these limi- tations by introducing a wild-card expectation of additional and alter- native methodologies and epistemes and creating bridges into other disciplinary areas. This may problematize the hegemonic selection of orthodoxies, resist unreflective insti tu tionalization, and open up con- nections between disciplines, methods, and alternative cultural tradi- tions and epistemologies, just as Dadaism attempted to do. Clearly, the study of international relations cannot fully follow Dada, which had "no programme, it was against all programmes."88 It can, however, avoid unnecessary constraints that prejudge, mar- ginalize, bias, and prioritize, reproducing approaches to the disci- pline that do not reflect the legitimacy and consensus derived from people and everyday lives, which any organization or institution should democratically and pluralistically reflect and guarantee. Many sources, methods, and approaches can be deployed to develop</page><page sequence="24">468 Dadaism and the Peace Différend an understanding of peace in international relations, but, if the peace différend is to be avoided and international relations is to make its long-awaited contribution of a peace dividend, they require mov- ing beyond redundant thinking, methods, institutions, and the even- tual institutionalization even of the revolutionary moment/move- ment itself.
