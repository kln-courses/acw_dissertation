<plain_text><page sequence="1">321 Theology and Physical Paternity. SIR,--Without wishing to controvert the main thesis advanced by Dr. W. J. Perry in MAN, 1932, 218, on the alleged ignorance of the Trobrianders and others of the physiology of paternity, I would like to invite caution with regard to inferences about ancient Egypt which might be deduced from the birth-scenes sculptured on the walls of Queen Hatshepsut's temple at Deir el Bahri. These scenes are framed round two distinct elements, the fatherhood of the god Amun-re, the patron-deity of the district in his solar aspect, and the fashioning of the child by the god Khnum. In the matter of Amun-re, the Pharaonic title "Son of the Sun" does not necessarily warrant the inference of the god's direct fatherhood in each case, but rather asserts the king's ultimate descent from the Sun, which must, under the matrilineal convention ruling in Egypt, be clearly established on the mother's side. Further, the king, to possess the complete divine powers flowing from legitimacy, must marry a princess of pure royal blood. The mythical beginnings of the descent of the royal line from the Sun, in the Fifth Dynasty, are recounted in the Westcar papyrus, which was probably edited from a version of the Twelfth Dynasty; the god is reported as having connection with a mortal woman, wife of a priest of the Sun, exactly as in many a tale of classical mythology, but it does not follow that he was supposed to repeat the same action with the mother of every king; the divine seed would remain potent so long as it was transmitted in the blood of royal mothers and wives, and if for any king this condition did not exist, a new myth was fabricated, as will be seen later. Now, Queen Hatshepsut, according to the canons then ruling, was of pure royal descent, but those canons did not permit of the kingdom being entrusted to a woman and so, to legitimize her usurpation, she had recourse, as an exceptional measure, to the old myth of the god's actual intervention and added to it the new and all- important detail of his recognition of her, though a woman, as king. It may be added that the priestly story underlying the popular one of the Westcar papyrus was evidently well known to the fabricators [270 ]</page><page sequence="2">November, 1932.] MAN [No. 321 of Hatshepsut's story, for the scenes of her actual birth comprise several details found in that papyrus. The fatherhood of the god was simply physical, like that of Zeus in his earthly wooings; he assumed the form and garb of the king when entering to the queen, Hatshepsut's mother, and did not reveal to her his true nature till he had achieved his desire. The case was evidently a special one, arising from the machinations of an active and ambitious princess. The myth of divine descent inhering in the solar phase of Egyptian religion is found equally in the Osirian phase that preceded it and, earlier still, in the proto-totemic Falcon-cult of pre-historic times. In that remote age the Falcon, as we may legitimately infer from the beliefs of modern totemistic peoples, was the foundational element and central gathering-point of the clan which, in the dim beginning of history. conquered and unified Egypt. The clan had as ensign a falcon on a perch and its mutual relations with the bird are most significantly indicated by the adoption of this ensign, on the introduction of letters, as the earliest written symbol of godhead. The Falcon-in Egyptian horus (Graecized form)-was, in fact, divine, and the king, himself a Horus-falcon, was held to be thereby endowed with divine powers: his relationship with the Falcon was ftilly recognized in historic times but, with the spread of greater knowledge, had gained straiter definition and become physical sonship, as we may read in the Pyramid Texts, par. 568: " The Falcon "has conceived the king in the night." The original beliefs, starting in a far-off age of really primitive food-gatherers, had, by their long antiquity and social effectiveness, rooted themselves so deeply in the philosophy of the nation that throughout its history the king remained a Horus-falcon despite the supremacy won later by Osiris and, after him, the Sun-a supremacy due to the close connection of the new cults with organized agriculture which was then reshaping the whole life of the country while the Falcon- cult, bound up with the hunters' social system now disappearing, suffered inevitable decline. The king's position in the new religious systems was a tangled one and might have proved too paradoxical even for the primitive imagination to accept, but for the myths of divine birth with which the theologians regularized it. In the earlier case the king had to be placed in the same filial relation to Osiris, the new divine hero, as he had with the antique Falcon, thereby reconciling and fusing, however imperfectly, the two cults. This was effected by the myth of the miraculous impregnation by the dead Osiris of his sister-wife Isis, resulting in the birth of the 'younger Horus, son of Isis ' (Harseis8s), who was equated, for the purposes of the myth, with the older Horus; thus the king, who had always been identified by his descent with the latter, took up the same relation with the newer form and became the son of Osiris: it is very significant that Isis was represented for the occasion in the guise of a falcon. Similarly, when, later, the king and his circle embraced the Solar belief, a myth was found by which to affiliate him to the Sun, as related in the Westcar papyrus. The points to be noted in connection with the debate on the Trobrianders are, first, that the Egyptian belief in the divine descent of kings had its roots in the remotest antiquity; second, that the god's action, as represented in the temple of Deir el Bahri, was of a purely physical character which, had not the chief agent been divine, would be considered basely adulterous; and, third, that this case was a special one, framed to meet the definite political needs of an aspiring princess. With regard to the third point we may note that when Tuthmosis III, a very strong and ambitious young prince, born of a concubine, mounted the throne despite his lack of legitimacy, he originated another kind of myth to make his position good: backed doubtless by the priests, like his one-time spouse Hatshepsut, he caused it to be declared that Amuin-re had recognized him as king at a public function and had greatly glorified his coronation, making of it a celestial ceremony. But this was a story too capable of disproof and so, three generations later, Amenophis III, whose legitimacy was not supported by royal blood in his wife or mother, reverted to the older scheme of the god's actual inter- vention, and caused it lo be pictured in the temple- chambers which he built at Luxor; in this he was followed, after many centuries, by the Greek and Roman kings at Phike, Edfou and Dendera, anxious to establish a legitimate status before their Egyptian subjects. Alexander, however, fully occupied during his fleeting visits to Egypt with the building of his city, followed the quicker meth.od of Tuthmosis lII, obtaining direct recognition of his divirne sonship at the temple of Ammon (the Greco-Libyan form of the god) in the Oasis of Siwa. The second element noted in these temple scenes, concerning Khnum, is quite different, founded on a very old form of belief and not on mere royal needs of the moment. Khnum is generally described by writers as the Creator- or Potter-god; the former epithet is founded on a mass of inscriptions of comparatively late periods in which he had become identified, to a greater or less degree, with the Sun, Amun and other gods classed as universal creators; this development is, on the face of it, a late one, part of the syncretism so notice- able in the later Egyptian periods; we must search beyond it for Khnum's primitive character. In the Pyramid Texts he appears but seldom and plays only an incidental part; in two passages he is mentioned as 'fashioning' the king (kd; pars. 524 and 1769); the hieroglyphs and determinatives employed make it likely that his original function was not to 'create' the child, but in some way to shape its limbs as it lay unborn within the womb. There is an indication of this, also, in the Westcar papyrus in which Khnum's function is limited to endowing the royal child's limbs with strength; in the ' Tale of the Two Brothers,' dating from the Nineteenth Dynasty, he fashions a wife, at the bidding of the gods, for the young hero, Bata. Again, in chap. XXX, B, of the ' Book of the Dead,' which was inscribed on the protective heart-scarab laid on the breast of the mummy, the heart is said to be the dead man's' Khnum' who " makes his limbs to flourish." When, therefore, the potter's craft appeared and shapes were kneaded out of clay, it was natural that Khnum should be connected with it, by way of metaphor, and that, on the invention of the potter's wheel, that in- valuable aid to the craft, it should be allotted to him also; we find accordingly, as early as the Pyramid Texts (par. 524), that his name is followed by the deter- minative of a jar on a potter's wheel-the jar being of a form adapted to that implement. This simple figurative device was developed to an extravagant degree in the scenes on the temple-walls of Deir el Bahri and Luxor in which Khnum is pictured as throwing on his wheel two child-figures, one of the newly conceived king and the other of his ka-a patent absurdity, for figures in clay must, of course, be moulded or modelled and cannot be thrown on the wheel. The scene seems, nevertheless, to have passed unquestioned, with all its naivete, for we find it repeated in other places, with one figure only. It is evident that the notion of Khnum as a fashioner was firmly fixed in the Egyptian mind, for in the late periods when, as so often happens elsewhere, ancient and deeply-planted popular beliefs rise more [ 271 ]</page><page sequence="3">Nos. 321-323] MAN [November, 1932. conspicuously to view with the weakening of the official forms, the very word khn.mrn came to mean 'to shape' or ' build.' The body of the newly-conceived child was imagined to be built up from matter and shaped by Khnum, but of the implanting of the spirit no account has come down to us; it is possible that the question hardly presented itself to the early Egyptians, for they discrimi- nated little between body and soul and it is not till later that a distinction was clearly drawn when, in the Eighteenth Dynasty, courtiers were admitted at death to the heavenly paradise originally reserved for the Sun-descended kings, and tomb-inscriptions consigned the soul to the sky and the body to earth-but even this was a theological compromise between two phases of religion, such as is common in the story of Egyptian beliefs. It may be added that if we examine the popular tales we shall find incidents pointing unmistakably to a time when the Egyptians were ignorant of the physiological facts and accepted strange accounts of methods of female conception, as in the latter part of the 'Tale of the Two Brothers '; certain details of this story have their counterparts among the many myths and tales collected by Hartland and published in his ' Primitive Paternity,' with the express purpose of showing that at one time-in some cases not very remote-all peoples were thus ignorant, a thesis with which, it may be supposed, few of us would now disagree. The analysis attempted above, summary though it be, seems to indicate that Egyptian belipfs about divine fatherhood were of very remote origin, long before the beginning, with food-production, of civilization, and that they pertain to an ancient stock of ideas originating with early thinkers-perhaps palaeanthropic -the first philosophers of a rude hunting world, strug- gling, like Rodin's ' Penseur,' to explain its puzzling phenomena. Such ideas, with the coming of civilization and, above al7 with increased knowledge in physical matters, naturally underwent modifications, but, deep- rooted and strong in their antiquity, survived in their essence, while adapting themselves to new paths of thought. Thus Osirianism, while retaining the essence of the older ideas, gave them a new aspect, fitted to organized agriculture, which was soon to be modified, in its turn, by Heliopolitan theories, still crude and anthropomorphic, but informed by a purer science, gained from long study of the ways of the sun. In dealing with Egyptian thought this stratification must be taken into full account; some of the beliefs and customs that might seem to have originated on the Nile miay well belong to the older stratum of thought which had becomre common to the forefathers of a great part of mankind, and in this stratum it seems we should place the origins of most primitive theories, including that of the Trobrianders, concerning the mysteries of fatherhood.
