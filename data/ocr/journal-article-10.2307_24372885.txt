Mary Anne Garnett University of Arkansas at Little Rock The rivalry between authors and illustrators during the July Monarchy exemplified in the relationship between Balzac and the artist JJ. Grandville forms the basis of Keri Yousif's thoughtful and fascinating examination of the changes in the cultural field of book production in the first half of the nineteenth-century. Taking as her point of departure Bourdieu's articulation of the cultural field as a site of struggle to amass economic and symbolic capital, Yousif explores the aesthetic and financial tensions between writers and illustrators in a period that witnessed the primacy of the word challenged by the popularity of illustration. Her book is beautifully illustrated with two dozen black-and-white reproductions from collections at the Newberry Library and the Lilly Library at Indiana University. Contemporaries who were both competitors and occasionally collaborators, Balzac (1799-1850) and Grandville (1803-1847) provide "a case study for the processes of change within the cultural field" (2) during the July Monarchy. Although not as well known today among the English-speaking public as Balzac, Grandville (pseudonym of Jean-Ignace-Isadore Gerard) enjoyed immense popularity in his time both as a caricaturist and as an illustrator of classic texts such as the Fables of La Fontaine. He was and remains particularly appreciated for his highly original half human/half animal characters and anthropomorphic plants; his satirical, fanciful Un autre monde (1844) foreshadowed the art of the surrealists. In her introduction, "Out of Bounds: Book Illustration in France, 1830-1848," Yousif briefly recounts the factors contributing to what she calls the "arranged marriage" ( 18) ofwriters and illustrators during this period: the rebirth of the satirical press in the early years of the reign of Louis Philippe; technological innovations, SPRING 2015 * ROCKY MOUNTAIN REVIEW * 131</page><page sequence="2">including lithography, that made the mass production of images possible; the rise of the serialized novel or feuilleton; the commercialization of the illustrated novel; and the restrictive press laws of 1835 that introduced prior censorship of images, thereby causing visual artists to shift from political to social satire and book illustration. These factors led to a restructuring of power relationships between writers and illustrators as the latter sought greater autonomy and recognition as artists in their own right. Although Balzac and Grandville directly collaborated only twice, first in Les Français peints par eux-mêmes: encyclopédie morale du XIXe siècle (1840-42) and again in Grandville's Les scènes de la vie privée et publique des animaux (1842), their competition throughout their respective highly prolific careers reflected broader changes within the literary marketplace in which the illustrated book became increasingly an object of commodification. Yousif's first chapter, "The Frames of Competition: Balzac, Grandville, and Caricature," establishes the context in which the two men, early in their careers, sought to establish their credentials as author/visual artist as opposed to journalist/ illustrator but found themselves "framed" by the constraints of the popular press that produced their works and provided them with their financial livelihood. Yousif examines Balzac's 1830 essay, "Les artistes," several of his articles dealing with the literary marketplace (1830-1834) and the short story Gobseck from Les scènes de la vie privée (1830) in which Balzac established himself as a "verbal painter" (38) of the inner workings of society. In a similar fashion Yousif shows how Grandville used wordplay, self-representation, and animal tropes to differentiate himself from his peers and to critique the market system in his breakthrough Les métamorphoses du jour (1829). Throughout her book, Yousif provides insightful interpretations of Grandville's illustrations, extending her analyses to the layout of pages and placement of illustrations in relation to text. An author himself of verbal caricatures for the popular satirical press, Balzac published three reviews of works by Grandville that Yousif discusses: the album Voyage pour l'éternité (1830) and individual prints, "Moeurs aquatiques" and "Carnaval politique: les bacchanales de 1831." In her analysis, Yousif argues that Balzac set out to demonstrate "the word as a superior mode of representation" (62) by guiding the interpretation of Grandville's images or, in the case of "Moeurs aquatiques," by providing multiple possible interpretations (62). A similar effort to undercut the visual artist is detected in Balzac's collaboration with Grandville on the portrait of "Le rentier" for Les Français peints par eux-mêmes; a discussion of which concludes the opening chapter. The title of Yousif's second chapter, "Caging the Writer: Les scènes de la vie privée et publique des animaux ' is inspired by the closing caricature from that work, "Le jardin des plantes" by François Louis Français, that depicts animals 132 * ROCKY MOUNTAIN REVIEW * SPRING 2015</page><page sequence="3">viewing, and Grandville sketching, the caged main contributors to the book: Balzac, Jules Janin, and Pierre-Jules Hetzel. The usual role of the artist as illustrator of the written word was reversed in this work, with writers enlisted by Hetzel, the publisher, to provide verbal interpretations of the artist's drawings. Balzac, in financial straits, was persuaded by Hetzel to contribute narratives to Les animaux, a parody of his own successful Scenes, and did so "with good humor, hamming up his own texts to be exaggerated self-pastiches" (96). In her examination of Balzac's texts and selected illustrations by Grandville, Yousif focuses not only on the author/illustrator rivalry, but also on their power relationship with the publisher who controlled the organization and production of Les animaux, and was the legal owner of Grandville's images. Despite his subordination to the wishes of the publisher, however, Yousif concludes that Grandville in this work rewrote the rules of illustration while gaining peer recognition and financial success. Balzac's efforts to assert the authority of the writer over the visual artist while simultaneously using illustration to better market his work is the theme of the third chapter, "Penning the Illustrator: Caricature and Illustration in La comédie humaine." Yousif begins by examining how Balzac exercised control over the production of the illustrated edition of La comédie humaine published by Fume beginning in 1842. She briefly discusses his selection of artists (Grandville was not among them), his rejection of in-text illustration, and the decision by the publishers to go against the dominant mode of illustration of scenes in favor of head-to-toe portraits of characters, such as that of Vautrin by Daumier, thereby privileging Balzac's verbal scenes over those of the artist. The most original and interesting section of this chapter, however, is devoted to an analysis of Balzac's deprecatory portrayal of the character Bixiou, a caricaturist and illustrator who appeared in eighteen novels from 1837-1847, most notably La rabouilleuse, Les employés, Les splendeurs et misères d'une courtisane and Les comédiens. Yousif contends that the representation of Bixiou as a failed artist, a jester or bouffon permitted Balzac to "maintain the traditional hierarchy of illustration by restricting the illustrator to mere visual mimicry of the writer's words" (137). It should be emphasized, however, that Balzac did not seem to be taking aim directly at Grandville in his portrayal of Bixiou. Yousif, in a footnote, indicates that Balzac asked the illustrator Henry Monnier to provide a portrait of Bixiou based physically on Monnier himself and concludes that Bixiou "may be a composite ol the writer's acquaintances" ( 123 24). Indeed, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the rivalry between Balzac and Grandville did not appear to be based any personal animosity. Yousif acknowledges that the men admired each other, while asserting that, "Admiration, however, did not preclude artistic and commercial competition" (91). The final chapter, "The Artist Unbound: Grandville's Un autre monde," SPRING 2015 * ROCKY MOUNTAIN REVIEW * 133</page><page sequence="4">focuses on the artist's "move from illustrator to artist-author" (146) in a work that proved to be far ahead of its time. Yousif demonstrates how Un autre monde was a further attempt by Granville to assert his autonomy. The author of the text's narrative, Taxile Delord, remained anonymous until the final installment and worked from Grandville's notes for each illustration, thus reversing the traditional subordination of the illustrator to the writer. Yousif examines in detail how the tensions between writers and illustrators were embodied in the opening and closing dialogues between the artist's phallic le crayon (pencil) and the writer's feminized la plume (quill) as well as in Grandville's images, one of which, "le feuilleton," depicted Balzac as a chef. A work of aesthetic experimentation in which Grandville combined caricature and the fantastic, Un autre monde was, however, a commercial and critical failure in its day. In her conclusion, "Cat and Mouse," Yousif analyzes an illustration from Grandville's Cent proverbes (1845) as emblematic of the relationship between the cat/writer and the mouse/illustrator. She then briefly discusses how, during the Second Empire, illustration split into two branches, that of l'édition populaire and that of l'édition de luxe. This bifurcation, she contends, "neutralized the illustrator writer" rivalry that Grandville and Balzac had exemplified (176). Yousif provides perceptive and detailed analyses of Grandville's illustrations and Balzac's texts, although at times some of her interpretations seem strained or even slightly contradictory. For example, in her discussion of Les animaux, Yousif argues that "enclosing the text between two illustrations" renders Balzac "a prisoner of the image" (102). Yet an illustration of a quill and pencil shaking hands in the middle of the page in the prologue to Un autre monde is viewed as fragmenting the text, making "the image, in lieu of text, the focal point" (150). On the whole, however, Yousif provides compelling evidence to support her arguments. Readers interested in nineteenth-century literature, illustration, caricature, and the history of the book will find reading Yousif's book a rewarding experience.</page></plain_text>
