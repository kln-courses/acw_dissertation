The main recom- mendation of the study was for the develop- ment of more effective health education programmes about the causes of malaria, its transmission, treatment, and prevention. It was suggested that such health education could be incorporated into primary and secondary school curricula and that the mass media and community leaders could be more actively involved in these education efforts. A final suggestion was for greater training, logistic support, and supervision of the village health workers. Close to half of the world's population is at risk of contracting falciparum malaria and mass prophylaxis will probably only increase drug pressure on the parasite(s) and lead to the further development of resistant strains. Pending the development of vaccines, more effective preventive measures, and early and definitive chemotherapy are likely to be the most useful strategies for managing this serious public health problem. This well- written volume presents a model analytical approach that deserves to be replicated in a variety of geographical and socio-cultural contexts. LAWRENCE S. GREENE University of Massachusetts, Boston PANTER-BRICK, CATHERINE &amp; MALCOLM T. SMITH (eds). Abandoned children. xvi, 231 pp., tables, bibliogr. Cambridge: Univ. Press, 2000. ?37.50 (cloth), /13.95 (paper) This volume makes important contributions to the current re-emergence, reorientation, and intensification of anthropological interest in children and childhood(s) in its challenge to taken-for-granted assumptions about 'aban- doned' children. The chapters in the volume cast a wide net, including historical European perspectives on foundlings and contemporary issues of homelessness, street children, child prostitution, and child refugees. Following an excellent introduction by Panter-Brick, the first four topical chapters address more traditional views of abandoned children, foundlings in Europe. Sa situates child abandonment in Portugal within the larger anthropological discourse on redistrib- ution of children. Kertzer's consideration of nineteenth-century Italy questions what happened to the approximately half of foundlings who survived, arguing that it was not'universally grim' (p. 54) and that issues of gender, particularly after the age of fifteen, influenced the outcome. Smith assesses the economic burden of foundlings in the Azores. Viazzo, Bortolotto, and Zanotto, using records from Florence's Innocenti, suggest that 'enor- mous variations in the mortality of foundlings over time represented an important variable impinging on parental attitudes to abandon- ment and affecting children's likelihood of being left to a foundling home' (p. 88). The book then takes a turn towards more contemporary issues. Voutira and Brouskou describe the ideological battle during the Greek civil war in which both sides sought to win the hearts and minds of children 'bor- rowed' from their parents as a form of child protection. Charnley argues that formal inter- ventions on behalf of children in the face of civil war in Mozambique must be compre- hended in the light of traditional mechanisms which distribute children separated from their parents in families throughout the community. Unsustainable external intervention strategies erode this capacity. The next several chapters underline the complexities of 'street children'. Veale, Taylor, and Linehan challenge commonly held assumptions about street children, viewing these assumptions from the perspective of cognitive dissonance theory, rational choice theory, and social constructivism, pointing to the latter as affording a more holistic and contextualized view. Hecht challenges inter- national estimates of Brazilian street children as inflated and argues that Brazilian street chil- dren are part of a moral economy of the home that is violated when they fail to make economic contributions to their matrifocal favela households. Baker and Panter-Brick employ Goffrnan's concept of a 'career' and foreground child agency and the embedded- ness of child homelessness in the larger context of structural conditions of poverty for families in Nepal. Questioning concepts of children as 'abandoned' and 'abandoning', they focus on children's active participation in leaving home as embedded in experiences of early work and migration common to poor childhood in Nepal. Montgomery's chapter on prostitution in Thailand is courageous in situating child pros- titution as family adaptation to dire poverty and lack of opportunities. The reader is drawn to the question of how to reconcile seeming acceptance by families and children of prosti- tution as not damaging to children with research linking child sexual abuse to a range of adverse outcomes in the West. This chapter avoids the trap of rewrapped relativity and instead poses the challenge of how to resolve these dilemmas. The two final chapters concern refugee children. Hinton asserts that programmes in Bhutan that ignore the agency of children and rely on aid directed at adults may result in inappropriate intervention. Flores-Borquez points to ambivalent identity among Chilean youth in long-term exile as shaped both by a host culture where they do not entirely 787</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS belong and by the traumatic background of their refugee parents, who retain a strong tie to their cultural roots. The book also makes methodological con- tributions, not stopping at simple statements that the perspective of the child must be included, but addressing complexities, such as the problems of interviewing children un- accustomed to the interview situation. Baker and Panter-Brick, for example, alert us to potential research pitfalls, in that homeless children may be better interview subjects because of their familiarity with talking to NGO personnel. While impressed with the high quality of the chapters and the relative evenness of quality for an edited volume, a concluding chapter would have provided an opportunity for tying together the threads of the volume, notwithstanding Panter-Brick's excellent introduction and orientation. Also, one wishes that the title had been broader, or a subtitle included, so that potential readers would rec- ognize its central contribution to childhood studies. I recommend a full and careful reading of this volume to all those interested in research and intervention with children in difficult circumstances. JILL E. KORBIN Case Western Reserve University SIMOONS, FREDERICK J. Plants of life, plants of death. xvi, 568 pp., map, illus., bibliogr. Madison: Univ. Wisconsin Press, 1998 In a Midsummer-Night's Dream (Act II scene 1), Oberon speaks: I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine; There sleeps Titania some time of the night, Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight; And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in ... The culture surrounding the world of plants is inexhaustible and has long provided rich material for ethnographic analysis. Yet how many readers of this journal would be able to name on sight more than one of the plants in Oberon's list? The apparent inconsistency between ignorance of botanical culture on the one hand and, on the other, the importance of plants in anthropological studies of human culture finds expression in the central theme of this interesting book. This theme has two characteristics: first, the problem of identifying constants in the uses of specific groups of plants across cultures diverse in time and space; and secondly, the wish to find generally applicable explanations for these uses. This erudite work largely succeeds in tackling the first problem, but its explanatory claims are less persuasive. The book is structured around selected species belonging to six genera: holy basil (Ocimum sanctum); the sacred figs (pipal Ficus religiosa and banyan F indica); the mandrake (Mandragora officinarum and M. autumnalis); garlic and onions (Allium sativum, A. cepa, and other species); the urd bean (Vigna mungo); and the fava bean (Viciafaba). For each genus, the author traces the major geographical and ethnographic properties. He then adopts the viewpoint of a cultural historian seeking to understand how the concerns of magic, ritual activity, religion, and symbolism 'have shaped the way humans have perceived and used plants since antiquity'. The importance of holy basil and the fig trees in South Asian culture is well docu- mented. Any visitor to the subcontinent will have viewed with awe the elegant, timeless, and seemingly ubiquitous pipal and banyan trees testifying to the remarkable spread of Buddhism and Hinduism. There is a fascinat- ing account of the mandrake, of which the anthropomorphic root was widely traded (and faked) and used for its magical, aphrodisiacal, and other properties. In the absence of persuasive evidence, Simoons speculates that the well-established botanical pharmacopoeia of India, and the presence of the aphrodisia- cal Panax ginseng in China, sufficed to prevent the spread of the mandrake from Europe and Middle East to these areas. By contrast, the claim that garlic and onions are ritually impure and improper to consume is traced through all regions of the Old World. Simoons attributes this to both the human biology of disgust at the strong odours evolved by these items, and to the cultural apparatus which in places interprets the bulb to resemble flesh or the human head. Thus, in this case, different explanatory factors might predominate in dis- tinct cases of avoidance. However, four of the ten chapters are con- cerned with the beans Vigna mungo (chap. 6) and Viciafaba (chap. 7-9). Simoons argues that the urd bean (black gram; Sanskrit masa) has been used in South Asia since the second mil- lennium BC; that it may have been domesti- cated by pre-Aryan Dravidian peoples of the subcontinent; and that its dark hue led to its widespread rejection from the Hindu diet on grounds of symbolic associations with low caste, ritual impurity, and animal flesh. The latter argument relies on Mary Douglas's 788</page></plain_text>
