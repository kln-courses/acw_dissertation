<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHAT IS FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY? Patricia Kitcher and Kathleen V. Wilkes I-Patricia Kitcher I As believers have sometimes felt it necessary to try to'save Christ from the Christians'-that is, from Christians other than themselves-as a critical admirer of Freud's, I wish to try to save at least some of Freud from the Freudians. The part of Freud's work I propose to rescue is extremely unpopular both with contemporary Freudians and with historians of psychoanalysis. The definition of 'metapsychology' provided by The Language of Psychoanalysis gives ample hints about why the doctrine has so few friends: Metapsychology constructs an ensemble of conceptual models which are more or less far removed from empirical reality. Examples are the fiction of a psychical apparatus divided up into agencies, the theory of instincts, the hypothetical process of repression, and so on.' As if to cement the alienation of practically-minded clinicians and empirically-oriented psychologists, the entry continues by making an explicit analogy between metapsychology and metaphysics. Students of the psychoanalytic movement have also been hostile to metapsychology. Adolf Griinbaum cites Freud's description of metapsychology as a 'speculative superstructure . . . that can be abandoned or changed without loss', in order to deny the suggestion that Freud regarded metapsychology as making any essential contribution to the support of his clinical theories.2 In Griinbaum's history, Freud did not see his clinical doctrines as deriving support from theoretical considerations, but rather as resting on 'the evidence of the couch'.3 By contrast, 'J.

Part I, chapter 2 passim.</page><page sequence="2">102 I-PATRICIA KITCHER Frank Sulloway argues that the biological assumptions embedded in Freud's metapsychological claims exerted a constant pressure on the development of psychoanalysis. The influence was, however, thoroughly baneful. Unwilling to give up any claims to his own originality, Freud denied the biological underpinnings of his theories, thus turning himself into a 'crypto-biologist'.4 He constantly made use of biological theories both for inspiration and for collateral support for psychoanalytic claims; however he disguised this fact from his students, in part by shredding (as we would now put it) all his notes, manuscripts, diaries, and correspondence, twice-once in 1885 and again in 1907.5 Freud's intellectual heirs have continued the denial of biological foundations, now with two motivations. Besides the wish to enhance the creative genius of their hero, they are understandably reluctant to take seriously the idea that much of Freudian theory stands-or falls-with nineteenth century biology. While I concur with the great majority of their reviewers in regarding Sulloway's and Grfinbaum's books as outstanding contributions to our understanding of Freud and Freudianism, I disagree with both their accounts of how to understand metapsychology. I take Freud's concerns with metapsychology to focus primarily on the methodological question of what a com- pleted science of psychology should look like. This is not to deny that he offers substantive metapsychological claims; rather, my thesis is that Freud's enduring commitment to metapsychology does not reflect any attachment to particular doctrines, but rather a vision of how various sciences can combine their results to tell us everything we want to know about human mental life. My interest in Freud's metapsychology does not derive from the purely historical goals of trying to set the record straight or trying to give Freud his due credit or criticism on this issue. Over the last decade, we have seen (in North America, at least) a tremendous change in the psychological Zeitgeist. Psychologists, philosophers of psychology, linguists, computer scientists, neurophysiologists, anthropologists and others have converted to the view that pro- gress in any of the 'cognitive sciences' can only be made by an 4 Frank Sulloway, Freud, Biologist of the Mind (New York: Basic Books, Inc.), 1979; see especially pp. 3-5. This theme recurs throughout the book. 5 ibid. p. 7.</page><page sequence="3">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 103 interdisciplinary approach. Psychological experiments and theories must be informed by an understanding of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology; computer simulations of mental capacities should also take advantage of what is known about the micro and macro organization of the brain; psychology and neuroscience should be aware of what we have learnt about computational processes from computer science, and so forth. Since it is our professional duty to synthesize the broad picture, philosophers have to know everything. As I read him, Freud's real longing was not to be a metaphys- ician, but to be the complete interdisciplinary cognitive scientist, or at least the father of a complete interdisciplinary cognitive science. His scheme of training for analysts is nothing less than a curricu- lum for an interdisciplinary education in cognitive science: It must include elements from the mental sciences, from psychology, the history of civilization and sociology, as well as from anatomy, biology and the study of evolution.6 Freud was not only dedicated to the construction of an interdisciplinary account of the mind, he was also well qualified by his own education to undertake this daunting project. Thus I believe that Freud's admittedly sketchy and problematic attempts at metapsychology offer us an historical case study in interdisciplinary theory construction in psychology. My larger purpose is to investigate Freud's efforts in an attempt to gain a better understanding of how interdisciplinary theory construction should and should not be done. In this paper, I will try to make the historical and philosophical argument that, despite its many detractors, Freud's metapsychology offers a sound prescription for constructing an interdisciplinary theory of the mind. II Freud's most systematic account of metapsychology occurs in his 1915 paper, 'The Unconscious': 6James Strachey, editor, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud (London: The Hogarth Press), 1963, 24 vols., Vol. XX, p. 252. Future references to this work will be listed in the text by S.E. and the volume and page numbers in parentheses.</page><page sequence="4">104 I-PATRICIA KITCHER It will not be unreasonable to give a special name to this whole way of regarding our subject-matter, for it is the consummation of psycho-analytic research. I propose that when we have succeeded in describing a psychical process in its dynamic, topographical and economic aspects, we should speak of it as a metapsychological presentation. We must say at once that in the present state of our knowledge there are only a few points at which we shall succeed in this (S.E. XIV 181, emphasis original). Given that metapsychological presentations are to be the consummations of psychoanalytic research, it is obvious that those who would save psychoanalysis from metapsychology have a very different vision of the enterprise from that of its founder. However, it seems equally obvious that Freud does not think that he has offered much in the way of substantive metapsycho- logical claims. Metapsychology attracts Freud as a research ideal; he is quite skeptical, indeed often contemptuous of his particular efforts in substantive metapsychology. He sometimes characterizes his metapsychological constructs as 'fictions' and 'speculations'. Further, he denies that they are essential to psychoanalysis: Such ideas as these are part of a speculative superstructure of psycho-analysis, any portion of which can be abandoned or changed without loss or regret the moment its inadequacy has been proved. But there is still plenty to be described that lies closer to actual experience (S.E. 1925, XX:32-33, see also XX:266). Such passages provide Grfinbaum with apparently unequivocal evidence to support his contention that Freud himself did not regard metapsychology as crucial to psychoanalysis. However, there are also texts that run exactly counter to Griinbaum's interpretation, for example, the passage from 'The Unconscious' cited above and the following: In the theory of psycho-analysis we have no hesitation in assuming that the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle. . . that is ... that the course of those events is invariably set in</page><page sequence="5">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 105 motion by an unpleasurable tension ... [Thus] we are introducing an 'economic' factor in addition to the 'topographical' and 'dynamic' ones ... (S.E. 1920, XVIII:7). One could hypothesize that Freud simply changed his mind-back and forth-over time about the status of metapsy- chology. However, I think that the far more reasonable view is that Freud regarded his substantive metapsychological claims as 'working hypotheses', to be abandoned should they cease to be valid or useful. The position he clung to throughout his long career was that psychoanalysis needs metapsychology as a guiding research ideal: Freud gave his inchoate psychoanalytic theory an economic, dynamic and topographic foundation in the Project (1895) (S.E. 283-387); this view was repeated with some alterations in the VIIth chapter of the Interpretation of Dreams (1901) (S.E. V:509ff.); Freud published five papers on metapsychology (1915- 17) (S.E. XIV); he offered a substantially revised metapsychology in The Ego and the Id (1923) (S.E. XIX: 13ff.); in an article for the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Freud presented his 'depth-psychology' in terms of dynamic, economic, and topographical studies (1926) (S.E. XX:264-269); in the final major piece in the Standard Edition, 'An Outline of Psychoanalysis', Freud again approached his material from the dynamic, economic, and topographical points of view (1938) (S.E. XXIII:144ff.).7 What is this research ideal to which Freud remained faithful for so many years, despite his recognition that his results were almost certain to be ephemeral at best? The most obvious way to begin to answer this question is to replace it with more specific 7 One passage that appears to run counter to my view that Freud always retained his belief in the importance of metapsychology as an approach occurs in the Autobiographical Study: 'Later on I made an attempt to produce a "Metapsychology". By this I meant a method of approach according to which every mental process is considered in relation to three co-ordinates, which I described as dynamic, topographical, and economic respectively; and this seemed to me to represent the furthest goal that psychology could attain. The attempt remained no more than a torso; after writing two or three papers ... I broke off, wisely perhaps, since the time for theoretical predications of this kind had not yet come' (S.E. XX:59). On my view, what Freud claims he gave up for a while was the attempt to formulate substantive metapsychological hypotheses, not the view that all theory construction in psychoanalysis should be done with a view towards eventually achieving a completed metapsychology.</page><page sequence="6">106 I-PATRICIA KITCHER questions about the dynamic, economic, and topological parts of psychological theorizing. III All of Freud's psychological theorizing will be clearer if we note that he restricted the realm of psychoanalytic explanation. Not all facets of behaviour can be understood by psychoanalytic means; indeed not all facets of neurotic behaviour are susceptible to psychoanalytic explanation or remediation. From early in his career, Freud recognized a distinction between the psycho- neuroses, which he believed he could alleviate, and the 'actual neuroses', such as anxiety neurosis. While anxiety neurosis has a sexual origin, it does not derive from sexual ideas: '. . . it has no psychical mechanism. Its specific cause is the accumulation of sexual tensions, produced by abstinence or by unconsummated sexual excitation' (S.E. 111:81). Thus, even in a case of sexually- induced neurotic behaviour, there may be no place for a psychoanalytic explanation. Freud seems to suggest, by contrast, that psychoanalytic explanation is in order at least when the specific cause of behaviour is an idea. This characterization is still too broad, however. If friends set out for Covent Garden because they knowingly enjoy opera, then psychoanalysis has nothing to say about their actions. The actors themselves are witness both to their behaviour and to its cause (S.E. XXIII: 144). Psychoanalytic explanation is called for only when the determinants of an action are both psychic and unobserved. In terminology that is now more familiar, the distinctive and, indeed, definitive range of psychoanalysis is behaviour produced through unconscious motivation. I take Freud to intend the dynamic part of psychoanalysis to encompass descriptions of the unobserved, psychic, proximate causes of behaviour. These would include both particular ideas and forces that act directly on ideas, such as repression, sublimation, and reaction-formation (the strengthening of an opposing idea). Psychoanalysis, in its dynamic approach, provides qualitative accounts of the immediate determinants of behaviour which replace inadequate medical or common sense explanations (S.E. XVI:374). The dynamic approach is thus the least theoretical and most</page><page sequence="7">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 107 clinically relevant part ofmetapsychology. Dynamical hypotheses supply the engrossing twists and turns of plot in the case histories as the protagonists' true motivations are uncovered. From their side, the individual cases provide examples from which Freud tried to extrapolate general dynamical hypotheses, for instance, the early hypothesis that 'hysterics suffer mainly from remi- niscences [memory ideas that have been repressed]', and the late hypothesis that all mental processes derive '. . . from the interplay of forces ... [which] are all originally in the nature of instincts ... [specifically] ... Eros ... and the instinct of destruction . . .' (S.E. XX:265). As I read it, far from being dispensable to the therapist, the dynamic approach offers the basic psychoanalytic explanation of symptoms. Since this is not the usual way of regarding the relation between Freud's psychoanalytic explanations and his metapsy- chology, I will offer some additional defence of my account, and a possible explanation of the popularity of the standard view. On the standard view, what I have called 'dynamic' hypotheses and explanations would be regarded as 'clinical' material, to be distinguished from the highly theoretical and speculative metapsychology. One problem with the standard view is that it does not really have a separate account of what the dynamic part of metapsychology is supposed to be; the dynamic aspect is simply lumped with the topographic and the economic and the whole package is rejected as misguided mechanism. Even Frank Sulloway's normally sensitive historical treatment makes this error. Sulloway starts by talking about the economic aspect, with its references to quantities of mental energy, and then suggests that the dynamic aspect is supposed to account for how these forces are dammed up in the unconscious. That is, the dynamic part is just some particular claims about the flows of energy within the mind-brain.8 But, as we will see below, such claims really belong to the economic part of psychological explanation. So Sulloway has not offered an adequate account of what Freud meant by a dynamic-as opposed to an economic-part of metapsychology. If it is not assumed at the outset that metapsychology is divorced from the clinical work, then the question of what Freud 8 Sulloway, op. cit., p. 63.</page><page sequence="8">108 I-PATRICIA KITCHER meant by a dynamic part of psychological explanation admits of an obvious answer. When Freud offers his most explicit presentations of the Unconscious' in 'A Note on the Unconscious in Psycho-analysis', 'The Unconscious', 'Beyond the Pleasure Principle' and 'The Ego and the Id', he always characterizes the psychoanalytic conception of the unconscious as 'dynamic', in contrast to the usual 'descriptive' sense of the term. As a description, to say that an idea is 'unconscious' is simply to say that it is not (presently) an item of conscious awareness. By contrast, the dynamic, psychoanalytic sense of 'unconscious' signifies both that an idea is not present to awareness because it is repressed, and that it is nevertheless an active force in the determination of behaviour (S.E. XII:261, XIV:173, XVIII: 19-20, XIX: 13-15). If one makes the natural assumption that explaining behaviour in terms of the dynamic unconsciousjust is adopting the dynamic point of view, then my interpretation follows directly. IV Since my interpretations of the topographic and the economic parts of metapsychology are less contentious, I will offer less textual defence. In writings separated by a quarter of a century, Freud presents the topographic approach through the same metaphor: . . the idea of a psychical locality. I shall entirely disregard the fact that the mental apparatus with which we are here concerned is also known to us in the form of an anatomical preparation, and I shall carefully avoid the temptation to determine psychical locality in any anatomical fashion. I shall remain on psychological ground, and I propose simply to follow the suggestion that we should picture the instrument which carries out our mental functions as resembling a compound microscope . . or something of the kind. On that basis, psychical locality will correspond to a point inside the apparatus at which one of the preliminary states of an image comes into being. ... [Thus we] attempt to make the complications of mental function- 9 Here I capitalize Unconscious in order to indicate that I am referring to Freud's systematic sense of the word.</page><page sequence="9">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 109 ing intelligible by dissecting the function and assigning its different constituents to different component parts of the apparatus ... (S.E. V:536; see also XX:266). Freud's message should be particularly clear to current readers, even without the analogy. What he is doing in proposing topographical divisions of the mind is decomposing the mind into its gross functional units. The hope is to introduce some order into the apparent chaos of mental life by trying to determine whether some of the operations carried out in various processes are sufficiently similar to be usefully assigned to identifiable functional units. A functional unit is a unit rather than a motley array, because there is some important similarity across the operations that it is said to carry out. So, in the crucial case of the Unconscious, for example, Freud argues that it must be regarded as a system, a unit, because the various processes he assigns to it are all carried out according to the same set of principles (timelessness, exemption from mutual contradiction, and so forth) (S.E. XIV:186-189). Not only should Freud's topographical approach be readily comprehensible to the modern reader, it should also be completely congenial. Psychology books and journals are filled with attempts to sort the various operations we appear to carry out into gross functional divisions. For example, in recent years, there have been hypotheses about episodic versus semantic memory systems, various attentional systems, imagery systems, and so forth. Further, proponents of these systems often try to correlate these gross functional units with known regions of the brain, a temptation that Freud acknowledges in the citation and succumbs to in most of his highly theoretical writings. Despite the similarity with present research goals, my interpretation of Freud's topographic approach is not ana- chronistic. In believing that a completed psychoanalytic theory should contain a topographic portion, Freud was explicitly adopting one of the acceptable modes of theory construction of the 1890s. This approach can be seen in the work of John Hughlings Jackson, whom Freud read and admired. Hughlings Jackson argued that the nervous system is composed of different levels that represent different levels of evolutionary development and that are able to perform increasingly complex tasks.</page><page sequence="10">110 I-PATRICIA KITCHER According to his theory of 'nervous dissolution', what happens in mental illness is that higher levels are impaired so that thinking is taken over by lower, older, and more primitive thought processes.10 Hughlings Jackson characterized his method as 'anatomical' and 'physiological', in contrast to a psychological method that 'explains' aphasia, for example, by noting that the patient has lost his memory for words. However, he also contrasted his method with those who look just at nerve fibres and cells. A crucial explanatory level is required between cells and psychology, namely, a level that divides the whole apparatus into units based on evolutionary and functional considerations." These units will map only crudely into cerebral locations." As Frank Sulloway has documented in great detail, Freud followed the prevailing recapitulationist fashion, not only in believing that phylogeny recapitulates ontogeny, but also in believing that the developmental approach was crucial in understanding how the mind was put together." Thus, Freud's approach to theory construction in psychology was remarkably like Hughlings Jackson's. He always sought functional divisions within the mind that could be supported by plausible scenarios about the evolution of such systems. Thus, if we consider what Freud was trying to do, rather than his substantive theories, then his topographic approach appears to be a reasonable strategy in psychological theory construction by the standards of his time and our own. Freud's heirs try to disown this aspect of metapsychology in part because they wish to revise the Freudian divisions of the mind. This, however, is no reason to criticize the topographic approach. Freud himself often revised his views about how best to divide up the mind, most dramatically between 'The Unconscious' and 'The Ego and the Id'. As in the case of the dynamic approach, Freud often had to abandon particular theories about mental topography. Still, he wisely remained loyal to the goal of trying to understand the mind in terms of gross, evolutionary and functional divisions. "oJames Taylor, editor, Selected Writings of John Hughlings Jackson, vol. II (New York: Basic Books, Inc., 1958):3-118 passim.

And, in fact it is Freud's economic theories, with their appeals to 'contact barriers', 'cathexis', 'hyper-cathexis', 'anti-cathexis', 'side-cathexis', 'quotas of affect' and the 'constancy or pleasure principle' that have been the targets of most of the anti-metapsychological rhetoric.'4 However, as with the other two aspects, I will not focus on Freud's substantive economic theories, but on the research strategy embodied in the economic approach. Freud presents his goal clearly in a classic statement in Project: The intention is to furnish a psychology that shall be a natural science: that is, to represent psychical processes as quantitatively determinate states of specifiable material particles, thus making those processes perspicuous and free from contradiction. Two principal ideas are involved: [1] what distinguishes activity from rest is to be regarded as Q, subject to the general laws of motion; (2) the neurones are to be taken as the material particles (S.E. 1:295). Freud's theoretical strategy should, again, be very familiar to present readers. His hope is that by tying his account of psychological processes to specific physical realizations of those processes he can discover any hidden contradictions in his explanatory scheme. Similarly, for the last twenty years, we have been telling ourselves that one of the great advantages of computer simulations of mental processes is that by actually running a programme that simulates a mental operation, we can tell whether our analysis of how the process could happen is both consistent and non-miraculous. Of course, could he bring it off, Freud's demonstration would be even better, because he would be showing that the processes proposed by his theory could run on our actual neural hardware. Freud knew as well as we do that the brain is not merely a '4 See, for example, George S. Klein, 'Freud's Two Theories of Sexuality', in Merton M. Gill and Philip S. Holzman, editors, Psychology Versus Metapsychology, Psychological Issues, vol. IX, no. 4 (New York International Universities Press, Inc.), 1976, pp. 14-70.</page><page sequence="12">112 I-PATRICIA KITCHER model for testing the internal consistency of his theories, but the model, for it is what actually does the thinking. Thus Freud always believed that his psychological theories must some day be grounded in the biology of the brain: 'The theoretical structure of psycho-analysis that we have created is in truth a superstructure, which will one day have to be set upon its organic foundation. But we are still ignorant of this' (S.E. XVI:389). Nevertheless, despite his recognition of our massive ignorance of neurophysiology, Freud tried to press his economic accounts as far as possible, by trying to show how the psychological forces he postulated were plausible-without benefit of miracles-given the (currently) known biological forces operating on (currently) known biological substances.'5 Like my interpretation of the topographic approach, this account of Freud's commitment to an economic part of metapsychology may seem too good to be true. However, Freud ought to recognize the constraint of biological plausibility on psychological theorizing if he is a physicalist or materialist. I think that there is no question that Freud was a committed Darwinian, and so believed that human mentality evolved from the capacities of 'lower' organisms; his writings contain many suggestions about how various mental traits might have evolved. Unfortunately, this does not quite settle the issue of physicalism, because some Darwinians, most notably Alfred Russell Wallace, treated the mind as a special case. Richard Wollheim, K. V. Wilkes, and others have maintained that Freud clearly was a physicalist.'" And there is impressive textual evidence on their side. While Freud disparaged the mechanistic medical model, which tried to tie all mental illnesses to particular bits or regions of damaged tissue (S.E. VII:285-86), he always believed that eventually his psychologi- cal theories must be related to brain anatomy and physiology: 'Our psychical topography hasfor the present nothing to do with anatomy .. .;' (S.E. XIV: 175, Freud's emphasis);'. .. we must recollect that all our provisional ideas in psychology will presumably some day be based on an organic substructure' " See, for example, the discussion in 'Mourning and Melancholia' (S.E. XIV:255). "6Richard Wollheim, Freud (London, Fontana), 1971, p. 44; K. V. Wilkes, 'Anthropomorphism and Analogy in Psychology', Philosophical Quarterly 25:126-137, especially 127.</page><page sequence="13">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 113 (S.E. XIV:78). Despite such apparently decisive statements, however, Frank Sulloway maintains that Freud was in fact a dualist.'7 And citations can be offered in support of this view, for example: 'The relation between body and mind ... is a reciprocal one; but in earlier times the other side of this relation, the effect of the mind upon the body, found little favour in the eyes of physicians' (S.E. VII:284). Still I think there is a reasonably straightforward, if philosophically embarrassing, explanation for Freud's apparent inconsistency in this matter. As Sulloway points out, Freud's views on the mind-body problem are borrowed explicitly from Hughlings Jackson.'8 Here is Hughlings Jackson's considered opinion on the matter: I do not concern myself with mental states at all, except in- directly in seeking their anatomical substrata. I do not trouble myself about the mode of connection between mind and matter. It is enough to assume a parallelism. That along with excitations or discharges of nervous arrangements in the cerebrum, mental states occur, I, of course, admit; but how this is I do not inquire; indeed, so far as clinical medicine is concerned, I do not care. If anyone feels warranted in as- suming that physical states in the highest nervous centres and mental states are one and the same thing, he is just as much bound as anyone else to seek the anatomical nature of the nervous arrangements in which the psychico-physical states occur. To give a materialistic explanation of mental states is not to give an anatomical one.'9 In other words, from the point of view of scientific practice, there is no difference between believing that the mental runs parallel to-is a 'dependent concomitant' of-physical processes, and simply identifying them. Whether one is a materialist or a parallelist, one must still find the underlying physical structures that subserve mental functions. The only difference between the positions is philosophical-whether one would prefer to explain the enigma of mind-body interaction or the paradoxical identification of two apparently very different entities. Neither "7 Sulloway, op. cit., pp. 48, 50-51. "'Sulloway, loc. cit., (S.E. XIV:206-208). 9 Hughlings Jackson, Taylor, op. cit., p. 52.</page><page sequence="14">114 I-PATRICIA KITCHER Hughlings Jackson nor Freud had the slightest interest in either philosophical conundrum. Indeed, at one point Freud remarks, with obvious sarcasm, that he has a constitutional incapacity for philosophy (S.E. XX:59). So both Freud and Hughlings Jackson adopt the pragmatic solution of treating the mind as if it were the brain, while still allowing that dualism may be the correct philosophical position. Given the amount of ink that has been spent on these puzzles without seriously advancing our understanding of thought processes, their cynicism strikes me as methodologically sound. VI Because he believed that mental activity must be understood in terms of the workings of the brain, Freud believed that a completed psychology must have an economic aspect and that present knowledge of how the brain works should constrain and guide psychological speculations. Freud believed that psychology must employ a topographic approach, because he believed that mental activity is enormously complex and probably the result of the interplay of systems that evolved at different times for different purposes and so operate on different principles. And, most obviously, Freud believed that psychology must have a dynamic part, because of the revolutionary discovery by psychoanalysis of widespread unconscious motivation. I take Freud's substantive dynamic, topographic, and economic hypotheses to be attempts to put this grand plan for a completed science of psychology into practice. Thus I take the methodological and substantive parts of metapsychology to encompass all of psychoanalysis except various clinical tech- niques. Given this position, my original claim that metapsy- chology is essential to psychoanalysis follows trivially. However, it may well seem that if others have dismissed the metapsychology too quickly, I am overcompensating, by allowing it to extend over the whole domain of psychoanalysis. In defence, I would note that in Freud's correspondence with Fliess, he contemplates using 'metapsychology' to refer to 'my psychology that leads behind consciousness.'20 Further Freud often referred to his z2Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, tr. and ed. The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press), 1985, p. 301.</page><page sequence="15">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 115 unique approach to psychology as 'depth psychology', which is, I believe, simply a non-Latinate version of 'metapsychology', for both expressions convey the idea that his theory goes behind or beyond the realm of the conscious. However, my point is not merely the verbal one that we can use 'metapsychology' to refer to most of Freud's work. As he often noted in his battles about unconscious motivation, verbal arguments are not very fruitful. Rather, my thesis is that if we understand Freud's explicit remarks about metapsychology as laying out the methodological principles he believed had to be followed in constructing a complete account of mental life, then we can see his efforts in a new and, I hope, truer light. While Freud offered bold hypotheses about the dynamic forces of the mind, he had standards about how such claims must be tied down. Eventually, any dynamical account must be extended by an account of the evolutionary and individual development that produced the forces and ideas, and by an account of the neurological structures that underlie them. Further, I have argued that these standards are very much our contemporary standards for theory construction in cognitive science. Thus I hope the interpretation I have provided for metapsychology will enable us both to learn more about the logical structure of Freud's theories and to learn more from Freud about how to construct a complete interdisciplinary science of mind."2 21I am grateful to Patricia Churchland, Adolf Griinbaum, Judith Hughes, Philip Kitcher, Gerasimos Santas, Stephen Stich, Frank Sulloway, and Robert Westman for helpful discussion of these issues, and to Warren Dow for helping me to go through a large body of Freud's texts.</page><page sequence="16">WHAT IS FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY? Patricia Kitcher and Kathleen V. Wilkes II-Kathleen V. Wilkes I agree with Professor Kitcher that Freud had, and needed to have, a 'metapsychology'. I disagree, though, about how best to characterize it. I agree too that Freud had a unique and original vision about the 'complete science' of psychology; but I would locate the uniqueness and originality elsewhere. Since therefore we have these substantial bones of contention, I shall devote most of this paper to them, rather than to endorsing the many arguments with which I am in full sympathy. I Kitcher considers that 'Freud's intellectual heirs' try to deny the role of biology in his (meta)psychology. This would be an extra- ordinary denial. To show this I want to go rather circuitously. Psychological theories (of whatever stripe) tend to take- implicitly or explicitly--physics or one of the 'developed' sciences as their superego. When this is recognised, some applaud it: physics is our paradigmatic mature science, and psychology as an underdeveloped science needs apron-strings. Others deplore it: psychology should not be confined within the methodological or normative standards that govern a science in a wholly different domain. (Both parties to the debate, though, oversimplify the nature of research in the natural sciences, and exaggerate the 'purity' of physics or the other natural or 'hard' sciences; hence it is appropriate to use the term 'superego'.) The influence of the natural sciences dominates psychology via biology. Biology in general and physiology in particular were boom sciences by Freud's time; the likes of Johannes Miiller, and Hermann von Helmholtz--primarily a physicist but scientifically speaking a polymath-had made them respectable. Indeed Wundt, the father of scientific psychology, trained for seventeen years as a physiologist (part of the time under Helmholtz). Biology, and through it the canons of 'hard' science, were taken for granted as the backdrop to nineteenth century psychology.</page><page sequence="17">118 II-KATHLEEN V. WILKES In general of course it is psychologists of a materialist bent who look to physics or the biological sciences for methodological and normative clues and standards. These are the ones who employ biological theories, analogies, models; who would accept Johannes Muiller's battle-cry, 'nemo psychologus nisi physiologus'. But there can be, and are, degrees of reliance on terms, analogies, and norms from different domains. Some borrowings are purely heuristic, assisting the newcomer to come to grips with part of the meaning of a theoretical term. The 'spin' of an electron is something like that; perhaps too Freud's anthropomorphism-conspicuously most marked in his more popularising works-of ego, superego, and id. Such 'heuristic metaphors' carry no theoretical commitments; the convinced dualist, for instance, could use them freely. Other borrowings involve analogies which have a fairly strong positive element, but where the negative or neutral sides to the comparison must be identified; Freud's hydraulic metaphors fit this bill, as would the billiard ball model for the kinetic theory of gases, and (probably) Hume's inner theatre as a picture of the mind. Such models or analogies are usually regulative as well as heuristic, and so start to commit anyone using them to substantial theoretical positions and methodological principles. A third kind of model is intended to be taken more literally. Here the obvious example is the contemporary one: 'the mind is like a computer' becomes 'the mind is a computer'. No longer are the terms of computer science to be metaphorical or analogical descriptions of psychological and neuropsychological functioning; instead, computer science purports to supply the conceptual framework within which psychology should operate. Fodor' illustrates this attitude: The idea was that the conceptual mechanisms exploited in [functional definitions of psychological kinds] were to be identical with those employed in specifying the program states of (a restricted class of) computers. Freud seems to me to have been one of those who welcomed the physical sciences as a superego for psychology in general. (See 'Fodor, J. [1981], 'Introduction', to J. Fodor, Representations (Harvester Press, Brighton); p. 13.</page><page sequence="18">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 119 for example a paragraph from the 'Outline of Psychoanalysis' of 1938, on pp. 196-7 of S.E. xxiii.)' Not surprisingly, he was also indubitably a physicalist. This is clear from the opening sentence of the 'Project for a Scientific Psychology' (hence: 'Project'): '[t]he intention is to furnish a psychology that shall be a natural science: that is, to represent psychical processes as quantitatively determinable states of specifiable material particles' (S.E. i, p. 295). This was written in 1895; and, as all know, he soon after abandoned the ambition of so 'representing' psychical processes. For all that, though, he never gave up the idea that he was working in a science. (He wrote as late as 1938, a year before he died, '[p]sychology, too, is a natural science. What else can it be?' (S.E. xxiii, p. 282).) Nor did he give up the idea that any adequate theory of psychoanalysis would one day be explicable by neuroscience. In 1914, for example, he made this clear: 'all our provisional ideas in psychology will presumably some day be based on an organic substructure' (S.E. xiv, p. 78); and many similar passages (e.g., S.E. xviii, p. 60) could readily be found. What he abandoned was thus simply the feasibility of the project and the 'Project' in his lifetime. We should not overlook the obvious fact that this is scarcely surprising. He studied biology, physiology, neuroanatomy, and anatomy in the University of Vienna, where inter alia he worked on the reproductive system of the eel. He took a medical degree in 1881; he worked on neurological problems in the Vienna General Hospital. With Karl Koller he discovered the local anaesthetic effects of cocaine. Even after his return from his stay in Paris with Charcot (it is sometimes said that he went to Paris as a neurologist and returned as a psychotherapist) he worked for another two years or thereabouts in brain pathology: in 1891 he published a monograph on aphasia, four years before writing the 'Project'. Like Wundt, then, he came to psychology from the biological sciences. I thus find it astonishing that anyone should think that Freud would wish to 'disguise' his use of biological theories either for inspiration, or for collateral support; or that anyone should 2I too shall use 'S.E., vol. number, page number' for almost all citations of Freud's writings--referring to J.

WILKES think that this in any way diminishes his genius. The theory, after all, attempts to track our psychological life back to its simplest and most basic elements, and these, he thought, are the ones that are essentially bound up with biological functions. There are literally countless places in which he insists on the necessity of biology; consider just one randomly chosen comment from 1923: 'psychoanalysis ... is obliged to seek a basis for the theory of the instincts in biology' (S.E. xviii, p. 258). Another work of the 1920s, 'Beyond the Pleasure Principle' (S.E. xviii, pp. 7-64) is throughout heavily, explicitly, and consistently founded in biology. When he abandoned the 'Project', it was precisely because the (neuro)biological theories of the nineteenth century were not up to the task of grounding his psychological hypotheses.3 Indeed, he regards his work as contributing to biology: The phenomena with which we are dealing do not belong to psychology alone; they have an organic and biological side as well, and accordingly in the course of our efforts at building up psycho-analysis we have also made some im- portant biological discoveries and have not been able to avoid framing new biological hypotheses (S.E. xxiii, p. 195). So to a large extent psychoanalysis and biology must evolve together. Thus it is the very reverse of the truth to think that Freud denied the biological underpinnings of his theories, so as to win kudos for originality; quite the contrary-he claimed kudos for originality in biology too. Now to some extent he may have been sidetracked by what he took contemporary biology to suggest. The nineteenth century view of what sorts of thing drives had to be ('drive', incidentally, is a better translation of'Trieb' than is 'instinct') may well help to explain why the sexual drive, that polymorphous superstar of the Freudian stage, received the description that it did. But it needs to be stressed that Freud was sceptical enough about the theory of the drives accepted in his day: '[i]n the obscurity that reigns at present in the theory of the instincts, it would be unwise ' It would be equally true to say that Freud's psychological hypotheses were not 'up to the task' of being grounded by biology. But as we shall soon see, Freud expected the sciences to evolve together.</page><page sequence="20">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 121 to reject any idea that promises to throw light on it' (S.E. xviii, p. 53); as I have suggested already, the biology and the psychology, according to him, need to develop together, each checking and /or illuminating the other. Furthermore, the sexual drive itself, as characterized by Freud, had little if any empirical support in nineteenth century biology; indeed, Freud himself claimed priority over Moll in identifying it (see below). It is no accident that, from Adler and Jung on, critics have consistently challenged or disputed the nature and the role of this drive.4 Moreover, the later death drive (Thanatos) had no support from the content (rather than the theory; or maybe Freud's version of the theory) of the biological sciences of the day. Thus Freudian theory 'relies' on biology to the extent that Freud may have accepted too uncritically the nineteenth century account of the sorts of things that drives were, although this looks a little implausible. The specification of the drives he postulated, though, borrowed little if anything from contempor- ary biology. His theory 'relies' on biology, too, in a much more weighty way: if it has claims to truth, then one day its 'provisional ideas' will be 'based on an organic substructure'; in other words, (neuro)biology would in some far future vindicate or refute them. This is indeed 'reliance', making psychoanalysis a hostage to future progress in the biological sciences.5 The fact that he constantly borrows models, analogies, metaphors, hints, terminology from the biological sciences is not, however, 'reliance'; all sciences borrow freely from other domains for heuristic and suggestive purposes. Freud equally took what he wanted from the applied sciences of hydraulics and 4With reason. Freud's case for extending its scope so widely is pretty feeble; see for instance his appalling argument in S.E. xxiii, p. 154: '[t]he baby's obstinate persistence in sucking gives evidence at an early stage of a need for satisfaction which, though it originates from and is instigated by the taking of nourishment, nevertheless strives to obtain pleasure independently of nourishment and for that reason may and should be termed sexual' (italics mine). 5 Consider a remark in 'Beyond the Pleasure Principle' of 1920: . . it should be made quite clear that the uncertainty of our speculation has been greatly increased by the necessity of borrowing from the science of biology. Biology is truly a land of unlimited possibilities. We may expect it to give us the most surprising information and we cannot guess what answers it will return in a few dozen years to the questions we have put to it. They may be of a kind which will blow away the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses. (S.E. xviii, p. 60)</page><page sequence="21">122 II--KATHLEEN V. WILKES mechanics too; as he did from history, from physics, from medicine, from the 'magic writing pad', from mythology ... in short from all over. If what he borrows from biology is subsequently dropped or rejected by the biologists, then of course the heuristic contribution of the analogy or metaphor may be weakened, or the negative part of the analogy increased at the expense of the positive part; maybe a new model or analogy should be adopted instead. As someone trained in biology in general and neuroscience and medicine in particular, it would be quite amazing if such analogies and models were not scattered freely throughout his writings-giving inspiration and collateral support. There is no question of 'failure of originality' here.6 It is unfortunately true, all the same, that Freud was preoccupied with his own originality. He repeatedly denies that he is interested in issues of priority; and Jones7 claims too that Freud was unconcerned about who held the intellectual patent in certain discoveries. But we cannot believe either. Steele,8 in his recent 'deconstruction' of Freud's 'On the History of the Psycho-Analytic Movement' (S.E. xiv, pp. 7-66), supplies the evidence to show how much the matter preoccupied Freud. For example (most of the following derives from Steele): Merton' cites more than 150 passages in which Freud is concerned about priority-questions. Then: Freud split with Wilhelm Fliess precisely because he denied Fliess's role in the discovery of bisexuality-and conspicuously omitted any reference to Fliess in his 'History'-an 'historical reconstruction' if ever there was one. Again: in 1887 Albert Moll published Untersuschungen uiber die Libido Sexualis,'o which Freud read; but Freud: 'I would not concede priority in the idea to anyone'." Again: in the 'History' 6 So I expect that the reason he destroyed his notes and diaries is more likely to be the reason we all have-too much paper about the place-rather than because he wanted to disguise his use of biology. 7Jones, E.

Yet Breuer had written 'the great majority of severe neuroses in women have their origin in the marriage bed' (S.E. ii, p. 246). And yet again, when trying to downplay Charcot's influence on him, Freud records Charcot's remark, 'Mais, dans des cas pareils c'est toujours la chose ginitale, toujours. . . toujours . . toujours' (S.E. xiv, p. 14), but then suggests, but for no apparent reason, that Charcot would deny having said this. All this is unfortunate, and unfortunate because it is so unnecessary--there is no denying Freud's originality. But to be original does not mean starting everything from scratch; indeed, originality in science is very largely a matter of scratching familiar ideas under a new description, or in a new light, or in a new context, or against a new background. Freud's originality is unquestionable and should be un- questioned. But it displays our (and maybe his, too) misunder- standing of scientific inventiveness to demand that all or most of the planks in the platform of his theory should have sprung unheralded and unprecedented from his head in the manner of Athene and Zeus. (Galileo had numerous predecessors who had proposed the heliocentric hypothesis.) It would have been sadly regressive if, after abandoning the 'Project', Freud had also abandoned the belief that lay behind it: that any theory about the operations of the mind that purports to aim at the truth should one day be underpinned by neuroscience. Fortu- nately, he did not. II We can now turn explicitly to 'metapsychology'. Kitcher's final view of Freud's metapsychology is that it encompasses 'all of psychoanalysis except various clinical techniques'; all the hypotheses that can fall under one or more of the dynamic, topographical, or economic coordinates. Metapsychology be- comes psychoanalysis, or indeed any theory that 'leads behind consciousness'." This, as she notes, is not fully consistent with everything that Freud said about metapsychology-in particular, " This would of course make into 'metapsychology' much of Aristotle's, Helmholtz's, and Herbart's, work. This must show it to be a mistake. These three had 'meta' levels to their psychological theories; but the high level, or theoretical, propositions were indifferent as to whether the lower level statements were or were not conscious.</page><page sequence="23">124 II--KATHLEEN V. WILKES that it could be 'abandoned without loss'-but I see no harm in that: Freud wrote an inordinate amount, and was entitled to change his mind. However, I am worried by the fact that it conflicts with Freud's often-repeated claim that metapsychology is a 'superstructure', because to my mind this is exactly what he thought it was. It might be as well to see what other accounts of 'metapsy- chology' there are. Nobody's description is privileged-and that includes Freud, whose remarks on this score are not consistent. The Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis begins its entry under 'Metapsychology': 'Term invented by Freud to describe what other sciences call 'general theory', i.e., statements at the highest level of abstraction'.'3 Farrell seems to endorse this when he writes that the metapsychological statements (those that go to make up what he calls the 'High Level theory') 'give us an account of the way the mind works as a whole. It postulates certain machinery and functioning, which go to explain the low level generalizations of the theory'.4 Grfinbaum describes as 'metapsychology' '[the] successive models of the structure and function of the psychic apparatus'.i It would seem that these authors accept the 'speculative superstructure' picture of 'metapsychology'. On such an account, 'metapsychological' statements would be high level statements of theory, which purportedly explain why lower level statements work to the extent that they do, and unify and organize them. This is indeed the sort of structure we expect of any genuine theory-an hierarchical network of higher and lower level laws, hypotheses, postulates. Furthermore, this picture of the role of higher level postulates (explaining, organizing, unifying lower level ones) fits well with Freud's own demands on his metapsychology. Consider his remarks on 'internal perceptions' in 'The Ego and the Id' (1923): Internal perceptions yield sensations of processes . . Very little is known about these sensations and feelings .. .

Or, from the same work (a comment which will reinforce what I have said above about his views on biology): '[o]n the basis of theoretical considerations, supported by biology, we put forward the hypothesis of a death instinct' (S.E. xix, p. 40, italics again mine). On numerous occasions we find high level, or 'theoretical', justifications for low level, 'couch-data', hypotheses. To citejust one example, from the thousands possible, see his comment in 'On the Mechanism of Paranoia' (1911): '[i]t is quite possible that a detachment of the libido is the essential and regular mech- anism of every repression. We can have no positive knowledge on that point until the other disorders that are based upon repression have been similarly examined. . .'(S.E. xii, pp. 71-2). My general point is that there is nothing fishy about metapsychology. What the label picks out is common to all developed theories, viz., the highly 'theoretical' level. Possibly the name is what misleads: after all, the theoretical statements of physics are not (or are not simply) 'metaphysics' in the traditional philosophers' sense; there is no such label as 'metachemistry'; the magisterial Encyclopedic Dictionary of Psychology"6 has no entry under 'Metapsychology'. But all sciences have high level and low level propositions in their theories--including psychology. Indeed, we need more than the lower level, and metapsycho- logical, statements when examining Freudian theory. It has recently become widely accepted that the object of study by philosophy of science should not just be 'a theory'-artificially dividing the so-called 'context of discovery' from the 'context of justification'. It must rather be one of a number of semi- equivalent larger explananda: 'paradigms', 'research programmes', 'themas', 'research traditions', 'trees', 'global units'/'GUs' (pronounced 'goos' to suggest the glue-like function of these units).17 Despite substantial differences, what all these have in "6Harr6, R., and Lamb, R., (eds.)

[1970], 'Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes', in I. Lakatos and A. Musgrave (eds.)</page><page sequence="25">126 II-KATHLEEN V. WILKES common is that they demand that the appropriate object of study is a sequence of theories in their synchronic and diachronic context: their growth, development, decay against a background. Such a background includes fundamental theoretical and methodological assumptions; a consensus on the goals and 'good-making features' of the theory; and of course the social setting, research-council funding, etc. of the scientists' research. It would be worthwhile and important to compare and contrast all these variant versions of 'wide' explananda. Moreover, with all of them there is a serious difficulty of individuation- when, for example, to say that we are still within one research tradition, paradigm, or GU, merely developing it in a new direction; and when to say that we have left it for another. But there is neither time nor need here to resolve such issues, interesting as they undoubtedly are. For our purposes the most metaphorically-described 'wide' explanandum (Papineau's) is all we need. Papineau offers the readily-accessible simile of a tree: all branches and twigs depend on the same trunk, most branches are bigger than their subordinate branches; some twigs can be pruned with no detriment to anything significant. 'A' theory, at a given moment, is a description of the trunk, one major branch, and one specific route from major to minor branches and hence to twigs. So a tree can contain within itself at any moment numerous competing theories. The trunk we can think of as the most fundamental shared assumptions and methodological principles. (Example: Wundt's assumption--inherited from many predecessors--that the mental was atomistic just as was Newtonian physics; and deterministic; and that the only methodology for investigating it was introspection. But others who shared these assumptions went off on different branches- the Wiirzburg school, for instance.) 'Metapsychology', qua the set of high level, abstract claims of the theory, will supplypart of this trunk; but so also will assumptions (implicitly or explicitly held) that should more properly be called methodological, Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); Holton, G. [1973], Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought (Cambridge: Harvard University Press); Laudan, L. [1976], Progress and its Problems (Los Angeles: University of California Press); Papineau, D. [1979], Theory and Meaning (Oxford: Clarendon Press); Covell, K. and Brown, J. R.

Such a metaphor allows us to put the ambivalence about Freud's 'meta'psychology into context. Once we accept that 'a' theory and its empirical implications are not the sole objects of study, but that the larger picture is needed, we can agree that what counts as 'meta' and what not is indeed, as Kitcher comments, 'verbal', if 'verbal' is construed as 'a difference of degree' (some 'metapsychological' claims will be part of the trunk, others rather part of major branches); but equally we can insist that differences of degree can be as literally mountainous as is that between the bumps in my lawn and the Himalayas. In Freudian psychoanalysis we have a sapling. But even saplings have trunks, branches, and twigs. The trunk is the set of relatively basic ingredients, the core assumptions (both substantive and normative; both implicitly and explicitly held). Just as Descartes and Boyle assumed that all phenomena are nothing more than the result of matter in motion, so Freud assumed the existence of a dynamic unconscious, psychological determinism, goal-directedness, the libidinal drive, the centrality of a developmental/historical methodology, the presupposition that eventually the theory would be grounded in neuroscience, and so forth. (Evidently the list of such 'trunk', or framework, assumptions can be supplemented or adapted by each Freud scholar ad lib.; I am trying neither to be comprehensive nor authoritative here.) All these were 'given' for anyone working with a Freudian 'tree'. Indeed, why were Adler and Jung drummed out of Freudian favour? Precisely because they wanted to downplay the centrality of infantile sexuality. The core postulates of any theory, and its regulative models and associated methodological norms, can rarely be tested or assessed directly-the twigs and smaller branches bear the brunt of the assault by data. So, as Laplanche and Pontalis suggest, the metapsychological constructs 'are more or less far removed from empirical reality'. (In fact I do not see why Kitcher takes this sensible comment, at least insofar as her quotation from Laplanche and Pontalis goes,' to constitute an attack on metapsychology.) But a build-up of anomalies can "'Laplanche, J., and Pontalis, J-B. [1973], The Language of Psychoanalysis (tr. D. Nicholson-Smith; London: the Hogarth Press); pp. 249-50.</page><page sequence="27">128 II-KATHLEEN V. WILKES persuade the scientist that he is barking up the wrong tree. Alternatively, one or more of the planks in the trunk-to mix metaphors-might be modified or altered. For instance, after the war Freud added Thanatos, the death drive, partly for the reason that the pleasure principle failed to explain the behaviour and the dreams of war-traumatized soldiers; and then (1923) there came too the famous structural revision in 'The Ego and the Id'. It is undeniable that Freud was the only one allowed to reshape the theory's trunk; Jung and Adler, who tried, were cast as opponents, and there is a revealing remark in a letter to Abraham (cited by Steele): '[t]he way in which all of you try to show me the value of the work by supplementing and drawing conclusions from it is of course quite marvellous'9-- Abraham et al. hopped firmly around the smaller branches and the twigs. Empirical evidence supplies a tricky card for the Freudian to play. Here, as Farrell has decisively and entertainingly shown, theory can determine all too strongly what is taken to count as data. The problem is too familiar to need repetition; one quotation from Freud will explain why the difficulty makes friends and foes alike tear their hair: So far as the theory of the sexual aetiology of neurasthenia is concerned, there are no negative cases. In my mind, at least, the conviction has become so certain that where an interrogation has shown a negative result, I have turned this to account too for diagnostic purposes. I have told myself, that is, that such a case cannot be one of neurasthenia (S.E. iii, p. 269). One of the most admirable features of Grfinbaum's book (he also, I note, cites this passage) is that he proves beyond question that Freud was very well aware of the problem here, and tried hard-even if ultimately unsuccessfully--to rebut it. But Freud had of course been trained in 'hard' sciences, and knew much better than most of his followers, then and now, the canons of sound methodological practice. (Whether or not we finally decide that Freudian psychoanalysis is a genuine science, Freud '9 Abraham, H., and Freud, E. (eds.) [1965], A Psychoanalytic Dialogue: the Letters of Sigmund Freud and Karl Abraham, 1907-1926 (New York: Basic Books); p. 142.</page><page sequence="28">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 129 undeniably and certainly knew what was required were it to be one, and struggled to make it so.) However, core postulates or dominating models and analogies are not solely bound to data, but just as importantly are bound to each other; the description of the dynamic unconscious helps determine what mechanisms of defence should be postulated, and what principles (e.g., of repression, regression, condensation, distortion, displacement, reaction-formation, fixation, sublimation, overdetermination) serve to organize the dynamism. The theoretical structure is an awesomely impressive edifice, but must be one of the most extreme cases of underdetermination in the annals of science. Hence we should not be worried by the apparent opposition of Griinbaum and Sulloway. Freud did indeed regard 'the evidence of the couch' as supplying the 'hardest' support for his theories. Equally there was-as there should have been- theoretical pressure from above. Some such pressure derives from the metapsychology, e.g., from the dynamic, topographical, and economic structure and the implications of that, or from the 'two fundamental hypotheses' of the 'Outline' (S.E. xxiii, p. 145: that of the structured psychic apparatus extended in space; and p. 158: that the psychical includes the unconscious). But pressure comes not only from the metapsychology but also from other parts of the background: the demands of consistency, simplicity, explanatory scope, empirical adequacy, coherence, coherence with other theories in the human sciences, biological plausibility, etc., etc.-the core or fundamental principles, and methodological demands, of the theory's trunk. What then of Freud's comment that the 'speculative super- structure ... can be abandoned or changed without loss' (S.E. xx, p. 32), when contrasted with his description of it as 'the consummation of psycho-analytic research' (S.E. xiv, p. 181)? This becomes intelligible if we suppose that Freud realized the underdetermination of the highly abstract theoretical claims by the data from the couch. (This he undoubtedly did realize; see, as one of many examples, S.E. xiv, pp. 78-9.) There is colossal slack between most of the superstructure and the data-base. Notwithstanding this realization, Freud was throughout his life remarkably protective of the superstructure--he and he alone was permitted to modify it-and would not have accepted Wittgenstein's challenge: '[c]ouldn't the whole thing have been</page><page sequence="29">130 II-KATHLEEN V. WILKES differently treated?'20 For the job of the 'superstructure' is to pull together, explain, and unify, the low level hypotheses that were suggested by the clinical evidence; and Freud necessarily, frequently, consistently, so used it. If however we consider 'the' superstructure to be the three co- ordinates of the dynamic, the topographical, and the economic, thus broadly envisioned-rather than various specific key postulates within these co-ordinates, such as infantile sexuality, resistance and repression, the mechanisms of defence, Eros and Thanatos, etc.-then Freud could not possibly have abandoned them. Here his assertion that the metapsychology could be 'abandoned without loss' is about as accurate to his own methodology as was Newton's 'hypotheses non fingo'. Psycho- therapy, and conjectures about the aetiology of psychological disease, make no sense without the supposition that the unconscious is dynamic. Some forms of unconscious dynamism had long been around; Freud-unlike, say, Shakespeare or Wordsworth, who were just as sure as was Freud that the unconscious was dynamic, and that there was in all of us 'widespread unconscious motivation' (Kitcher, p. 114)-set out to describe the nature of the dynamism. Topographical ('functional') descriptions of the mind had long been taken for granted by neurologists; Freud is not here original. What distinguishes him from his colleagues in neurology was that he was-at least post-'Project'--less sanguine about the possibility of finding neuroscientific ('structural') bases for his psychological phenomena than were they for Broca's or Wernicke's aphasia, or for prosopagnosia. The economic hypothesis too is not dispensable. Writing about Freud's use of economic models, Hart rightly claims:21 Such models are essential if we are to discern causal structures in the mind. For the essence of causation includes conservation, and conservation is of the essence of an economic model. Without a causal structure, the mind 0 Wittgenstein, L.

Hopkins (eds.), Philosophical Essays on Freud (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); p. 193.</page><page sequence="30">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 131 should probably be denied to have a nature; and if the mind had no nature, there would be precious little for a scientific psychology to discover. None of these, then, was per se dispensable-any more than was determinism in Newtonian physics; or psychological atomism, and the method of introspection, in Wundtian structuralism. The articulation and description of the dynamic forces, the structure of the topographical map, and the sort of stuff that got economized--these were the modifiable hypotheses; just as the exact type of introspection to be deployed distinguished Wundt at Leipzig from the Wuirzburg school. To conclude this section let me offer an anachronistic suggestion. Why not treat the core postulates of Freudian theory, pro tem. anyway, instrumentalistically- accepting Laplanche and Pontalis's description of 'a psychical apparatus divided up into agencies' as a 'fiction'? Realist construals of psychoanalytic theory may be supported, at least to some extent, in two ways. Either by solid, 'hard' data from the couch and from empirical studies (notwithstanding the fact that Freud neglected the latter, and that all the evidence we have so far fails to give Freudian theory any more support than that enjoyed by Jungian, Kleinian, Adlerian, behavioural (etc.) theories). Or they can be defended by neuroscientific underpinnings--and these are far away. I have suggested elsewhere22 that the immensely successful apparatus of common sense psychology should largely be construed instrumentalistically, and so it should be clear that I have nothing against instrumentalism in psychology. Quite apart from that, though, much of science can be seen to have developed by means of hypotheses that were originally used and deployed without necessary commitment on the part of scientists either to their truth, or to the entities to which the theoretical terms referred. Much of it, also, sub- sequently turned realist, as the theoretical entities were 'found' by newer technology, or were supported by independent data. Given the gross underdetermination of Freudian (and Jungian, Kleinian, Adlerian, behavioural ...) theory, should we not 22 Wilkes, K. V. [1987], 'Describing the Child's Mind', inJ.

WILKES adopt the notion 'ifit works, don't muck it about'-even though the question whether Freudian theory 'works', clinically, is moot-and leave questions of realism and truth to await what Freud believed to be essential: confirmation from neuroscience?23 III Finally, where Freud's originality lies: Kitcher would like to give Freud credit for being, so to speak, the godfather of 'the complete interdisciplinary cognitive scien[ce]'; a forerunner of 'a tremendous change in the psychological Zeitgeist' which has swept over North America at least, a change which has at last got 'psychologists, philosophers of psychology, linguists, computer scientists, neurophysiologists, anthropologists, and others... con- verted to the view that progress in any of the "cognitive sciences" can only be made by an interdisciplinary approach' (p. 102-3). Be- longing to one of the benighted countries outside North America, I shall conclude by putting this claim into some perspective. If psychology gets to be equated with 'cognitive science', we would be restricting ourselves savagely and unnecessarily. The understanding of the unity of the study of living organisms which was taken for granted by philosopher-psychologists between Aristotle and Descartes would, slowly recovered, be again in jeopardy. Descartes hived off the tip of conscious mental processes from the rest of the iceberg of mentality; saddled us with an allegedly homogeneous 'mind'; and set philosophy- psychology off on a track from which Watson was not the first, but was certainly one of the most conspicuous, tojump (perhaps this is his main claim to credit). My fear is that the worship of 'cognitive science' is doing something strictly analogous. Just as most interesting psychological phenomena aren't exclusively conscious, so there is a vast amount that is not (by any reasonable 23 Strangely enough such a (temporary) instrumentalism might not be wholly alien to Freud. In 'Beyond the Pleasure Principle' we find him saying: It may be asked whether and how far I am myself convinced of the truth of the hypotheses that have been set out in these pages. My answer would be that I am not convinced myself... Or, more precisely, that I do not know how far I believe in them ... It is surely possible to throw oneself into a line of thought and to follow it wherever it leads out of simple scientific curiosity, or, if the reader prefers, as an advocatus diaboli.. . it is impossible to pursue an idea of this kind [the regressive character of drives] except by repeatedly combining factual material with what is purely speculative and thus diverging widely from empirical observation (S.E. xviii, pp. 59-60).</page><page sequence="32">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 133 reading of the term 'cognitive') cognitive in psychology. Emotions; all the senses (including kinaesthesia); sensations such as pain; sensori-motor control-a broad field. There is nothing wrong with 'cognitive science' except its imperialist claim to the whole field of psychology. There is nothing wrong with 'the' computer model of the mind except for its claim to be 'the', and not 'a', model for psychology. But philosophical psychology has throughout its history-at least its post-Cartesian history-always been saddled with 'THE' model. Hume's 'inner theatre'-which he at least, unlike most of his associationist followers, knew was no more than a weak analogy-was the dominant model until Ryle and Wittgenstein. Watson's model of the brain as a telephone exchange failed to win allegiance outside North America. Now, the science of psychology is asked to accept the computer as 'the' model. But single models suggest specific methodologies and implicitly restrict the field of study by ignoring what can't be thus tackled. Wundt inherited the theatre model of the mind, with intro- spection as its associated method-and therefore whatever could not be introspected fell outside his 'New Science' into his 'V6lkerpsychologie'. If the computer invites us to equate psychology with 'cognitive science', it will exert an analogously restricting force. Fortunately the working psychologists and neuroscientists have not bothered to scrutinize and respect strictures from philosophical psychology about what psychology 'really' is. Wundt, as noted already, trained for seventeen years as a physiologist--and then took a professorship in a philosophy department in (briefly Zurich and then) Leipzig. Philosophy, physiology, and psychology, have from the very start been bound in holy or, if you prefer, unholy, wedlock; some kicked hard against the pricks,24 others took the union for granted and "2Most of the early German psychologists were, faut de mieux, in philosophy departments. This made some of them (e.g., Kfilpe) uneasy; but Wundt tried to persuade Kilpe that philosophy and psychology were concerned with very much the same business. The philosophers started to protest actively in 1913, when six (including Husserl) drafted a manifesto which 107 signed, to demand that no more experimental psychologists be appointed to philosophy chairs. The divorce that this century has seen between philosophy and psychology was emphatically not suspected in the last. Fortunately psychology and physiology never divorced, nor even temporarily separated.</page><page sequence="33">134 II-KATHLEEN V. WILKES quietly got on with things. From this side of the herring-pond, it looks to me as though twentieth-century philosophers have suddenly woken up to what has been routine business for decades and even centuries-routine business, at least, amongst those in laboratories and white coats. Look briefly at a very few of the figures who have dominated psychology and physiology in the last centuries. We find that many, even most, took for granted the interaction of the psychological and the physiological (think of all the work in psychophysics); considered that perception, emotion, conscious- ness, attention, and thinking itself presupposed movement (either gross physical movement, such as reaching, handling, turning the head, or muscular movements such as of the muscles around the eye); argued for a 'muscle sense' concept (later to get called kinaesthesia by the psychologists and proprioception by the physiologists); studied questions to do with the localization of psychological functioning; emphasized developmental issues; filled out, and relied on, evolutionary theory. The list is a roll- call of 'the great and the good'. George Berkeley (the 'New Theory of Vision'); Etienne de Condillac; Herbert Spencer; Sir Charles Bell; Thomas Brown; Rudolf Lotze; William Hamilton; John Stuart Mill; Alexander Bain; Jacques Loeb; Johannes Miiller; Hermann von Helmholtz; Gustav Fechner; Wilhelm Wundt; Hermann Ebbinghaus; Thbodule Ribot; Georg Miiller; William James and Carl Lange (cf. the James-Lange theory of emotions); Jean Charcot; Hugo Miinsterberg; Edward Titchener; Margaret Washburn; M. V. Lomsomov; Nicolay Lange; Ivan Sechenov; Ivan Pavlov of course; James Baldwin; Jean Piaget; Leon Festinger. Such a list is necessarily arbitrary, and I have not even included the names of the dozens working primarily in comparative psychology during this period. Some, like Pavlov, are rather 'physiologists' than 'psychologists', but this simply reinforces my point: it becomes boring and irrelevant to insist on one rather than another label. The moral is that almost all the great figures in the history ofpsychology would have taken for granted 'the view that progress in any of the "cognitive sciences" can only be made by an interdisciplinary approach' (Kitcher, p. 102-3), even though they would have preferred to substitute 'psychology' for 'cognitive sciences'. So what is new (apart from the fact that there are few recent</page><page sequence="34">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 135 philosophers in the list above)? The computer; and the sudden upsurge of philosophical interest. Not, certainly, talk about 'function', and 'structure'; such terminology, when appropriate, was commonplace long before Freud. I would agree that 'psychology and neuroscience should be aware of what we have learned about computational processes from computer science', subject to the qualification that they should equally be aware that it is so far mostly negative knowledge, about how the mind- brain does not work (maybe PDP research will change all that). But it is the philosophers who have converted. The scientists must regard the change in the 'Zeitgeist'--which is in my judgment a change in the philosophical, rather than the psychological, Zeitgeist-with wry amusement. If it is the professional duty of philosophers to synthesize the broad picture, then we have been sleeping through most of this century. Indeed it is somewhat ironical to cite Freud as a patron or forerunner of 'the complete interdisciplinary cognitive scien[ce]'. For if Adler and Jung were right to dispute the centrality of the sexual drive, 'cognitive science' errs in the other direction: not nearly enough libido. Computer scientists attempt to model certain highly cognitive and program-driven psychological competences, but it is fair to say that models for 'sentience' rather than 'sapience' are not even off the ground.25 If we want a 'complete interdisciplinary' psychology, then we had better break away from computer-worship; and put computer model- ling in its place as just one of the methodological tools in the armoury of psychology. It is only one model, and it allows us to see certain aspects of certain phenomena through it; but different problems have different facets, and numerous models will be required (just as they are in physics). Furthermore, casting Freud as the patron saint of cognitive science mis-places, in my opinion, his real contribution. Freud's 25 'Traditonal' computer modelling has of course weaknesses other than its failure to come to grips with sentience, and some of these failures are significant, given what we have said above about the role of the other behavioural and brain sciences: pattern- recognition, and smooth 3-D movement, are very rudimentary, and computer modelling has so far had nothing to contribute to developmental questions. Perhaps PDP modelling will help with these-it is no accident, though, that PDP systems are heavily biologically constrained.</page><page sequence="35">136 II-KATHLEEN V. WILKES startling innovation, for which even his opponents must give him due credit, was indeed a unification; but a unification of abnormal psychology with psychology more generally. 'Psycho- analysis is a part of the mental science of psychology' (S.E., xxiii, p. 282). He expanded the goal-directedness of psychology to include the realm of the seemingly irrational. This required breaking the hold on psychology of the 'conventional identifi- cation of the mental with the conscious', a hold which rather few had resisted (Helmholtz and Herbart were exceptions). This not only enlarged the domain of psychology, but also sup- plemented and enriched traditional psychology: ... it would be unjustifiable and inexpedient to make a breach in the unity of mental life for the sake of propping up a definition, since it is clear in any case that consciousness can only offer us an incomplete and broken chain of phenomena. And it can scarcely be a matter of chance that it was not until the change had been made in the definition of the psychical that it became possible to construct a comprehensive and coherent theory of mental life (S.E. xxiii, p. 286). Restricting psychology to the study of conscious phenomena: ... disrupts psychical continuities . . . is open to the reproach that for no obvious reason it over-estimates the part played by consciousness, and that it forces us prematurely to abandon the field of psychological research without being able to offer us any compensation from other fields (S.E. xiv, p. 168). To say, with Kitcher, that '[p]sychoanalytic explanation is called for only when the determinant of an action is both psychic and unobserved' (p. 106) is thus somewhat misleading. Almost all behaviour is the product of a complex meld of conscious and non-conscious determinants. This is indeed implicit in the currently fashionable talk of 'the holism of the mental'; our propositional attitude ascriptions can be explained only against a tacit background of other, conscious and non-conscious, attitudes, thoughts, predispositions, moods, and the like. And it is important to bear in mind that the perfectly 'normal' traits and characteristics of the human agent, such as tidiness,</page><page sequence="36">FREUD'S METAPSYCHOLOGY 137 timidity, generosity, absent-mindedness, courageousness, greed, laziness, sociability, whatever, will (according to Freudian theory) need an explanation that reverts (inter alia) to key features of the high level theory: sublimation, fixation, inhibition, repression--consider only his paper 'Character and Anal Erotism' (1908; S.E. ix, pp. 169-75), where the triad of being 'orderly, parsimonious, and obstinate' is explained via the'anal character'. More generally, at several points Freud seems to be saying that the repression of the libido is the universal condition for all learning and rational progress. (Consider for example S.E. xviii, p. 42, where Freud talks of 'the instinctual repression upon which is based all that is most precious in human civilization'.) Maybe so; far more likely, maybe not-it doesn't matter for our present purposes. My point is simply that in numerous places Freud extends his theory to cover thoroughly 'normal' sorts of thing: humour, character-traits, fairy tales, day-dreaming, forgettings-in short, 'the psychopathology of everyday life'. This is the unification which is Freud's most startling and challenging claim; bringing the irrational and the abnormal into a 'comprehensive and coherent theory of mental life'. We may not agree with the way the theory unites normal and abnormal. But even if not-what an idea.</page></plain_text>
