<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCRATES AND THE SUN BY JAMES A. NOTOPOULOS Trinity College, Hartford The use of the sun as the offspring of the Good in the Republic gains significance when it is related to the rdle it played in the life of Socrates. The symbol of the most fundamental aspect of Plato's philosophy may be foreshadowed in the A pology and the Sympo- sium, where the sun forms a significant element in the biographic account of Socrates. In the A pology (26D) Socrates maintains that he, like the rest of the Athenians (coa7rep Kat ot aBBo), worships the sun. In the Republic (508A) Socrates asks Glaucon, "which one can you name of the divinities in heaven as the author and cause of this . . . ?" Glaucon answers, "Why, the one that you too and the other people mean, . . . the sun." (Translation from "Loeb Clas- sical Library.") The religious conception of the sun is thus explicitly posited again by Socrates, and Glaucon's remark (dv7rep Kai ¢v . . . Kat ol aBBo) adds a significant allusion to Socrates' remarks in the A pology. In this passage of the Republsc Plato in almost the same phrase echoes an affirmation to Socrates' statement in the A pology. He takes this occasion, as it were, to reaflirm Socrates' belief in, and worship of, the sun, which is in question in the Apology. A study of the contexts of these parallel questions and answers points to an organic relation. A survey of the evidence may give us some confidence in assuming that when Plato has Socrates con- ceive of the sun as a god in excelsis he may be weanng into the drama of an intellectual symbol a pattern close to the heart of Socrates. A cursory examination of the conceptions of the sun up to the time of Socrates shows that it was viewed from two aspects, the religious and the scientific. Its importance in religion is aptly ex- pressed by Sophocles: 7ras 7rpoaKvvel 6 Srov vTpXovSra KVKXOV iAFov. A.

This clash came out in the trial of Anaxagoras, c. 450 B.C.,5 whose conception of the sun as a red-hot stone shocked the con- servative Athenians brought up to believe and worship the sun as a god. The charge of impiety introduced by Diopeithes6 marks the beginning of the Athenian aversion to perexpoW&amp;yo. Socrates shared in both of these traditions about the sun. From the Phaedo (96c) we get a picture of Socrates' general interest in science in his youth, and from the Clouds (225) we get a specific form which this interest took contemplation of the sun. From the A pology, however, we also have a statement of Socrates con- cerning his worship of the sun, and in the Sytnpossum (220c) written many years after Socrates' death, we have a detail which illustrates in the concrete the statement in the Apology. An ac- count of the part that these aspects of the sun play in the life of Socrates will show that the choice of the sun in its scientific and religious character as a symbol of the Good in the Rep?sblic is partly motivated from Socrates' own life. The conflict between the religious and scientific conception of the sun was focused on Socrates' trial as part of the charge that he believed in Katvd bat,ubvta. The clash between these two concep- tions is brought into sharp relief in the A pology (26D) . In challeng- 2 Homer, Iliad XVI, 188; Pindar, frg. 44 (ed. C. M. Bowra, Bibl. Oxon.

Burnet inter- prets the implications of this passage with respect to the motives both of Socrates and Meletus: Socrates has skilfully entrapped Meletus into blurting out what he really meant all along (i.e. that Socrates holds the same views as Anaxagoras). The doctrines of Anaxagoras were notorious, and Socrates had been the sTaFpos of his successor Archelaus, but it was impossible for him to be accused on that ground. If the prosecution has been based on the psephism of Diopeithes, Socrates could have replied that it was invalidated by the Amnesty, and would have been entitled to put in a 7rcepaPypaf7w, which would have given him the right to speak first and to have further proceedings suspended till that issue was determined.7 Socrates thus raises the issue deliberately to expose the true char- acter of the old bla,SoWt1 by showing that Meletus is really thinking of his connection with Anaxagoras, though he does not dare to bring it into the open. Though Burnet has grasped the legal strategy of the passage, he has missed the other implications. Meletus seizes upon the point that the sun is a stone to show that Socrates accepted the Anaxago- rean scientific conception of the sun which was opposed to the or- dinary traditional religious conception. Meletus, once Socrates has mentioned the sun, uses the line of evidence, which had been effec- tive against Anaxagoras, to strengthen his charge of Kalva bal,uovla.8 7 J.

Meletus does this by a blunt repetition of the same charge, almost in the very words of the charge against Anaxago- ras9: Socrates believes that the sun is stone and that the moon is earth. It was calculated to have a psychological effect on the jurors, who remembered Socrates' being ridiculed by Aristophanes as one studying the sun from his basket on high; who may have known that Socrates at an early age attached himself to Archelaus, the successor of Anaxagoras at Athens, and in his youth was keenly interested in science. He brings in the scientific conception of the sun, which Socrates was once interested in and which ran against the religion of Athens, not as an end in itself but as a point illus- trative of the clash between the two traditions. If he could accom- plish this, he could make good use of the point Socrates himself had brought out. Socrates' answer to all this consists first in ridiculing Meletus for trying to attach to him doctrines which he could find in Anaxago- ras' book if he cared to spend a few drachmae. After disclaiming the authorship of this view, Socrates also denies teaching it to young men, characterizing such a scientific conception of the sun as aro7ra ovta (26E2). This is emphasized by Socrates himself. In referring to the rdle given to him in Aristophanes' Clouds as a ,uerexpoWozos, he disclaims all knowledge of such subjects: sl)V e ov6ev ovre ,uePya ovre plKpOV TEpl eral.l° The scientific conception of the sun is aro7rov in the Apology even as in the Phaedo, where Socrates tells of his encounter with 77 7repl fvvexs lropla and his conclusion: reA&gt;vTcov ovTcos &gt;,uavrC ebota 7rpos ravTr1v Tr1v SKE{lV afvXs elval cos ov8ev %pX,ua.ll He appeals to the judges, some of whom he knew, as witnesses that he had never discussed such things. 9 The psephism of Diopeithes read: et¢atytyEAs0at robs rd 0eta,ui vo,uPovTas, 77 Aotyovs 7rept tcov ,uerapzxv btba¢Kovtas. 10 A pology l9c4.

It was also to answer Meletus' formulation of this prejudice trepa aalHOPla (26B5), 8Alp6PlA here being equivalent to Ta 8ela in the psephism of Diopeithes, i.e., religious observances or practices. Socrates challenges both the jurors who entertain the old prejudice and Meletus by asking a question which is also intended to express his belief in the sun as a god and his worship of it.l2 It is essential to the argument [says Burnet] that Helios and Selene were not regular objects of worship in the public religion at Athens. At this date they were not identified with Apollo and Artemis (C.G.S. iv 136 sqq., ii 457 sqq.), and the scanty traces of Helios-worship at Athens are of late date. In Aristoph- anes, Peace 406 sqq., we are told that Helios and Selene are betraying Hellas to the barbarians, and the reason is given, btli ri ALa ,UelS ,u8r V#lP (the Olym- pian gods) @Io,uer, TobroLaL 68 Ol aapaapot @tov¢lv.... No Athenian could be expected to worship Helios or Selene, but he might think them to be gods, smce Helios was the great god of Rhodes, and Selene was worshiped at Elis and elsewhere.l3 Since it is essential to the argument, it is necessary to investigate thoroughly all the evidence with regard to the part sun worship plays in the life of Socrates. The problem raised by Burnet is not that of proving that the Greeks believed the sun to be a god, or that it was worshiped in Greece, with which all agree, but whether 12 Apology 18c3. The interpretation of the phrase v0,L4z¢etv @sobs is the subject of con- troversy. Burnet, who is followed by Taylor, takes vo,u£retv @eobs as meaning "to worship the gods," "to acknowIedge them by giving them the worship prescribed by vZos; "he distinguisbes it from VOpthLV @fO0S stvaL (A pol. 26c2), which he takes as "believing in thew existence."

The new edition of tbe Liddell and Scott lexicon translates VOp&gt;LV with etvaL as "beHeve in the existence of" and without etvaL as to "believe in one as a god," i.e. "acknowledge," "consider as." (Cf. Herodotus II, 50.) The use of the two phrases in the A pology shows that not only the belief in the existence of the gods is involved but also the worship of them. To believe in the existence of the gods involves acknowledgement through wor- ship, as Laws 887D, E shows. 13 J.

Burnet's statement that the Athenians thought them to be gods without worshiping them in any way creates a distinction where none exists. One might think of them as gods in the Ionian scientific sense'4 without worshiping them, but religion involves worship; it is only in Ionian science, where @ebs might mean a physical element, that elements could be thought of as gods with- out being worshiped. Socrates' remark refers to the sun in its re- ligious aspect as the phrase baFrep ot aXXot shows. Aristophanes, Peace 406-413, which Burnet quotes as evidence that Helios and Selene were not xegular objects of worship in the public religion of Athens, does not support his new. In this passage Aristophanes is contrasting the Olympian gods, who are the representative gods of Hellas, with Helios and Selene, who are the representative gods of the Persians. From Herodotus (I, 131) we learn that the sun was one of the great gods among the Persians. Herodotus likewise gives endence that the sun was not exclusively a Persian divinity. The Magi, when called upon to account for the eclipse of the sun, call Helios 'EX\ivcov Frpo6dicropa (VII, 37, 16). All that can be inferred from the passage of Aristophanes is an expression of national feel- ing rather than that the sun and moon were not worshiped in Athens. When the Herodotus passages are set side by side with that of Aristophanes we can readily infer that in comparison with the Olympian dinnities Helios and Selene are only very minor gods, a fact which is supported by all the evidence. Socrates' wor- ship of even the minor gods in the state religion, it will be shown, is equally the point of his question to Meletus. A survey of the facts about the position of the sun in Greek reli- gion shows, as Farnell states, "that sun-worship had once been prevalent and powerful among the people of the pre-Hellenic cul- ture, but that very few of the communities of the later historic period retained it as a potent factor of the state religion.''15 It is only in Rhodes and other regions which were once the centers of a 14 Ibid., 80. 15 L.

The part he plays in Homer as the giver of life through his light (II. XVIX 188) iS evidence of the once promi- nent position of this powerful force of nature in pre-Hellenic re- ligions. In Homer we find this force of nature undergoing the usual anthropomorphic deification. But, although Helios is a great god in Homer, his position in cult worship is subordinated in later Greek religion. The cause for this, as Jessen and Kern suggest,'6 is to be found in the fact that no personal union was possible be- tween man and Helios due to the nature of his work. Wandering regularly all day in the sky did not give Helios any opportunity to dwell in any earthly cult place or appear in festivals; his habitation is in the mountain tops.l7 He therefore sinks into the background of Greek religion, which was anthropomorphic, and remains promi- nent in the nature worship of the East.l8 Although he sinks into the background in cult worship after Homer, Helios continues to be an important god in the cults of Rhodes, Peloponnesus, and other places.l9 Among these latter is Athens, where he has a minor cult in the state religion. Our problem is not the question of this fact but of the date. With reference to the A pology the question to be solved is whether the sun was worshiped in the state religion of Athens in the fifth century. The question could be solved at once if we could believe the evidence which is found in pseudo- Eratosthenes' Katasterismoi concerning the plot of Aeschylus' Bassarides. The plot of the play centered in the death of Orpheus at the hands of Bassarids because "he did not honor Dionysos but accounted Helios the greatest of the gods, whom he also called Apollo."20 If Apollo was the sun-god at this period, the problem is solved. A critical examination of the information contained in the Katasteristnoi by Linforth and Kern2l has shown conclusively that 16O. Jessen, in Pauly-Wissowa-Kroll, Real-EncycZopadie VIII, S.V.

The evidence for the worship of Helios in Athens is found in scholia and inscriptions.23 Burnet bases his conclusion on the fact that because the evidence is of late date therefore the worship of Helios in Athens is of late date. In matters of religion, however, lateness of the evidence does not necessarily indicate lateness of practice, as the gold plates of Thurii show.24 To begin with, we have one inscription, IG II,2 4962, dated at the beginning of the fourth century B.C., which gives us definite evidence that Helios was part of the cult worship of Athens about the time Socrates died. This in itself is sufficient to disprove Burnet's assumption. A study of the cult of Helios at Athens shows that it was a part of those festivals which were connected with the fertility of the earth.25 In the pro- cession of zKlpaX a festival in honor of Demeter and Kore, held on the twelfth of Skirophorion, the priests of Helios joined in the procession after the priestess of Athena and the priest of Poseidon.26 It has been conjectured that Helios is a relatively late addition to this festival,27 but it is evident that Helios is an integral part of the rite because of his importance to the growth of crops. Helios is furthermore connected with the festival of Thargelia,28 held in May, when the first cereals and fruits are ripe in Greece. At this festival the Athenians sacrificed to Helios and the Hours, who, though minor divinities, have found a place in the harvest festival because they were divinities essential for the growth of corn. It is therefore natural that the Helios cult should be associ- ated with these harvest festivals. That it is not a late addition may be seen in Aeschylus, who describes Helios as a god who is the cause of growth in nature, a conception which is also found in Sophocles, 22 Cf. Farnell, op. cit., IV, 136-139. 23 For a list cf. Jessen, op. cit., 65 f. 24 W. C. K. Guthrie, Orphe?s and Greek ReZigion: London, Methuen (1935),172. 26 lSor an account of the position of Helios in these festivals cf. Ludwig Deubner, Attische Feste: Berlin, H.

The cult of Helios is coextensive with the religious belief. Additional evidence for the oS;cial cult worship of the sun is found in inscriptions, which corroborate the literary evidence. Be- sides IG II,2 4962, which attests cult sacrifices to Helios at the be- ginning of the fourth century, we have epigraphic evidence for an altar to Helios in the third century s.c.30 No doubt this altar was similar to that of Boreas which Socrates mentions in Phaedrus 229c. If in the fifth century an altar existed to Boreas, who is only a minor force of nature in comparison with the sun, it is very likely that an altar to Helios in the third century B.C. does not argue for lateness of the cult. The inscription lepetas 'H\ov,3l engraved on a seat in the theatre of Dionysus, may reflect a traditional honorary seat for the priestess of Helios, even though the inscription dates from the Roman period. The most convincing proof, however, that the cult of Helios is not late is to be found in Plato's Laws. In discussing how examiners (e§0vvo) shall be chosen, he says: "every year, after the summer solstice, the whole State must assemble at the common precincts of Helios and Apollo" (945E, translation from the "Loeb Classical Library"). When chosen, the examiners shall reside in the precincts of Helios and Apollo (946D), and among other honors they shall be priests of Apollo and Helios and have front seats at every festi- val (947A), a fact which gives strong support to the traditional honorary seat for the priests of Helios at the theatre of Dionysus. Though these statements are made in setting forth the ideal regu- lation of the reconstructed city of Magnesia in Crete, it is evident that Plato is not inventing here but, as in the other cases, is taking preexisting customs32and setting forth an ideal regulationor use. The basis for such statements existed in Athens at the time Plato was 29 Agam. 633; Oed. Tyr. 1425; RepubZic 509 B; Hyperides, EpiGaph 5; Frg. Trag.

It is evident that Plato here is referring to the worship of Helios as part of the Thargelia, which was a festival in honor of Apollo. These passages show that the information about Helios worship contained in late scholia is applicable to the fifth and fourth centuries. In the Laws Plato also gives us our best illustration and bio- graphic commentary on the statement of Socrates in the A pology. The statements of Plato in the Laws give us the ideal portrait of his master with respect to sun worship. The discussion of sun worship as a part of the general thesis of the Athenian stranger that "no one who believes, as the laws prescribe, in the existence of the gods has ever done an impious deed voluntarily, or uttered a law- less word" (885B) is full of allusions to the A pology. In discussing education in the reconstructed city Plato has the Athenian stranger make statements about the astral bodies which reveal how the sun can be viewed as an object of science and at the same time as an object of religious worship. The Athenian stranger in discussing astronomy says that it is "fair and true and beneficial to the State and altogether well-pleasing to God" (821B), and its study does not make infidels (967A ff.).34 These statements are definitely overtones of the trial of Socrates and throw light on a question which Soc- rates dismisses with only a few remarks in the trial. In the midst of the development of his theme the Athenian stranger makes definite allusions to the trial and Socrates' belief in, and worship of, the astral bodies. He takes occasion to deplore the lack of true knowledge about "those mighty deities, the Sun and Moon," and says "our citizens and our children ought to learn so much con- cerning all these facts about the gods of Heaven (0exv T@V KaTX oupavov) as to enable them not to blaspheme about them but always to speak piously both at sacrifices and when they reverently pray" 33 Aristotle, Athenian Constitution 48, 4. 34 Cf. Laws 896E, ., where the body of the sun is said to reflect in its orderly move- ment the good soul, which is properly spoken of as a god. Thus astronomy is made the basis for theism.</page><page sequence="11">270 TZE ClASSICAL JOURNAL (821CD). These words in the mouth of the Athenian stranger not only help us to reconstruct the position of Helios and Selene in the state religion of Athens but also in the mind of Socrates. The form which this worship takes and the manner in which it is introduced indicates that Plato had Socrates' trial in mind when he wrote the words. The Athenian stranger in discussing impiety alludes to the trial of Socrates in his refutation of materialist philosophers: It is the views of our modern scientists that we must hold responsible as the cause of mischief. For the result of the arguments of such people is this that when you and I try to prove the existence of the gods by pointing to these very objects sun, moon, stars and earth as instances of deity and divinity, people who have been converted by these scient;sts will assert that these things are simply earth and stone (886D). This and the further remark of the Athenian stranger, "are we to make our defense as it were before a court of impious men" (886E), show that the allusions to the A pology are self-evident. If this is the case, it is very significant that Plato follows with a refutation of this atheism, in which he speaks of parents showing the utmost zeal in behalf of themselves and their children in address- ing the gods in prayers and supplications, as though they most certainly existed; and at the rising and setting of the sun they saw the prostrations and devotions (XpOKVXISfIS . . . Kal TSKVVfffIS) of aH the Greeks and barbarians, under all conditions of adversity and prosperity, directed to these luminaries, not as though they were not gods, but as though they were gods beyond the shadow of a doubt. (887DE) These passages in the Laws refer to the desire of the Athenian stranger to re-establish the older faith of the fifth century as ex- emplified in the person of Socrates, who believed in the astral bodies as gods and worshiped them as part of the state religion. They throw unexpected light on the historical Socrates, in whose life the worship of the sun as a god and as the object of scientific study played a significant role. The A pology states the fact of sun worship and in the Laws the point is expanded. Though such state- ments make but a thread in a larger pattern, when isolated they give the true picture of Socrates' interest in the sun as an object of scientific thought and as a god, two facts which were harmonious in his mind. Furthermore, the passages in the Laws form a defense against the remarks of Meletus (26D5), a defense which gives to</page><page sequence="12">SOCRA TES AND TSIE SUN 271 Athens the true facts of the case with respect to Socrates on this point. Thus we have in the Athenian stranger a true portrait of Socrates with respect to a small yet important point raised in Apology 26CD. The picture that Plato has given of Socrates and the sun in the A pology and the Laws is enriched by a reference in the Syfflposiutn. In the Laws the stranger shows that worship of the sun is expressed by 7rpOffKVViElS and TpOKUXlElS at sunrise and sunset. These were no doubt a personal form of worship brought from the East. Sophocles states as a commonplace that everyone worships (XpOSKVVEl)35 the sun. The use of the same word both in Sophocles and Plato shows that it was the prevailing form of worship along with the wineless offerings.36 This form of worship, as we learn from Lucian,37 took the form of kissing one's hand to the sun.38 In the Symposiutn (220D) we have an illustration of this form of cult practice toward the sun. In a biographical episode Socrates is shown emerging from a twenty-four-hour meditation at Potidaea- "he stood till dawn came and the sun rose; then walked away, after offering a prayer to the Sun" (7rpoeviayevos TQ r1Alco). This act of worship no doubt took the form of both a formal TpOffKVVlS or TpOKVXlfflS and a prayer which ended a deep experience. In the Apology sun worship is introduced; in the Laws it is explained, idealized, and projected as a basic element of the religion of the reconstructed city; in the Sytnposiuxn we have a concrete illustra- tion of it; and in the Republic we have an expansion of the sun as a symbol of the keystone conception of Plato's philosophy. The sun as an object of science, religion, and thought forms a connecting pattern in the life and thought of the master and pupil. A study of the scholia and inscriptions concerning the sun brings out an interesting point with reference to the defense of Socrates. It reveals that in comparison with the Olympian divinities the cults of Helios and Selene are quite unimportant if not negligible. Their very insignificance, however, is significant for the trial of 35 Sophocles, frg. 672, F.T.G.2 (Nauck). 36 Polemo, frg. 42 in Schol. Oed. Col. 100; cf. schol.

Besides wishing, as Burnet points out, "to expose the true character of the old at:oxi by showing that Meletus is really thinking of his association with the school of Anaxagoras," Soc- rates may have wished to show by the very insignificance of the cults his thoroughgoing adherence to the religion of the state. In the Apology of Xenophon39 Socrates is shown as saying that he worships (VOpl¢il) the gods of the city and that everyone could have seen him at the public festivals, among which, no doubt, was that of the Thargelia. But even the inclusion of Selene, which was worshiped even less than Helios,40 shows Socrates' conformity to the minor cults. This aspect of Socrates' piety even in the case of lesser divinities is illustrated by other details in Plato. Socrates shows his thoroughgoing piety in his request before his death that a cock be offered to Asclepius, in his prayer to Pan, and in his ac- ceptance of the customary beliefs in the tales about Boreas.41 His worship of minor divinities emphasizes in the Apology his pious acceptance of the state religion of Athens. Far from being only a mere legal strategy, the question of Socrates brings out a sig- niiRcant fact which was intended to speak for itself in an audi- ence that regarded the cult of Helios and Selene as very minor. In striking contrast to its minor position in religion the sun is one of the greatest of gods in the imagination, thought, and art of Greece. A study of the epithets42 of the gods reveals the striking contrast between Helios as a cult god and Helios as a god in the thought of the poets. It is the poets who saw the similarities be- tween the sun's rays and Apollo's arrows and started the process of identification of Helios and Apollo.43 In Euripides (frg. 781 Nauck2) we have a glimpse of the fusion in the middle of the fifth century, an identification which is not refiected in Greek religion until the syncretistic period. The poets develop the sun not only as a god but as a symbol as well. The sun and its light become the symbol of purity, immortal- 89 Xenophon, Apology 10 f. 4° Farnell, op. cst., II, 457 S. e Phaedo 118A; Phaedrus 279 B, 229 B. 42 K. F. H.

Pindar is the poet par excellence of the sun and its light.44 Parmenides and Empedocles develop further its symbolic significance,45 and Sophocles elevates Helios into the greatest of the gods.

This allusion to the aofoL is provocative. Could Socrates be considered as one of the aofoL who conceive of Helios in such a light? It is striking that the evidence presented by the Athenian stranger in the Laws points to the same conclusion. He calls the sun and the moon ,ue&amp;\oL #(OF (821B)S and the sun reflects in its orderly movement the divine soul (897D ff.). In the Republic the sun is a god and the ofEspring of the Good (508). In view of the comparison with frg. 1017 of Sophocles it is hardly possible that the conception of the sun as the greatest divinity is original with Plato himself regardless of the question whether Socrates is the source of the metaphysical views expressed by the symbolism of the sun in the Republic. It is char- acteristic of Socrates to examine the inner realms of objects, and in view of the above considerations it is unlikely that we can exclude Socrates from the list of poets and philosophers who deepened and expanded the sun intc a great god and symbol. In the midst of these probabilities we have one definite suggestion that the con- ceptions of the sun in the A pology and the Republic are integrally related in the person of Socrates. The parallelism of the phrase warrep Kat oL a\\oL (26D) with br7rep KaL ab . . . KaL ol &amp;X\oL (508D) shows that Socrates may have planted the seed of the symbol if not the conception it illustrates. In summing up it may be said that Socrates typifies both the religious and the scientific traditions about the sun. In its religious conception Socrates is both a formal worshiper and a thinker above formalism; he conceives of the sun as a great god, perhaps that which he is made to express in the Republic. In the scientific tradition he studied the sun as an element of scientific cosmogony, a conception which is used for illustrative purposes. It is this use 44 Pindar, Pyth. IX, 20; VIII, 95-97; 01.

In the A pology and the Syrnpo- siurn we have definite biographical facts that are concerned with Socrates' worship of the sun. Plato reflects its formal and religious nature in the Laws; its cosmology in the Titnaeus. It is only in the Republic, however, that the symbol is united in all its phases. There he endows the symbol with a depth that is his own, yet, with a significance that issued from Socrates' own life.</page></plain_text>
