<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. Moral Philosophy: The Critical View of Life. By WARNER FITE. New York, Lincoln MacVeagh, The Dial Press, I925.-PP. ix, 320. Fifteen years ago, in his Individualism, Professor Fite examined self-conscious life in social and political relations. Now he traces the working of self-consciousness throughout human life. The culti- vated man to whom this book is addressed will find it straightforward, subtle, stimulating, and intimate; the student of philosophy should rank it with the most brilliant philosophical writing of our day. It is a proverb in theology that, to understand the real meaning of any article in the creed, one should bear in mind the heresy against which it was directed. So we can best understand the view of the moral life which Professor Fite champions if we note at the outset his pet abomination. This book is written to combat authoritarianism in morals, and against it to champion critical self-expression in life as alone moral. The expression 'moral conduct is deliberate conduct' is for Professor Fite a definition; the motto of his book is the dictum of Socrates, "The unexamined life is not fit for human living." The view which Professor Fite calls authoritarian, orthodox, con- ceives of morality as a question of 'right' and 'wrong.' Now is there some one right way of life which alone meets the standard? If we survey the world in which we live, we find that morally it is not one world but many; "it takes all kinds of men to make a moral world, and the more kinds the better" (p. I7). The moral philosopher, therefore, should not conceive of himself as in any sense a judge laying down the law; he should not praise or blame, but should first of all try to understand. But, we may persist, are not some men better than others, more moral? Our persistence in this matter the author does not altogether scorn, but he regards it as motivated by administrative or utilitarian rather than by moral considerations. "When a man says that we must have a moral standard, all that he means is, I take it, that we must have some method of disposing day by day of the necessary business of life" (p. 52). This thesis is defended in some detail. Thus, for instance, Kant's championship of authority against utility rests, we are told, on a false distinction. The morals of authority may imply the background of a theocratic universe, or else the demand 7I</page><page sequence="2">72 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXVI. for social order: in both cases we have a kind of naive provincialism. We are anxious to make sure that our neighbor will act as we think he should; he is moved by similar sentiments; in the interests of public order we all demand an authority which no one could question, or which at any rate no one would care to defy. This is all very well in the by-no-means unimportant department of public safety, but it is not morality. When we hear the wail over 'the present lack of reverence,' we should listen more carefully. Do we mean that people no longer know their place, "their station and its duties," to use Bradley's phrase? But more important than reverence for this order is the reverence for persons. If, with Kant, I am to treat no man as a means only-not even myself-but always as an end, then I cannot make social order or efficiency an end. The awakening of the working-class in our time, so far from marking the decay of reverence, marks, in our author's view, "a significant extension-perhaps the most significant in the history of the race-of the territory of the moral world" (p. 94). Moral problems, then, are continuing problems, inviting contem- plation; we cannot dispose of the problem of life: at every step in the understanding of it, new problems confront us, new problems of understanding. There is no one single road to perfection. Just as "the artist learns to create by studying the great masters," but "becomes an artist when he ceases to imitate them" (p. 55), so the seeker after moral perfection must become a connoisseur of perfections, a connoisseur of men, and first and last a connoisseur of himself. Morality, furthermore, is not one value among others. Against the tradition of the departmental soul, Professor Fite urges the unity of the human spirit and human life. If we follow the implications of Benedetto Croce's idea that art is expression, we may see good reason for not following 'art for art's sake,' or 'virtue for virtue's sake,' or 'knowledge for knowledge's sake.' The superiority of the artist, Croce tells us, lies in what he sees; the superiority of the moral genius, according to Professor Fite, is equally a matter of insight; and knowledge likewise involves not merely receptivity but the forming of impressions: "every thinking man's impression of the world is an artistic intuition" (p. I70). Beauty, virtue, knowledge, all mark the critically intelligent as against the merely utilitarian or the crudely animal life. When the pragmatist defines the moral attitude as "at every moment an attitude of open-mindedness" (p. I04), our author is prepared to follow; but he finds in pragmatism a neglect of the past</page><page sequence="3">No. i.1 REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 73 for the future or for a forward-looking present, and this seems to him to be another instance of the desire to get things done. " Morality," he declares, "is not a simple question of conservative versus pro- gressive" (p. iii). The true humanist, the man of critical moral intelligence, as Professor Fite views him, does not make any part of life, his past or his present, subservient to another; he lives each moment in the consciousness that, in Walter Pater's words, " Nothing which has ever interested living men and women can wholly lose its vitality." Moral action is responsible action in the literal sense of the term. Have you inquired into your act, can you answer for it to yourself, to others? This is justification by knowledge. The clever rogue, we learn from the chapter on "The Wisdom of the Serpent," is no more intelligent than he is scrupulous; nor is the simple honest man a simpleton. "An honest man is no lifeless pattern of rectitude, but a communicable soul; towards whom you can safely expand, with whom you can be confidential, and whom you can trust precisely because you can communicate with him. And he who is thus com- municable I can hardly rank among the dull" (pp. I29 f.). So morality becomes a matter of investing conduct with intelligence. " Take any action you please. Then put consciousness into the action. You cannot say how the action will be transformed; and no law can prescribe how it ought to be transformed. But this you can say: those who understand will mark the presence of moral quality and for them it will have moral dignity" (p. i85). A moral agent has his cards before him, all of them, alongside his opponent's cards; if despite this effort at mutual understanding a conflict remains un- resolved, then "humanly speaking, the problem is morally insoluble " (p. i96). You may in that case compromise, bargain, fight, but all outside the moral sphere. Such a view of life is critical, but urbane and generous and even genial. Professor Fite seems to lack the respectable zeal for disci- plining others; he doesn't think that something is amiss simply because people seem to be happy. He lives and lets live, not because he is indifferent to others, but just for the opposite reason: because he is so thoroughly interested in the lives of others that he is content to observe without intrusion, and can restrain his prying impertinence. He is an Epicurean of the grave inquiring enjoyment of life-the enjoyment of Turgenev's Sportsman's Sketches, of L'Allegro and Ii Penseroso in one poem (p. 214). It is the gravity of enjoyment, its examined character which seems to give it moral dignity. Having</page><page sequence="4">74 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXVI agreed with Marius the Epicurean in one chapter, our author now proceeds to agree with Bishop Butler in the next. Humanism de- mands a clear conception of human nature. Man is an animal, but "the only animal who knows that he is an animal" (p. 23I). "Man is not merely more 'developed' or more 'efficient' or simply more of anything. He differs from all other species by the fact that he has a culture" (p. 242). He is the self-conscious, the moral animal. But just because of this our critical view of ourselves, the problem of our cosmic status confronts us. How can we reconcile the recognition of the moral as sublime, with the recognition of the sublime firmament of science? This question leads Professor Fite to characterize con- sciousness as essentially 'vision' or rather insight, 'imaginative in- sight.' Primitive thought is anthropomorphic; modern scientific thought is 'mechanimorphic'; "the presuppositions of science have logically the status of human prejudices" (p. 265). There is no harm in this so long as we are aware of the fact: "it is through the con- sciousness of prejudice that we escape the bondage of prejudice" (p. 265). Along with moral worth and with beauty, so truth also lies in the "fulness of critical imagination " (p. 268). And this suggests the significance, and also the limitations, of all systems of truth and of knowledge, scientific or other. To have followed Professor Fite so far means to have realized that he has written a book which cannot be finished. "There can be no logical conclusion: the critical process reduced to a conclusion would be a reductio ad absurdum" (p. 275). The last two chapters contain a suggestive sketch of an ever-vaster horizon. They are entitled " The Presence of the Divine " and " Poetic Illusion and Poetic Truth, " and really belong together. If morality is essentially critical ex- perience of and with persons, if furthermore all thought, all insight, includes this outreaching of creative imagination, then self-conscious- ness, imaginative insight, understanding, and love express, as they also reveal, the Presence of the Divine. Does this mean that "religion is merely poetry, and piety . . . but one form of aestheticism among others?" (p. 301). This question involves a misconception of the nature of poetry. Real poetry is real vision, and to call religious inspiration poetic is to point it out as a revelation of reality: the more self-conscious and critically imaginative, the more significant and real. "For humanism human nature is not even human unless it be also divine" (p. 3i6). The work before us is not merely an ethical treatise; it is a rarer thing: the living record of genuine moral-philosophical experience.</page><page sequence="5">No. I-1 REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 75 A pedant may try to tear it to pieces, but it will outlive the pedant because of the intrinsic worth of the truth which it utters so eloquently: an undeniable and a most important truth, though not the only truth or the whole truth in morals. I have room here for only one critical comment. Grint that no mere conformity to imposed standards and authority has moral worth, that moral activity demands self-expression and critical intelligence: does this warrant us in ignoring the significance of moral standards? The moment I put self-consciousness into any act of mine, the moment I begin to exercise critical intelligence, imaginative insight, I find myself to be more than a mere individual. I deliberate with myself; I am, as my own critic, other than my bare self. In thinking of my purposes of the present moment in terms of my yesterday or of my tomorrow, I am taking an over-individual, a social view and estimate of myself and my proposed act. The social character of personality is inexpugnable. To have a critical, a genuinely individual life, a man must recognize the objectivity of his social relations. And what are real moral standards but the attained and organized insights of individual-social experience? Professor Fite's moral philosophy is in effect a theory of conscience with the whip-and-goad of authority left out. Is not conscience, however, the demand imposed by the critical, deliberate, completer self on the capricious outlaw self of the moment? The inner voice of critical imaginative reflection is the voice of the sane, responsible, socialized personality, of the self that has attained true individuality not despite but because of its participation in the social experience in which individuality germinates and comes to fruition. Why does Professor Fite call moral philosophy a study of persons; why does he seek to understand, and thus to appreciate and in a measure to respect, the motives of those who at first glance arouse his pity or contempt; why does he read novels? Is it not in order to see himself as he sees others, to see others as he sees himself: is he not bound to appeal to the larger experience in which he shares, and by sharing in which he is enabled, through imaginative insight, to be critical and reflective in his own life, and thus to have a moral, that is, a responsible and deliberate life, a truly individual rather than a merely eccentric life? But, in that case, the critical view of life is not without its real standards, nor is the authority of these standards such an abomi- nation as it seems at first sight. If I am moved to act thus and so merely because of the compulsion of authority, of standards, my act lacks moral dignity since in the</page><page sequence="6">76 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXVI. end it is not my act. But this truth does not rule out or alter the other equal truth that the more deliberate and critical I am in my conduct, the more truly and completely I make my act my own, the more adequately will that act reflect the larger experience in which I am a factor and of which I am also an expression, and the more in accord will it be with the living integrity of moral standards: standards which, as a moral being, I cannot be content merely to obey, but which I cannot help recognizing whenever my thought and action gain the moral dignity that comes from reflection and critical insight. There are numerous passages and expressions in the volume before us which lead one to believe that Professor Fite would not gainsay the truth just enunciated. His own work would have gained in balance had this truth been more explicitly recognized. But the truth which he has chosen to advocate has certainly been long in need of emphasis in ethics; and who has championed it as boldly and as effectively as himself? RADOSLAV A. TSANOFF.
