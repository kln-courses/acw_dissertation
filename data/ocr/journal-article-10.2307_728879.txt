<plain_text><page sequence="1">n6 MUSIC AND LETTERS engineering will have no wide general appeal. Nevertheless they ought to exist and ought to be known to exist, and we should be grateful to the authors for their immense labour in compiling them and to the Musical Association for its enterprise in publishing them. Most of us, who take the modern orchestra for granted, need to be reminded that the instruments which compose it have each its own history. We need go no farther back than the ever-popular Brandenburg Concertos to discover that the familiar violin was not always top-dog in the orchestra. The famous makers of violins have their legends (see George Eliot's ' Stradivarius '); but no one is likely to sing of the heroes who elaborated the French horn or who fashioned a massive and cumbrous piece of machinery into the double-bassoon which was to serve Beethoven in the ninth Symphony and elsewhere. Carent quia vate sacro we gratefully accept Mr. Langwill and Captain Morley-Pegge as their faithful historians. The two papers I have called general are, first, ' A Survey of Music in New Zealand: its Weakness and its Opportunities' by Violet Rucroft, and, second, ' Santley and some Famous Singers of his Time,' byJ. Mewburn Levien. The first of'these is rather startling to English readers, few of whom ever suppose that New Zealand, that compendium of natural beauty, is a land without music-or almost. The Maories are a musical race, but little was done to record their music in its early purity, and by now, one gathers, it is partly Americanized. The British settlers had no time or place or opportunity for making music. Here in England, where we have been singing together in one way or another for centuries, every town of any size has its choral society, and every village its church and choir. But where are the villages of New Zealand ? What place is there for the English carol when Christmas falls in the full tide of summer ? What place is there for songs of the lovely renewal of spring in a more deeply hued and evergreen country ? What is really grievous to find is the small place taken by singing in schools. New Zealand, it appears, is prolific in politicians. Has no one discovered that the birthright of all children is the joy of singing and the joy of drawing ? Miss Rucroft has certain recommendations to offer; but surely the first step is to ensure that children should grow up to music. Song, percussion bands and pipes or recorders, used in English villages and English town slums, are possible in any New Zealand school. If the educational authorities are unsympathetic, then the teachers must unite in educating the authorities. But New Zealand mVst provide its own native songs and music. It cannot and must not import from abroad what should spring from its own heart. Further, while not neglecting music as a professional occupation, it must stimulate the songs of the people, from which music naturally grows. One enormous difficulty in New Zealand is the geographical difficulty of getting together. But teachers can form musical associations, in spite of geographical difficulties, and combine to get a good musical foundation laid in the schools. We in England can advise and encourage, but what can we actually do ? Nothing but sympathize, as Michael Finsbury said on a memorable occasion. To pass from Miss Rucroft to the evergreen Mewburn Levien is to pass from a forest of silence to a grove of singing birds. All the songsters of a century seem to gather round the greatest of English singers, Charles Santley, and the centenarian teacher, Manuel Garcia, and Mr. Levien knows them all, and their sisters and their cousins and t. eir aunts. Nothing could be easier than to make such an account merely a tiresome catalogue; but Mr. Levien marshals and arrays his immense concourse of singers, equips each with appropriate history and anecdote, and sets them moving before us with no trace of confusion: So convincing is his showmanship that he makes us feel certain that we heard everyone of them otrselves. Such a masterly essay is not only an invaluable summary of history, it is a stimulus to the practice and appreciation of great singing. G. S. Bird Music: an Introduction to the Study of the Vocal Expressions of British Birds, with appreciations of their Songs. By A. L. Turnbull. pp. 125, pl. 12. (Faber &amp; Faber, London, 1943.) 7s. 6d. The anthropomorphic approach to the study, or at least the description, of animals dies hard. Even to-day it crops up, taking from books such as the ~present one, with its excellent photographs and its evident desire to impart knowledge and enthusiasm, nearly all scientific value. What remain are some useful hints showing that the author is a good field naturalist and a less sound musician (to be which, incidentally, he lays no claim). He is right in suggesting that transliteration of bird songs is difficult, though surely wrong in saying it is futile. It should not be beyond human ingenuity to invent a script for precise notation. Already there are Koch's gramophone records for purposes of checking. And however imprecise the method may be at present, it is truer than to anthropomorphize the poor birds' utterances, speaking of " a tribute of song homage to his Maker" (lark), "its laughter is of a sardonic nature " (black-headed gull) or "mother says a kind word or two in bird-nursery language." And it seems particulbrly hard luck on the nightingale to call its long crescendo call a " Melba note ". One of the author's descriptive paragraphs, that on the wren, is admirable. " The pace . . . is so whirling that the wren seems almost intoxicated with its own speed .... ". That is not only good writing but apt description which helps to identify the song. And then</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS "I7 sentimentality and condescension return in the last sentence with the phrase " tireless little singer ". The. use of " minor key " on p. 21 is misleading. Or does the author mean that birds make use of the minor mode ? In the same way to speak of a bird's song as being " in three movements " is liable to put the reader in the wrong when the meaning is either "in three speeds " or "in three sections ". What is wanted is a study of bird song on the lines of Hodgkins's ' Nature of a Bird's World' where the moorhen's life was described, not as though it were being led by some ineffective, inefficient substitute for mankind, but by a fully aware bird. S. G. ?Contribucidn al eqtudio de la mrlsica espalolayportuguesa. By Santiago Kastner. (Editorial Atica, Lda., Lisbon, 1941.) Curiosities of general literature are common enough ; indeed they have never been so rare as their collectors complacently believe. Curiosities in the form of books on music are, however, not so common, and this book is not merely curious, but rare enough to deserve more attention than it seems to have received in England as yet, though it has been welcomed elsewhere. Its claim to be a curiosity is external ; it is written in Spanish by a British writer and was published, during this war, in Portugal. Its rare quality is that it could only have been written by a musician of truly European mind to whom chance has given an exceptional depth and variety of experience and on whom nature has bestowed an artistic sympathy wide enough to embrace pretty well every shape in which European music has at one time and another reincarnated itself. The author sees our European music as from a bird's-eye viewpoint and with a sense of its ordered diversity which makes the book a genuine contribution and not a sterile freak of speculation. As a specialist in keyboard music, both as performer and editor, Mr. Kastner focusses his attention most acutely on the problems of the evolution of music for keyboard instru- ments, and the experience of his own fingers and research leads him to offer his own shrewd solutions to the open questions of origins, chronology, parallels, influences and the like, particularly in the chapters most likely to interest English readers-those dealing with the impact of Spanish music and musicians on our music in Tudor times, and especially with the history of the " difference ", '' fantasia " and tiento. He reinforces his arguments with an astonishing range of illustrations: from Orthodox, Gregorian and Byzantine ritual, and from the Balkans or the Baltic, he can extract an illuminating phrase with which to clinch the matter of any subject of the past five hundred years he happens to be discussing. But it is to Hispanic art that he brings special understanding and richness of sympathy. He writes on this occasion in Spanish because his own mind is closely identified with the instinctive mental process of the Spanish artist, and if he is at his best in uncovering the origins of the tiento it is because to the practical and technical research required he adds a subtle comprehension of the conflicting influences at work in the Peninsula during the reigns of Charles V and Philip II. A just sense of proportion is evident in his comparison of Spanish and Portuguese music in particular and the national distinctions in general which gave rise to their differing qualities and become more decidedly opposed as history separates them: the Portuguese qualities becoming more pronouncedly decorative, lyrical, florid, diffuse, voluble and hortatory, whilst the Spaniard remains fixed to his centre, dramatic, austere, intense, and tenacious in his. attempt to bind down the fantastic anarchy of his imagination with the severity of spiritual self-discipline and with a preference in music for a concise melodic expression in contrast with the Portuguese meandering virtuosities. Portugal, now as of old, remains vehement of her right, but uncertain of her strength; to maintain her independence she seeks influences abroad to counteract Castile's centralizing power. Gil Vicente used French sixteenth-century songs as Carneiro and his contemporaries employ twentieth-century French modulations to-day. Another interesting section of this book deals with the impact of Spanish music on Italy through the kingdom of Naples and shows how the south of Italy rapidly trans- formed its musical expression under the advanced instrumental evolution of the Spaniards, while the north was still deploying its music in exclusively vocal fashion. It was only a little before the beginning of the eighteenth century that the tide began to turn and that Italy repaid the Spanish Peninsula in kind. Mr. Kastner affirms the supremacy of the Spaniards in the form of variation. The instinct for subjugating originality to a central control is essentially dramatic; in its aspect of abnegation it suggests the nervous tension of spirit with which we are familiar in the Spanish mystics. Indeed, it is the combination of the dramatic and mystical conception of life which may be said to have produced the continuing greatness of Spanish art. In music it produced the compact brilliance of Cabez6n and the grandeur of Morales. In our time it has produced the self-denial of Manuel de Falla. In fact, on finishing a study of this book one sees it to have been written to justify Falla's assessment of his own progress from the picturesque exteriorization of what Montaigne called the " inbred vitality " of popular music towards that sense of liberty from the struggle with the material which such renunciation brings, much as the early Jesuit fathers renounced the use of the organ, and the power it gave them over the souls of men, because they realized</page></plain_text>
