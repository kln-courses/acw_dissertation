<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE TRANSLATION OF THE TERM VARNA No one who has been even slightly acquainted with matters Indian can be unaware of the four-fold division of Indian society into brdhmanas, ksatriyas, vaivyas and jfidras, surely one of the oldest and most persistent ideas of Indian social philosophy. Each of these groups is referred to as a varya, a word which, in its basic and general sense, signifies "colour". The purpose of this paper is to provide a suitable translation for varna in its technical sense, that is, as it is applied to society. We heartily endorse J. H. Hutton's view that varna is "a term which is often confused with caste (jiti, jit) though it is far from having the same meaning". 1) Other scholars have taken the opposite view. For example, A. A. MacDonell has argued that varna is caste in the sense of a group in which membership is hereditary, which is endogamous, to which is ascribed an hereditary occupation and which observes rules restrictive of contact and commensality with other such groups. He feels that Pili literature affords special evidence confirming this thesis, apparently because Buddhism could be more objective about a system which was essentially brahmanic. "Here," he says, "we find the termjdti, literally 'birth', used to express 'caste' like the Sanskrit varna. A man is described as a Brahmin or a Ksatriya byjdti, I) J. H. Hutton, Caste in India (3rd ed.), Oxford, I961, p. 64.</page><page sequence="2">MISCELLANEA 197 or to be by jdti a Chandila or Nisdda, etc., as belonging to the despised part of the population." 1) Prof. MacDonell's first sentence is misleading; _iti is also a Sanskrit word, as reference to his own Practical Sanskrit Dictionary will show 2). Indeed, in Sanskrit literature, a distinction between the two words is scrupulously observed. Against MacDonell's description of the way in which the words are used in Pdli literature three objections may be raised. First, to describe a man as brdhmana byjdti is to say he is such by birth. Varna (like caste, be it admitted) is a status conferred upon the individual by virtue of his birth to parents of the same group;jdti is here simply used in its non-technical sense. Second, while there is some ambiguity in the use of the word jdti, there is none in the case of the word varna. Varna refers exclusively to the four social groups named above 3). It would be absurd to speak, for example, of the Lohar, Dhobi or Lingdyat varnas. Finally, the fact that Buddhism esteemed deeds more highly than birth, acquired status more highly than ascribed status, to employ the anthropologist's categories, made it less sensitive to the distinction between varna and caste than the brdhmana pundits, in whose interests it was, by contrast, to maintain the two institutions. Before settling upon a translation for varna two questions must be dealt with: What is vartna and what is the relation of varna to caste? To the first question a simple answer may be given. The varnzas are large and somewhat theoretical categories of people which are believed to be of divine institution and the sum of which make up the total of civilized, that is to say, Indian, society. We already have indicated their hereditary and functional aspects; it is their sacred character we wish to stress here. The answer to the second question is more difficult. Nowadays many castes claim to belong to a given varna, and it would at first glance appear that the relation- ship between the two terms should be that of genus to species, exactly that ot the class of quadrilaterals to a square. Obviously if each of the units A1, A2 and A3 are endogamous, the A-group as a whole is endogamous. The same goes for hereditary membership and rules restricting commensality. However, the genus-species relation- ship breaks down over the matter of function or occupation, even when one takes into account not the actual occupations indulged in by a given caste but the occu- pation ascribed to it by tradition. For we should expect the functions of the various castes making up a varna to be specializations of the function of the varna; to give a hypothetical illustration, we should expect the ksatriya varna to be composed of artillery, cavalry, and infantry castes. But this is not the case-far from it. It is com- mon knowledge that certain castes of the brahmaha varna pursue farming, others commerce, still others cooking, in defiance of the idstras and in conformity with the venerable usages of their particular caste, and that in Kerala a jtdra caste, the Nairs, were lords of the earth both literally as agriculturalists and figuratively as kings and nobles, up to the time of the British Raj. So we see that the genus-species relation- ship doesn't account for all the facts. And it is only fitting that this should be the case on reflection, for we are dealing with social institutions, not geometry. I) A. A.

However, there are a few facts of a general nature regarding caste and varna in ancient India which are more or less widely recognized and which are pertinent to our theme. The first of these is that varna is anterior to jdti; the four-varna system could and did exist without caste. This might suggest that caste in some way or other evolved out of varna. Manu has stated that the castes are the result of irregular liasons between members of different varnas : what might be called the "mongrel theory" of the origin of caste 1). Now the second fact: In ancient Persia there existed the four piftras, a four-fold, functional and sacred division of society analogous to the varnas, which failed to give rise to caste. Thus the relationship of varna to caste is not a necessary one; whether or not varnza indeed is the ground and origin of caste, it clearly need not have given rise to caste. As to the mongrel theory, it would scarcely be novel to say that it is an unconvincing attempt to make dogma fit the empirical situation. Indeed, emile Senart said this long ago and even MacDonell is forced to admit it 2). Senart went further and said that the whole varna system was an artificial creation of the pundits, having very little bearing on reality. We agree, but would specify that varna is a sacred concept, which explains why it is so long-lived. Castes are born and wither away, fuse together or split into smaller castes, but the same four varnas mentioned in the Rg Veda endure. The relation, then of varna to caste is that of the sacred and enduring to the empirical and ephemeral. It is not surprising that one who holds, as MacDonell does, that the varnas are castes would call them the "four main original castes" 3). But other writers who are more or less sensitive to the distinction between jdti and varna have been known to indulge in similarly misleading periphrasis. Thus Senart provisionally speaks of the "quatre castes primitives", the "trois hautes castes" (dviavarndh) and the "quatre castes" before deciding that the varnas are classes 4). Kosambi has come up with the "four 'original' castes", the "four primary class-castes", the "four-caste class system" and an even greater mystery, a "four-caste division into classes" 5). The dangers of translating varna in some such way should be apparent: It is implied that varna is jdti or a kind ofjdti. "Class" is by far and away the most acceptable translation for varna so far put forward. It suggests the economic nature of the groups, representing as they do the priesthood, nobility, bourgeoisie, and bondsmen. Yet for that very reason "class" is unsatisfactory: In Indian thought the varnas are not essentially economic but sacred, that is, immutable and of divine creation, as we have said above. To translate varna as "class" is to choose a term much too objective, scientific and modern to represent adequately the notion of varna. We should like to suggest the use of the word "order" or "estate". J. Huizinga remarks that the synonymous words "estate" and "order" had many i) Mdnavadharmaidstra x. 6-40. 2) I.

An extension of the idea of the divine institution of the orders is that of the greater sanctity of the higher orders as compared with the lower. "Now, if the degrees of the social edifice are conceived as the lower steps of the throne of the Eternal, the value assigned to each order will not depend on its utility, but on its sanctity-that is to say, its proximity to the highest place 2)." Another feature of the idea of the three estates, to which the regenerate varnas correspond, is that the third estate, the commons, rather arbitrarily lumps together people of diverse occupation and rank. We quote Prof. Huizinga again: "No distinction in principle was made, in the third estate, between rich and poor citizens, nor between townsmen and country-people. The figure of the poor peasant alternates indiscriminately with that of the wealthy burgher, but a sound definition of the economic and political functions of these different classes does not take shape 3)." These features of the medieval European notion of estate or order correspond to the Indian notion of varna. The divine creation of the four varnas as well as the idea of the differing degrees of sanctity adhering to them are made explicit in the myth of their creation from the mouth, arms, thighs, and feet of Purusa or Brahmd 4), and there can be no doubt that the vai.ya and .fdra varnas consisted and still consist of the most diverse economic groups and castes, including cultivators, artisans, merchants and even kings, so as to be all but meaningless categories from a sociological point of view. It must, ot course, be admitted that the European idea of the "three estates" came to have strong political connotations, being linked with the development of representative government. Such a connotation vartna has never had, and for that reason the use of the word order is perhaps preferable. But that medieval European thought provides us with a concept corresponding to an Indian concept should not surprise us, for there are other correspondences between the two cultures with respect to social thought. The derivation of the four varnas from the body of Purusa reminds one of the medieval European idea of the "body politic", the idea which John of Salisbury carried to its furthest possible extreme in his Policraticus, where he drew the following analogy, summed up by Gierke: "The servants of Religion are the Soul of the Body..., the prince is the head, the senate the heart, the court the sides, officers and judges are the eyes, ears, and tongue, the executive officials are the unarmed and the army is the armed hand, the financial department is belly and intestines, landfolk, handicraftsmen and the like are the feet, so that the State exceeds the centipede numerositate pedum; the pro- i) J. Huizinga, The Waning of the Middle Ages (Eng. ed.), London, 1924, pp. 47-8. 0. Gierke asserts that, when dealing with the origins of groups, the medieval mind always had recourse to the idea of divine creation rather than that of natural growth, "in accordance with its general view of the universe" (Political Theories of the Middle Ages, F. M. Maitland, trans., Cambridge, I900, p. 29). 2) Huizinga, op. cit., p. 48. 3) Ibid., p. 49. 4) Rg Veda x. 90o and Manavadharmaiastra i. 31.</page><page sequence="5">20z MISCELLANEA tection of the folk is the shoeing; the distress of these feet is the State's gout ... 1). The Indian arthaidstra literature often speaks of the seven angas or limbs of the state (rdjya), namely, the ruler (svdmin), minister (amdtya), land with its population (rds.tra or janapada), fort or capital (durga), treasury (kola), army (dayda) and ally (mitra). The idea that each element of the state and each order of society had a relationship to the whole analogous to the relationship between the organs of the body to the body as a whole is a major theme of traditional Indian social thought as it is of medieval European 2). Side by side with, and often contradicting the myth of the derivation of the four varnas from the body of Purusa, the dnti Parvan of the Mahdbhdrata and certain of the Purdnas declare that in the K.rtayuga (golden age) men lived in natural harmony, without kings, property or social distinctions. It is stated in the Bhdgavata Purdna (ix. 14-48) that in that age there was only one Veda, the word "Om"; one god, Nardyana; one Agni and one varna, and that the triple Veda, and presumably also the four varnas, came about with the coming of the Tretayuga, i.e. with the decline of human nature. Bhrgu in the Mahdbhdrata (2z.i81.i ff.) categorically states that there is no such thing as varna, that all the word was once brahmanic and that men became separated into the four varnas accordingly as they fell away from the study of the Vedas and clean occupations. Mahdbharata 12.5 9.1 ff. although silent on the lack of social distinctions during the golden age, says that men lived according to dharma and protected one another, and that there was neither king nor coercion (daynda). But error set in and human minds became clouded; anarchy showed its malevolent aspect. The gods, suffering from the dearth of sacrificial nourishment, petitioned Brahmd, who composed a treatise on kdma, artha, dharma, and moksa for the use of men. Prthu, a descendant of Visnu, took an oath from the rsis to uphold the Vedas, protect brdhmanas and prevent the mixture of varnas, becoming the first earthly king. The medieval European concept of the state of nature is strikingly similar to the Indian theory of the K.rtayuga and the origin of kingship, property and the estates. This concept may be traced back to Seneca and his "policy theory of the state", according to which when vice set in mankind fell from its primal innocence and founded the state to keep debased human nature in check. St. Irenaeus casts this theme into a Christian mould: men, living in the state of nature, turned away from God and fell a-fighting as a belated result of Adam's sin ; God therefore set some men over the rest to rule. "We have here," says A. J. Carlyle, "an explicit statement that the institution of government has been made necessary by sin, while it is also a divinely appointed remedy for sin 3)." This view of government, which enjoyed great authority in the Europe of the Middle Ages, is singularly Indian in spirit. In I) Op. cit., pp. 131-2, n. 76.

Thus if the notions of varn.a on the one hand and estate or order on the other correspond very closely it is only because of the broader similarities between tra- ditional Indian and medieval European thought : the great importance attached to the principle of hierarchy, the scholastic tendency to spin out involved analogies, the preference for the idea of divine creation over that of natural growth when speculating on the origin of things, and the idea of a fall from primordial innocence.
