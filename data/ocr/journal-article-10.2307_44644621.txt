General Motors Research Labs THE FORMULATIONS OF COMPUTER MODELS of automobile occupants, like the MVMA 2-D (1)* occupant simulator, are based on the same prin- ciples of mechanics that determine the responses of crash test dummies, like the 572 dummy (2), to a given set of mechanical inputs. Agreement be- tween dummy and model results is dependent on the accuracy and precision of the measured dummy responses and the fidelity of the model in represent- ing the dummies. The fidelity of the MVMA 2-D model in representing the response of a Part 572 dummy is a function of three factors: 1) The identification of the features of the dummies and their impact environment that determine their response, 2) the characterization of these physical features in the mathematical formulations and cal- culations of the model, and 3) the accurate and precise measurement of these features of the dummies and their environments for input into the model. We are concerned here with part of this *Numbers in parentheses designate References at the end of paper. third factor, the measured geometric, inertial, and joint characteristics of the two Part 572 dum- mies that are the basis for representation in the MVMA 2-D model. The MVMA 2-D model is a mathematical repre- sentation of links connected at pivots that are posi- tioned and move in a plane (Fig. 1). Except for the links that correspond to the neck and shoulder, each of the links is rigid and can be assigned a length, weight, center of gravity location, mass moment of inertia, and an ellipse by which forces of interaction between that link and a surface ex- ternal to the occupant model are generated. The neck and shoulder links are unique in that they are extensible and their mass must be concentrated at their ends. The joints in the MVMA 2-D model can be assigned linear and nonlinear stiffnesses with added capabilities for energy dissipation and fric- tional and velocity dependent resistances to motion. MATERIALS AND METHODS One of the Part 572 dummies used in the com- ABSTRACT The geometric, inertial, and joint characteris- tics of two Part 572 crash test dummies were mea- sured to provide input to the MVMA 2-D occupant model. Segments of the dummies were defined which correspond to the links of the model and coordinate axes were defined for each segment. The center of gravity of each segment was located and its coordinates were measured along with the locations of joint centers, instrument mounts, and other significant geometric features. The mass moment of inertia for each segment about a lateral axis through its center of gravity was measured. The geometric and inertial measurements are pre- sented on summary sheets for each segment with the hardware definition, coordinate system, and special notes for that particular segment. These summary sheets present the data in a format that is readily usable for defining computer model input. The resistance to motion of the elbows, shoulders, hips, and knees of the two dummies was measured and interpreted for input to the MVMA 2-D model. 3252 0096-736X/78/8604-3252$02.50 Copyright © 1978 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">S M1 V/ / / 2 J .7 / 9 M? M2 ^ IF M8 34 8 M3 ® 6 M4 -* 5 M5 ' M6 Fig. 1 - The links and joints of the MVMA 2D model parison with the MVMA 2-D model was manufactured by Sierra Engineering and the other by Alderson Research Laboratories. Both dummies were built to the same specification from NHTSA (2). The first task in characterizing these dummies for representation in the model was to break them down into segments and define the parts that were to be included in each segment. Using DOT drawing number SA 150M002 and a parts list, each dummy part was assigned to a particular segment. These segments are listed in Table 1 along with the links of the MVMA 2-D model that are comparable. Many of the dummy segments contain a joint such as those in the limbs that allow rotation about their long axis, and the shoulder is a complex of three joints. For each of these segments a unique configuration was defined based on the dummy posture shown in Fig. 2. So that these configurations could be specified for each segment and dimensional values could be measured with respect to a particular reference, coordinate axes systems were defined for each segment. These coordinate axes systems were TABLE 1 Segments of the Part 572 Crash Dumny and Comparable Links of the MVMA 2-D Model Mass and/or link in the MVMA 2-D Segment of the Part 572 Dummy Model (Refer to Fig. 1) Head ^ Neck Link between joints 1 and 2 Upper torso M2 and linkage including joints 2, 3, 7, and 9 Both shoulders (subsegments of upper torso) Link between joints 9 and 7 Both upper arms My and link between joints 7 and 8 Both lower arms and hands Mg and link distal from joint 8 Lumbar spine and abdomen Mg and link between joints 3 and 4 Lower torso M^ and link between joints 4 and 5 Both upper legs Mg and link between joints 5 and 6 Both lower legs and feet Mg and link distal from joint 6 defined with respect to features in the dummy hardware with their origins usually at joint centers. The axes coordinate directions for each segment were chosen to be approximately parallel to overall coordinate axes directions when the dummy is in the configuration shown in Fig. 2. The location of the center of gravity of each segment was determined using two steps. First, each segment was hung in a frame (Fig. 3) to which low power lasers were mounted with their beams dispersed into a plane of light by glass rods. By careful alignment of the frame, lasers, and glass rods, the light from the lasers is coplanar and in- cludes the centerline of the suspension fixture. The suspension of the segment is such that the center of gravity of that segment is in the plane of the laser light regardless of its orientation about a vertical axis. With the centerlines of the suspen- sion pins in the plane of light, the incidence of the laser light on the segment is marked. The segment was rotated a quarter turn and marked again three successive times. In this way the locations of orthogonal planes that contain the center of gravity of the segment were marked and checked. The intersection of these planes is a line that is through the center of gravity. A second step was used to locate the position of the center of gravity along the line of intersec- tion of the two planes as marked with the laser frame. The segment was placed on a table in a known orientation (Fig. 4) and the change in load to support the table was related to the position of 3253</page><page sequence="3">3254 R. P. HUBBARD AND D. G. MCLEOD ( M Fig. 2 - Seated posture and overall coordinate directions for assignment of coordinate directions in dummy segments center of gravity relative to the support. By these two techniques the center of gravity of each seg- ment was located within an accuracy of 1 mm. The mass moment of inertia about a lateral axis through its center of gravity of each dummy segment was measured using a torsional pendulum table (Fig. 5). With the location of the center of gravity known, the segment could be carefully aligned using a laser directed downward from above along the centerline of the pendulum table. For the dummy segments measured in this study, the accuracy of mass moment of inertia was better than 1%. The resistances to rotation of the elbow, knee, and hip joints were measured by constraining one segment with a frictionless pivot that was colinear with the joint axis and a connection through a load cell to a rigid support and by moving the adjoining segment (Fig. 6). The joint rotation was mea- sured with a rotary potentiometer that was coaxial Fig. 3 - Frame for locating planes containing the center of gravity of a dummy segment</page><page sequence="4">OCCUPANT MODELING 3255 i Dummy Segment m V ļ ?Z J 1 V ļ J Adjustable Support li1 y' zv I rn^.

The fixtures for the elbows and knees were like Fig. 6 and were simple in comparison to the fixture for the hips (Fig. 7) in which each leg was attached to a plate that was supported separately by a pivot through the hip joint center and a load cell near each knee. The resistances to motion of the shoulders were measured by constraining the chest structure, applying loads through a load cell to the most lateral joint center in the shoulder structure, and measuring the movement of the shoulder in line with the load. The loads were applied forward and rearward as shown in Fig. 8A and upward and downward, relative to the chest as shown in Fig. 8B. The elbows, shoulders, hip, and knees can be adjusted to offer various levels of frictional resistance to motion. The joints were tested for a range of frictional resistances from zero to the maximum possible within the limits of our ability to apply the necessary test loads. RESULTS So that the geometric and inertial measure- ments could be presented for convenient use and interpretation as input to the MVMA 2-D model (or any other occupant model), data sheets for each segment were developed. The data sheets for the Sierra and Alderson Dummies are Figs. 9 - 23. Included on these sheets are, in most cases, all of the measurements needed to define the geo- metric and inertial characteristics of a planar occupant model such as the MVMA 2-D model. Additional geometric data may be needed to define the character and placement of the surfaces used in the model to simulate the contact of the dummy with objects external to the dummy. The resistance to motion of the joints is typically as shown in Fig. 22. Between the ex- tremes of joint motion there is a nominally linear region of joint motion versus resistance. As the extremes are approached, the resistance increases nonlinearly with increased joint movement. Upon return from the maximum excursion, the resistance offered by the joint is commonly less than that required for the loading of the joint. This indi- cates energy dissipation. Superimposed on the linear and nonlinear response is the resistance offered by friction. Also there is a possibility that the resistance to joint motion is dependent on rate of motion. For the purposes of this study, the measured resistances to joint motions were interpreted in terms of the inputs possible with the MVMA 2-D model. That model will accept joint descriptions as shown in Fig. 23 that are linear over a region then nonlinear as represented by addition of second and third order functions of joint motion. Energy dissipation in the nonlinear region is accounted for by a scale factor, R, which is the ratio of areas as shown in Fig. 23. Friction is considered to be a constant level of force or torque that opposes motion and is superimposed on the other components of resistance. The MVMA 2-D model can also accommodate joint resistances that are velocity dependent or a function of time. All of the joints tested in this</page><page sequence="5">3256 R. P. HUBBARD AND D. G.

MCLEOD study, the elbow, shoulder, hip, and knee, were loaded over a range of rates that could be applied by hand with the full range of motion occurring from less than one second to several seconds. In all cases, the variation in measured responses for these different rates was small and within the variation seen between repeated tests at the same rate. The capability for temporal variation of joint resistance in the MVMA 2-D model is for simulation of muscle response in biological sys- tems and was not considered relevant in the inter- pretation of dummy responses. For the elbow, hip, and knee, the joint resis- tances are torques and the motions are angles measured about axes through respective joint centers and perpendicular to a sagittal plane. In the ;houlder, the joint resistance is force that results from linear displacement. As shown in Fig. 23, the MVMA 2-D model considers the joints that were tested in this study to respond symmet- rically in that the coefficients that represent the nonlinear portions of the responses are the same for both ends. In the dummies, the responses at the opposite extremes of motion are different so that a different set of coefficients must be deter- mined from the measured responses at each end. The results from analyzing the measured joint responses in terms of the MVMA 2-D model are given in Tables 2-5. The parameters given in these tables are illustrated in Fig. 23. For the knees, hips, and elbows, the joint motions and resistances are angles and torques. The motions and resistances for the and joints of the shoulders are displacements and forces. All of the joints tested in this study can be adjusted to provide a frictional resistance to motion. Often these joints are set to just offset the tendency of the dummy to move under the in- fluence of its own weight which is called a "lg" setting. The frictional torques necessary for the "lg" setting can be calculated from the geometric and inertial characteristics of the dummies. In the course of our study, we varied the frictional resistance of the joints from zero, or nearly so, through the "lg" setting, to levels several times the "lg" setting. Invariably, the effect of the friction was to add a constant level of resistance throughout the range of joint motion. DISCUSSION The data presented in Figs. 9-21 were mea- sured using coordinate systems that were defined in each dummy segment. These coordinate sys- tems were based on features of the hardware with primary importance given to convenience of making the measurements. In using these data for the generation of input to an occupant model that simu- lates the dummies, it is essential that the defini- tions of the origins and coordinate directions be well understood to reduce the possibility of errors. Segmentation of the dummies was done so that dummy segments were grouped to correspond to the links in the model.

Also, the geometric features of segments of the dummies selected for measure- ment, particularly the dummy joint centers, correspond to similar features of the model. This correspondence between dummy and model joint centers is most apparent for the knees, hips, elbows and shoulders. The hips are ball joints and the others are pin joints in the dummy. All are represented as simple pivots in the planer model. For the rubber cylinders of the dummy neck and lumbar spine, the correspondence be- tween dummy and model joints is less apparent. Modeling these segments by prescribing joints in the model to coincide with the ends of these continuously deformable segments may not repre- sent their internal mobility in the most accurate manner. The characterization of the neck and lumbar in terms of the MVMA 2-D model is being done by modeling crash tests in which these seg- ments are loaded in a well controlled manner. These results will be reported in a subsequent paper.</page><page sequence="15">3266 R. P. HUBBARD AND D. G.

In using measurements of weight distribution given here for model input, the addition of items such as accelerometers or photographic targets should be considered. These items can be ac- counted for by noting any differences between the dummy as it might be tested and the dummy seg- ment definitions given here and then appropriately modifying the inertial characteristics used as in- put to the model. In using the values of joint characteristics given in Tables 2-5 for input to the MVMA 2-D model, two differences between that model and the dummies must be considered. First, the model has one arm and one leg to represent the two arms and two legs of the dummies. The measured dummy characteristic must be averaged and then doubled to yield input for the model. The second difference is that the nonlinear responses of the dummy joints at opposite ends of the ranges of movement are not the same. This is evident from the magnitudes of the joint parameters for the upper and lower extremes in Table 2 and 3, e. g. , the cubic coefficients for the elbows. In the model, the joints are considered to be symmetrical in their response. In the absences of data from many dummies of the Part 572 specification, the measurements included in this report could be used to represent Part 572 dummies in general. Use of these data in that way must be done with the clear understand- ing that two dummies do not make an adequate sample to infer properties of other Part 572 dum- mies in general or any single dummy in particular. The data presented here are intended as a basis for input to the MVMA 2-D model. That model is two-dimensional and the dummies are obviously three-dimensional. All of the geometric measurements for each dummy segment, including the center of gravity, were taken and presented in three dimensions and can be used to generate in- put into a three-dimensional crash simulator. For each segment the mass moment of inertia about a lateral axis through its center of gravity was mea- sured which is sufficient for the two-dimensional representation of the dummy. If the dummies are to be modeled with a three-dimensional occupant simulator, the other moments and the products of inertia will have to be measured. The joints that were characterized in this study control the mo- tions in the sagittal plane of the dummies. To model these dummies in three dimensions, the joints that allow motion out of a sagittal plane must be characterized. SUMMARY The results of this study are measurements of geometric, inertial, and joint characteristics of two Part 572 crash test dummies that can be used for representing these dummies with the MVMA 2-D occupant simulator. These results include the locations of joint centers and other geometric features significant to modeling the dummies, the location of the center of gravity, the value of mass moment of inertia about a lateral axis through the center of gravity for each segment of the dummies, and measurements of the resistance to motion of their elbows, shoulders, hips, and knees. The geometric and inertial measurements taken on each segment are summarized on data sheets which in-</page><page sequence="16">OCCUPANT MODELING 3267 elude a hardware definition of the dummy segment and the axis system used in taking the measure- ments.
