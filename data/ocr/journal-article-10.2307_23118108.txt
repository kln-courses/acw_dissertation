<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT STOREY Comedy, Its Theorists, and the Evolutionary Perspective Researchers today in the various life-sciences are gradually uniting in a consensus about the importance of evolution as their guiding conceptual paradigm, not only for the elucidation of physiological facts deducible about particular organisms, but also for the explana tion of behavioral facts, including those about the human animal.1 With very few exceptions—most notably, Joseph Carroll, whose Evo lution and Literary Theory marks a revolutionary advance in the field —theorists of literature continue to work in ignorance of this devel opment, mired deeply in the ruts of "constructivist" thinking, a kind of thinking that, in its radical hostility to biology, runs counter to everything that behavioral genetics (to name only one among a score of relevant disciplines) is uncovering about human life. Evolutionists have come to understand that, if the human being is ever to be cor rectly understood, it must be seen within the continuum of the mam malian order, and must be acknowledged, moreover, to share much of its motivational structure with its phylogenetically close—that is, primate—kin. In short, it must be regarded as an evolved organism, one whose robust behaviors exhibit a definable relationship to those of other members of its hominoid family, and announce, in addition, their adaptive origins, as once having served the ends of survival and reproduction. The evolutionist begins with what Stephen Jay Gould calls the highest "principle" of nature: "Natural selection dictates that organ isms act in their own self-interest. They know nothing of such ab stract concepts as 'the good of the species.' They 'struggle' continuously to increase the representation of their genes at the ex pense of their fellows. And that, for all its baldness, is all there is to it; we have discovered no higher principle in nature."2 Here, in brief are the main tenets of evolutionary theory, all as applicable to the human animal as to any other organism: First, the general mecha nisms and manifestations of behavior, including, for Homo, not only the emotions but also such reflexes as laughing and crying, have evolved as instruments through which the physical and social world may be mastered. Second, although "self-interest" may be said to Criticism, Summer 1996, Vol. XXXVIII, No. 3, pp. 407-441 Copyright © 1996 Wayne State University Press, Detroit, MI 48201 407</page><page sequence="2">408 Robert Storey motivate such mastery—it is the word that Gould uses here—the "atomic" self must not always be inferred: as Gould points out, the "struggle" among organisms is the struggle "to increase the represen tation of their genes at the expense of their fellows." Often, indeed, this means a struggle to advance the interests of the individual (what I'll later refer to as "phenotypic" interests) in the pursuit of mastery or "fitness." But, because genetic representation is what is at issue, the "fitness" of all organisms is now understood by evolutionary theo rists to mean "inclusive fitness." In other words, the "fittest" organ ism in the struggle for life is that organism whose genes are, in the population at large, most numerously represented—not only in "self" but also in offspring and other close kin. It follows, then, that among the successful adaptations of a sexual organism—and, in the case of the human being, a highly social one—are those that can override purely phenotypic interests in favor, when appropriate, of conjuga tion and cooperation. Thus the paradox of Homo sapiens: the "selfishness" of its genes inclines it naturally not only towards com petition with its fellows but also towards love and (a usually pru dent) altruism. Such a model of the human being has obvious implications for the study of literature; in this essay, I'll try to show its specific implica tions for a single literary genre, comedy. I choose this genre for a number of reasons: First, conflicting "theories" of comedy abound, and yet, once an evolutionary (and empiricist) perspective is brought to bear upon them, not only do their strengths and shortcomings be come clear but a new unitary overview emerges. Second, the enigma of laughter is demystified by this overview, specifically by reference to the homologues of laughter in the so-called lower primates. And, third, comedy offers a particularly lucid illustration of the paradox of the human animal as I have described it above. In what has been identified as its "contradictory" tendencies—towards laughter on the one hand and union on the other—it dramatizes, as I shall argue, the spectacle of human "self-interest" in the more powerful throes of the selfish gene. Where should the evolutionary theorist begin in an investigation of the ancient genres, either of tragedy or of comedy? With Dionysiac revelry and the birth of Attic theater from what Aristotle calls crypti cally "the leaders of the dithyramb"? George Steiner responds to this best: "To locate the sources of western drama, of all theatrical arts anywhere, in ritual, in mimetic ceremonies of a liturgical-civic char</page><page sequence="3">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 40L&gt; acter, is to focus on a late and formal phase." And he concludes that "the original source of the dramatic lies in the paradox of con flict. . . ."3 It's a paradox that antedates all conceptual expressions of it. Thus the confusion of a logic like Gilbert Murray's that engrafts the tragic action—the fall of the hero—upon the decline of sun and seasons. It seems much more likely that early Homo latched upon the spectacle of the natural cycles as both explanation and justification of the primordial agon: the displacement of one alpha male by another. Conflict, as Steiner says, was first; there then followed, in the minds of big-brained creatures growing ever more conscious of the history of themselves, a narrative in which both natural and sacred prece dent emerged to legitimize their social transactions. The usurper triumphed not only by "natural" legitimacy, as the spring inevitably overpowers the winter, but also by virtue of being a god. (And, if the narrative was to be convincing, it had to be consistent, which meant that the defeated was divine as well.) From this point, all manner of elaboration was possible: the "gods" were not two, but essentially one, a Year-Spirit who was, in Murray's words, "first new and then old, first pure and then polluted,"4 but who rises from his sickness, mutilation, and death in a theophanic glory. Then, like all "memes" (Richard Dawkins' word for cultural "replicators," which multiply themselves like genes),5 this narrative combined with other myths, and the resultant theology (which inspired, admittedly, the "late and formal" phases of drama) gradually floated free of its source. But we err to confound the two, either for tragedy or for comedy. Francis Cornford, following out Murray's speculations, goes back only so far, as Murray does, as the late elaborations, concluding that the "ritual" of comedy, like the theophany of tragedy, arises chiefly from "the renewal of life in spring."6 Northrop Frye reaches a slightly more sophisticated conclusion. For him, comedy comes from ritual, with its source in the seasons, but beneath spring's tubers clutch Freudian roots: "The fact that the son and father [of romantic com edy] are so often in conflict means that they are frequently rivals for the same girl, and the psychological alliance of the hero's bride and the mother is often expressed or implied."7 What I am suggesting is that we seek out a source in neither the "mythic" nor the (spuriously) fantasmatic8 of Homo's early conceptual life, but in its—largely pre linguistic—"social dramas" (to use Victor Turner's phrase), the most important of which for the narrativizing male was the perennial con test for dominance. Surely that contest is more plausibly behind what Frye calls the "total mythos of comedy" than Freud's dubious oedipal</page><page sequence="4">410 Robert Storey drama. Boy is blocked from getting girl, not because he and his fa ther are "frequently" rivals, but because the girl is of the sort that promises no extension of his father's inclusive fitness, at least as far as wealth and reputation are concerned. New Comedy (which pro vides, in Frye's words, the formulaic "basis for most comedy" [163]) throws this aspect of the plot in relief: the girl in question is of dis reputable origins—a slave girl, a "flute girl" an orphan or waif—and it's not till it's discovered that she's of a "good" family that the hero receives her hand. Certainly the resolution, at least of romantic comedy, translates the action to a conceptual plane, since that resolution seems born of an insistent male wish (and a wish, significantly, of the usurper): that the hero of New Comedy should get his girl, often irrespective of what that girl should want or think or feel. Roman theatrical conven tion tended to ensure that she had little say in the matter: in the Phor mio, for example, the play by Terence that seems most representative of New Comedy as a whole, neither the girl nor the love-interest of the young hero's friend ever puts in an appearance on the stage. Later comic dramatists (Shakespeare, most familiarly) will smite both partners with a passion, but how fundamentally superfluous is such motivic scrupulosity is suggested by modern successes in the older vein—Mike Nichols' film The Graduate, for example, whose Elaine has the tractability of doll or dream. Such pieces work (at least for the male members of its audience) because comedy has precisely the opposite of that appeal described epigrammatically by Horace Wal pole: The world is a comedy, not to those that think, but in fact to those that feel. Unlike tragedy, which encourages what neurologist William Calvin calls "scenario-spinning,"9 moral exercises of the imagination that its Lears and its Creons neglect, comedy forestalls the thoughtful response. "Comedy usually moves toward a happy ending, and the normal response of the audience to a happy ending is," as Frye writes, "'this should be' . . (167). The affiliative specta cles that conclude most comedies—where, as Aristotle puts it, "the bitterest enemies . . . exit as friends at the conclusion, and nobody kills anyone else"10—arouse (for reasons that I'll offer later) a plea sure that recoils at analysis. Unions in comedy can be flimsily moti vated; they're sufficiently justified by the feeling they excite. For the medieval audience, as Nevill Coghill has argued, the affili ative spectacle of comedy was primary. A comedy was not—as it was earlier for Aristophanes, or would later be for the moralists of the Renaissance—a show inviting "corrective" laughter, but "a tale of</page><page sequence="5">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 411 trouble that turned to joy."11 So Dante conceived his Commedia: "Comedy," he wrote to his dedicatee, Can Grande, "begins with the harshness of some affair (asperitatem alicuius rei) but its matter ends happily (prospere) as appears by Terence and his Comedies. . . ,"12 Shakespeare, writes Coghill, continued the tradition, implying in his plays that—pace Ben Jonson—"the harmonious is the normal, the at tainable," and that "life is a union in love, not a battle of self-interest waged by the rules of an expedient ethic."13 Perhaps because of the authority that Shakespeare (thus interpreted) wields in the English speaking world, this view has entered some of our most influential theory—Frye's, for example, in which comedy primarily (in T. G. A. Nelson's words) "moves towards joy, reconciliation, and new begin nings," and in which "the element of laughter" is underplayed: "at times [the Anatomy of Criticism] seems to merge comedy into the re lated mode of romance."14 Indeed, not only does Frye emphasize the festivity of comedy, its "tendency ... to include as many people as possible in its final society" (Frye, 165), but he also imagines that "society" as transcendently, mythically "new" (163), an assertion that seems applicable to only a minority of comic texts. True, hero and heroine bring their youth to their union, but this rarely raises a new heaven or a new earth. Frye's view—and Coghill's on Shakespeare, as I shall argue—illustrates the seductiveness of the feeling with which comedy concludes, a seductiveness that robs the spectator of the power of analysis that may make something rather different of the comic world. But we must approach our subject crabwise. If we are to under stand fully the comic denouement, we first should investigate the na ture of the response that, like the happy ending, seems a sufficient (though not necessary) determinant of comedy: the laugh or, related ly, the smile. About laughter—and humor, a slightly separate issue— a great deal has already been written, of course, but much, if not most, of it can be set aside, especially that produced by literary crit ics. As Paul Lewis points out in his Comic Effects, "in our time, the study of humor in literature continues to be shaped by two dated and, therefore, limiting methodologies. On one side are critics who derive their conceptual frameworks from an early universalist theory that has been either discredited or subsumed in the past thirty years. On the other side are critics who see no reason to refer to humor re search or theory at all."15 And then there are critics who concoct theo ries of their own, usually on the authority of native instinct or of a "philosophical" thinker more current and "advanced" than Hobbes</page><page sequence="6">412 Robert Storey or Kant or Freud. And so George McFadden formulates an "essence of the comic" by standing Bergson on his head ("The essence of the comic ... is founded in a being that shows the power of continuing as itself, substantially unchanged, while overcoming a force or forces that would substantially alter it"16—as fine a description of Camus' Caligula as of any comic type); or John Morreall proposes a new "formula" for laughter that exceeds in comprehensiveness all pre vious theories—and that will long stand as a triumph of the self-evi dent ("Laughter Results from a Pleasant Psychological Shift");17 or Susan Purdie brings the fantasticated dogma of Lacanian "theory" to the task of explicating the "joke-work" ("joking paradigmatically in volves a discursive exchange whose distinctive operation involves the marked transgression of the Symbolic Law . . ,").18 The persistence of this sort of theorizing about comedy—theorizing that merely flirts with empirical fact (if it flirts with it at all)—is illus trated by the most recent contender in the theoretical lists, Dana F. Sutton's The Catharsis of Comedy. Its discussion quickly gravitates to wards one of the bibles of literary theorists, Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, although Sutton is perceptive enough to admit Freud's considerable shortcomings: . . in its expressed form," he writes, "Freud's theory is liable to accusations of being unclearly stat ed, difficult to understand, needlessly complicated, and generally implausible." ("Even within the framework of orthodox psychoanaly tic theory," he adds, "it does not seem like a particularly successful piece of reasoning.")19 But he goes on to salvage from his own cri tique what he calls "a certain highly valuable residue" in that theory (29). This is Freud's notion of "psychic energy" that is "vented" by the laughing subject. "Someday," writes Sutton, "a description of laughter can be devised to which a physiologist, a psychologist, and a literary critic can subscribe with equal enthusiasm. Such a theory, I am sure, will contain some component roughly equivalent to 'the dis charge of psychic energy' to describe laughter's subjective effect . . (19). I, on the other hand, am sure that it won't. The model of the mind emerging from the cognitive sciences (and especially from the cogni tive neurosciences) over the last twenty years or so seems to give lit tle support to Freud's hydraulic metaphors and, specifically, to such notions as "psychic energy." As for his specific idea that humor re sults in a "free discharge" of "liberated energy,"20 an idea derived from the imagined operations of his pseudoscientific "cathexes" and their "undoing," it has not stood up to empirical testing. Arousal is</page><page sequence="7">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 413 increased, not decreased, by humor, and it's possible that laughter re sults directly from this increase instead of causing the subsequent decline.21 Still less support does all this promise to Sutton's own final conclusions: that laughter is a "purgative," relieving the spectator of various "bad feelings" and encouraging an attitude of "disdain" to wards its "targets," generating thereby "a kind of antitoxin that in hibits the target's capacity to induce bad feelings in the future" (44). The argumentative contortions in defense of this position are rather painful to witness. First, we're told that, "very much in the spirit of homeopathic medicine, it is necessary to impose a careful limit on the size of the [inoculatory] dose"—in other words, on the intensity of the "bad feel ings" evoked by the comic target: If this were not done, there would exist the danger that the bad feelings evoked by the surrogate might prove too strong to be purged effectively. Under these conditions, comedy would backfire and have the counterproductive effect of making the spectator feel worse rather than better. The pres ence of ridiculousness [defined previously as "the quality that makes things strike us as funny" (38)] is one of what will prove to be a number of comic strategies to ensure that this does not happen. (42-43) And yet earlier we have been informed that tragic catharsis (which is credited with the same homeopathic effects) "produces pleasure" in the spectator (10), though it obviously does nothing to moderate the "dose" of its pathos. Why, then, should the "bad feelings" evoked by comedy (which for Sutton include pity and fear) threaten to make the spectator feel worse rather than better? Contradictions like this tend to plague the argument. "There are various specific ways," Sutton declares with confidence, "in which the spectator can feel superior to surrogates," and one is through the "moral deficiency of comic characters" (57). But, immediately, this ground begins to crumble: "Moral deficiencies that mark characters on the comic stage," we read two pages later, "are many and various, but since we are not always invited to pass a negative judgment on these qualities, it is not self-evident that their presence is always cal culated to induce an attitude of superiority in the spectator" (59). This scruple should not detain us, however: after another thirty pages it is simply forgotten and the reader is assured with a "certain ly": "Certainly, fraud, pretense, and hypocrisy are moral shortcom</page><page sequence="8">414 Robert Storey ings; and so here is one way in which the spectator can perceive the target ... as inferior to himself" (91). Nagging doubts about the central thesis must be evaded in a foot note. "Obviously," Sutton writes towards the end of his book, "satire teaches us to disdain and dislike its targets, or more precisely the moral deficiencies its targets embody, and so presents a parallel to those components of comedy's ridicule process that perform a similar function. But whether there is any element of purging bad feelings seems questionable: what bad feelings could these be? So is there any such thing as satiric catharsis?" (115n). Thus the note concludes. We're not really encouraged to answer the question because an an swer will level the whole edifice. If it is "yes"—there is such a thing as a satiric catharsis—then Sutton must concede that the purging of bad feelings has nothing to do with it. If it is "no"—there is no such thing as a satiric catharsis—then he must concede that satire is not a species of comedy. Neither concession can be made, of course, and so, after a glimpse into the argumentative abyss, the reader is sum moned out of the note into the more authoritative text, much as a sightseer who's wandered too close to a chasm is called back by the guide who is eager to repair his own lapse in responsibility. But the alert reader would have long entertained suspicions about this guide's authority. Is laughter really a purgative of "bad feel ings"? What sorts of bad feelings are being "purged" by the spectacle of Chaplin's making his hard rolls dance? or by one of Kramer's fre netic entrances on Seinfeld? or by Garth's addressing an enormous and elaborately festooned cocktail in the interview scene of Wayne's World? And why assume that characters in comedy are always re garded with "disdain"? The wit, as I shall argue, is a staple of com edy, and the humor it excites is not always disdainful—not always at the expense of a stooge. Roseanne needn't denigrate her admittedly numerous targets for her one-liners to have their effect. Finally, what is it that makes things strike us as funny? To call it "ridiculousness" is like explaining fire by phlogiston: wherein lies the ridiculousness of the ridiculous?22 To answer these questions, we must give Freud a wide berth, as we must to the other philosophers of comedy (to me Freud is more philosopher than psychologist). In keeping with my evolutionary par adigm, I'll approach laughter and smiling—universal reactions of human beings to specifiable classes of stimuli—as evolved responses of an apparently adaptive kind. I'll argue that they both have a pro vocative phylogenetic history, a history that may, in part, be recuper</page><page sequence="9">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 415 ated from a study of Homo's close primate kin. And I'll assume that the most reliable findings on laughter (and smiling, as well as the humor to which both are a response) are those that are cumulative in the advancement of our knowledge, which is to say, those that have been winnowed by the self-correcting labors of responsible scientific research. Of all the comic theorists with whom literary critics are acquaint ed, Bergson comes closest to a plausible theory of laughter, mainly because he develops the latter along ostensibly adaptationist lines. But Bergson was working with group-selectionist assumptions, that is, notions of adaptation as benefiting the group in direct, and not merely secondary, ways. Laughter, he writes, "pursues a utilitarian aim of general improvement"; it expresses "a special lack of adapta bility to society" and counters it with a social "corrective," singling out and repressing "a special kind of absentmindedness in men and in events."23 Evolution doesn't proceed in this way, however: selec tion ultimately benefits the gene, and functionally it usually benefits the phenotype; its benefit to the group is an incidental affair. So while Bergson often happens upon valuable observations, his concep tual framework is basically flawed. All the new findings argue for an approach to our subject along rigorous—that is to say, contemporary —theoretical lines. The fact, for example, that laughter "disturbs one of life's most basic . . . activities," causing "a consistent and complete disruption of the usual physiological respiratory cycle," leads Wil liam F. Fry, Jr., to conclude that it has survived in the human behav ioral repertoire for phenotypically adaptive reasons.24 Some of those reasons can be suggested by reference to the homo logues of laughter in the chimpanzee. Darwin noted in his Expression of the Emotions that, "if a young chimpanzee be tickled ... a .. . de cided chuckling or laughing sound is uttered/'25 and modern etholo gists have linked these vocalizations, as well as the "relaxed open mouth display" with which they're accompanied (fig. 1), to the "mock-fighting and chasing involved in social play."26 Human in fants exhibit the same kind of responses to tickling, play-chasing, mock-attacking, and also peek-a-boo. The "themes" of these games, observes Thomas R. Shultz, are "abandonment by the . . . caretaker in the case of peek-a-boo and predatory attack in the cases of tickling and chasing." The arousal they excite—not to be confused with Sut ton's "bad feelings," since, within a certain context and below a cer tain threshold, that arousal is experienced as pleasurable—has evolved to counter these threats to survival. Indeed, even today, the</page><page sequence="10">416 Robert Storey 1.

It's recontextualized through the assurance that the threat is not real, an assurance con veyed by the smiles and predictable movements of the caretaker. And from this conceptual shift follow pleasure and laughter, signal ing acknowledgment by the infant that the game is just a game. (But an adaptively valuable game, nevertheless: the playfully responsive infant is an alert, well-exercised, and so fitness-promoting infant.) Why the smile should serve as effective reassurance may, again, be answered by the primatologist. Its origin is, doubtless, the "bared teeth display," which in primates has both a vocalized and an unvo calized manifestation. The vocalized display (which in humans persists in the baring of teeth during fits of screaming or shouting in rage) is a reaction to "some threat or strong aversive stimulation": in monkeys it "may be regarded as a preparedness to bite, should the attacker suddenly advance," and so may be assumed to have devel oped in the "higher" primates "into a signal of general frustration and excitement" (van Hooff, 213, 214, 215). The "silent bared-teeth" face or "fear-grin" (fig. 1), however, communicates submissiveness in most higher primates, and its display, in some species, from domi nant to subordinate suggests that it may function "as a reassuring signal or even as a sign of attachment in these species" (van Hooff, 215). Human smiling probably originated in this particular display, evolving into a general "invitation to bond,"28 a gesture as useful be tween human strangers as between infant and caregiving adult. Although laughter and smiling, as the foregoing suggests, seem to have had different origins, both "have converged to a considerable extent in Homo" (van Hooff, 212; fig. 2). In some situations, obvious ly, they are not interchangeable: the smile suggests "sympathy, reas surance, or appeasement" (van Hooff, 227) less ambiguously than does the laugh. But often smiling seems a kind of "low-intensity laughter" (van Hooff, 227), especially in the nonsocial contexts for which both have evolved. In nonhuman primates, the facial displays and vocalizations that I've described seem restricted to social nego tiation and play, but in humans they have been extended to acts of mastery involving the physical and cognitive domains as well.

Although the smile continues to have this mean ing (and effect), certain theorists such as Kagan (1971)—and Piaget before, and McGhee (1979) after—have attempted to interpret smiling as a sign of rudimentary understanding brought about by an infant's growing ability to assimilate an originally unfamiliar event to an existing schema. Under this interpretation the smile means: "I've understood or mastered something I originally found strange or puzzling." This smile of recognition, or mastery, signals the end of a problem and thereby seems more related to a triumphant laugh than to the bonding smile that often transpires between the younger infant and his or her parent.29 Shultz proposes that this "pleasure in mastery represents a primitive stage of humour,"30 since humor theory based upon empirical re search now recognizes the importance of mastery in dealing with the incongruity of jokes. But before taking up joking and wit in general we should pause over the paradoxes of the ethological findings. Both laughter and smiling seem to have evolved out of signals inseparable from agonis tic encounters, the laugh closely tied to predatory attack, the smile to displays of both defensiveness and fear. Both emerged, in other words, from protective responses, which preserved the organism (and so advanced its interests), and yet both evolved into "nonagonistic signals" (van Hooff, 230, my italics), the laugh into a pleasurable acknowledgment of safety during bouts of boisterous "mock-aggression or play" (van Hooff, 235), the smile into a gesture of friendliness and appeasement. Both are ways of either expressing or inviting a form of social relation that allows one superordinance or autonomy (i.e., mastery) without risking the injury or defeat of con flict. And both are, suggestively, close to anger and tears. Mary K. Rothbart's "model for laughter" (fig. 3) explains why the closeness of the relationship still holds. Any sudden, intense, or discrepant stimu lus may lead, she observes, to laughter or smiling, but, if the stimu lus is such that it's judged to be dangerous, then fight- or flight responses usually ensue—if not avoidance or anger, then perhaps tears of distress. "Incongruities experienced in a safe or playful set ting" can lead, on the other hand, to arousal and approach,31 and a resolution of the discrepancies—physical, visual, verbal—will subse quently result in laughter or smiles.</page><page sequence="14">SUDDEN, INTENSE,OH OISCREPANT STIMULATION G O Oh O) n I ctJ X, m u •" P !3 " £&gt; u -C S o -C C6 60 3 ; -S c C .2 o * "q3 3 ^ £ o « £ x!

In a 1992 article in the journal Humor, the cognitive psychologist Giov annantonio Forabosco offers some of the most important refinements to date: "A stimulus is incongruous," he suggests, "when it differs from the cognitive model of reference,"33 that model approximating the categorical "prototype" in Eleanor Rosch's theory of categoriza tion.34 "Generally speaking," Forabosco observes, "a cognitive model does not define characteristics given in a predetermined way; rather it delineates the field of variation within which the characteristics of the stimulus must fall in order to be perceived as conforming and hence congruous" (54-55). So just as different cultures have different categorical prototypes—a "pet" is a dog for a resident of Pennsylvan ia, a dove or a fish for a Thai—so those cultures (as well as the sub cultures within them, and the age-groups within the subcultures) will have different models of reference for processing "discrepant" stimuli. But all cultures (and ages) will process those stimuli in ex actly the same way. As in the generation of mental categories, the perception of an incongruity and its resolution (or "mastery") by an alternative "congruence criterion" occur both unconsciously and more or less instantaneously: "the congruence aspect," Forabosco writes, "is not normally brought to the awareness of the subject: it remains, as it were, in the background, almost like a mental net pro tecting the subject from cognitive 'recklessness'" (58). Furthermore, congruence and incongruity are grasped "in a uniconfigurational way": "we might say that at the end we have a congruent incongruity" (58, 59). The adaptive advantage of assimilating incongruities into diverse behavioral and cognitive systems—and, in doing so, extend ing intellectual reach—accounts, undoubtedly, for the pleasure of this paradox or, in plainer terms, the funniness of a joke. Comic "thinking" is averse to Aristotelian logic (since "A" is both "A" and "not-A"), and so, not surprisingly, it's apparently the prov ince of the right side of the brain. Theorist Paul E. McGhee points out that "data from the limited number of humor studies completed with individuals with right- or left-hemisphere damage are consistent with the view that it is the right hemisphere that performs the insightful integration of the key elements of information that must be meaning</page><page sequence="16">422 Robert Storey fully linked before the humor can be understood and appreciated" (30). Predictably, given this lateralized processing, men and women react differently to humor, women monitoring their own laughter more closely before making a judgment about funniness, perhaps a "manifestation of a general trend toward females taking their own expressive reactions into account in making judgments about events" (McGhee, 23). Even more significant is McGhee's suggestion that, be cause humor is processed by the hemisphere that lacks what Michael Gazzaniga calls an "interpreter,"35 there may be some substance to "the common observation that trying to analyze or explain humor in terferes with funniness" (32). Similarly, there may be substance to Freud's familiar claim that the "unconscious" is plumbed in humor— if we adopt the idea of some neuropsychologists that equates right hemisphere processing with unconscious thought.36 Humor offers a way of bringing to light, not an "infantile type of thought-activity,"37 but antagonisms inherent in human behavior (and perhaps deeply imprinted on this more "primitive" hemisphere) that reasoned—i.e., left-brain—analysis would usually pronounce unworthy of their pro fessors. Thus the easy gravitation of humor towards sexist and ethnic jokes; thus, too, the incompatibility of firmly held values with humor that seeks congruence in their shameless (but often witless) transgres sion. "Take my wife . . . please!" is not funny to a female Significant Other. But to insist, as some theorists have, that humor is "fun damentally" transgressive (or liberating) is to simplify a complex is sue. "Joking," as Lewis writes, "can not only express but also support and advance destructive ideologies and political programs." On the other hand, as [Lawrence] La Fave and [Roger] Man nell have shown, in other circumstances ethnic jokes can be harmless or socially beneficial. Sociologists of humor have demonstrated that we cannot conclude a priori that humor in general is harmless, or liberating or oppressive. . . . Insofar as the sociological study of humor is now based on the observa tion that humor serves many social functions, an awareness of sociological research can give the student of comedy not "one idea of laughter" but a complex sense of the multiple uses of humor . . .: a sense that humor can be innocent, in Freud's sense of the word, or tendentious, hostile or benign, oppressive or revolutionary, that it can support or undermine accepted norms, that it both highlights and dismisses incon gruities.38</page><page sequence="17">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 423 Comedy, also, can be and do these things, and to hold it accountable to a "truth" about life is an obviously misguided project. "Comedy," we're told (in italics, of course), "is an amusing, relatively discontinuous action concerning success and failure in social relations and culminating in a judgement whereby the 'divine average' triumphs over the exceptional or peculiar."39 The first part of that sentence seems reasonable enough (although there are many comedies that are neither amusing nor dis continuous, and "physical comedy"—say, Chaplin on rollerskates— needn't be about "social relations"), but that comedy culminates in the triumph of the "average" is a judgment of doubtful validity. In what sense, for example, is Ubu Roi "average"? And, if he is not, are the plays in which he appears not comedies? Again: comedy is "the joyous consciousness of our finitude, the capacity to be amused at what holds us in check,"40 but rogue comedy—I shall argue— achieves its effects by exceeding the "finitude" of human powers. When the incorrigible Jim Dixon walks off with the girl at the end of Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim, his escape from limitations is exhilarat ingly complete, offering a vision of Effrontery Untrammeled and Un bowed. If comedy is to be approached with descriptive precision and not merely prescriptive, or proscriptive, force, we should confine our dis cussion to its indisputable determinants: its humor and the tendency of its hero to triumph. Even so we should realize that just one is suf ficient: sentimental comedy (such as Steele's The Conscious Lovers) can be completely devoid of humor, and dark comedy, though full of it, can be careless of its principals (recall Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from Stoppard's play); yet both kinds of representation are respect able claimants. But a work can't lack humor and a rewarded hero and still be called a comedy. As Lucky Jim illustrates, that hero and his girl may stand alone at the conclusion, especially in modern exam ples of the genre, many of which seem to show an affinity with the romantic polarizations of melodrama. (And even Shakespeare does not share Frye's anxiety about the inclusiveness of the denouement: not only is Shylock self-exiled, as Frye points out, from the final fes tivities of the Merchant, but so is dour Jacques of As You Like It; and the pathetic Malvolio of Twelfth Night exits famously swearing a revenge.) And, just as it is difficult to find a single tendency in the dramati zation of the hero's triumph (the title-character of the film Charlie Bubbles escapes what Dante would call the "harshness" of his affairs in a magically providential hot-air balloon), so, too, is it impossible to</page><page sequence="18">Robert Storey defend, for "laughing" comedy, every instance of humor as themati cally apt. Frye finds such aptness in comic disguise, calling it prepa ration for "a movement from illusion to reality" (169), but tragedy is equally obsessed with such movement and disguise is rarely a re course of its characters. Clearly, among the conventional comic con fusions—mistaken identity, misunderstandings of all sorts, messages and letters and tokens that go astray, farcical maneuverings in ill lighted quarters, encounters with animals, sight gags and sound riffs —disguise is important primarily for its incongruity, specifically for a type of incongruity that (unlike the serious dissembling of a villain— say, Edmund's in King Lear) seems harmless and so subject to the mastery of laughter by an audience that is cued to its playfulness. Of course the inventive writer will graft these incongruities to character and/or to theme, but comedy can be successful—at least efficiently amusing—in bald-faced defiance of both: a late episode of Cheers saw Carla dropped repeatedly down the well of a pantry dumbwaiter, a piece of business essentially unconnected to character (Rebecca would have been a more likely victim) and mute with respect to the matic development, but a funny bit nevertheless. The scene as a whole suggests how important is cuing to the audi ence's reception of comedy. Cuing may be thought of as an extension of what psychologists call "set": in comedy we're not only set for humor, but cued in various semiotic ways to regard the (perceived or imagined) spectacle now as playfully, whimsically fictive, now as se riously engaging and "real." In a fictive spectacle, no harm is pos sible, and so, although Carla is apparently dropped from a height that would cripple a human being, her stylized shriek and the con text of mayhem—general, improbable, but infectious—assure us that a character, not a person, has been victimized. But she's a much be loved character, and so she must survive—unlike the minister who dies quietly in the episode and whose body is bundled from place to place in an effort to conceal his demise. It was, doubtless, scenes like these that led Bergson to conclude that "the comic demands some thing like a momentary anesthesia of the heart."41 But I think we can refine that judgment: first, it is laughter, not "the comic," that is a sign of constrained feeling, although we needn't agree that, in Bergson's words, an "absence of feeling . . . usually accompanies laughter."42 Laughter is an expression of the pleasure of mastery, of what Hobbes called, rightly, "a sudden glory arising from some sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves,"43 although that eminency is not neces sarily a social one. "The comic," on the other hand—comedy, more</page><page sequence="19">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 425 generally—may admit of other feelings, and, even in the presence of comic "types," we may experience a considerable range of emotions as we oscillate between identification with or empathy for a character and detachment encouraged by a sense of our "eminency." The min ister of Cheers had no time for ingratiation, given the perfunctoriness of his on-camera life; his death, therefore, seems of little consequence, permitting the incongruities of his mortification—so affectively un real—to delight.44 Here we have a case of visual incongruity, of a corpse inconven iently encumbering the pantry, an incongruity "mastered" by the implicit concession that an encumbrance is an encumbrance, dead body or what-have-you, and that it must be shifted like any other eyesore if the party is to be a success. (But, as Forabosco notes, this is "congruous incongruity": the encumbrance remains stubbornly a corpse.) When we turn from situation to character in comedy, we remain within the paradigm sketched out above, but we can intro duce a greater orderliness into our discussion by classifying comic characters according to type. Frye's is the best-known of these classi fications, but his categories seem to me both eccentric and confused. His enthusiasm for Aristotle sends him to the Ethics, as well as to the anonymous Tractatus Coislinianus (sometimes argued to be a sum mary of Poetics 11), and from these he derives four types that fall, sus piciously, into the symmetry of "two opposed pairs": the alazon (impostor) and the eiron (self-deprecator) oppose the bomolochos (buf foon) and the agroikos (churl) (172). The "self-deprecator" he asso ciates with the hero of comedy, since "the dramatist tends to play him down and make him rather neutral and unformed in character" (173)—although how this diminution relates to self-deprecation is not immediately clear. Nor is it clear why the go-betweens of comedy— the sharp slaves of Plautus and Terence, for example—should be classed as self-deprecators as well. When we turn to Frye's buffoons and churls, we find that both of them can be described as fools: then we read, puzzlingly, that "often . . . the churl belongs to the alazon group," since in comedy "all miserly old men" are churls (176). Final ly, a fifth type is smuggled into the argument, "a character we may call the plain dealer, an outspoken advocate of a kind of moral norm who has the sympathy of the audience" (176). These categorical confusions can be avoided, I think, if we restrict the types to just those characters that elicit laughter (or the smile), conceding that others, like the mouthpiece or author's "advocate," are not exclusively comic types. So restricted, the types reduce to a</page><page sequence="20">Robert Storey simple four (and no Greek names are necessary): the fool, the wit, the rogue, and—in the case of romantic comedy—the hero.45 But it may be best to regard them, not as types, but as centers of gravity to which characters are drawn and around which, temporarily or per manently, they coalesce, often in motley states of hybridization. It's rare to find pure examples of the four: the fool, for example, is often witty (or "wise"), the rogue is sometimes identical with the hero; a character may begin as a rogue but be proven a fool, like Volpone or Tartuffe. And it's possible—even usual in the modern sitcom—for a character to drift in and out of "type": Falstaff (in the hands of an in telligent actor) is not solely defined by his comic persona(e). For the sake of clarity, however, I'll discuss each type as a behavioral poten tiality with both purity and persistence. I should emphasize that I'm dealing with conceptual categories, not literary figures (Lear's Fool, for example) in which hybridization has already taken place (like Er asmus's Folly, Lear's Fool is wise). If this is kept in mind, I might be forgiven some of the simplifications involved in sharpening and de limiting the categories. The fool is perhaps the most important of the types, since his (or her) blunders often serve to clarify the norms of the comic spectacle. Usually it's the fool who actively "blocks" those norms, as Orgon blocks both the lovers' union and the concomitant restoration of com mon sense throughout the first four acts of Tartuffe. Frye suggests that the absurdity of such a character results from "what Pope calls a ruling passion" and that his or her function "is to express a state of what might be called ritual bondage" (168). All fools, like Orgon, are addled by obsession, and the movement of the play is toward deliv ery from their bondage, towards "a kind of moral norm, or pragmati cally free society" (169). But the example of Orgon should give us pause. He's obsessed, it is true, but his obsession is a symptom, not the cause, of his absurdity. When his eyes are finally opened to Tar tuffe's hypocrisy, his reaction is not to throw off his shackles, but to chain himself blindly to another illusion: "Enough, by God!" he cries to Cleante (here in Wilbur's elegant translation), "I'm through with pious men:/Henceforth I'll hate the whole false brotherhood,/And persecute them worse than Satan could."46 Because he seems such a vital creature, modern readers have been eager to account for his weaknesses in psychologically determinate ways: he's a repressed (and so fantasmatically enfevered) homosexual; he's a "narcissist" fleeing "ontological insecurity";47 he's a tyrant who is punishing his family "for possessing what he feels himself to be losing: youth, gaie</page><page sequence="21">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 427 ty, strong natural desires."48 All of this may be true, but the most plausible explanation is that he is a fool, and that fools are incorrigi bly stupid. Such are the blocking figures in Roman comedy, usually characters as free of a "ruling passion" as they are of intelligence. How is it, for example, that old Theopropides, the senex in Plautus's Mostellaria, is so easily duped by Tranio, his slave, into believing that his house is haunted? The answer: Theopropides is a fool and fools can be ex pected to be credulous. He suffers fundamentally from what Bergson calls a "callousness to social life"-. "Any individual is comic," Bergson suggests, "who automatically goes his own way without troubling himself about getting into touch with the rest of his fellow-beings."49 When he is put in touch with them, as Theopropides is, he is unable to "read" them with precision or skill. Such a character is deficient in what Michael Carrithers calls "narrativity," the competence to inter pret and to judge social situations correctly.50 As the villain of melo drama is narrativically deviant, indifferent to the social rights of the victim, so the fool of comedy is often narrativically incompetent, un able to detect the strategems by which he or she is duped by the rogue. The fool lacks mastery—a mastery measured not only by its defense against roguery but also by the norms of the fictive world with which his or her behavior is incongruent. Which is to say that foolish ness unattributable to mere narrative incompetence is always a rela tive affair, and that what is foolish in one play or novel (by the reckoning of its norms) may be genuinely admirable behavior in an other. It's not difficult to find in many comedies, for example, vari ous boobies who are the fools of books, but in Aldous Huxley's wicked Antic Hay, we encounter in Casimir Lypiatt a stupidity de rived from an ignorance of T. S. Eliot ("Look down on Mexico, Con quistador," runs a typical line of his fervid doggerel: "Land of your golden dream").51 Any set of norms is in fact possible in comedy, and any fool may be found to violate them, since stupidity, the fool's de fining malady, may be chalked up to any cause. Over-sophistication or under-sophistication, lack of constraint or too much control, con tempt for the average or its divinization: all are possible targets in comedy, and a fool may be imagined for each of them. The foolishness can take various forms, of course. Lypiatt's is ver bal, part of a lively history of linguistic incompetence, from the turgidity of Aeschylus in Aristophanes' Frogs, to the baffled entan glements of a lost Lou Costello as he stumbles through "Who's on</page><page sequence="22">428 Robert Storey First." The issue is mastery, or the fool's lack of it, and so any as pect of the fool's experience is subject to his or her omnivorous bun gling—the physical, the verbal, the social, the imaginative. (As an example of the latter, there is Kirby Groomkirby from N. F. Simp son's play One Way Pendulum, who conceives the project of teaching speak-your-weight scales to sing the "Hallelujah Chorus." Once in structed, they'll all be transported to the North Pole, where a crowd will gather to hear them. The listeners will be asked to jump on cue; the impact will tilt the earth on its axis; the ensuing Ice Age will cause thousands of deaths, and bring out mourning attire—gratify ingly for Kirby, since he is fascinated by black clothing.) The plea sure of the spectator lies in perceiving the bungling both as possible and as incongruous: possible because the fool is "out of touch" (even Aeschylus occasionally nods), incongruous because the specta tor is narrativically savvy, or sympathetic—for the nonce—with the norms. It's from, then, a certain spectatorial remove that the fool's calamities are entertained, a detachment bespeaking the viewer's own eminency as much as his or her sense of the harmlessness of the scene. Not so, I think, with the wit. Part of the pleasure in beholding a wit work is in imagining the mastery of the character as one's own. For, while the fool incarnates all manner of incompetence, the wit en joys total control. Like the fool's, his or her world is interactively var ious, and various are the wits that control it. The physical wit is an acrobat or juggler—a Chaplin, for example, who's a Brummell of his bowler or suave balletic genius of his cane. (Usually, however, this wit is a hybrid, a fool that is a wit by inadvertence: Harold Lloyd of course always comes to mind, dangling spiderishly from his clock face and mastering the precariousness malgre lui.) As for the wits of the verbal there are no purer examples than the characters of The Im portance of Being Earnest; in them wit acquires a kind of bizarre self sufficiency, unalloyed by the vulgarity of psychological motive ("You see, [my diary] is simply a very young girl's record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently meant for publica tion").52 Less exaltedly, we can repair to the sitcom, where the fools seem, unfortunately, to be getting rarer and the rogues have all but disappeared (Dabney Coleman's much-missed "Buffalo Bill" crowned the type with short-lived glory), but the wits survive enfee bled though undaunted. Murphy Brown doesn't have the style of Lady Bracknell, but she has the wit's characteristically assured savoir faire. Somewhat less common are wits of the imagination, although</page><page sequence="23">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective Stoppard, at least in his early work, seems fascinated with the type: in Jumpers it makes an appearance as Archie, whose philosophy is that "No problem is insoluble given a big enough plastic bag." Dan dy, magician, acrobat, Archie is close kin to those shadowy wits with whom the artist is often romantically allied—to Shakespeare's Pros pero, to Nietzsche's rope-dancer, to the confidence men of Melville and Mann.53 But in these figures the humor (if it is present) is greatly attenuated, a legacy of the artist's ambivalence about art, and about the humanity that aspires to its crafty perfection. The social wit enjoys its most vital life in classical and Renaissance comedy: there it's enfigured as the go-between, the willing servant, the wily slave, the Celestina of Spain's early Golden Age drama, the architectus of Plautine intrigue. As the so-called "first" zanni of com media dell'arte, it tends to control the entire comic action, keeping the lovers on tenterhooks, duping fools, foiling rogues, then making all come out right in the end. Of all the comic types the social wit seems the most fantastical, since its motives are often obscure, even per verse. Of course the slave of Roman comedy and the Spanish gracioso are both driven by fear and a concern for their livelihood, but later incarnations, like the Dorine of Tartuffe, seem to abet the lovers' inter est in defiance of their own. That they're born as the fulfillment of a (usually male) wish is suggested by the magical milieu of Puck and Ariel, "the two clearest examples of the type in Shakespeare" (Frye, 174), and in keeping with their general fantasticality, they are usually of uncertain or indeterminate origin, having neither discoverable par entage nor kin. As literature becomes more realistic—and its social context more egalitarian—this type is endangered, reduced to the clever Jeeves of Wodehouse's stories, or to the spunky maid, like Shirley Booth's Hazel. But we have a need for the type, and so we find for it contexts other than those that traditionally obtain between master and servant or slave: Eddie Murphy's inventions in Beverly Hills Cop are some of the most brilliant of its later avatars, even though Justice is the only master it serves. In most of these characters there's an admixture of the rogue, and it may be tempting to class the latter as simply a subtype of the wit. But I think that the rogue deserves a class of its own, not only be cause rogues are not always witty (Tom Arnold's roguery in "The Jackie Thomas Show" smacked more of the fool than the wit) but also because the rogue, as I shall argue, rouses in the spectator a more complex response than detachment or identification. The defin ing characteristic of the rogue is gross selfishness: unlike the social</page><page sequence="24">430 Robert Storey wit, which survives in serving others, however incidentally, merce narily, or reluctantly, the rogue works for him- or herself alone; the rogue's name—"Volpone," "Sergeant Bilko," "Lex Luthor"—often suggests contest or predation. If the social wit sometimes seems a fantastical creature, the rogue seems an unnervingly possible one. For it satisfies, not the hunger of easy access to the girl, of social har mony or the triumph of justice, but the more modest thirst for exploi tation. The rogue is, in the terminology of the evolutionist, a "cheat" at the banquet of life. (In Roman comedy, the banquet is often literal, and the rogue who sits down to it a "parasite.") If he or she can get something for nothing—or for the small effort that it takes to be adopted by a rich man, or to pretend a deathbed agony and bilk the would-be heirs—then neither the intelligent nor the foolish is im mune from victimization. The rogue can be utterly ruthless in swin dling others—and yet still retain the appeal of a comic type. How it can do so is partly explained by the playfulness of comedy as a whole. The rogue's aggressiveness is moc/c-aggressiveness, a fact that is signaled by the cues of a text or, in the case of performance, of an actor. The incongruity of his or her criminality is resolved, there fore, by its apprehension as a game. But the appeal of the figure runs deeper, I think, than its power to evoke incongruity: the rogue holds out a certain attraction to the spectator, as one who can turn the so cial scene to his or her wanton advantage. Having silenced that voice that tells us "how far we can go without incurring intolerable risks" —I quote Richard Alexander's definition of conscience54—the rogue slips by both shame and guilt to savor the fruits of audacity. When those fruits are stolen from the mouths of fools, there is little scruple in our laughter, since the fool's misfortunes, as I earlier suggested, are viewed from a superior vantage. When the intelligent and the upright are fleeced, however, our identifying with the rogue becomes more problematic—for here, if we laugh, we do so at the expense of those who seem undeserving of exploitation. But, if not laughter, cer tainly a smile of complicity is permissible in the presence of even the most merciless of rogues; in fact, that display seems required of the spectator of comedy, maybe because the smile is an automatic signal of appeasement that defends us from the suspicion of criminal conta gion. Usually, our response is ambiguously mixed, our laughter ex pressing sympathetic identification, our smiles unconscious expiatory reassurance, both of which confusedly converge in "mirth." What is most significant about all three of these types—the fool, the wit, the rogue—is that they invite a response that confirms in the</page><page sequence="25">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 431 spectator a sense of his or her behavioral eminency. In laughing at the fool, or with the wit, or (ambivalently) in complicity with the rogue's transgressions, we enjoy in comedy a release from the neces sity of negotiating social compromise. Comedy may explicitly valor ize that compromise, especially when it ends in promiscuous festivity, but implicitly the laughter of its audience serves the interests of the masterful individual alone. Such a conclusion accords with the empirical findings on the effects of laughter on the physiology and psychology of the organism: laughter, it's been learned over the last several years, can strengthen both the stress- and disease-fighting immune system;55 it can alleviate pain and reduce psychological ten sion;56 it can increase creativity and flexibility of thought.57 All these reflect phenotypic advantages, and comedy may differ essentially from tragedy in licensing the drive towards self-serving fitness by the laughter of its spectators.58 Whereas tragedy moves its hero toward isolation while implicitly valorizing the affiliative behaviors, comedy moves the hero toward union while implicitly valorizing the mastery of its beholders. Also, tragedy encourages empathic understanding of a kind that is foreign to "laughing" comedy: laughter is the sign of an incongruity mastered by a previously assimilated schema; as such, nothing is "new" to it, so to speak, and, unlike the pleasures of the tragic katharsis, the emotion that it engages is, however delightful, always one and the same. It is inimical, consequently, to the zvork of empathy, which not only deepens one's self-understanding but ex tends and enriches one's affiliative range.59 Apparently all of the types had their ancient origin in a figure whose behavior seems to confirm these conclusions, the so-called Trickster of oral narrative. Known by many names and under many forms, anthropomorphic as well as theriomorphic, the Trickster ap pears in both Eastern and Western cultures as a creature in which "seemingly contradictory roles are combined in a single personality" (Apte, 214). Like the fool, he has little control over either his physical self or the world: the hands, for example, of a Winnebago Trickster get into a quarrel with themselves, the right slashing the left with a knife; "in another story he instructs his anus to keep watch over the roasted ducks while he sleeps, and when he finds out that they have been eaten by foxes, he tries to punish the offender by sitting on the fire but cannot endure the pain"; in still another, "he eats a bulb de spite a warning that it will lead to defecation and almost drowns in the mountain of his own excrement" (Apte, 215). But the Trickster is also a cunning rogue, and his insatiable appetite for food and sex</page><page sequence="26">Robert Storey hotly stimulates his invention. As Krishna (the hero of the Mahabhar ata and the narrator of the Bhagavad-Gita), he toys with the breasts of nubile young milkmaids on the pretext of recovering a stray ball, or he hides their clothes as they bathe in the river, agreeing to return them only if the owners emerge to claim them in the nude. The Zande Trickster, Ture (or "spider"), kills his father in his quest for a magic formula and seduces his mother-in-law. (But even armed with the formula he goes without food, and his penis confesses his incest.) Like the type that I call the social wit, the Trickster is also a benefi cial agent: Ture brings food and fire to the earth; Krishna slays de mons in protection of his people, and the Oceanic Trickster, Maui-of a-Thousand-Tricks, gives land and sun and vegetation to humanity. But apparently so inadvertent is so much of his benevolence that some anthropologists have demurred at the suggestion that the Trickster is a "cultural hero." "Tricksters," writes anthropologist Ma hadev L. Apte, whose account I have followed above, "are not cul ture heroes in the sense in which the term is commonly used. They are not noble, generous, caring, far-sighted, or altruistic. They cer tainly lack both a broad vision of the ultimate good of human soci eties and a motivation to act for it. As Boas . . . rightly noted, the fact that the tricksters' acts benefited humans is simply accidental, an un intentional by-product of the quest for self-gratification or trouble" (232). Tricksters, in short, lack a sense of empathy, and they do so, I think, because they are conceived to excite laughter alone. When em pathy inflects the social wit's behavior—when the Pedrolino of classi cal commedia dell'arte ceases to separate Isabella and Flavio, or to tease Franceschina, or to dupe the Dottore, regarding them no longer as objects of fun but as unfortunates deserving of fair-dealing—the laughter of the comedy evaporates. We are converging upon our pre viously implied point: that laughter and the movement towards affil iation in comedy are elements—to quote Nelson—"in conflict."60 It's not only the type, then, but also all humor in general that, for Nelson, opposes the closure of comedy: "In As You Like It, and in many other comedies, there is a tension between the forward move ment of the plot, which is usually towards marriage, and the back ward pull of the dialogue, which ridicules it."61 Doubtless he is thinking of a scene like the following, in which the love-sick Orlando is teased by Rosalind, disguised as a boy but posing as herself, and incensed at her lover's tardiness: Ros.... I had as lief be woo'd of a snail.</page><page sequence="27">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 433 On. Of a snail! Ros. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him. Orl. What's that? Ros.Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents the slander of his wife. (4.1.46-55) Although Orlando protests that "my Rosalind is virtuous," every lov er's nightmare has been rehearsed here in play. The teasing badinage of As You Like It presents marriage as a surreptitious contest of wills, a struggle, as it were, for phenotypic fitness, in which victory is mea sured in potential reproductive success. If the wife does not crown her husband with horns, she keeps him clapped in a (somewhat noisy) domestic zoo: "I will be more jealous of thee," quips Rosalind to Orlando, "than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamor ous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey" (4.1.133-35). This view of mar riage, as a check to independence and a field of warring interests, threads clearly through comedy from Aristophanes to Shaw, whose John Tanner expresses it with trenchant vigor: "Marriage is to me apostasy, profanation of the sanctuary of my soul, violation of my manhood, sale of my birthright, shameful surrender, ignominious capitulation, acceptance of defeat."62 And marriage is, of course, not the only self-abrogation. "The comic attitude to children and child birth has always," writes Nelson, "been ambivalent": Babies in comedy are left on mountainsides, in baskets, on doorsteps, or even in the left-luggage compartments of rail way stations; but the assumption, in all but the darkest works, is that they will turn up again when they are old enough to be interesting. Aristophanes, in The Frogs, chides Euripides for dwelling too much on domestic things in his tragedies, but the rule against cooing over children applies just as strongly to comedy: children restrict freedom, and freedom is one of the defining characteristics of the comic hero and heroine.63 And yet the hero and heroine of romantic comedy stand as protests to that last remark. Their defining characteristic (as Tanner's case il lustrates) is their willingness to give up their freedom—precisely that willingness that Nelson has argued is "in conflict" with the values of</page><page sequence="28">434 Robert Storey laughter. But the word "conflict," I think, is a misleading one, at least if the argument of comedy is grasped in full adaptationist terms. The "tension" of comedy that Nelson describes is an expression of the paradox of the sexual animal: intent on maximizing its inclusive fit ness but inevitably compromising its "own" interests in the pursuit. Whereas laughter licenses the latter interests, the affiliative senti ments ensure that they widen to embrace an "inclusive" success. To be brief: romantic comedy serves ultimately the gene, not the pheno type that laughter preserves. As Shaw says (in diluting Schopenhauer with Bergson), it's the "Life Force" that finally "enchants." It does so through the seductiveness of the smile, our response to the success and marriage of the hero, a response that legitimates our earlier having classed him with the rest of the comic types. Unless that hero is a hybridized creature, quasi-fool, -wit, or -rogue, he is not a character to excite our laughter; he is, rather, the figure of Frye's cool adjectives—"rather neutral and unformed." In the comic denouement, he acquires not so much definition as a kind of affective weight: he gains in substance as we smile in sympathy, especially at the spectacle of his union. The union need not be (although it usually is) marital: at the end of the Menaechmi it joins brother with brother; at the end of The Winter's Tale, husband with wife. What is essential is that the bitterest enemies exit as friends and that nobody kills any one else. For in affiliations such as these, comedy offers the "understanding" of which it is most capable, even if inarticulately so. It doesn't deepen and refine the social emotions, as the pathos of trag edy tends to do; it rouses a pleasurably self-ratifying intuition: the sense, in Frye's words, that "this should be." Baudelaire called it "joy," and associated it with the smile; whereas the laugh was "satanic," a sign of "fallen humanity," the smile was "analogous to the wagging of a dog's tail, or to the purring of a cat."64 His intui tions seem right, at least about the smile, for, like those "purely ani mal expressions of contentment,"65 it signals a willingness to bond and the pleasure of doing so—and, in sharing it with the hero of comedy, the spectator expresses both understanding and respect for the feeling that has ensured his union. That the smile should be perceived as justifiably routing laughter is a measure of the hegemony of the gene. Nelson quotes a character in Goethe's Elective Affinities who is musing on the meretriciousness of the comic denouement: "In a comedy we see a marriage as the fi nal fulfillment of a desire which has been thwarted by the obstacles of several acts. The moment the desire is fulfilled the curtain falls,</page><page sequence="29">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 435 and this momentary satisfaction goes on echoing in our minds. ... In the real world the play continues after the curtain has fallen, and when it is raised again there is not so much pleasure to be gained by seeing or hearing what is going on."66 Too cynical by half, of course. But, more importantly, irrelevant as a critique of romantic comedy. The very function of the latter is to confer that "momentary satisfac tion"; its denouement may be likened to the katharsis of tragedy, which illuminates the destructiveness of the asocial will. Both genres, for all their formal dissimilarities, tend to encourage those behaviors that conscript the individual into the productive self-diminishments of cooperation and conjugation. Neither is completely unambivalent about the enterprise: Medea in her chariot may be facing, as she knows, a future of unrelieved remorse, but her revenge has neverthe less been exhilarating; and the Ubu Rois of comedy will never con sent to self-control, much to the delight of those spectatorial rebels brandishing imaginary pschittaswords. But, in the main, Love is Best because It's an expedient ethic: it ensures the delivery of the selfish gene from one short-lived gamete-bearer to another. The attendants of that delivery may be splendidly various, as a consideration of these two literary modes suggests. In the long run, however, there is only one human story, and it is inscribed and reinscribed by the mor tal coils for the sake of the mute—and quite inglorious—immortal ones. Especially for the Western mind, the dissimilarities may seem par amount. Our usual tendency is to regard tragedy and comedy, not as performing similar adaptive functions, but as offering more or less veridical (and opposed) generic "visions" of human life. By "more or less" I mean that one seems "more," and the other "less." For rarely is a literary critic able to resist the temptation to take sides in their ostensible debate. After describing or defining one of the genres in coarsely or subtly unflattering terms, the critic then holds up the other as the more incisive, more comprehensive, or simply more true. Here, for example, is Joseph W. Meeker, who begins, interestingly enough, with a position like my own, but who then goes on to depart radically from it, mainly by ignoring the spectator: As patterns of behavior, both tragedy and comedy are strate gies for the resolution of conflicts. From the tragic perspec tive, the world is a battleground where good and evil, man and nature, truth and falsehood make war, each with the goal of destroying its polar opposite. Warfare is the basic metaphor of tragedy, and its strategy is a battle plan de</page><page sequence="30">436 Robert Storey signed to eliminate the enemy. That is why tragedy ends with a funeral or its equivalent. Comic strategy, on the other hand, sees life as a game. Its basic metaphors are sporting events and the courtship of lovers, and its conclusion is gen erally a wedding rather than a funeral. When faced with po lar opposites, the problem of comedy is always how to resolve conflict without destroying the participants. Comedy is the art of accommodation and reconciliation.67 This is a crude example, but it's typical enough, because it's grounded in an assumption that is inseparable from critical practice, at least since the demise of structuralism: that literature is usually about human behavior, either as it is or as it ideally should be, and that one work of literature (or of philosophy or "theory") is prefer able to another because it is persuasively faithful to that behavior. For Meeker, accommodation is ideally preferable to warfare, and, be cause comedy and not tragedy seems to enjoin accommodation, com edy is preferable to tragedy. Even the most sophisticated of critics is drawn into this side-taking. The poststructuralist Michelle Gellrich, for example, in deploring Aristotle's "distinct bias against a conflic tual understanding of character and action," implies that, not only is tragedy always conflictual, but the human being itself is to be under stood as a thing of rifts and aporias, the incarnate logomachy of post modernist myth.68 The fundamental question is still, What is Man? and the conviction that still drives the study of literature is that somewhere in the multiplicities of the literary dynamics lies an an swer to that question. But literature will always do the human being, like the police, in different voices, and to look to it for a veridical model of humanity is to engage in a futile project. That model can only be derived—and literature consequently understood—through the anterior construc tions of "theory." Which theory? is, of course, the crucial question. My own answer should be clear enough. "Had we known no other life-form than our own," the British philosopher Mary Midgley ob serves, "we should have been utterly mysterious to ourselves as a species."69 Her verbs suggest that there was a point of divide at which the mysteriousness began to dissipate, and that point was ob viously the date of publication of The Origin of Species. Its author clearly understood the implications of his work for the future of phil osophical thought: "Origin of man," he confided to his "M" note book, "now proved. ... He who understands baboon would do more towards metaphysics than Locke."70 Primatologists have already en</page><page sequence="31">Comedy: The Evolutionary Perspective 437 tered upon the immensely exciting project of revising those meta physics. And not only primatologists: anthropologists, psychologists, behavioral biologists, neuroscientists, philosophers of mind—re searchers in dozens of disciplines, now working within the evolution ary paradigm, are beginning to define human nature in a persuasively definitive way. It seems time for the literary theorist to profit from—and, if possible, enrich—the enterprise. Temple University Notes 1.

To give Sutton his due, I should note that he concedes, in passing (and in a parenthesis), that ridiculousness "perhaps" involves "some form of per ceived incongruity" (42); but his casualness and indifference to precision— humor, as I shall argue, involves a masterable incongruity—do not strengthen his position. 23.

Sometimes the incongruity may arise simply through the operation of telling a joke: the framing of discourse as a joke to be "got" conveys to the audience that mastery should follow. And so, although a pun (for example) may be grasped through the mental superimposition of two equally con gruent schemata (and not through the "resolution" of an incongruity by a congruence), its comprehension depends upon the listener's sensitivity to the "discrepancy" of which it marks a linguistic departure. In other words, the pun must be understood as an incongruent disruption of "ordinary" commu nicative language. 33.

Doubtless it was the affective unreality of the misshapen and the ugly that once licensed public laughter at their expense (see John J. O'Connor, "Physical Deformity and Chivalric Laughter in Renaissance England," in Comedy: New Perspectives, ed. Maurice Charney [New York: New York Liter ary Forum, 1978], 50-62). The sense of (masterable) incongruity was the cause of that laughter, but the latter could be given open expression because its targets were not being regarded as human—that is, there was no attempt at empathic identification with the objects of the laughter. Such barbarity is, of course, still with us. The videotape of the assault on Reginald Denny, the trucker who was pulled from his cab and beaten after the recent L.A. riot, shows one of the thugs laughing, his arms raised in triumph, after smashing</page><page sequence="34">440 Robert Storey Denny's head with a brick. The attacker is clearly oblivious to Denny's pain: Denny is simply a target, and, when the brick meets the target after a chancy throw, the reaction of the attacker is exultation, mainly over his own ballistic mastery. 45. In keeping with my view of romantic comedy as (generally) male wish-fulfillment, the word "hero" when it is used in this article will mean a male hero. If, in fact, all the comic types originated in the Trickster figure (see below, pp. 431-32), my restriction of the hero's sex seems additionally justified, since Tricksters "are basically considered to be males" (Mahadev L.

By "self" (in "self-serving") I mean the "atomic" self, not the extended self that, say, Antigone serves. Tragedy often focuses upon a hero who feels keenly an obligation to kin or group; the laughter of comedy, I am suggest ing, ministers to the "selfish" phenotype. 59. As humor theorists have pointed out, "laughter can reveal group alle giances, communicate attitudes, and help in establishing, and reaffirming dominance in a status hierarchy. . . . Additionally, . . . some of humor's ma jor functions have to do with aiding members of small groups to engage in smooth interactions" (Antony J. Chapman, "Humor and Laughter in Social Interaction and Some Implications for Humor Research," in Handbook of Hu mor Research, 135). But these regulatory functions should not be confused with those that invite or affectively deepen affiliation—the province, as I shall emphasize below, not of the laugh but of the smile. 60.
