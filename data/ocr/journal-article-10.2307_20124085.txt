<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARISTOTLE, DISPOSITIONS AND OCCULT POWERS PETER T. MAN I CAS J. am concerned in this paper to clarify what I think is a common misconception about what might be called "Aristotelian science." At the same time I hope to say something about scientific explana tion and to support recent claims that "procrustean" empiricism, such as that defended by some "disposition" theorists, simply is not adequate.1 The doctrine which needs clarification may be put several ways: "Modern" science, unlike Aristotelian science, does not appeal to "occult powers"; or, the doctrine of final causes is occult and unscientific; or, while modern science, in establishing laws, "explains," Aristotelian science does not. More narrowly, two separate though related claims are being made: (1) Aristotelian science is occult (animistic or metaphysical). This charge is leveled at final causes and Aristotelian "powers." (2) Aristotelian science does not explain. This charge is typified by Moli?re's famous jibe at "dormitive power." In order to clear away the truths from the half-truths, I will defend the following points: (1) Aristotle's science is not occult in any important sense, but (2) Aristotle's conceptual framework did lend itself to misconstruc tion and misinterpretation. (3) The kind of misinterpretation to which it lends itself, and the reasons why it does, sheds some light on "explanation." (4) If a disposition sentence is to be construed as an abbreviation for a set of counterfactuals, then an explanation which appeals to a 1 My paradigm is Ryle's Concept of Mind (New York, 1949); the reprinted in English translation in Logical Positivism, ed. by A.

Scriven, "Definitions, Explanations, and Theories," in Minnesota Studies, Vol. II, esp. Section 32.</page><page sequence="2">ARISTOTLE, DISPOSITIONS AND OCCULT POWERS 679 disposition is limited in much the same ways as an Aristotelian explanation in terms of "powers" and "ends." 1. We must first distinguish "Aristotle's science," from what has come to be called "Aristotelian science." It has been con vincingly argued that the history book thesis which holds that the Middle Ages was the age of Aristotle and that the Renaissance was the age of Plato cannot be maintained without considerable qualification.2 The qualification is double barrelled in that the influences of both Plato and Aristotle were felt to greater or lesser extents by writers of widely diverging sympathies in both historical periods. If we couple this with the recognition that Christian, Arabic and Byzantine influences merged, along with some others, it should be obvious that the handy label, "Aristotelian," must be used with considerable caution, if used at all. I shall be con cerned, therefore, to talk mainly about Aristotle's science and to suggest a plausible hypothesis for the misconstructions of later writers, whether they were avowed Aristotelians or not. Secondly, I want to distinguish Aristotle's conceptual apparatus for dealing with many scientific problems?in particular kinesis and metabole?from his actual scientific researches, for example, in physics (in our sense of the word), biology, etc. Moreover, I want to separate this apparatus from his cosmology or theology.8 In other words, I am looking at Aristotle from the point of view of philosophy of science, not from the point of view of the history and development of scientific truth, or from the point of view of a cosmologist. I therefore am not going to argue that (say) Aristotle's physics was fundamentally sound, or that his cosmology (the unmoved mover, the orbs, etc.,) is defensible.* 2. The five or six concepts which cause the most trouble in interpreting Aristotle's science are "power" (dynamis) and its a See Paul Oskar Kristeller, Renaissance Thought (New York, 1961). * I shall not argue whether we call this conceptual apparatus meta physical or meta-scientific. 4 Indeed, it is interesting to note that his physics is bad because he settled for untested commonsense, his cosmology is bad because it is a priori speculation (although it explains), and that his central conceptual apparatus for dealing with observable change and motion is inadequate, though not occult, because it is too empirical.</page><page sequence="3">680 PETER T. MAN ICAS correlative, "operation" or "actuality" (energeia), "complete realization" (entelecheia), "form" (eidos), "end" (telos), and finally, "nature" (physis). An exhaustive analysis of these central concepts would be far beyond the scope of a single paper; but such an analysis is also unnecessary. Several important and recent books simplify this task.5 But to arrive most directly at the central theses of my paper, I shall argue that these central concepts may be satisfactorily construed in the contemporary language of dis positions. 3. To say that salt is soluble is at least to say that if it were put in water, then in certain circumstances, it would dissolve. To say that wood is combustible is at least to say that if it were heated to kindling temperature, then, in certain circumstances it would burn.6 In general, then, even a minimal analysis requires recog nizing that disposition predicates apply to certain "thing-kinds" (salt, wood, etc.), that something 'phi' must be done, that certain circumstances, 'C are present, and that something else, 'psi' results. For while salt dissolves in water, wood does not; that before wood burns, it must be ignited; that if oxygen is not present, wood will not burn; and that heating wood causes it to burn, not to dissolve. More generally, then, Phi-ing K in cir cumstances C causes K to Psi. My point is then, that Aristotle's analysis recognizes each of these constituent elements in any change, but that his analysis, while it emphasizes the commonsense elements and is not occult, falls short on two other counts. Thus though Aristotle emphasized the role of the "thing-kind,"7 he failed to point up the role of Phi-ing and, as well, only suggested the reasons why certain K's do in fact Psi when they are Phi-ed. This latter limitation he shares with some modern empiricisms. In Aristotle's language, particular "natures" have particular 5 See John P. Anton, Aristotle's Theory of Contrariety (London, 1957); John H. Randall, Aristotle (New York, 1960); Friedrich Solmsen, Aristotle's System of the Physical World (Ithaca, I960). 6 The discussion owes much to Wilfred Sellars, "Counterfactuals, Dis positions, Causal Modalities," in Minnesota Studies, Vol. II. I say "at least" in this paragraph so as not to prejudge an important point bearing on the interpretation of disposition predicates. 7 See Anton's discussion of "distributive being," op. cit.</page><page sequence="4">ARISTOTLE, DISPOSITIONS AND OCCULT POWERS 681 "powers," which when "energized," "external hindrances re moved," come to their "realization." The "actualization" of a thing's "end" is identical with its "form." 4. It can be shown that an Aristotelian "power" is not occult in the animistic sense that it postulates or appeals to an "inner urge," or "end-in-view." Indeed, though the word "power" is mysterious, there is no hokus-pokus involved.8 In several places, Aristotle seeks to clarify what he means by dynamis.9 The primary meaning, it seems clear, is that of "an originative source of change." But there are two "aspects" to such change. Thus a thing may have potency in the sense of acting or in the sense of being acted upon.10 Crucially, for Aris totle, both aspects are involved in every change. To take one of his examples: "that which is oily can be burned" (Meta., 1046a 25). The "passive" aspect, or "patient" is capable of being acted upon; it has a certain power, namely, it will burn. But this power is not manifested in the oily thing unless it is heated. Heat, then, in this example has the capacity of burning that which is oily; it is the "agent." Aristotle insists in several places that movement, change or alteration involves "power" both as active and passive. In the Physics, for example, while discussing motion, he says: "But the fact that a thing is altered requires that there should be something that alters it, something, e.g. that makes the potentially hot into the actually hot (260b 1-2).ll Aristotle's dynamis-energeia distinction is a product of anal ysis; it is an abstraction which enables us to analyze change, and, as such, it plays approximately the same role as does a disposition 8 De Wulf, Medieval Philosophy (Cambridge, 1922), remarks: "We should say that the sculptor has the 'power' to make a statue, but we should hardly say that the block of marble had the 'power' of becoming a statue" (p. 68 n.). Yet the block has dynamis. It is said that one can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. 9 In the Philosophical Lexicon, Meta., Delta, ch. 12; Physics, VIII, ch. 4; Meta., Theta, ch. 1. 10 "Obviously, then, in a sense the potency of acting and of being acted upon is one (for a thing may be 'capable' either because it can be acted on or because something else can be acted on by it), but in a sense the potencies are different" (Meta., 1046a). See also, Randall, op. cit., p. 91. 11 See also De Generatione et Corruptione, I, ch. 7.</page><page sequence="5">682 PETER T. MAN I CAS concept.11 A thing is combustible if it burns; it is so disposed. Here the ordinary man?following Aristotle's commonsense con ception?says that it is the "nature" of that kind of thing. As Randall puts it: As a specific nature, the nature of a stone to fall, the nature of a dog to bark, the nature of a man to seek knowledge, a 'nature' is a specific power of being moved or acted upon, set in operation or actualized by some external motion or agent, or some unmoved mover, and of then moving in a determinate way.1* Thus we cannot say of Aristotle that his teleology demands some occult and mysterious urge which willy-nilly manifests itself. On the contrary, acorns become oaks because that particular kind of seed doesn't become an elm, not because they want to. As Anton says of Aristotle's teleology: All that can be said is that ends are natural and particular; and hence, while there is no "nature" that has no telos, there is no uniform telos for all beings. Since there is no particular form which is inclusively valid, and comprehends all other forms, actuality is not prescriptive but descriptive. . . .1A 5. Let me now return to Phi-ing causes K's to Psi. I have been arguing that the Psi is the determinate "end" of some given K where K's have specific "natures" and consequently certain 11 Cf. Anton, op. cit., p. 45 and p. 77. Wilfred Seilars, in "Aristotelian Philosophies of Mind," in R. W. Sel lars, McGill, and Farber (eds.), Philosophy for the Future (New York, 1949), distinguishes "capacity" as a "weaker" notion, from "disposition." He notes that "the Aristotelians, lacking the concept of a law of nature, had no clear theoretical understanding of a dispositional property." This is cer tainly true, both of Aristotle, as well as "the Aristotelians," but also, of many if not most contemporary writers! In this essay, Sellars' point is that the confusions stemming from an unclear notion of disposition led to the idea that "the nature of a thing" is the "ideal state" of the thing. This in turn lent support to an "abstractive" theory of science. But more interesting is Sellars' correct contention that modern Aristotelians make the same fundamental mistake as do positivists, the mistake of viewing those terms which are non-logical or do not refer to observables as merely "calculational devices" (pp. 556 ff). Indeed, pre cisely what is one doing when the label "disposition" is affixed? See our concluding remarks. 11 Randall, op. cit., p. 175. See also, Anton, p. 73. 14 Anton, p. 78. And compare the note on the previous page. Is it the</page><page sequence="6">ARISTOTLE, DISPOSITIONS AND OCCULT POWERS 683 "powers." I have also said that Aristotle's telic conceptual apparatus focused upon the various natures and their respective ends, and minimized, if not at times eliminated what in the jargon are called "efficient causes." To be sure his recognition that "powers" are not merely passive should have kept him from this overemphasis, but it apparently did not. But what is even more odd is the fact that his telic analysis is thereby robbed of much of what little explanatory power it does have. For to say only that something Psi's because it is a K, is not to say very much. (Indeed, it is to say something, though what it says is common sensical.) It amounts to saying that in fact (say) acorns become oaks (and not elm trees or palm trees). They are, in fact, the kind of thing that becomes an oak tree. Wood is the kind of thing that in fact burns, etc. But putting the matter this baldly makes evident three additional sorts of questions, namely: "Why do acorns become oaks?" meaning ambiguously, either "For what purpose?" or "What is it in the nature of the acorn which causes it to become an oak?" Or finally the different question may be raised: "What does one do to an acorn to make it become an oak?" To each of these questions, three quite different sorts of answers are appropriate. While Aristotle's telic analysis allows for all three questions?he sometimes asks and attempts to answer all three?it was the first, the "purpose" question, which quite naturally came to be associated with him. There are a number of reasons for this. First, his language is admittedly animistic.15 case that for the "Aristotelian" actuality was prescriptive, the nature of a thing being its "ideal state," or "ultimate end?" De Wulf, op. cit., p. 76 f., in explaining St. Thomas, says: "Since the same activities and transforma tions are continually recurring, we infer that there is in each being an inclination to follow a certain path, to obey certain laws. Deus imprimit toti naturae principia propriorum actuum?God has impressed upon every nature the principles of its peculiar activities." This is innocuous, descrip tive, teleology, even assuming God. But if we add to this "internal finality" an "external finality"?the tendency of all things to seek or aim at God?then we have a definitely extraneous and prescriptive teleology. Gilson, The Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas (Cambridge, 1929), speaks of Thomas' "radical metaphysical optimism" in which Thomas sees everything as ?xisting for "the sake of the collective perfection of the Universe," pp. 188 f.</page><page sequence="7">684 PETER T. MAN I CAS Second, it is natural for humans to think in terms of purposes and to project motives into non-human phenomena.16 Third, the teleological question coincides nicely with a theology whose Diety is the ultimate cause of all things. Fourth, within the range of Aristotle's main concern and main scientific successes?the range of living things?an answer in terms of purpose or "function" is perhaps most helpful. Fifth, an explanation in terms of purpose is psychologically satisfactory, if we suppose that all changes are for some purpose. Finally, Aristotle did not satisfactorily answer the other two kinds of questions. The third question?what does one do to an acorn to cause it to become an oak??demands an answer in terms of a law. In our jargon, given K, what Phi in what C causes Psi? The second question?what is it in the nature of an acorn which makes it become an oak??is more sophisticated and demands a theory.17 The answer to this question would supply us with an explanation of why K's in C Psi when they are Phi-ed. 6. There is an historical lesson to be learned here, and it will be profitable for us to follow out the implications of Aristotle's limitations. We may do this by alluding briefly to some remarks by two 16th century spokemen of the "modern" view of science. It is well known that Sir Francis Bacon rejected "Aristo telianism" on the grounds that it confused metaphysics with science. Like so many moderns, his main point seems to be that the doctrine of final causes is scientifically sterile. He says: For the handling of final causes, mixed with the rest in physical inquiries, hath intercepted the severe and diligent inquiry of all real 15 W. D. Ross, Aristotle, accounts for Aristotle's animistic language as a literary device and a concession to ordinary language, p. 81. Ross also argues that Aristotle's teleology is de facto. 16 For example, see Tylor, Primitive Culture (London, 1903). 17 The too often ignored Aristotelian doctrine of elements is Aristotle's attempt to satisfy this demand. Indeed, his treatment is crude, but what is historically more important is the fact that its crudeness results mainly from Aristotle's procrustean empiricism! Anton's treatment in op. cit. is important and space permitting his dis cussion would have been included here. Aristotle develops his "stoichiology" in De Generatione et Corruptione. Also see Solmsen, op. cit.</page><page sequence="8">ARISTOTLE, DISPOSITIONS AND OCCULT POWERS 685 and physical causes, and given men the occasion to stay upon these satisfactory and specious causes to the great arrest and prejudice of further discovery.18 It is clear from this passage that Bacon feels that "real and physical causes" are "efficient causes," and that the search for them is the proper task of science. And, as we have indicated, Bacon has reason to blame Aristotle for not focusing on this aspect of discovery. But it is interesting that he should say that final cause explanations are both "satisfactory" and "specious." We should want to say that if they are "specious," then they cannot be satisfactory. But Bacon has in mind Aristotle's biological examples and researches.19 Here, a "that for the sake of which" answer is satisfactory. To be sure such an answer does not forbid asking either of the other two sorts of questions, nor need it be the case that such an answer is occultly animistic or a function of "grand design" or anthropocentric. The danger, however, comes in assuming that a purpose answer is always satisfactory. Thus to the question: "Why do mammals have lungs?" we might satisfactorily reply, "To assimilate oxygen."20 But to the question: "Why do acorns become oaks?" a "that for the sake of which" answer simply fails, unless it is occult or appeals to design. The two claims made against Aristotelian science (page 678) therefore here come together. Either we are occult and explain, or we are not occult and do not explain. For by construing Aristotle's telic analysis as I have, to say that the "end" (or "form") of an acorn is an oak is to say only that that particular thing-kind behaves so-and-so and not some other way. But this is not much of an explanation. If we now look for a "better" explanation, the shortest route is to animize or appeal to design. The acorn, then, "wants" to become an oak, or it is becoming an oak for "the greatest good." William Gilbert's De Magnete, published in 1600, graphically reveals the effects of this dilemma of explanation. He notes that 18 Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning, Bk. II, section VII, par. 7. Bacon says that inquiry into final causes is appropriate, but for metaphysics, not physics. See the Novum Organon, aphorism 2. 19 He quotes Aristotle's reference to human eyelids in Physics, II, 8. 20 We might also have meant "Why lungs and not gills?" The answer to this question might appeal to Natural Selection or to genetic theory.</page><page sequence="9">686 PETER T. MAN I CAS his generation "has produced volumes about recondite, abstruse and occult causes and wonders. ..." His charge is documented in Book II, Chapter III with a summary of some opinions on the loadstone of his predecessors and contemporaries. For example, some thought that "the loadstone is a living thing and . . . iron is its victual." One Cornelius Gemma declared that "the loadstone draws iron to itself by means of invisible rods" and to this opinion, continues Gilbert, "he tacks on the story of the sucking fish and the catablebas." "Guilelmus Puteanus deduces the power of the loadstone . . . 'from its substantial form as from a prime motor or self-motor, and as from its own most potent nature and its natural temperament.'" So, continues the quotation, "'the loadstone attracts iron not without physical cause, and for the sake of some good.'" The Aristotelian language is as evident as the occult explanation. Gilbert adds others' claims that the loadstone's power is "sympathy," the "craving of strength and company," a "fellow feeling," and in the words of Cardinal Cusa, a "wonderful longing." Gilbert's reaction to this nonsense is worth quoting: These fights, seditions, conspiracies, in a stone, as though it were nursing quarrels as an occasion for calling in auxiliary forces, are the maunderings of a babbling hag. . . . But Gilbert's own "explanation" of the phenomenon of magnetism is disappointing. He says: "Magnetic bodies attract by formal efficiencies or rather by primary native strength." He adds later that magnetic coition21 is the act of the loadstone and the iron, not of one of them alone; it is, in his words, "entelecheia, not ergon; it is synentelecheia and conactus (mutual action) rather than sympathy." It is clear from these passages that Gilbert wishes to rid his analysis of animism. Indeed, most of the remaining pages is the report of a careful experimenter, who is seeking to isolate and control the circumstances under which attraction occurs. But the closest Gilbert ever comes to explaining magnetism is in his appeal to the Aristotelian "form" or "entelecheia" of each participant, a "form" 11 Gilbert does not like the word "attraction" for, he says, "where attraction exists, there, force seems to be brought in and a tyrannical violence rules. "</page><page sequence="10">ARISTOTLE, DISPOSITIONS AND OCCULT POWERS 687 which involves some unspecified "power." To be sure, given the limitation of his knowledge of the micro-structure of magnets and iron, he can do no more unless he is animistic. 7. In this concluding section, I shall try to connect what has been said so far to some difficulties in the contemporary disposi tional analysis. Some remarks by Arthur Pap both make this connection and focus the difficulties which I have in mind. It is often asserted that modern science differs from Aristotelian science [Aristotle's science?] in that it formulates laws of the observable behavior of things that are useful for predictions instead of offering pseudo-explanations of the observed facts in terms of occult "powers" ascribed to things.23 But in answer to this charge, Pap correctly asserts: "We can not agree that modern science does not ascribe powers, as distinct from manifest states, to things." Pap notes that Mach and Hertz, for example, wanted to eliminate the concept "force" from physics because "it was an anthropomorphic projection," and "as devoid of explanatory power as the Aristotelian concept of the natural place of a body. ..." Pap's answer to this proposal is worth quoting in full : But even a forceless system of mechanics cannot do without the con cept of mass, and the mass of a body is after all, its power to resist changes in its mechanical state. If the word "power" has too animistic a flavor, let us replace it by the more technical term "disposition" in the generalized sense that it is used in contemporary philosophy of science.33 I do not think that Pap is suggesting that simply changing the word rids us of the main problem, nor does it appear that Pap is among those who "assert that modern science differs from Aristo telian science" in having eliminated "pseudo-explanations" couched in terms of "occult powers." But the modern empiricist might here argue that "powers" are occult, while "dispositions" are not, on the grounds that "dispositions" are unpacked wholly in terms of the "observation language," while "powers" are not and 22 Arthur Pap, An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science (New York, 1963), p. 279. 23 Pap, op. cit., p. 279. Compare note 21 on the previous page. But how much of an advance has been made in either case?</page><page sequence="11">688 PETER T. MAN I CAS cannot be. But at least part of the present essay shows that such a distinction is untenable. For Aristotle, at least, a dynamis is understood only as it results in a certain "actuality," where the actuality is a brute fact. The big question is this : What is one doing when a power or a disposition is ascribed to a thing or person? Some modern empiricists would have us believe that we are merely summarizing a set of counterfactuals. If this were the case, then there would be no mystery nor occultism attached to either a power or a disposi tion. But neither would there be much explanatory power. What is being accomplished may be illustrated with a trite example. To the question, "Why did the window break? one might correctly and helpfully answer, "Because it was hit by a rock." The answer is helpful and explains because it singles out some one phi from among many possible phi's.24 But another, entirely different sort of answer could be given. For example, "Because the window is glass and glass is brittle."25 This answer does not single out a phi in explanation. Rather, it appeals to the fact that the thing in question is one of a certain kind of thing and that things of that kind have certain dispositions and therefore behave in determinate ways. In other words, glass things shatter; they do not (say) dissolve, etc. This answer, typical of the Aristotelian apparatus, also "explains," though it suffers from defects different from the "causal" answer in the preceding paragraph. In the first place, each answer omits what the other offers. That is to say, the answer, "Because it was hit by a rock," needs to be supplemented with, "Because it is glass and glass is brittle," and conversely, the latter answer needs to be supplemented with the former. But even more importantly, even the supplemented answers leave unanswered the more interesting question, "Why do brittle things shatter when struck?" Or more generally, "Why is it that K's psi when they are phi-ed?"26 To this question one cannot 24 Other possible answers include: "Because of the earthquake, the wind, the fire, etc." 25 Or "Because the window is plastic and plastic tears, etc." 26 See Wilfred Sellars, "Counterfactuals, Dispositions, Causal Modal ities," Minnesota Studies, Vol. II p. 263.</page><page sequence="12">ARISTOTLE, DISPOSITIONS AND OCCULT POWERS 689 simply say, "Because glass has such-and-such a disposition," or "Because glass-things have such-and-such a power," if indeed this only means, "If you were to strike x, then it would shatter." So interpreted, the circularity is all too obvious. On the other hand, these answers do explain if "powers" or "dispositions" involve a reference to something inherent in (say) brittle-things which is causally responsible for their shattering when struck. But this involves either an appeal to an occult and unobservable power (e.g., some animistic force) or an appeal to a theory which anticipates an explanation in terms of the un observable micro-structure of the thing in question. The scientific hacks referred to by Gilbert appealed to the former; Gilbert's empiricism, like Aristotle's, prevented him from doing either. While it must be said that positivistic tendencies in the last eighty years or so have been methodologically healthy for scientific procedure, the pendulum might very well have swung too far. Though we have ridded science of occultism, some empiricists urge us to attempt science in the way that Aristotle and Gilbert attempted it. In a study of B. F. Skinner's radical behaviorism, Michael Scriven has put the point extravagantly but forcefully. He says : It is not a special feature of mentalistic concepts that they cannot be given an explicit unambiguous definition in basic observation lan guage . . . but it is a feature of all useful scientific concepts.27 This essay does not, of course, touch on what seems to be the main problem at issue here. The problem I have in mind concerns the status of the distinction between "observation discourse" and "theoretical discourse," and their respective roles in scientific explanation. But at least I have tried to show that Aristotle was not an occultist and that while his conceptual apparatus lent itself to misconstruction, the cure was not to insist on a reduction to observation language, but rather to recognize the anticipatory and essentially theoretical character of many useful scientific concepts.
