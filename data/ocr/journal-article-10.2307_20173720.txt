For more than a decade Curwood had captivated readers with romantic tales set in the frozen North Country of Canada and Alaska. As hunter and adventurer, he had visited most of the places he had written about. Such was his fame in the 1920s that he would be ranked as one of the highest-paid writers in the world.4 With the revelation of his personal epiphany, Curwood implied that fiction and fact had fused into a blissful union. In God's Country: The Trail to Happiness, Curwood cast himself as the hero of his own romantic journey. The book, he stated, had been written at a wilderness cabin 1,500 miles north of his Michigan home. As he typed out the words of his creed, the birds had laughed and swooped around him; a menagerie of other creatures had skittered into view as if to commune with their newfound ally. He was alone, and utterly content, in the garden of nature. Yet in significant ways, the book was a lie: its image of the isolated, independent wilderness author was mosdy a fabrication, as Curwood had not made an extended trip to the Canadian backcountry in several years. Riding a crest of fame, he had become a literary deal-maker and film producer. In the process he had become ensnared in the machinery of business life, and the irony of this captivity gnawed at him. While he did find occasional solace in the Michigan woods, he was a thoroughly conflicted man. Plis effusive correspondence reveals him to have been expansive and vain, given to sweeping enthusiasms and intemperate outbursts. His health had broken down as early as 1911; by 1920 he was continually on the verge of incapacity. "[T|t is our nerves that kill us in the long run, our over-resdess minds, our worrying, questing brains," he wrote in God's Country, probably speaking more for himself than for the human condition.5 In 1921 Curwood entered a new arena of conflict in which his romantic conception of his own life clashed head-on with reality: conservation. Crusading for wildlife, Curwood declared his opposition to all that was "political." Believing that the reasons and methods for conservation were self-evident, he damned as an enemy anyone who disagreed with him. After years as an outsider he was elevated to the Michigan Conservation 3 James Oliver Curwood, God's Country: The Trail to Happiness (New York Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, 1921), 7. 4 Judith A.

By then his vanity had blinded him to the fact that well-meaning people could disagree. Six months into his tenure, Curwood?with eerie prescience?was casting himself as a martyr. Only his death, in August 1927 at the age of forty-nine, spared him from total ruin as a policymaker. His demise also put a premature seal on his reputation. Lionized by many, Curwood has been remembered as an outdoor Renaissance man?equally adept as adventurer, author, filmmaker, and conservationist. He has never received an honest and unblinking historical treatment, either from popular writers or from scholars.6 In the case of conservation, much can be revealed by such an inquiry. I will argue here that Curwood was a thoroughgoing antimodernist and that as such he was poorly equipped to understand or advance the conservation methodologies of the 1920s.7 At the same time, however, his backward-looking sentiments characterized much of the tension inherent in remaking the ravaged landscape of Michigan and other states. Conservation in the 1920s was a forward-looking movement in organization and method. But the essence of the work?preserving and restoring an environment associated with the wild past?often required that conservation be "sold" to the public through association with ideas that were distincdy backward-looking. In this sense, although Curwood failed 6 To date there is no satisfactory biography of Curwood. Eldridge's James Oliver Curwood is awkwardly written and much too admiring; it lacks historical context, footnotes, or bibliography. Curwood's autobiography, The Glory of Living, was first published in England about 1928. It was the basis for an American edition revised and updated by Dorothea A. Bryant, entitled Son of the Forests (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, 1930). The autobiographies are vintage Curwood, painting his life as a romantic adventure and neglecting some inconvenient episodes, such as his desperately unhappy (and reportedly violent) first marriage. A worshipful tome by Hobart D. Swiggett, James Oliver Curwood: Disdple of the Wilds (New York: The Paebar Company, 1943), mosdy just amplifies and embellishes Curwood's own legends of himself. Swiggett also takes on the futile (and from a cultural historian's viewpoint, largely unnecessary) task of trying to rescue Curwood's literary reputation. 7 For my understanding of antimodernism, I am relying on T. J. Jackson Lears: "The antimodern impulse stemmed from the revulsion against the process of rationalization first described by Max Weber?the systematic organization of economic life for maximum productivity . . . the drive for efficient control of nature under the banner of improving human welfare; the reduction of the world to a disenchanted object to be manipulated by rational technique." Antimodernism supplied a critique of all bureaucratized, rationalized systems, whether capitalist or socialist. T. J.

His fiction?dramatic, overwrought, and hugely popular in its day ?resonates with the same antimodernist ideas that informed his conservation work. For Curwood, the literary conventions of romance and melodrama were more than a means to a paycheck: they constituted a worldview. Good and evil were plain to see, he believed, and the route to achievement lay in self-mastery and individual heroism. The wilderness provided an environment where valiant men and virtuous women could claim their destinies free of societal encumbrance. Curwood saw a stark dualism between human beings and nature and was deeply ambivalent about the coming of "civilization" in any setting. Rejecting literary naturalism, he idealized the wilderness as a setting where small numbers of people might find happiness through their own energies. Appealing as it was in fiction, this scheme was grossly unsuited to conservation work in the 1920s. In tune with larger social trends, conservation in the New Era was largely a matter of developing legal and economic means for instilling predictability and stability into previously unregulated land use.8 In Michigan much of this effort was applied to the "cutover," those millions of northern acres that had been stripped of their trees and then sold to speculators or abandoned. As early as 1919 the widespread failure of cutover farming drew attention from a handful of experts, notably the Ann Arbor forester Parish Storrs Lovejoy. By 1930 these experts had developed better means of fire protection, tax laws to encourage reforestation, and land-use surveys to discourage farming on poor cutover soils. Fish-and-game management, too, was being rationalized under state control to provide a steady "crop" of animals for harvest by sportsmen. Far from being a "wilderness," the regrown forest would be a deliberate creation by the collective human forces of law, science, and administration.9 8 Trie rise of a managerial society is outlined in Guy Alchon, The Invisible Hand of Planning Capitalism, Social Science, and the State in the 1920s (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985). 9 For the general contours of conservation work in Michigan during the 1920s, see James Kates, "The Conservationist as Journalist: P. S. Lovejoy and the Fight for the Cutover," American Journalism 12 (Spring 1995): 123-41; Norman J. Schmaltz, "P. S.

Lovejoy was, in succession, a forestry professor at the University of Michigan, a freelance writer on conservation issues, and a wide-ranging "idea man" within the Michigan Department of Conservation. The most comprehensive study of legal-economic conservation mechanisms deals with Wisconsin; the laws adopted there were</page><page sequence="6">78 Michigan Historical Review To be sure, nonspecialists could participate in this process?and often did. The most successful of these activists championed collective measures by invoking the mythology of the frontier past. Scientific forestry, for example, was touted as a means of reviving the hardy individualism celebrated in Paul Bunyan lore.10 But the path to success was strewn with hazards. Historian Stephen Fox speaks aclmiringly of "radical amateurs," those persons who have influenced conservation policy from the periphery of power, largely through their writings. But Fox does not adequately contend with his heroes' shortcomings, in particular their difficulties in translating their moral fervor into policy.11 Here Curwood's chief failing was his stubborn belief that truth in nature was divinely revealed rather than humanly constructed. He insisted that the "voice of nature" spoke to him personally and that its wisdom would be revealed to anyone who would listen.12 He was impatient with incremental effort and intolerant of differing viewpoints. Most glaringly, he was oblivious of the need for "reimagining" the landscape by coupling legal and economic means with conscious mythmaking.13 Curwood never distinguished myth from hard fact. His conservation crusade thus became a blunt instrument, without nuance or any awareness of irony or contradiction. In real life Curwood the storybook hero seemed fated for a tragic ending. similar to those in Michigan. See Erling D. Solberg, New Laws for New Forests: Wisconsin's Forest-Fire, Tax, Zoning, and County-Forest Laws in Operation (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1961). The darker side of the cutover revival, including paternalism and class contempt on the part of university elites, is dealt with in Robert J. Gough, "Richard T. Ely and the Development of the Wisconsin Cutover," Wisconsin Magazine of History 75 (Autumn 1991): 3-38. 10 A noteworthy Michiganian of this group was Harold Titus, a Traverse City novelist, outdoor writer, and member of the Conservation Commission. Invoking the myths of individualism, Titus campaigned for scientifically directed reforestation in the polemical novel Timber (Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1922). 11 See Stephen Fox, The American Conservation Movement: John Muir and His Legacy (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981). Fox makes sporadic, admiring mention of Curwood, particularly of his pantheistic creed. 12 Swiggett, Curwood, 185. 13 In this context "reimagining" means taking the abstract and making it concrete. The engineers of the cutover revival envisioned a replanted and continuously productive landscape yielding tangible products such as timber and intangible social amenities such as recreation. Not only did they have to design the legal and economic mechanisms for bringing this about, but they also had to craft a social rationale under which the new forestry would be "sold" to a skeptical public. For the idea of "reimagining," I am indebted to Father Michael Himes of Boston College, who employs the term in a theological setting.

The family moved to Ohio when Curwood was a toddler, but he returned to Owosso at age thirteen to live with his older sister and attend school. His parents soon followed. Curwood was to spend most of his life in Owosso, and he often referred to the city fondly. He left Owosso reluctandy to enter the University of Michigan, having bluffed his way through the entrance examination without benefit of a high school diploma. Evenings, he wrote adventure stories, a passion he had pursued since childhood. Some of his yarns were published in newspapers and in an obscure children's magazine, The Gray Goose. He left college in his junior year to work as a reporter in Detroit. His first novels, The Courage of Captain Plum and The Wo/f Hunters, were published in 1908. Thereafter, Curwood made his home in Owosso, traveled widely in Canada, and devoted most of his time to fiction.14 In fiction and in life, he had always craved adventure. As a child in Ohio he once drifted into Lake Erie on a flimsy raft, only to be rescued by a sailboat. Some years later he was nearly arrested when he and a friend embarked on a barnstorming tour selling "Infallible Blood Purifier," a homemade patent medicine. At one point he lived for three weeks in a crude cabin in the swamps north of Owosso with an American Indian known locally as "Muskrat Joe."15 Even as a schoolboy, Curwood yearned to become a writer. But his literary education was narrow, focusing almost exclusively on the adventure genre. He pored over adventure stories in popular magazines and attempted to imitate their style. At first he wrote in longhand on scraps of wrapping paper, which he bundled together as stories and novelettes. Later his parents bought him a secondhand typewriter. The author's craft became an obsession: as a youth he apparendy wrote hundreds of thousands of words that went unpublished. From Curwood's memoirs and the recollections of others, it is clear that the young writer viewed his own life as a nascent romantic fantasy. A life of letters would be a life of adventure and freedom: 14 Obituary in The New York Times, 14 August 1927. 15 Swiggett, Curwood, 102-03; Curwood and Bryant, Son of the Forests, 123-26. The incident on Lake Erie came after "Jimmy" Curwood brought a pistol to school and fired it to scare a group of girls in an outhouse. He ran away to "the sea" to escape the wrath of his parents.

He found it in Canada.

That year he met Malcolm V. Maclnnes, Canada's immigration agent in Detroit. "Mac's" chief duty was to induce Americans to take up farming on the Canadian plains. Because the prairies lacked romance, the jovial Maclnnes spent much of his time spinning stories of the Canadian North?the vast forests of the Canadian Shield, the glorious Rockies, and the tundra that stretched to the Arctic Circle and beyond. He introduced Curwood to a succession of picturesque and hardy Canadian visitors, from members of Parliament to rough-hewn trappers and lawmen of the Royal North-West Mounted Police. Well aware of a writer's promotional value, these Canadians enthralled Curwood with tales of the "almost unexplored wilderness of the north."18 With Mac's encouragement, Curwood began taking rail trips west from Thunder Bay to see the blossoming prairies for himself. But his real attraction was to the northern forests, which he explored in 1904 during a trip to the Lake Nipigon region of Ontario, where he discovered, and shot, wild animals in abundance.19 By 1908 when he was emerging as a novelist, Curwood was on the Canadian government's payroll, receiving $1,800 a year plus all expenses in exchange for unspecified boosterism on behalf of farming and tourism.20 He also bartered his influence in exchange for land in several Canadian communities.21 Although the land game enriched him, Curwood was never very interested in town-building. His heart lay in the unpeopled regions of the North. Soon Curwood was filling his tales with resdess and brave characters who chafed at modernity. The hero o? Philip Steele (1911) was a Chicago heir to millions, the toast of the country-club set with their "hot-house varieties" of urban amusement. But Steele had become a "hater of cities" and had renounced his fortune to ride with the Mounties in the wilderness: "Within himself he knew that he was unlike other men, that the blood in him was calling back to almost forgotten generations, when strong hearts and steady hands counted for manhood rather than stocks and bonds, and when 18 Eldridge, Curwood, 50; Curwood, The Glory of Living, 221. 19 Eldridge, Curwood, 53, 55. 20 Swiggett, Curwood, 137. 21 See, for example, correspondence regarding the transfer of two city lots in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: R.R.

Curwood negotiated similar deals in North Batdeford, Saskatchewan, and Port Arthur, Ontario.</page><page sequence="10">82 Michigan Historical Review romance and adventure were not quite dead."22 In Philip Steele, Curwood voiced considerable skepticism about the legitimacy of the law, a theme that grew stronger in his writings over time. Despite his admiration for the Mounted Police, he viewed their masters in Ottawa as vaguely sinister, incapable of distinguishing between true oudaws and those who had killed in the name of self-defense or honor: "Should I stand by and be shot like an animal just because it's the law that's doing it?" demands one character in Philip Steele.23 Justice and fair play, Curwood implied, were matters to be adjudicated by individual men, not by distant and unfeeling bureaucracies. The novel also recounted the legend of "Bucky Nome," a Mountie gone bad. Curwood insisted that the story was true, but the RNWMP brass were not amused. When a movie based on Philip Steele was released, it was banned in Canada.24 From his boyhood, Curwood possessed a streak of religiosity. In keeping with his temperament, the impulse was deeply personal and often floridly romantic. As a lad in Ohio he was taken to a Christian revival meeting where, to the astonishment of his school chums, he fell into paroxysms of ecstasy and leaped onto the stage to proclaim his conversion. He recalled that a beautiful angel with long, flowing hair followed him home across the farm fields that night. His newfound faith ebbed after several beatings from schoolyard bullies: "Slowly but surely I was licked back into mental health again."25 As a young man, Curwood formulated a new creed. True religion, he believed, was a matter of personal conviction based on the immanence of God in all things. To believe in God, one merely had to look at nature, as the glory of creation was self-evident. But religion had been corrupted by civilization: human beings?including, apparendy, the disciples of Christ?had obscured the truth with layers of interpretation, rules, and hierarchical structure. As with the law, Curwood was dubious of religious 22 James Oliver Curwood, Steele of the Royal Mounted (New York: Triangle Books, 1938; originally published as Philip Steele, 1911), 9-10. 23 Ibid., 186. In Philip Steele, Curwood also expressed unease over modern science. One of the novel's characters is a neurologist who has carried out a "great love experiment." The doctor once theorized that the "divine spark of love" between men and women did not exist and that people were in fact machines ruled by "low passions." As one might expect in a Curwood work, the theory?which smacked vaguely of Freudian psychology?turns out to be wrong. Steele of the Royal Mounted, 218-28. 24 Eldridge, Curwood, 89. 25 Curwood, The Glory of Living, 28-31. Curwood had an almost fetishistic attraction to women's long hair. Every one of his fictional heroines had it, and when he produced motion pictures from his books every actress had it as well.</page><page sequence="11">James Oliver Curwood 83 belief that was dictated by one's "betters." Just as true justice lay in the breast of the individual, so did the idea of God. Jesus had been a great "lover of nature" who had shed his "egoism" and recognized the dignity of all life. His followers had corrupted his teachings, twisting them into "a faith written in parables and riddles."26 Curwood rejected the central tenet of Christianity: that every human being had fallen and needed redemption through Christ. Christianity, in this sense, ran counter to Curwood's romantic inclinations; it contradicted his stubborn belief that people (at least some of them) were capable of complete goodness. Curwood's theology was attractive on paper but limited in its applicability. If God existed in nature, then God could be seen most clearly in places where nature was unspoiled. As expressed in the tides of several of Curwood's books, the wilderness was literally "God's Country." The problem, however, was that this conception meant that God dwelled where the vast majority of people did not. iCWe have no churches," one wilderness character declares in a 1911 Curwood story. "Our God is about us, in the forests, the swamps, the night play of the aurora."27 Foreshadowing his experience with conservation politics, Curwood spurned organized religion as cumbersome and obfuscating. He failed to recognize that religion meant more than personal experience, that it also represented an idea of how to live in a human community. He was incapable of bringing his "pantheistic heart" to bear on human ethics.28 Curwood's ideas of God and nature were always intertwined; but they would be indelibly fused on a fateful day in 1914 when, alone and unarmed in the wilds of British Columbia, Curwood came face-to-face with "Thor," a twelve-hundred-pound grizzly bear. In 1916 Curwood would immortalize 26 Curwood, God's Country, 99-101. 27 James Oliver Curwood, "The God of Her People," Pearson's Magazine 26 (December 1911 775. 28 Curwood, God's Country, 13. Curwood believed that some clergymen had employed the Bible to justify the destruction of nature in the name of man's "dominion" over the Earth. Although this was true enough, ideas of God, like ideas of nature, are historically constructed and change over time in response to human needs and human structures of influence. In the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Bible a careful reader will find much support for an environmental consciousness, through concepts such as "stewardship." The exegesis of these values?and their application in the world?requires concerted effort in human institutions, a process for which Curwood had no patience.

The bear rears up in terrible fury?but decides he cannot attack this tiny and helpless being: "Thor was not, like man, a murderer." The grizzly ambles off, and Langdon is converted to bear-worship. "You great big god of a bear!" he gasps. "You?you monster with a heart bigger than man!"31 One of Thor's keenest instincts, in Curwood's telling, was that man was his enemy and that human beings were invaders in the wilderness. The "man-smell" burned in his nostrils like a "plague."32 Did this mean that God dwelled in a place where man did not belong? Did it mean that humans were defiling the Earth with their presence? Curwood never addressed these questions. At most he recognized the spiritual and intellectual quagmire they entailed and decided not to press them to their full conclusions. It is difficult to say exactiy what prompted Curwood to jump into Michigan conservation work. Perhaps it was the success of his novels, which boomed in popularity with The River's End m 1919. With fame and fortune assured, the author may have felt free to cast about in other fields. More likely conservation was a release from the workaday pressures of literary life and moviemaking.33 Conservation appears to have given him an opportunity to apply his ripening personal creed to public life. It is likely too that Curwood conceived of conservation work in unambiguous, individualistic, heroic terms?in sharp contrast to the demands of literary celebrity. Curwood the conservationist made a spectacular public debut: on a Friday evening two weeks before Christmas 1921, he bounded onto the stage at an Elks Club in Flint, Michigan before an eager audience of eight 31 Curwood, The Bear, 166, 168. In the novel, Curwood suggested that bears had the capacity for love, friendship, paternal care, and loyalty. In doing so, he opened himself to accusations that he was a "nature faker" who gave his animal characters human qualities. See H. Allen Anderson, The Chief: Ernest Thompson Seton and the Changing West (College Station: Texas A &amp; M University Press, 1986), 123. Curwood confined his anthropomorphism mostly to ursine thought and instinct, not actions. At the end of the novel Langdon releases a captured bear cub, who sleepily finds his way back to Thor: "After that long and soundly they slept. And it may be that they dreamed." Curwood, The Bear, 189. 32 Ibid., 26. 33 The film business in particular appears to have been both exhilarating and galling to Curwood. Acting as his own producer, he took enormous risks?artistically and financially?to make screen versions of books such as Back to God's Country and Nomads of the North. After the early 1920s he left the moviemaking to others.</page><page sequence="14">86 Michigan Historical Review hundred sportsmen.34 Speaking fluendy and forcefully, he leveled a number of charges against Michigan's conservation apparatus. Incompetent men, he claimed, had been appointed as game and fire wardens in exchange for political favors. Because wardens were drawn from local communities, they often winked at fish-and-game violations by friends and neighbors. Concerned only with cronyism, state officials were standing idly by as forest fires ravaged the cutover. The chief problem, as Curwood saw it, was the lax attitude of Michigan's governor, Republican Alex J. Groesbeck, and his conservation director,John Baird. Curwood's audience satin rapt attention through a speech exceeding two hours: "At times when he paused and announced he was about to spring some new sensation the big room was so still one could hear the proverbial pin drop."35 What was the impetus for Curwood's new crusade? He seems to have been scarcely aware of conservation's legal, economic, and organizational revolution then in progress. Instead he had gathered his evidence firsthand, by walking through the denuded forest lands of northern Michigan. By the middle of 1921 he had become "indignant and disgusted" at the situation.36 He had seen the devastation wrought by fire and had detected a general decline in the abundance of game animals and birds. Hearing tales of corruption, laziness, or incompetence among fire and game wardens, it was simple enough for Curwood to conclude that the sorry state of Michigan's natural resources was due to "politics." To the extent that his ethos was worldly at all, it harked back to the Progressive Era: animals were disappearing and forests were burning because bad men were in power. The solution was to replace bad men with good ones, ridding the system of "politics" and elevating scientific expertise and "efficiency" in its place. As the need for conservation was self-evident, the people of Michigan?possessed of an instinctive virtue?would do the right thing if "politics" could be swept aside. Curwood outlined this faith to a member of the Conservation Commission: 34 In the early 1920s Curwood was astute enough to know that most of his support would come from hunters and fishermen. Therefore he emphasized conservation as a means of preserving hunting and fishing for future generations. He had given up big-game hunting by this time but sought only to regulate?not ban?hunting by others. Only in the last year of his life would his ethos become radical, approaching what today would be termed an "animal rights" ethic. 35 Curwood to Alex. W.

The average man is honest, and therefore, the average commonwealth is honest, and the commonwealth of Michigan will stand strongly behind honest endeavors.37 On the heels of the Flint meeting, Curwood issued a string of press releases and granted interviews decrying the destruction of Michigan's resources. Reporters enjoyed visiting him at his home in Owosso, where the floors were covered with bear rugs and the walls with original paintings of woodland scenes. Curwood was good company and "good copy"; the journalists scribbled dutifully as he fumed and enthused. The corruption of the Groesbeck regime was a constant refrain. In his correspondence Curwood sought signed affidavits?"red-hot sworn testimony," as he called it?attesting to the rottenness of John Baird's wardens.38 Other than that, Curwood's specific enthusiasms appear to have been chosen almost at random, often at the prompting of others. Early in 1922 he latched on to a seasonal theme: "We are cutting at least a million Christmas Trees in Michigan each year. ... [I]t is unwarranted destruction."39 His penchant for publicity did not go unnoticed. In Ann Arbor, P. S. Lovejoy watched the newspapers with a mixture of amusement and concern: Curwood, he felt, was a potential loose cannon. In a cautious and thoughtful letter sent just after the Flint meeting, Lovejoy sought a basis of understanding. Public sentiment, Lovejoy told Curwood, had to be cultivated in tandem with conservation methodology. Ousting bad politicians was not enough; a "new and more adequate machinery" of conservation had to be put in place.40 In reply, Curwood was largely 37 Curwood to T. F. Marston, 15 July 1921, Box 1, Curwood Papers. 38 Curwood to J. W. Tracy, 5 January 1922, Box 1, Curwood Papers. 39 Curwood to W. A. Brewer, 2 January 1922, Box 1, Curwood Papers. A litde math and some basic silviculture belie Curwood's alarm. Planted at ten-foot intervals, a million Christmas trees would occupy about three and a half square miles (about 2,300 acres). Assuming that a tree needed ten years to reach cutting size, a plot of just 23,000 acres (about six by six miles) would generate a million trees a year in perpetuity, providing employment, tax revenue, and a modicum of game habitat and scenery in the process. Properly managed, a Christmas-tree farm was a microcosm of the cutover revival as many planners envisioned it. 40 P. S. Lovejoy to Curwood, 14 December 1921, Box 1, Curwood Papers. Lovqoy's letter is noteworthy for its formal style. He reserved his quirky brand of syntax?"Lovejoyese," one admirer dubbed it?for people he knew and trusted. Lovejoy asked Curwood not to</page><page sequence="16">88 Michigan Historical Review oblivious to Lovejoy's message. Without an entirely new political regime in Lansing, Curwood wrote, "I feel that we . . . will accomplish practically nothing." Asked to supply specifics of his program, Curwood provided none.41 Lovejoy would try on several occasions to sell his land-use ideas to Curwood, but to no avail. After one typically detailed Lovejoy missive, Curwood was unmoved and apparendy uncomprehending: "I surely hope that a man who means as much as you do to conservation . . . will not for a minute allow himself to be blinded or mislead [sic] by a lot of talk and theory while the thing we want is immediate action."42 Lovejoy's caution soon turned to disgust. On 10 February 1922 he took the morning train to Owosso and met Curwood for the first time. After a strategy session the two proceeded to Flint, where they both were to speak to another sportsmen's gathering. With tensions between Curwood and John Baird at fever pitch, Lovejoy had cautioned Curwood not to drag him into any personal or political fracas. But he was nonetheless impressed by Curwood's publicity "machinery" and eager to use it.43 By Lovejoy's account, the evening was an "abortion," with Curwood hogging the spotlight and the attention of reporters. "He seems to be sincere but if he really knows anything about 'conservation, propagation and reforestation' I didn't discover it," Lovejoy complained.44 In time Lovejoy would acknowledge that Curwood had won the attention of Lansing politicians by "beating them over the head."45 But he would never take the author into his confidence. In the meantime Curwood had run squarely into one of the contradictions in his own logic: if he was constandy calling for the ouster of Governor Groesbeck, he had to advocate someone to take his place. As much as he claimed to abhor "politics," such entanglement could hardly be avoided. At the meeting with Lovejoy in Flint, Curwood had impulsively raised his glass in a toast to industrialist Charles Stewart Mott, hailing him as "Michigan's next governor." The toast made headlines and angered other potential candidates, especially Fred W. Green of Ionia, a furniture manufacturer and progressive Republican.

As it turned out, Mott decided not to run. Curwood eventually endorsed the Democratic nominee, corporate lawyer Alva M. Cummins, in the race against Groesbeck. In correspondence and press interviews Curwood boosted Cummins as a conservation candidate. Only after being goaded by Lovejoy, though, did Curwood contact Cummins to seek his actual views on the subject. Cummins's answer was a study in meaningless equivocation: I want to assure you that irrespective of all politics, it is my desire to see the wild life and forests of Michigan cared for as they should be cared for. ... I must confess, however, that I have not given . . . such attention to the details of the proper conservation policy to justify me in committing myself definitely to particular proposals. ... I am assuming, however, that policies favored by those who have given it careful consideration are apt to be right.47 Despite Cummins's bland reply, Curwood still insisted that the candidate was "100 percent" for conservation. By this time Curwood clearly fancied himself a kingmaker. But the illusion soon fell apart. Just before the 1922 election he bragged to forester Filibert Roth that "the time is coming when the forming of a conservation commission will be largely up to me."48 Then Alva Cummins lost badly and Groesbeck continued as governor until the end of 1926.49 With his enemy 46 Fred W.

Roth, an elder statesman of forestry, was one of Curwood's more steadfast supporters in the scientific community. He served on the Michigan Conservation Commission but quit in 1922, disgusted with the political infighting that came with the job. 49 Curwood's charges against Groesbeck and Baird appear to have been about half correct. According to his biographer, Groesbeck was a brusque and forceful leader who nonetheless possessed certain conciliatory skills. Taking office in 1921, he recognized the need for administrative streamlining; among his early accomplishments was a sweeping government reorganization that among other things created the new Michigan Conservation Department and the Conservation Commission that oversaw it. Conservation Director Baird was not a trained scientist. But Eugene Thor Petersen, a historian of the period, says that Baird?though chosen for his "political affiliations"?was "far superior" to his predecessors in conservation work. Michigan would make significant progress in conservation during Groesbeck's tenure, including the advent of Lovejoy's land-econor* v- survey and better</page><page sequence="18">90 Michigan Historical Review firmly entrenched, Curwood wearied of the fight. For the next few years his conservation zeal took other paths, including active involvement in the new Izaak Walton League. Here, as before, he was vocal, flamboyant, impulsive, often imprudent?and, in ways difficult to measure, highly influential.50 In 1922-23 the citizens of Owosso witnessed the construction of a most unusual workplace: it was a replica of a gatehouse to a Norman casde, with walls sixteen inches thick, overlooking the Shiawassee River. The interior was dominated by an impressive "great room" with massive furniture and heavy draperies. Narrow steps led to the basement, which the owner liked to call "the dungeon-room." Anyone seeking entry on weekday mornings encountered a sign: HALT! Mr. Curwood cannot be interrupted now. He is doing original work. Please Call Again.51 Architectural modernism was not to Curwood's taste: "Curwood Casde," as he called his new studio, was a throwback to the days of medieval chivalry. The new edifice said much about his life. Typing away at his desk in the casde turret, Curwood constructed more best-selling tales of the wilderness; forest-fire protection with the aid of federal money. Political patronage in conservation jobs would remain a problem until the late 1920s, when the system was put under civil-service rules. Curwood's mistake lay not in criticizing Groesbeck/Baird, but in assuming that nothing could be done until they were gone. Frank B. Woodford, AlexJ.

Dilg would be accused of malfeasance and deposed by the league in 1926. Typically, Curwood rushed into the fracas and became Dilg's passionate supporter. Curwood quit the league in protest, to the accompaniment of much publicity. Eventually, as the evidence against Dilg mounted, Curwood stepped back from the battle. Dilg died of cancer in March 1927. 51 Ivan A. Conger, "Curwood Casde," brochure [n.d.] issued by Owosso Historical Commission, available at Curwood Casde. Curwood Casde is now open to the public as a tourist attraction.</page><page sequence="19">James Oliver Curwood 91 but as time wore on and critics bemoaned the sameness of his novels, he shifted to historical romance.52 Instead of finding refuge in the woods, he found it in the past. Yet the theme remained the same: history, like the wilderness, furnished a landscape that he could populate with strong men, virtuous women, and unambiguous tales of individual heroism, unburdened by the constraints of modernity. His friend and editor Ray Long, a city man who viewed Curwood as his alter ego, put it apdy: "[TJhere is a fine strain of sincerity in James Oliver Curwood that does not vary with varying conditions."53 Curwood's unease with modernity is seen most clearly in his novel 1 Gentleman of Courage (1924). Set on the north shore of Lake Superior, it tells the typical Curwood story of masculine bravery, feminine virtue, and the triumph of good over evil?"rather a standardized product," one critic yawned.54 Yet it is unusual for its setting: geographically, the story takes place closer to "civilization" than any other Curwood novel since The Courage of Captain Plum sixteen years before.55 In A Gentleman of Courage, Curwood tells the story of a fixed human setdement. But in tying himself to one place, he displays a severe anxiety over the workability of several human institutions: organized religion, the law, large-scale capitalism, and by implication at least, even conservation. As opposed to his wanderers m the wilderness, who are faindy plausible, Curwood's village-dwellers have a sense of unreality about them. Though Curwood certainly did not intend it so, A Gentleman of Courage reads almost like a Utopian fantasy.56 The action is set in the tiny community of Five Fingers, named for the inlets of Lake Superior that reach toward the town. Five Fingers is a park-like litde setdement, populated by a few dozen jolly people who are 52 As a place for serious work, the "Casde" may have been too showy even for Curwood's taste. He did much of his writing in his parents' home, where the currents of nostalgia ran strong. Curwood Casde was the site of frequent business meetings, however, and film directors brought stars and starlets there to audition for parts in Curwood pictures. 53 Ray Long, "James Oliver Curwood and His Far North," The Bookman 52 (February 1921): 492-95. 54 Anonymous, "On Superior's Shore," The New York Times Book Review, 27 July 1924, 18. 55 Written before Curwood found his voice as a wilderness author, Captain Plum was a historical novel set among the Mormons on Beaver Island in Lake Michigan.

Its economic sustenance comes from a communal sawmill. The town's only connection to the outside world is a black tugboat. Aside from this tug?an "ugly thing" that "did not belong at Five Fingers"?the community is entirely self-sufficient and harmonious.57 Into this setting comes Peter McRae, a boy who has been wandering in the forest with his father, Donald. Donald McRae is wanted by the provincial police for the slaying of a man in self-defense. Under hot pursuit, Donald sends Peter to Five Fingers, where he is taken in like a son. Donald McRae meanwhile is chased through the wilderness by police for several years and driven to madness. At Five Fingers, young Peter's sole enemy is Aleck Curry, the son of the tugboat captain. Aleck?the emblem of outside capital and corruption?is the only person at Five Fingers who is not physically attractive; he has a "large, coarse face" and close-set beady eyes.58 Aleck's father has grown rich from timber contracts granted by corrupt politicians; Aleck's uncle, who is politically connected, becomes commissioner of the provincial police. Not surprisingly, as Aleck grows into manhood, he becomes a bully on behalf of the government by joining the police force. It is Aleck who hounds Donald McRae to the point of insanity; it is Aleck who, at the end of the novel, falls from a cliff at Five Fingers to what the narrative portrays as a well-deserved death. The lakeside paradise is saved, but what strikes the reader is its extreme fragility. Aleck Curry possesses the ability to "destroy everything" that makes Five Fingers "a fit place to live in." The law is blundy omnipotent, with litde capability for distinguishing between criminals and honest men. A policeman's badge can be a refuge for "blood-sucking ferrets," one character declares.59 At Five Fingers order and justice spring from the hearts of the people, not from the dictates of some outside force. Conservation does not fare much better. Pierre Gourdon, one of Five Fingers' hardy founders, regards every tree as a "word of God"; he mourns the sacrifice of timber in the community's "droning, merciless" sawmill but does not voice his lament aloud.60 Apparendy the only thing saving the forest is the smallness of the community; Five Fingers can live in balance with nature only as long as it is tiny and isolated. Clearly its worst possible fate would be to grow. 57 Ibid., 101. 58 Ibid., 214. 59 Ibid., 256, 265. 60 Ibid., 21-22.</page><page sequence="22">94 Michigan Historical Review Here one sees a link to Curwood's theology, which identifies the wilderness as "God's Country" and inhabited places as something less. People "buried in the darkness of cities" cannot hear the birds sing, Donald McRae tells Peter, and because the birds are animated by God, city-dwellers are cut off from the Creator's voice: "Always think kindly of people in the cities, Peter. They are unfortunate." His words are echoed by Father Albanel, a wandering clergyman who has "no setded church" other than "ten thousand square miles of forest land." Father Albanel preaches an evanescent creed of nature-worship, without hierarchy, rules, traditions, or fixed beliefs, except a sort of hazy virtue to be found in the pines. His followers in Five Fingers are "free and easy and refreshingly happy," but there is no sense that his gospel could take hold in the city, where the handiwork of God is not self-evident.61 Egged on by editors and critics, in the 1920s Curwood sought a formula that reconciled modernity and romance. He was only pardy successful. "Just as soon as I get out of the northland [as a setting for fiction] I lose my love for work," he confessed to Ray Long.62 In The Ancient Highway (1925), Curwood went so far as to place much of the action in a city.63 But the city in question was Quebec, whose crumbling fortresses offered the hero, Clifton Brant, an avenue of escape through history. Brant retraces the migrations of his heroic ancestors, who included an "Indian princess."64 He meets up with Gaspard St. Ives, who seems a quintes s entially modern character: he is managing a huge tract of timber in the Quebec wilderness. But Gaspard, it turns out, is a man very much after 61 Ibid., 100,20,146. Of all organized religions Curwood professed the most admiration for Catholicism. There were two reasons for this: first, Catholicism was the creed of the Jesuit missionaries and many French-Canadian pioneers, so the faith was tied up with notions of adventure and romance; second, like many antimodernists Curwood embraced the Catholic Church's sense of mystery and pageantry as an alternative to Protestant sects' increasing rationalism and worldliness after Darwin.

Curwood often claimed that his own great-grandmother had been a beautiful full-blooded Mohawk Indian. In middle age Curwood developed a streak of white in his hair, which he attributed to his Indian ancestry. Curwood wrote about his real-life ancestors in the same florid style with which he described his fictional heroes. His great-grandfather who married the American Indian was "big and blond, smoked a long pipe and loved the wilderness." Curwood described his own father as "the finest, cleanest, bravest, most honourable Dad that ever lived."

He lives in an ancient casde, because the stone walls evoke for him "something of the idealism and glory and thrill of a wonderful past." He "loves trees more than he does people."65 Gaspard eschews the cool rationality of land economics; instead he is engaged in forestry because it recalls for him images of history and tradition. In The Ancient Highway Curwood revealed his limits as a chronicler of modernity. He could abide Western civilization only if it evoked half-accurate images of people long dead and events long past. He was deeply apprehensive about the workability of almost all organized solutions to problems of human existence. Truth in nature was self-evident to him, as were the means of protecting nature. Above all, there was good in the world and there was evil, and any reasonable person could see the difference between them; to fail triumphandy was better than to compromise. With such firm and dangerous beliefs Curwood entered the final phase of his career. In November 1926 Fred Green won the Michigan governorship. At the end of December he named Leigh J. Young, a University of Michigan forestry professor, as head of the Conservation Department. And on 4 January 1927, he appointed James Oliver Curwood to the Conservation Commission, expressing "great happiness" over the author's potential as a policymaker.66 Three of Curwood's fellow commissioners also were professional writers: the novelist Harold Titus; Lee Smits, outdoor editor of the Detroit Times-, and Norman Hill, editor of the Sault Ste. Marie Evening News. The other three were businessmen: Philip Schumacher of Ann Arbor; W. H. Loutit of Grand Haven; and Howard Bloomer of Detroit, who was the only holdover from the Groesbeck-Baird days.67 The Conservation Commission was primarily a policymaking body. A creation of Governor Groesbeck's 1921 administrative overhaul, the panel was intended to centralize oversight of conservation affairs and to make recommendations to the legislature. It had the power to set hunting and fishing seasons but usually delegated these politically sensitive matters to lawmakers.68 Curwood assumed his post with his customary zeal. The new commission met on 19 January and delighted Curwood by appointing him 65 Curwood,77tf An?ent Highway, 124-25. 66 Green to Curwood, 4 January 1927, Box 2, Curwood Papers 67 Clipping, Grand Rapids Herald, 6 January 1927, Curwood Scrapbook. 68 Michigan Public Act 17 of 1921, quoted in "The Department of Conservation: The Formative Years" (manuscript history on file at Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Lansing, n.d.), 250.</page><page sequence="24">96 Michigan Historical Review to head its committee on fish-and-game laws. Regrowing the forest would take decades, but the protection of wildlife seemed to him relatively simple: to save the remaining stocks of fish and game, Curwood believed, all that was necessary was to restrict their harvest. He had scarcely warmed his chair at that first meeting when he proposed that the killing of young buck deer (known as "spikehorns") be banned. The panel took the proposal under advisement.69 Back in Owosso, Curwood decided that the conservation emergency could not wait. By late January he had drafted a radical plan that called for halving the deer season (from fifteen days to seven), doubling deer-license fees, creating "sanctuaries" on trout streams where no fishing would be allowed, and shortening seasons on rabbits and other small game. The most inflammatory part of the plan was a three-year moratorium on the hunting of ruffed grouse, a staple of northern Michigan sportsmen. He sent each commissioner a copy. Already he had identified himself, Titus, and Lee Smits as the true "outdoor men" on the commission.70 And he feared?somewhat ironically, given his supposed support for scientific expertise?that Conservation Director Young might be too deliberative to meet the emergency. Young, Curwood confided to Governor Green, "has a long established background of acedemic [sic] training and opinion which tends to scientific and investigatory instead of heroic action."71 Curwood's fears soon materialized. At the February meeting his fellow commissioners sent several of his proposals?including the grouse-hunting ban?to the legislature with a favorable recommendation. But dissension was becoming apparent: Harold Titus and Norman Hill favored "a more 69 Michigan Department of Conservation, Proceedings of Conservation Commission, January 19, 1927 (Lansing: Department of Conservation, 1927). Here Curwood was following the lead of his heroes in the animal-protection movement, such as William Temple Hornaday, who believed the simplest way to protect animals was to stop their harvest by sportsmen. Other thinkers, such as Aldo Leopold, were starting to realize that fish-and-game management was far more complicated, involving such matters as habitat, co-dependence of species, and naturally occurring cycles of plenty and scarcity among game animals. But the Hornaday view was more popular during the 1920s. 70 Curwood to Titus, 25 January 1927, Box 2, Curwood Papers. 71 Curwood to Green, 22 January 1927, Box 2, Curwood Papers. Curwood's growing displeasure with Young was ironic, because Curwood had been so delighted at Young's appointment as conservation director just a few months before that he could not consign his pleasure to the US mail. He sent Young a telegram instead: "CONGRATULATIONS YOUR [sic] THE KIND OF MAN I HAVE FOUGHT TO GET FOR SEVEN YEARS." Curwood wire to Leigh Young, 31 December 1926, Box 1, Leigh J.

They passed a watered-down fish-and-game package containing none of the shorter seasons the commission had called for. Curwood's fellow commissioners, who may have been glad to pass the buck, nonetheless felt that the legislature had made a "sorry mess of fish and game measures," a reporter for the Detroit News concluded after lawmakers had gone home for the season.73 By April Leigh Young had learned of Curwood's disapproval, and he was not happy about it. According to the Detroit Free Press, the two men had a falling-out over the need for quick action on fish-and-game laws. Rumors swirled that either of them might quit at any moment.74 William B. Mershon, a Saginaw lumber merchant who had become one of Michigan's leading conservationists, urged Young to hold fast under Curwood's pressure: "Don't you let him drive you off the roost," Mershon wrote. "He is simply an impractical trouble breeder."75 Threats of resignation were all the rage that spring, as Curwood and Smits both talked of quitting after they quarreled over the commission's firings of high-ranking game and forest-fire officials. But the rift apparendy was patched.76 The personnel battles had deepened Curwood's conviction that Conservation Director Young was too much the careful academic and too litde the man of action. "The cry on Mr. Young's part to 'Go slow, go slow,' is all wrong," he complained to Harold Titus. "We haven't time to go slowly." As Curwood's impatience compounded itself, he hinted to Titus that the commission should seize the initiative and restrict hunting seasons on its own. At the June meeting he won a partial victory when the commissioners voted to ban grouse hunting for a year.77 In July Curwood lost patience and once again placed his program before the commissioners, asking them to take action where legislators had not. But the commissioners balked at the demand. Responding to the panel's reluctance to enact drastic game-law changes without public input, the Conservation Department had distributed 20,000 questionnaires asking 72 Clipping, Detroit Times, 2 February 1927, Curwood Scrapbook. 73 Clipping, The Detroit News, 9 June 1927, Curwood Scrapbook. 74 Detroit Free Press, 27 April 1927. 75 William B.

Although only about 2,000 had been returned by July, they showed a majority of respondents in favor of Curwood's ideas. Curwood called for a quick vote. But Commissioner Loutit advised that because only 10 percent of the questionnaires had been returned, action should be delayed.78 At that point, Curwood blew up. In a tirade which a reporter likened to "the storm scene by the Moscow Opera company," he accused his fellow commissioners of political cowardice.79 He pointed out that most respondents agreed with his plans. Curiously, he then argued that the responses did not matter anyway because the questionnaires had been distributed haphazardly and were subject to fraud. Apparendy without proof, Curwood claimed that a notorious poacher had filled out three of the forms, each time opposing Curwood's plan to protect "spikehorn" bucks. "If you want to take the word of that boodegger against mine, it is time I got off this commission," Curwood fumed.80 The "storm scene" succeeded, at least in the short run. Commissioners refused to enact the controversial "spikehorn" plan, but they did approve measures that reduced the taking of deer, rabbits, muskrats and squirrels.81 Weary of battle, Curwood retreated to his rustic lodge along the Au Sable River in northern lower Michigan. His agitated mind found no peace in the forest. He wrote conservation polemics for the newspapers and brooded over his own conservation ethos, which was rife with contradictions. Trying to mend fences with fellow commissioners, he declared that the commission was not "a political organization." But commissioners needed the support of the public if they were to gather their courage and take action. Sportsmen had only themselves to blame if the commission misjudged public sentiment, Curwood wrote.82 At the same time, he believed that the commission's mandate was far wider than simply satisfying the blood-lust of hunters and anglers. Curwood was never explicidy antihunting; he always left room for the shooting of game to meet human needs such as food. And he remained an occasional fisherman himself. But he never fully articulated the difference between legitimate sportsmanship and butchery. As a result, his generalized moral revulsion against blood sports culminated in the belief that sportsmen's wishes necessarily sprang from bad motives.

In my opinion these two men follow the destructive tendencies of the last commission and eternally have their ears to the ground to see what the hunters and fishermen are going to say .... In every instance they listen for the voice of the killer."83 Remrning to Lansing for the last time in August, Curwood mustered support for the "spikehorn" measure. With the four votes for passage apparendy secure, the Conservation Commission laid the matter over for a month. Curwood went home to Owosso feeling gloomy and feverish.84 For years his health had been perilous. In his writing he had bragged that he would live to be a hundred, thanks to exercise and the avoidance of red meat. But like many of his boasts, this one was an elaborate fantasy that belied the facts. For a decade now he had been genuinely famous, with all the clamor that fame entailed. He had written a novel a year, sometimes two; he had produced films and articles and stories; he had poured his limited energies into crusades that brought much frustration and litde joy. The functioning of his body mirrored all the excesses and vulnerabilities of his resdess mind and in August 1927 the pace caught up with him. A few months earlier he had suffered a leg wound?perhaps a sting or snake bite?while wading in a swamp in Florida. The pain had lingered despite treatment, and now it flared into a dangerous infection. Within a few days he was delirious. Although his daughter supplied a blood transfusion, and two doctors from Detroit arrived by airplane to attend him, it was to no avail. Curwood died shordy before midnight on 13 August.85 Meeting on 7 September, the Conservation Commission wrote an ironic remembrance for its late member by setting aside the "spikehorn" measure and rescinding earlier orders that had restricted hunting of rabbits and squirrels. The commissioners also lifted a two-year-old restriction on fish spearing in southern Michigan. In the words of one reporter, the "whole foundation of Curwood's conservation program . . . was torn to pieces with almost vicious delibera tenes s." Afterward, the commission unanimously approved a resolution mourning Curwood's passing and 83 Lee Smits to Curwood, 8 July 1927; Curwood to Smits, 11 July 1927, Box 2, Curwood Papers. 84 Detroit Free Press, 4 August 1927; Michigan Department of Conservation, Proceedings of Conservation Commission, August 3, 1927. 85 Eldridge, Curwood, 215, 224-27.

Tided Green Timber, it had remained uncompleted at the time of his death: he had finished six chapters and had outlined the remainder. A Curwood novel?even one half-finished?was too valuable to discard; so the manuscript and Curwood's notes had been farmed out to Dorothea A. Bryant, who was already updating and expanding Curwood's autobiography.87 Green Timber is not set in the wilderness, but rather in northern Michigan's cutover country. For Curwood this was an extraordinary concession. The cutover held only faint appeal for him; he had always invested his dreams in the "unspoiled" reaches of Canada and Alaska instead. The cutover smacked of politics and corruption and waste, of depleted forests and faded glories. But with the real-world problems of conservation pressing in on him, perhaps Curwood had felt the need to confront Michigan's situation direcdy. Green Timber tells the story of a petty criminal, Allan Campbell, who is being hunted by gangsters in Detroit and escapes to the cutover. There he undergoes a sort of moral regeneration, becoming a "sturdy frontiersman" and a crusading conservationist.88 In the end he defeats his gangland enemies in a gunfight along the Au Sable River. In Curwood's view the cutover is a "second-growth wilderness," a land that is thriving because it has been abandoned by man. Nature?not law or science or publicity or politics?is the sole agent of Curwood's cutover revival. Natural forces are turning the cutover into "one of the garden spots of the earth." Because human beings have taken their destructiveness elsewhere, the cutover has indeed become God's Country, a "land that men?but not God" have forgotten. The absence of law allows Curwood, and his redeemed gangster-hero, to reclaim the cutover as a romantic landscape. At the end of the novel, with bullets flying all around him, Allan Campbell finds time for a speech about the region's heroic possibilities. 86 Quotation, Detroit Free Press, 8 September 1927. The action on fish spearing appears to have been a direct rebuff to Curwood. In the months before his death, the author had produced a series of articles decrying the spear as a "barbed destroyer"; Michigan Department of Conservation, Proceedings of Conservation Commission, September 7, 1927. The following month, Conservation Director Young was fired by Governor Green, pardy because of his inability to control the Conservation Commission.

Bryant (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, 1930). 88 Ibid., 125.</page><page sequence="29">James Oliver Curwood 101 With the law far away, he proclaims, "wilderness" folks must take matters into their own hands: "In the cutover lands we are masters, for the law has abandoned us."89 Curwood's conception of the cutover was entirely wrong. In real life, the cutover bloomed because law was applied there, not because it was withdrawn. The revival of the forest involved the conscious projection of human values onto the landscape through the large-scale machinery of the state. Much of this machinery?including land-use surveys, timber-taxation laws, and organized fire protection?had come into being during the half-dozen years when Curwood was active in conservation. Under the tutelage of persons wiser than himself, such as Filibert Roth and P. S. Lovejoy, he had paid occasional tribute to these mechanisms. But as Green Timber showed, he had never abandoned his faith in the individual or his skepticism about the viability of the law. He could learn to love the cutover only by viewing it as a "new wilderness"?something it absolutely was not.90 Curwood was not, to be sure, the only conservationist who spun tales of wilderness adventures and pioneer fortitude. The remaking of the forest almost always involved the invocation of cherished American ideals. The foremost thinkers of the cutover revival knew that science alone would not suffice. Directing their messages to specific audiences, they leavened their facts with fancy, their mechanisms with myth. Yet these conservationists recognized that pioneer individualism would no longer suffice. Echoing Walter Lippmann, they realized that the story of the outdoors, in a modern age, must be one of "mastery," not "drift." To preserve a semblance of freedom, the idea of nature had to be codified, justified politically, and administered by the state. The new ethos was not without irony and contradiction, and the best thinkers knew it. Curwood, by contrast, was one-dimensional?but the single dimension he possessed was spectacular, even admirable, for all its blind zeal. An antimodernist at heart, he rejected the bureaucratic rationalization of his cherished woods. He identified the human heart as the locus of all good and evil and never strayed from that viewpoint. He never varied his message with the audience and never distinguished fiction from fact, myth from reality, or individualism from the imperatives of modernity. In Curwood's eyes there was only one story, and he probably saw himself as its hero. Yet even people who condemned Curwood as a fool?and there were many of them?were fascinated by his hold on the public imagination. 89 Ibid., 77,121,282. 90 Ibid., 297.</page><page sequence="30">102 Michigan Historical Review Curwood's presence was a reminder that not everything could be quantified and that the creation of a rationalized natural environment would depend on the evocation of sentiments that were nostalgic, mythical, even irrational. After his death Curwood's individualistic creed flowered through organized means, most notably in the wilderness movement.91 Like his valiant men of the North Country, the keeper of Curwood Casde had not labored in vain. James Kates received an M.A. in history from the University of Michigan in 1984 and a Ph.D. in mass communication from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1997. He is an editor at the Milwaukee Journal'Sentinel. 91 Curwood's ethos was essentially biocentric, meaning that he saw nature, not man, as the center of existence. Most 1920s conservationists, such as P. S. Lovejoy, conceived of the natural world in terms of what it could do for human beings. Man, Curwood wrote, "is the human peacock, puffed up, inflated, flushed in the conviction that everything in the universe was made for him?' As might be expected of Curwood, this idea was backward-looking in a sense; it owed much to Emerson, Thoreau, and John Muir. But Curwood, in his own blunt fashion, foreshadowed those ethicists who would invest nature itself with certain "rights," independent of human wishes.
