Storyline Ireland is a series of anthologies of original Irish short stories for 7-12-year-olds. The blurbs tell us that the stories may be read for pleasure, or may be used at school. This, as the reader soon finds out, is a giveaway, for again and again the suspicion arises that a story exists purely to illustrate some moral or slice of history. There is a story that improves the image of stepmothers; one that illustrates how barge-horses worked; one that dramatises Daniel O'Con nell's duel; one that discourages rabbit-hunting. A story called "The Engine" (about a remaking of the basic steam engine) puts it into words when Paddy's Uncle Jack asks, referring to the crowds that are following their finished engine, "Would there be as many as that after you if you walked down the street with a history book?" This is a laud able pedagogic method but is a turn-off in reading for pleasure. Children know when they're being patronised; it usually coincides with dullness. The worst offenders here are those stories with contemporary settings ? except for the charmingly anarchistic "William Brown Didn't Care", which is good in a contemporary manner, using a refrain-like repetition to great effect. Those stories with folklore sources generally work better. They have a level of inventiveness ? especially in the twists of plot, and small details ? that the other stories lack. Especially effective are "Me, Myself, about Conn and the Pookas, and "Coomara", with Jack and the merrow (or merman?) who hangs up lobster pots filled with sailors' souls. The series as a whole, however, with its mixture of story-types, and its transparent ambitions, is ill judged and offputting to any child already interested in read ing.

It is worthy, adjectival, over-alliterative and given to hyphenated coinages such as "whackety-crack", like Roald Dahl without his zaniness. An editor is needed. The story itself is slight ? a bird damages his beak on rocks and has to think up a way to avoid starvation; he hits on the idea of sitting under a bush, waiting for blackberries to fall into his mouth ? but likeable, until the sentimental ending. There is nothing wrong with the writing in Catherine Sefton's The Day the Smells Went Wrong, aimed at a younger readership than she normally writes for. The basic idea is simple ? everyday smells get switched, so toast smells of tar and tar smells of toast. This tactic gets a bit obvious and repetitive, though the story darts forward to school, and teachers' relationships, and the kids' canteen protest, with lightness of touch. I found the punning mix-up of 'spelling list', with 'smelling list', at the story's denouement, a bit corny. Catherine Sefton is better with her books for older children. In Bike Hunt, for 10-14 year olds, Niall's new racer gets stolen, so Niall, helped by friends Paudge and Katy, start a hunt. They soon discover an organised gang is behind the theft, but this gang gets caught up with an altogether more sinister gang who've kidnapped a German industrialist. Niall frees the German, and together they make a break for it through the Wicklow mountains, with the armed kidnap pers in pursuit. Katy organises Niall's rescue, using her father's ham radio station. At the same time she takes steps to ensure that her growing affections for Niall will be returned, despite the attentions of her rivals, the twins. The events are topical ? bike thieves cutting chains with a bolt cutter, the kidnapping of foreign industrialists ? the dialogue is contemporary; it is an authentic picture, as far as it goes, of young adolescents and their concerns. It is often funny, as when Katy takes image-lessons from her cousin, or when Paudge seriously slims. Perhaps the characterisation lacks some depth, especially when compared with Catherine Sefton's Shadows on the Lake which dealt with similar mate rial. But essentially it's a well-paced, racy adventure story which should, as the blurb says, be hard to put down. Julie O'Callaghan, in Taking my Pen for a Walk, makes the transition to a younger readership with ease. Her one Bike Hunt won the 1988 Irish Book A ward for young people's books. Other winners: p. 167. Poet Julie O'Callaghan is a librarian at Trinity College, Dublin. previous book of poems, Edible Anecdotes, though for the adult market, had little that was solemn or literary about it. Made up for the most part of scraps, memories, caught moments?fiercely colloquial, sometimes in Chicago dialect ? they presented a vivid, impressionistic picture of the America she grew up in. The same freshness is immediately apparent here, with a greater variety of approach. These poems cover much of the concerns of young teenagers ? their obsession with music; dreams of being stars; image consciousness; the inevitability of growing up whether one wants to or not. Once again, memories are the starting points for many of the poems ? poems that are dramatic, often wryly mysterious, funny and less casual than they seem. I particularly liked "Light the Lights" "Remember you're Chinese, OK? They aren't clod-hoppers in China, so when you make your entrance I want little teensy steps, like so." She bowed her head, holding her umbrella up high and tip-toed in. 'Sister in a Whale' is a beautifully surprising poem, that really makes something of its central metaphor of the sister living 'in the hollow of a stranded whale / lying on top of our house'. Often the whimsy works like this, making the reader see more clearly, though on occasions it grates ? as in the title poem with its too-easy anthropomorphism, or in 'Battle", whose snowstorm-enemy, 'howling, ruthless . . . outside", is a bit tired and obvious. Much better is "Backyard physics", with its clever angles and its wit. "Look at this basketball: Here we are up at the top. And here are the Chinese on the opposite side or in other words at the bottom. If you could see straight through the earth under your feet everything would be upside down. But you wouldn't notice because the gravity would stick you to the ground to keep you from falling off. Just think, all those Chinese living upside down and they don't even care. Aren't you glad we got stuck on the top?" We looked at the ground under our feet. We had never before understood the hardships of being Chinese. This is a book that will do missionary work for poetry, a book to leave out for babysitters and know they'll read it. I've tried it.</page></plain_text>
