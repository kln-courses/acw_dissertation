An important burial with Caribbean shell grave goods has been discovered in northwestern Belize at the site of Tulix Mul. Tulix Mul is a courtyard group with two large multi-roomed structures and five smaller structures (Fig. 1) surrounded by smaller dispersed mounds. Tulix Mul was uncovered in 2010, after forest clearing for agriculture (Hammond 2012), on the eastern edge of the Alacranes Bajo, a low-lying land feature that stretches from Belize into Mexico and Guatemala. This location gives Tulix Mul access to both bajo and upland re- sources (see Luzadder-Beach et al. 20 1 2 for discussion of the role of bajos in the Maya area). Excavations in 2012 uncovered a burial from the north- eastern residential structure yielded a spectacular collection of 52 shell ornaments (Back Cover and Fig. 2). The shells are carved into geometric shapes, stars, flowers, anthropomor- phic designs and one even looks like a slice from a vegetable such as a gourd. As well as the shell objects, there was a single ceramic sphere, which had holes drilled into it. The burial was found below the room's floor immedi- ately in front of and under a bench. The bench contained a complete, Late Classic (Tepeu 2/3) olla and ceramics in the construction fill under the floor date to the Early Clas- sic period. Under the floor was an articulated flexed burial, facing north. The burial was not intrusive and was placed on top of a cobble layer, with the head on top of a large round piece of chert when the room was constructed. Analysis of the skeleton will occur in 2013 to determine sex, age, and other information. The 52 ornaments were found behind the cranium, but not underneath it, indicating that these were components of either a necklace or a head-dress. As many of the ornaments had fallen into the fill, it was not possible to reconstruct the entire original order of the ornaments, however some were found in close proximity to one another, which may give an indication of at least how some were related to each other. Of the 52 shell ornaments, 46 were carved from conch, 5 are made of mother-of-pearl and 1 from a cowrie shell. All of the conch ornaments have a single hole in the middle, 14 of these are circular shapes of varying sizes with no other carvings; 4 are circles with carvings such as dots; 15 are star or flower shaped; 8 are of various geometric shapes with no further carving; 1 is shaped like a slice of a gourd; 2 may be anthropomorphic representations; 1 is a cross; 1 may be turtle shaped. The single cowrie shell is whole and has a hole drilled through it. The mother-of-pearl shells consist of 4 circular ornaments, and 1 broken square. The ceramic disc has a hole through the middle and 2 further holes on 2 of the edges. Shells are not just decorative objects, but are symboli- cally associated with water and the sea (Trubitt 2003) and in this case, they were imported from the sea. Tulix Mul is located roughly 6 kilometres from the Rio Hondo, an im- portant access route to the Caribbean Sea (Guderjan 2007). mexicon • Vol. XXXV • April 2013</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1. The Tulix Mul Courtyard Group and nearby structures (Map by Marc Wolf) Similar shell artifacts were fabricated on Ambergris Caye (Garber 1995) and this discovery strengthens our impression of close connections between the coast and interior and the connectivity of the Rio Hondo (Barrett and Guderjan 2006). The number of the shells may also be significant as 52 was an important calendric number.
