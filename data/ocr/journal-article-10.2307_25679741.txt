<plain_text><page sequence="1">Navigating the human-animal divide: marine mammal hunters and rituals of sensory allurement Ian J. McNiven Abstract Hunting as praxis provides an opportunity to investigate how humans and animals meet economically and ontologically. It also provides a window into how societies may ritually construct, manipulate and navigate the human-animal divide as a liminal and permeable boundary. Founded upon the ontological status of prey as kin, marine mammal hunters often establish interpersonal dialogue with prey to aid hunting success. It is usually through the senses that communicative conduits are established so hunters can better know what prey are thinking and cognitively control prey behaviour. Significantly, this dialogue is often mediated ritually by material culture that incorporates prey body parts, particularly sensory organs of the head. This spiritual dimension of marine mammal hunting is explored archaeologically using dugong ear bones found within mounded ritual deposits of dugong bones in Torres Strait, north-east Australia. Ethnographic and archaeological data reveal that ear bones were purposefully extracted from dugong skulls and used as hunting charms to ritually mediate dialogue between hunters and prey. These rituals of sensory allurement provide new avenues for exploring the ontological relationship of ancient hunters to prey.

Introduction Humans have a special relationship with animals that transcends subsistence and technology. This special relationship operates at an ontological and cosmological level and goes to the heart of how we position ourselves in terms of the human-animal divide. Yet '[h]uman cultures rarely employ the simple dualism of human-animal' (Fuentes 2006: 129). Conceptualizing this divide as a liminal and at times fluid and permeable boundary is a defining feature of many hunting societies (i.e. societies that derive most of their meat !3 Routledge World Archaeology Vol. 42(2): 215-230 Humans and Animals \ Tayior^ranciscroup ? 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis ISSN 0043-8243 print/1470-1375 online DOI: 10.1080/00438241003672849</page><page sequence="2">216 Ian J. McNiven through the procurement of large game with the assistance of technology (Ingold 1986: 89)). It is an exercise that attempts to come to terms with perceived similarities and differences between humans and animals. As Guenther remarked, "'same as" and "other than" man, "within" and "without", "kindred" and "alien": such are the fundamental structural oppositions that become both defined and obliterated, mediated and confounded, as mankind contemplates animalkind' (1991: 196). The fact that among the oldest known representations of humans and animals are the c.32,000-year-old lion headed therianthropic figurines from Hohlenstein-Stadel and Hohle Fels in Germany reveals the fundamental importance of conceptualizing the ontological dimensions of the human-animal divide in the development of anatomically modern humans (Wynn et al. 2009). This paper concerns human-animal relationships and how hunters manipulate, mediate and navigate the ontological and cosmological divide where humans and animals 'meet' (see Noske 1997: viii). Ethnographic research reveals that most if not all hunting encounters with large mammals have spiritual and ritual dimensions. Frison points out that, '[w]ithout known exception, ceremonial activity accompanied ethnographic accounts of communal bison hunting' (2004: 92) in North America. For archaeology, neglecting the spiritual and ritual dimensions of hunting practices not only misrepresents essential ontological dimensions of past societies, but more immediately it often ignores key dimensions of the archaeological record. As McNiven and Feldman state, '[t]o assume that a bone deposit has not been affected by ritual activity is to make, somewhat ironically, a major statement about both the ontological status of animals and the spiritual relationships between people and animals in that society' (2003: 189). Only partial characterization of past hunting practices is provided if the focus of study is subsistence, technology and ecology (O'Connor 1996: 12; Stora 2001; Zimmerman Holt 1996). This issue of incompleteness comes into sharp focus for archaeologists who often do not appreciate that the faunal deposits they are investigating may have ritual dimensions that have influenced the form and representation of discarded bones. The most obvious direct way rituals may influence faunal deposits is in selective use of animal bones for rituals (e.g. hunting magic, spiritual renewal) and deposition in special sites (e.g. Reitz and Wing 2008: 279-80). In extreme cases, the primary evidence for hunting of certain animals may be ritual bone deposits (e.g. Aleutian whale hunting (Black 1987: 35)). Documenting ritual bone use is an important goal for archaeology as it provides a more holistic approach to hunting that better represents what past hunters knew was necessary to undertake a successful hunt. Indeed, ritual use of bones from hunted animals provides some of the earliest evidence for human ceremonial activity and religious beliefs. Significantly, much of this evidence concerns animal skulls which carry the main sensory organs of sight (eyes), hearing (ears), smell (nose) and taste (mouth). Examples include Upper Palaeolithic and possibly Middle Palaeolithic bear skulls (Germonpre and Hamalainen 2007), Palaeoindian bison skulls (Frison 2004) and Neolithic dugong skulls (Meryl et al. 2009). However, archaeological understandings of the spiritual and ritual dimensions of hunting practices and associated ritual bone use remain poorly conceptualized and documented. This paper attempts to extend such understandings, focusing on marine mammal hunting. It centres on the contention that a key dimension of marine mammal hunting rituals is ontological positioning of prey as kin and establishment</page><page sequence="3">Navigating the human-animal divide 111 of embodied social and sensory dialogues between hunters and prey. In many cases, this 'killing dialogue' (Bradley 1997: 9) is ritually mediated by material culture that often incorporates animal body parts. Often these body parts are bone and as such are amenable to long-term preservation and archaeological investigation. The potential of this cognitive and contextual approach is illustrated using ethnographically informed archaeological insights about dugong ear bones from mounded ritual deposits of dugong bones dating to the past c.500 years in Torres Strait, north-east Australia. The mounds were created by Torres Strait Islanders, maritime specialists who have hunted dugongs for the past 4000 years (Crouch et al. 2007). Humans animals It is generally considered that domestication heralds human control over the behaviour of animals. In a domesticated relationship, animals become physically restrained (e.g. tethered), psychologically restrained (e.g. selective breeding to remove violent strains) and physically enhanced (e.g. selective breeding to increase meat, milk, etc.) (Clutton-Brock 1994; Ingold 1994). While hunter-gatherers clearly affect the behaviour of wild animals (e.g. animals will usually attempt to run away to avoid being killed by a hunter), a key element of control is combining cumulative observational knowledge of nuances of animal behaviour with skill and technology to effect successful capture of prey (e.g. Mithen 1988). Sensory contact is to be avoided - hide so the prey can't see the hunter, be silent so the prey can't hear the hunter and get downwind so the prey can't smell the hunter. This techno-secular approach to hunter-gatherer hunting is reflected in archaeological research which seeks to understand the process of hunting in the mechanical terms of weaponry (e.g. projectile points) and hunting facilities (e.g. blinds and jump-kill sites). Socialized prey The techno-secular view of hunting is very much a Western construct. Ingold posits that, for hunter-gatherers, animals are not conceived of being 'bent on escape, brought down only by the hunter's superior cunning, speed or forces. To the contrary, a hunt that is successfully consummated with a kill is taken as proof of amicable relations between the hunter and the animal that has willingly allowed itself to be taken' (1994: 12). These amicable relations represent deep social knowledge of animals acquired through the experience of hunting. In this sense, the 'weapons of the hunter' are not 'instruments of control or manipulation' but social relationships through which 'the hunter does not transform the world, rather the world opens itself up to him'. Furthermore, 'the hunter's tools are caught up in chains of personal (not mechanical) causation, serving to reveal the otherwise hidden intentions of non-human agents' (Ingold 1994: 16). Through this process hunters attempt to navigate the ontological and epistemological divide between humans and animals by 'drawing nature into the nexus of social relations, or "humanising" it. This "drawing in" has as its object to establish the conditions not of control but a kind of mutualism' (Ingold 2000: 314). Thus, Ingold (1994) contends, whereas a pastoralist's association with domesticated animals is based on a mechanical relationship of</page><page sequence="4">218 Ian J. McNiven 'domination' through imposed control, a hunter's association with animals is based on a social relationship of 'trust' and what may be referred to as negotiated control. It is in this context that hunters often enter into an interpersonal dialogue with prey such that prey agree either to be killed or at least to be drawn in closer to allow hunters to effect a successful kill. Prey as kin The 'humanizing' of prey and animals more generally, as a dimension of the broader human tendency to anthropomorphize the world (Guthrie 1993; Kennedy 1992), presents an incomplete picture of prey socialization and engagement. Humanizing is part of a broader ontology where the world is imbued with agency and intentionality and what Anderson (2000) eloquently refers to as 'sentient ecology'. In sentient worlds, humans negotiate their relatedness and a fluid ontological proximity to animals through intimate engagements informed by culturally specific cosmogonies and socio-political relationships (e.g. totemism). Such negotiations are also species specific with degrees of relatedness conceptualized and expressed as an interplay of anthromorphic and zoomorphic thinking. In this connection, Morris emphasizes the importance of 'theriomorphic thinking' whereby 'the subsistence hunter invariably develops a sympathetic relationship with the hunted animal' (2000: 21). Anthropomorphic thinking has limitations - 'treating animals as if they were human while out hunting ... would hardly bring practical success' (Morris 2000: 39). A key dimension to hunting success is predicting what prey will do in a range of circumstances (including preys' learned responses to avoiding hunters). Such prediction centres not only on detailed knowledge of animal behaviour gained through intimate observation and experience, but also on appreciating prey as fellow sentient beings and understanding how they think and respond in different situations. In many cases, intimate understanding of prey is part of a broader ontology and cosmogony that sees humans and certain animals as kin. That is, humans and animals cognitively, somatically and spiritually overlap to the point that the human-animal divide is seen as fluid, permeable and mutually intelligible. The degree of permeability is usually situational and negotiable, and open to manipulation through ritual. In extreme cases and contexts, the human-animal divide is transgressed completely as humans transform into animals and animals transform into humans. While such transformations are a feature of shamanic cultures, they are also a feature of totemic societies where the notion of animals as kin is axiomatic (Riboli 2004). The process of hunting illustrates well how people can manipulate the ontological proximity of humans and prey. As Willerslev points out in relation to the Yukaghir, '[t]his ambiguity [between animals and humans] is especially apparent when hunting' (2001: 44). Yukaghir hunters enter a liminal state where the 'liminal condition is associated with a skilful de-humanisation and "empathy" towards an animal Other' (2001: 47). Sensory allurement Hunters establish social relationships and interpersonal dialogue with prey through organs of the head - both the brain and senses (primarily eyes and ears). Neurophysiological</page><page sequence="5">Navigating the human-animal divide 219 research demonstrates that the 'perceptual worlds in both animals and humans are related to the nature of their sensory systems' (Ewert 2005: 40). Indeed, it is 'shared sensory modalities' that form a critical dimension to what Fuentes (2006: 125-6) refers to as the 'shared personhood' between humans and animals. It is through sensory organs that communicative conduits are established and enabled so hunters can better know not only what prey are thinking but also cognitively control and cajole prey behaviour. As Daston and Mitman cogently note, '[t]hinking with animals is not the same as thinking about them' (2005: 5). Within the realms of sentient ecology and prey as kin, the capacity for such dialogue is perfectly natural. In many instances, cognitive and sensory dialogue was enhanced and mediated ritually through material culture. Obvious examples include hunting charms carved from wood, stone and bone (e.g. Fraser 1976 [1911]). However, another ritual category of mediating material culture concerns remains of prey, particular sensory organs, as a dimension of the permeability and intersubjectivity of the human animal divide. The remainder of this paper explores the potential significance of these body part charms for archaeological investigation in the context of marine mammal hunting. Marine mammal hunting: ritual allurement and sensory control Indigenous marine mammal hunting primarily concerns Cetaceans (whales and dolphins), Pinnipeds (seals and walruses) and Sirenians (dugongs and manatees) (Marsh et al. 2002; McKillop 1985; Monks 2005; Takekawa 1996). In most instances where detailed ethnographic studies have been undertaken, the procurement of large marine mammals by indigenous hunters is enmeshed in cosmological significance and meaning and saturated with ritual performances (e.g. Watanabe 1994). Such enmeshments also reflect an ontological view of the sea as a sentient realm and the concept of 'seascapes as spiritscapes' (McNiven 2003, 2008). Ingold's contention that in many hunting societies animals are seen to present themselves voluntarily to hunters as prey is indeed a feature of many high-latitude marine mammal hunting societies (e.g. Fienup-Riordan 1990a; Sabo and Sabo 1985; Taylor 1985; Turner 1990; see also Paulson 1968). Often the social relationship and responsibility of 'trust' and 'reciprocity' includes the special treatment of prey remains, especially skulls, to ensure spiritual renewal - e.g. whales (Rainey 1947), seals (Fienup-Riordan 1990b; Lantis 1947) and dugongs (Hobson et al. 2009). In other cases, hunter-prey interaction is ritually mediated by material culture (e.g. hunting charms) made from sensory organs of prey. For example, the Chukchi of Siberia used whales' eyes as whale hunting charms. According to Bogoras, '[t]he pupils of the eyes are wrapped in leather and then joined together in pairs, and added to the string of amulets belonging to the boat' (1907: 408). Soft-tissue hunting charms usually have little potential for archaeological preservation. However, evidence is accumulating from some parts of the world that special treatment was also given to whale, manatee and dugong ear bones to aid sensory communication between hunters and prey to help bring hunter and prey together and increase hunting success. For example, Turner (1990) discusses the complex rituals and associated taboos associated with whale hunting she experienced among the Point Hope Alaskan Inuit.</page><page sequence="6">220 Ian McNiven Many ritual preparations include (spiritual) communication with whales and ensuring proper conduct, as whales can 'hear' people. It was in this context during butchering of a whale that 'Ernie showed me the ear with its six-inch tympanum on one side, soft and sensitive like an inverted baby's cheek, and on the other, a hard polished conch. He wanted me to see it because this is what had been listening to us. Ernie's manner was quiet, his face a combination of smile and dead pan' (Turner 1990: 48). Possible archaeological correlates for special treatment of whale ear bones are available for the Nuu'chah'nulth and neighbouring Makah of the Vancouver Island region. For the Nuu'chah'nulth, '[wjhaling was one of the most supernaturally charged activities and required the most elaborate ritual preparation' (McMillan 2000: 160). Rituals included increasing the permeability of the whale-human divide with chiefs 'mimicking the behaviour' of whales and the wife of the harpooner 'would actually become the whale' such that if she remained still so too would the whale (Jonaitis 1999: 8-9). In terms of sensory organ rituals, removal of eyes from a stolen new-born baby would make a seal or whale 'blind' to the approach of hunters (Jonaitis 1999: 200). Archaeological excavation of the Ozette site within Makah territory revealed twenty-two extracted and modified 'auditory bullae' (ear bones) from humpback and gray whales dating mostly to within the past 400 years. Use-wear along fractured edges of ear bones is consistent with a scraping function but for what purpose remains unknown (Fisken 1994: 375; see also Monks 2001: 144). The Rama of eastern Nicaragua hunt manatees from canoes using harpoons. Rama hunters 'refrain from talking about the location of the manatee while hunting it, or even about hunting charms they carry, because they believe that with its acute sense of hearing the manatee is sure to know what is going on. In this way it is like a human being' (Loveland 1976: 76). Hunting success involves avoiding sensory perception by the manatee. 'For this reason the Rama utilize as "magic" the earbone of the manatee to keep the creature from hearing them' (Loveland 1976: 74). The ear bones are specially extracted from the manatee skull and are presented to the harpooner (Loveland 1975: 75). More generally, Barrett notes that the 'cylindrical stapes of the inner ear [of manatees] are saved by the Nicaraguans as charms against ill-luck' (1935: 218). Manatees were consumed by the Maya, and manatee ear bones forming part of a 'votive cache on the summit of a pyramid at San Jose' in Belize have been associated with 'magical protection' and 'hearing' (Thompson 1939: 185, 1994: 130). Along coastal South Australia, certain Aboriginal men of the Whale totem possessed the power and 'magic' to ritually 'sing' whales ashore at their totemic 'home Kondilindjarung (place of whales)' where the stranded carcasses were subsequently butchered and eaten (Berndt and Berndt 1993: 81; Clarke 2001). For members of the Whale totem/clan, 'the spirit of the whale and their own spirits were inseparable', with whales their ancestor and 'human in the creative era' (Berndt and Berndt 1993: 81). While no ethnographic information is available on associated whale hunting charms, a modified 'whale ear bone' with 'part of its surface ... scraped flat' was collected from a coastal archaeological site near Kondilindjarung in the 1940s/1950s (Clarke 2001: 22). Significantly, neither archaeological nor ethnographic evidence is available to indicate Aboriginal Australians traditionally hunted whales using boats and harpoons (Clarke 2001: 22). However, stranding by 'singing' raises the question as to whether or not this ritual activity could be considered a form of hunting using spiritual technology as</page><page sequence="7">Navigating the human-animal divide 221 Aboriginal people believed the whales were immobilized and killed through human agency. Torres Strait dugong hunters: rituals of sensory allurement Dugongs (Dugong dugon) are herbivorous marine mammals inhabiting shallow tropical and sub-tropical latitudes from east Africa to the western Pacific. They grow to about 3 4m and average around 200-300kg. For Torres Strait Islanders dugong hunting is associated with complex ceremonialism and intimate ritual performances. Haddon reported that the 'two most important food animals of the Torres Straits islanders were the dugong and turtle, and it was only natural that there should have been elaborate ceremonial in connection with them' (1935: 355). Both dugong and turtle are major totems for Torres Strait Islanders (Haddon 1904). A broad range of rituals and charms are used by Torres Strait Islanders to attract dugongs to hunters (see McNiven and Feldman 2003 for a detailed overview). Charms were carved from wood and stone, and are also made from dugong body parts (bone and soft tissue). It is body part charms that concern this paper. Ethnography (body part charms) Haddon recorded charms made from the 'nose and anterior part of the face of a dead dugong' and the 'larynx and trachea stuffed' with a range of plant products (including sea grass) so 'dugong he smell him, he come quick' (1904: 338). More recently, Raven noted that 'dugong skulls were stuffed with plants and used' (1990: 140) as hunting charms. Next to a stone charm shaped like a dugong on Boigu island were placed sea grass (dugong food), dugong bones (arranged in their 'correct order') and a post from which hangs a damab (dugong's trachea stuffed with flowers). The operator can then 'call up' dugongs out to sea by whispering into the ear of the stone dugong, orienting the stone dugong in certain ways, and taking the damab out to sea to 'waft the dugong towards the hunter' (Lawrie 1970: 236-7). From Mua island, senior elder Fr John Manas reported that a 'small bag of [raw] dugong meat' can be placed in the front and back of a dinghy to 'make the boat go straight to the dugong. The meat steered the dinghy straight to the dugong' (Manas et al. 2008: 396). In recent times, both the 'brain' and 'throat pipe' (trachea) of dugongs were cooked and eaten to assist with dugong hunting (Manas et al. 2008: 390-1). The consumption of these organs provides hunters with special knowledge: 'you know where they're feeding, and you go there'. More specifically, '[t]hat thing leads you. That throat pipe makes you see where the dugongs are, it leads you there, it calls you to there where they are. That throat pipe is a road, when you eat it you know that road. That throat pipe is yabu [road], it's the path taken by the dugong'. In the 1970s, Nietschmann was informed by Torres Strait Islanders that dugongs 'don't have good eyes like turtle. They travel with the aingaizinga. They know from that compass' (1977: 9). The aingaizinga is the oesophagus of a dugong and sometimes hunters will extract and eat 'a few bits' of it, hoping to 'ingest the power of the dugong compass'.</page><page sequence="8">222 Ian J. McNiven Thus, in Torres Strait, hunting charms in the form of dugong body parts gave hunters sensory access to the cognitive agency of dugongs through an ontology of shared and permeable personhood (see Fowler 2004). In this ritually orchestrated engagement, an interpersonal cognitive and sensory consubstantiation was established and enabled that directed hunters towards dugongs and dugongs towards hunters. As the ontological boundary between humans and dugongs was momentarily blurred, ambiguous and delicately balanced during these ritual encounters, it is possible that the human identity and personhood of hunters was seen to be in an ontologically unstable and liminal state. To help manage this instability, hunters often attempted to maintain spiritual purity through complex behavioural taboos that were also adhered to by community members during dugong hunting events (Haddon 1904: 182). Torres Strait Islanders speak of the temporary 'transformation of people into animals', and legendary stories recount persons with dugong bodies (Haddon 1904: 354, 1935: 103). With the local totemic system, a 'definite physical and psychological resemblance was thus postulated for the human and animal members of the clan' (Haddon 1904: 184). In this sense the concept of personhood among Torres Strait Islanders not only transcended humans and included animals, but also was transformative. Archaeology (ear-bone charms) No archaeological evidence for dugong hunting charms made from wood or soft-tissue body parts has been recorded from the tropical environment of Torres Strait. The lack of recorded wood and soft-tissue charms reflects poor preservation conditions resulting from the moist, tropical climate of the region. However, archaeological excavations of dugong bone mounds over the past decade have revealed dugong ear bones (tympano-periotic complex) that appear to have been specially extracted and used as a previously unrecorded form of dugong hunting charm. Dugong bone mounds have been recorded across the western and central islands of Torres Strait and radiocarbon dating indicates construction from around 400-500 years ago to the early twentieth century (McNiven and Bedingfield 2008; McNiven and Feldman 2003; Skelly et al. in press). The hypothesis that dugong ear bones were charms associated with dugong hunting magic was advanced originally by McNiven and Feldman (2003) based primarily on excavated dugong bone mounds on the islands of Pulu and Tudu (located 90km apart). This hypothesis, formulated using a range of data, has been further supported by additional archaeological and ethnographic information obtained over the past five years. A summary of original and new supporting evidence includes: 1 Dugong bone mounds are a highly specialized ceremonial site type. Numerous ethnographic and ethnohistorical sources from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries associate dugong bones, especially skulls, with dugong hunting magic sites (see McNiven and Feldman 2003 for details). Haddon (1912: 131) noted that dugong skulls and bones were 'massed in heaps ... for ceremonial purposes'. Archaeological analysis of dugong bone mounds indicates selective deposition of crania (whole and fragmented) and ribs, elements that comprise c. 60 per cent (by weight) of a dugong skeleton (Skelly et al. in press) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, both the</page><page sequence="9">Navigating the human-animal divide 223 Tudu and Pulu bone mounds are strategically located immediately inland of the shoreline overlooking the sea and rich dugong hunting areas (McNiven and Feldman 2003). Recent analysis of dugong bone mounds on the islands of Koey Ngurtai and Mabuyag confirms this pattern of shoreline location (Skelly et al. in press; McNiven and Bedingfield 2008) (Plate 1). 2 Ear hones purposefully extracted from skull. Ear bones are usually found deliberately extracted from skulls and are over represented in terms of skeletal elements (McNiven and Feldman 2003) (Plate 2). Such preferential treatment is consistent with special use. Dugong ear bones are embedded securely within the skull between the robust temporal and occipital bones and can only be extracted by the application of considerable mechanical force (Plate 2). Less than 10 per cent of ear bones excavated from Dabangai Bone Mound on Mabuyag are within skulls, suggesting nearly all ear bones within the site had been purposefully detached prior to deposition (McNiven and Bedingfield 2008). The purposeful extraction of dugong ear bones has been further confirmed by detailed analysis of dugong skull bone element fragmentation patterns at three dugong bone mounds on Koey Ngurtai (see Skelly et al. in press for details). In particular, k[u]nusually high levels of fragmentation among temporal and squamosal bones show that ear bones were Figure J Dugong skeleton and body outline.

Matching pairs of left and right ear bones have been documented adjacent to dugong crania within different levels of bone mounds on Mabuyag (McNiven and Bedingfield 2008) and 37km to the south west on the island of Zurath (Joe Crouch pers. comm.). In most cases, the paired ear bones are located adjacent to either the rear end of a dugong cranium or a similarly arranged pair of rear cranium (occipital) bones (Plate 3). 4 Ethnographic information on acute hearing of dugongs. Torres Strait hunters know very well of the acute hearing of dugongs and that hunting success is contingent in part upon limiting noise to avoid frightening dugongs away (McNiven and Feldman</page><page sequence="11">Navigating the human-animal divide 225 Plate 3 Pair of dugong ear bones (lower left) carefully arranged near the rear half of a dugong skull, Dabangai Bone Mound, Mabuyag, Torres Strait. Excavated December 2004. (Photo: Ian McNiven.) 2003). Recently, Fr Manas of Mua reinforced the importance of dugong hearing and ears in dugong hunting: '[d]ugong can hear from long way or near. This ear tell the dugong. And he is smart, and when you go near, it's something like, something without any touch and then dugong disappear' (Manas et al. 2008: 392). Although dugongs are equally known for their poor eyesight, Fr Manas continues that 'this one here has eye' in the form of ears. In terms of dugong hearing and ears: '[i]t's very, it's something like, smart' (Manas et al. 2008: 392). 5 Ethnographic evidence for use of ear bones to mediate communication with dugongs. Subsequent to excavations on Pulu and Tudu, local elders revealed that dugong ear bones were referred to as 'radar bones' and 'wireless bones' and were used to assist communication with dugongs to aid hunting by bringing dugongs closer to hunters (McNiven and Feldman 2003). Archaeological and ethnographic evidence confirms ritual use of dugong ear bones as hunting charms by Torres Strait dugong hunters. Significantly, indigenous hunters of the dugongs' cousin, the manatee of Central America, also use manatee ear bones to ritually control manatees, in this case suppressing the prey's hearing sense to avoid detection of hunters (see above). Thus, while ear bones in both regions were used to ritually control Serenian hearing, in Torres Strait control entailed enhancing auditory communion between hunters and prey while in Central America control entailed suppressing auditory contact and communication. Both approaches, encompassing polar extremes of ritually mediated dialogues between hunters and prey, illustrate the overarching communicative nature of hunting magic. For both dugongs and manatees, interpersonal dialogue between hunters and prey is founded upon an ontology of prey as kin and shared and permeable personhood ritually</page><page sequence="12">226 Ian J. McNiven enhanced for the hunt and mediated by material culture. In such ritual encounters, the human-animal divide becomes ever-more ambiguous, blurred and permeable. This blending and sharing is illustrated nicely by the Yanyuwa of northern Australia for whom dugongs are considered 'relatives' and 'kin' through 'shared genesis' (Bradley 1998: 134): In past times the hunters of dugong, in particular, would take the small leaves from any species of melaleuca, blow heavily on them in imitation of the exhaling breath of dugong, put their underarm sweat on them and then put them in their ears. This was said to make the dugong deaf to the hunter's movements_Other hunters would pour water into their ears, and as with the melaleuca leaves, it was considered to make the dugong deaf, and at the same time make the hunter much more alert. (Bradley 1997: 325-6) Conclusion Ever since the first hunting encounters with prey over one million years ago, humans have negotiated a special relationship with animals. To understand how different societies construct and navigate the animal-human divide we need to investigate how human and animals actively meet - both economically and ontologically (see also Shanklin 1985). Yet as archaeologists we struggle to find ways of understanding how ancient humans negotiated hunter-prey relationships beyond the economics of subsistence and technology. Ethnographic information on hunting societies reveals that the ontological status of the human-animal divide is not fixed but flexible, situational and open to manipulation. Hunting often involves ritual practices that not only increase the ontological proximity and permeability of the boundary between hunters and prey, but also provide the means for navigating the human-animal divide. This ontological divide is based on what Guenther refers to as the 'two ontological qualities' of animals, viz. 'perceived as simultaneously "other than" and "same as" man' (1991: 200). In terms of hunting, keeping this duality 'in balance' allows a certain detachment to accommodate the killing and consumption of prey while also allowing a certain attachment to accommodate empathy and communion with prey (Guenther 1991: 198; Willerslev 2001: 45). As Willerslev notes, 'it is this duality of perspectives that makes the hunter so deadly' (2007: 190). Navigating this divide usually entailed interpersonal dialogue between hunters and prey founded upon an understanding of mutual sentience, cognitive kinship and shared personhood, and the capacity of humans to communicate with animals through the senses. As navigation was across an ontological divide and liminal space, communication entailed the spiritual realm and ritual performances. In this context, hunting rituals, as material, behavioural and conceptual dimensions of the human-animal divide, provide a window into the ontological status and ritually negotiated proximity of humans and animals. Ethnographic information on marine mammal hunters reveals that communication with prey was mediated ritually using material culture that often included prey body parts related to sensory organs of the head. This performative and material dimension of hunting rituals provides archaeologists with an opportunity to explore the human-animal</page><page sequence="13">Navigating the human-animal divide 227 divide in various cultural contexts. This paper demonstrates this potential using dugong ear bones from Torres Strait. Both ethnographic and archaeological evidence confirm the special ritual treatment of dugong ear bones by Torres Strait Islanders. The ear bones reveal a cognitive kinship between hunters and dugongs and that animal-human interpersonal dialogue was considered possible through embodied rituals of the senses. Such embodiment was part of a broader tradition of dugong hunting rituals using dugong body parts employed by Melanesian peoples of the Torres Strait region and adjacent Aboriginal peoples of north-east Australia. The fact that ear bones, both within skulls and, perhaps more pointedly, extracted, were incorporated carefully into elaborate dugong bone mound structures indicates their ongoing agency as objects of power and respect. Such treatment reveals the ontological proximity of Torres Strait Islanders and dugongs and the cosmological necessity of ritually negotiating the intimate spiritual, social and sensual relationship between hunters and prey. At death, the ontological proximity of hunters and prey narrowed further as Torres Strait Islanders on their death beds are known to move their bodies in resemblance to their totems as a final mortal act. That the relationship between hunter and prey did not stop at death is attested to by the graves of dugong hunters adorned with dugong skulls and ribs (Haddon 1935: 65, 74; Rigsby and Chase 1998: 207; Thomson 1934: 254, Plate 31.2). These graves point to an ongoing relationship where the human-animal divide dissolved as the post-mortem bodies and shared personhoods of hunter and prey finally merged as one. Acknowledgements This paper owes much to the many Torres Strait Islander dugong hunters who have shared with me their views on the meaning and importance of dugong hunting. Conceptual development of this paper was enhanced greatly by generous comments provided by John Bradley. I also thank Bruno David, Joe Crouch and Jeremy Ash for helpful comments on the paper. For information on Australian Aboriginal whaling I thank Philip Clarke and Lynette Russell.
