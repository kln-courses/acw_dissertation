<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PROPOSAL FOR ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS Fred W. Peel* I. INTRODUCTION This article develops in detail a proposal for eliminating double taxation of corporate dividends by excluding dividends frojn gross income at the individual shareholder level if the dividends are paid from income previously taxed at the corporate level.1 In brief, the proposal is to adopt a single corporate income tax rate equal to the maximum individual tax rate and permit shareholders to exclude from income dividends paid out of corporate earnings that have been taxed at the single corporate rate. It is submitted that the proposal would advance tax simplification, while taxing corporate profits on a more rational basis. The past decade has seen wide discussion of methods integrating the corporate and individual income taxes?either completely or partially.2 Full integration would treat corporate income as though it had been earned initially by the shareholders as individuals.3 Partial integration plans are designed to achieve that result for all or part of the dividends distributee! to individual shareholders, either by crediting the shareholders with the corporate tax or by allowing cor porations to deduct all or part of their dividends.4 Exclusion of dividends from the income of individual shareholders heretofore has generally been dismissed out-of-hand.5 There appear to have been three reasons for the lack of interest in the dividend exclusion approach. First, until the maximum individual tax rate on investment income was reduced to 50%,6 the wide disparity between the corporate tax rate and the higher individual rates would have meant that exclusion of dividends would discriminate unacceptably in favor of corporate income. With a maximum individual tax rate of 50%, however, the gap has been narrowed significantly. Now it is feasible to suggest *Fred W. Peel (B.A., Harvard College, 1939; J.D., Harvard Law School, 1942) is a Professor of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and is a member of the Arkansas and District of Columbia Bars. 'This proposal was put forward in summary form in Peel, An Approach to Income Tax Simpli fication, 1 U. Ark. Little Rock L.J. 1, 25 (1978). In 1984, twenty law professors, economists, and tax lawyers who previously had studied the double tax issue were kind enough to read and criticize a draft of the detailed proposal made in this article. I am deeply indebted to them for their helpful comments. I do not recognize them here by name, however, as that might falsely imply that they all endorse the proposal. 2See, e.g., Report on the Integration of Corporate and Individual Income Taxes, 31 Tax Lawyer 37 (1977). 3Id. at 38. 4The latter plan is proposed in U.S. Deft of the Treasury, Tax Reform for Fairness, Simplicity, and Economic Growth 118-19, 132-38 (Nov. 1984) [hereinafter cited as Treasury Report]. 5See, e.g., C.

Regardless of the adjustment, the proposed dividend exclusion requires a non progressive corporate tax rate that equals the maximum individual rate. Second, because some dividends, defined in terms of earnings and profits,7 may not have been taxed at the corporate level, exclusion of all dividends would permit some corporate income to escape tax altogether. The proposal here will exclude dividends at the individual shareholder level only when distributed from previously taxed income, and only from income earned by the corporation after the proposal has been put into effect. Third, there has been widespread confusion between two different policy objectives?integration of corporate and shareholder taxes, on the one hand, and elimination of double taxation of dividends, on the other hand. Although their consequences overlap to some degree, the objectives of integration and of elimination of double taxation differ sharply. For example, full integration, by treating corporate income as though earned directly by the shareholders, would not merely eliminate the double tax but also all tax when the shareholder is an exempt organization8 (unless the tax is reimposed on exempt organizations as a corollary to the tax on unrelated business income,9 or as an extension of the tax now imposed on investment income of some exempt organizations, such as social clubs10). In essence, integration assumes that the corporation is not an appropriate taxpayer and that its role should be, at most, that of a tax withholding agent for its shareholders. In contrast, eliminating double taxation of dividends treats the corporation as a viable and appropriate taxpayer. After the corporate tax has been imposed, however, no further tax should be imposed on the same income when, diminished by the corporate tax, it is distributed to the shareholders. II. THE OBJECTIONS TO DOUBLE TAXATION Put simply, the double tax on corporate dividends is unfair. It violates the principle of horizontal equity. A shareholder who is taxed on a dividend out of earnings that already have been taxed at the corporate level is bearing a heavier tax burden than an individual in the same tax bracket receiving equivalent income through an S corporation, through a partnership, or directly as a sole proprietor. It is true that in some circumstances the C corporation shareholder may be treated better than his counterparts, at least when the income is initially earned. This occurs when the corporation's earnings are not distributed as dividends and the tax paid at the corporate level is at a lower rate than the shareholder would pay if he or she had received the income directly. For this reason, the present system has been described as biased in favor of retained corporate earn 7I.R.C. ? 316. %See Staff of the Joint Comm. on Taxation, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., Tax Policy and Capital Formation 12 (Jt.

Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="3">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 3 ings.11 This bias has been reduced by the 50% maximum individual rate, and would be eliminated altogether under the proposal by taxing corporate income in full at the maximum individual rate. In addition to its unfairness, the incidence of the double tax is inconsistent because of the escape routes open to some shareholders in lieu of receiving taxable dividends.12 For example, the second tax can be cut by 60% by selling the stock at a capital gain equivalent to the accumulated corporate earnings.13 The same result can be achieved by liquidating the corporation14 or by stock redemptions within the bounds of section 302(b). Some publicly held corpora tions have combined tender offers for, or market purchases of, their own stock with a policy of declaring little or no cash dividends.15 In addition, if a share holder holds stock in a corporation until his death and the value of the stock reflects the accumulated earnings, the basis of the stock will be stepped up by the amount of the accumulated earnings16 so that the stock can be sold or redeemed by the heirs without any second tax on earnings accumulated during the decedent's ownership. Individual shareholders of publicly held corporations can sell their stock and attempt to realize a capital gain equivalent to their share of the accumulated earnings. If, however, the stock is sold to other individuals who are no better positioned to extract the accumulated earnings without dividend tax, the stock price will be discounted by the potential of an eventual dividend tax. Individual investors who hold stock in publicly held corporations and have chosen dividend-paying stocks in order to have current income are the principal victims of the double tax. There is no compelling policy reason for penalizing these people as a class. The dividend tax, therefore, seriously distorts the pricing mechanism for stock in publicly held corporations. In essence, there are at least two markets for the stock, with widely divergent prices. One market is made up of individual inves tors, who must discount the value of the dividend income stream by the individual income tax they will have to pay. The second market is comprised of corporations that, at most, must discount the value of the dividend income stream by a tax on only 15%.17 (Exempt organizations, such as pension trusts, might be con sidered as composing another market.) If a corporate buyer acquires 80% or more of the stock of a target corporation, it may elect a 100% dividends-received deduction on distributions of future earnings of the target.18 Alternatively, the acquiring corporation may file a consolidated return with the target, eliminating all dividends from it,19 or liq uSee, e.g., ALI, Federal Income Tax Project?Subchapter C, Proposals on Corporate Acquisitions and Dispositions 360 (1982) [hereinafter cited as Tax Project]. i2See, e.g., I.R.C. ? 162(a) (allowing deduction of salary payments). 13I.R.C. ? 1202(a). 14I.R.C. ? 331(a). ,5For example, Teledyne, Incorporated, a corporation that does not pay dividends, repurchased 8.66 million shares of its own common stock for $200 a share under a June 1984 tender offer. 16I.R.C. ? 1014(a). 17I.R.C. ? 243(a)(1). 18I.R.C. ? 243(a)(3), (b). 19Regs. ? 1.1502-14(a)(l).

The corporate buyer can recover the cost of stock of a target corporation tax free through dividends paid by the target corporation out of the latter's earnings,20 whereas an individual buying and holding stock must recover his or her invest ment out of after-tax dollars from dividends. A takeover bid by another cor poration lifts the stock out of the low-priced market of individual investors who must pay tax on their dividends and places it in the market of corporate buyers who can recover the price of the shares out of tax free dividends. For this reason, among others, we have the phenomenon of sudden increases in the price of stocks when corporations become takeover candidates. This possibility, in turn, encourages investors to seek out corporations that are likely to become takeover candidates. The double tax clearly discourages dividends by publicly held corporations. From the point of view of corporate management, retained earnings are available for reinvestment in the business after bearing only one tax. Distributed earnings, however, are diminished by the second tax at the shareholder level. Conse quently, even if distributions are put back in the distributing corporation, the amount available for reinvestment is much smaller/Many shareholders invest willingly in publicly held corporations that pay few or no dividends, preferring to gamble that retained earnings will increase the value of the stock. By deferring tax until sale, they can realize capital gains at lower rates rather than incurring an immediate tax on dividends at ordinary income rates. This confers upon corporate management the power to direct investment of corporate earnings, rather than allowing shareholders to exercise that power through reinvestment of dividends. The additional corporate tax on unreasonable accumulations is designed to curb corporate retention of earnings and to force dividend payments.21 It applies only to accumulations that cannot be justified by the needs of a new or existing business, however, and in any event a business corporation may accumulate $250,000 without penalty.22 In the vast majority of cases, a business use can be found for accumulated earnings. The postponement or eventual avoidance of the double tax, however, is as real and advantageous for the shareholder of a cor poration that accumulates earnings without a business use. Meanwhile, the Ser vice is saddled with the tremendous administrative job of finding and penalizing the corporations that cannot adequately excuse their accumulations. Although in the past the tax on unreasonable accumulations was applied only to closely held corporations,23 it may now apply to publicly held corporations as well.24 20See Cromwell Corp. v. Commissioner, 43 T.C. 313 (1964) (acquiring corporation eligible to file consolidated return with acquired corporation and to eliminate dividend paid by acquired cor poration to acquiring corporation from borrowed funds). 21S&lt;?eI.R.C. ? 531. 22I.R.C. ? 535(c)(2)(A). 23See, e.g., Golconda Mining Corp. v.

Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="5">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 5 The double tax on dividends also distorts the corporate choice between debt and equity financing. Because interest on debt is deductible,25 corporate earnings applied to payment for the use of borrowed capital are taxed only once?to the lender. Debt and equity capital are by no means interchangeable when the debt is owed to persons other than shareholders, so the choice in that case between the two types of financing is not based merely on tax considerations. Moreover, the tax differential can be minimized by not paying out dividends. Nonetheless, for a corporation that must pay dividends for use of its equity capital, the double tax on dividends favors raising capital by borrowing. It might be thought that the bias would remain under the proposal because dividends still will not be deductible by the corporation. If there is a sufficiently close identity between corporate management and shareholders, however, ex clusion by the shareholder is as good as deduction by the corporation. Even in the absence of identity between management and ownership, the cost of equity capital will be reduced as a result of the dividend exclusion, balancing the ability to deduct interest paid on indebtedness. In addition to distortion of the debt-equity ratio for corporations borrowing from persons other than their shareholders, the present tax treatment of corporate debt and equity has created an apparently insuperable problem of distinguishing between debt and equity owned by the same persons. It is advantageous for shareholders in closely held corporations to hold as much of their investment as possible in the form of debt to avoid double tax on payments for the use of the capital and to permit additional withdrawals to be characterized as repayment of debt. Short of treating all debt owed to controlling shareholders as equity, there does not seem to be any workable (or logical) standard that can be applied to distinguish shareholder-owned debt from equity. Congress' attempt in 1969 to delegate authority to draw the line by regulation so far has failed.26 The problem appears to be unavoidable so long as interest is taxed once and earnings paid out as dividends are taxed twice. III. HISTORY OF ATTEMPTS TO RELIEVE DOUBLE TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS When the individual income tax was enacted in 1913, dividends were treated for normal tax purposes in substantially the same way as my proposal would treat them for the full income tax. The normal tax rate on both individuals and corporations was 1%, and dividends were not included in the normal tax base for individual shareholders. An "additional tax" at progressive rates ranging up to 6% was also imposed on individuals with taxable income in excess of $20,000, and dividends were included in the base.27 The corporate tax rate and the in 25I.R.C. ? 163. 26The Treasury Department has so far been unsuccessful under section 385, added by section 415(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, Pub.

Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="6">6 SECTION OF TAXATION dividual normal tax rate generally corresponded until 1919, when the corporate tax was raised above the normal tax on individuals.28 Finally, in 1936, dividends were included in the base for the normal tax as well,29 eliminating even partial relief from double tax. No further relief was provided for dividends until 1954.30 In 1936, Congress gave special recognition to dividends at the corporate level by imposing an undistributed profits tax on corporations.31 The tax on undistrib uted profits, initially imposed at rates ranging from 7% to 27%, was framed as an addition to the tax of 8% to 15% imposed on corporate net income before deducting dividends.32 This split-rate system survived only through 1937.33 The 1954 Internal Revenue Code contained two provisions intended to give individual shareholders partial relief from double tax. One allowed dividend recipients a nonrefundable credit against tax equal to 4% of dividends received.34 No provision was made for grossing up the dividends to include the corporate tax that presumably justified the credit. Indeed, the credit was available even if the dividend was a distribution from earnings and profits that had not been taxed at the corporate level. This credit was widely criticized and Congress eventually reduced it to 2% for 1964 and repealed it for later years.35 The other 1954 Code provision allowed an exclusion of up to $50 of divi dends.36 The $50 exclusion rose to $100 for years after 1964 when the credit against tax was phased out.37 After subsequent changes, the exclusion is now $100 ($200 on joint returns).38 Although this flat exclusion is estimated to reduce revenues in fiscal 1986 by $525 million,39 the benefit for one taxpayer is so small that its effect is insignificant. IV. RECENT PROPOSALS In January 1977 a Treasury Study, "Blueprints for Basic Tax Reform," was published by the Ford Administration.40 One alternative in this study proposed a model tax based on income, providing for full integration of corporate and individual taxes by allocating all corporate income, whether distributed or not, 28Revenue Act of 1918, ch. 18, ? 320(a)(2), 40 Stat. 1057. 29Revenue Act of 1936, ch. 690, ? 22(a), 49 Stat. 1648. 30I.R.C. ?? 34, 116 (1954). 3,Revenue Act of 1936, ch. 690, ? 14, 49 Stat. 1648. nld.

The Treasury "Blueprints" were not advanced as a specific set of Administration proposals, but rather as a guide for future legis lation. Later in 1977 the incoming Carter Administration developed a plan for partial dividend relief.41 This plan would have allocated part of the tax of each corporate taxpayer to a refundable income tax account that would be treated as tax withheld from dividends so that individual shareholders could credit the withheld amount against their tax liability attributable to the dividends.42 The plan was not rec ommended to Congress, the Carter Administration opting instead for a reduction in the corporate tax rate. When the Carter tax program was under consideration, Congressman Ullman, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, put forward two versions of a similar plan. The Ullman plan called for a refundable shareholder credit against individual tax, starting in the first year at 10% of dividends received and increasing eventually to 20%. Shareholders would be required to gross up their dividends by the amount of the credit. Generally, the full amount of the credit would not be permitted unless a specified percentage of actual United States corporate tax equalled the grossed-up dividend amount.43 The reaction of the corporations to the Ullman plan ranged from lukewarm support to outright op position.44 The Ullman plan was never adopted in any legislation. In 1982, Professor William Andrews, in the Reporter's Study appended to the American Law Institute's "Proposals on Corporate Acquisitions and Dis position," suggested allowing corporations a deduction for dividends paid on newly contributed capital. The deduction would be limited to a specified rate approximating the yield on high-grade corporate bonds, and the deduction would be allowed only for a specified number of years after the new capital was contributed.45 The Treasury Report in November 1984 also proposed a dividend deduction plan.46 The proposal was to provide relief from double taxation of dividends by allowing the dividend-paying corporation to deduct half the amount of the div idends paid from income that had been subject to corporate tax. Concurrently, the $100 dividends-received exclusion would be repealed. Both proposals were included in President Reagan's 1985 Tax Proposals, but the proposed dividends paid deduction was cut from 50% to 10%.47 AlSee C.

Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="8">8 SECTION OF TAXATION V. INCIDENCE OF THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX It is necessary to examine whether a corporation shifts the burden of its income tax to its customers or employees. Most analyses of the incidence of the corporate income tax focus on the publicly held, rather than the closely held corporation. This article will analyze both, beginning with the closely held corporation. Suppose a town has five dry cleaning establishments, all operated as sole proprietorships, all charging about the same for their services, and all earning comparable before-tax profits. Suppose further that one of them incorporates, setting up a single shareholder corporation to operate the dry cleaning business. Unless the salary paid to the sole shareholder is equal to the business' total profit, the corporation will have taxable income and pay corporate tax and its owner will have less income and pay a smaller individual income tax than if the business had continued to receive all profits directly as a sole proprietorship. Clearly, this shift to corporate form will not shift the corporation's share of the total income tax burden to its customers. The services performed are identical to those performed previously and to those performed by the competitors still operating as sole proprietorships. Organizing the corporation would not allow the business to raise prices to its customers or to lower wages to its workers. Therefore, it (and indirectly its sole shareholder) bears the entire incidence of the corporate tax. Any price increase that would yield a higher profit before tax than previously could be accomplished without incorporating. Interposing the corporate form would not affect the before-tax level of profit from the business. Incorporating is likely to reduce the total tax burden on the dry cleaning business because the income can thereafter be split between two taxpayers, the corporation and the salary-drawing shareholder, both subject to progressive tax rates. Indeed, if that were not the case, the cleaner would probably not incorporate in the first place. Surely, incorporating with resulting lower aggregate income taxes cannot shift the incidence of the tax to the customers (or to the workers). The closely held corporation is the alter ego of its owner or owners, and it is no more able to shift the tax burden than a sole proprietorship. The publicly held corporation is not the alter ego of its shareholders.48 Even when managed for the benefit of shareholders as a group, the consequences may be contrary to the interests of some shareholders. Also, management has some incentive to make business decisions contrary to the best interests of shareholders. This does not establish, however, that publicly held corporations are any better equipped to shift the incidence of the corporate tax to consumers or labor. Economists have been unable to agree on the incidence of the income tax paid by publicly held corporations.49 It appears, however, that those who argue that the corporate tax cannot be shifted have the better of the argument. In a free market, both corporate and noncorporate entrepreneurs will strive 48A. Berle &amp; G. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1st ed. 1932, rev. ed. 1968). 49See, e.g., J. Pechman, Federal Tax Policy 129-35 (3d ed. 1977). Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="9">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 9 to maximize pre-tax profit. This objective will not be influenced by fluctua tions in income tax rates. (The public utilities whose rates are set by regulatory bodies that treat the income tax as an expense are a special case and are discussed infra.) The business practice of using a designated after-tax rate of return as a cutoff point in making investment decisions does not undercut the foregoing conclusion. This is merely a convenient yardstick. For example, suppose a corporation is subject to a 50% marginal income tax rate50 and requires an after-tax return of 18% before investing in a new project. If the 50% corporate tax were repealed, the corporation would no longer invest in every project that would yield 18%. Instead, the corporation would raise its requirement for new investments to a figure approaching 36%?the return its previously acceptable projects would now yield. Otherwise, it would be overwhelmed with eligible projects. Certainly the corporation would not cut its prices so that its investments would yield no more now than they previously did after profits had been diminished by a 50% tax. Instead, the corporation would maximize profits before tax, regardless of the level of taxation. Even if corporate pricing decisions are not designed to shift the corporate tax, it might be argued that the tax, by reducing potential return on equity capital, holds down the overall level of investment. This could result in less capital equipment and shortages in goods and services produced by corporations, thus indirectly forcing prices up. At least three factors undercut this theory. First, only rarely is the economy so near to full employment of its productive capacity that prices are driven up by pervasive shortages of goods and services. Second, partnerships, sole proprietors, and S corporations can still attract investment and compete uninhibited by corporate tax. Finally, the taxable corporations can raise capital by debt financing. The cost of this capital does not come out of taxed profits. To the extent that there is substance to the argument, my proposal, by making equity investment in publicly held corporations more attractive, will increase capital available to corporations. This, in turn, will increase corporate output of goods and services, reducing the likelihood that a shortage of goods and services will force prices up and permit the corporate tax burden to be passed on to consumers. VI. THE CORPORATION AS A TAXABLE ENTITY President Reagan is reported to have said that corporations do not bear taxes? only people pay taxes.51 The shareholders of a publicly held corporation, how ever, do not necessarily bear the tax currently paid by the corporation. There is a direct connection between the shareholders and that portion of the corporate tax paid with respect to corporate earnings actually distributed as dividends. Beyond that, their connection to the corporate tax burden is speculative and likely to vary with time and from corporation to corporation. 50A 50% tax rate is used to simplify computations. 5126 Tax Notes 625 (1985). Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="10">10 SECTION OF TAXATION That shareholders do not necessarily bear any of the corporate tax is easily demonstrated by the mutual savings banks. These corporations are governed by self-perpetuating boards of trustees and have no shareholders.52 Among other similar disembodied organizations are mutual life insurance companies, non stock savings and loan associations, credit unions, and non-profit corporations. All these types of corporations bear at least modest income tax burdens, but they have no shareholders. Management and lower echelon employees are among the real people who bear a portion of the burden of the income tax these organizations pay. Over a long period, other people who deal with the corporations, such as depositors, policyholders, or beneficiaries of charitable organizations, may be slightly affected by the corporate tax burden. The effect on them is difficult to measure, however, because the entitlements of people in these groups are fixed in amount, such as interest on bank deposits. Consequently, one is left to spec ulate on how the terms of their entitlements might have been improved absent the corporate tax. Thus at least some types of corporations pay income taxes that are not clearly or immediately assignable to any individuals, and their operations benefit many categories of individuals, including their own management groups. These cor porations should be taxed in their own right on their income. Indeed, there is no other feasible way to tax that income. At the opposite extreme, the closely held corporations usually operate as extensions of their individual shareholders and these individuals clearly do bear the corporate tax and benefit from the corporate operations. The publicly held corporations lie between the two extremes of corporations without shareholders and closely held corporations. Their beneficiaries are mixed, with two categories predominating: shareholders and management. The publicly held corporations, operated by management groups with varying degrees of independence, have lives of their own. Much more than mere exten sions of their individual shareholders, they are combinations of capital formed to achieve business advantages. They benefit from combined capital to take advantage of economies of size, strong market position, broad advertising appeal, reserves that provide staying power under adverse conditions, continuity of life, limited liability, and, at least in some instances, greater political power. All these advantages exist because the corporation is a separate entity. As such, the publicly held corporation is a viable and proper taxpayer in its own right. Its shareholders, whether in a low or high tax bracket individually, have invested in the corporate entity to benefit from its size and income-producing power. Consequently, the shareholders should expect the corporate entity to bear tax on its income before they receive their dividends. Their own individual circum stances that place them, as individuals, in one tax bracket or another have no real relation to the tax-bearing capacity of the corporation. Presumably, the shareholders of a closely held corporation also perceive ad vantages from operating as a separately taxed entity. If the advantage is to achieve 52See, e.g., N.Y. Banking Law ? 246 (McKinney 1971). Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="11">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 11 lower tax rates through income-splitting, that advantage will be removed by the proposal. If the remaining advantages are sufficient, the closely held corporation will remain in existence and be taxed as a separate entity. Essentially, the decision is up to the shareholders. A general partnership, or even a limited partnership, will avoid separate entity tax treatment.53 In most instances subchapter S status is also available. The tax on the income of the corporate entity should be at a flat rate. In part, we have drifted into a progressive tax rate schedule for the first $100,000 of corporate taxable income54 through thoughtless anthropomorphism. Corporations are not people, all the shareholders in a corporation do not share the same tax bracket, and the amount of a corporation's income bears no relation to the individual income levels of its shareholders. The principles used to justify pro gressive tax rates have been described as "ability to pay," "payments in accord with benefits received," "equality of sacrifice," and "reduction of inequal ity."55 These criteria are only relevant to the tax imposed on individuals, and none justify progressivity in the corporate income tax. The income level of a corporation is not a reliable measure of the ability to pay of the individuals who indirectly shoulder the burden of the tax. Moreover, the individuals indirectly bearing the corporate tax may vary widely as to the appropriate tax rate for their individual circumstances. Ironically, the present progressive corporate tax rates allow individuals setting up closely held corporations to partially avoid the progressive rates on their personal incomes by splitting income with their cor poration (this point is developed more fully infra). An additional rationale advanced for the progressive corporate tax is that it promotes small businesses.56 This theory, however, is seriously flawed. Small businesses in corporate form are generally closely held, and the progressive corporate tax bears no relation to the marginal tax rates of its alter egos, the shareholders. The 15% rate under section 11(b) is applied to $25,000 of corporate income even though some or all of the shareholders may be in the 50% tax bracket. Furthermore, the corporate rates are significantly lower than the rates imposed on individuals with comparable incomes, so that a small business op erated by a sole proprietor or a partnership is penalized. The progressive tax rate schedule for the first $100,000 of corporate income undercuts the progressive individual income tax. It permits a sole shareholder or small group of shareholders to split their incomes between themselves and their corporation to keep down the amount of income taxed at higher progressive 53The restriction of subchapter S eligibility under section 1371(a) to corporations with one class of stock precludes a subchapter S election in some instances. Perhaps a formula can be devised for allocating subchapter S income and loss among several classes of stock, so that eligibility will no longer be so restricted. 54I.R.C. ? 11(b). 55C.

For example, a sole proprietor earning $50,000 (assuming she is married, her spouse has no income, and deductions are not itemized) would pay a tax of $10,267 in 1985. If the business is incorporated and the corporation pays the sole shareholder a salary of $20,000, the corporation's tax on the remaining $30,000 will be $4,650 and the shareholder's tax will be $2,040. Thus the total tax will be $3,577 less than the tax paid on the same profit by a sole proprietor. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 amended section 11(b) to eliminate the pro gressivity in rates for corporations with income in excess of $1,000,000.57 Con sequently, there is no longer a progressive tax for corporations with large incomes, generally those that are publicly held. The total revenue lost by the progressive corporate rate schedule is estimated at $8.4 billion for fiscal 1986.58 Because publicly held corporations are likely to have incomes in excess of $1 million, most of the loss is probably due to income-splitting by the shareholders of closely held corporations. (It is estimated that $212 million was saved in 1985 by amending section 11(b) in 1984.)59 In addition to proposing the repeal of the progressive tax rate schedule for the first $100,000 of corporate taxable income, it is proposed that the alternative tax on net capital gains of corporations be repealed. Capital losses of corporations should be given ordinary loss treatment. These changes would be desirable regardless of the objective of eliminating double tax on dividends. The alternative tax on net capital gains does not play a major role for cor porations.60 The argument that the alternative tax is necessary to prevent bunched income from being taxed at a high rate under a progressive rate schedule has little application to corporations now and will have no application under the proposed flat corporate tax rate. Corporate capital gains are not given special treatment in the hands of shareholders when distributed as dividends, but unless corporate capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, shareholders allowed to exclude dividends on the assumption that they already have been taxed at the equivalent of the top individual rate would get a special benefit under the proposal. The revenue gain from eliminating the progressive corporate tax rates and the alternative tax on net capital gains will offset much of the revenue lost from excluding dividends at the shareholder level under the proposal. The proposal does not attempt to set the rate for the flat corporate income tax or to set the maximum individual income tax rate. For the proposal to operate fairly the flat corporate rate must be at least as high as the top individual rate. There does not appear to be any reason to set the corporate rate any higher than that. The corporate tax rate must not inhibit use of the 57Tax Reform Act of 1984, ? 66(a), Pub. L.

Similar considerations should govern in setting the top individual rate: it should not be at a level that is unrealistic for viable business operations, and it should not drive taxpayers into tax shelters that distort allocation of the factors of production. Fortunately, the present top rates for corporations and individuals differ by only four percentage points. The two rates could be brought together at 46% or at 50%, or at some lower rate if any of the current base broadening proposals are adopted. For illustrative purposes, the proposal will assume a 50% tax rate for both corporations and individuals in the highest tax bracket. VII. THE PROPOSAL AND THE PROGRESSIVE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX By excluding dividends from taxable income, the proposal benefits all indi vidual shareholders with taxed income. Obviously, the benefit is greater for individuals in higher tax brackets. Assuming no increase in dividend payout, the effect of the proposal on a $1,000 dividend out of previously taxed income on selected taxable income levels (married couples filing joint returns) at 1985 tax rates would be as follows: Present Treatment* Taxable Gross Tax on Dividend Income Dividend Dividend After Tax $ 1,000 $1,000 $ 0 $1,000 5,000 1,000 110 890 15,000 1,000 160 840 30,000 1,000 250 750 60,000 1,000 380 620 120,000 1,000 490 510 200,000 1,000 500 500 *Ignores the $100/$200 dividend exclusion under section 116.

Under the present double tax system the high bracket shareholders have the tax advantage of exclusion for earnings retained by the corporation. The proposal will extend that advantage to distributed earnings as well, after assuring that the distributed earnings first have borne corporate tax at a rate equal to the maximum individual rate. In other words, individual shareholders with high marginal tax rates are treated more unfairly by the present double tax than shareholders with low marginal tax rates. Consequently, relieving all shareholders of the double tax necessarily must relieve the high bracket individuals of a greater burden than low bracket indi viduals. The same calculations of present treatment that were used in the pre ceding table illustrate the present discrimination in burden of the double tax.

Any change that reduces the taxable incomes of taxpayers in all income classes will give greater benefits to those taxed at higher rates. Progressivity and regressivity are concepts useful in evaluating the distribution of the tax burden as a whole. They have no role, however, in deciding whether a specific provision is fair or consistent with the overall philosophy of the income tax. If the effect of an improvement in the design of the tax is to make the distribution of the overall tax burden less progressive than before, and that is considered undesirable, then the proper approach should be separately to address and improve the degree of progressivity by changing the tax rates. Concealed progressivity through a structual flaw that bears more heavily on high bracket taxpayers has no more merit than concealed regressivity through a structual flaw that allows high bracket taxpayers a benefit not available to others. Some idea of the extent to which individuals in various tax brackets might be affected by the proposal can be obtained from the breakdown of dividend re cipients among adjusted gross income classes in the 661982 Statistics of Income, Individual Income Tax Returns."61 Total dividends received were $54 billion. 6,Internal Revenue Service, 1982 Statistics of Income, Individual Income Tax Returns 44-54. Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="15">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 15 A crude conversion of the adjusted gross income classes of the recipients to their 1985 marginal tax rates can be computed by applying a rule of thumb assumption that 23% of adjusted gross income is deducted.62 Based on 1982 data, the distribution of dividends by 1985 marginal tax rates of recipients is roughly as follows: Amount of Marginal Dividends Total Tax Rate (%) (millions) Dividends (%) -0- $ 1,665 3.08 11-16 7,826 14.48 16-25 10,781 19.95 28-42 15,996 29.60 42-49 6,345 11.74 49-50 11,431 21.15 This pattern of dividend distributions could change as a result of different div idend payment policies when the proposal is in effect. The proposal here is "progressive" in its impact in one major respect. By taxing corporate income in full at a rate equal to the maximum individual rate, the proposal will end use of closely held corporations as income-splitting devices whereby shareholders divide their incomes with their corporations and maximize the amounts taxed at lower rates. Thus the proposal will make the income tax more progressive because it will eliminate a device used to avoid the progressive individual tax rate schedule. VIII. APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSAL Application of the proposal requires identifying income that has been previ ously taxed at the corporate level, prescribing the role of earnings and profits accounts (particularly in the treatment of corporate tax preferences), and pro viding rules for basis adjustments by individual and corporate shareholders, intercorporate dividends, consolidated returns, public utility dividends, preferred stock dividends, stock redemptions and corporate liquidations, eligible dividends, interaction of the proposal with foreign taxing jurisdictions, limits on interest deductions by shareholders, dividend withholding, and various administrative considerations. A. The Previously Taxed Income Account Under the proposal, dividends eligible for exclusion will be limited to those paid from previously taxed income. A corporation's previously taxed income will be taxable income reduced by the accrued liability for federal income tax on the income, the corporation's foreign tax credit,63 and the adjustments, de "Treasury Department and Joint Committee on Taxation staff estimators generally use this rule of thumb assumption. 63I.R.C. ?? 901-908. Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="16">16 SECTION OF TAXATION scribed below, for the investment tax credit (ITC)64 and the targeted jobs credit.65 Each corporation will keep a running account of its previously taxed income, similar in some respects to its accumulated earnings and profits account. The previously taxed income account will be increased each year by the year's previously taxed income and by dividends the corporation receives that come out of the previously taxed income accounts of other corporations distributing dividends to the corporation. The account will be reduced by dividends distributed from the account, by losses carried back and deducted against income of years subject to the proposal, and by the adjustments (described later) for any ITC or targeted jobs credit. It will be necessary to deny deduction of net operating and capital loss car rybacks to the extent the effect of the deduction would be to reduce a previously taxed income amount that already had been distributed. Unfortunately, denial of these loss carrybacks will be necessary, because the alternative of requiring shareholders to convert previously excluded dividends into taxable income and file amended returns would not be feasible. To the extent a carryback can be used without affecting previously taxed income already distributed, it will be allowed as before, with a consequent reduction of the amount in the corporation's previously taxed income account. A loss carryback that is denied to avoid its affect on a previously taxed income amount that already has been distributed will be carried forward and applied first against gross income of the subsequent year, i.e., before deductions arising in that year, on the same principle as carryforwards of unused investment credit. Carrybacks of unused credits will be similarly treated. Carryforwards present no difficulties in implementing the proposal. Although the previously taxed income account will perform a role similar to that of the accumulated earnings and profits account, it will be necessary to retain earnings and profits accounts for two purposes?(1) to identify distribu tions out of earnings and profits accumulated before the effective date of the proposal, and (2) to identify distributions out of earnings and profits of years subject to the proposal that are larger than the previously taxed income account as a result of tax preferences. Such distributions, which are not out of previously taxed income, will continue to be included in the shareholder's gross income. When there is previously taxed income, however, distributions will be out of the previously taxed income first. Earnings and profits accumulated prior to the effective date will be taxed when distributed to shareholders. Some of these earnings have not borne tax at the corporate level and some were taxed at the corporate level at rates lower than the present marginal individual tax rate. Even when the prior accumulations have borne tax equal to the present marginal individual tax rate, exempting this income from double tax would be an unjustified windfall to the shareholders because "I.R.C. ? 38. 65Id. i ax Lawyer, voi. jy, ino. i</page><page sequence="17">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 17 they bought and held their stock with the expectation that distributions of earnings and profits for those years would be taxed. Retaining the concept of accumulated earnings and profits is helpful in applying the proposal in the context of our complex mix of tax preferences. The proposal would be simpler if tax preferences were eliminated altogether. Such a drastic overhaul of our tax system is not necessary, however, to implement the proposal. It is feasible in conjunction with the present tax preferences. Present law prevents pass through to individual shareholders of an array of tax preferences arising from the definition of gross income and the allowance of deductions at the corporate level.66 These include municipal bond interest, life insurance proceeds (net over insurance premiums), percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion, depreciation deductions in excess of the allowances provided in section 312(k), and the items for which section 312(n) provides treatment for earnings and profits purposes.67 These are items that clearly should not be eligible for exclusion by individual shareholders on the theory that they already have been taxed. Treatment to be accorded such tax preferences depends on one's goal. If the goal were integration of the corporate and shareholder tax bases, it would be logical to pass these tax preference benefits through to the shareholders. Because the goal of the proposal is to eliminate double taxation of dividends, however, it is not appropriate to do so. Income shielded from tax at the corporate level by these preferences will not be double taxed when distributed to shareholders, but rather, will be taxed for the first time. These items will be treated no better or worse under the proposal than presently. Not every tax preference arising from the definition of gross income is given different treatment for earnings and profits purposes.68 Insofar as other tax preferences reduce taxable income at the corporate level, they will not increase the previously taxed income account that determines the amount of dividends to be excluded. If a corporation has neither taxable income nor earnings and profits because of tax preferences, the tax treatment of distri butions to its shareholders will not be changed by the proposal. The distri butions will continue to reduce basis until it is exhausted and thereafter will be recognized as capital gain.69 In addition to tax preferences through deductions, there are tax preferences awarded to taxpayers as incentive-type tax credits. For corporations these are the ITC and the targeted jobs credit.70 These credits are not carried through to shareholders under present law. Instead, earnings and profits are larger by ^References to tax preferences are not limited to the items listed in section 57(a). 67I.R.C. ? 312(k), (n); Regs. ? 1.312-6(b) to -6(c). 68See, e.g., I.R.C. ? 593(b)(2) (providing additions to reserves for bad debts by savings and loan associations and other thrift institutions using the percentage of taxable income method). 69I.R.C. ? 301(c)(2), (3). 70I.R.C. ? 38.

As with preference items in the form of deductions, these incentive-type tax credits will be treated no better or worse under the proposal than they are treated currently. When witnesses testifed on the Ullman plan at the 1978 Ways and Means Committee hearings, representatives of the electric utilities and AT &amp; T objected to the Ullman plan's failure to give shareholders the benefit of investment tax credits earned at the corporate level.71 The criticisms illustrated a failure to distinguish between the goal of integrating corporate and shareholder tax and the quite different goal of eliminating (or, at least, reducing) double taxation of dividends. Overstating his case, one witness argued that, without pass-through of the ITC to the shareholders, the benefit would be completely destroyed,72 leading one to wonder how the credit could be of benefit now, since the credit is not passed through to the shareholders under present law. The objection made on behalf of the utilities was that relief of dividends from double taxation would deprive capital-intensive industries of their pres ent competitive advantage in attracting capital. In essence, the argument was that they had such generous treatment at the corporate level (through accel erated depreciation as well as the ITC) that their shareholders are not suffering unduly from double taxation. This was a dog-in-the-manger attitude: Congress should not grant relief to the corporations and shareholders suffering from double taxation because it will reduce the competitive advantage to which we have become accustomed. In fact, as is developed in the discussion of the proposed treatment of utility dividends, the proposal would make utility stocks more attractive investments relative to stocks of other business corporations. The proposal adjusts for incentive-type tax credits by reducing the previously taxed income account by the deduction equivalents of the credits. The adjustments are varying percentages of the credits, depending upon whether the credit is an investment credit without a basis adjustment, an investment credit with a basis adjustment of 50% of the credit, or a targeted jobs credit denying a deduction of 100% of the credit. Applying a corporate tax rate of 50%, the following examples illustrate the percentages of the credits to be reflected in reductions of the previously taxed income accounts: 1. Assume that a corporation elects an 8% investment credit on $1,000,000 of eligible property, in lieu of reducing basis by 50% of the amount of the credit,73 and that taxable income is $2,000,000: ^Hearings on the President's 1978 Tax Reduction and Reform Proposals before the House Comm. on Ways and Means, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 6111 (1978) (statement of William S.

It is necessary to determine the sequence in which distributions will clear out the three corporate accounts?(1) the previously taxed income account (dividends not taxable), (2) the account for earnings and profits accumulated before the effective date of the proposal (dividends taxable), and (3) the account reflecting the excess of earnings and profits accumulated after the effective date of the proposal over the previously taxed income account (dividends taxable). The proposal will end the present treatment of distributions from current earnings and profits as taxable dividends when there is a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits.75 The present treatment of "nimble dividends" is an his torical accident. When Congress imposed an additional income tax on undistrib 75I.R.C. ? 316(a)(2). Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="21">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 21 uted profits of corporations in 1936,76 it became apparent that a corporation, if it had a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits, could not avoid the tax even by making distributions to its shareholders out of current income. Consequently, the definition of dividends was amended to include distributions from earnings and profits of the current year.77 The undistributed profit tax was repealed in 1938.78 The definition of dividends, however, was not changed, even though its original function of validating deductions from the base for the undistributed profits tax had disappeared. Treating distributions of current earnings and profits as dividends has had little purpose since 1938, though Professor Andrews has pointed out that the present treatment does prevent an individual from receiving tax free distributions from a corporation that earns profits after the individual bought his stock but had a deficit in its accumulated earnings account.79 (No parallel relief is provided an individual who buys stock in a corporation with accumulated earnings and is taxed on subsequent distributions, even though the corporation has losses subsequent to the stock purchase.) Continuation of the present treatment of distributions from current earnings would serve no purpose under the proposal. Conceivably, each distribution could be prorated among the three accounts, but such an approach would be more complex and difficult to administer than ordering distributions from the three accounts in a specified sequence, and there is no obvious theoretical justification for such an approach. The revenue cost of the proposal would be lowest if distributions were treated as first out of accumulated earnings and profits accumulated before the effective date of the proposal. This sequence would also minimize the windfall to share holders gained through changes in the value of their investments to reflect the new treatment of dividends. In the case of a corporation with large accumulated earnings and profits relative to the current annual dividend, years might elapse before taxable dividends would clear out this accumulated account. In such a case, the time discount on eventual impact of the new treatment would minimize the effect of the change on the current market value of the stock. Such a sequence for labeling distributions would give a decided advantage to new corporations and to corporations previously operated at a loss. One practical difficulty with treating earlier accumulations as distributed first is that eventually all corporations with previously accumulated earnings and profits would have to determine the exact amount in that account. Another problem is that it would increase the number and gravity of instances in which shareholders selling their stock would forfeit the benefit of excluding dividends paid from previously taxed income. Their gain on disposition would be taxed, even though it reflected undistributed previously taxed income. Finally, such a sequence would create tremendous pressure for liquidation-reincorporation schemes. 76Revenue Act of 1936, ch. 690, ? 14, 49 Stat. 1648. 17Id. ? 115(a); see also I.R.C. ?? 301, 316 (current Code sections). 78Revenue Act of 1938, ch. 289, ? 14, 52 Stat. 447. 79Andrews, "Out of Its Earnings and Profits": Some Reflections on the Taxation of Dividends, 69 Harv.

Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="22">22 SECTION OF TAXATION To obviate this difficulty, distributions in liquidation could be treated as dividends to the extent of accumulated earnings and profits. Ordering the sequence of dividend distributions as first out of previously taxed income would mitigate the disparate treatment of shareholders receiving exclud ible dividends from previously taxed income and shareholders who are taxed on gain from the sale of stock that reflects the undistributed previously taxed income. In addition, it would reduce the occasions when a shareholder receives excludible dividends paid from previously taxed income earned and taxed at the corporate level before the shareholder purchased the stock. On balance, it would be preferable to make the proposal fully effective from the outset by ordering the sequence of distributions so that dividends are treated as first from previously taxed income, eligible for exclusion. Regardless of whether distributions are treated as first from pre-effective date earnings and profits or first from previously taxed income, distributions from post-effective date earnings and profits that exceed the previously taxed income should follow the exhaustion of the previously taxed income account. Moreover, insofar as tax preferences giving rise to this account are intended as incentives for taxpayers, there is no reason that the incentive effect should not continue to operate while dividends eligible for exclusion are distributed to shareholders. This sequence will discourage distribution of such amounts and thus prolong the incentive effects. It will also minimize the disparate treatment of C corporations as con trasted with S corporations and partnerships. The proposal in the 1984 Treasury Study for corporate deduction of 50% of dividends paid is limited to distributions of previously taxed earnings and profits.80 Similarly, the proposal for corporate deduction of 10% of dividends paid in President Reagan's 1985 Tax Proposals is limited to dividends "attributable to corporate earnings that have borne the regular corporate income tax."81 It is implicit in the Treasury plan and the President's proposal that distributions be considered as first out of amounts eligible for the proposed deduction, before distribution of tax preference income and before distribution of earnings and profits accumulated prior to the effective date, neither of which would be eligible for the proposed deduction. The "Qualified Dividend Account" proposed in the Treasury Study and the President's proposal is similar to the previously taxed income account proposed here. Under the proposal, previously taxed income accounts would carry over to successor corporations under the rules in section 381 for carryover of earnings and profits accounts. B.

It would be impractical, however, to apply this to all individual shareholders because they cannot be expected to keep track of whether distributions to them are out of early or recent previously taxed income. Distributing corporations could not be held responsible for notifying shareholders when they should reduce basis because stock held in street names makes it impossible for a corporation to know when an individual purchased the stock. Corporations could, however, be required routinely to supply to their shareholders a schedule of the source of each year's dividends, including the source year or years of the previously taxed income being distrib uted. Even so, the compliance burden would make it unrealistic to expect all individual shareholders to make appropriate basis adjustments. A partial, piecemeal solution is proposed that includes the following: (1) ordering distributions so that the most recently earned, previously taxed income is treated as distributed first (which reduces the size of the problems); (2) requiring mutual funds to make appropriate adjustments; and (3) requiring shareholders owning over 1% of a corporation's stock or owning stock of a corporation with a value in excess of some specified amount to make appropriate adjustments. The adjustments will be in the form of reductions in basis equal to distributions of previously taxed income earned by the payer corporation, or by corporations in which that corporation owned stock, in taxable years of the payer corporation prior to the year in which the shareholder purchased the stock. No upward adjustment to basis would be made for shareholders selling stock before the corporation has distributed previously taxed income earned while the stockholder owned the stock. This might be perceived as inconsistent with the objective of eliminating double tax on corporate income. It can be defended, however, on the ground of practicality. Moreover, it is within the corporation's power to avoid the double tax in large measure by distributing its previously taxed income out promptly as dividends. Unfairness will be minimized by se quencing distributions so that the most recently earned previously taxed income is considered to be distributed first. C. Intercorporate Dividends Under the proposal, all intercorporate dividends on common stock will be excluded (or deducted) by the recipient corporation, including those paid from earnings and profits accumulated before the effective date of the proposal. The basis of each share of stock of the distributing corporation held by the recipient corporation will be reduced by distributions on the specific share of stock that are out of earnings and profits (or previously taxed income) earned before the recipient corporation or its predecessor purchased the share of stock. A prede cessor will be any person from whom the recipient corporation acquired the share of stock in a section 351 transaction, a section 368 exchange, or as a dividend in kind. The principle was accepted in part by Congress in 1984 when it enacted section 1059, which reduces a corporate shareholder's basis in stock Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="24">24 SECTION OF TAXATION held not longer than a year by the nontaxed portion of any extraordinary dividend amounts.82 An intercompany dividend out of previously taxed income will be reflected in the previously taxed income account of the recipient corporation. Thus the dividend will retain its identity so that it may eventually be passed on to an individual shareholder eligible for the exclusion. In order to keep track of previously taxed income as it flows through inter mediate corporate shareholders before ultimate distribution to individuals, there must be a single definition of earnings and profits. For this reason, section 301(f) must be repealed. This subsection, added in 1984,83 makes the earnings and profits definition rules in section 312(n) largely inapplicable in characterizing distributions to corporate shareholders owning at least 20% of the distributing corporation's stock. Section 301(f) converts some intercorporate dividends into distributions out of capital that reduce the basis of the distributing corporation's stock in the hands of the recipient. This should no longer be necessary with the basis adjustments under the proposal for intercorporate dividends out of earnings prior to the time the dividend recipient purchased the stock. Repealing section 301(f) would clearly promote simplicity; the present system requires the same corporation to characterize distributions to different shareholders under two dif ferent earnings and profits definitions. The basis adjustments described for intercompany dividends would be desir able even if the proposal is not adopted. They provide a complete solution to the problem Congress has addressed in part in section 1059. In addition, they resolve the presently inconsistent treatment of intercompany distributions of pre acquisition earnings and profits between separate returns and consolidated re turns.84 Finally, the adjustments proposed will be fairer and more precise than the present consolidated return regulation basis adjustments for distributions from pre-affiliation and other separate return limitation years. D. Consolidated Returns Even when consolidated returns are filed, the previously taxed income account of the parent corporation of the affiliated group will be computed on a separate basis. The separate taxable income of the parent will be determined as provided in Regulations section 1.1502-27(b), and then reduced by the parent's share of the consolidated tax liability determined under the tax allocation method the group has chosen under section 1552 and Regulations section 1.1502-33(d). This determination of a separate previously taxed income account will be independent of the current earnings and profits adjustments prescribed in Regulations section 1.1502-33(c)(4)(ii). The basis adjustments for intercompany dividends generally will be incorporated in the present basis adjustment rules in Regulations section 1.1502-32. 82Tax Reform Act of 1984, ? 53(a), Pub. L.

Public Utilities Dividends As long as the corporate income tax is treated as an expense recoverable by public utility corporations through regulated rates, their corporate tax will be borne by the ratepayers, not the stockholders. In these circumstances, there is no double tax to justify the exclusion of dividends. A simple solution would be to exclude public utility dividends from the proposal. Such a solution would place the utilities at a competitive disadvantage in selling new stock issues, however, and this would be a serious problem because the utilities are among the principal industries relying on new stock issues for capital. On the other hand, making dividend exclusion fully available on utility stock while the cor porate tax continues to be treated as an expense would mean that dividends distributed to Utility shareholders would bear no tax at the shareholder level. The unwarranted assumption is that the shareholders bore the corporate tax associated with the earnings from which the dividends were paid when, in fact, the ratepayers were charged with this tax. Enactment of the proposal would obviate the need for public utility regulators to treat the corporate income tax on utilities as an expense. Income tax on dividends received from utilities never has been considered a cost of utility operation. If that tax is removed on the assumption that tax has been borne by the shareholders' corporation, the corporate level tax on the utilities should be viewed as imposed in lieu of tax at the shareholder level, i.e., in lieu of a tax that has not heretofore been treated as a cost for ratemaking. Continuing to treat the corporate tax as a cost would defeat the intent of Congress in enacting the proposal. Consequently, one would expect the Supreme Court to rule that the doctrine of Georgia Ry. &amp; Power Co. v. Railroad Commission*5 and Galveston Electric Co. v. City of Galveston*6 no longer applies in the context of a single tax on corporate income. Further complicating the situation for utilities is the practice of normalizing the charge for income tax (i.e., treating as an expense a "normal" income tax calculated from realistic depreciation deductions, as contrasted with the ACRS). To make allowance for this advance tax expense element, it is proposed that earnings and profits of a public utility should not be treated as previously taxed income until the account representing normalized tax expense has been elimi nated, either by actual tax liability exceeding "normal" tax, or by distribution of taxable dividends until an amount of earnings and profits has been distributed that would represent the after-tax reciprocal of an amount equal to the account for normalized tax expense. Denying cost treatment for corporate tax should not disadvantage utility com panies in attracting equity capital. The prospect of dividend exclusion will gen erally make stock investments more attractive. Utility stocks depend on relatively high dividends to achieve marketability, and these dividends no longer will be taxed to the shareholders. This is in contrast to stocks of corporations in other 85262 U.S. 625, 633 (1923). 86258 U.S. 388, 399 (1922). Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="26">26 SECTION OF TAXATION industries that attract investment by the potential for appreciation in market value in addition to a current return through dividends. The proposal does not relieve shareholders of tax on their capital gains from stock investments. Instead, the proposal will make capital gain from stock sales relatively less attractive. The investor in public utility stocks, however, has never had a potential for capital gain comparable to the investor in common stock of other corporations; instead, the utility investor looks primarily to current return through dividends. Because of the limited prospects for appreciation in market value, the current yield on common stock of public utilities is much higher than that of common stocks of nonutility corporations of comparable risk. The initial impact of the proposal will be to make utility stocks significantly more attractive relative to common stocks of other corporations. Under these circumstances, the ratemaking authorities will be able to deny expense treatment of the corporate tax without jeopardizing the utilities' prospects for raising new capital through stock offerings. Utility management will perceive that dividend exclusion coupled with denial of expense treatment for their corporate taxes will make their shares more attractive in the market. Consequently, enlightened self interest by the utility corporations should lead them to initiate, or at least not resist, removal of the corporate tax from the schedule of allowed expenses. Unless the ratemaking procedures are changed so that their shareholders bear the corporate tax, Congress will make dividends from their corporations ineligible for the exclusion. That would seriously disadvantage the utilities in competing in the market for equity capital. F. Dividends on Preferred Stock Preferred stock occupies an anomalous position between common stock and debt. Even though dividends on preferred are paid from after-tax dollars, an exclusion for dividends on preferred stock issued before the effective date of the proposal would not be justified. Such stock's price reflected the risk that after tax income might not be adequate to cover the dividend, but when a preferred shareholder receives the full dividend on such stock, he does not bear any portion of the corporate tax because he could receive no more than the stated dividend in any event. Consequently, dividends on previously issued preferred stock will be ineligible for exclusion under the proposal.87 This rule could not be defeated by a recapitalization of previously issued preferred. For new issues of preferred stock after the effective date of the proposal, dividends will be excluded on the same basis as dividends on common stock. If the previously taxed income account is not sufficient to cover both the common and the preferred distributions, it will be applied first against the distribution on common because the common is more likely to bear the burden of corporate tax on distributed earnings. If this treatment is known from the outset, the market price of the stock can be relied on to reflect it so that the stated dividend will 87In the 1984 Treasury Report, the proposed dividend deduction is limited in the case of preferred stock to preferred stock issued after 1986. Treasury Report, supra note 4, at 140. Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="27">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 27 be commensurately lower. Thus the preferred dividend will be less of a burden on the remaining corporate earnings available after tax for common shareholders, indirectly justifying its exclusion. With a flat corporate tax rate that matches the marginal individual tax rate, the full tax is assured, so that it is possible to rely on market prices to set the dividend rate and the issue price for future issues of preferred stock to assign the tax burden to the preferred shareholders. G. Eligible Types of Distributions Boot in a reorganization that is characterized as a dividend under section 356(a) will be excluded if the corporation has a sufficiently large previously taxed income account. For this purpose, boot will be characterized as a dividend without regard to whether it represents gain to the shareholder, so that adjustments can be made to the previously taxed income account without having to know the gain or loss circumstances of the shareholders. Dividends in kind will qualify for exclusion under the proposal, but only if gain or loss is realized by the distributing corporation. Section 311(d) will be broadened under the proposal to apply in all cases, making gain or loss to the distributing corporation in an in-kind distribution the universal rule. When gain is recognized to the distributing corporation on a distribution of property in partial liquidation or redemption under section 311(d), the resulting previously taxed income will be taken into account in determining whether a dividend segment in the liquidation or redemption is eligible for exclusion. If a stock redemption or partial liquidation is characterized as a dividend, the portion of the constructive dividend that is out of the corporation's previously taxed income will be excluded, as though an actual dividend had been distributed. Logically, the rule in section 311(d) should be extended to complete liqui dations as well, instead of the present rule in section 336. If this were done, the rule in section 311(d) should be broadened to take into account losses as well as gains realized by the liquidating corporation. Liquidating distributions could then be treated by individual shareholders as excluded dividends up to the amount in the liquidating corporation's previously taxed income account. This would not, however, provide an exclusion for a shareholder who sold stock in antici pation of a liquidation, because there would be no distribution directly by the corporation to the former shareholder. Section 304 was enacted to block perceived abuses by withdrawing funds from corporate solution through capital gains transactions rather than as dividends.88 Under the proposal, corporations will be less likely to structure transactions of the type section 304 was designed to reach. In conjunction with the proposal it would be advisable to provide that section 304 may be invoked only by the Service. When invoked, the resulting dividends may qualify for exclusion on the same basis as dividends distributed directly. %*See Revenue Act of 1950, ch. 994, ? 208, 64 Stat. 906. Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="28">28 SECTION OF TAXATION H. Interaction with Foreign Taxing Jurisdictions Under the proposal, foreign shareholders in United States corporations will be eligible for dividend exclusion on the same basis as domestic shareholders. The rationale for this treatment is simply that the corporate income is considered to have already borne its proper tax before it is distributed, whether distributed to foreign or domestic shareholders. The proposal will bring the treatment of dividend income more closely in line with the exemption of interest income provided by the Tax Reform Act of 1984.89 Domestic shareholders will not be permitted to exclude dividends from foreign corporations under the proposal, except to the extent that the dividends are from foreign corporations that are engaged in business in the United States and meet the qualifications in section 245. United States corporations receiving dividends from foreign corporations will be treated under the proposal the same way they are treated now. When a domestic corporation has a foreign tax credit, including the deemed paid credit, its pre viously taxed income will be computed as though the credited taxes had been paid to the United States. Thus, earnings after foreign income taxes and any additional United States corporate income tax will be included in the previously taxed income account. United States individuals receiving dividends from foreign corporations will be treated under the proposal in the same way they are treated now. The dividends will not be excluded, but the shareholder will be entitled to a foreign tax credit for taxes imposed on the dividends. Because the proposal will allow earnings subjected to foreign tax at the cor porate level to qualify for exclusion when distributed to the shareholders, it ordinarily will provide more advantageous tax treatment for individuals than the tax treatment they would receive if they owned stock directly in a foreign cor poration and received dividends directly. In the latter case, only the foreign tax imposed upon their dividends is eligible for the foreign tax credit. To the extent that a foreign country ameliorates or eliminates double tax on dividends by relieving its corporations from tax and imposing its tax on the shareholders, United States individual taxpayers, through our foreign tax credit, receive the benefit of only one tax. This would not be changed by the proposal. If a foreign country provides relief for its resident shareholders in that country's corporations by some form of credit for corporate tax paid90 or by an exclusion, as in the proposal, United States shareholders get no benefit under present United States law and will get none under the proposal. There is a consequent misal location of investment among foreign countries under the proposal but there will be tax neutrality between investment in domestic corporations and investment in corporations of countries that tax distributed income to the shareholders rather than the distributing corporation. 89Tax Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-369, ? 127, 98 Stat. 494. ^For a description and analysis of systems in several foreign countries, see Gourevitch, Corporate Tax Integration: The European Experience, 31 Tax Lawyer 65 (1977). Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="29">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 29 The proposal is not designed as a step in a coordinated program by a group of countries to eliminate double tax on dividends on a consistent basis. It is a proposal for one country to apply unilaterally, and it maintains tax neutrality, as in the case of present law, only in the choice of investment by domestic corporations between domestic investment and foreign investment. I. Interest Deduction by Shareholders Under the proposal, shareholders will not be allowed to deduct interest on indebtedness incurred to carry investment in stocks yielding excluded dividends. Otherwise, investment in dividend-paying stocks financed with borrowed funds could generate interest deductions that would "shelter" or offset the sharehold er's income from other sources. Without a restriction on the interest deduction, it would be possible to shelter an amount of income equal to the interest paid, with no current cost to the taxpayer so long as the excluded dividends equalled the amount of interest paid. If the objective were to integrate treatment of the corporation and the share holder to determine income tax liability, then one could argue that indebtedness of the shareholder is merely a substitute for corporate debt and that interest should be deductible whether the indebtedness is that of the shareholder or that of the corporation. This proposal here, however, is based on treatment of the corporation as a separate taxpaying entity. To the extent that it is capitalized with borrowed funds, it will be entitled to deduct interest within the confines of present law. The shareholders, however, should not be entitled to deduct the cost of carrying their investment in stock that will produce a tax-exempt yield because it has previously been taxed at the corporate level. The approach used under section 265(2) for denying deduction of interest on funds borrowed to carry investments in tax-exempt bonds is not satisfactory.91 It is wrong in concept because it ignores the fungibility of borrowed money and, instead, engages in a futile game of tracing based on intent. It is also uncertain in application and difficult to administer. Finally, it has failed completely to reach the banks, major investors in tax-exempt securities, who, nevertheless, are not prevented by section 265(2) from deducting interest paid their deposi tors.92 In lieu of the tracing approach used in section 265(2), the proposal's approach is to deny individual shareholders deduction for interest paid or incurred, dollar for dollar, up to the total amount of excluded dividends received. Although drastic, the proposed treatment has the virtue of simplicity. 9lSee generally Oliver, Section 265(2): A Counterproductive Solution to a Nonexistent Problem, 40 Tax L. Rev. 351 (1985). 92Congress has responded by providing a 20% reduction in the interest deduction otherwise allowable for interest on debt incurred by financial institutions to purchase tax-exempt obligations.

Add-On Minimum Tax Under the proposal, amounts subject to the add-on minimum tax will not be considered previously taxed income because such amounts will not have borne the full corporate tax rate. K. Dividend Witholding A potential problem in administering the proposal is that individual share holders might ignore, forget, or not understand the distinction between the taxable dividends they receive and the dividends they receive that are eligible for ex clusion. The problem could be ameliorated to some extent by the information on Form 1099s furnished by the distributing corporations, but to avoid this problem altogether, it is proposed that dividend-paying corporations withhold tax at a specified percentage, say 20%, from dividends other than those from previously taxed income that are eligible for exclusion. Withholding will not be required on dividends distributed to corporate shareholders. L. Audit Adjustments Audit adjustments to a corporation's taxable income of past years will be a problem under the proposal only if the adjustments reduce corporate taxable income. In such a case, there still will be no problem so long as the remaining taxable income is sufficient to support the portion of the previously taxed income account that has been distributed. For this purpose, it is not necessary that there be sufficient previously taxed income remaining in the account that is derived from the year adjusted on the audit; the entire previously taxed income account may be adjusted. If a reduction of taxable income on audit exceeds the entire remaining previously taxed income account, it will be necessary to postpone the effect of the audit adjustment and apply it against taxable income of subsequent years. An audit adjustment that increases taxable income for past years will merely increase the previously taxed income account available for future dividend dis tributions. M. Treatment of Exclusion as a Deduction Conceptually, the proposal is clearer when explained as an exclusion by in dividual shareholders of dividends paid out of previously taxed income. To assist administration of the proposal and to provide a record on tax returns of excluded dividends that reduce the basis of a shareholder's stock, however, the proposal will be accomplished through the mechanism of an above-the-line deduction from gross income. IX. CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROPOSAL This proposal will enable Congress to repeal the accumulated earnings tax93 and the personal holding company tax.94 Both these taxes are designed to enforce 93I.R.C. ? 531. 94I.R.C. ? 541. Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="31">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 31 double taxation by imposing penalty taxes on corporate retained earnings. Both taxes will be pointless under the proposal because distributions of corporate earnings will not be taxed to the shareholders if the earnings have been fully taxed at the corporate level. If earnings retained by a corporation have been sheltered by tax preferences, this will not be the type of abuse justifying a penalty tax on the corporation because the tax preferences could have been used by the shareholders directly without interposing the corporate form. The proposal will substantially diminish the locked-in effect under present law by removing the tax advantage of having a corporation retain earnings. To the extent that the appreciation in stock value reflects earnings realized by the corporation and accumulated after the effective date of the proposal, a dividend distribution will solve the shareholder's locked-in problem. Although the proposal opens an avenue of escape from the present locked-in effect from appreciation in stock values due to retained earnings?distribution of excluded dividends?it will create another, albeit smaller, deterrent to the sale of stock by a shareholder. A shareholder's gain on sale of stock that is attributable to previously taxed but retained corporate earnings will not be ex cluded from gross income. Perhaps this shareholder deserves relief from double taxation, but it would be impractical to adapt the proposal to accomodate the selling shareholder. There would be tremendous administrative difficulties and complexities in isolating and excluding that portion of a selling shareholder's gain attributable to undistributed previously taxed income. There would be a further problem of assuring that the buyer of the stock could not qualify for a second exclusion when the previously taxed income is distributed later. A single tax on corporate income will substantially reduce the pressure for shareholders in closely held corporations to pass off equity investment as share holder-owned debt. When the proposal is in effect the tax considerations in deciding on equity or stockholder-owned debt usually will be reduced to a comparison of the projected marginal tax rate of the shareholder/creditor with the flat rate of the corporate tax. This is the comparison made now in deciding between paying salaries to shareholders or having the corporation retain the amount in its earnings and profits. Another tax factor may intrude on occasion, however, if the shareholders attempt to realize an individual loss or achieve a corporate stepped-up basis by characterizing a transfer of property to the cor poration as a sale in exchange for a debt obligation rather than a tax free exchange for stock. The proposal will not remove this conflict. The proposal will have some effect on the debt-equity ratios of publicly held corporations. The exclusion of dividends will improve the market for stock, in comparison to the market for debt obligations, and thus make it easier for corporations to raise equity capital. The proposal is not designed to create a tax environment that is completely neutral between debt and equity financing. Return on debt capital furnished by individuals will be taxed at their individual tax rates and the return on equity capital will be taxed at the corporate rate, which fre quently will be higher. Furthermore, aside from tax rate differences, the interests of the corporation as seen by management may not equate shareholder exclusion Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="32">32 SECTION OF TAXATION of dividends with corporate deduction of interest. With the wide differences in the substantive rights of creditors as compared with shareholders, there is no reason why the tax system should treat payments of dividends and interest exactly the same. In the case of a similar dichotomy, no one suggests that payments of dividends and rent should be treated the same. The proposal will do nothing to relieve pressure to characterize corporate securities held by exempt organizations as debt rather than equity. As is the case now, there is an incentive for the payer corporation to treat such a security as a debt obligation with deductible interest, and there is no countervailing pressure from the payee organization for whom the receipts will be exempt in either case. The present double tax on dividends makes it attractive for owners of closely held corporations to sell out, either through leveraged buyouts or through taxable or tax free acquisitions by competitors or conglomerates. The proposal will reduce the incentive to enter into these transactions. Under the proposal, decisions between retaining and distributing future cor porate earnings will be made in a tax neutral environment. This could have an enormous impact on the dividend and investment policies of publicly held cor porations. Management of publicly held corporations will be deprived of the excuse that it is for the tax benefit of the shareholders to retain earnings. This should be at least a small step away from management control and toward corporate democracy through stockholder control. Under neoclassical economic analysis, a more efficient allocation of investment should be achieved by removal of the present artificial tax pressure against distributions. A drastic increase in dividend distributions will affect one of the two major sources of corporate investment funds, the two sources being reinvestment of retained earnings and investment of depreciation reserves. There will be a drop in capital investment by corporations when less earnings are retained unless the stockholders reinvest their dividends. Dividend reinvestment plans may be a useful technique for corporations to partially replace their former reliance on retained earnings. Professor Andrews, in the Reporter's Proposals appended to the ALI Sub chapter C report in its Federal Income Tax Project, analyzed existing tax treatment of corporate earnings as creating (1) a bias in favor of debt and (2) a bias in favor of equity capital raised by retention of earnings.95 The proposal's effect on the equity-debt choice, the first bias, has been discussed supra. The proposal will eliminate most of the second bias pinpointed by Professor Andrews. Except for earnings that escape tax at the corporate level because of tax preferences, retained earnings will be taxed at least as heavily under the proposal as distributed earnings. By redressing this bias to the fullest extent possible without addressing the merits of the tax preferences, the proposal will make it easier for new or growing corporations to finance capital expansion. The present bias heavily favors established corporations that already have earnings bases generating re tained earnings. 95Tax Project, supra note 11, at 356. Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="33">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 33 Although the proposal will reduce substantially the present discrimination against investing in C corporations, as contrasted with S corporations, partner ships, or proprietorships, it will by no means eliminate all differences because it does not allow pass-through of all tax preference deductions and incentive tax credits. That is not its objective. The proposal will also induce exempt organizations to shift their investments from corporate stock to corporate debt obligations. Under the proposal, the exempt organizations will lose their present advantage over individual investors who now are taxed on their dividends. Because dividend exclusion by share holders will make corporate stock a more attractive investment than debt obli gations for taxpayers, the price of corporate stock will rise and the price of corporate bonds and other debt obligations will drop. As a result, exempt or ganizations that are not taxed on either dividends or interest will tend to shift their investments to debt obligations yielding interest that would be taxed if received by other investors. Conversely, high-bracket individual taxpayers will tend to shift their invest ments from debt obligations yielding taxable interest to stocks with excluded dividends. Overall, there is likely to be greatly increased demand for stock in C corporations. Any drastic change in the application of the income tax will affect persons who already have positioned themselves under the prior law. The effect may be a windfall gain, or it may be an unanticipated loss. The proposal will result in windfall gains to existing shareholders who were satisfied to invest in stocks at their present prices in spite of an expected double tax on any dividend income, The extent of the windfall will depend upon the system adopted for ordering distributions from earnings and profits. If dividends are considered to be first from the most recently earned taxable income the windfall will be substantial. On the other hand, if dividends are considered to be first from the earliest accumulations, the effect of the proposal on corporations that already have substantial accumulated earnings will be postponed, in some instances for many years. After taking into account the time value of money, the windfall gain in the value of stock of a corporation with a large accumulated earnings and profit account would be slight under a system of ordering distributions from the earliest accumulated earnings first. In either event, the prospect of windfalls (or unan ticipated losses) should not preclude income tax revisions that are desired. Oth erwise, we will be locked into our present system with no prospect for improvement. The revenue cost of the proposal will be significantly lower than the cost of other systems for complete elimination of double taxation of dividends. First, there will be a substantial offset to the dividend exclusion cost from taxing all corporate income at a flat rate equal to the maximum individual rate, thus eliminating the present income-splitting opportunities open to the owners of closely held corporations. Second, if the exclusion for dividends from existing corporations is postponed until after their earnings accumulated before the effective date have been dis tributed, the initial cost of the dividend exclusion will be quite low. In fact, Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="34">34 SECTION OF TAXATION with that ordering of distributions, when combined with the proposed flat cor porate tax rate, the overall result in the early years probably would be a net revenue increase. Third, unlike a system of corporate deduction of dividends, the proposal does not involve a revenue loss with respect to dividends paid to individuals who are not subject to income tax or dividends paid to tax-exempt organizations. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that the revenue cost of a system of shareholder credits for corporate tax paid on dividends would be increased approximately 50% by extending its benefits to tax-exempt share holders.96 Admittedly, in the long run the tendency for exempt organizations to shift their investment portfolios from stocks to interest-bearing obligations would diminish, over a period of years, the revenue cost advantage of a system of dividend relief that does not benefit exempt organizations. If this is considered a serious problem, consideration could be given to extending the tax on interest earned by exempt social clubs to include the other exempt organizations as well.97 Fourth, under the proposal there would be little revenue loss with respect to dividends paid to nonresident aliens who pay little or no United States income tax now because of reduced treaty rates. For example, French portfolio investors are now taxed at a rate of only 15% on dividends paid by United States cor porations.98 In contrast, a dividend deduction system would result in loss of the full corporate tax on such dividend amounts, unless coupled with some recoup ment device. The Treasury's dividend deduction plan would be supplemented by a compensatory withholding tax on foreign shareholders who are not entitled to tax treaty benefits,99 but that still would leave a revenue loss with respect to shareholders in treaty countries. Fifth, the proposal will produce a smaller revenue loss than either a corporate deduction system or a shareholder grossed-up credit system because the proposal does not give shareholders in low tax brackets a credit to offset tax on income from other sources; nor does it give a dividend-paying corporation a deduction that will result in a tax saving by the corporation in excess of the tax paid on the dividend by the individual shareholder. X. CONCLUSION The present system of taxing corporate income at the corporate level and again at the shareholder level when dividends are paid is unfair; it misallocates the economy's resources and it generates intractable administrative problems for the Service. Among the alternatives for correcting the situation, full integration must be rejected on administrative grounds. If it were possible to administer, full integration would be wrong in principle because it ignores the role of the publicly held corporation as a viable taxable entity in its own right. 96Report, supra note 8, at 12. 91See I.R.C. ? 512(a)(3). 9SSee Income Tax Treaty Between France and the United States, July 28, 1967, Art. 9(2)(a), P-H Tax Treaties 11 38,101. "Treasury Report, supra note 4, at 119. Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="35">ELIMINATING DOUBLE TAXATION OF CORPORATE DIVIDENDS 35 Rejecting full integration, there are three approaches to eliminating double taxation on the dividend component of corporate income. These should be judged by a standard of how effective they are in correcting the flaws in the present system, not by how close they come to achieving the results of full integration. Fairness, improvement in economic allocation of resources, improvement in administration, and revenue cost are the standards by which any plan to eliminate the double tax on dividends should be judged. One approach is to allow corporations to deduct dividends paid. It has the serious flaw of making the tax consequences of dividend deduction the dominant factor in the decision to declare dividends instead of retaining earnings. The consequent misallocation of investment funds would be as serious as the present misallocation because the second tax on shareholders is the dominant factor now in the decision to retain earnings instead of declaring dividends. Another approach is to have shareholders gross up dividends by the corporate tax attributable to the earnings distributed as dividends and give the shareholders tax credit for that corporate tax. Because this system is not conditioned on the corporate tax rate being made the same as the maximum individual tax rate, it does not do away with the need for an accumulated earnings tax and a personal holding company tax. Either the gross-up rate and the amount of credit will vary from corporation to corporation, with difficult problems of administration as a consequence, or the system must assume that corporate tax has been paid at the nominal rate on all earnings from which dividends are paid. The latter alternative would result in high revenue cost and some shareholders getting a credit in excess of actual corporate tax paid. Both of the foregoing approaches would substitute the individual shareholder's tax rate for the corporate rate. Although this is consistent with partial integration, if one rejects integration on the grounds that it is appropriate for corporate earnings to bear full corporate tax, both of the foregoing approaches are flawed because they would undertax corporate income flowing through to shareholders who are subject to tax rates below the corporate rate. As a further consequence, of course, both of the foregoing approaches would have higher revenue costs than the proposal made here. The approach used in this proposal is to start with a corporate tax on corporate earnings and eliminate double taxation by excluding dividends at the shareholder level. It will correct the present unfairness to shareholders by eliminating the second tax, but only if full tax has been paid at the corporate level. The proposal will remove the present tax bias against investment by individuals in publicly held corporations and against distribution of dividends as compared to corporate reinvestment of earnings. It will significantly reduce the present tax bias in favor of debt financing and of the acquisition of corporations by other corporations. Finally, the proposal will ease the Service's problems in administering the income tax in a number of respects. First, it will relieve the Service of the nearly impossible task of administering the accumulated earnings tax. Second, it will obviate the need for a personal holding company tax. Third, it will remove most of the pressure by Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page><page sequence="36">36 SECTION OF TAXATION owners of closely held corporations to disguise equity investment as debt. Fourth, it will relieve the Service from policing stock redemptions by which shareholders attempt to draw down funds from corporate solution at the price of capital gains tax. These gains in simplicity will more that offset the added complexity of main taining a previously taxed income account. The approach developed in this proposal has heretofore not received the con sideration it deserves. The detailed proposal in this article demonstrates that the approach is practical and has a sound theoretical basis. Consequently, dividend exclusion should be considered a feasible alternative in the choice among methods of ending double taxation of dividends. Tax Lawyer, Vol. 39, No. 1</page></plain_text>
