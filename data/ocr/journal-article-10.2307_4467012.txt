<plain_text><page sequence="1">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent in Judaism by Mordecai Roshwald Thy name shall be called . . . Israel: for thou hast contended with God and with men (Genesis 32:29) Authority, suggests Hannah Arendt, both etymologically and institution- ally is a distinctive Roman concept. It must not be confused with coercion: "where force is used, authority itself has failed." Nor is it the product of per- suasion: "where arguments are used, authority is left in abeyance."' Authority involves the acceptance of a hierarchical order as right and legitimate by those who command and by those who obey. Each of the parties in this order accepts his place and his function willingly. The justification for the acceptance of the authoritarian order- as seen by those who accept it-is respect for the ances- tors and the past: The authority of the living was always derivative . . . upon the authority of the founders, who no longer were among the living. Authority, in contradistinction to power [potestas], had its roots in the past. . . . Thus precedents, the deeds of the ancestors and the usage that grew out of them, were always binding. ... Tradition preserved the past by handing down from one generation to the next the testimony of the ancestors, who first had witnessed and created the sacred founding and then augmented it by their authority throughout the cen- turies. [Hannah Arendt reminds us that auctoritas is derived from augere, to augment.] ... to act without authority and tradition, without accepted, time-honored standards and models, without the help of the wisdom of the founding fathers, was inconceivable.2 If the notion of authority is removed from its peculiar Roman setting and defined in a more general manner, one would say, along with accepted defini- tions, that authority is the power or the right to enforce obedience, or the pos- sessor of such a power or right.3 To adjust this definition to the main currents of the history of political thought (exemplified in Hannah Arendt's analysis), one may be well advised to drop the principle of power from this definition, or to relegate it to a secondary place. Authority would thus be the right to de- 189</page><page sequence="2">190 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES mand or enforce obedience, or a rightful source of power, which, of course, also implies an obligation on the part of those subject to this power. Authority in this broader sense could be, and in fact often has been, justified in terms other than veneration for ancestors, tradition and precedent. One cardinal manner in which authority has been justified is closely associated with the social contract theories, i.e., with the principle of consent. The fundamental idea was expressed clearly and succinctly by Rousseau when he proclaimed that "Since no man has natural authority over his fellows, and since Might can produce no Right, the only foundation left for legitimate au- thority in human societies is Agreement."4 It is outside the scope of the present study to investigate the long and intricate history of the idea of agreement as the foundation of authority. It is sufficient for our purpose to state that the agreement in question naturally involves the element of will -indeed, free will -of its makers, and that this agreement is assumed to take the form of a con- tract (explicit or tacit) which is usually considered binding (though sometimes subject to important qualifying conditions). In other words, the assumption underlying this line of thinking is that free agreement of those who obey is the ultimate reason for submitting to the will of those who command and gives the latter the sanction to exact such obedience. The agreement being of a contrac- tual nature, it involves an a priori commitment on the part of the contracting individuals. Another way of reasoning justifies authority when and because it follows the objective truth or aims at an ethically desirable goal. In the words of Socrates, "[a man] ought only to consider whether in doing anything he is do- ing right or wrong"5 and this principle of individual ethics is transmitted into the realm of Plato's politics which enthrones the philosopher, one who knows the ultimate Truth (and Right), over the ideal State.6 It is the philosopher's knowledge of what is true (and beautiful and right) that gives him the authori- ty to rule. This line of thinking, besides subjecting authority to the extra- political spheres of metaphysics and ethics, also relates authority to reason and rational argument, the means for discovering truth and right. This is in clear contrast to Hannah Arendt's exclusion of arguments from the (narrow) defini- tion of authority. Needless to say, justification of authority in terms of right and truth and through resorting to argument has in no way been the exclusive approach of Plato or of ancient Greeks, but has formed an important element in the history of political ideas. While the word "authority" has no equivalent in biblical Hebrew- the closest, though not quite exact approximation, samkhut, being a later word-the idea of authority is very clearly expressed in the Bible. When, for example, Moses interferes with the striving Hebrews, and gets the responses "Who made thee [literally, "put thee"] a prince and a judge over us?" (Exodus</page><page sequence="3">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 191 2:14), the idea clearly conveyed is: "Who gave you authority over us?" The obvious, implicit and explicit, authority of the Israelites in the bibli- cal narrative is God. When the Lord says to Abraham, the father of the future nation, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fa- ther's house, unto a land that I will shew thee" (Genesis 12:1), this decisive step in Abraham's life and Israel's destiny is taken without question. The divine au- thority over Israel is implied when God tells Moses to announce to the children of Israel that "The Lord God of your fathers . .. hath sent me unto you" (Exo- dus 3:15). The idea of the divine authority, expressed in political terms, is reit- erated in Gideon's refusal of kingship and his assertion to the men of Israel that "the Lord shall rule over you" (Judges 8:23). The eventual kings of Israel are chosen by God - "See ye whom the Lord hath chosen" (I Samuel 10:24)- and retain their authority over Israel because of divine choice and only as long as God approves of them. The criticism of and opposition to the king is expressed by the prophet in the name of God. Significantly, in the postbiblical jurisprudential and historical notions of the Mishnah the principle of the divine source of the legal authority is clearly evident: "Moses received the Torah at [literally, from] Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua, Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets, and the proph- ets to the men of the Great Synagogue."7 The unbroken chain of transmis- sion continues through institutional and concrete human channels. This philosophy of the divine origin of Law-both Written and Oral - has served as the fundamental notion of traditional Judaism through the ages. On the face of it, the Israelite and Jewish concept of authority has some striking resemblance to the Roman auctoritas, as interpreted by Hannah Arendt. Judaism too stresses the venerable "fathers" and other prominent figures of the past, as well as the element of historical continuity. Judaism also looks backward for the fundamental source of authority, and in the conception of rabbinical Judaism, the earlier legal source has precedence over a later tra- dition or interpretation. Yet, the resemblance, though indicating a kind of common conservatism, fails to take notice of some profound differences. The authority in Judaism is conceived as divine - and therefore entailing what is absolutely right. However venerable the ancestors may be, they remain human and, one can well assume, had they not been backed by God's word, their pronouncements could have been questioned by later generations. The reason their word is haloed with au- thority is not simply their antiquity but their temporal proximity to divine rev- elations at Sinai which, of course, they are trusted to convey truthfully. That revelation was absolute and complete and therefore it cannot be augmented, as in the case of the Roman authority. Thus the function of the succeeding generations of venerable ancestors (whether elders, prophets, men of the Great</page><page sequence="4">192 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES Synagogue, heads of the Sanhedrin and so on) is nothing more than receiving the Torah and transmitting it to the next generation. The Hebrew verbs kab- bel and massor, used (in the original) in the above quotation from the Mishnah, convey the notion of a mechanical process-in no way a process of enlargement or development. Significantly, the word kabbalah, the substan- tival form of kabbel, denotes, in the rabbinical usage, the transmitted tradi- tion, and thus the Oral Law. (To be sure, an "external" student of Judaism will regard the Talmudic law as an extension, elaboration, augmentation and even modification of the Pentateuch; but from the "internal" point of view of rab- binical Judaism, the vast body of the Talmudic law remains the interpretation of the Written Law of the Torah and the transmission and interpretation of the Oral Law, also believed to have been given by God to Moses at Sinai.) This notion of the divine nature of authority precludes the intrinsic respect for precedent which is inherent to the Roman conception of authority. Precedent in Judaism carries weight only in as much as it involves a correct judgment by those who were closer to the miraculous event of divine revelation -and there- fore implicitly trusted to have preserved the revealed truth. The authority of God is conveyed through the elaborately detailed Law. This comprehensive legal system is termed in Hebrew Halakhah, a word with- out a precise English equivalent. Halakhah, in distinction from hok (law in the strict sense), is derived from the verb halakh, meaning to go or to walk. Halakhah seems to imply the notion of law as indicating and precisely prescrib- ing which way to walk. Indeed, the Halakhah prohibits or prescribes the cor- rect way of life for the Jew in regard to almost every step in his daily life. It deals with matters which today may be distinguished as legal, moral, religious, or ritualistic, but which all form a unity, divinely ordained, for the devout and observant. While the Halakhah originates in and derives its authority from the commandments of God, it has been elaborated, interpreted, resolved, and even provided with siagim - precautionary additional regulations-by many generations of rabbinical scholars. Thus, it became humanized: it is the Law of God brought down to earth and made closer to man by the willing and ac- tive-indeed, devout- participation of man. If Kantian terminology were ap- plied to it, one would say that the heteronomous Law of God turned autono- mous through the willing concern of scholars and ordinary Jews throughout centuries. Put differently, it could be concluded that while, strictly speaking, God uses Law to command His ways to His people, psychologically the Law, in its expression as Halakhah, itself turns into the immediate source of authority -an authority lovingly elaborated and submitted to by the people and its sages. Philosophically, Halakhah is a means for expressing and applying to each circumstance God's will and authority; emotionally, it becomes authority itself; authority in which God and man are, as it were, partners.</page><page sequence="5">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 193 In the biblical stories, God's authority is perceived not only in relationship to Law, but also in His dramatic interference in human and national affairs. It is either direct--as, for example, in many of the stories of the exodus from Egypt-or indirect, when the Lord permeates a human being with His spirit and thus exercises His authority. Thus, God takes from the spirit which is upon Moses and puts it on the elders (Numbers 11:17) and it is obvious that this is the spirit of the Lord (see Numbers 11:29). The Spirit of the Lord comes upon Othniel (Judges 3:10), Jephtah (11:29), Samson (14:6 et seq.), Saul, the first king of Israel (I Samuel 10:10 and 11:6) and David (16:13). "And the spirit of the Lord shall rest" also comes upon the eschatological deliverer in the famous prophecy of Isaiah (11:2). While the spirit of the Lord may imply strength and power in one case (Samson), and wisdom and insight in another, essentially it combines right and might, auctoritas and potestas--precisely because in God they are inseparable. Also, as intimated above, divine authority, unlike the Roman one, is not sought and it does not evolve, but is actively expressed, either by God's direct interference, or by His spirit resting on people or institu- tions of His choice. A peculiarity of the Judaic notion of authority is that it combines a histori- cal and a theological approach. The historical perspective--going back to the occurrence at Sinai and beyond it to the encounters of the fathers with God, as well as the notion of the continuity of tradition -makes it resemble the Roman approach, which is purely historical in its insistence on the origins of authority and its increase through the ages. However, the notion of the absolute author- ity of God, completely revealed in a single instance (at Sinai), sweeps away the historical development with a divine fiat. It seems to make all successive gen- erations shrink back into one decisive moment which envelops the future. Or, at least, this notion of absolute authority allows God to select His moments of interference with the flow of events--moments which are unevenly scattered between the revelations in the distant past and the eschatological future. Needless to say, this seemingly paradoxical combination of history and theolo- gy is typical of Judaism in that the Lord Himself, unlike the Aristotelian God, reveals Himself in history and actively participates in it. It would seem that the divine nature of authority in Judaism would pre- clude any element of human will--the foundation of authority in the prom- inent political-philosophical trend exemplified by Rousseau. Curiously enough, this is not the case. Despite the omnipotence, omniscience and the rectitude of God, His authority over Israel is not merely and simply the result of His good will, grace, or act of imposition on the "chosen people." This authority involves an act of will on their part as well. The element of human will as an essential ingredient in the establishment of authority over man is already adumbrated in God's address to Abraham,</page><page sequence="6">194 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES "Get thee out of thy country . . . unto a land that I will shew thee" (Genesis 12:1). For though, as already noted, Abraham follows the command without questioning the authority of God, God finds it necessary to support His com- mand by a promise that He will make of Abraham a great nation, bless him and make his name great (12:2). In other words, God tries to persuade Abra- ham to follow His order, which might be construed to imply that Abraham's consent is an element in the establishment of God's authority over him. Similarly, when Moses is reluctant to go to Pharaoh and bring out the children of Israel and God says that He will be with him (Exodus 3:10-12), both the reluctance of Moses and the reassurance of God may be taken as an evidence that the consent of the former is an ingredient in the authority of the latter. The sanctification of Jeremiah for prophecy strikes a similar note and is another example (Jeremiah 1:5-8). The element of human will, or consent, as an essential element in the es- tablishment of divine authority is even more clearly expressed in the notion of the Covenant- brt, in the original Hebrew. The meaning of brit is a mutually obliging commitment or agreement, which usually implies an act of will on both sides. God makes a covenant with Abraham on two occasions (Genesis, Chaps. 15 and 17), which symbolizes the relationship between God and the Israelites. Even more significant-as an illustration of our point-is the cov- enant made between God and the assembled tribes of Israel in Sinai, with Moses serving as the intermediary between the two parties to the agreement. God promises that if the children of Israel keep His covenant, they will be "a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation" (Exodus 19:6). The people of Israel answer: "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do" (19:8). Here the element of consent on the part of the people is explicitly stated, as it is in another account of the covenant between God and Israel: "And he [Moses] took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient" (Exodus 24:7). The covenant is between God and the people of Israel, each side con- ceived, to use modern terms, as a legal person, with a constant identity main- tained through the ages. Therefore, the covenant is binding for future genera- tions (e.g., Deuteronomy 4:31, Chap. 29; Joshua 23:15-16; Isaiah 24:5). In this sense, the element of consent in the biblical covenant lies outside the uni- verse of discourse of modern democratic notions which insist on a periodical and frequent consent of the ruled as the basis for the authority of the rulers. Nonetheless, the element of consent in the covenant with God is further stressed by renewals of the covenant, meant to assure adherence to it by the people of Israel. Thus, the covenant of Horeb (or Sinai) is followed by a cov- enant in the land of Moab (Deuteronomy 29:1) and the commitment to abide by the agreement is repeated on the initiative of Joshua before his death</page><page sequence="7">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 195 (Joshua, Chap. 24). Significantly, on this occasion too the people emphatically announce: "The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey" (verse 24). The resorting to an agreement by the people as a means for strengthening the authority of the divine law is echoed in Nehemiah, where such a covenant8 is solemnly entered into and sealed by the notables. (Nehemiah, Chap. 10. In the English version of the Bible the last verse of the preceding Chap. 9 is the beginning of the story.) The authority of God in Judaism is supported by yet another principle, namely, the belief that God and His commandments are just and true. The rule of God in Judaism is, in a sense, parallel to the rule of the Platonic philosopher-king; indeed, it accomplishes the absolute for which the philoso- pher is only reaching.9 That God is just as well as omnipotent is a fundamental tenet of Judaism, expressed implicitly and explicitly in biblical and rabbinical literature, and in Jewish philosophy and liturgy. The point is too obvious to re- quire an elaborate documentation, but a minimal illustration from the biblical text may be allowed. In such a central text as the Song of Moses, God is described as being "without iniquity, just and right is he" (Deuteronomy 32:4). The Psalmist de- clares: "The Lord is righteous in all his ways" (Psalm 145:17). The righteousness of God is inextricably bound with the Torah -His teaching, laws and moral precepts given to the children of Israel - the observance of which is the condition of God's continued concern for Israel. The connection between God and the Torah, profusely expressed in the Pentateuch, is succinctly summed up in Nehemiah: "Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true doctrines ['laws', in King James version], good statutes and commandments" (Nehemiah 9:13). If the essence of divine rule over Israel is the imposition of right laws and just commandments, it may well be concluded that a major fac- tor in the acceptance of divine authority is the moral excellence of God and His teaching. Inversely, other gods are rejected not only because they are false gods, but also because their cult involves abominable practices, such as human sacrifice (e.g., Deuteronomy 12:30-31; 18:9-10; 2 Kings, Chap. 21). Justice and right are crucial to the acceptance of divine authority. Indeed, if one ap- plied to Judaism the Socratic question whether the just is beloved by God because it is just, or whether it is just because it is beloved by God,10 the first alternative would have to be chosen. Even the Almighty has to accept what is absolutely right, for justice cannot be conceived as His arbitrary will. Justice forms a basic element in God's authority, yet it is not the expression of an incomprehensible and mysterious will of God. For though some of the ways of God--including the ways in which justice is implemented--may be viewed as wondrous and mysterious (e.g., Job 42:3), the basic issues of right</page><page sequence="8">196 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES and justice are open to human reasoning and to rational argument. Indeed, in the Jewish tradition, God Himself presents the issues of justice as open to human intelligence. Having decided to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for their sins, God takes Abraham into His confidence: "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" (Genesis 18:17). The friends of Job, who consistently take the pious position, are frowned upon by God for not speaking to Him in a true and sincere way as Job did (Job 42:7)." Evidently, subservience and flat- tery, rather than expression of an honest opinion in matters of right and wrong, is deemed wrong. Significantly, the postbiblical legend likes to express the non-authoritarian nature of God in various stories. Thus, God is said to have held argumentative discussions with Moses on various occasions, such as the quest of the Israelites for flesh, the golden calf incident and others.'2 The intelligent human participation in the acceptance of divine authority is also indicated in the concept of the Torah. Torah is usually translated as "law" and it occasionally has this meaning in the Bible (e.g., Exodus 12:49). However, the basic meaning of the word is "doctrine" or "teaching" and it en- compasses the total teaching of God which includes laws, morals and ritual.13 Therefore, to give but one biblical example, the right translation of the follow- ing verse from the famed passage in Isaiah should read: ". .. for out of Zion shall go forth the teaching [not 'the law'], and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" (Isaiah 2:3). Similarly, when the Mishnah, quoted above, asserts that "Moses received the Torah at Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua" and so on, the idea is not merely the reception and transmission of law, but also that of the comprehensive divine teaching (including law), which has to be studied, understood and interpreted, as the long rabbinical tradition testifies by its practice. To be sure, the teaching of God is conceived as final and complete and not to be modified or augmented; but it is not a set of commandments ac- cepted blindly. It has to be analyzed, discussed, and comprehended. "Thou shalt meditate therein [in the book of the Torah] day and night," says the Lord to Joshua (Joshua 1:8). Human intelligence participates in the acceptance of God's authority, just as a learner's mind must be included in the absorption of teaching. Thus, it would seem, the Judaic notion of authority shares with the Greek philosophy not only the element of the need for moral justification of author- ity, but also the related principle of rational argument. Despite the similarity, the differences should not be ignored. In the Greek approach, the rational ef- fort is more comprehensive and fundamental: it encompasses the problems of Truth and of Right, of metaphysics and ethics; it explores the nature of reality in a philosophical manner and it reaches practical conclusions based on the philosophical theories. In Judaism, the nature of reality, the philosophical and metaphysical foundations, are given in the notion of God, the creator of the</page><page sequence="9">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 197 universe and its sustainer, watcher and manipulator. These foundations are not questioned in the Bible and in the mainstream of the Judaic tradition. It is essentially the issues of Right to which human intelligence addresses itself. Typically, Adam ate of "the tree of knowledge of good and evil." While this self-limitation of mental curiosity might seem as narrowing the human interests of Judaism, and while the notion of the justice of divine teaching would leave room only for interpretations, the results of these limita- tions proved much less restrictive. For what Judaism abandoned in scope -by focusing on ethical issues--it made up by the passionate concern for justice. The application of human intelligence and judgment to issues of morals made Judaism go beyond pious interpretations of divine order and doctrine and even prompted it to challenge some of the metaphysical assumptions on the nature of God in the name of a passionate quest for the right. Thus, the religious belief, however strong, became open to questions and doubts, to a searching and often painful skepticism. This skepticism has been a formidable trait in Judaism through the ages. 2 Skepticism is derived from the Greek word skeptesthai, to examine. Ex- amination is preceded by a doubt, for one does not examine that about which one is absolutely certain. Examination may be also followed by doubt, if the thing examined is not up to our expectations. Skepticism, in the sense of ques- tioning a religious doctrine--a meaning pertinent to this study--entails this combination of examination and doubt. The doubts concerning God, or the benevolent rule of God, can have dif- ferent degrees of intensity and may be expressed in various forms. It may be just an implied questioning and it may be an outright accusation. It may be formulated in a philosophical argument, story, or poetic outpour. In Judaism, examples of a diversity of form and a variation of degree in the skeptical streak which runs throughout its history can be found. The following, culled from various epochs and diverse sources, will illustrate this point. They are also in- tended to present a survey of the skeptical trend in Judaism - a survey less than complete but more than sketchy. The questioning of divine justice is well exemplified already in the Bible which, as in many other instances, sets the tone for the subsequent develop- ment of ideas and attitudes in Judaism. One case of a restrained, yet profound, questioning is the story of Abraham pleading for Sodom and Gomorrah, as told in Genesis 18:17-33, especially verses 23-32. Two elements can be dis- cerned in Abraham's plea. One is the entreaty to pardon the entire city for the sake of a number of righteous men who may dwell in it: "Peradventure there</page><page sequence="10">198 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the [sake of the ] fifty righteous that are therein?" (verse 24). However, the principle that the righteousness of a few people may atone for the wickedness of the many others, seemingly implied in this argument and in God's positive answer (verse 26), is not clearly developed. Conceivably, the assumption of Abraham is that in the destruction of the place all the people would perish and therefore the city has to be spared to save the righteous, whose well-being is the only consideration (though verse 28 would not support this interpretation). The other element in Abraham's plea, unequivocally stated and of primary in- terest to us, is the argument for moral justice: the righteous person must not suffer calamity because a wicked man is being punished. This is the opening of Abraham's address to God and it sets the tone for the dialogue that follows: "Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?" (verse 23). This argu- ment is vigorously reiterated a few lines later: "That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?" (verse 25). The basic assumption contained in this ar- gument-and fundamental to the philosophy of the Bible--is that righteous deeds entitle a person to expect a compensation (at least in the form of absence of calamity) and it is God's responsibility to assure this relationship between an individual's deeds and his fortunes. This is justice, whereas equating the for- tunes of the righteous and the wicked is iniquity. Not less interesting than the substance of the argument is the tone of the dialogue. Abraham oscillates between fear of the Almighty and moral fervor which makes him overcome this fear. The fear is the apparent reason for start- ing with fifty righteous--a sizable number--and decreasing gradually and cautiously to ten righteous as a number justifying God's sparing the sinful cities. This fear is also expressed directly by Abraham when he stresses his own worthlessness, or perhaps weakness as "[I] am but dust and ashes " (verse 27), or "Oh let not the Lord be angry" (verses 30 and 32). Yet, the idea of a possible iniquity not only prompts Abraham to speak to God, but also sustains him throughout the talk and gives him the strength to haggle about the price of pardon until he reaches the ten righteous and gets divine accord for it. It is Abraham's moral fervor which enables him to exclaim: "Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?" Behind the psychological oscillation between fear and audacity lies the metaphysical belief about the comparative natures of God and man. God is almighty and omnipotent, while man is weak and totally subject to God's power. Yet, when it comes to moral issues, man can comprehend these as well as God; man is God's equal in the understanding of ethical problems. Therefore, he can take issue with God whenever he becomes aware of a poten-</page><page sequence="11">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 199 tial iniquity. There can be a moral dialogue between man and God, though there can be no contest of power between the two because of the enormous discrepancy in strength. Besides the notion of equality of moral judgment, however, there also looms a suspicion: that God may not always be acting in the right way; that His moral judgment may sometimes be blunted, or simply ignored by Him. Other- wise, why would Abraham take the trouble and the risk of addressing God on the issue of His decision to take punitive action against Sodom and Gomorrah, and why would he moralize to Him? The same doubt about God's moral in- fallibility is implied by Moses and Aaron when, in response to God's decision to annihilate the entire congregation because of Korah's revolt, they exclaim: "O God, . . . shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wrath with all the congregation?" (Numbers 16:22). Significantly, in these, as in many other, if not all, cases of doubts about God's impeccability in the history of Judaism, the issue is not discussed between men, God being the subject of the controversy. The problem is raised directly with God Himself; the doubts are openly stated; and God, whenever He responds, does not resent the human quest for the moral perfection in Himself. Similar to a good schoolmaster, he lets the pupils ask the most penetrating questions; like a benevolent ruler, he patiently listens to the voices of sincere criticism and seems ready to accept it. As previously noted, the authority of God is not authoritarian in this sense; he seems to submit to the sweet voice of Reason, and to the strict demands of Justice. The question of divine justice is raised directly with God, in a virtually ac- cusing manner, by two prophets. Says Jeremiah: "Righteous art thou, O Lord, that I may complainT to you: Yet I will chide'5 you: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore do all they that deal very treacherously live in peace?" Jeremiah 12:1). The address is obviously paradoxical: Jeremiah as- serts that since God is being righteous, he, Jeremiah, cannot complain to Him about His conduct; yet, Jeremiah does precisely that. The paradox can be ex- plained in various ways. It may be thought to express the conflict, ambiva- lence, or the puzzlement felt by Jeremiah: he knows that God is righteous and therefore a grievance against Him is out of place; he also knows that iniquity exists and he cannot ignore it. On the other hand, although this would be atypical of Jeremiah, perhaps the opening statement is meant ironically: God is supposedly just, thus an argument with Him over justice would not make sense; however, as things really stand, there is ground enough to chide the Almighty. Whichever way we interpret Jeremiah's address to God, however, the concern about iniquity in the world and the complaint that God fails by tolerating such iniquity is clearly voiced here. Another prophet, Habakkuk, makes a quite similar accusation, though it is differently worded: "Thou art of purer eyes</page><page sequence="12">200 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and remainst silent16 when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?" (Habakkuk 1:13).17 Significantly, the skeptics in these instances are prophets, who were chosen by God to be His spokesmen. These are not doubts of heretics, or outsiders; these are doubts of those closest to God, and apparently these doubts are tolerated. Isaiah also voices doubts. They are of a more universal nature and more subtly put. The statement is not addressed to God as a complaint, but ap- parently expressed in His name. When Isaiah announced in his eschatological prophecy that "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid" (Isaiah 11:6-8), the implied dissatisfaction with the pre- sent state of affairs, in which the wolf preys on the lamb and the leopard de- vours the kid, is evident. To be sure, this implied criticism of the universe need not be typical of the Bible; it sharply contrasts with the more prevalent idea that the universe created and sustained by God is perfect -an idea expressed, for example, in Psalm 104. Yet Isaiah's vision of a morally-guided, peaceful and harmonious world, with the implied disapproval of the present chaos and cruelty, cannot be ignored as a significant manifestation in the Bible. By far the fiercest expression of doubts about God's righteousness can be found in the book of Job. Here the thesis is stated openly that God is mighty and powerful--he "commandeth the sun . . . alone spreadeth out the heav- ens" (Job 9:7-8)-but remains indifferent to principles of justice: "He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked" (9:22). Indeed, God is not only unjust, but also shows petty vindictiveness toward the weak, short-lived creature called man: "Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He com- eth forth like a flower, and is cut down. .. . And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?" (14:1-3).18 While the postbiblical, rabbinical literature is, on the whole, less outspo- ken in casting doubts upon divine justice and God's moral perfection, it does provide examples of penetrating questioning and criticism. They are usually clothed in distinctive and characteristic garb, such as a reflective comment or an enlightening story linked to a biblical verse under the semblance of con- stituting a commentary-a so-called derash in Hebrew.19 A passage in the Midrash gives the following illustrative interpretation to a verse in Psalms, "The Lord trieth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth" (Psalm 11:15): "R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: When a flax worker knows that his flax is of good quality, the more he beats it the more it improves and the more it glistens; but if it is of inferior quality, he cannot give it one knock without its splitting. Similarly, the Lord does not test the wicked but only the righteous, as it says, 'The Lord trieth the righteous'. "20 While this interpretation ostensibly intends to explain the suffering of the</page><page sequence="13">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 201 righteous in a way which will exculpate God, it may well be read as an ironic comment on the Lord's perverted concern with those who are faithful to Him. If this reading of the parable may be questioned by the literal interpreters of rabbinical commentaries, the following example from the Talmud is a more direct evidence of doubts concerning divine justice. Addressing itself to the story in Exodus about God smiting the first-born in Egypt, the "technical" pro- visions for saving the Israelites-instructing them to stay indoors- become a subject of probing and lead to doubts about divine righteousness, or provide an occasion for voicing such doubts: R. Joseph learnt: What is the meaning of the verse, And none of you shall go out of the door of the house until the morning? [Exodus 12:22] Once permission has been granted to the Destroyer, he does not distinguish between righteous and wicked. Moreover, he even begins with the righteous at the very outset, as it says: And I will cut offfrom thee the righteous and the wicked [Ezekiel 21:8]. R. Joseph wept at this saying: So much are they [the right- eous] compared to nothing! But Abbaye said: This is for their advantage, as it is written, That the righteous is taken away from the evil to come [Isaiah 57:1].21 Obviously, the brunt of the complaint is not aimed at the blind efficiency of the divine Destroyer, who does not distinguish between the righteous and the wicked (Exodus 12:22-23), but at the overall moral indifference of God, who even victimizes the righteous first. The despondency of the morally concerned man, when reflecting on this state of affairs, is dramatized by R. Joseph weep- ing over the insignificance of the righteous: the emotional outburst underlines the bankruptcy of the intellectual argument. The consoling response of Abbaye, justifying the death of the righteous as a salvation from evil, remains a weak re- buttal, which can hardly dry R. Joseph's tears of despair. Another bitter comment on the iniquity ruling the world can be found in the following Talmudic passage: "For R. Gorion . . . said: When there are righteous men in the generation, the righteous are seized [by death] for the [sins of the] generation; when there are no righteous in a generation, school- children are seized for the generation."2 The statement must not be understood as acceptance of vicarious atonement, but as a sarcastic indictment of the moral chaos in the world: the righteous are the victims and, in their absence, those who could not have even sinned are sacrificed. Significantly, the Hebrew phrase used to describe these children is tinokot shel beit-rabban, that is to say, very young children (literally, babies) who are at school: their in- nocence of sin is combined with initiation into the study of Torah. Yet, this combination of purity and merit, far from saving them, makes them deliberate victims of iniquity. While these examples of rabbinical skepticism about the benevolent and just conduct of the universe are expressed in general terms, they may have</page><page sequence="14">202 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES often, if not always, been a response to the national calamities of the Jews at the hand of the Roman rulers and persecutors. There are also examples of skepticism in which the historical connection is quite explicit. Thus, in con- junction with a story about a blaspheming Titus desecrating the temple with impunity - a story symbolizing the national tragedy of the Jews and the tri- umph of the evil heathen Romans--the following comments are made about God: "Abba Hanan said: Who is a mighty one like unto thee, O Jah? [Psalm 89:9] Who is like Thee, mighty and hard,23 that Thou didst hear the blas- phemy and insults of that wicked man and keep silent? In the school of R. Ish- mael it was taught: Who is like thee among the gods [elim]? [Exodus 15:11] Who is like thee among the dumb ones [illemim]."24 Significantly, these harsh reactions come from two different sources. The second one is particularly sar- donic in that it uses a verse from the famed Hymn of the Sea, which praises the Lord for delivering His people from the pursuing Egyptians; by adding one Hebrew letter "mem," the "elim" (gods) are changed into the "illemim" (dumb ones), and the praise of the Lord turns into an outright accusation. The con- trast between the historical delivery and the present silence is a testimony to human disillusionment and even to divine betrayal. Of course, the disenchant- ment is more than historical, for the comment of R. Ishmael not only indicates the contrast between the past and the present, but it also points at the con- tradiction between the religiously expected salvation and the actual silence. Or, to combine the historical and the theological elements (as one ought to do in Judaism), the God that failed in history has also failed in the absolute sense. It is worth mentioning that the argument with the Almighty is not re- stricted to males. Thus, in a legend concerned with the afflictions of the Jews at the hands of the Chaldeans, when the first temple was destroyed, it is Rachel who confronts God. Significantly, she does so after the attempts of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses to awaken God's mercy have proved futile. Reminding the Almighty that she was not jealous of her sister Leah when she was substi- tuted for Rachel as Jacob's wife by Laban and that she, Rachel, did not expose her sister to shame, though she had known of the plot, she asks: "why shouldest Thou, a King Who liveth eternally and art merciful, be jealous of idolatry [of Israel] in which there is no reality, and exile my children and let them be slain by the sword ..." The Lord accepts the argument of Rachel and promises to restore Israel to their land.25 The legend is related in the Midrash to a beautiful passage in Jeremiah 31:15-16, in which, indeed, God makes the pro- mise to Rachel. However, while in the biblical text it is a desolate and weeping Rachel who awakens God's mercy, in the legend it is an arguing woman who, in fact, moralizes to God. It is noteworthy that even the pietistic movement of Hasidism, flowering in the 18th and 19th centuries in eastern Europe, is not free of altercations with</page><page sequence="15">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 203 the Almighty. The Hasidic rabbis, who in their ardent belief and ecstatic prayers resume direct communication with God, are capable of challenging Him for the sake of the people and in the name of justice. Thus, Rabbi Levi Isaac of Berdichev is reputed to have turned to the Al- mighty during a New Year prayer service and exclaimed aloud: "O Lord of the universe If you inscribe your people Israel in the book of life-well and good; for the saving of a soul [a life] sets aside Sabbath and holiday and you are al- lowed to write. However, if you do not, then I, Levi Isaac the Rabbi in Ber- dichev, forbid you the writing on New Year." Another address to God at- tributed to Rabbi Levi Isaac reads: "If you pass judgment on us which is not favourable, we, the righteous and the pious of the generation, shall pass a judgment annulling your judgment."26 If these stories may be interpreted not as accusations of the Almighty, but merely as an audacious pleading for the people, there is another outcry attri- buted to Rabbi Levi Isaac in which he points an accusing finger at God. On a Day of Atonement, when the congregation confesses their sins, "he suddenly closed the doors of the Ark, turned to the congregation, and cried: 'That's enough now. It's God's turn to confess His sins!' "27 Another Hasidic Rabbi, Aryeh Leib, nicknamed "the grandfather from Shpolle," is told to have assem- bled a rabbinical court during a famine and summoned the Almighty to ap- pear before it and give account for not feeding thousands of Jews and their families. 28 Needless to say, it is of no great significance to us whether these stories are literally true or whether they have been embellished and magnified in the Hasidic tradition. The main point is that they have been accepted by that tradition as authentic and tolerated as tales about saintly rabbis, not about de- viant skeptics or apostates. Argument with God remained permissible - at least to those closest to Him. It differs visibly in style and tone from comparable biblical dialogues. There is a touch of bantering here in which neither Abraham nor Job in- dulged. Rabbi Levi Isaac and Rabbi Aryeh Leib seem to be on more familiar terms with God than their biblical predecessors. And God Himself seems more human. In fact, it could be said that these Hasidic rabbis have treated God not merely in an anthropomorphic, but in Judeomorphic manner, when they demanded that He appear in a rabbinical court or confess His sins. Indeed, it appears that God becomes an ordinary Jew, while the rabbi retains the legal authority and permits or forbids Him to write on a holiday. Though, one may assume, these stories contain an amount of folk-humor, there is an element of serious philosophy in such jesting and this philosophy reasserts the moral judg- ment of man and the human questioning of God's ways. The half-bantering relationship with the Almighty, which is not devoid of</page><page sequence="16">204 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES pungent accusations and bitter sarcasm, is well expressed in the character of Tevye, the dairyman. He is the well-known hero of a series of stories by the Yiddish writer Sholom Aleichem (the pen name of Shalom Rabinowitz), writ- ten around the turn of the century.29 While Tevye is the creation of an artist, he is not simply a figment of imagination, but represents a type - a folksy, sim- ple, poor, Russian Jew of the period. Strictly orthodox in his daily observance and conceiving his daily life and chores in terms of his prayers, the Holy Scrip- tures and the religious tradition, he exhibits a distinctive philosophical inde- pendence which leads him into theological doubts and moral accusations di- rected toward God. It could be said that since some Hasidic rabbis dared to challenge the Almighty, the simple fellow -faithful to the egalitarian tradition that all Jews are the Lord's people -did not like to remain behind. One query which Tevye addresses to God, in his simple, direct, illustrative manner, concerns social justice: "Harken, my dear God, the compassionate and faithful, aren't you a kind of a long suffering God, a great God and a good God, charitable and just? So how is it that you should give away to one fellow everything and to another nothing, to one butter-rolls and to another the plague of the first-born?" The issue of justice transcends human relations and the questioning becomes even bolder when Tevye compares the lot of man with that of the Almighty Himself: "He is up there, in the heights, I say, and we are here, on earth - buried deep in the earth. . . "31 From here the transition to an outright accusation of the Almighty for His cruelty toward man is easy. Tevye's arguments are clearly reminiscent of Job: "O Lord of the universe, O Lord of the universel What are we, and what is our life? Who am I that you keep thinking about me, bear me in mind, and let no plague, blight or affliction pass me by"32 The question is extended from God- man relations to the inter-human sphere, which inevitably involves the Al- mighty as well: "Why should men embitter each other's life and their own, when they could live sweetly and happily? Is it possible that God has created man in order that he suffer in this world?"33 Typically, and in a way echoing Isaiah whose eschatology encompasses the entire living world, Tevye is also worried about his horse and God's indifference to its lot: "Lord of the universe, how cleverly You conduct Your little world. You have created Tevye and, on the other hand, You have created a horse, and both have the same fate in this world. ... A man has at least a mouth to talk, he can complain out loud, he can unburden his soul to another; but a horse, what about it?"34 Significantly, Tevye exhibits concern and charity toward a lower creature, which God does not seem to show toward man. Thus, by implication, man - or some men - ap- pear more charitable than God. The accusations against the Almighty have no trace of bantering, but echo, instead, tones of pathos, anger and revolt in the modern poetry revived</page><page sequence="17">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 205 by the Maskilim (writers of the "Enlightenment"period) and attaining perfec- tion in the works of Hayyim Nahman Bialik. Writing in Russia, shortly after the pogrom in Kishinev (April 1903), Bialik exclaims in his poem, "On the Slaughter": If there is justice -let it act nowl But, if after I perish from under the sky Will justice dawn- May His throne be wrecked for ever!35 In a somewhat later poem, "In the City of Killing," another resounding response to that tragedy, Bialik makes God Himself invoke His people to an act of revolt and blasphemy against Himself: And why do they supplicate Me? Speak unto them and let them thunder Let them raise a fist at Me and claim their insult, The insult of all the generations, from the earliest to the last one, And let them, with their first, smash up heaven and My throne.36 Though Bialik is concerned here more with the passivity of the victimized peo- ple than with the iniquity of God, his formulation of the argument-the paradox of God calling to a revolt against God--may well be the peak of the perennial argument of man against God in Judaism. A more recent Hebrew writer, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, whose writing is a modern monument to the tradition of Jewish orthodoxy, would not go into the fierce, metareligious accusations of Bialik. Nonetheless, and despite a deep commitment to piety, Agnon has his own critical and ironic remarks about the ways of God, which, of course, are part and parcel of the tradition of Judaism. Thus, Nuta, a Jewish wagon-driver, in Bridal Canopy, says that "the Almighty don't know to whom He should give [wealth] and to whom He shouldn't give."3" Although this seems to be a mild and fairly good-humored expression of skepticism, especially since it issues from the mouth of a simple fellow, the author makes a much more biting remark in another of his works, A Guest for the Night. Describing an impoverished Jewish town after the first World War, where even the silvery ornaments of the Torah scrolls were con- fiscated by the government for making implements of war, Agnon comments: "See how humble is the King who is the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, who said 'Mine is the silver and mine is the gold,' but has not left Himself even an ounce of silver to adorn His Torah."38 Even more telling than this sardonic remark, however, is the question of iniquity in this world which Agnon asks with open simplicity in another work, Temol Shilshom [Yesteryear]. The issue concerns a tragedy of an individual, dying from a dog's bites, which can also be considered as symbolic of the</page><page sequence="18">206 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES tragedy of the Jew. Asks a woman, "Why did [God] do it to our Itzikl?" And the particular question assumes larger dimensions: "Is there in the world a city holy and dear and nice like Jerusalem, and why does it suffer so many afflic- tions. ... Is there in the world a nation as worthy as Israel, and despite it we are beaten and chastised." Returning to the lot of the individual and his fami- ly, Agnon says that they should have had good, productive, decent lives- which were prevented by his death. The statement of fact is followed by a ques- tion - a question to which there is no answer - that reaches beyond skepticism, into the realm of despairing resignation. Says Agnon: "They have it easy, those who do not bother themselves with excessive reflections, either because of great innocence, or because of great wisdom; but whoever is neither very innocent nor very wise, what will he answer and what will he say?"39 3 It is evident that the questioning of authority in Judaism has often led to a skeptical attitude. Occasionally this skepticism has led to an open rejection of fundamental Jewish beliefs, which may or may not have been regarded as apostasy. Such cases will be called manifestations of dissent. The point requires some further clarification. This category will not in- clude a disagreement of a political nature, having possible religious overtones, such as the conflict over the report of the spies sent out by Moses to the Land of Canaan, or the dispute between the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel. Nor will it include differences of opinion on theological issues of a secondary nature which sometimes- as in the case of the Karaites--led to an open schism in Judaism. It is only cases of dissent focusing on central questions of belief, philosophical issues, rather than technical-theological or theopoliti- cal disputes, which are of concern here. For though a relatively minor spiritual disagreement may have occasionally led to major social and political conse- quences, it is the realm of spirit, belief and thought that is important to this discussion. It is the fundamental questions which lead to alienation toward the source of Judaic belief that will be explored. Such an alienation is, in a way, a continuation of skepticism. A skeptic who does not get a satisfactory answer to his probing may well become alienated and openly dissent from the doctrine. It could be argued that some of the cases of skepticism reported above, such as the poems of Bialik, or the outcries of Job, are, in fact, cases of dissent. Perhaps, it is all a matter of degree and then the demarcation between skeptics and dissenters becomes arbitrary. Even so, the highest degree of skepticism, which leads to an open rejection of fundamentals of religion or even actual abandonment of Judaism, requires a special examination, as the following examples will show.</page><page sequence="19">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 207 A word of caution may be indicated. The dissenters will not be followed into the various camps they may have joined. Dissenters from Judaism some- times became converts to other religions, or followers- and often leaders--of non-religious beliefs, such as Marxism and other ideologies. To follow these would be to enlarge the scope of this study beyond its basic framework. The cases of dissent presented here will deal with fundamental disagreement, par- ticularly those occurring within or on the fringe of Judaism. Even so, they will be limited to three significant examples, taken from diverse periods of Jewish history. The outstanding example of dissent in the Bible is the book of Ec- clesiastes. It goes beyond the fierce skepticism of Job, despite presenting its dissenting philosophy in a cool, dispassionate manner. It is no longer an argu- ment with God; God, as a benevolent and just ruler of the universe, has been relinquished, to give way to another view of the order of things and of man's destiny. The universe, far from being the purposeful and meaningful creation of God - as predicted in Genesis 1 or Psalm 104- appears senseless and dull: "All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full" (Ecclesiastes 1:7). "The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; . . . and there is no new thing under the sun" (verse 9). The universe may well have been created by God and it may be even advisable for man to fear God (5:6; 8:12), but this does not make the world any more comprehensible to man. For the order of the universe, even if divinely ordained, is not moral: the righteous may not be rewarded, nor the wicked punished (8:14). Indeed, the place of man within the order is of no significance: "For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; . . . as the one dieth, so dieth the other; for all is vanity" (3:19). Ecclesiastes explores the practical possibilities open to man, and considers such alternatives as down-to-earth hedonism (3:12-13), wisdom (2:13-14), or life with the woman one loves (9:9). Even this practical guidance, however, is full of doubt and misgiving: life of pleasure amounts to vanity (2:11), "in much wisdom is much grief' (1:8), and the woman is found to be "more bitter than death" (7:26). Thus, it would seem that man lives in an incomprehensible world, in which he can hardly find a sensible path for himself during his existence, and where the only solid conclusion left for him is that "all is vanity" (1:2). The dis- sent from the comprehensible, meaningful, just universe conducted by God, whose major concern is man and whose chosen nation is Israel, could hardly be more complete. The dissenting philosophy of Ecclesiastes remains anonymous and imper- sonal, despite the fact that the book is attributable to "the son of David, king in Jerusalem," that is to say, to Solomon, as the Jewish tradition affirms. The</page><page sequence="20">208 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES anonymity of the book is due not only to the doubt about its declared author- ship by biblical research--indeed, even its unity is questioned; but it also re- mains impersonal, even alien, because the argument does not seem to address itself to the central issues of Judaism, such as the problem of justice in the world conduct which dominated the thoughts of the various skeptics. The problem of justice is mentioned, but it is not focal; it is just one of the issues in which this world, and possibly God, fails. Had the book not been included in the Bible and written in Hebrew, it would be impossible to guess its cultural identity. Of course, these two conditions are present and so Ecclesiastes re- mains a testimony to a philosophical dissent in early Judaism. A somewhat later testimony- in this case connected with a historical, con- crete, personal case, and related to the focal problem of divine justice-is that of Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah. This tanna, or scholar of the period of the forma- tion of the Mishnah, lived in the first half of the 2nd century A.D. Elisha ben Abuyah was an important scholar in his own right, as well as the teacher of the prominent Rabbi Meir. Yet, according to the testimonies scattered in the Talmud, Elisha ben Abuyah openly discarded Judaism. Consequently, he is usually referred to in the Talmud as Aher--"a different one" or "a stranger," perhaps one might say, "the alienated." The open dissent from Judaism of a personality like this must have been a shocking event for his contemporaries. The extant explanations of his dissent relate it to fundamental theological and ethical issues. One such explanation suggests that Aher was one of four scholars who en- tered Pardes (i.e., Paradise or Garden)-which is usually interpreted as the realm of theosophy-and as a consequence of this experience he "mutilated the shoots" (a strong and figurative way to indicate his discarding of Judaism).40 In another story, it is not the strong potion of Jewish mysticism, but foreign influences, which are said to have been the cause of Elisha ben Abuyah's estrangement. There, it is alleged that "Greek song did not cease from his mouth," and "that when he used to rise [to go] from the schoolhouse, many heretical books used to fall from his lap."41 Whichever of the stories is true- and they may well be complementary- the emerging characteristics of Elisha ben Abuyah are those of a man unsatisfied with the trodden paths and with the customary interpretations of the Law, who was trying to fathom the basic principles and explore the fundamental tenets of faith. This impression is corroborated by two other stories which, however, focus on the moral aspects of Jewish belief, or, more precisely, on the morality of God's conduct of the world. Thus they relate Aher's dissent to the mainstream of skepticism in Judaism. One of these stories mentions Aher casually--per- haps with studied casualness-in connection with an interpretation of the passage in the Pentateuch in which one is exhorted not to take "the dam with</page><page sequence="21">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 209 the young" but to let the dam go and then take the young, "that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days" (Deuteronomy 22:6-7). The question arising in this connection is how to reconcile these verses with reality, specifically with a case in which a father sends his son to bring down the young birds and the son follows the commandment and first dismisses the dam, but on his return falls from the loft and is killed. Asks the Talmud: "where is this man's happiness and where is this man's prolonging of days?" It is in the con- text of this problem (which in itself is outside the scope of inquiry) that the case of Aher is mentioned: "Now, what happened with Aher? Some say, he saw something of this nature." Thus, the dissent of Elisha ben Abuyah is presented as the result of an experience which seems to have proved the words of the Torah untrue and also in a matter concerning the iniquitous fate of the pious and the righteous in this world, which is crucial to Judaic notion of a just God. The story, whether actual or not, is of symbolic value and may well have been so intended by its narrators. Significantly, however, it is immediately followed by another story-not directly connected with the Holy Scriptures, but bearing on the fundamental notions of the justness of God. This story, be- ing concerned with an historical event, has the distinctive qualities of authen- ticity, and thus adds concrete drama--indeed, tragedy- to the abstract reflec- tions engendered by the precursing episode. In the laconic language of the Talmud, this is just another version explaining Aher's dissent: "Others say, he saw the tongue of Huzpith the Interpreter dragged along by a swine. 'The mouth that uttered pearls licks the dust!' he exclaimed. [Thereupon] he went forth and sinned."42 Huzpith was one of the scholars martyred by the Romans following the failure of the Bar-Kokhba revolt. The fact that it was the Inter- preter, a person who interpreted the Torah to the people at public readings, who came to such an end, and that the tongue serving the word of God was to be dragged by an unclean animal, adds poignancy to the bitter disillusionment of Aher with God. The great national tragedy lurking behind this episode and reflected by it adds overwhelming proportions to the notion of God's neglect of His people and His indifference toward the basic principles of right. The dis- sent of Aher thus becomes a practical conclusion to questions asked before him and since, and the dissenter in this case is merely the skeptic who translated his thoughts into an act. A modern example of dissent is provided in the form of a work of fiction, a story by the Hebrew writer Mordecai Zeev Feierberg, entitled Le'an? [Whither?]. This story is chosen to represent modern dissent, because it articu- lated feelings and attitudes which many Jews in modern times must have expe- rienced and because these sentiments and reflections are expressed in modern, revived Hebrew. Thus, the ideas of dissent here are clearly related to the vitali- ty of Jewish culture and spring from its renewal. Not only the form, but also</page><page sequence="22">210 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES the substance of the story focuses on problems of Judaism - the perennial issues of God and man, God and Israel. Mordecai Zeev Feierberg was born in Russia in 1874 and died of consump- tion at the age of 24. His contribution to the modern Hebrew literature is re- garded as quite significant, despite his limited oeuvre. Le'an? is considered his major work and is autobiographical in essence, if not in external details. The story is about a young man, the son of a distinguished rabbi, who, after a tor- tuous quest for an answer to the problem of divine concern with man and with the Jewish people, turns into an atheist. In a moment of despair, he puts out a candle in the synagogue on the Day of Atonement and from then on is declared to be insane and nicknamed "the crazy Nahman." The open revolt of Nahman and the extinguishing of the candle in the synagogue have not only a dramatic effect in the story, but also a symbolic meaning. The burning candle seems to represent the Jewish religious tradition which Nahman discards by extinguishing the candle. The reasons which lead him to this conclusion and this act form the substance of the story and need not be elaborated here except for a few fragments, which are especially pertinent to our inquiry. In an argument reminiscent of Job, Nahman muses: "Great are you O God, great and fearful indeed! And you, the terrible and fearful deity, the powerful and the mighty, whose capacity and might have no limit, you thus punish this tiny, weak and miserable man!"43 Nahman's main concern, however, is not about God's failure to show charity to man and sinner, but the terrible lot which has befallen the Jews through their history, despite or even because of their devotion to their religion and way of life. Seeing in his vivid imagination the suffering of the innocent martyrs during the destruction of Jersualem, "a frightening idea occurs to him: 'Who knows whether also then, on that terrible night, the moon did not watch with placid face the burning Temple and city? . . . Perhaps then too the stars were shining and illuminating the red ponds of blood? . . . Perhaps the whole thing is merely a joke . . .' "44 These reflections lead to a final break with tradition and clearcut dissent: And one night . .. he added up all his thoughts of the last two years; . . . then it suddenly became clear to him that unwillingly and unwittingly he had turned into a different man [aher, in the Hebrew text] and his heart and brain were not under his command anymore. ... And rising from his bed in the morning, he knew that he rose without God. ... On that day he did not pray, he did not put on philacteries, he did not recite shema and he did not say grace.45 On the face of it the reflections of Nahman, alias Feierberg, are not novel. One hears the echoes of Job; one follows the old bitter arguments of a martyred nation to the God who deserted it; and the dissent even has an apparently con-</page><page sequence="23">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 211 scious allusion to Aher. The apparent absence of originality is almost unavoid- able. For the arguments against God are limited in number and the continua- tion of suffering and martyrdom cannot produce a corresponding richness of philosophy-it only leads to the repetition of the same ideas. Yet, there is freshness in such reiteration because it is made with newly discovered convic- tion, and is not a mere quotation, since it is a true experience of a person and a generation in a new historical, social and cultural setting. In fact, it may even lead to a novel conclusion. It is the setting, at the turn of the century in Russia, when Judaism was in a state of ferment, which gives Feierberg's story its relevance and poignancy. This peculiar setting and historical junction give his open protest and dissent a distinctive and innovative significance. For Nahman's dissent, though it in- volves an open break with God and the discarding of fundamental Jewish be- lief, did not lead to the abandonment of Judaism, but, paradoxically, to dis- sent within Judaism; it is a dissent which shows that Judaism can survive the death of its God. Typically, the title of the story is Le'an? [Whither?]. Nahman represents a generation which loses God, but is determined not to be lost; which discards the old belief, but looks for a new way-indeed, a new faith. Nahman, alias Feierberg, looks at the Zionist revival and the establishment of a new, healthy Jewish nation in its old land with approval. He goes beyond that, however. He links this national revival with a universal destiny, as a revival of the East against the decaying West. The reborn Jewish nation, which came from the East and is to return there, should provide a spiritual leadership for this uni- versal historical reversal. While this ideal sounds rather vague, and though belief in universal des- tinies for various nations may have been fashionable in those days, the point made by Feierberg remains significant. It reveals the transnational nature of Judaism -which is evident in the religious belief and which survives in secular nationalism. As a religion, although Judaism is a national religion, it has universal elements in that it claims that God of Israel is universal, that justice is one, and that ultimately the whole world will be perfect. Significantly, the abandonment of religion for a secular nationalism did not necessarily lead to self-exclusion from the concerns of the rest of the world, as nationalism so often does. The idea of a model society, of setting an example for other na- tions, of attaining a perfection in the moral sense -and not only national inde- pendence and security--has consistently accompanied Zionist ideology. It is vaguely expressed in Feierberg's tale. Thus, this story symbolizes the capacity of Judaism (as a civilization of three millennia) to suffer dissent from a central doctrine -that of belief in a just God--and yet to survive as a perpetual civilization by virtue of the continuity of national culture (language, literature,</page><page sequence="24">212 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES and customs), and the persistence of transnational concerns and dreams. Though not every dissent from the main current of Judaism could be contained within it (for dissent often resulted in a break with the nation-Church), the modern era provided the example of a dissent which became internalized. The dissent thus amounted to an inner change in the national civilization. This change came to be accepted by a great number of Jews and could be thought to shape the mainstream of Judaism today. 4 It may now be evident that Judaism, throughout its long historical development, has exhibited a peculiar capacity to combine a large degree of consistent adherence to a core of beliefs with a tendency to question these and occasionally even to dissent from them. This phenomenon, far from being taken for granted, is surprising in a culture based on and rooted in a religious belief. We usually assume that religion by its very nature is impatient with questioning and doubting. If the truth is revealed by God, as Judaism main- tains (similar to various other religions), what point is there in allowing doubts? There is a strong case for toleration of dissenting opinions, if all opin- ions are taken to be human- as, indeed, the case for toleration was made by John Stuart Mill. If, however, the Truth comes directly from God, as tradi- tional Judaism maintains, how can man question it or dissent from it, and why should the devout followers of divine commandments tolerate the skeptics, let alone the dissenters? Still, while the logical argument against toleration in Judaism is strong, as are the psychological factors which make ardent believers intolerant men, the historical fact remains that Judaism has, by and large, shown a remarkable degree of forbearance for a religiously imbued civilization. This does not mean that Judaism has been indifferent to skeptical opinions, not to say dis- senting views and acts. Nothing could be further from truth. The attitude of Judaism to skeptics and dissenters could best be explained by comparing it to the attitude of a father toward his own children who are behaving badly. He may resent it, suffer because of it, and argue with them. Yet-unless they go too far--he will show self-restraint, and learn to live with them. Similarly, Judaism's toleration has been a painful one: anger at the deviant and compas- sion for him were often mixed, resulting in an ambivalent attitude. This broad generalization may require some qualification. If the attitude to deviance is observed in a more detailed way, it may well be noted that in some cases the attitude of the mainstream believers was more tolerant and sometimes less so, and occasionally became even intolerant. Sometimes sym- pathy was shown for the doubter, on other occasions outright resentment was</page><page sequence="25">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 213 faced by the deviant. In part, this may have been due to historical cir- cumstances, but neither these nor the relevant cases in past history can be traced here. What can be attempted, however, is the delineation of certain characteristics of toleration in Judaism. Which kind of skepticism and dissent tended to be suffered and which less so or not at all? In what way did "Father" Judaism evaluate the revolt of his children and accordingly decide on his at- titude toward them? One category in which little or no toleration has been shown is that where deviation from established ways does not pertain so much to fundamentals of belief, as it does to practical ways of worship and observance, or, at most, to secondary principles of theology. (While this category has not been of concern in this study, it should be mentioned here to provide the proper perspective for the overall understanding of toleration in Judaism.) Thus, the attitude of rab- binite Judaism to Karaism, which rejects the Talmud and interprets certain re- ligious commandments somewhat differently, has been mostly hostile. Paradoxically, a Jew who openly declares disbelief in God and in practice observes neither the Talmud nor the Torah, will get better treatment from an observant Jew than an observant Karaite Jew. Similarly, an orthodox Jew would look with unqualified resentment upon reform Judaism -which accepts a great part, if not all, of traditional Jewish theology, while deviating in the form of worship -and he may not show it to a non-practicing Jew. Not to at- tend the synagogue seems to be more easily tolerated than to worship without covering the head, to mention a detail in the reform service. At one time the attitude of the established rabbinical authorities toward the emerging Hasidism was anything but tolerant. This intolerance of the less deviant, coupled with relative tolerance of the total skeptic in Judaism, is the very opposite of John Locke's doctrine of tol- eration. Locke, while advocating toleration of diverse religious beliefs and practices, excluded atheists from enjoying this liberal approach: ". . . those who deny the existence of the Deity are not to be tolerated at all."46 Locke's stand taken from the religious point of view seems logically more plausible. The explanation of the paradoxical attitude of Judaism in this respect, though partially explicable because of Judaic philosophy, must also resort to factors which lie outside the domain of philosophical or theological argument, and which belong to the realm of psychology and sociology. For one thing, Judaism seems to put more stress on the actual observance of commandments and on forms of worship than on belief. Practice seems more important than theory and, consequently, deviance from established ways, and advocacy of different forms of worship, is actually viewed as a more serious menace to Judaism than spiritual and intellectual questioning and disagreement.</page><page sequence="26">214 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES Another characteristic attitude of Judaism is that it tends to be much more tolerant of an individual's skepticism or even dissent than of a sectarian movement's. Such a body, even if its deviation from the established ways is minimal, will cause much greater hostility than an individual who poses very fundamental questions, or even transgresses cardinal commandments. Also, the tendency of Judaism to react more negatively to deviants who share the fundamentals of religion than to those who are philosophically fur- ther removed is typical of most creeds -religious or not. Christianity and com- munism have often viewed sectarianism in a similar manner. The deviation of the close and faithful is a betrayal, whereas those who do not believe are less of- fensive to the true faith. These characteristic attitudes suggest a sociological explanation. In its display of intolerance toward certain forms of deviation, Judaism tries to pro- tect its own existence. With an historical or sociological insight, it realizes that the great danger to its survival is not so much reflective individuals, as poten- tial or actual mass-movements. Thus a sectarian deviation, however minor, is a sign of peril to the unity of the people-community-Church. Similarly, the em- phasis on practice can be explained as the realization of the significance of form and the actual way of life as the binding force of the communal-religious entity, a force stronger than dogmas or philosophical doctrines. Finally, the deviation of those who share the fundamentals of faith is felt to be the splitting of the nucleus, a peril at the very core of the Jewish community. Unity there is of greater significance than at the periphery, where deviation can be tolerated more easily. In brief, it is the quest for survival of Judaism-as a nation, a civilization, and a religion-which seems to best explain its paradoxical intol- erance of relatively minor deviation, while remaining comparatively broad- minded to fundamental questioning. This sociological speculation, however plausible in accounting for the apparent paradox, is not enough to fully explain the degree of toleration which Judaism has exhibited toward skeptics, and perhaps even dissenters of the more profound and philosophical variety. For while sectarianism may be more dan- gerous to a community-Church than individual questioning, such querying may well be the incipient stage of sectarianism. While practice may be of more concern than theory to a socially organized religion, there are links between thoughts and actions. Other religions and ideologies often showed intolerance toward any sign of skepticism. Tolerance in Judaism toward profound ques- tioning-and it is this kind of questioning in Judaism which is the focus of in- quiry-has its own peculiar roots, which should be further explored. More thorough examination should be made of the actual attitude of those in authority toward the doubters. The very presence of books such as Job and Ecclesiastes in the Bible is a</page><page sequence="27">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 215 testimony to the toleration of the scholars who decided on the contents of the Holy Scriptures. Some evidence of their hesitations and their positions during the decision-making process can be found in the Talmud, wherein the com- plexity of attitudes can be traced. In the case of Job, a laconic pronouncement is made: "Moses wrote his own book and the portion of Balaam and Job."47 The statement may well be meant to overcome any doubt about the acceptability of Job as a holy book, since whatever Moses, the intermediary at Sinai and the pronouncer of divine law, wrote should be regarded as fit for inclusion in the Holy Scriptures, de- spite its contents. Yet, scholarly readers of the book were not mentally blind and, indeed, had voiced some doubt and even outrage at the contents of Job. Thus, referring to Satan's incitement of God to destroy Job for no reason (Job 2:3), "Said R. Johanan: Were it not expressly stated in the Scripture, we would not dare to say it. [God is made to appear] like a man who allows himself to be persuaded against his better judgment."48 The passage conveys criticism of the idea that God follows the advice of Satan (on which the fable of Job rests), a situation contrary to Judaism's notions of a just and wise God who obviously should be immune to such sinister influences. Another reaction recorded in the Talmud expresses ill-feeling about Job's audacity to put himself on the same moral level as God. Referring to Job's quest for an umpire between God and himself (Job 9:33), but having in mind the broader issue of Job's human pride, "Rab said: Dust should be placed in the mouth of Job: is there a servant who argues with his master?"49 Still another passage tries to salvage Judaism's fundamental notions of the justness of God in rewarding the righteous by completely twisting the story and intent of the book of Job: it turns Job into a less than perfect heathen, whose blasphemy leads to divine punishment, camouflaged by a seeming reward: "There was a certain pious man among the heathen named Job, but he [thought that he had] come into this world only to receive [here] his reward, and when the Holy One, blessed be He, brought chastisements upon him, he began to curse and blaspheme, so the Holy One, blessed be He, doubled his reward in this world so as to expel him from the world to come."50 While these opinions and stories clearly indicate the raised eyebrows, mis- givings, and resentment about the theological assumptions in Job, the audacity of Job vis-'a-vis God, and even about God's reward to Job, the fact remains that the book of Job was included in the Bible and has become a part of Jewish heritage. There must have been sages who insisted on the inclusion in the Holy Scriptures of this book of profound skepticism, and it is they who prevailed. It may have been a painful decision, but the verdict was not to oust the accuser of God from the assembly of books meant to guide His people on their way into the future.</page><page sequence="28">216 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES The attitude toward Ecclesiastes, as recorded in the Talmud, seems to re- veal a similar, if less vehement, ambivalence. The objections to Ecclesiastes ap- pear in a rather veiled form: "Rab Judah son of R. Samuel b. Shilath said in Rab's name: The Sages wished to hide the Book of Ecclesiastes, because its words are self-contradictory; yet why did they not hide it? Because its begin- ning is religious teaching and its end is religious teaching."51 The passage is clear evidence of the sages' misgivings about the book by recording their intention "to hide" it, that is to say, to exclude it from the Bi- ble. Yet, the reason given for this unfulfilled intention is somewhat strange - namely, the contradictory contents of the book. For while contradictory state- ments can be found in Ecclesiastes, there are other books in the Bible whose logical consistency could also be questioned. The true reason for the intention to exclude the book from the Holy Scriptures may be sought in the justification given for its inclusion: that it starts and ends with "religious teaching" (the literal translation of the Hebrew phrase would be "words of Torah"). Since the beginning and ending of the book were the reasons for its inclusion, the re- maining portions must have been the source of the misgivings. A closer examination of the book's contents easily reveals that the religious frame (the opening and the ending) in no way balances the areligious part. In- deed, this frame is negligible when compared with the bulk of the book. The dissenting philosophy, at best, may be said to be sandwiched between two slices of piety, but even this is an overstatement. The slice covering the twelve chapters of skepticism consists of a mere two verses, exhorting man to fear God and keep His commandments and promising divine judgment (12:13-14). The opening "words of Torah" do not exist at all. It is only a Talmudic derash (following the abovequoted passage) which interprets the verse "What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?" (1:3) as meaning that learning of Torah, which preceded the sun, is worthwhile -it is only such an interpretation which turns the opening into a religious teaching. Thus, it can be safely concluded that, while the sages realized the dissenting and areligious meaning of Ecclesiastes and may have seriously considered "hiding" it, their respect for and toleration of the sincere philosophy of the preacher ul- timately prevailed. To justify to others, and perhaps even to themselves, the in- clusion of such a book in the Holy Scriptures, they may have appended a pious statement, and some rushed with stretched interpretations of the opening, thus providing an excuse, a coverup, to counteract their religious concern. Such stratagems enabled them to exercise their inherent broad-mindedness and to tolerate the dissenting philosophy. The case of R. Elisha ben Abuyah provides an interesting illustration of the attitude of his contemporaries toward his open dissent. While his defiant breach with Judaism is obviously resented- symbolized by the practice of refer-</page><page sequence="29">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 217 ring to the prominent scholar and teacher as Aher-one can detect signs of respect, and even concern, for the man. Thus, in a touching story, Elisha is described as riding a horse on a Sabbath down the street in Tiberias, when his former disciple, R. Meir, interrupts his expounding in the House of Study and goes out to meet his one-time teacher. Despite the flagrant breach of the sacred law by Elisha ben Abuyah, R. Meir remains devoted to him and even tries to persuade him to return to the fold of Judaism.52 Other tales in this vein cor- roborate this attitude: obviously, it is not an indifferent toleration of dissent and apostasy; but it shows respect and love for a prominent man who went astray by those who knew him as a person and a teacher. The legend does not frown on such an attitude, but records it in an objective and even sympathetic manner. This concerned attitude toward a dissenter should not be interpreted as an exception, explicable by Elisha ben Abuyah's prominence in learning. For while this excellence does play a role in the attitude of relative indulgence toward him, the general attitude to dissenters throughout the succeeding gen- erations seems to have been, by and large, exceptionally lenient. Thus, a famous passage in the Talmud gives this charitable interpretation to the verse "Israel hath sinned" (Joshua 7:11): "R. Abba b. Zabda said: Even though [the people] have sinned, they are still [called] 'Israel'." And the point is empha- sized by a parable: "R. Abba said: Thus people say, A myrtle, though it stands among reeds, is still a myrtle, and it is so called."53 The statement of R. Abba b. Zabda was later used by generations of rabbinical scholars to justify the regarding of apostates from Judaism as Jews in the religious-legal sense. They were, of course, sinning Jews, who could not have been viewed otherwise without impinging on Jews' confidence in their own creed and ways; but sin- ners are still a part of the community, of the people, and they can repent and reembark on the right way. This does not mean that Judaism has looked upon dissenters and apostates with unmixed feelings. For one thing, the rabbinical authorities through the ages have not held consistent views about those who left Judaism and especially about those who were actually converted to another religion and were occa- sionally seen as non-Jews legally.54 Moreover, in the popular attitude toward dissenters, a clear and emphatic distinction has been made between the dissenter who abandoned the Jewish faith and observance and the one who ac- tually became converted into another religion. The former has come to be called epikuros, a term associated with Epicurus, the Greek philosopher, while the latter is referred to as meshummad, an apostate, but also a traitor. Thus, the willing convert is, by and large, a despised figure in Judaism. Still, rab- binical law, in a sense more flexible than public sentiment, leaves a gate wide open for him to return to the fold. The epikuros, on the other hand, especially</page><page sequence="30">218 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES during times of a wide spectrum of religious skepticism and dissent, may re- main on good terms with any but the most strictly orthodox without giving up his dissenting philosophy. How, then, should the overall tolerant attitude of Judaism toward in- dividual questioning and even to dissent be explained? In answering this ques- tion a distinction must be made between a theoretical questioning and a fac- tual abandonment of Judaism; between the idea and the act. Speaking of ideas, contained in such books as Job, or even the areligious Ecclesiastes, toleration is encountered, which seems to be rooted in a genuine respect for the human mind and its free search for answers to the questions which puzzle man. This attitude seems to be a logical and psychological corol- lary of the fundamental notion that man can discuss moral issues with God, as Abraham did. Once man is endowed with the faculty of independent thinking, how and why should he be stopped? As a party to a dialogue with God, as a be- ing endowed with reason, as a creature in quest of the right way-not to men- tion the endless arguments about the Law which form the substance of the Talmud-man cannot be muzzled. Should his quest lead him astray, his search must still be respected and the temptation of the authority to censor thinking must be checked. Toleration of ideas is established, not as a formal doctrine, but as the accepted proper practice. Yet, when the exploration leads to an act of apostasy, the attitude of Judaism changes. For though apostasy may be a logical conclusion from a the- oretical position, it is also a breach with the community of the believers. It is the abandonment of the national-religious entity that Judaism has been through the ages, which turns the apostate into an outcast and a traitor. Paradoxically, it is still these communal connections to a fellow Jew which also cause Jews to consider the apostate as a Jew, despite his apostasy. The na- tional-communal attachment reveals ties which are stronger than belief and ideas. "Even though he has sinned, he is still Israel." Significantly, the attach- ment to the rebellious individual is rooted in concern for him as an individual and is not caused by toleration of his philosophy. It is concern for a living fellow Jew and not respect for the ideas which led him astray. Indeed, one could say that a philosophy which had caused actual dissent of an individual is looked upon with resentment, while it may be tolerated as long as it does not lead to a social breach. Judaism's attachment to individuals because they are Jews, an attachment which cannot be explained on religious grounds but is explicable in na- tionalistic terms, is a familiar theme in the rabbinical literature. Thus one sage pronounces that "The fire of Gehinnom [hell] has no power over the transgres- sors of Israel."55 Even though this pronouncement is justified in the context by</page><page sequence="31">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 219 the alleged good deeds of the sinners, the communal-national attachment mo- tivating such a statement is evident. Conversely, the sinners of Israel are said to retain their love for Israel. Thus, while the prophets of the other nations, like Balaam (raised by incantations), advise their interlocutor not to seek the peace or prosperity of Israel, the response of the sinners of Israel is: "Seek their welfare, seek not their harm. Whoever touches them touches the apple of his eye."56 The bonds of loyalty within the community of Israel seem to reach beyond the observance of the law, the mutual goodwill extends beyond the principles of religion. The attachment to individuals of Israel, despite their be- liefs and deeds is exemplified in a discussion between two sages: " 'Ye are sons of the Lord your God' [Deuteronomy 14:1]; when you behave as sons you are designated sons; if you do not behave as sons, you are not designated sons: this is R. Judah's view. R. Meir said: In both cases you are called sons."57 And R. Meir adduces further arguments (by midrashic interpretations of selected bib- lical verses) to prove that even those of Israel who lack faith, or serve idols, re- main God's sons. Again, it is transparent that the national attachment motivates the midrashic rationalization. Yet, the indulgence of the sinners and dissenters is not unequivocal, as il- lustrated by the stand of R. Judah and that already intimated above. The am- bivalence toward the actual dissenter allows modifications of attitudes toward him, depending on historical circumstances and on the nature of dissent. It is this flexibility in the traditional attitude which enabled the distinction between the popular resentment to a convert to another religion, an apostate to another church, and the popular sufferance of a man who, while disobeying the laws of Judaism, did not opt for a different society of believers and is thus considered not to have severed his ties with Judaism as a nation and even as a Church. Thus, to conclude this discussion of toleration in Judaism, its nature is rather peculiar. It is toleration of freedom of the mind, even if it reaches con- clusions which are inimical to Judaism. It is toleration of individuals who, in Judaism's judgment, have gone astray, and yet may be tolerated out of concern for them as Jews, members of a community which is bound not only by doc- trinal, but also by social-national ties. Yet, the essential commitment to Juda- ism-in the comprehensive social-religious-national-cultural sense--remains the focus, be it a flexible focus, of historic Jewry. Such toleration of deviation is not the result of indifference; nor is it an abdication of a self-confident way of life. The truth is believed to be known and is firmly pursued, but question- ing and, up to a point, dissent are tolerated. That questioning may occasional- ly lead to a change in the course of the mainstream, to a modification of faith, is a by-product of toleration, but not its declared aim -as it is in the European philosophy of toleration.</page><page sequence="32">220 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES 5 The peculiar relationship between authority and skepticism, or even dis- sent, in Judaism and the distinctive nature of Judaic toleration, characterizing this relationship, seem to have carried over from the religiously dominated culture into its nationalistically colored succession. The traditional Judaic con- figuration of authority-skepticism-dissent can be detected in the presently dominant form of Judaism, that is to say, in Zionism and its implementation in the State of Israel. The religious devotion which has characterized the Zionist movement and the building of the State of Israel has been, except for a significant minority, a devotion in which an ideal replaced God as the focus of belief and worship. The power, authority and demands of a collective ideal, of a secular religion, could be as absolute as those of God. The rule of a government representing this ideal could be as despotic as the rule of a fanatical hierocracy. Yet, this has not been the case in Zionism and in modern Israel. Both have exhibited a rich- ness of ideas and a tolerance of such a variety, uncommon for a dedicated social movement and unusual for a newly-born, or recently reborn, nation- alism. This can largely, if not solely, be attributed to the peculiar trait of Judaism, as outlined and analyzed in this study. The continuation of this trait in the recent mainstream of Judaism, however, had to undergo certain modifi- cations, because the central faith has gone through a profound change by sub- stituting religious nationalism for a nationalistic religion. The change at the center of faith has led to a greater variety of interpreta- tions and ways than was the case with a religion-dominated Judaism. For the God of Israel and the ways to serve Him had come to be well defined and set- tled over the millennia; the new ideal, Zionism, while deeply rooted in the old tradition, had various novel, as yet undefined, aspects, open to inspiration, vi- sion, and argument of men. If the old mainstream tolerated doubts, the new one virtually invited a spectrum of philosophies. The established tradition of asking and doubting could bloom into a wide search for answers. The resulting range of ideas, systems, objectives and means became vast and varied. Indeed, even a cursory glance at the foundations of modern Jewish na- tionalism presents not one but a series of Zionisms, each with some fundamen- tal distinctive element. There is the well-known political Zionism, expecting Jewish independence to provide an answer to antisemitism and persecution of Jews, developed by such personalities as Leo Pinsker (1821-1891) and Theodor Herzl (1860-1904). There is the cultural-ethical Zionism of Ahad Ha'am (1856-1927), for whom the moral regeneration of the people and the unity of the national culture was the focus of Jewish renaissance. Another trend em- phasizes the synthesis between the traditional religious way of life and the na-</page><page sequence="33">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 221 tional revival in the Land of Israel. This trend, precursed more than a hun- dred years ago by Rabbi Yehudah Alkalai (1798-1878) and Rabbi Zvi Hirsh Kalischer (1795-1874), was further advanced by Yehiel Michael Pines (1842- 1912) and Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1865-1935). Another founder, Eliezer Ben-Yehudah (1858-1923), wanted the Jews to become a "normal" nation and worked hard and successfully for the revival of Hebrew as everyday language. Micah Joseph Berdichevski (1865-1921) exhibits an antitraditionalist, self- assertive, Nietzschean Zionism. Nationalism with universalist elements is foreshadowed by Moses Hess (1812-1875). Socialist Zionism has its own proph- ets: Nahman Syrkin (1867-1924) is an ethical socialist-Zionist, Ber Borochov (1881-1917) applies Marxism to his syncretistic system, while Aaron David Gordon (1856-1922) introduces Tolstoyan piety to his idealization of physical labor in and on the land of the fathers.58 The list is not exhaustive and the nature of the diverse philosophies is merely suggested. It should be noted that this unusual diversity, though not free from outside influences (as should be clear even from this sketchy presentation), can be seen as the prodigious prog- eny of the critical and exploratory tendency in the Jewish tradition. Significantly, the quest for a new way continued also on the level of imple- mentation of ideals. Thus, the search for the good community led to the es- tablishment of the collective agricultural settlement, widely known as the kib- butz. This unique Zionist achievement exhibited, within its own range of con- cerns, the kind of variety of ways which characterized the Zionist movement at large. There were some settlements which insisted on a small size community, with intimate face to face relations among the members. Others preferred large settlements whose population could reach one or two thousand members. Moreover, from the strictly collective kibbutz - no private property, communal care of children, common kitchen and dining-room--the moshav eventually branched. This form of settlement cooperates in the sale of produce and in the purchase of equipment and supply, but each family has its own house and farm. The moshav shitufi, a crossbreed of the moshav and the kibbutz, leaves each family its private household, including child care, but retains collective ownership and economy. The variety of ideals and ways is very prominently exhibited in the often maligned Israeli party system. The spectrum here is bewildering, so that any distinction between Right and Left would be a gross simplification. There is the Labor party, flanked by more radical socialists and by two Communist par- ties. There are the liberals and then other liberals linked with ardent national- ists. There is a religious bloc, incorporating a few parties. Occasionally small parties with old or new ideas and ideologies also appear. The various parties are generally an applied continuation of older Zionist ideologies, though naturally, there is some modification of the old philosophies and introduction</page><page sequence="34">222 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES of new issues into the political life. Whatever one's opinion about the advisabil- ity of having so many parties in a democratic society, it has to be stressed that they largely express a genuine ideological or philosophical diversity and not merely or predominantly a conflict of economic interests. The diversity of par- ties in Israel can be much better understood as a quest for the right way, for a pseudoreligious answer, than as an expression of economic condition, social class structure, or sectional interests.59 Although the spectrum of search for the new way in Zionist ideology, col- lective settlement, and in politics has been wide, it could be said that, by and large, the variety did not lead to centrifugal disintegration. Despite fierce con- troversies and acrimonious accusations, often dominating Zionist congresses, Israeli politics and even occasionally the kibbutz movement, the focus of the Zionist revival remained intact. The dominant idea of the new belief was vir- tually accepted by all. Moreover, the various ideologies were not necessarily mutually exclusive and often complemented each other. Thus, political Zionism could be com- bined with a cultural revival of Jews. Normalization of Jewish life could be in- fused with ideals of creating a just society. In political life too the parties may have learned from one another more than they care to admit. There may be a deeper sense of political consensus in Israel in the 1960s and the 1970s than during the earlier days of the state, not to mention the turbulent last years of the British Mandate. Even the collective village movement, which was orig- inated by and has largely been the domain of various labor-Zionist organiza- tions and parties, has had followers among other sections of the Zionist move- ment and Israeli society. There are kibbutzim of Liberal (non-socialist) persua- sion and there are strictly orthodox kibbutzim, affiliated with the religious par- ties. Among the moshavim a much larger proportion of religious and liberal settlements can be found. One trait which has dominated Zionism in its various stages of transition from theory to practice, in its diverse ways of combining ideals and reality, was the great zeal for a new right way. In this sense, Zionism is a religious move- ment, whether or not its proponents are believers or agnostics, traditionalists or iconoclasts, politically minded or spiritually oriented, Marxists or disciples of Tolstoy. It is this passionate quest for a way of life which caused the col- lective settlement movement to strike roots in the reborn Jewish society and be- come such an important factor in the revival of Israel. It provided a new religion, which complemented the elements of Zionist faith by concrete daily practice, as traditional Judaism does. That some orthodox Jews could add this new burden to the yoke of traditional observance is a testimony to the intensity of the religious quest inherent in Judaism. So, in a sense, is the fact that kib-</page><page sequence="35">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 223 butz appealed to many who had discarded traditional religion. Thus, even if the direction of the mainstream inJudaism changed, the passionate piety-with- observance continued.60 This ardor has been characteristic of Judaism, whether in its traditional religious form, or in the newer Zionist transformation (one is tempted to say, modification). Indeed, it has characterized peripheral Jewish movements out- side Zionism and has often been typical of individual Jews who espoused some cause. It would seem that whatever Jews undertake, they do it (to use the phrasing of Deuteronomy 6:5) with all their heart, and with all their soul, and with all their might. The explanation of this trait, which though not exclusive- ly Jewish is characteristic of the Jews, seems to be in the perennial quest of Judaism for the morally right rather than for the scientifically true. It is not the descriptive but the ethical truth that is the focus of Jewish concern. It is not the Galilean "eppur si muove," but the Abrahamic "Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?" that motivates Judaism. It did so when man confronted God; it does so when man confronts the abyss of nothingness. One might add that the problems of rectitude fire human emotions more than the problems of truth. The impact of the authority-skepticism-dissent relationship in the religious tradition of Judaism on its nationalistic phase has been noticeable not only in the rich spectrum of ideologies, outlined above, but it has also carried over to the relationship between the people and their government, as well as between individuals and the government, the state, the people. Here, too, the attitudes and stands have been formed by the ardor which has characterized Judaism from its early contentions with God about right and justice. While it is true that individuals and groups have occasionally opposed or resisted dictates of government in the name of religious belief, this might hap- pen when the religious practice collided with political demands. Where no such collision occurred, the obedience to one authority would strengthen the acceptance of another. Indeed, the precept "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's" (St. Mark 12:17), whatever its moral and political implications, reflects a true and significant psychological insight: obedience to one authority enhances the obedience to another. Thus, while political and religious obedience could reinforce each other, whenever secular authority succeeded religious dominion, it tended to inherit the latter's dominance over people. Those used to obedience may well continue to be when the nature of the authority changes. People who obeyed the priest will obey the commissar, once the new ideology has been accepted. Those who followed the Church and its head will, having accepted the change, follow the state and its leader. It might be expected that this transference of</page><page sequence="36">224 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES attitudes from religion to politics pertains to Judaism, too. The Zionist state and its government could well be - to the secular Jew-the "Mortal God," to use the phrase of Thomas Hobbes. Yet, the transfer of attitudes in this case, though assumed to exist, is more complex. It could be simplified by being stated in the form of a logical infer- ence: if the authority of God used to be examined and questioned, the author- ity of state and government may be subject to probing and doubt a fortiori. In other words, the skepticism, and even dissent, which has been peculiar to traditional Judaism continues to characterize the modern Jewish faith and the attitude toward its institutions: besides being transferred, it is also strength- ened because the new ideal is not, after all, God. Thus, the attitude of ordinary and unsophisticated citizens to the govern- ment tends to be quite critical and to show little respect and even less reverence for its functionaries. There has hardly been a prominent figure, including presidents, prime ministers and ministers, who has not served as the butt of popular jokes or who has not been belittled by some. Often people talk about politics and politicians in a manner implying that they, the critics, could per- form the job much better. The relationship toward the government and its high functionaries is quite egalitarian, because those who choose the govern- ment tend to consider themselves at least as capable as those whom they elect into office. A democratic, almost an anarchic, element is assured by this ex- treme self-confidence of the people in its relationship to the government. Patriotic arguments are sometimes raised in Israel in support of govern- ment authority. One such argument, typical of popular democratic ideology, that the government is right because it is democratically elected, and ulti- mately represents the voice of the people, will not usually carry much weight. For even if vox populi is assumed to be vox Dei, did not Abraham, Moses, Job, and various sages argue with God? When the problem of what is right occurs, a single man can argue with the position of God, the government, the majority which chooses it, or with the bulk of the people. In such a confrontation one may be forced to bow to the decisions of the many, but one certainly is in the right to assert one's conscientious conviction. It is this particular reasoning -believed to dominate the subconsciousness of many and the consciousness of some-which explains not only the self- assertion of the people in the face of government, but also the independent stand of groups and individuals in the face of government and people. For they have shown unusual persistence and determination in defending and practic- ing their opinions in the presence of official and public disapproval. This was characteristic of both the pre-state Zionist settlement and the next quarter cen- tury of political independence. A few instances will illustrate the point. The so-called right wing para-military organizations were engaged in their</page><page sequence="37">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 225 own political and military activity, defying the Jewish self-governing institu- tions during the latter days of the British Mandate. At the same time a small group of pacifists and intellectuals, under the leadership of Judah L. Magnes and Martin Buber, advocated a binational state-again in defiance of a very broad Jewish consensus. With the establishment of the State of Israel, some of this political "dissent" declined, though not immediately, while new groups oc- casionally appeared which took a profoundly critical view of the dominant and widely accepted policies and which even got parliamentary representation, such as "Ha-olam Hazeh- New Force." The essential characteristic of these groups has been that, independent of their size and message, they insisted upon arguing, working and fighting for their point of view, no matter the popular stand, prevailing opinion, or almost universal consensus. Considering themselves to be right, they have challenged the almighty people, as their ancestors had the Almighty Himself. Indeed, the almost nonchalant absence of concern for the established opinion and the insistence on the right, or what is believed to be right, has often been expressed even in individual, unorganized, attitudes. Thus, Israeli writers have often been concerned about the Arabs and the moral purity of Zionism and Israel in their relations with the Arabs. Significantly, to quote one example, a prominent Hebrew writer, S. Yizhar, published a story criticiz- ing the somewhat harsh treatment of an Arab prisoner, shortly after the dif- ficult Arab-Jewish war of 1947-1948.61 A cause could be taken up single- handedly not only by wielders of the pen. Eliezer Ben-Yehudah in the early years of the Zionist settlement is said to have fought fiercely for use of Hebrew as the everyday language. In fairly recent years we have witnessed Abie Nathan make an individual effort to establish peace in the Middle East.62 There have been many individual stands of this kind in modern Israel's short history, although most have not been widely publicized. One could say, that Socratic gadflies of one sort or another, while occasionally making their appearance in various societies, have been unusually frequent in Israel. The attempt has been made to link this phenomenon with the authority- skepticism tradition in Judaism. It could also be coupled with the prophetic heritage, in that the prophet, in the name of God, not against Him, argues for the right. In fact, these two opposing traditions are linked with one another: for the prophet would argue against human authority and against the people, but he would also argue with God, asJeremiah or Habakkuk did. Ultimately, it is distilled to the moral self-assertion of man and his confidence that, like God, he knows good and evil, for which he is concerned and responsible in society. A concomitant of this situation is the air of toleration pervading Israel. The people--individually and in groups, organizations, parties--express their views and work for them; the government, the party in power, the majority, do</page><page sequence="38">226 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES not attempt to repress the spectrum of freedom, which sometimes may seem to border on chaos. Unlike Athenian democracy which condemned Socrates, Israel does not persecute its gadflies. This toleration could be attributed to the conscious acceptance of western democratic principles in modern Israel. Yet, this is not a sufficient ex- planation. For we have to bear in mind that the majority of the Jews in Israel came from countries which have had no democratic institutions, or, at best, had only brief and superficial democratic-liberal interludes in their history. The leadership of Israeli society--mostly immigrants from eastern Europe, or their descendants-is also in this category. The British rule during the Man- date could not have affected the attitudes of the people so profoundly, and, besides, it did not practice liberal democracy, though it was relatively tolerant for a colonial regime. Therefore, it seems reasonable to look into Jewish traditions for the roots of Israeli toleration: the respect for man's search for right, even if this search leads him to unorthodox conclusions. Of course, in the new, relatively secular situation, where the search is undertaken along numerous paths by organized groups, the plurality enhances toleration. The lonely individual also benefits from this general attitude; besides, he may be considered as an incipient organization, a party in the making. One should remember that Zionism was a minority movement, at one time, occasionally promoted by a single figure, Theodor Herzl. Even without these considerations, however, a lonely Abraham could argue with God and was tolerated by Him. While Israel formally accepts and genuinely practices western-style tolera- tion, it is noteworthy that this practice has certain peculiarities in Israel, distinguishing it from its western liberal-democratic counterpart. Dissimilar to the West, diverse opinions held by parties, groups and individuals in Israel are not tentative, probing, or experimental- a temporary commitment on the way to Truth. People are not tolerant because they are ready to be persuaded to change their philosophy or switch their party. The political and social arena is not one of exploratory intellectual intercourse, as John Stuart Mill assumed it to be. People in Israel tend to be deeply and almost dogmatically convinced of the truth of their respective opinions and philosophies. In this sense, the religious traditions continue as new fervent beliefs. People are tolerant not because they expect that others may be right; they are tolerant despite their conviction that only they are right. The toleration thrives in an atmosphere of heightened passion and ardent belief. It is toleration despite an emotional urge not to tolerate. It is a toleration which is but one side of an ambivalent at- titude; the other side is a firm conviction in the absolute rightness of one's way. The ambivalence, again, is reminiscent of the religious attitude toward skep- tics and dissenters.</page><page sequence="39">Authority, Skepticism and Dissent 227 Still, toleration persists because of the perennial respect for the arguing man, who contends with God and other men about what is right. It also per- sists for another reason: a Jew and an Israeli who has an opinion holds it with such fervor and conviction that it is virtually impossible to silence him. This fervor too, as already noted, is a continuation of the long tradition of a passion- ate search for the right. NOTES 1.

The word used in the Hebrew original in this context is not brit, but amanah. Unlike brit, it is a rare word in the Bible, but essentially has the same meaning. 9. Cf. Philo, who makes the following observation about Moses, whose laws come from God: ". .. Moses himself was the best of all lawgivers in all countries, better in fact than any that have ever arisen among either the Greeks or the barbarians, and . . . his laws are most excellent and truly come from God .... But Moses is alone in this, that his laws, firm, unshaken, im- movable, stamped, at it were, with the seals of nature herself, remain secure from the day when they were first enacted to now, and ... for all future ages."-Philo (Judaeus), The Life of Moses, Book II, 12-15.

The question appearing in Plato's Euthyphro, especially (Steph.) 9d-10a, is slightly paraphrased here: "God" is substituted for "the gods," and "just" for "holy." It may be added that in the context of the Platonic dialogue "holy" implies also "just." 11. The King James version does not faithfully convey the Hebrew verse. The translation reads: "for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right," while "ye have not spoken to me true and sincere things" would be more accurate. Speaking to God, arguing with Him, implies a rational argument. See also Job 13:16: "for an hypocrite shall not come before him [God]." 12.

The article points out that the narrow translation of Torah as "law," follows the Septuagint and the New Testa- ment, which use the Greek nomos as the equivalent of Torah. 14. Riv el may be approximated by "complain" (cf. Jeremiah 2:29 and perhaps Isaiah 1:23), but it is a stronger expression, for riv essentially means "quarrel," or "dispute"- also</page><page sequence="40">228 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES "legal dispute." The King James version of this verse does not convey the meaning of the original faithfully and consequently had to be modified in the text. 15. "Chide" is an attempt to convey the meaning of the Hebrew phrase dabber mishpatim, literally, "talk judgments" (but not "talk of thy judgments," as King James version inter- pretatively translates it). Dabber mishpatim is a phrase occurring on several other occasions in Jeremiah (1:16; 4:12, 39:5; 52:9) and seems to indicate a vigorous rebuke and reprimand-either in the name of right judgment, or perhaps in the manner of a judgment. Thus the king of Babylon "talks judgments" to the imprisoned Zedekiah (eremiah 39:5 and 52:9). 16. The King James version uses the rather cumbersome phrase "holdest thy tongue" not demanded by the original taharish. 17. Cf. these doubts of prophets with similar ones expressed in the Psalms (e.g., 73:11-16 and 94:3-7). Typically for the pietistic Psalms, the questioning there is immediately followed by an answer, or an expression of confidence in divine justice. 18. Cf. also Chapters 7 and 10. 19. Derash is one of the methods for the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, deliberately contrasting with peshat, a simple and direct explanation. While derash purports to illuminate a verse by seeing in it a wider significance than its simple contextual meaning, in fact it is often a means for the exercise of a virtually free philosophical and moral speculation which is then ap- pended to a fitting biblical verse as an "interpretation." This make-believe procedure seems to have paid tribute to the notion that the Bible contains all the truth and wisdom, besides provid- ing mental exercise for the scholars and exhibiting their ingenuity and erudition. 20.

It is worthwhile in this connection to quote from a book about the collective settlement in Israel written by one of the early participants. Significantly, he uses the metaphor Shulhan Arukh for a projected code of the kevutzah (as a certain form of the kibbutz used to be called). The Shulhan Arukh is, of course, the compendium of religious laws used by the orthodox Jews for daily guidance. Some such daily guidance is sought for the collective settlers as well: "In order to give the kevutzah a distinct and stable form we must compose a 'Shulhan Arukh' which will teach us day and night . . . who we are and what we demand of life, and how we want to shape it so that it fits our objectives. These laws will oblige everybody, and the transgressor will encounter a stern reaction of the entire community."
