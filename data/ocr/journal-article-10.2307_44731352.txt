McKenzie Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp. THE DESIGN OF AN automobile air cushion restraint system providing occupant protection is an extensive process of sys- tems analysis, engineering, test, and evaluation. The study described in this paper is an attempt to establish systems analysis tools which are not only effective in evaluating cur- rent systems, but which also possess growth potential as new sensor, inflation, and cushion concepts are developed. The need for such systems analysis arises both from the high cost of safety-related experimentation and from the large number of safety system design parameters. This paper summarizes an air cushion restraint system study which was conducted jointly by Delco Electronics and GM Engineering Staff. The specific objectives of this study were to develop and experimentally verify mathematical models of selected candidate air cushion restraint systems to provide a method for simulating the dynamic interaction between occu- pants and restraint system during an automobile collision, and to develop an efficient means for conducting system perfor- mance tradeoff studies of promising system concepts. The principal effort was concentrated on: 1 . Construction and verification of mathematical models of existing sensor, inflation, and cushion systems. 2. Developing computer programs which permit study of occupant-cushion dynamics and analysis of system perfor- mance with computer generated graphics, utilizing actual crash deceleration data or simulated crash deceleration curves.

A tape of deceleration profiles containing a represen- tative spectrum of crash and noncrash data is used as input for both sensor and occupant kinematics models. Also, the deceleration trace forcing function can come from a vehicle crush simulation or from a sled test pulse. In the event of sensor trigger, the inflation and cushion models are actuated. As each cushion inflates within the automobile, both cushion position and internal pressure are computed. Occupant motion meanwhile is being calculated and time and position of contact with the restraint system is determined. An occupant cushion interaction model deter- mines the time-dependent force-deflection characteristics of each cushion and the retarding forces acting on the occupant. System evaluation can then be made on the basis of the load ABSTRACT This paper discusses the design of an automobile air cushion restraint system which will provide adequate occupant protec- tion. The extensive process employed in the design of such a system is presented; systems analysis, engineering, testing, and evaluation are the major points of the process. The program is intended to provide low-cost safety methods, and to provide a basis for future development of more improved safety systems. 63</page><page sequence="2">64 F. J. IRISH, ET AL. profile to which the occupant is subjected during the crash event. Mathematical models were constructed for a variety of inertial sensors. Each of these math models has been experi- mentally verified using acceleration and trigger time measure- ments made during sled tests of sensor prototypes in the laboratory. Cold gas and the pyrotechnic-type inflation systems were modeled; however, only the cold gas simulation will be described. Modeling of a two-compartment forward restraint cushion with a knee protection bag is possible with this model. The validation of these models is based on pressure measurements made in the base of the storage reservoir during tests and qualitative correlation of predicted cushion height versus time with that acquired from test films. These cushion models were subsequently incorporated into the occupant kinematics simulation. In order to utilize acceleration data from actual crash and environmental noncrash test programs, the study has required the development of several digital computer programs. These programs have been written for use on an IBM 360/65 and 2250 graphics console. Hard copy graphics are processed using a Stromberg Carlson 4060 graphics display unit. A description of the graphics display capability developed in this study is given. In order to more realistically study occupant-cushion dy- namics and other parameters as a function of acceleration profile, the inflation and air-cushion models have been integrated into a revised version of the planar Cornell Occupant Kinematics Model. The resulting program permits simulation of occupant restraint system dynamic interaction. This com- puter program has been employed to a limited extent in evaluating experimental restraint systems. The various portions of the model are discussed in detail in this paper. Comparison of the combined model with test results are presented along with design applications. Conclusions reached during the study are presented. CRUSH SIMULATION As mentioned previously, deceleration wave forms for a crashing vehicle can be obtained from barrier tests or by a vehicle crush simulation. A comprehensive crush simulation model was described by Kamal (1)*. This model and associ- ated computer code has been used to provide predicted deceleration wave forms for input to the occupant kinematics simulation. Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the vehicle crush simulation model. This model has been described thoroughly in Ref. 1 ; in essence, what the crush model predicts, is overall dynamic vehicle crush from nonlinear static force deflection curves of the eight components shown in Fig. 2. Although the principal use of this model is to provide an evaluation tool for vehicle structures analysts, an important output is the decelera- tion wave form of the simulated vehicle.

SENSOR MODELS During the study, considerable effort was devoted to developing and experimentally verifying math models of candidate sensors and writing programs for processing acceleration data tapes to be used in the digital solution of the sensor models, and also for graphics display. While these programs were being developed and checked out, there was an immediate requirement for some basic sensor design studies to be coordinated with current sensor development. The analog computer was employed to simulate various sensor configurations and to provide rapid checkout of the mathematical models. The principal sensor which evolved out of these joint experimental and analytical studies was a bidirectional model (Fig. 3). The main purpose of the simulation was to provide timely analysis and ease of parameter variation and to determine their effect on overall system performance. All model solu- tions have provided excellent correlation with actual test</page><page sequence="3">AIR CUSHION RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 65 results, where available, and have thus been of considerable value in conducting tradeoff and optimization studies. The math models of the mechanical sensors also were incorporated in the program for digital solution and display. ANALYTICAL MODEL - The equation of motion used for the bidirectional sensor is: (M + m/3) X + Kx = (M + m/3) a (t) - sgn (x) /¿mg - sgn (x) KxQ (1) where: M = seismic mass (plus washer mass in bidirectional case) m = mass of restraint spring x = linear acceleration of seismic mass x = linear velocity of seismic mass x = linear displacement of seismic mass K = spring rate Kxq = preload ¡i = coefficient of kinetic friction g = acceleration of gravity a(t) = external acceleration sgn (x) = sign of x; that is, plus if x is positive, minus if x is negative sgn (x) = sign of x; that is, plus if x is positive, minus if x is negative This bidirectional device allows the seismic mass to move either "forward" or "backward," depending upon the direc- tion of the vehicle acceleration. This model allows reversal of both the frictional and spring preload terms. The former reverses when the velocity changes sign, while the latter reverses when the displacement changes sign. A model for describing the firing pin motion is given by the following equation: (Mf + mF/3) xF + Kp (xp - Xp0) = (Mp + mF/3) a(t) (2) where M, m, x, x, K symbols correspond to parameters already defined, and the F subscript refers to the firing pin. RESULTS - The model was first evaluated by comparing its behavior with sled test results on the actual bidirectional device. This sensor was mounted on a sled along with an Endevco instrumentation accelerometer which measured the sled accelerations. The output of the Endevco accelerometer was displayed on an oscilloscope, giving the acceleration time profile. Forcing functions were applied to the sled in such a way as to give profiles approximating a half sine wave, and the firing time of the sensor was measured. Results were available for five cases of half sine wave acceleration profiles of varying amplitude and 80 ms duration, for comparison with the computer model. The actual device had a 0.25 in. travel for tripping the firing pin, so the firing time from the computer model was taken as the time for the seismic mass to traverse Table 1 - Comparison of Computer and Test Results Case ap,g t£, ms tm, ms 1 8.0 41.0 43.5 2 8.7 38.0 39.0 3 6.6 47.4 47.0 4 6.0 54.7 53.0 0.25 in. plus the time for the firing pin to travel 1 in. after it had been released. The parameter values used in the firing pin model were: Mp = 2.33 X 10 4 slug mp = 6.85 X 10"^ slug Kp = 25.2 lb/ft Kpx0 = 3.25 lb This model, time scaled 1000: 1, showed a constant 3.2 ms to traverse the 1 in., regardless of the external acceleration profile (up to 8 g). The negligible effect of external acceleration is easily seen since the spring preload is nearly 500 g. This constant 3.2 ms was added to the time required by the seismic mass to travel the required trip distance for all results shown in this section. The time required to release the balls restraining the firing pin was considered negligible. The parameters used for the test comparision and all subsequent runs were as measured on the test accelerom- eter: M = 3.1 X 10~3 slug m = 3.22 X IO"4 slug K = 3.96 lb/ft Kx0 = 0.31b /¿Mg = 0.2191b The results of the test comparison runs are listed in Table 1. All acceleration profiles were half sine waves of 78 ms dura- tion, and the peak values listed under a . The values under t P c represent the computer times, and those under t the times measured on the test runs. These results show very good correlation, indicating the analog computer model is a reason- ably accurate representation of the actual sensor. The small differences are random in nature and could very well be due in part to the fact that the test acceleration profiles were not precise sine waves. DESIGN TRADEOFF STUDIES - Numerous runs were made to determine the effects of input and/or device parameter variations. These tests and results are described in the follow- ing paragraphs.

These results are plotted in Fig. 4. The hyperbolic shape of these curves occurs from the fact that as the period gets shorter, the peak g required to trigger increases as the period approaches zero. On the other end, as the period gets longer, the peak g to trigger asympotically approach the combined frictional and spring preload, or about 5 g. Trigger Times versus Weight of Seismic Mass - In another set of runs, the weight of the seismic mass was varied and the time to trigger (for 0.1875 in. travel) noted for an 8 g, 80 ms half sine wave input with spring preloads of 0.25 and 0.3 lb. These results are shown in Fig. 5. As the mass is doubled (from 0.1-0.2 lb), a fairly significant decrease in Fig. 6 - Effect of spring preload on trigger time trigger time from 6-8 ms is noted. However, as the mass is further increased, the reduction in trigger time becomes fairly insignificant. Effect of Spring Preload on Trigger Time - These runs were made for a device with the following parameters: M = 3.774 X 10"3 slug K = 4.28 lb/ft KxQ = 2.66 lb (nominal) /¿Mg = 0.2191b An 8 g, 80 ms half sine acceleration input was inserted and trigger times for 0.125, 0.250, and 0.50 in. travels were noted for preloads from 0.0-6 g (the mass traveled less than 0.25 in. in the 6 g case). It is desirable to keep the preload as low as possible to reduce trigger time. However, since the friction level is fairly high for this particular sen- sor, this represents the limitation on reducing the preload, since the spring must overcome the friction in returning the mass to zero for nonfiling cases. The results are plotted in Fig. 6. AIR CUSHION INFLATION MODEL A mathematical model of the gas dynamics of the infla- tion of the air cushion has been developed using standard gas dynamics principles. The blow down process of the gas supply reservoir through its orifice follows the treat- ment developed in Owczarek (3). Additional thermo- dynamic relationships needed were taken from Van Wylen (6).

Fig. 7 is a schematic of the fully inflated model with the pertinent input parameters. A pressure reservoir of volume "U" is filled with cold gas nitrogen or air at high pressure. Upon sensor activation an orifice "DIAOR" opens to a plenum or dis- tribution manifold of volume "UB." The gas expands into the lower compartment of the air cushion from this mani- fold when a release pressure is exceeded. The differential pressure on the surface of the cushion forces it outward. The air cushion is fixed at its base (SLTWD) and is assumed to develop in a series of semicircles until a diameter equal to the dimension "BAGHT" is obtained. If a single compartment bag is being modeled, the orifice "DIAEO" represents a vent to atmosphere. If a double compartment bag is being modeled, it represents an orifice between the two compartments. Flow between the com- partments begins when the orifice "DIAEO" is exposed and a control pressure is exceeded. The upper compartment develops as a triangle with semi- circular base. When the inflation model is introduced into the occupant dynamics simulation, the upper compartment acts to restrain the head and the lower compartment acts to restrain Table 2 - Nomenclature: Terms Used in the Equations to Describe the Air Cushion Inflation Process Variables Subscripts A-area am-ambient C-drag coefficient b-in the lower cushion E-modulus of elasticity of c-mean cross section of wall cushion material material g-acceleration due to gravity e-lower cushion vent condi- H-height of cushion tions M-mass of cushion M-molecular m-mass of gas o-initial P-pressure r-reservoir R-universal gas constant p_in the plenum T-temperature s-sides of the cushion t-time t-in the throat U-gas velocity t-top of the cushion V-volume w-walls of the reservoir AV-increase in cushion volume wb-walls of the cushion W-molecular weight bt-in the upper cushion w-width of cushion br-retuming to the lower cush- x-position of cushion top ion 7-specific heat ratio lr-returning to the upper cush- p-density ion 6-strain in the cushion material e2-upper cushion vent condi- I-moment of inertia of top of tions upper cushion -Angle of top of upper cushion with respect to top of lower cushion the chest. A second single compartment bag provides knee restraint. A flow chart for the air cushion inflation program is shown in Fig. 8. This program can be used in itself to determine reservoir and bag pressures and temperatures as well as flow parameters in an air cushion system. Its inclusion in the occupant dynamics simulation provides the means for calculat- ing restraint forces on the occupant. Nomenclature used in the following discussion is shown in Table 2.

Using the enthalpy equations the temperature of the gas in the cushion compart- ments can be determined.

OCCUPANT-AIR CUSHION KINEMATICS MODEL For the analytical approach to the design of the automobile safety air cushion restraint system, the model of an air cushion restraint system was incorporated into the planar version of the Cornell Occupant Kinematics Model developed by Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc. (5). This is an eleven degree of freedom model of an automobile occupant for digital computer simulation of crash victim dynamics. Either experimental or idealized time history of vehicle deceleration can be employed as the forcing function. The planar version of this model, depicted in Fig. 10, characterized the windshield, chest target,</page><page sequence="8">70 F. J. IRISH, ET AL. Fig. 11 - Cornell model contact force system. Model assumes that the occupant can be represented by contact spheres with associated masses upper and lower instrument panels, floor, and toe board as planes and simulation of both belted and unbelted occupants. The model assumes that the occupant can be represented by eight contact spheres with associated masses, which are shown in Fig. 1 1 . Impact surfaces are characterized by nonlinear load deflection profiles. The existing cushion inflation model program was incor- porated into this planar version of the Cornell model. This was accomplished by incorporating the inflation program into the program as a set of subroutines (two sets required; one for the head-chest area, and a second for the knee). In effect, we replace the nonlinear load deflection characteristics for the head, chest, and knee by forces generated by inflation pressures in the air cushion. Upon contact between occupant and air cushion, the spec- ially written set of subroutines are used to: 1 . Determine the type of contact with the air cushions, that is, head, chest, or knee respectively. 2. Calculate the forces of contact and the angle of contact to be passed to the* Cornell program and the change of volume in the bag to be passed to the inflation program. Thus, the interaction consists of the human model altering the volume of the air cushion and the air cushion exerting forces on the human model. As currently programmed, ten- sion forces on the human model are accounted for by a multiplicative factor in the calculation of contact area. This approach should be justified by further experimental data. The contact model is concerned with computation of the forces P2, P3» P 3» P4, P4, P5, P 5, and the contact angles ^2' ^3' ^4' an(* ^6' depicted *n 12. Fig. 12 - Contact force system with air cushions. Occupant forces are generated by a dual compartment upper cushion and a single compart- ment lower cushion There are six modes of operation for the program; the forces and contact angles to be modified depend upon the mode. The six modes of operation are: 0th Mode- Standard planar Cornell model with no bags active. 1st Mode- Driver mode with one bag installed to protect the chest from impact with the steering wheel. 2nd Mode- Passenger mode with one double bag, that is, a bag that has an upper cushion used to protect the head from colliding with either the windshield, or the upper instrument panel, and a lower cushion to protect the chest. 3rd Mode- Driver mode with one single bag for the chest and another single bag for the knees. 4th Mode- Passenger mode with one double bag whose upper cushion is for the head and whose lower cushion is for the chest, and with one single bag for the knees. 5th Mode- Passenger or driver mode with a single bag for the knees. It is to be noted that where a contact surface has not been replaced by an air cushion, the forces on the head, chest, or knee are computed by the standard nonlinear force deflection routine in the planar version of the Cornell model. A schematic of these modes is shown in Fig. 13. The contact model is illustrated by considering the impact of a chest sphere with an air cushion. The single compartment air cushion is a half cylinder combined with a wedge (see top view of Fig. 15. Fig. 14 is a side view of the chest sphere in contact with the cushion).

GRAPHICS DISPLAY A substantial effort was devoted to developing computer programs which permit efficient systems design studies using IBM 360/65 and 2250 graphics. The great advantage of a computer graphics program as compared with a batch mode- type program is that the model parameter values can be changed as the analyst wishes via the graphics keyboard. This avoids the lengthy turnaround time encountered in batch mode processing. On the graphics console, the effects of a parameter value change can be visually ascertained in a matter of minutes by typing in one set of parameters, examining the display, then typing in another set of values and examining that display. Fig. 16 shows a user at the graphics console with light pen on a particular parameter value which he wishes to change. He will then use the keyboard to enter the new value. The light Fig. 1 6 - A user at the graphics console with light pen indicating a particular parameter value he wishes to change pen may then be used either to initiate another parameter value change or to select another model for solution and display. In order to utilize acceleration data from actual crash and environmental test programs, the study has required the development of several interactive versions of the modeling programs: 1 . Read, display, and edit crash acceleration data tape. 2. Read, display, and edit noncrash acceleration data tapes. 3. Filter acceleration data. 4. Solve 2d order differential equation. 5. Solve gas flow equations. 6. Display sensor model solution and equation parameter values. 7. Display inflation and cushion model solution and system parameter values.

Reservoir pressure is the most readily measured indication of cushion inflation model accuracy The graphics displays and programs described above were implemented on the 360/65 at Delco Electronics in Santa Barbara. A comparable set has not been implemented to date at the Tech Center in Warren. However, advantage was taken of a previously written "stick man" graphics package implemented by the Vehicle Research Department at the GM Research Laboratories. This package was modified to include a schematic of the expanding air bag during a crash event as well as the motion of the occupant. In addition to the "stick man" graphics, x - y plots of any of the 130 normal output variables against each other can also be obtained. Work is under way to plot the air cushion parameters in the same fashion. CORRELATION OF MODEL PREDICTIONS WITH TEST PERFORMANCE Several tests were conducted to measure the degree of correlation obtained with the various portions of the math model. Correlation of the sensor model has been discussed previously. Correlation tests of the cushion inflation portion of the model will be compared with prediction and conclusions drawn. Finally, correlation tests performed on the GM Proving Ground Safety Research &amp; Development Laboratory Hyge impact sled to evaluate the complete model will be discussed. CUSHION INFLATION MODEL CORRELATION - The cushion inflation model can be studied by first looking at the pressurized gas reservoir and its associated "blow down" during the inflation process and second, the inflating air cushion coupled to the gas reservoir. The important param- eters when dealing with reservoir "blow down" are the mass of the gas which has flowed out of the reservoir and the prop- erties of the gas; that is, velocity, static pressure, and tempera- ture. Because of the difficulty involved in accurately measuring these parameters with respect to time, it was decided that reservoir pressure would be the most reliable indication of model prediction accuracy. A schematic of the test arrange- ment is shown in Fig. 19.</page><page sequence="12">74 F. J. IRISH, ET AL.

A Kistler piezoelectric pressure transducer was placed in the end of the pressure reservoir to eliminate gas velocity errors. The Eaton Yale and Towne valve was activated with two E-1B electric detonators and lag times of 4 ms were measured on this and other tests for the valve. The reservoir was pressurized to 3500 psi with dry nitrogen and the valve activated with a 12 V signal. The resulting reservoir pressure blow down curve from this test is shown in Fig. 20 along with the math model predicted values. The steps in the measured pressure trace come from a reflecting wave phenomena inside of the pressure reservoir (4). Correlation is shown to be quite good between model prediction and measured results when an orifice coeffi- cient of 1 .0 is used with the model. Several tests were conducted with similar but larger valve orifice diameters including 1.10 and 1.30 in. diameters. The resulting pressure reservoir blow down curves along with math model predicted results are shown in Fig. 21. Predicted inflation times have been correlated by noting the time of occupant force buildup from the cushion during sled tests. Also, fill times obtained from high-speed film analysis have generally agreed with cushion inflation prediction. Techniques are currently being developed to further check the inflation model by measuring cushion temperatures and pressures directly.

The test was conducted at the GM Proving Ground Safety Research and Development Laboratory on the Hyge sled. The test buck consisted of a standard size car body. A 50th percentile male anthropomorphic dummy (Alderson VIP-50) seated in the mid-position of seat travel on the passenger side of the front seat was used for the test. Dummy instrumentation included head and chest triaxial accelerometers and femur load transducers. The input parameters for both the sled and math model as well as the measured and predicted occupant kinematics results are shown in Fig. 22. The sequence of events taken from a high-speed, on-board camera (attached to sled test buck) is shown in Fig. 23 compared with the math model predicted kinematics. CONCLUSIONS - Math model predictions showed good correlation with measured reservoir pressure during the infla- tion process when an orifice coefficient of 1 .0 was used instead of the usual 0.6 for a sharp-edged orifice. This can be ex- plained because nitrogen deviates from an "ideal gas" at the pressures and temperatures encountered during reservoir blow down.

Relationship of mass ratio, pressure ratio, and orifice area to reservoir volume ratio with time o process. At 20 ms after reservoir opening with a 202 in. reservoir and 1.0 in. diameter orifice, the pressure is 1540 psi and the gas temperature in the reservoir is 429 R resulting in a compressibility factor of 0.93. Also, while the specific heat ratio 7 is initially 1 .4, it changes during blow down, and at 20 ms is 1.8 (2). The changes in compressibility factor and specific heat ratio would account for a larger than normal orifice coefficient required to make math model prediction agree with experimental results. Predicted air cushion pressures agreed quite well with experimental measurements. Also, it was found that occu- pant kinematics could be predicted reasonably well with the math model, rendering it useful as a design tool. Effort is continuing toward making the modeled air cushion shapes more closely represent actual air cushion shapes. DESIGN APPLICATIONS An important aspect of air cushion design is proper sizing of the pressure vessel to the air cushion. Factors such as cushion size and desired deployment time dictate the reservoir volume, reservoir pressure, and exit orifice size. Fig. 24 shows how the parameters of mass of gas flowed out of the reservoir, reservoir volume, and reservoir orifice area are related with time. The chart can be used in the following manner. Suppose a 5.0 ft^ cushion is required to be filled to 4 psi in 30 ms: Cushion volume = 5.0 ft^ Cushion pressure = 18.7 psia Cushion assumed temperature = -30 F = 430 R Gas to be used = N2 (nitrogen) The pressure x volume of the cushion is: PV = (18.7) (144) (5.0) = 13,500 ft-lb</page><page sequence="14">76 F.

The modified Planar Cornell Occupant Kinematics Program with implemented air cushion provides a tool that can be used to study the complete vehicle, occupant, air cushion interaction during a frontal crash.

Similarly, Table 7 is an input-output sum- mary for an air cushion design evaluation. Table 8 then represents the synthesis of the sensor, air cushion, and vehicle characteristics into an occupant kinematics simulation which can be used as an overall design evaluation. These four phases are shown schematically in Fig. 25. SUMMARY This study, while concentrating primarily on the develop- ment of analysis tools rather than the performance of various designs, has led to some preliminary conclusions. 1 . The vehicle crush simulation is an effective means of obtaining vehicle deceleration curves. 2. The crash sensor simulation permits an accurate estimate of the effect of sensor design parameters on trigger time. 3. The air cushion inflation model gives reasonable values for pressure, temperature, and mass in the supply reservoir as well as in the air cushion. 4. The revised occupant kinematics model is a useful tool for evaluation of alternate air cushion restraint systems. 5 . All of the models individually and in combination pro- vide a comprehensive design analysis capability useful in the evaluation of air cushion restraint systems. This capability permits parameter studies of a wide range of vehicle, sensor, inflation, and occupant combinations, thus reducing the time and number of hardware tests required to converge on the most optimum system configuration. 6. Improvements in cushion pressure and temperature measurement techniques are needed to permit more accurate correlation of the air cushion model.
