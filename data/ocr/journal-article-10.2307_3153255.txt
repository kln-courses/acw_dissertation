But it must explain the fragmentary statement that is here made of Dr. Class's position. It is only in so far as the book bears upon the prob- lem we have referred to that I have tried to criticise it. From this standpoint it is easy to see what has been done and has been left out. If I am not mistaken the author has simply turned the problem around and affirmed it instead of offering any solution, i. e., he has asserted simply that the individual is the essential expression of the meaning of the universe, that he is the carrier and essence of it, that therefore the individual peculiarities which are found within him must have also an ultimate logical statement in the movement of the thought process. He has felt that these individual peculiarities are to be expressed in the very movement of social life, not in static entities that lie outside this movement. But he has not done more in his statement, so far as I can read out the meaning of his system, than shut the whole problem up in his postulates. He postulates the individualities, he does not account for them either metaphysically or logically. The best part of the book is the phenomenology, which is full of acute and profound observations upon the ethical value of the individ- ual, in his development and in his relations to society. THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. GEORGE H. MEAD. THE PHILOSOPHY OF BELIEF, OR LAW IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY. By the DUKE OF ARGYLL, K.G., K.T. New York: Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons, I896. Pp. 555; cloth. $5. THIS is the third work in a series of which The Reign of Law, i866, and The Unity of Nature, I884, by the same author, are the other two, and The Philosophy of Belief is based upon the conclusions reached in these. Its apparent aim is to show that the principles and doctrines set forth in the Scriptures are the same in character with the presup- positions and discoveries of science and philosophy, and hence fur- nish a rational ground for an acceptance of Christian teaching and an explanation of its success in the world. The first division of the book treats of Intuitive Theology. It is said, we perceive in Nature, which is "a name for the sum of all existence, visible and invisible," "the essential qualities of mind as distinguished from the qualities of matter and of the physical forces." The ubiquitous presence of mental agency is recognized by men uni- 792</page><page sequence="2">RECENT THEOLOGICAL LITERA TURE versally; not by mediate inference, however, but it is photographed, so to speak, upon the sensitive organism of the human mind; and com- mon modes of speech prove it, for language is a faithful picture of thought. The main characteristic of that Mind seen in nature is pre- vision, design, purposiveness, which has significance only as inhering in personality. This is intuitive theology; for the untrained and unsophisticated thinker, unaware of the artificial distinction between nature and the supernatural, and unconsciously assuming nature to be a unit and himself to be a part of nature, regards himself as in some sense a product of that Living Power seen in the world, and as in some degree like to it. Here religion begins. The language of science involves the same conceptions as underlie common speech. Attempts have been made by such able men as Cuvier, Huxley, and Spencer to denude the language of scientific description of all teleological, i. e., theological, implications, but the complete failure of such efforts proves that "the indelible impressions which nature makes upon the receptive and unconscious mind," allied with the speech-making faculty in man, are too powerful to be destroyed by theories or personal predilections. In their writings the common occurrence of expressions which are "literally charged with teleological presupposition," e. g., "function," "structure," "plan," "homology," "survival of the fittest," "conformity to type," makes it evident that the question of the Why? as well as of the How? of things is inseparable from the study of nature, and that any statement of its facts implies a "mental motive" as explaining the operations of one reasoning intelligence to another intelligence. But with the recognition of Mind in nature we are yet only on the threshold of theology. A multitude of questions at once arise,- questions as to the ultimate aim of the works of that Intelligent Being, the extent of that Contriving Power, his relations to those moral qualities which are the highest in our own nature, and such like,- and the utter failure of all mythological and metaphysical systems to satisfy these cravings is evidence that the solution of the problem of "our own relations with that Personal Mind in nature" must be found in some other way. Without such solution there cannot be actual reli- gion, for while the one fundamental fact already noted affords a start- ing point for religion, it does no more. But the very consciousness of ethical and spiritual faculties in ourselves and the instinctive desire to know their significance implies that an answer to our questionings can be given. It will be consistent with those conceptions already 793</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY obtained and as self-evidently true, because the unity of nature depends upon that Mind with which we feel ourselves related. The declarations of "The Theology of the Hebrews" touching the character of the Godhead and the nature of man are next examined. The Old Testament is treated as a consistent whole. God is a living person, Author and Governor of the world, working out a purpose and making use of natural causes (even in miracles) as means. One divine law pervades all things. The "irrational distinction" between the natural and the supernatural is not found in Hebrew thought. Nature is intelligible and its laws are moral, - Hebrew theology herein differentiating itself from all other ancient religions and philosophies, -but all is the expression of a reasonable and righteous divine will. The law of God is the "highest object of human knowledge, next to the personal God whose will it is," and it is reverentially regarded as an expression of his personal character. Hence Hebrew theology is " anthropopsychic " rather than anthropomorphic, because man is really theopsychic. God's will can be known as truth, and through it intelligent communion with God may be enjoyed. Vast vistas of progress, that is, foreviews of the operations of God's will in the world, are presented to the gaze of some (prophets) who enter into special experiences of that communion. The law of God shall triumph over corruption in the world. The kingdom of the world shall be God's and the blessedness of it shall be man's; and as the end is thus personal, so the means to be used is more and more clearly seen as a Person, who is to exhibit God's law in its fullness and bring the world to a willing subjection to it. This is the highest point of Hebrew theology. " Perfect continuity exists between the fundamental conceptions of Hebrew theology and those of Christian doctrine," only the universal reign of law is more consciously avowed in the latter. Human reason is appealed to as capable of judging of relations between the divine and the human, of Jesus' fitness to be Messiah, of the truth or falsity of worship, of the harmony of the incarnation and self-sacrifice of Christ with man's deepest moral qualities and needs. Faith is no mere intellectual conviction, nor is it the opposite of intellectual doubt, but the highest exercise of the reason perceiving and accepting the moral nature of God as containing the law of human life and the satisfaction of its wants. Inspiration is intuition, "an unusually direct impulse from God," and "according to the natural constitu- tion and course of things ;" it is to be tested by the understanding. 794</page><page sequence="4">RECENT THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE Regeneration is a moral change effected through apprehension of the truth and therefore taking place according to the eternal laws of God's kingdom. Even doctrines, such as the Trinity, which fall back upon the authority of a teacher, respect the reason in that it is accorded the right to test the teacher's authority. Similarly, of Christian ethics. Its precepts appear, not as mere arbitrary commands, but as having their origin in the very nature of things. This is illustrated in its doctrine of rewards, as it appears, for example, in the Beatitudes. The Golden Rule of Christ rests upon an instinctive standard by which motive is to be tested. But the dis- tinctive peculiarity of Christian ethics is that it supplies a motive found nowhere else, -"love and loyalty to a personal incarnation of the divine nature." That is, because Christ died for mankind, the claims of all men are identified with the claims of Christ; and what is this but the realization of man's union with God ? The Christian doctrine of prayer rests upon the conception of the universe as one harmonious system, pervaded by one law, controlled by one free personality for a purpose, that purpose requiring for its fulfillment the employment of means of which prayer is a portion. The true purpose of God and the rightful aim of man are identical. The New Testament teaching that our relationship to God is "closer than that of sonship-some relation of absolute derivation for which we have no name," makes it "intelligible why it is in the nature of man to pray, and why it is in the nature of God to hear." Thus while reason furnishes the norm for an intelligible explana- tion of nature, Christianity supplies the material. "Christian belief as a system of philosophy" satisfies the human mind. The book is well written. There is scarcely a dull paragraph in it. It is suggestive and inspiring. The author's penetrating knowledge of the Scriptures must have come from long and loving meditation. But his psychology is weak and leads to inconsistencies. A work of such wide range invites much criticism. However it will suffice here to indicate just one point: Christian theology is not Christian faith. A man becomes a Christian in many cases before he understands the philosophy which may underlie Christianity. The secret of the power of Christianity is not that it gives a satisfying "account of the consti- tution of the universe and of man's relation to it," but that it presents a Christ who satisfies the conscience and becomes our assurance of per- sonal acceptance and fellowship with God.
