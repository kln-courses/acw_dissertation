New York: Oxford University Press, American Branch (1 92 ) . Pp. xvi + 434. Those who have found in the sane and profound scholarship of Dr. Farnell their most trustworthy guide to the study of the Greek gods and their worship will welcome this volume as a long-desired supple- ment to his Cults of the Greek States. The author</page><page sequence="2">182 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY [VOL. XVII, No. 23, WHOLE No. 473 does not aim at encyclopedic completeness, but is content to refer the investigator of the less significant names to Roscher's Lexikon der Griechischen and Romischen Mythologie. His principal object in this work has been (Preface, v). . . .to reduce the chaotic mass of facts to some order, by defining the categories under which the different hero-personalities may be classified, and to discuss under each the salient examples and those of whom something of interest for religion, history or psy- chology may be proved or surmised. . . . The book opens with a brief and judicious General Survey of the Prehistoric Period (I-I8), which does justice to the scanty but trustworthy evidence for the worship of great personages of the 'Minoan' age after death, and for the existence in the Homeric age of ghost-worship and of certain glorified personages who received divine or semidivine honors. The lack of prominence of such cults Dr. Farnell rightly ascribes to the fact that the poet "reflects the tone of an in- tellectual aristocracy" less concerned with death than with the business of living (II-12). Chapter II deals with Heroes and Heroines of Divine or Daimoniac Origin (19-52). These are figures be- longing to the domain of vegetation and agriculture, some of them marked by myths reflecting a vegetation- ritual. In connection with them the author makes a sensible protest (51) against the rash generalization that all myths are based on ritual, and utters a caution- would that more investigators would heed it-to those who expect too much from a single method or theory in the study of mythology. The discussion of Sacral Heroes and Heroines (Chapter III: 53-7o) is note- worthy because of the author's decided disinclination to apply to such figures as Iphigenia and Amphiaraos the convenient theory of the 'faded god', and for his frank readiness to recognize them as human person- alities. Chapter IV (Functional Heroes and `Sonder-Gotter' : 71-94) contains a well-reasoned and on the whole con- vincing criticism of the theory set forth by Usener, in his Gotternamen, which is, briefly, that the Greeks and other Indo-European peoples passed through a period when the objects of worship were narrowly specialized beings with limited functions, usually described by a significant name. Dr. Farnell concedes that in the history of the race animism probably preceded theism and polytheism, and is aware of the evidence for ani- conic cults; but he insists upon the point (which Usener does not deny) that "the Hellenic perception of divinity had become concrete and precise at a very early period". The 'Sonder-gott' names, in his opinion, owe their origin in some cases to religious reserve, or hesitation to use the true name of a divinity ; in others they are emanations from higher divinities, thrown off "as suns may throw off satellites" ; and he denies that they necessarily precede the anthropomorphic stage of worship. There are three chapters dealing with Herakles- the origin and diffusion of his cult (95-145), his func- tions (146-154), and his ritual (155-174)-which, despite their manifest interest and importance, can- not be considered in detail in a review. Outstanding features of Dr. Farnell's treatment of the hero are (1) his insistence upon the primary fact of his man- hood, and his denial of the aboriginal divinity of Herakles, which is asserted by Herodotus and main- tained by various modern scholars; (2) his refusal to accept the Dorian claim to Herakles, whom he regards as an Hellenic hero. There is also an interesting digression (125-131) in which the author rejects the view (accepted by Miss Harrison) that the "Idaean Herakles" was a real personality of Cretan religion. Chapter VIII (575-228) deals with the difficult problem of The Dioskouroi. The author concludes that they were human, and Laconian in origin, not `faded gods', nor "pre-ethnic daimones. . .bringing with them the unindividualized names of 'Sons of God' " (223). After a brief treatment of The Leukip- pides (229-233), and a valuable chapter on The Cult of Asklepios (234-279), the author concludes the work with four closely related chapters (XI-XIV) on The Cults of Epic Heroes (28o-342), The Cults of Ances- tors (343-360), Cults of Real Persons in the Historic Period (365-372), and Individual Belief in Immortality : the Mysteries and Orphism (373-402). Here the un- prejudiced reader will find little to criticise, much to instruct and elicit admiration. At the end there are references, alphabetically listed (403-426), for the cults of the various classes of heroes, on the plan of those which form so valuable a part of The Cults of the Greek States. This survey of the plan and the scope of the book does scant justice to the erudition upon which the work is soundly based, and still less to the author's illuminating reflections upon the social and the ethical consequences of the worship of heroes and ancestors and the belief in immortality. But they are best stated by Dr. Farnell himself. This notice will have served its purpose if it brings more readers to this excellent book. Nothing stands out more strikingly throughout the work than the author's emphasis upon the contribution which the custom of honoring the dead, especially the great dead, has made to the development of Greek religion. `If this be Euhemerism', he might say, `make the most of it'. In this matter he is in accord with the most trustworthy findings of anthropological research. To one who, like the reviewer, believes firmly in the value of anthropology and folk-lore for the study of ancient civilization, it is especially pleasing to see that so exact a scholar as Dr. Farnell is as far from the contemptuous indifference which some of our Hellenists display toward these subjects, as he is from the unrestrained vagaries of certain modern worshippers of Year-Daemon and Grain-Spirit. As regards type and paper, the book is all that could be desired; but there are more minor errors than one usually detects in an Oxford book, and not all of them can be laid to the printer's charge.
