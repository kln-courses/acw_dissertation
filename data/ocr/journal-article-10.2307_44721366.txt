PROTECTION OF THE DRIVER in a car crash deserves high priority because the driver position is always occupied and be- cause the United States average occupancy is about two per- sons. Further, providing survivable decelerations at barrier frontal impact speeds approaching 50 mph is now a legitimate goal because compartment integrity has been demonstrated at high speeds.(l)* These vehicle crashworthiness results are briefly reviewed, and the implications of energy management structures for restraint systems are discussed. An authoritative treatment of driver restraint in typical cur- rent vehicle structures is presented in Ref. 2. Background con- *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. siderations vis-à-vis passive and active restraints also were de- scribed in Ref. 2 and will not be repeated here. An additional reason for emphasizing the driver position is that it probably is impractical to provide that position with a rearward-facing seat- a survival solution demonstrated in con- junction with crashworthy structures (3). This particular demonstration was just that- a controlled test to show that loads on anthropomorphic devices could be kept within rea- sonable limits in a high-speed impact. Figs. 1 and 2 (3) show the measured accelerations on two 50% male anthropomor- phic devices seated (unrestrained) in a rearward-facing seat in- stalled in a Mod. 1D3 vehicle impacted into a pole at 57.3 mph (test 66 under Contract FH-1 1-7622). Head Severity In- dexes (SI) are inset on the head resultant acceleration curves. The excellent results obtained- both the accelerations and the ABSTRACT - A major consideration for passive restraints is the accommo- dation of a range of driver masses in conjunction with a range of impact speeds. A particular velocity -sensitive absorber is introduced that is intended to provide the required dissipation within currently recommended force limits. It is shown that retention of current typical compartment dimensions sug- gests that the stroke required at speeds near 60 mph will be difficult to accommodate. Illustrative examples of the velocity-sensitive restraint sub- jected to the deceleration pulse of a vehicle having an energy management structure are presented. The vehicles repre- sented are those developed by Calspan Corp. under Depart- ment of Transportation (DOT) sponsorship. They feature compartment integrity during impacts with fixed objects at speeds in excess of 50 mph. Special features of a candidate passive driver restraint system include a déployable hydraulic energy absorber of the type analyzed and an absorber that permits lateral motion of the occupant. Tentative conclusions of the study are: 1. Driver restraint systems effective for a range of driver masses (5% female to 95% male) can be developed. 2. Use of a velocity (and velocity squared) sensitive device can complicate the conventional view of ride-down enhance- ment. 3. Both passive and active systems can be made effective at speeds around 50 mph (within the constraints of current com- partment dimensions). 4. Energy management vehicle structures- mandatory for maintenance of compartment integrity- are compatible with postulated restraint characteristics.

Several topics are covered in the following sections. After the brief description of one type of crashworthy structure, vehicle/ occupant relationships are noted and emphasis is placed upon the resulting energy absorption requirements. A discussion of the calculated performance of a velocity-sensi- tive occupant decelerator* is presented in terms of the ve- hicle structures mentioned. Finally, elements of a possible driver restraint system are postulated that appear to satisfy the restraint performance items of driver positioning, energy ab- sorption, and ride-down enhancement. ENERGY MANAGEMENT VEHICLES Structures developed at Calspan under National Highway Traffic Safety (NHTSA) sponsorship (Contract No. FH-1 1- 7622) feature a considerable reduction in passenger compart- ment intrusions compared to those of conventional vehicles while maximum decelerations are nominally unchanged. Re- sults for luxury, full-sized, compact, and subcompact vehicles are summarized in Ref. 3. A brief description of the struc- tural components for the full-sized class of vehicles is given below. The overall full-sized vehicle design is illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4, where frame and body structures, respectively, are shown. A brief description of the various structural compo- nents and the rationale behind their incorporation into the automobile are subsequently provided. These descriptions are, of course, keyed to the illustrations of Figs. 3 and 4. BUMPER SYSTEM- A C-shaped bumper face bar with closed upper and lower sections and overall dimensions of 7-1/4 X 4 in was made from 4130, 0.100 in thick sheet steel. A 4 X 4 in cross-sectional ure thane foam is encased in the face bar and backed up against the first frame cross member. Bumper frame attachment allows the urethane to compress and dissipate nearly all vehicular kinetic energy during low- speed collisions (up to speeds slightly in excess of 8 mph) with fixed objects and then return the face bar to preimpact posi- tion. FRAME - The frame modifications were made from 0.120 in thick mild steel and relate to a current full-sized Ford frame. Original S-frame siderails were unchanged except for small ex- tensions to ensure proper positioning of the first cross member and upsets to provide effective bumper/frame engagement. The section properties of the siderails beneath the passenger compartment were slightly increased. Major changes were re- quired in the first four frame cross members. The first and second members were moved forward from their original positions and interconnected by a number of additional longi- tudinal members. These forward frame alterations are in- tended to increase greatly the energy absorption (dissipation) * Constant-force restraints are treated in some of the ref- erenced literature. capacity of the frame during frontal collisions. The third cross member was redesigned to span the frame siderails and is chiefly intended to provide increased energy absorption during lateral collisions. It is, however, designed to serve a dual role so that during frontal collisions, small but important spreading of the frame siderails occurs. The fourth cross member was redesigned to connect the rear torque boxes, and its sole func- tion is to improve lateral impact performance. ENGINE/TRANSMISSION MOUNTS - Original engine/trans- mission mounts were retained, but to facilitate engine down- ward motion during frontal collisions, a section of the original second cross member beneath the engine was removed. Also, the transmission mount was cantilevered off of the third cross member. FRONT FENDERS AND GRILLE - To improve crash load distribution during intervehicular collisions, an aluminum grating grille was placed across the front of the vehicle. This grille is supported by reinforced inner fenders that provide for belt-line level loading on the passenger compartment and in- creased energy absorption during frontal collisions. The entire structure is stabilized with a multiple latched hood. Mild thin- gage sheet steel (thickness range from 0.040-0.060 in) was used in all inner fender modifications. FIREWALL AND TUNNEL - The original firewall and floor- pan were replaced with a sandwich panel structure having thin (0.040 in thick) 4130 steel skins and a bonded aluminum honeycomb core. The tunnel was reshaped to deflect the engine/transmission during severe frontal collisions. A mating ramp was also placed on the transmission bell housing. The primary function of the high-strength firewall is to limit intru- sion of engine house components into the passenger compart- ment during severe frontal collisions. PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - Localized reinforcements were applied to the A- and C-pillars, while original B-pillars were replaced with members having substantially greater strength. The lower ends of the B-pillars were designed to overlap the frame siderails, providing pillar/frame engagement during more severe lateral collisions. Additional lateral sup- port results from the roll bar connecting the upper ends of the B-pillars. The principal function of the pillar modifications was to provide an effective means of distributing impact forces to major structural elements of the passenger compartments. DOOR BEAMS - To reduce door vulnerability during lateral collisions, sandwich panel beams were installed in all doors. These beams, made from mild (0.035 in thick) sheet steel, were designed so that after initial collapse due to bending, large tensile (cabling) forces would be transmitted to the pillars spanned by the beam. This was accomplished by attaching the beam ends to the door hinges and T-slot elbow connectors on the latch side of the door. In order to engage the elbow con- nectors, mating slots were, of course, built into the respective door latch side pillars. It should be noted that the original latches were retained for the purpose of securing the doors. The modified doors are also expected to provide increased passenger compartment longitudinal strength during frontal collisions.

The forward body /frame mount, originally located at the front torque boxes, was moved forward to a position just ahead of the front suspension pockets. Additional mounts were installed at the C-pillars. These mounts, as a result of the frame siderails, direct part of frontal impact forces to the rear of the passenger compartment, resulting in a more neutral stress condition in the structure than would occur if all forces were imparted to the firewall region. VEHICLE FRONTAL IMPACT PERFORMANCE - Crash performance achieved is indicated by the comparison of ac- celerations experienced by modified and unmodified vehicles in Fig. 5 (4). Shown in Fig. 5 are average longitudinal kinematic data for the conventional 1972 Ford and the OV-IIR vehicles. The vehicles were impacted into the pole barrier at the same speed (57.8 mph and 56.8 mph). The modified vehicle (OV-IIR) ex- hibits a much shorter rise time and significantly more energy absorption (dissipation) during the first 0.050 s of the colli- sion. As a result, considerably less displacement takes place in the modified vehicle than in the conventional vehicle. This difference in displacement is directly related to vehicular structural collapse, as is graphically illustrated in Figs. 6 A and 6B, where similar views of both structures are presented. Collapse mechanisms designed into the structures provide similar acceleration time histories in frontal pole and barrier impacts (see Fig. 5-3 of Ref. 4). Pole impacts at different speeds (40 and 56.8 mph) indicate that lesser peak compart- ment accelerations are experienced if the engine does not con- tact the fire wall- that is, at 40 mph impact speed (Fig. 7). Overall, then, the energy management structures have dem- onstrated compartment integrity at speeds as high as 60 mph. Acceleration wave forms show high onset rates, good stroke efficiency, and mean levels around 40 g. VEHICLE PULSE/OCCUPANT RIDE-DOWN RELATIONSHIP Questions about the effect of vehicle crash pulse character- istics on occupant response have been treated in the literature (5-8). One of the main results derived from the analyses is the possible reduction of occupant loads by ride-down, wherein the occupant is in contact with the vehicle interior before its velocity reaches zero. Generally, earlier contact leads to lower severity for the occupant. LOWER VELOCITY LIMIT FOR RIDE-DOWN - For a ve- hicle having a constant acceleration crush characteristic Ay and a restraint introducing a constant occupant deceleration AQ, it can be shown (8) that a ride-down benefit can be obtained only when the occupant separation distance is less than the vehicle crush distance. Driver separation distance b is the dis- tance from his chest to the steering wheel; Fig. 8 shows how it is related to the minimum speed at which a benefit is obtained. The case indicated is one in which the driver chest is 10-1/2 in from the steering hub, and three vehicle acceleration levels are shown. No ride-down is obtained for the following conditions: 1. Ay = 20 g, V &lt; 33 ft/s. 2. Ay = 40 g, V &lt; 47 ft/s. 3. Ay = 60 g, V &lt; 58 ft/s. A finite onset rate preceding the constant vehicle accelera- tion increases the velocity range in which no benefit is avail- able. Increasing car crush acceleration- higher vehicle stiff- ness-also increases the velocity range in which no ride-down is available.</page><page sequence="6">3214 F. A.

The vehicle interior- that is, the steering assembly- is stationary or rebounding, and the occupant impacts the assembly with at least the initial velocity of the vehicle. All the occupant energy must be dissipated by the interior of the vehicle (principally the steering assembly) and/or the occupant in the absence of a restraint system. Data noted below indicate that the combination of knee energy absorbers and current conventional energy-absorbing columns is sufficient (in the sense of a Gadd SI less than 1000) for the purpose at velocities less than 25 or 30 mph. A graph presented in Ref. 2 is shown as Fig. 9. The original graphic presentation showed only the driver air bag data, and the data on the unrestrained anthropomorphic devices (solid symbols) appeared in a tabulation- data points 47, 48, 49, 63, and 68 in Table 5 of Ref. 2. Sis ļ a d^ , based upon the resultant acceleration a, less than 1000 are indicated for the simulated drivers for speeds below about 30 mph. Three inches was the maximum column collapse observed for the tests conducted with unrestrained simulated drivers. However, it is reported in Ref. 2 that special pains were taken to reduce column frictional effects, and the data sho'|ji were obtained at zero offset and zero angularity. Further, a substantial part of the total load was taken out through the knees into an energy- absorbing dash panel, and some ride-down probably was ex- perienced because of the relatively large equivalent crush. Nevertheless, the fact that less than half the column stroke was used indicates that the current ball type of column- plus knee absorbers- has the energy capacity to be effective at speeds approaching 44 ft/s.

DRIVER RESTRAINT SYSTEMS HIGH-SPEED IMPACT - The ride-down threshold velocity analysis discussed in the previous section produces an interest- ing result for all velocities above that threshold value- occu- pant velocity relative to the structure is constant at the time of contact and is equal to the threshold velocity (9). The velocity* is vc = V2ā^F (1) *Recall that in the simplified analysis, it has been assumed that the structural deceleration is constant.</page><page sequence="8">3216 F. A. DuWALDT where: Vc = relative velocity between unrestrained occupant and vehicle structure ay = vehicle deceleration level (constant) b = initial separation distance between occupant and structure The energy, per unit occupant mass, corresponding to the above velocity differential increases with initial crash velocity Vo E~V0v^bi; (2) Use of a restraint having a force level that adapts to impacting mass and velocity is desirable, as has been noted in the litera- ture; Eq. 2 implies that the energy corresponding to occupant initial contact velocity is a linear function of impact velocity. At this point, it is necessary to note that the two major load application points on the driver are the chest and the knees. Current practice is to limit femur loads and chest accelerations. It is presumed that energy-absorbing knee bars* will operate near the permissible femur load limit, and, hence, attention will be devoted to forces applied to the torso for the purpose of decelerating the torso mass. The force characteristics of the device postulated for torso arrest are assigned to be -£- = A+BV+-|- c (3) mVc c mVc where : F = force decelerating torso, lb m = torso mass, slugs A, B, S = characteristic coefficients of device For the particular device described in the Appendix (for the first 5 in of travel) and with Vc measured in ft/s, A « 10 B « 2/3 S « 1001b and the spring force S is negligibly small for the problem being considered here. Hence, for Vc = 44 ft/s, a deceleration of about 55 g would be obtained, and at Vc = 33 ft/s, a decelera- tion of 44 g would be obtained. (For the idealized conditions depicted in Fig. 8, these contact velocities would correspond to driver separation distances of 8-1/2 and 5-1/2 in, respec- *Knee bars are in a reasonably advanced state of laboratory development for rear seat occupants (10) and have been adapted to the driver positions (1 1). tively, in a vehicle having a 40 g constant deceleration. The second separation distance corresponds to an "intrusion" of 3 in in the sense of the intruder/absorber briefly described in the Appendix.) The above discussion has been referenced to idealized vehicle pulses. Applications to the energy management structures de- scribed earlier can be made using graphic constructions similar to those employed in Ref. 9. Fig. 10 shows the construction superimposed on the time histories in Fig. 5. The driver has an initial displacement of -8-1/2 in from the steering assembly hub. His velocity of 58 mph remains unchanged until his dis- placement coordinate equals the displacement coordinate of the vehicle and this occurs at t « 42 ms after impact for the OV-II R. At t « 42 ms, the compartment velocity is seen to be about 28 mph. Hence, the velocity differential is (VQ - Vc) « 30 mph, and the energy absorber will apply a constant de- celeration of 55 g to the occupant torso. Torso velocity de- creases linearly from t ^ 42 ms until the value zero is reached at t « 92 ms. Total travel at 55 g would be about 26 in, of which approximately 5 in would be ride-down. Therefore, an absorber stroke of 21 in is indicated. This is the upper limit that can be expected in current compartments even with modi- fication of the instrument panel. Note that the rebound of the structure will impose further loads on the occupant. If the energy-absorbing unit is made to intrude 3 in (see the Appendix), the initial separation would be reduced to 5-1/2 in. Contact with the hub would now occur at about 36 ms when the structural velocity is about 35 mph. An applied force corresponding to 34 g would be developed due to the 21 mph velocity differential. Torso velocity would reach zero at t « 1 13 ms after a travel of 39 in, of which about 31 in would be stroke and 8 in ride-down. Current compartments would not permit the required stroke dimension. The above example of the OV-II R is disturbing. Reducing the relative velocity between the occupant and the structure is advantageous when the energy absorber operates at a fixed force level, but this is apparently not true at 60 mph for the velocity-sensitive device being modeled here. Similar operation on the Fig. 6 data obtained on the OV-II at 40 mph gives, for 8-1/2 in separation, contact after 52 ms and a 41 g deceleration for a stroke of about 15 in (Fig. 1 1). It is estimated that very little ride-down would be obtained, but the 1 5 in stroke could be obtained in current compart- ments. Operation of the intruder to reduce the separation by 3 in would lead to a decelerating force of 27 g and a required stroke of about 25 in if the structural ride-down distance is considered to be canceled the rebound. Again, the reduced separation distance leads to a greater stroke requirement at a reduced force level for the particular values assigned to the device characteristics. The above examples illustrating a particular velocity -sensitive device show that the distribution between velocity and veloc- ity squared (and constant) characteristics of the absorber re- quires further study. Harnesses and belts made with webbing having small elonga- tion would show similar behavior if similar absorbers were</page><page sequence="9">MATCHED DRIVER RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 3217 Fig. 10 - Calculated driver torso velocity in OV-IIR 58 mph pole impact for two driver separation distances with velocity-sensitive restraint Fig. 1 1 - Calculated driver torso velocity in OV-II 40 mph pole im pact for two driver separation distances with velocity-sensitive restraints mounted, for example, at the anchor points. Belt slack plays the part of separation distance between torso and steering hub. Similarly, an inertia reel plays the part of the intruder action in determining at what time after initial impact forces are ap- plied to the occupant. DRIVER RESTRAINT SYSTEM Many auxiliary conditions that must be satisfied by a driver restraint system have not been treated here. Background on these is contained, for example, in Ref. 1 1 , and only a sum- mary of a possible combination of elements is given below. Emphasis is required on means of avoiding defeat of the driver restraint system by peripheral effects. The following items are particularly noted, regardless of vehicle structural characteristics: 1 . Disengagement of the steering gearbox, to avoid intrusion and/or rotation of steering assembly. 2. Seat and seatback structural integrity.</page><page sequence="10">3218 F. A.

Maintenance of relatively small column longitudinal angle. Three aspects of driver restraint can be identified: 1 . Positioning, obliquity compensation. 2. Energy absorption. 3.

Four-bar linkage. The only item in the assemblage above that requires a word of explanation as to function is the four-bar linkage. It is the hanger on which the column is mounted, and its purpose is to allow lateral motion of the steering wheel (and energy absorp- tion in the lateral motion). An analysis of such a device is given in Appendix A of Ref. 1 1 . SUMMARY An investigation of a driver restraint device intended to adapt to a range of occupant masses and impact conditions was made. Demonstration calculations were performed on the basis of an energy management vehicle pulse, since such a vehicle provides occupant compartment integrity up to impact speeds of about 60 mph. For these existing device and vehicle characteristics, the following observations can be made: 1 . Stroke requirements at 60 mph are barely within the pos- sible range for current compartment dimensions. 2. Stroke requirements at 40 mph are within the possible range for current compartment dimensions. 3. Little structural ride-down advantage is indicated. 4. Reduction of separation of driver and structure (steering wheel hub) was not advantageous for the particular device characteristics studied. 5. The results suggest that introduction of a fixed-force component in the absorber and adjustment of velocity and velocity -squared characteristics could produce a fiighly de- sirable restraint performance. It is probable that a belt system with nearly identical energy- absorbing characteristics- that is, velocity and velocity -squared dependence- can be developed by introducing energy-absorb- ing devices at the anchor points. Provision of adaptive force characteristics in the driver re- straint system is important to the accommodation of the ex- pected range of driver masses. Auxiliary requirements im- posed by oblique impacts and uncontrolled intrusion, however, must also be satisfied. Overriding all restraint conditions is the necessity for compartment integrity. Valid experimental data on crashworthy vehicle pulses are available. Laboratory measurements demonstrate, at least crudely, the feasibility of velocity and velocity-squared re- straint characteristics. Determination of the "best" matching refinement of properties on the basis of more complete simu- lations and tests for validity is yet to be accomplished. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Dr. Patrick Miller raised the questions that led to this work and provided much of the direction. In addition, the descrip- tion of the energy management structures is his.

APPENDIX INTRUDER/ABSORBER DEVICE Introduction of an air cushion passive restraint system for the driver decreases occupant separation from the "structure" and, hence, offers some ride-down advantages in addition to its load distribution and damping gains. A balance between cushion size and actuation time must be made, however, and current airbags exhibit a relatively slow buildup of forces and, hence, poor stroke efficiency. The intrude r/absorber is in- tended to assist the airbag by furnishing an improved stroke efficiency and an incremental force level that may be required at high speeds. The device is a cylindrical hydraulic strut. The moving part is deployed by the burning of an 8 grain squib very much like an air cushion squib. Activation would be initiated by a crash sensor in the same way an air cushion is activated. It is hy- pothesized that the device would be used in conjunction with a toroidal air cushion- the cushion providing load distribution on the driver thorax and head and the intruder applying loads to the chest. The déployable part of the intruder weighs about 1/2 lb and Fig. A-l A - Disassembled intruder/absorber Fig. A-1B - Disassembled intruder/absorber Fig. A-l C - Extended intruder/absorber Fig. A-l D - Retracted intruder/absorber</page><page sequence="12">3220 F.

The scatter of deployment times with squib size can prob- ably be reduced by requiring closer tolerances on performance or by using two squibs with a total charge of about 10 grains.
