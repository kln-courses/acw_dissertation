<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Structure of Science: Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explana- tion. By ERNEST NAGEL. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London, 1961. 50s. Pp. 618 + xiii. THE theoretical character of modern science has been a considerable embarrassment to positivist philosophies of science. Various pro- grammes of reduction of theoretical concepts to observational terms consistently failed either to provide a plausible account of the nature of theories, or to provide detailed reduction definitions for any of the important theoretical concepts actually in use in science. But since it was unrealistic to suppose that science would abandon theory, the question arose whether science as universally practised could be accommodated within empiricism as traditionally understood.</page><page sequence="2">430 CRITICAL NOTICES: Professor Nagel has written an account of the structure of science which is the most detailed, the most cogent, and perhaps the last, defence of the view that the commonplaces of empirical philosophy since Locke and Hume remain basically unchallenged and unchalleng- able by the subsequent growth of science. I say perhaps the last, partly because it is not only philosophers of science who now chal- lenge these commonplaces, but also because to exhibit the whole massive argument, as Nagel here does so brilliantly, is itself to prompt the reflection that it is perhaps time Ptolemy met his Copernicus. The epicycic adjustments have become too top-heavy for comfort. The subject-matter of science may have increased immensely in complexity, but it is not obvious that the analysis of the structure of science needs to be as complex as the positivist starting-point makes it. These reflections are suggested mainly by chapters 5 and 6, the heart of Nagel's book, where he sets himself to show that the received distinction between experimental laws and theories is a real and important one; to delineate the major components of theories and the relations between them; to discuss the question whether theories state anything, whether they can be said to be 'true' or 'false'; and whether they refer to 'real entities'. His tools of analysis are the distinction between the logical and the empirical, the account of empirical meaning and truth in terms of ' observation of facts', and the consequent account of theories as ' indirectly verified', and theoretical terms as ' implicitly defined', by the deductive connection of theoretical and observation state- ments. Although I find myself in disagreement with Nagel on many of these points, it must be said at once that there are many puzzles in the detailed analysis of the sciences which yield to these tactics cleanly and without fuss. Nagel's brilliant unravelling of the various controversies about the status of force in mechanics, about the relation of geometry to the world, about the nature of the deter- minism implied by science, about teleological explanation and the nature of organization in biology, and many others, are all examples of the success of the traditional framework. No Copernican revolu- tion in the principles of the philosophy of science can be successful unless it leaves most of these analyses intact. As in science itself, however, relatively acceptable solutions can often be found to contain problems, while the foundations remain matters of intense contro- versy. Where such comparatively non-controversial solutions can be found, Nagel has stated them here, and for this reason alone his book will remain a classic and a standard text as long as current science survives. This work has indeed been done so thoroughly that to attempt to summarize would be an impertinence. I shall therefore concentrate this review on a few detailed points which seem to me to underly the whole structure of the argument, and which are of greatest and most controversial philosophical interest. The rest of the review may appear unduly critical, but this must be taken</page><page sequence="3">M. HESSE: The Structure of Science 431 as a measure of the importance of these particular issues rather than as an overall reaction to the book. I shall hang my remarks around Nagel's account of the tripartite structure of theories, which he outlines as follows: ' (1) an abstract calculus that is the logical skeleton of the explanatory system, and that " implicitly defines " the basic notions of the system; (2) a set of rules that in effect assign an empirical content to the ab- stract calculus by relating it to the concrete materials of observation and experiment; and (3) an interpretation or model for the abstract calculus, which supplies some flesh for the skeletal structure in terms of more or less familiar conceptual or visualizable materials' (p. 90). I shall discuss four points arising from this: 1. The problem of the 'meaning of theoretical terms', and in particular Nagel's notion of their 'implicit definition'. 2. The status of 'interpretations ' of the calculus, and the nature of ' models' of the theory. 3. The status of the 'correspondence rules' which are supposed to relate theory and experiment. 4. The assumption of a logical or structural distinction between theory and observation which underlies the whole account. 1. The Meaning of Theoretical Terms Nagel describes the notion of implicit definition of the terms of an abstract calculus by example. Consider the postulate system of Eucidean geometry. The postulates contain terms like ' point', ' line ', ' congruent with', and so on, but although these terms are drawn from the ordinary language of spatial experience, their meaning in the Euclidean calculus is not defined by this: 'to the questions " What is a point? " and " What is a line? " . . the only answer that can be supplied within a postulational treatment of geometry is that points and lines are any things that satisfy the conditions stated in the postulates. It is in this sense that the words "point " and "line " are implicitly defined by the postulates' (p. 92). Similarly 'molecule ' and ' kinetic energy ' within the kinetic theory of gases are not to be understood in terms of imagin- able particle-models or anything of the kind, but solely as that which satisfies the formal conditions of the postulates of the theory. This account or something like it is by now very familiar in logical analyses of science. It is not, however, free from ambiguities and obscurities. To start with, it is not clear whether terms such as ' point-' and ' line ', or their symbolizations in the calculus, are to be regarded as uninterpreted signs, as mere counters in the deductive game, or whether, as is suggested by Nagel's ' points and lines are any things that satisfy the conditions' (my italics), they are entities constituting any one of the possible models of the calculus. If the former, the postulates of the theory appear to assert nothing, in which case there arises a problem about whether theories can be true</page><page sequence="4">432 CRITICAL NOTICES: or false, or whether they are merely ' instrumental'. If the latter, the question arises: what is the class of all possible models which satisfy the postulates? It is absurd to suppose that all these models are known, and sometimes none are known. How in any case does the class provide a 'meaning' for the theoretical terms? In spite of some terminology which suggests this second alterna- tive account of meaning, Nagel's arguments seem to presuppose the first. This is especially clear in his discussion of the instrumentalist- realist controversy, and of the question of ' reality ' of theoretical entities, for it is not obvious that these problems arise in quite so intractable a form if the second account of meaning is given. But I shall confine myself to pointing out a more serious gap in Nagel's analysis which is consequent upon his adoption of the first account. This is that he completely fails to do justice to what is sometimes called the ' surplus meaning' of theories. Although he acknow- ledges Campbell as his mentor in the chapter on ' Experimental Laws and Theories', he does not notice that the tripartite division of theories which Campbell first outlined was intended by its author precisely to refute, by a reductio ad absurdum, the 'implicit defini- tion in a calculus ' account of meaning. Campbell repeatedly insists that a theory regarded as an abstract calculus without inter- pretation is nothing more than an arbitrary device, unintelligible and incapable of fruitful use. Nagel does indeed recognize, in the third characteristic of theories listed above, that interpretations, or models, of a theory have an important heuristic role, but he does not appear to think that they are relevant to the meaning of the theory. Before pursuing this, let us examine what he has to say about models. 2. Interpretations of the Calculus Following Campbell, Nagel points out the heuristic benefits of interpreting a theory (= calculus) in terms of some relatively familiar ' model', for example, the randomly moving billiard-ball model for the kinetic theory of gases. Such a model adds 'surplus meaning' to the theory in virtue of what is known about it independently of the fact that it satisfies the postulates of the calculus. This surplus meaning may then be useful in suggesting extensions of the theory, and in showing how the theory may be related to new experimental observations. But now the ambiguity noted above about the 'meaning' of the theory arises again. In speaking of analogies between, for example, gas molecules and billiard balls, do we not assume that' gas molecule' is already an interpretation of the calculus? We do not speak of an analogy between the symbol P, say, for a ' point' in geometry, and its interpretation as the intersection of two lines drawn on a piece of paper. No doubt Nagel's terminology is careless here, and could be corrected by speaking always of ' the billiard-ball model of the (uninterpreted?) calculus of the kinetic theory of gases, which</page><page sequence="5">M. HESSE: The Structure of Science 433 contains, among others, the uninterpreted sign " molecule"'. But in that case it becomes difficult to understand how the surplus mean- ing supplied by the model is related to the theory. There are, pre- sumably, an indefinite number of conceivable, if not existing, partially non-isomorphic models of the kinetic theory of gases. Does the billiard-ball model on whose surplus meaning physicists have often relied have a privileged status among these, and if so, why? If not, am I equally entitled to rely on predictions given by the surplus meaning of any of the other models? But, if entitled to rely on any, I cannot be equally entitled to rely on all, because some may contradict each other. Is the choice of model then quite arbitrary? Have no predictions based on any model any claim to be relied upon? Such a conclusion would be in conflict with the universally accepted practice of science in using theories in novel situations not covered by any previous abstract statement of the theory, and in making predictions with greater confidence from the surplus meanings of some models than of others. It would for example be absurd to claim that a prediction about the molecular structure of chromosomes, described in Nagel's example on page 96, is not more reliable when based on a model of chemical particles than when based on, say, a game of dice, although the calculi of both contain the probability axioms, while differing in other respects. At this point Nagel might reply that the game of dice would not do, because no deductions can be drawn from it about the relevant data, in this case inheritance characteristics. But this reply will not do either, because it is admitted that the abstract calculi of both the chemical particle-model and the dice-model require interpretation by means of correspondence rules in order to yield the experimental data. I shall look at Nagel's account of correspondence rules in a moment, but it is sufficient to say now that he nowhere suggests that these rules need to be controlled by any particular model or class of models. As long as they provide interpretations consistent with both theory and observation, they can on Nagel's view be entirely arbitrary. No doubt there is some rule of interpretation of the ' surplus' part of the calculus of a dice-model which will yield pre- dictions about inheritance, but in practice the chemical particle- model will always be preferred, and this preference is unintelligible if theoretical terms are merely counters in the calculus-game. In all predictive uses of a theory there is, as well as the calculus, also at least one 'privileged' model which determines the rules of interpre- tation for the theory in novel situations, and reference has to be made to this known model in order to understand the 'meaning' of the theoretical terms.1 1 There is an account of models for the empirical sciences in terms of both limitations and extensions of the semantic concept of model in a paper by Leo Apostel in The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences, ed. H. Freudenthal, Dordrecht, 1961, p. 1. The paper by Patrick Suppes in the same volume is also relevant to this</page><page sequence="6">434 CRITICAL NOTICES: This is not to say, of course, that all the entities constituting models in the privileged class have got to be known already to exist. The task of developing a theory is precisely that of determining which of them may be said without contradiction to 'exist' in the sense of being consistent with the experimental data. It follows that pre- dictions based on the privileged models have no guarantee of success. But it also follows that failures are not properly dealt with by merely replacing one arbitrarily chosen model by another equally arbitrary. It is rather a question of regarding the theory (calculus plus privileged model) as having been refuted, and of looking for another calculus-plus-model. How the class of privileged models is chosen in a non-arbitrary way in the first place is a question too long to go into here, but the criteria for these models will clearly be con- nected with how closely 'similar' or 'analogous' the relevant features of the model appear to be to the actual systems (for example, the gas-molecule model has a close analogy with actual billiard balls which are known to satisfy some of the same laws), and also with what is believed to be the fundamental character of the phenomena to be explained (for example, in explaining the data of physics, mechanical models will usually be preferred to anthropomorphic ones). It would of course be possible in principle to formalize the rules determining interpretation into the privileged class of models, as semantic rules for the calculus.1 That this formalization is rarely carried out in practice is irrelevant, but it is not irrelevant to point out that most accounts of the calculus-model structure of theories fail to notice that such rules are at least as important to the analysis of theoretical terms as the other components of theoretical structure which they recognize. Nagel does indeed show a partial recognition of this (for example at the outset of his discussion of the role of models on p. 106), but he still insists (p. 116) that it ' can be affirmed with confidence . . . that a model for a theory is not the theory itself'. The consequences of this impoverishment of the normal scientific sense of the ' theory' are not always trivial or merely verbal. Nagel, for example, in his otherwise admirably full and clear account of the structure of quan- tum theory, is misled into underestimating the importance still to be attached to ' partial interpretations ' of the theory in the farmiliar particle and wave models. Since these are admittedly only partial models for quantum theory, and are in places mutually contradic- tory, and since there is a consistent and reasonably satisfactory calculus ' implicitly defining ' the theoretical terms of at least classical quantum mechanics, Nagel's account would lead one to suppose that the particle and wave models would be as dead as phlogiston or issue. I have discussed some of the conditions to be satisfied by a ' privi- leged ' class of models in Models and Analogies in Science, to be published 1963 in the Newman History and Philosophy of Science Series. 'As suggested by E. H. Hutten, The Language of Modern Physics, London, 1956, chap. ii.</page><page sequence="7">M. HESSE: The Structure of Science 435 caloric. But a glance at research literature shows that this is not the case. Some interpretation of the calculus is a necessity of theo- retical reasoning, and in this case, since no complete and consistent model is available, resort must be had to partial and contradictory models controlled by ad hoc rules of application. It will not do to dismiss these as in principle dispensable. If they were dispensable they would here of all places have been dispensed with long ago. 3. Correspondence Rules We now come to Nagel's account of the empirical interpretation of theories. His most detailed discussion occurs in an unexpected place, namely in connection with the problems arising from the reduction of one theory or system of laws to another. It is signifi- cant, as I shall argue later, that his account here does refer equally to the relation between two theories, and the relation between theory and ' observables ', that is to say, the pattern of theory interpreted by means of correspondence rules is not peculiar to the interpretation into so-called ' observation statements'. Nagel takes as his chief example the reduction of the classical theory of thermodynamics to statistical mechanics, which requires among other things the ' identi- fication ' in some sense of 'temperature' (T) with ' mean kinetic energy of molecules ' (MV2). An identification such as this serves two purposes. First, it provides a means of linking the kinetic theory with experimental data, since the ' mean kinetic energy of molecules ', whatever it may refer to, is certainly not measurable by the usual operations for measuring particle-velocities, and so the identification is a typical example of a correspondence rule providing empirical interpretation of the theory. Second, this example is also a typical case of reduction of a more limited and less fundamental theory (classical thermodynamics) to a more general and fundamental theory (statistical mechanics), in which certain of the terms of the first theory (for example temperature), do not occur in the second, but are replaced there by, generally, functions of terms of the second theory (in this case, mass and velocity). Nagel makes three suggestions about the nature of these identifica- tions (p. 354): (1) They are logical connections in virtue of the meanings of the terms in the two theories. (2) They are conventions or co-ordinating definitions laid down by fiat. (3) They are factual hypotheses. He proceeds to eliminate (1) by remarking that 'temperature ' in classical thermodynamics is clearly not synonymous with 'mean kinetic energy of molecules', nor can the meaning of' temperature' be extracted from that of ' mean kinetic energy'. The significance</page><page sequence="8">436 CRITICAL NOTICES: of this remark does not become apparent, however, unless it is related to Nagel's previous analysis of the ' meaning' of theoretical terms. Suppose, first, we take both thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to be theories, so that both terms of the identification are theoretical terms. Then the 'meaning' of each term is implicitly defined by the postulates of the theory in which it occurs. If these two theories are different, the meanings of the terms will be different. In this example it has been presupposed that thermodynamics has been reduced to statistical mechanics, and this must mean at least that its postulates are isomorphic with a sub-set of the postulates or theorems of statistical mechanics. Thus on this analysis the differ- ence of meaning arises from the fact that the calculus of thermo- dynamics is only part of that of statistical mechanics. If, on the other hand, we analyse the meaning of the terms by means of the classes of models which satisfy the postulates of the two theories respectively, there will be a difference of meaning if the class of models for statistical mechanics is not co-extensive with that for thermodynamics. This is certainly the case if the classes of models concerned are restricted to privileged models, as suggested above. For then the reduction amounts to the (non-logical) assertion that the privileged models of thermodynamics are to be identified with a sub-set only of those of statistical mechanics. There is another way of interpreting Nagel's conclusion that the co-ordinating rules are non-logical, namely by taking ' temperature' to be, not a theoretical term, but an ' observable': that which refers to sensations of heat and/or is measurable by a thermometer. In this interpretation the identification is clearly non-logical, for when we announce that the temperature at mid-summer is 70?F, it cannot be a necessary part of our meaning that the mean kinetic energy of molecules in the atmosphere is such-and-such, since, among other reasons, persons who correctly use expressions about tempera- ture have not always heard of mean kinetic energies. What then is the status of the identifications? Can they be regarded as co-ordinating definitions, laid down by fiat? Nagel thinks they sometimes may be, partly on the grounds that develop- ment of a theory sometimes leads to the redefinition of expressions previously used as observables. Thus, in the present case, the meaning of 'temperature' as identified in the kinetic theory of gases is certainly not co-extensive with our subjective sensations of temperature, and may even require in some circumstances the ' correction' of thermometers previously used in operational de- finitions of temperature. ' Temperature' is now being used as a synonym of ' mean kinetic energy of molecules ', and so has ' changed its meaning'. This can be expressed otherwise by saying that the class of privileged models of statistical mechanics includes some but not all of the situations previously denoted by predicating ' tempera- ture ' of certain observable entities. This makes it clear that there is an overlap of denotation, for if this were not the case, it would be</page><page sequence="9">M. HESSE: The Structure of Science 437 odd to use the word 'temperature' in connection with the kinetic theory at all. Thus the identification may be a conventional one at an advanced stage of theory, but it is not arbitrarily conventional. In general, however, Nagel concludes that statements of identifica- tion must be regarded as physical hypotheses, not in the sense of experimental laws, but as parts of the theory itself, to be justified by the coherence of the whole theory and its other identifications with a wide range of experimental data. In connection with his discussion of co-ordinating rules, Nagel has something to say about the confusions which arise from claims that, for example, a headache is an arrangement of particles in the cranium, or, on the other hand, that since water is obviously not just a certain combination of the chemical elements, hydrogen and oxygen, it is absurd to suppose that its properties can ever be deduced from theirs alone. He suggests that these locutions are misleading because the question whether one science is reducible to another is not ' settled by inspecting the " properties " or alleged " natures " of things ', but by ' investigating the logical consequences of certain explicitly formulated theortes ' (p. 364). He carries out such investigations to great effect in two illuminating chapters on the philosophy of biology. But whether he is correct in locating the source of the trouble in alleged ' natures ' is more dubious. Headaches, he seems to say, are not arrangements of brain particles because such particles are not accessible to direct inspection and hence have no ' natures' apart from what is stated in a theory about them, whereas head- aches are accessible to inspection, we are aware of their ' nature'. But the point can be made equally effectively without dubious appeals to ' natures', which elements, atoms, and so on, allegedly lack, while headaches, water, temperature-sensations, and so on, are fortunate enough to possess them. First, as we have just noted, the extension of ' headache' may not exactly correspond with the class of physiological models which are conveniently grouped as explanations of the symptom 'headache' in a particular theory, because this theory may have made it convenient to redefine the original phenomenal term 'headache'. Second, and more im- portant, these identifications are misleading because whatever sensa- tions are, they are not identical with that which they are sensations of. The prick is not the point of the pin, the red sensation is not the rose- petal, a felt headache is not an arrangement of particles, a sensation of heat is not a motion of molecules. Whatever puzzles may lurk in the proper analysis of sensations, these puzzles surely do not arise only in the case of so-called theoretical entities, but also in the case of observables-pins, roses, hot bricks, and so on. Nagel is therefore not at liberty to exploit the puzzles in order to prove that a theo- retical term is different in kind from an observable, nor to show that observables have internal' natures ' which are denied to the terms of a theory. 29</page><page sequence="10">438 CRITICAL NOTICES: 4. Experimental Law and Theory This brings us to the most controversial assumption underlying Nagel's arguments, which is undoubtedly his distinction between experimental law and theory. It is easy to see that the distinction arises inevitably from the pervasive empiricist assumption of a ' basic ' observation language, and the effects of this are also seen in the later chapters on the social sciences, where a parallel and equally dubious distinction is drawn between ' neutral facts ' and ' value- judgments'. Nagel's arguments in favour of the distinction can be considered under three heads. (1) According to Nagel, the terms of experimental laws are 'operationally definable', and laws are established by the direct evidence of their observable instances. Theoretical terms, on the other hand, are not explicitly definable by means of operations, and theories have no 'identifiable instances' and must therefore be established ' indirectly'. Nagel disarms the most obvious objections to this at the outset by conceding that the boundaries of ' observability ', and between ' direct' and ' indirect' evidence, are not sharp, and that it is un- profitable to try to define too closely the notion of ' observable'. Therefore it would presumably be missing the target to point out that many concepts usually called ' theoretical' satisfy his condi- tion for experimental terms (for example, the ' mass of the electron '), while many terms usually regarded as experimental are not explicitly definable by a finite number of observational procedures (e.g. ' gas '). But Nagel's assertion that theories have no ' identifiable instances ' cannot be allowed to pass without question. He is presumably not here merely making the debating point that the theory identified with a formal calculus states nothing and therefore a fortiori has no instances (this point can in any case be dealt with, as he remarks on page 141, by the Ramsey device of replacing the theoretical predicate- signs by variables, and existentially quantifying over them). The point here is rather what is crudely expressed by saying that we ' do not observe electrons directly but only indirectly by means of their effects'. A full analysis of this very curious expression would involve questioning the assumption that electrons are something other than the totality of their actual and potential effects as de- scribed in the quantum theory. (Is an explosion something other than the bang, the cloud of dust, the flying rocks?) Nagel himself has dealt cogently and sufficiently with this very assumption in his section on the alleged ' dual nature ' of quantum particles (pp. 298- 305). It would take too long to pursue this problem, but even if we grant that there is some sense in which ' electrons are not directly observed', it still seems odd to maintain that theories have no identifiable instances. What is an experiment with a Wilson cloud- chamber if not an identifiable instance of electrons as defined in quantum theory? If it is not, then how is it relevant to that theory,</page><page sequence="11">M. HESSE: The Structure of Science 439 aiid why should it sometimes be used to confirm or refute some aspects of that theory? A theory is of course a complex system of state- ments, most of which remain unaffected by the results of isolated experiments. But this provides slender grounds for the assertion that such experimental tests are not identifiable instances of the entities described in the theory. There is, incidentally, another oddity here. Experimental laws, says Nagel, are established directly by observable instances, and only considered to be established when such instances are available (p. 85). How then are they distinguished from statements of mere accidental universality? In his chapter devoted to this perennial problem, Nagel makes the entirely acceptable point (p. 64), that they are usually distinguished by the fact that they rest on indirect evidence, in the sense of being derivable from a system of laws or theory, as well as on the direct evidence of observation. It may even happen, he argues, that a law is not discarded in the face of apparently contradictory direct evidence if its indirect evidence is strong enough. It might be added that sometimes an experimental law is held to be established solely on the basis of such indirect evidence, but even if Nagel cannot accept this, he must agree that the relevance of indirect evidence to laws does at least undermine the conclusion that a difference in the nature of the evidence provides an important and radical distinction between theories and laws. (2) The second distinction between them is made to rest on their 'meaning'. Laws derive their meaning from the observable situa- tions they refer to, and this meaning is retained independently of whatever theory may currently explain the laws. The meaning of theories on the other hand is defined implicitly, and is only partially empirical in virtue of the connection between theory and law via the correspondence rules. But our previous account of ' meaning ' can be used to dissolve this distinction also. The ' meaning' of the terms of an experimental law can be said to be given by the class of observable situations which satisfy the law-they are some of its ' models'. The theory which explains this law is associated with a class of privileged models, each of which contains the observable situations which are models of the law. Thus the curious duality of meaning involved in Nagel's account of theoretical and experimental terms can be removed, and with it one more argument for the radical distinction between theory and law. An example will help to elucidate this. One of the most artificial consequences of Nagel's analysis is the need to distinguish between two versions of the same statement-systems in the case of ' abstrac- tive ' or ' phenomenological' theories. These are theories, such as elementary geometry or mechanics, in which there are no terms which are not experimental. But ' mass', ' acceleration', ' circle ', come, in Nagel's account, to have a dual nature: they are both operation- ally definable observables, and theoretical terms implicitly defined by the postulates of geometry and mechanics, and therefore the</page><page sequence="12">440 CRITICAL NOTICES: co-ordinating rules consist merely of one-to-one identifications of a theoretical term with an observable. All this apparatus is surely unnecessarily cumbersome. Of course there is a difference between the ' crude data ' of geometry and mechanics, and the smoothed-out idealized concepts of their theories, but it is not the crude data which are in question here. Whatever it is that is operationally definable and enters into observation statements, is already the result of a processing of data, if only because it has been put into words and because measurements can be carried out only with a certain degree of accuracy. And if the theory really explains these processed observations, then its consequences are just the observation state- ments. There is no point in speaking as though the theory is located in some ideal heaven, making contact with the world only via mys- terious one-to-one correspondence rules. A much more economical way of expressing the matter is to say that among the privileged models of an abstract geometry or mechanics are just those situations which are observed (described within certain limits of accuracy). Of course, as with all theories, the models may also include some terms which mere observation might not suggest, for example, ' instantane- ous acceleration' or the ' point at infinity', but it does not follow from this that the ' acceleration' of the theory is not the same as the ' acceleration' of the experimental law, always remembering that this is the acceleration as we chose to regard it for the purposes of both the experimental law and its explanatory theory. Nagel's assertion that experimental laws must have some meaning independent of the theory which is to explain them, and that there- fore laws can survive the demise of particular theories, can now be restated without his duality of meaning. In terms of classes of models it is simply the assertion that if a class of observable situa- tions satisfies an experimental law, then any theory which is to explain that law must contain those situations as part of each of its privileged models. This explains both why the observable situa- tions only partly define the experimental and theoretical terms (because these situations do not constitute the whole of any of the models of the theory), and also why the meaning of the experimental terms may change with change of theory (because the relatively 'non-observable ' parts of the models have changed).1 (3) Finally, theories are said to differ from experimental laws in being more general and covering a wide range of qualitatively different things. Here there is certainly a genuine difference, although it would seem a comparatively trivial one. Nagel tends to overestimate its importance by attempting to ' account for' the generality of theories (p. 81-but why does it need ' accounting 1 Cf. later in the book, 'although they continue to employ such terms as " sunrise " and " sunset ", they do not use them with the same meanings those terms had when the Ptolemaic theory was dominant' (p. 604), a con- clusion which is hardly intelligible on Nagel's own account of the relation between theory and observation.</page><page sequence="13">M. HESSE: The Structure of Science 441 for '?) by means of his other distinctions between theories and laws. But two different things seem to get confused here. If we mean by 'theory' merely an abstract calculus, for example the mathematical wave theory, then this certainly has generality in the sense that different identifications of its terms lead to different experimental situations as instances of a wave theory-for example systems of pendulums, or oscillatory electric circuits. But this is not the type of generality required, for the same might be said of a simple harmonic equation interpreted as an experimental law in all these situations. This is, however, the type of generality which leads to the view of theories as essentially different from laws because more ' abstract', ' not directly verifiable', and so on. But this is a quite harmless sort of abstractness-it is merely the abstractness of an uninterpreted calculus as opposed to the interpreted theory. The kind of substantial generality Nagel intends to refer to does not in fact support any of his other theory-law distinctions. This is the generality most spectacularly exemplified by the unification of optics and electromagnetism in the electromagnetic theory of light. Here there was not just a question of noting that the same calculus could be made to yield one set of experimental data or the other by suitable interpretations, but rather of the substantial discovery that one interpreted theory was identical with the other interpreted theory (that electromagnetic waves of a certain frequency were light waves). And in this sense greater generality goes neither with absence of identifiable instances nor with greater ' abstractness ' of meaning, and therefore it does nothing to support Nagel's dualistic thesis.
