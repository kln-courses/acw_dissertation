<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 INTRODUCTION This year's report is based on two issues of the Archaiologikon Deltion for 1985 and 1986. The first half of the Chronika for 1987 has reached us but not the second. The information for 1987 will therefore be incorporated next year. Once again I thank the Librarian of the BSA, Penny Wilson Zarganis, for the section on new publications; Yana Spence for translations from the German and David Turner for his specialist coverage of the Byzantine material. He prefaces his section: "For the Byzantine period and later, volumes 40 (1985) and 41 (1986) of the ADelt have been covered. The extent of work on Post-Byz material precludes even partial treatment here, but the most significant indications of Byz settlement (kastra etc.), demographic information (cemeteries etc.), church wall-painting and architecture, as well as LR and Byz sites that have been newly excavated or reported, have been included." Press coverage is from 1.6.92 to 31.5.93. The press coverage this year seems better grounded, perhaps due to better press releases from the archaeologists themselves, but readers must still treat these reports with caution. As I write, at the end of June 1993, the main issue which obscures all else is again theft, following the disappearance from the National Museum of the A Sphinx head from Aigina. The regulations about bags are being strictly enforced here and elsewhere and visitors should bear this in mind when preparing for a visit. This has unfortunately not been the only theft during the year; others have taken place in the Acropolis Museum, the Kanellopoulos Museum and in the provinces. The danger to small local museums was the subject of a thoughtful article by E. Penta- zos, Ephor at Delphi (Nea 9.10.92). The other current issue is the Greek attempt to stop the sale in New York of the Myc jewellery presumed to be illicitly excavated from Aidonia (Korinthia). It may be noted that this is the first time the Greek government has made such an attempt, which has the twofold purpose of regaining the objects and also publicizing the problems of illicit digging and the market in smuggled items. Matters of particular interest this year have included underwater archaeology, with three major feature articles as well as normal coverage, following perhaps on the spectacular finds from Alonessos. Macedonia has remained a front runner with the problems of the centre of Thessalonike taking first place, but with the origin of the Macedonian star a close second-a coin of Mende of 425BC, now apparently lost, is quoted as a very early example (Eleutheros Typos 27.1.93). The papers have taken up the issue of the upkeep of sites in general and 'horror' photos have become a regular feature. It is interesting too that a number of commercial firms have been using archaeology-based advertisements in both the local and international press. The Minister of Culture has put forward details of an ambitious scheme to make an archaeological park in the centre of Athens with a walkway extending from the Kerameikos to the Olympeion and the Stadium. Various technical matters are of interest: the Ministry of Culture is to move to a building behind the National Museum; the possible splitting of some large Ephorates (particularly in the Byz section) is under discussion; the difficulties to tourists from the abolition of a uniform for site and museum guards has been the subject of correspondence (those in the National Museum wear identity tags but this is not widespread); the implementation of EEC regulations for site/museum entry has caused confusion. At present all students at EEC universities are entitled to a free entry pass (not to free entry with their university or international student cards-they must go and have a free entry pass issued). Foreign issues that have caught the attention of the press and the archaeological world here include the Amarna papyrus with Myc implications in the British Museum, recent work on the Philistines, the excavations at Tell Kabri with the evidence for M relations if not craftsmen; and a telling report on the Greek antiquities of Skopje (Kathemerine 29.11.92). Periodicals covered are those received by the BSA between 1.6.92 and 31.5.93. They are: Archaiologia 40, 41 (1991), 42, 43, 44, 45 (1992), 46 (1993); Archaiologike Ephemeris 129 (1990); Archaiologiko Ergo ste Makedonia kai Thrake 4 (1990); Archaiologikon Deltion 40A, 40B (1985), 41B (1986); Archeion Euboikon Meleton 28 (1988-9) and Paratema (1991); Athens Annals of Archaeology 19 (1986), 20 (1987); Balkan Studies 31, 1 &amp; 2 (1990); Byzantiniaka 12 (1992); Dodone 19, 21, 24 ; Epeteris Etaireias Byzantinon Spoudon 47 (1987-9); Epeteris Etaireias Stereoelladikon Meleton 6 (1990); Ellenika 42,1 &amp; 2 (1991-2); Kerkyraika Chronika 28 (1986); Pelopon- nesiaka Paratema 17 (1990); Phthiotika Chronika 13 (1992); Praktika tes en Athenais Archaiologikes Etaireias 1989; Technologia 5-6 (1992); Thessaliko Emerologio 20 (1991); Tome 301 5 (1992); Trikalina 12 (1992). Of these several are of general interest. Archaiologia 45 deals with conservation while 46 covers the organization of archaeology in Greece as a whole and in some of the foreign countries which work in Greece. This periodical has also been running an interesting series on the museums of Greece, with photographs and plans; those covered in these issues are: Nemea, Dion, Euboea, White Tower, Agrinion and Delphi. Technologia 5-6 has several articles on heritage management as well as discussion articles on issues of both actual technol- ogy and folklore; various symposia are also reported, notably one on ship building and one on olive oil production. Tome 301 5, 52-66 publishes an account of the work of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. AAA appears to have changed its format and is now publishing short reports of relatively recent work. The 'Chronique des Fouilles et D6couvertes Arch6ologi- ques en Grece en 1991' has just appeared in BCH 116 (1992) 833-954 with an impressive selection of photographs of material published in ADelt 40 Chr. This 'Chronique' covers only that volume of the ADelt and the finds of 1991 but it forms as always a very useful control and index to the material in this and the previous AR. Museums and Collections: It was reported in error last year that the plan to move the Numismatic Museum to the Iliou Melathron had been overturned. I am glad to say that this is not so and that the Museum will move at any moment to its new setting. The antiquities collection of the Academy of Athens has been made available to scholars (Kathemerine 21.1.93). An interesting series of articles on the Museums of Greece has been published regularly in Nike. A delightful exhibit of the Kyrenia II (the full scale replica) has been arranged on the sea front at Raphina, with a small background exhibit, and will be open until May 15 1994. The Archaeologi- cal Society is cooperating in the production of a catalogue of the castles of Greece (Ergon 1992, 104). Nike 24.6.92 adds the Morisini lions in Venice to the list of antiquities it would like returned to Greece. Conferences have been so numerous this year that it would be invidious to list those that have come to my particular notice; both the younger foreign schools and local municipal- ities have been taking a lead in this field. The centenary celebrations at Delphi last September however were a unique</page><page sequence="2">4 E.B. FRENCH experience and stand by themselves as the high point of the year, though the heart-warming welcome and hommage to Nicholas Hammond at the meeting organized in his honour this May will remain in the memory of all who attended. The archaeometry section of Demokritos celebrated the anniversary of its foundation with a specialist meeting in March. The Greek Foundation has now become a reality and welcomed many leading scholars to an academic meeting earlier this month. Another new foundation of which one section covers 'Culture' is the Lambrakis Foundation, where the Prometheus programme (inter alia) will be used to make a database of the monuments of the Acropolis as the start of a wider scheme. Exhibitions: The most impressive major exhibition of the year has been that of the Mitsotakis collection of Minoan antiquities at the Goulandris Museum of Cycladic art (with excellent catalogue). Three exhibitions arranged between Greece and the United States have been organized in connec- tion with the celebrations of 2500 years of Democracy: the much publicized Greek Miracle, another actually on the workings of democracy organized in cooperation with the ASCS and displayed first at the Gennadius Library, and a technical exhibition on the architecture of the Parthenon which has been seen in Philadelphia. A prize was awarded by the Academy of Athens for the book by N. Ashton and E. Pantazoglou, Siphnos: Ancient Towers B.C. and the Voroi Ethnological Museum in Crete was one of the nominees for the Museum of the Year award (Nea 15.9.92).

(ADelt 40 Chr, 6-8) In 1985 the 3rd Ephorate concentrated largely on the large expanse of Plateia Kotzia (now Ethnikis Anastaseos) which lies just outside the Acharnai gate and which will be separately published. Important information was also recovered confirm- ing previous assumptions about the plan of the town and about the cemeteries to the NW. A useful plan of the areas under report is provided. (ADelt 40 Chr, 13-34) No report is published for 1986. Acropolis. A test was made in a gap in the floor of the N wing of the Parthenon between the 7th and 8th columns from the E to see if its function could be determined. It contained bones and pottery as well as a fragment of one of the columns and thus appears to have been used as an ossuary in its last phase. Excavation stopped at a lower layer of well-worked blocks. The original purpose was not immediately comprehen- sible. (ADelt 40 Chr, 9) In December 1992 the last of the original blocks of the frieze in situ were taken down and placed in the Museum, an event of which there was wide press coverage. This and other work under the aegis of the Committee for the Conservation of the Monuments of the Acropolis is contained in a report by Professor Bouras which was presented to the public in March, the text of which he has kindly sent me. The 5th column of the S facade was lifted to one side, the damaged lower drum repaired and the column replaced. The walls of the cella have been dismantled so that the iron repairs can be removed and the many additional fragments identified and put in their proper places. The fragments are being organized using special computer software called Iktinos. Other projects, such as the Pronaos of the Parthenon and the Propylaia proceed more slowly, needing repeated detailed consultation and consider- ation. Surface conservation and work on the archive (and other recording) continues steadily. The Committee plan to organize an exhibition of the work which can travel abroad. Agora. Professor T. Leslie Shear Jnr (ASCS) reports: "In 1992 the areas under investigation during the season were two in number: on the S side of Hastings Street beneath the modem property 1370/8, and along the N side of Hadrian Street beneath properties 1370/7 and 1370/27. In terms of the ancient topography the latter area lay at the NW corer of the agora, whereas the former area lay N of the market square along the street leading NW out of the agora. At the N end of the section, exploration of the highest preserved Byz levels brought to light a complex of two rooms bounded on the NE and NW by gravelled streets. A large rectangular room opened on to a courtyard toward the SW by way of two wide open- ings, which were probably covered by arches. The courtyard was provided with two successive floors cobbled with smooth river pebbles, of which the higher corresponded with the terracotta lid of a large storage jar set below the floor at the S edge of the court. The adjacent room was evidently a store- room, for it was completely filled below floor level with three enormous pithoi, very substantially built of thick, hard lime mortar. The room is possibly to be understood as the storage space on the ground floor of a two-storey house, and living rooms on the floor above the storeroom might have been approached by a light wooden stairway rising from the neighbouring courtyard. As elsewhere among the MByz structures of this area, the stratigraphy suggested at least two phases in the use of the building. A group of pottery found in the central pithos of the storeroom shows that it was abandoned late in the 13th Ct AD, whereas the pithos next to it on the NW had gone out of use by the E 12th Ct. The third pithos, further to the S, produced the unusual number of 17 coins, of which preliminary analysis suggests that many date to the reign of Manuel I (1143-1180), thus the pithos will have been filled in by the late 12th Ct. At the edge of the street along the NE wall of the building, there came to light a well that provided water for the neigh- bourhood during two separate periods of use. The tile-lined well of the R period was first used in the 3rd Ct AD, and its original well-head of Hymettian marble was found in place. The shaft was partially cleaned out for reuse by Byz times, when its collar of rubble masonry was raised by 90cm. The original marble puteal was found reused upside down at the top of the collar. The total depth of the well was 14.10m below the lip of the well-head, but only the lowest 85cm of the shaft yielded undisturbed fill from the R period of use. This con- sisted of numerous micaceous water jars, mugs, two lamps, seven bone dice, a bronze jug, an iron knife with a wooden handle carved in the form of an eagle's head, and 24 coins. From the very bottom of the well came also the single most notable find of the season, the small marble head of a herm preserved in pristine condition, and carved in the unmistakable style of the EC period. Higher in the well-shaft, and separated from the R filling by a layer of mud, was the fill of the Byz period of use. This was 6m deep and was almost solidly packed with literally dozens of coarse-ware jars of various shapes, many of which emerged intact from the watery mud. The fill was so deep and the jars so numerous that it was possible to discern a clear development in their shapes from the lowest to the highest. Detailed analysis of the material should provide close dating for this sequence of development, because a group of 30 coins was found scattered at various levels through the period of use fill. Four of these coins, in excellent condition and readily identifiable, were in fact recovered in correct stratigraphic sequence. All proved to be folles of Anonymous Byz type, of which the lowest was datable to the period 976-1030, and the highest belongs to the period 1042-1055. By far the greatest part of the fill from the Byz period of use seems to have accumulated in the shaft during the last quarter of the 10th Ct and the first half of the 11th Ct. The highest 4m of the well-shaft contained debris that appeared to have been deliberately dumped in to close the well. Quantities of broken tiles and stones suggested the destruction of nearby buildings, and the pottery was broken into small fragments as is characteristic of dumped fills. Large amounts of green and brown painted ware and of fine sgraffito show that the well was closed and abandoned in the first half of the 12th Ct. Further to the SE along the street which at all times defined the topography of this area was a small two-room structure of MByz date, whose builders made use of pre-existing walls built in the rubble and concrete fabric of late antiquity. The plan consists of two adjacent rooms of equal width (3.30m), of which the E was deeper than the W although not so well preserved. A tile pavement was partly preserved in the W room, and beneath this floor the discovery of three tile-lined burial cists indicated the identity of the building as a small chapel, of which the W room was the narthex. Two of the cists were cut through the tile floor of the narthex and contained a variety of human bones representing several individuals, including children. The third cist, considerably deeper than the others, contained a single extended burial placed with the head toward the W. The E room of the chapel also contained a burial cist that had been greatly disturbed in later times. Traces</page><page sequence="4">6 E.B. FRENCH of plaster on the rubble face of the foundation separating the narthex from the E room give evidence of a vaulted cist 1.15m wide and 1.15m deep, but only the burials on the floor of the cist chanced to survive at all. Here was found a mass of human bones much broken and disturbed, and preserved in very brittle and friable condition. The E end of the chapel was terribly mutilated by late disturbances, but it was possible to recognize a small segment of foundation for a single polygonal apse which would have formed the E termination of the little building. In the extreme SE corer of the excavated area, the season's work began with further investigation of the church of Agios Nikolaos, prior to removal of its badly preserved foundations. It is now plain that the church had a long life beset by many vicissitudes. Although several phases in its history can now be distinguished, the architectural remains are so exiguous that a detailed reconstruction of the building in any period must remain highly conjectural. The original construction of the church seems to have been MByz, but the only remains of this period are the foundations for a central polygonal apse and for a W narthex. The N side has been completely obliterated by later digging in the Eridanos Channel, and the S side must lie beneath Hadrian Street. In its original form the church was built on a site previously occupied by domestic architecture of 9th and 10th Cts of which several walls and at least one pithos were found under the remains of the church. The earliest burial at the W end of the building was a single tile-lined cist, dug in 1991, and the green and brown painted and sgraffito sherds found here provide a terminus ante quem in the first half of the 12th Ct for the first period of the church. Since the burial lay directly beneath the W wall of the narthex, that structure must necessarily have been an addition to the original church. It is to be noted that the six burial cists in the W half of the nave, as well as its N foundation uncovered in 1990 and 1991, all share an orientation a few degrees N of E, whereas the earliest foundations were oriented exactly with the compass points. These remains should belong to a third phase and major rebuilding of the church. The new orientation had been adopted, and at least one of the burial cists, the E cist, produced two fragmentary bowls of that date, which were apparently used to bur incense at the time of interment. The great double channel of the Eridanos River was the third principal focus of the season's field work. The N channel of the masonry canal, barely tested in 1991, was explored for a length of about 6m where its cover slabs had not been pre- served, at the point where the river passes under the scarp of Hadrian St. The N wall of the channel proved to be of even finer construction than the S and median walls that were partly exposed last year. It consisted of ashlar blocks of poros laid in four regular courses with carefully spaced joints. The lowest course projected 12cm forward from the face of the wall and rested on poros pavement slabs laid with equal care, and clearly of uniform construction with the N wall. In the limited area opened this season, this original pavement was found to be everywhere intact, and it formed an overall depth of the N channel of 2.08m. At both ends of the excavated part of the channel, poros floor slabs forming a later secondary floor were preserved at a level 44cm higher than the original pavement. A layer of silt and gravel, which had gathered between the two sets of pavement slabs, produced pottery of the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC, by which date the raised floor of the channel should have been installed. Further cleaning of the walls and floor of the S channel helped to corroborate the evidence of the N. It is now clear that the ashlar masonry of the S and median walls is not so carefully constructed as that of the N wall. Although the poros floor slabs of the S channel were thought last year to have been completely eroded away by the running water, sections of its pavement have now been uncovered in a few places, while in the rest of the channel the natural bedrock of the river bed has been exposed. In the S channel, however, the poros pavement was found to lie 28cm higher that than the raised secondary floor of the N channel, which in turn was exactly level with the natural bedrock to the S. These circum- stances suggest that what survives of the original canalization of the river are the N wall and the earlier, lower pavement adjacent to it. By the late 5th Ct BC, the river channel was greatly increased, perhaps nearly doubled, in width. The median wall was inserted to reduce the huge span required of the cover slabs, and the floor levels of the two channels, thus formed, were brought into closer conformity. The disturbed cover slabs were also removed from the E exposed portion of the S channel, and this shed light on an interesting episode in the history of the Eridanos. The early German archaeologist Ludwig Ross explored the S channel of the river in 1832 and has left a vivid account of his adventure. Having descended 7m in a manhole near the Metropolis, Ross traversed the canal beneath Pandrosos and Hephaistos Streets until he was forced by a collapse to surface near St. Philip's Church. Another manhole further W in the vicinity of the 'Theseion Gardens' enabled him to reach the river again and thence to move E. At a point which he specified as under the first houses W of St. Philip's, Ross described seeing a row of some 20 poros column drums of Doric order set vertically in the N wall of the channel, about 1.50m apart. The excavations of this season exposed the first columns of this series: one drum, evidently dislodged by later digging in the 19th Ct, was removed from the channel; two others are visible exactly as Ross described them at the E end of the exposed channel; two more were seen and recorded in place by intrepid excavators who crawled like Ross beyond the limit of the excavations. The Doric drums are of appropriate stone, dimensions, and workmanship to have come from the Stoa Poikile, and they were undoubtedly lifted from the stylobate of the stoa, not 3m distant, and re-used in late antiquity to support the median wall of the Eridanos Canal. In addition to the archaeological interest of the Eridanos River, it is important to comment on its existence as a constantly flowing watercourse beneath the city of Athens. In order to carry out the exploration of the river channels just described, it was necessary to employ four electric pumps constantly. These removed 30 cubic metres of water per hour both day and night (720 m3 per day) throughout the excavation season, and for lack of a better expedient, the water was simply poured directly into the city sewer system. It had been our original intention to conduct these pumping operations only long enough to clear the S channel W by tunnelling under Hadrian Street. Our purpose had been to carry the water in pipes at the level of the anc. river bed as far as the W limit of the excavation, and thence to deliver it for use within the archaeological park. This plan proved impossible to carry out because the cover slabs of the S channel have completely collapsed for a distance of 8m beneath Hadrian Street. It is to be hoped that the portion of Hadrian Street passing through the archaeological area can be excavated during the next season." Library of Hadrian. Following conservation in 1985 (ADelt 40 Chr, 11) excavation was carried out in four areas in 1986 of which a detailed account is given; the most important results were the removal of Ott features on the W, revealing the R below, notably in the area of the Propylon. Some important evidence of the pre-Haseki fortifications came to</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 7 light from the period when this was the W gate of the town. From the latter buildings came many fragments of the R structure including a piece of one of the Cor capitals. Under the Ott bath were found two exedras and evidence for the LR fortification (built by Justinian) which allowed only one entry. A long base for the statuary known from an inscription and from Pausanias' description came to light. In the S peristyle work was carried out to show the bases of the second phase of the building. (ADelt 41 Chr, 10-11) A note on the R house is published in Archaiologia 40 (1991), 91. LR Wall. A further section of this monument was investi- gated in 1985 in the basement of Adrianou 98 (and nearby). It can be dated to the 3rd Ct AD and contains many spolia; it was shown to have been built partly on natural and partly on a stone levelling fill. At this point three courses are preserved, and a corner and small section of tower were noted, though obstructed by the modern basement walls. (ADelt 40 Chr, 6-7) Makrygianne: Weiler Building. During the repair of this building in 1986 the spolia incorporated in the walls were recorded and excavations were carried out in the basement and nearby. A detailed account is given of the work, of which the most notable result was the find of a N-S roadway (with associated drains) giving important evidence of the city's layout at this point. A drain of HL date was of interest for the use of amphoras to relieve the weight of fill above. Three LR/ECh mosaics and accompanying foundations also came to light; one area had later been used as a bath but the original function was not clear, whether private or public, perhaps a basilica. Outside the building, tests revealed the support wall for an E-W road and the base of a stele. It is suggested that the Shrine of Kodros may be situated here. (ADelt 41 Chr, 11-15) Othonian town. The mysterious underground passages that underlie parts of the centre of Athens are described and discussed in Kyriakatike 25-27.12.92. R Agora. In 1985 this area was tidied and some testing carried out prior to Athens becoming the Cultural Capital of Europe. (ADelt 40 Chr, 8-9) Theatre of Dionysus. Considerable cleaning and excavation took place in 1985 in the area N of the E parodos, of which a detailed account is given. Evidence of the supporting wall of the Lycurgan phase was found with G and bf sherds. The construction of the main supporting wall is of interest: the upper two courses are of stretchers, the lowest of headers. Some blocks are missing, possibly looted for later building. Other support walls with many spolia have not yet been dated. Construction methods similar to those used on the acropolis are noted. This area of Athens was heavily occupied in ECh and Byz times and there is evidence of a pottery kiln. Particularly important is the evidence retrieved for the Rizokastro which now appears to have been built in the 1st half of the 13th Ct by the Franks, following Byz construction of the 12th to 13th Cts, and not in the 11th Ct as Travlos suggested. It was destroyed in 1877 in order to retrieve the antiquities built into it. (ADelt 40 Chr, 9-10) Inside the walls. At Erectheiou 24-6 the history of the area was clearly revealed. The earliest remains were small Myc ChTs with one burial each and few offerings, which can be dated to LH IIIA. Other later tombs include a rich PG cist. Subsequently the area was used for houses not yet fully dated but probably of C to 1st Ct BC. Some 'sacrificial' pyres of the 4th Ct were recorded. Later the area seems to have been left open (until recent times) because of its nearness to the city wall, though four large HL channels were cleared. (ADelt 40 Chr, 13-4) At Chatzemichale 3 a LR complex was investigated, with considerable difficulty, in the basement of a modem house. A detailed account of the constructional features is given: one room was vaulted while a second had later been used as an ossuary. In the courtyard and a third room was a mosaic typical of the 5th Ct AD; this was lifted and removed to the Ephorate's store. (ADelt 40 Chr, 15-6) The long trenching of sewage work in six areas at the W of the city confirmed the heavy occupation here. The roadway noted at Erakleidon 18-42 (ADelt 40 Chr, 19-21) had been relaid seven times, and other finds included EC and LR workshops, an amphora with a scratched Latin inscription (HERPHAE), C and HL structures and an EA and C pottery deposit. Elsewhere were found the water supply for a HL workshop complex excavated in 1980 (AR 1988-89, 11), a R bath complex, a HL kiln et al. Much was heavily disturbed. (ADelt 40 Chr, 21-8) Of interest was the plot for the Primary School at Aktaiou- Eptachalkou-Ephestiou (ADelt 40 Chr, 25-7) where the city wall had been expected; clearance to natural revealed two G tombs, a HL well and cistern used as a deposit in the second half of the 2nd Ct BC (including an inscription: ---------] YP on one side, and on the better preserved: BETOYPI) and a 4th Ct AD R kiln. More recent work in the Plaka area in particular is summarized in Emeresia 6.6.92. The walls. Of particular note was the work at Erakleidon 54 and Erysichtous where part of the outworks of the W fortifications of the 4th Ct BC came to light, with a stretch of the anc. roadway with drainage, and for the first time evidence for the 4th Ct ditch. The results prove that there was no additional gate in this area. Evidence for the tower of the Justinianic period was also found. (ADelt 40 Chr, 18-19) Kathemerine 4.4.93 publishes an extensive illustrated article on the sections of the walls that are in existence and how they have been preserved. The Metro. The plan to equip Athens with two lines of underground railway in addition to the existing Piraeus- Kiphisia line has occasioned very serious archaeological involvement (explained in Eleutheros Typos 1.10.92). The lines themselves will be too deep to harm antiquities (i.e. at 20m, while the antiquities generally go no deeper than 7.5m) but the 19 stations (about half of which will lie within the outer bounds of the anc. city) and the inspection shafts, had to be planned to avoid important known remains. It was obvious that five of the stations (Syntagma, Korai, Makrygianne, Monaster- aki and Kerameikos) would entail major excavation. The work has been divided among three Ephorates and special excavation teams have been recruited. The Byz Ephorate is conducting the excavation at Monasteraki; the 1st Ephorate at Makrygianne, and the 3rd Ephorate the other three, while the 2nd Ephorate is working on some of the outer stations of the network. Much of the work is still in progress though the press throughout the year have published items on new finds as they have been made; a summary to date was presented by L. Parlama at a lecture and printed (with map) in Bema 31.1.93 with an update in a press release published in Eleutherotypia 11.3.93 et al. The finds to date may be summarized as follows (based on the above accounts except as noted). Inside the walls: ECh remains at Monasteraki; finds from the Makrygian- ne area are well known and include a HL and a R bath complex with a tiled water channel to the N. Outside the walls: Work had not yet started at the Kerameikos but a public cemetery on the road to the Academy is known from work in 1982; further areas of a cemetery have been found as expected at Korai, though surprisingly only on the W of the road; here</page><page sequence="6">8 E.B. FRENCH FIG. 1 R tombs have also come to light (Eleutheros Typos 31.3.93) and a well with fill of sherds (Apogeumatine 23.2.93). The Syntagma area promised to be the most interesting as this area (at the E of the square) has never been excavated (it was laid out as a square immediately under the new plan for Athens as the capital). So far tomb enclosures have been found and a handsome water channel; those elements that lie on the ramp for the crane, rather than in the station area proper, will be placed on view in the finished station. Yet another R bath complex has come to light (other similar remains adjacent are known at Panepistimiou and Voukourestiou and under the flower shops on the comer of the square itself). Part of a cemetery on an anc. hill lies beneath the baths. Other finds here include a road (Apogeumatine 18.2.93) and a workshop for C bronze statues (Ethnos 23.12.92). It is also now obvious from work along this line that Bouliagmenis is an anc. road with tombs on either side. Outside the walls. The most important new evidence is that of Myc workshops dating from LH IIIA2 to IIIC, including the mould for a ring and a scrap of pumice and two whole pots (stirrup jar and unpainted krater) in the area of the later Iera Odos cemetery. (ADelt 40 Chr, 28-9) Further finds from this cemetery consist of a 1st Ct AD tomb enclosure, a 3rd Ct AD sarcophagus, 41 tombs dating from the end of the 4th CT BC to the beginning of the 1st (unrobbed but poor, confirming previous evidence) and containing clay tear bottles (1-13 per grave), small bronze and iron items (of particular interest are an iron key and pair of scissors) and nails attesting the use of wooden biers. Inscrip- tions were noted: AIZXPION/TITOH; AIONYSIOZ/KAEN- OY/AYZIMAXEYZ; XPIZIMOZ/NIKOTPATOY/nIAATAI- EYE; I/PE. (ADelt 40 Chr, 29-31) In the underpass for the School of Agronomics, important evidence for the Iera Odos itself with 11 relayings came to light, as well as HL houses, pyres with rf pottery (and some A and EC). The stratigraphy begins with EH II, and then provides evidence of continuous use from LG to Ott. (ADelt 40 Chr, 32-3) The cemetery on the road from the Dipylon to the Academy was investigated in three areas. The earliest find was an amphora of the 3rd quarter of the 7th Ct BC with many pots; other tombs dated from the 5th Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD. Inscriptions are recorded: (XQTHPIX/TITOH; FAAATHI/- MIAHfIIO). (ADelt 40 Chr, 31-3) In the area of the Academy itself a test excavation near the peristyle house produced no further evidence but was continued as a stratigraphic investigation; levels of Byz, R, end of the 4th Ct BC, EH and early EH and finally N are noted. (ADelt 40 Chr, 33-4) Other burials came to light just to the S of the city wall on Tsame Karatasou 35-7, by the Stadium opposite Agras 5 and at Bouliagmeni and Chersiphronos. (ADelt 40 Chr, 14, 28) HL structures of note came to light in two areas: at Lempese 23 (just outside the city wall) walls and a silo of three building phases seem to be part of a known complex; in Ano Petralona, at Aioleon 54 and Psamathes, the N facade of an outside wall or terrace was cleared, covered apparently in wash from the Hill of the Muses. (ADelt 40 Chr, 14-8) Kerameikos. The DAI reports: Excavations: In 1992 excavations to the S and E of the Sacred Gate were continued, in building Y and in the area of the Sacred Way. Building Y: Excavation under Dr Knigge (DAI) of the C buildings Y 1-3 was almost finished this year, but the subsoil with pre-Themistocleian tombs was not explored; this is planned for next year. There were no spec- tacular finds, nor was it possible to recover a cohesive plan for the earliest building Y1. However, the ground plans of its successor Y2 and the renovation Y3, dating respectively from the beginning and the middle of the 4th Ct BC, were recovered in spite of extensive destruction and robbing of their walls. Two large rooms were found in the N last year with a court- yard S of them. This year's examination of the sparsely preserved remains showed that Y2 apparently had no other rooms. The lines of the poros foundations with their robbing pits made it possible to reconstruct a large peristyle S of the two rooms which enclosed a small court. Only the S half of the court was preserved, the N one had been destroyed by a pit dug for robbing the peristyle foundation. However, the S half gave information about the layout of the court during the two successive building phases of Y2 and Y3. It seems that when the peristyle of Y2 was built, at the beginning of the 4th Ct BC at the latest, the court was edged with marble slabs (Fig. 1). The total S side was preserved, including a box-shaped conduit on the slabs which served to carry off rain water from the peristyle roof. In the second phase, when Y2 was renovated in the middle of the 4th century BC, slabs and conduit were buried under a layer of marble fragments which formed the floor of the court, cut into by round holes of ca. 70-90cm diam., which were 30- 40cm deep. Nine holes which ran parallel to the marble edge were totally or partially cleared. There were traces of similar holes on the N side. One can only guess at their use: they may have contained clay vessels which collected water from the peristyle roof or perhaps from the cisterns nearby. Few artifacts were found in buildings Y2 and 3; only their ground plans gave a clue to their function: a building with only two large rooms and an even larger peristyle cannot have been a private house. The proportions and size of rooms A and B and the off-centre position of the doors show that at least room B was furnished with couches and was a banqueting room. B had room for 11 couches, A, if furnished similarly, for only nine of unequal size. The combination of banqueting rooms</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 9 tracks confirms this interpretation.

FIG. 2 with peristyle in front is typical for dining halls connected with sanctuaries. The position of building Y at the edge of the Sacred Way on the one hand and its close proximity to building Z (which was a private house in the 5th Ct BC) on the other suggests both cult and secular use for the building. The evidence for both possibilities is as follows: based on Pausan- ias' description, N. Papacharis places the temple of Demeter, Kore and Iakchos, for which Praxiteles made the cult statues, just E of Y. As a banqueting house of this type, Y could have been connected with the temple, thus serving a religious function. On the other hand, its position in a residential area close to the congested Sacred Gate suggests a profane use as tavern or wine shop, a place where Athenians and strangers could meet and hold symposia. It is possible that building Y is identical with the synoikia of Euktemon mentioned by Isaios, "in the Kerameikos, close to the small gate... where wine is sold". Sacred Way. In spring and autumn excavations took place E of the gate under the direction of Dr. B. von Freytag from FIG. 3 the University of Tiibingen. Investigation of the street itself brought surprising proof that in C times the Sacred Way was divided into a carriage-way and a pedestrian side-walk. It was already known that carts and carriages crossed the Eridanus by ford, while on the S side of the street a strip of at least 1.50m width was reserved for pedestrians. Lack of ruts and carriage-</page><page sequence="8">10 E.B. FRENCH FIG. 4 Building survey of the Sacred Gate: This was continued by G. Kuhn and entailed clearing to its full length the foundation of the S curtain-wall consisting of large blocks from the Themistocleian period, which had been excavated by K. Kubler in the 1930's (Fig. 4). Pottery from the building trench on the S side of the socle showed that it dates from the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC and not from Conon's time. The monumental socle of the Sacred Gate and other parts of the city wall in the Kerameikos (for instance the line of polygonal blocks between Dipylon and Sacred Gate) which have been dated to Conon's period up to now, were built according to the evidence in the second half of the 4th Ct BC, probably in 307-4 BC, at the same time as the Dipylon Gate. Restorations, Museum: Permission to restore the endangered curtain-wall of the gate has not yet been granted, but the strengthening of the bull pillar in the precinct of Dionysos of Kollytos was finished (Fig. 5). Our restorer, Yannis Papagrig- oriou, removed the iron clamps (probably inserted at the beginning of this century) and hardened the deeply split blocks of the high socle by injections with lime-cement. With the co- operation of the 3rd Ephorate a projecting roof was completed last year on the E side of the museum. It is a modest substitute for the planned enlargement of the small Kerameikos museum, which unfortunately did not materialize. Its purpose is to protect monuments which have been removed from their place FIG. 5 in the necropolis. Most of them were copied several years ago and the casts were set up in their original position.

In 1985 a wall underwater was noted, extending some 40m and probably a further 30m under the beach; it is similar to others noted previously and seems to belong to the harbour works. It was reused as a foundation more recently and is undoubtedly that seen by Leake. (ADelt 40 Chr, 71-2) Anavyssos.

Theodoroi. (ADelt 40 Chr 78; ADelt 41 Chr 23-4) Eleusis. Six rescue excavations are reported for 1985 (ADelt 40 Chr, 34-6). Of particular importance was one in OT 128 at Persephones 10, where a heavy wall can be assigned to a public building, probably the shrine of Dolichos, as it lies some 100m N of the gateway identified by Travlos as that of this shrine. The masonry of the S face is pseudoisodomic of the 4th/3rd Ct BC but there were subsequent alterations. Evidence of a new cemetery came to light in OT 185 on Kougioumtz- oglou, where a group of 86 tombs, lying closely parallel to one another, were surrounded by a boundary wall. The time span is G through A and C to the end of the 5th Ct BC. The tombs are mainly pyres in bronze vessels. In OT 130 at Ploutonos 5, R private houses and workshops, apparently with kilns, were found; notable was a deposit of murex shells. Opposite OT 2a in the harbour area a fill of anc. material used in a breakwater came to light, but its source cannot be identified. This may be part of the anc. harbour. Wells in two areas (OT 122 and 183) produced interesting material: the former, of the end of the 2nd to the beginning of the 3rd Ct AD, contained an inscribed lamp (AHNAIOY) while the latter had fills dating from the 7th Ct with PAttic and Cor, of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC and C of the 5th and 4th Cts BC.

On the N edge of the town work in 1985 on founda- tions for the new medical centre brought to light PR material of the 2nd half of EH II and early EH III; there were five underground chambers, six wells, two sumps and a pit, as well as clear evidence of lead and bronze working. The pottery and small finds were of considerable interest and importance. The use of these features, apparently for storage or manufacture, has been discussed by O. Kakavogianne in SIMA 76 (1986) 37- 9. Some G pottery was also identified. (ADelt 40 Chr, 66-9) Laurion. E. Nkine-Tsophopoulou reports the find in 1985 (at OT 131 on Erakleous) of LR remains of the S and parts of the E and W walls of the S adjoining structures of an ECh basilica discovered in 1981 some 17m NE of the excavations, the first such ECh building found in the area. A fully preserved lamp found here dates to the late 5th/ E 6th Ct. The exceptionally fine mosaic floor around the altar (found in 1981, AR 1989-90, 9) was removed and restored.

In 1985 by the road from Marathon (village) to Oinoe along the Xeropotamou, in the course of bringing water to E Attica from Lake Marathon, an area of close-packed LA and C tombs of all kinds came to light, of children and young people. Other burials are known from the area but the bound- aries of the new group were not found. (ADelt 40 Chr, 73-4) Megara. For 1985 there is the customary detailed account of extensive rescue excavation (17 sites) with map. (ADelt 40 Chr, 38-46) The underground chambers which are such a feature at Megara were found on four sites; they included one with later burial in one comer, one unusually small, and one of extraordi- nary triangular shape. The association with both domestic pottery and loomweights continues. Building remains, usually badly disturbed, belong either to the HL period or to LR/EByz. One of the former has a small section of 3rd Ct BC mosaic. One of the latter is part of a large villa with well-plastered walls, showing evidence of orthostats and marble floors. Evidence of Byz workshops was found in the SE quadrant of the town with three circular 'cisterns' and a well linked to them. A section of the N face of the city wall, mainly pre- served only to the lowest course and showing some repairs can be dated to the end of the 5th/ beginning of the 4th Ct BC. Tombs were found on six sites; the majority were sarcophagi of the 5th to 2nd Ct BC (where datable). The presence of one group outside the W wall would indicate a gate in this area. One is of interest in that the pottery accompanying the three skeletons is not all of the same date (PCor and 5th Ct) thus showing repeated use of the sarcophagus. Kaza. On the W slope of Eleutherai cut by the old road to Thebes were two Myc cist tombs which are dated to LH II (though a stirrup jar is mentioned). (ADelt 40 Chr, 46) Nea Liosia. Sewage works at Ag. Georgiou in 1985 disclosed a clay larnax, a pyre and two sarcophagi which though empty of bones contained a quantity of pottery of the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC, apparently left behind when reburial took place. It is suggested that this was an isolated area of burial, not a major cemetery. On Theras 3, LR tombs appear to be part of a larger cemetery or group. (ADelt 40 Chr, 50) Nea Makre. The bringing of piped water from the Marathon Lake to E Attica in 1985 revealed outside the gate of the American base the remains of a burial pithos with 20 5th Ct BC pots; further investigation brought to light a tile grave of the end of the 5th Ct with 17 pots, another pithos, traces of pyres, three C cists and one pit grave. This would seem to be the cemetery of anc. Probalinthos. (ADelt 40 Chr, 72-3) Palios Oropos. In 1985 a R vaulted tomb came to light here containing one skeleton and one pot; other evidence of R/LR settlement in the area had been noted previously and it is suggested that refugees from the coastal site at Skala Oropou moved inland in ECh times. (ADelt 40 Chr, 72) Piraeus. Nine excavations, mainly rescue, are reported for 1985 (ADelt 40 Chr, 47-50). On the E side of the Mounichia, during work to develop the upper of the two parallel roads circuiting Mikrolimani, part of the city wall with gate was discovered, running parallel with the road. The lower two courses formed a wider foundation and there was 4th Ct BC wash on the inside. The monument was left visible. Other work produced features common in the outer areas of the town: wells, cisterns, drains and quarries, with some evidence of housing but no notable new discoveries.</page><page sequence="10">12 E.B. FRENCH Rente. Part of a small family cemetery came to light; three 4th Ct tombs had been destroyed by the bulldozer but various finds were retrieved. Another similar cemetery found some 20 years ago is mentioned. (Nike 14.1.93) Porto Raphte (anc. Prasies). Work continued in 1985 in the Papakontane plot (AR 1991-92, 9); buildings of HL and LR were cleared. In a plot to the N was a layer with Myc pottery. A number of architectural remains were recovered (terracotta sima, sculptures and inscriptions, texts not given) and demon- strate the need to excavate the shrine here. These Bourleza. Test excavation following initial finds revealed a wall some 20m in length, probably a terrace. This site lies on the road from Steiria to Prasies; finds date from ripe C to EHL. Ramnous. B. Petrachos publishes the detailed account of his work in 1989 (with full texts of the inscriptions) in PAE, 1-37. In 1992 he continued work within the E gate of the fort, clearing the road from the gate to the small plateia with the dedications, and another narrower one of the last phase, also leading to the plateia. The road from the gate leads on S to a rectangular building, probably military in use, of which the monolithic left jamb and threshold still survive. The excavation showed that the buildings of this area were covered with soil only after a period of abandonment, either of the area or the whole fort. Among new inscriptions, one of the 4th Ct BC reads [6poc; oiKia; [7e]7pa|RtvnT; Epavnatvoo t[o]t;S SEvo- 7£i0eo. Several portions of decrees came to light, among which one by the Council of Athens is dated to the archonship of Agathokles in 106/5 BC. The most important however is another of the Athenian Council under the unknown Archon Asklepidos (inscribed on a slab bearing a dedication to Aphrodite) allowing the Strategos of the Shore, Euthykrates son of Euthykrates Myrrinousios, to proceed with repairs to the fort following damage by pirates. On the information we have on the life of this Strategos, the earliest date for the decree would be the 2nd decade of the 1st Ct BC. On the other side of the site two very small A heads in Parian marble, a kouros and a herm, came to light. Further work was carried out on the tidying of the S road, from the small circular peribolos to the sanctuary of Nemesis; the W terracing was found and also a wall orientated to the E. Notable is the widening of the road for the last stretch before the sanctuary, making use of a stone pile on the E, probably a rough fortification dating from the Chremonidian war. In the area were found sling stones and balls showing enemy attack. Some 5m N of, and related to, the small 5th Ct BC temenos (which itself lies NW of the sanctuary) was a rough building complex. It seems to be connected to some kind of folk worship and is possibly a Thesmophorion. The funerary peribolos of Ierokles was reconstructed incorporating all the available remains. (Ergon 1992, 1-7) Kathemerine 30.8.92, in a feature article, summarizes recent work and discusses the threat to the site from adjacent quarries. Nike tes kyriakes 24.1.93 features the site in its series on the Museums of Greece. Skala Oropou. S of the sea wall an area largely dedicated to manufacture was cleared in 1985. A HL wall had been destroyed by the construction of a kiln in the 1st Ct BC and part of the earlier structure rebuilt as a work area. The kiln, which had many interesting constructional features, including repairs, seems to have been for building materials. Below the floor was a deposit containing heavy vessels and murex shells. Adjacent was a rubbish pit and part of a well (abandoned in LR) and a double kiln (starting in the 1st Ct AD) which had undergone heavy usage and repairs. Though problems remain it is suggested that this kiln was for the manufacture of glass using the new blowing technique. (ADelt 40 Chr, 69) Trachones. Kathemerine 1.8.92 discusses the restriction of building of this area with important antiquities. Overbuilding is nevertheless reported in Eleutherotypia 20.11.92 though protests against this followed (Eleutheros Typos 27.11.92). Varkiza. On Aphrodites, 300m SE of the Myc cemetery, a single C tomb of Hymettian marble came to light in 1985 with one body and a marble alabastron. (ADelt 40 Chr, 66) Voula and Ano Voula (AR 1991-92, 7, 9). Four pieces of rescue work are reported for 1985 (ADelt 40 Chr, 54-62). In the hilly area (OT 241 &amp; 245) on the NE of the settlement more of the terracing previously investigated was cleared; one stretch runs at right angles to the road lines and is assumed to be a boundary wall. In OT 158 (Delphon) work was carried out adjacent to that of the previous year which revealed the small shrine; the roadway was found bending to the NE around the shrine and cutting off in a later phase what had originally been direct entrance to the shrine. The area is very complex and the remains are near the surface. Blocks of housing with dividing passages could be identified; these seem to date from the 5th/4th Cts BC and were definitely in use throughout the 4th Ct BC. In OT 156, in an adjacent but previously unexplored area, a house complex using the two terraces of difficult terrain was cleared; the area had been much disturbed by usage as a German gunnery range in WWII. In OT 188 (Aidiniou, at the centre of Ano Voula) by an anc. roadway, a structure where four building phases could be identified is particularly interest- ing for its relation to houses from Olynthus; it would seem that the bath and chimney areas have been cleared, though there are problems of access and of drainage. Other rooms produced no evidence of usage though one (F) had much pottery. Pegadakia. Excavation in OT 311 in the area known as Palaiochori, between Voula and Varkiza, revealed more of the cemetery as well as housing and road terraces; the area had been much robbed out in the 1920s. A detailed report is given of a building complex with open court and many periods of heavy usage; pottery including good bg and many amphoras can be dated to the end of the 5th Ct to LHL. A well produced a stele (4th Ct BC on the basis of its lettering) with an inscription giving the deme: Atoe0iq6; /EoKpaxouS / 'AX- at£i(; and below the rosettes: EocKparTq /Ato0ei8ou / 'AXka6iS (space) 'Avqoay6pop/ 'Iepo6CvTro; 'A]at- eo; OyaUtlp /E0oKpp6a[o]J[S] yuvfi. Other walling to the E with 5th Ct sherds (some early) would seem to be related to the cemetery and not domestic. In the adjacent Priphte plot (OT 309) 14 tombs of various types dating from 450-420 BC came to light; these can be assigned to the main and important part of the cemetery, both from their position and from their relationship to the tumulus.

On Strategou Petrite, 150m E of Kolonna, an area with three of the R roads of the city was</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 13 investigated; particularly important was the discovery of a road junction with small plateia. One artery ran along the shore, another on the line of the mod. road and the cross wall ran from Kolonna to the E linking the two. At least one of the houses found in the area must date to HL but all have been much destroyed by pistachio planting. On Telamonos part of the 5th Ct BC city wall running N-S was cleared; it stands to six courses on its inner face. The central fill had sherds of LA- EC. The constructional detail, of considerable importance, is reported; it is notable that the stone was quarried on the site. Rescue work in the town (7 sites reported) exposed part of the city's water system in a plot opposite the Cathedral, but much of the remains elsewhere had been severely disturbed. Three LA graves of the S cemetery, of known type with underground chambers, but destroyed, came to light at These Chalikaki. Kolona. In a campaign lasting three weeks in September 1992 the Archaeological Institute of the University of Salzburg under Dr F. Felten and Dr S. Hiller, produced a new actual- state plan of the PR settlement which lies W of the A temple of Apollo, without carrying out new excavations. The settle- ment had been excavated by Gabriel Walter before WWII, but had never been published. The plan shows a town of rectangu- lar structures on both sides of a road running E-W. Several settlement phases were observed without any great change in the architecture. In all probability the town dates from the MBA; it has weathered badly since excavation and seems in considerable danger. Dokos (AR 1991-92, 10).

Williams II (ASCS) reports on his work on Frankish Corinth in 1992: "The excavation now being conducted immediately S of the archaeological site museum of anc. Corinth has unearthed more than 1,400 m2 of the Frankish city. Monuments thus far revealed include a gravelled court, over 500m2 of which has been exposed. The N end of that court is defined by a church and the E side by a porticoed structure or series of structures. The W side is defined by two separate buildings: unit 1 with a colonnade along its E face and unit 2, without a colonnade and partially confined by the S hall of the nearby church. Demonstrably independent of each other, units 1 and 2 are separated by a passageway 1.29-1.35m wide that offers access to the gravelled court from the NW. Lack of evidence for doors or gates either along this NW passage, or along the other public road which gives access into the NE corer of the court, suggests limited ingress. The gravelled court must have been public in function. The S side of the NW passage is defined by the N end wall of unit 1. Unit 1 stretches S from the passage in the form of three almost equal rooms, now called rooms 1, 2 and 3, a narrow, E-W corridor and, continuing S, rooms 4 and 5. Access to rooms 1 through 4 is made through a series of doors in the E wall of the unit, although room 4 also has a small door in its SW comer through which one gains access to the paved court on the W side of unit 1. When cleared room 1 had no identifying characteristics which help to determine the function of the space. Room 2, however, can be identified, at least in its final phase, as some sort of kitchen. In its original state the room had been paved with square terracotta tiles, between 28 and 30cm to a side, bedded on marl. At the W end of the room is preserved a large rectangular hearth that rises well above the tiled floor. The debris and clay that covered the paving tiles around the hearth were heavily mixed with ash and small bones. The function of room 3 is not clear, but between its lowest floor and a resurfacing was found a heavy concentrae tion of charcoal and black ash, within which was mixed a large amount of iron and some bronze waste. The iron waste from a large pit dug within this room (pit 1992-93) reinforces the evidence that was gathered from between the floors. One is tempted to identify this space as a smithy, at least before a reorganization of the room, when it was resurfaced and a N-S partition wall was added as a subdivision. The E-W corridor separating rooms 3 and 4 is not like the passage between units 1 and 2. Passage was definitely con- trolled by one door at its E end and by a second one at its W</page><page sequence="12">14 E.B. FRENCH end; the function apparently was to limit circulation between the gravelled court E of unit 1 and the more elegant, paved W court. A comparison of the W court with its fitted paving blocks of poros and the larger, E public court with its gravelled surface, mixed with bone, tile and sherds, demonstrates the marked difference in care and cost that was expended for the surfacing of these two outdoor spaces. Unit 1 has abutted to its W exterior wall a room that is of a width similar to that of its rooms 1, 2 and 3; this space will be referred to as the annex of unit 1 for, although the annex abuts units 1, its walls do not bond into the side of the unit proper, nor is there direct access between the main rooms of the unit and the annex. Finally, the annex does not have the same orientation as the rooms to which its is appended. The annex is not yet fully excavated. The hearth against its N wall does not guarantee identification of the room as a kitchen, nor even a hall for eating. This hearth varies in form from that in room 2 of unit 1 and, apparently, served a different function. Although of about the same size as the hearth in room 2, it is raised to a height of only about 10cm above the surrounding floor. Careful excavation of the ash within it produced not one bone, suggesting, perhaps, that this fireplace served only to heat and not for cooking. The Frankish fortress at Clemoutsi (Clermont) still preserves traces of a number of fireplaces both on the ground and the main floor; many of these must have served only to provide warmth within the castle rooms. As the annex defines the N side of the paved court W of unit 1, it also serves to define the S side of a third open space. This space appears to be a working court that lies between the annex and the NW passage. N of the court and the NW passage into the gravelled court stands unit 2. Although only incompletely exposed this unit now appears to be a series of rooms that should be related to the church at the head of the gravelled court. Two of the rooms, numbered 1 and 2, are completely excavated; a third, large space W of the first two has its N and still covered by unexcavated fill. Four partially excavated spaces, numbered 4 and 7, are built against the main body of the church. Spaces 4 and 5 were not necessarily ever roofed; spaces 6 and 7 appear to have been for the relationship of these last four spaces to the church, their walls about its W facade and N flank, showing that the church was not freestand- ing, at least not at the time of its destruction by the Catalans in 1312. It is here assumed that unit 2 is closely related to the church and the different spaces may all be components of a single many-roomed ecclesiastical complex. future excavation, it is hoped, will be able to determine the exact relationship of spaces 1 through 7 to the church." Isthmia. Dr E. Gebhard (ASCS) reports: "In 1992, the entire staff of the University of Chicago expedition spent time at the site for study of the objects and architecture that they are preparing for the final publications. Examination of objects from the Archaic temple yielded heavily burnt Attic pottery that establishes a destruction date around 470 BC. Large numbers of amphoras with heavily burnt interior surfaces suggest that oil and perhaps wine were stored inside the cella at the time of the fire, while a concentration of aryballoi, alabastra, and other fine pottery, jewelry, coins, and imported objects were kept in the pronaos. Virtually all the context pottery from the sanctuary, excluding the Large Circular Pit that was studied last year, was examined for vases dating between ca. 700 and 550 BC. The results were as follows: drinking vessels, especially kotylai, predominate; types show continuity with the 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC; a number of Lakonian pieces were imported in the later 7th and 1st half of the 6th Ct, but no certainly Attic examples; miniatures are largely confined to kalathiskoi; substantially whole vessels are remarkably rare at Isthmia. In the late 6th and 5th Ct BC bg, single-handled mugs, (one inscribed 'kothon' and another 'sacred to Poseidon') occur in at least eight different fabrics and in such high numbers that they were probably dedications. The mugs are concentrated in the same areas as the arms and armour (NW Terrace and Large Circular Pit), leading to the suggestion that they were left by soldiers and travellers. Pieces of worked poros found in the 1989 excavations of the E Terrace were identified as the remains left from fluting the columns of the Classical temple (3,062 fragments). On the basis of the column's entasis, the curved surfaces of the fragments reveal their location on the shaft. Fasciae were carved on 95 examples belonging to the upper edges of the drums, and ten of these carried inscribed notations consisting of 2-5 vertical strokes followed by a single letter. Two pieces had incised arrows. The incisions were filled with red pigment. Study of architectural pieces from the N side of the temenos revealed that they came from a small Doric building of a size and shape to have stood on a nearby foundation of ashlar blocks (M 5). It seems likely it was a free-standing gateway. The deposit in which the Doric blocks occurred also contained fragments from the C Temple of Poseidon, a public inscription of 220 BC, and pottery of the E 3rd Ct BC. Severe damage appears to have been inflicted on monu- ments in the temenos in ca. 200 BC, perhaps by enemy action, and the debris was then cleaned up and used for terracing. Again in the E Terrace numerous fragments of columns from the C Temple of Poseidon were found in deposits of about 100 AD related to construction of the first R temenos wall and associated landscaping. Their size and quantity indicate that at least some of the columns in the peristyle were replaced at that time, and it may be that the entire colonnade was rebuilt. The marble sculpture not included in Isthmia IV amounted to almost 300 fragments. They yielded joins to three statues previously known and provided evidence for five new ones, bringing in total to eight over-life-sized R portrait statues of the 2nd Ct AD, possibly the 2nd half. The entire group very likely stood in the Antonine Palaimonion, and from the scale and clothing it represented important persons, such as emperors, officials, priests or early Corinthian kings. In the Rachi Settlement progress was made in reconstructing the plans of the houses and workshops and in identifying three long passages running along the ridge and one that crossed it. Destruction deposits were dated to ca. 200 BC on the basis of coins of Philip V, a Rhodian stamped amphora handle, and Athenian pottery; relief (Megarian) bowls were absent. The presence of 12 weapons (sling bullets, spear tips, and javelin sockets) suggests that enemy action may have caused the destruction. (Cf. N temenos above)" Professor T.E. Gregory reports: "Fieldwork at Isthmia in 1992 sponsored by the Ohio State University took place from January to September, with most activity in July and August. Our primary focus this year was the continued conservation of the monochrome mosaic in the R bath, discovered in 1976 and lifted in 1990. Last year the area under the mosaic had been filled with soil and a layer of stones placed above this. In April of 1992 a layer of cement was poured over the stones to form a firm foundation upon which the mosaic could be relaid. Conservation began with the preparation of a mortar mixture that precisely matched the original mortar bedding for the mosaic, both in colour and in</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 15 texture. The individual sections of mosaic were then laid, in their original location, in a new bedding of mortar. When this had dried, the cloth covering the surface and holding the tesserae in place was removed, the surface was cleaned, and preparations were made to fill the spaces between the mosaic panels with a thin line of tesserae, laid in place by hand. Re- laying of the mosaic panels began at the W end of the room and proceeded toward the E. Each row of panels contained seven individual pieces, and by the end of the season three rows, for a total of 21 panels, had been relaid. This work is naturally painstaking and slow and great care had to be exercised in the early stages of the undertaking. We hope that the task of relaying the whole mosaic may be completed during the 1993 season. During the 1991 season we had noted that road construction carried out by land developers was threatening the safety of the underground NW Reservoir and its associated water lines, excavated by Oscar Broneer and published by him in lsthmia II. Early in the 1992 season we noticed that the anc. vertical water shaft leading down into this system had been filled with debris, apparently at the time the roadway was created. With the permission of the Ephorate we cleaned out the manhole and the water system, down to a depth of 6.5m below the mod. surface. We also shored up various places in the water system where the waterproof cement had fallen away and we placed a large cement cap, reinforced with iron, at the top of the manhole. Further fieldwork was carried out in the area of the R bath, where we cleaned out several trenches excavated in previous years. Thus, we examined the foundations of the E wall of the bath, excavated in 1978, and we found that the stone and rubble foundations there go down ca. 1.4m below the floor level in the bath. To the E of this wall there was a structure, ca. 2m N-S and at least 1.3m E-W, whose floor and sides are made of tiles simply set in the soil. This structure, which is very similar to another discovered by Oscar Broneer N of the Temple of Poseidon, was probably simply a surface for the mixing and preparation of clay, presumably used in the construction or maintenance of the bath and perhaps in the manufacture of tiles placed on the building. In room IX excavation in 1977 and 1978 revealed a cement floor on which the hypocausts of the R bath had been placed. Later investigation showed that this cement surface was the floor of the Gr period pool. This floor had been cut by two long straight cuttings, one running nearly N-S near the W side of the room, the other E-W between the springings for the apse at the S end. In 1992 we looked again at these cuttings, which probably represent foundations for walls that no longer exist in the bath. Investigation of the N-S cutting revealed no trace of special foundations, but merely the packing that was encoun- tered elsewhere under the floor of the Gr pool. One may therefore suggest that there had been no substantial wall along this line, but perhaps some feature associated with the Gr bath. The E-W cutting, however, was filled with foundations made of tiles and mortar, certainly of R date, presumably to support a wall no longer extant, from a phase of the R bath earlier than the present arrangement. In cleaning a trench excavated in 1976 in the SW corer of room XIII we rediscoverd a furnace that heated the pool on the S end of the room. This was remarkably well preserved and it has features that are not represented in the other five furnaces previously studied. S of the bath we investigated an area excavated in 1978 and 1980 and described as the S Lamp Deposit. Work this year allowed greater knowledge of the area and provided evidence of two stratigraphic horizons, the earlier assignable to the orig- inal R bath phase in the 2nd Ct AD and the second phase in which the lamps were previously found associated with the abandonment of the bath around 400 AD. Also to the S of the bath we cleaned a trench excavated in 1972. Close stratigraphic investigation provided evidence of ground levels and construc- tion assignable to the Gr period, above which there was massive levelling in R times. In addition to these investiga- tions, we continued study of the architecture and finds exca- vated in previous years, especially in the area of the R bath. Progress toward publication of this important monument (see restored plan Fig. 6) is well under way." I- FIG. 6 Kenchreai. D.

Tests were made at the NW corer of the C altar. The lowest levels of the altar were checked and it was found to rest on fill dating to the 4th Ct BC giving a terminus post quem for the altar. There is also evidence for a further supporting structure beneath the altar, probably because of the unstable ground at this point. (Ergon 1992, 8-20) Iria.

Valachou) took the form of a large scale project of restoration and cleaning on the acropolis. The restoration included repair to the fortification wall. Some collapsed blocks were restored to their original position at two points on the inner face of the wall near the E gate and on the NE section (Fig. 7). The walls of the excavated buildings on the acropolis were strengthened with white cement and earth to prevent them from collapsing. This work involved the walls aces and some parts of the W gate of th walls of Myc buildings near the W gate (Fig. 8). The extensive cleaning covered most of the acropolis. The excavated areas were thoroughly cleared of weeds (Fig. 9 E gate; Fig. 10 area of the W gate). The earth and stones from the 1983-91 excavations were removed and placed in specific places on the acropolis (Fig. 11). The paths leading to the monuments were also cleared to facilitate the approach for visitors. Study of the finds was continued. The Myc pottery found, especially in the area of the W gate, is abundant and of great interest. The LH IIIB2 pottery found in the area of the W gate can be closely parallelled in the two major domestic pottery groups of this date from Mycenae and Tiryns (Figs. 12-15). Pictorial pottery was found similar to that from other major Argive centres; this depicts mainly birds and quadrupeds. In addition two fragmen- tary vases, a narrow-necked jug with birds and a bell krater with a chariot scene were restored from fragments.

On the Panagia ridge some 100m S of the Treasury of Atreus (and 50m S of the fence) a tile grave came to light i containing a 5th Ct bg lekythos and an iron strigil. Nearby was a heavy Myc wall associated with a floor covered by a layer of burnt destruction with an LH III stirrup jar. Further details are given of the excavation near the site of the new Museum (AR 1985-6, 27). A Myc terrace was cleared 50m N of the Cyclop- ean wall and 50m E of the Lion Tomb. It dates to LH III and comprised 20 rooms; two phases were noted and a final destruction in LH IIIB/C. Roughly interred skeletons were. found in rooms 1 and 7 and cist burials in rooms 17 and 20, the latter with bronzes (2 cauldrons, 20 axes and an unusual wedge-shaped tool). A number of tripod mortars indicate that the area was a workshop similar to the one discovered 30m NW in 1979. An LH II child grave and a drain containing MH sherds were also discovered. The area was refilled after excavation. (ADelt 40 Chr, 91-2) Professor Sp. Iakovides reports his excavation in 1989 in the area immediately NE of the Lion gate in PAE, 38-43.

Mitsopoulou-Leon reports on her work for the Austrian Institute in 1992: " Residential area 'Phournoi': continuing last year's work, excavations concentrated on the buildings in the N sector of the lower terrace. The purpose was the complete clearance of FIG. 13 the room containing the hearth and the recovery of the latter; furthermore the type of buildings on the lower terrace had to be established. It is becoming increasingly clear that the lower terrace, too, was a residential area. *- a............. : The Room with the Hearth: the hearth (Fig. 16), half of which was uncovered last year, was removed and taken to the depot of K. Lousoi. It consists of four comer pieces, each ca. Im long. As the fractures at the inner edge show, each piece originally had a bottom plate which was let into the edge. The state of the hearth showed that it was reused at least once in its d1a ne present location, since individual parts were no longer attached to it but formed, mixed with rectangular clay tiles, the broken bottom of the hearth. (The SE corner was broken off and lay onthe fragments of the floor, the gap had been closed with a The bathroom: towards the W extends a room whose floor consists of small pieces of brick set upright in mortar in 50cm wide bands with N-S dividing lines. Debris of bricks and mortar along the S wall came from a hipbath and basin originally built on this spot. A piece of kerb with vertical, straight back and rounded front is preserved in the SW. This FIG. 14 surrounded the floor of the basin, which was made of brick fragments. The SE area is taken up by a smooth mortar base and next to it lies a round catch basin for the bathtub. The N wall has a socle of well-fitted ashlar blocks, on which one course of sun-dried bricks is preserved. The floor stops about 50cm W of the basin and the W wall of the room has been torn out. Under the floor is a drainage channel running W, which after ca. 2m is interrupted by a later N-S wall. In this area there were also two buildings and occupation phases before the destruction, as found in other places. During the first phase, the room with the hip-bath and basin clearly served as a bathroom. In the second phase the room lost its original function: the W wall was removed, tub and basin cut in size and the drainage channel went out of use. After this reorganiz- ation another complex was built in the W, bounded in the E by a wall which blocked the drainage channel under the bathroom. The new installation was provided with a limestone threshold at the NW corner which probably came from the older building with bathroom. Excavations have started in two rooms. From the debris uniformly covering the two rooms of the older phases, which we consider to be the destruction layer, come FIG. 15 two datable finds: a lamp of the type Corinth X (L 3rd to E Ist Ct BC) and a coin of Patras, dated to 146-132 BC.</page><page sequence="18">20 E.B. FRENCH FIG. 16 Area with Basin N of the Room with the Hearth: a rectangular basin built of brick debris and mortar, the inside covered by a layer of mortar, probably belongs to the time before the destruction, and is similar to the basin in the wet room of the lower terrace (AR 1991-92, 17). To the time after the destruction belong some carelessly built small walls which were partly set on the layer of bricks or re-used older walls. Fragments of two lamps of the type Corinth XXVII are dated not before the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct AD and point to the date of the destruction and poor rebuilding in the residential area of Lousoi." Mantinea. In Ergon 1992, 20-22 S. Papamarinopoulos illustrates the use of ground-penetrating radar on the same ground as that previously tested by other methods across the anc. roadway. Megalopolis. Professor Lauter (Marburg) in 1992 carried out work on the Sanctuary of Zeus Soter, in cooperation with the Ephorate. Tegea. In 1992, the 3rd season of the excavation programme was conducted in the sanctuary of Athena Alea at Tegea by the Norwegian Institute at Athens, in collaboration with the Swedish Institute, the French and Italian archaeological schools, the University of Arizona (USA) and Greek colleagues Drs. Th. G. Spyropoulos and A. Delivorrias. Dr 0stby reports: "During earth removal from the upper part of the sanctuary, close to a mod. road, where preliminary excavations in 1990 had shown that fill and foundation walls of mod. village houses reach a depth of ca. 2m, a life-size marble statue of a draped female figure, dressed in a chiton and a himation (Fig. 17), was discovered as part of a retaining wall of recent periods. The style is LHL (both garments carry clear press folds); head and arms are missing and were inserted separately, perhaps for a portrait statue. From rubble walls in the same area some building material (an A geison block, a fragment of an EC Doric capital) was also recovered. The two teams continued their work in the lower part of the N sector, close to the temple. In the sector aligned with the N entrance ramp to the temple, the surface of the sanctuary in use from the construction of the temple until the end of antiquity was reached. This sector appears to have served as an open courtyard, without buildings or other monuments (but finds of tile fragments suggest that buildings existed in the neighbour- hood); throughout this long period of use it was exceptionally well maintained, with only very modest rises in the surface (evidenced e.g. by some scraps of transparent glass). In one of these surfaces, a pair of wheel-ruts made by an unusually wide and heavy transport cart could be identified. A deep pit in the same area, containing various material (ranging from a G bronze horse through fragments of decor- ative mouldings from the C temple to some Byz pottery) is clearly late, and seems also to include the remains of burnt mud-brick observed in 1991 in the adjacent square D7. In that square, the A layers below the surface of the courtyard were</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 21 reached. In the first of these layers traces were found of a light, wooden structure of uncertain size and shape, identified through a series of small post-holes. Beneath this layer, a thick, reddish layer with much debris of burnt mud-brick, some of it with traces of white plaster, was encountered. A semiglobular bronze bowl, found with the spout of an EPCor-MPCor aryballos, is another significant find from this layer, which was this year only superficially investigated. Closer to the temple, two monument bases of the C period discovered by the French excavations of 1910 were again exposed, and the deep trench dug between them in 1910 was opened for a check on the stratigraphical situation close to the temple. The excavation in the temple, between the foundations of the inner colonnades of the EA temple, was continued. The very limited trench opened in 1991 (5 x 2m) was extended to cover the entire width of 3m between the two A foundations, and another square was opened in front of it, also in the full width of the area. During these operations, remains of a second, slightly larger and probably somewhat later cult building were encountered close to the N A foundation. This building appears to have the same apsidal shape as its predecessor, and to have been built around it in the same wattle-and-daub construction technique based on a system of vertical posts inside and outside of the wall, without a stone socle. It may have reached an external width of about 4m-the length remains to be established-and some of the post-holes identified last summer may belong to a line of central beams carrying the roof construction in this building. There are also traces perhaps of an inner bench along the inside of the N wall. The material found with this building is of LG date (much pottery), and cannot at present be easily distinguished from the material to be connected with the earlier building; they may have succeeded each other with a fairly short interval, and the extensive digging for post-holes-whose function to a large extent remains obscure-has left no clear stratigraphy to be connected with either building. Possibly the fairly rich material of L MG-E LG date should be connected with the earlier building. In the area of the pronaos of the C temple, between the two A foundations, another trench was opened. Much of this area had been heavily disturbed by the earlier French excavations, but in an untouched sector a pit filled with clay and metal slag, and connected with MG-LG pottery, was encountered and is clearly evidence for metallurgical activity in the G sanctuary. The pit will be excavated next year, with expert assistance. A preliminary study of the animal bones from the excavation has been made; considerable remains of bones from sacrifices and ritual meals, chosen and treated according to specific rules and criteria, have been recovered from the layers of the two G cult buildings, and will be thoroughly studied as evidence for early ritual. From the C layers of the N area a tooth of a lion has been identified." The small site museum was one of those hit by theft during the current year.

Survey, under the aegis of the BSA, of the upper city at Monemvasia was continued in 1992 by a group of thirteen surveyors from the Extra-Mural Dept. of the University of Manchester led by Dr David Hill. The survey is designed to assist the long-term research on the city by Dr Haris Kalligas and is under her overall direction. The team received the close and fruitful collaboration of Amalia Androulidaki, architect of the 5th Ephorate of Byz Antiquities, Sparta. Some areas of the site are now heavily overgrown with thorn and scrub and were valiantly cleared by local workmen. The two major sites were the cistern known from Venetian sources as the 'Galera' and the gateway complex. The Galera is an impressive two-bay cistern cut into the rock; the cistern and its vaults are in a fine state of preservation. Unfortunately the superstructure and surrounding buildings are largely destroyed by time and stone- robbers. The buildings were fully recorded at the scale of 1:50. It is hoped that the plans and elevations recorded this year will enable the complex to be better understood; the initial structure is Byz. Complex though the Galera is, the gateway on the S cliff is larger and of more phases of construction. Much of the structure exists, but some chambers are difficult of access without specialized climbing techniques and some areas are unstable and dangerous. All of the difficulties are compounded by the fact that the gateway is built on the crest of impressive and sheer cliffs. The survey is complete, though the elevations are only partially recorded. The study of this year's results may suggest additional blocked areas. A long stretch of the city wall was recorded photographi- cally using a cantilevered monopod to enable the outer faces of the defences to be recorded even though they stand at the top of inaccessible cliffs. Preliminary work was conducted on three other sites in advance of the 1993 campaign in the S-W of the city: i.e. the area S of the Galera and up to the House of Kretikos, and the bastion built by the Turks to defend the entrance of the lower city. Work included the clearance of a Byz church site, the beginning of surveying the city walls and the entering of some subterranean structures. Ethnos 28.5.93 reports that plans for a marina have been stopped to preserve the environment. Sparta. Rescue work is reported in five areas. OT 121,124, and 126 revealed parts of the R road system (including elaborate drainage) and parts of the adjacent buildings, often with notable spolia; also in OT 121 was a group of 2nd-3rd Ct AD tombs including one with a cuhiculum. In OT 125 among other R structures was a workshop area and part of a bath complex with two tiled halls; the copious spolia included a 2nd Ct BC grave stele inscribed ALtoCoa XacpE. In OT 127 there was a R complex including pavements with geometric mosaics of the 3rd-4th Ct AD. There was some evidence of the HL period and at least part of the road system seems to have gone out of use in the LR period. (ADelt 40 Chr, 102) Theatre. A programme of survey and excavation was carried out on the site of the anc. theatre at Sparta in 1992 for the BSA by Professor G.B. Waywell of King's College London, and Professor J.J. Wilkes of the Institute of Archaeol- ogy, University College, London. The purpose was to clarify details of the structure partly revealed in the BSA excavations of 1906-9 and 1924-28 so as to enable a scheme for its reconstruction to be drawn up. Following excavation by machine of a new way into the theatre, and removal of many of the architectural blocks laid out in the orchestra, six trenches were opened up in different parts of the theatre, numbered ST 92.I-VI. Excavation of the area left undug in the W part of the orchestra (ST 92.I) revealed two principal phases of med occupation, dating probably to the 9th-10th and 12th- 13th Cts. A sounding over staircase III revealed a layer of sterile wash, reflecting Sparta's abandonment in the 7th-8th Cts, and below this a late antique occupation phase of the 5th or 6th Cts, after the theatre had gone out of use. The blocks making up the orchestra perimeter, drain, front bench and lateral walkway behind it were found to be in position and reasonably well preserved. Trenches ST. 92.II and III were positioned so as to reveal evidence for the horizontal gangway (diazoma) halfway up the theatre cavea. Both areas had been partly excavated in 1909 and 1926, but despite this, significant new information was discovered for the location, width and construction of the diazoma, chief among which was a frag- ment of its marble paving in situ. Trenches ST 92.IV and V were laid out across the top of the cavea, extending to the visible outer retaining wall of the theatre on the E side. They confirmed the existence of the curving back wall of the cavea, the mortared foundations for which are well preserved, and revealed a narrower wall of similarly mortared construction running parallel to it about 6m W towards the cavea. A deep layer of mud-brick make-up lying between the two walls probably served as foundations for a broad walkway that once ran round the top of the theatre. Pottery contained within the mud-brick suggests a terminus post quem of the late 1 st Ct BC for the construction of this part of the theatre. If this interpretation is correct, the upper part of the theatre would have contained 15 rows of seats rather than the 20 suggested by Woodward and de Jong. An attempt to test the upward extension of the seats adjacent to staircase VIIa in trench ST 92.VI proved inconclusive. A full programme of stone recording was begun at Easter and continued in the summer under the direction of Susan Walker. All stones of architectural significance on site from previous and current excavations were numbered, catalogued and photographed. Special attention was paid to the column shafts, capitals and entablatures from the scaenae frons and some progress was made in assigning the extant fragments to a series of orders ranging in date from Augustan to the late 4th Ct.

Work in 1992 by the Austrian Institute concentrated on the clearing of the two small temples D and E, on ethno- archaeological surveys and on the recording of houses. In previous excavations the two temples, situated S of the theatre, were only partially excavated. Wedge-shaped unexcavated sections of earth remained against all walls; as it is intended to roof both buildings, the walls were cleared. Trenches were dug at right angles to the walls in order to determine the strati- graphy and sections were prepared and sketched for the S and W side of temple E as well as the E and N side of temple D. Large quantities of wall plaster and some well-preserved</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 23 fragments of the sima with lion-head water spouts were recovered. The anc. ruins of Aigeira were not built over during the Middle Ages. Only in the 19th Ct was a village built, which was inhabited only at certain times of the year. It was used by farmers during harvest, particularly for the production of raisins. The recording of over 20 houses, in part fairly well- preserved, was begun. Several ground-plans were measured and the contents of the houses, if any, recorded. At the same time information was collected about house types, inventory, ownership details and working conditions. Aigion. For 1985 seven rescue excavations are reported. At Dodecaneson 4 the area had been occupied from Myc times (walls), followed by apsidal structures and a large A kiln (one sherd of 7th Ct Cor); the area was cut by LR foundations and 12 Byz pits (ADelt 40 Chr, 120-3). Another plot at Metropoleos 26 and Messeneze showed evidence of occupation over a long period (HL, R and ECh) again with workshop usage (a R kiln). Over the R building was a tiled tomb. Finds included sculpture, a Doric column capital, pithoi, figurines and coins. (ADelt 40 Chr, 123) Similar evidence including a R mosaic, two wells and a kiln for metal came from a plot at Botsare 5 and Bas. Konstantinou though here the material was all very scattered. (ADelt 40 Chr, 123) The remaining plots produced more evidence of the HL and R occupation periods (including well-preserved R baths) well known from the town. Chalandritsa: Stauros. On the site of the local health centre an LH III B-C settlement was discovered continuing in use until SMyc. It is bounded by the rock and has at least three concentric areas of building with radiating roads; the houses have one or two trapezoidal rooms and are shown to be two- storey by the settings for wooden stairs. The ground floors were used for storage and heating (hearths) with outside cooking area; finds included handmade burnished wares, stone tools, loomweights, some pottery similar to that from Teichos Dymaion and bronze knives; there were child graves below the floors.

LR material was recovered from Parodos Ag. Ioanne. An important programme of site inspections of the areas of the A Dodekapolis was undertaken in cooperation with KERA; sites were identified at Lakkopetra, Mesa Paralimne (formerly Mesa Nkerbesi) and N of Exo Paralimne Araxou.

Illicit excavation in the Brouma area was followed by proper investigation, though this was hampered by the many trees. A structure of two rooms with entrance to the E was cleared; it was assigned to the 2nd-lst Cts BC and filled with a destruction level apparently caused by earthquake. Above were remains of the 1st Ct AD. The base, probably of a statue, of which traces and local knowledge exist, would indicate a small temple site. Some architectural members are preserved as well as a peribolos in pseudoisodomic masonry. To the E are A or C foundations, possibly of earlier temples destroyed in the Elike earthquake of 373-2 BC. (ADelt 40 Chr, 123-7, with plan of the area.) Patras. In 1985 205 rescue excavations were carried out, of which 27 where antiquities were found are reported. (ADelt 40 Chr, 108-120) At Germanou 136, beneath remains dating from Ott to HL, a further section of the Myc ChT cemetery came to light, already identified in this area near the Kastro. The tombs, though missing the upper section, were unrobbed and can be dated to LH IIIA2/B to LH IIIC. In three areas HL levels were found, notably on Archiepiskopou Ierotheou and Themistokle- ous, where there were remains of a house with floors of fine pebbles and hard earth, while at Navarino 15-17 a strong HL enclosure wall had been built on a level of pebble and sherd. The wealth and importance of the R city is clear. Ten areas revealed large houses, notable for their mosaic courtyards, elaborate marbled cisterns, and carefully built walls, largely in opus testaceum but also in other typical techniques. A further seven areas also produced house remains of the R period, though less extensive. At Ag. Demetriou 18 the walls of a LR complex in opus quasi reticulatum rested on strong walls of the</page><page sequence="22">24 E.B. FRENCH HL period; adjacent was a deposit of pottery and figurines of the half-naked Aphrodite type. The R road system was revealed in five areas, all related to the road system already known; of particular importance however was the clearing on Papadiam- ante, parodos Apetha, of another section of the R bridge found in 1981. At Bouboulinas 16 and Othonos Amalias a pavement of slabs in reuse, with concrete in the interstices, was edged on the N by a strong wall, almost certainly a breakwater from the R harbour development. At Gravias 3 on the NW slope of the acropolis a R Terrace Wall of concreted material was found but there was no evidence of occupation; a section of wall in similar technique is visible nearby to the E on Meniate. R kilns were found on Dem. Ypselantou 26 and on the E slope of the Frourion; here were also some 16 LR tile and cist tombs. The depth of the strata due to the slope precluded access to earlier levels. Sporadic evidence of ECh and Ott burials was found throughout. On Kalabryton a long narrow stretch of the SE cemetery was excavated during the laying of sewerage pipes along the road and a further small area of the NE cemetery was excavated on Kephallenias-Thessalonikes. Ano Sykaina. Previous to the construction of a warehouse an area of some 7 stremmata was investigated and a C country house revealed. A storage area had three pithoi and a mortar in the corers while the adjacent room produced a large number of loomweights. An enclosed area at the SW may, on analogy with Olynthos, be a bath (but no drainage system was found). The building had been destroyed by earthquake followed by fire which left a heavy layer of debris. (ADelt 40 Chr, 108-20) Saravali. A.

Four LC cist tombs came to light during sewage work; two were unrobbed. One contained seven pots and a bronze brooch; the other, which was used twice, yielded 25 pots of which eight were from the earlier burial. These tombs belong to the S cemetery lying by the anc. roadway. At Pazaropoulo a 7th Ct shrine was found in deep ploughing with part of a monolithic fluted column. Within the archaeological area the enclosure for a well was found, with terracotta upper section; it was covered by a limestone slab.

Papapostolou publishes the account of his work in 1989 in PAE, 123-4 and he discusses the problems of megarons A and B in AE 1990, 129, 191-200. In 1992 (Ergon, 41-52) excavation continued in the area of the E stoa as far as its original S end. The stoa had evidently been shortened at that end in the post 206 BC reconstruction, leaving part of the burnt columns in situ beyond. Excavation was also conducted within the area of the Apollo temple, to confirm the nature of the PR remains first exposed by Soteria- des (1898) and Rhomaios (1913-4) and recover, if possible, evidence for the date of megaron B and the 'peristyle' appar- ently added to it later. Excavation was complicated here by the unrecorded drystone walls inserted by Sotiriades to support the stylobate and column bases of the temple. A destruction level found at a depth of between 1-1.38m below the temple stylobate beside the W wall, underlay megaron B and con- tained burnt mud-brick debris and pottery of LH IIIA2-IIIB date. Parts of two stone walls may also belong to this level. Most of the E wall (18.29m) of megaron B was re-exposed, together with about half of the W wall and the whole of the N wall. The slight curve in this wall was found to result from pressure and was not a feature of the original construction as often claimed in the past. A few slabs may belong to the floor reported by Rhomaios and these were covered by a clean yellowish mud-brick debris level suggesting gradual rather than sudden destruction. The pottery was for the most part undiag- nostic and contained sherds of LH IIIA2-IIIB pottery as well as a few pieces of matt painted ware. No recognisable LH IIIC was present. Megaron B could thus be dated at any time from LH IIIB to C, though C14 analysis of charred seeds from the level above may help to resolve this. Examination of one of the 'peristyle' base slabs showed it to rest on loose earth over a destruction level, which in turn covered a yellowish layer equivalent to that within the megaron itself. Another base slab rested on a burnt layer at the same level as the black layer immediately underlying the temple walls. These first investiga- tions thus indicate that the 'peristyle' postdates the destruction of megaron B. The remains of megaron B have been left exposed to view and protected under a shelter.

The press once again features the theory that Kephallenia is the Ithaca of the Odyssey with many small articles (e.g. Eleutheros Typos 21.12.92) and a long feature in Eikones 2.9.92. Ithake. S. Symeonoglou publishes an account of his work in 1989 in PAE, 292-5. In 1992 (Ergon, 91-2) he continued the exploration of the area of the Temple of Apollo at Aetos where 14m of a monumental (Cyclopean) structure have been disclosed in a built pit. Sherd evidence shows that this dates from at least PG but the masonry suggests an even earlier date. It was repaired several times and finally destroyed by earth- quake in the 4th Ct BC. Near the base of the subsidiary wall A was found the nearly complete skeleton of a cow/bull, burned and with cut marks, probably the remains of a sacrifice; Myc sherds were found in this area (see also Siren 8). Damage to the harbour of the site is reported in Eleutherotypia 28.4.93 et al. Kephallenia Survey. Dr Klavs Randsborg of Copenhagen University has been carrying out field work under the Swedish Institute in 1991-92. "This project is carried out in close collaboration with the Ephorate at Patras and with students of Copenhagen, Aarhus and Lund Universities-prehistorians, classical and medieval archaeologists alike. The purpose of the project is primarily to undertake an extensive investigation of settlement in a part of the Aegean core region (albeit relatively peripheral) with a stress on the periods LBA to the E Med. Of special interest is the development during the 1st Millenium BC, which is studied from a comparative European perspective, e.g. in connection with the rise of the city-state. On the island, the largest of the Ionian Islands, high mountains with pine-forests that yielded large timbers for ships until about 100 years ago, alternate with valleys and even small plains, which make up the four central agricultural areas of the lobed island. These four areas hold most of the Myc finds and later made up the cores of four city- states, Pale, Krane, Same and Pronnoi, all with natural bound- aries, covered in the cases of Same (and especially Proni) with small fortresses and easily controllable. The A development of the city-states must be viewed in the light of the expansion of Corinth. Devastating earthquakes are also known from earlier periods and are no doubt largely responsible for the poor state of preservation of the antique stone-architecture. Earthquakes like that of 1953 can destroy even field terraces and start substantial erosion, a fact which is of great importance for the evaluation of archaeological survey-data. Near the tholos tomb at Poros, excavated by the Greek service, the present team found an unknown A temple; the island has already at least three of these. The work of 1991-92 has been concentrated on detailed geographical and environmental studies. The concession comprises the entire E part of the island with the city-states of Same and Pronnoi; a series of extensive and intensive surveys on almost the entire area of the concession has been carried out, concentrating on the lands below the well fortified city of Same and on the entire territory of Pronnoi (including two centres, one a huge double fortress with a sanctuary and a settlement at Palaiokastro, the other the main city by the sea with e.g. a newly found cave with dedicated ECor fine-wares). The Myc finds are in the valleys and on the plains, where also (L)HL and R farmsteads and villas are recorded. The A-C settlement is concentrated around the fortified centres and on relatively highly placed localities; in later times the swampy valley behind Poros was feared for its malaria-another factor in the consideration of anc. patterns of settlement. Of special interest is a harbour-site at Kato Katelios (with a rare sandy beach-normally the mountains drop right into the sea). Here, for example, is an earthquake-stricken R villa with extremely well-preserved finds. The higher-lying areas (above the limits for agriculture, at ca. 600m) have probably been used to raise sheep and goats (highest grounds); even at these altitudes there are still small fortresses etc. from classical antiquity. A considerable part of the activities in 1992 were devoted to measuring, especially on the territory of Pronnoi, e.g. of the above-mentioned centres, a series of smaller fortresses, farmsteads and villas, anc. terrace-walls, and a LR/Byz cathedral on the isolated promontory at Phiskardo in the far N. As always dating is the salient point, and small supplemen- tary excavations will be needed. Although almost 200 frag- ments of bg fine-wares have been found (from the mid 1st millenium BC) an attempt will also be made to establish an independent chronology based on house-tiles-among other things to date the Med finds. A series of finds by the present team, of fragments of monumental stone architecture, grave- stones with inscriptions, etc. will no doubt prove very import- ant for the evaluation of the position of Kephallenia in anc. Greece. From the earlier periods should be noted a colossal Pal settlement at Phiskardo, most probably on a breeding-ground for seals, still common in the strait between Kephallenia and Ithaka. Another Pal settlement was found in the far S on the sandy beaches at Skala, where some of the last of the giant turtles of the Mediterranean (Caretta caretta) are still breeding, as they no doubt were in the Stone Age. On the same site an extensive N settlement was noted (with, for example, imported obsidian); Myc ceramics were also found. Local flint is recorded everywhere on the island; thus, the Stone Age settlement was no doubt much more extensive than previously assumed. From the Middle Ages and later periods come a large number of fortresses, often above the antique ones, churches (and monastic sites), villages, and even well-preserved earth- quake-stricken Venetian villas. The ethnological work has so far been relatively modest. In the landscape are still seen the destroyed villages of 1953-an ethno-archaeological Greece before modernity, with the informants still around! After 1953 the whole settlement was moved down to the corridors of transportation. Thus, Kephall- enia changed from an older settlement-system determined mainly by economic factors to a moder transport-orientated one. From the most recent times the impact of tourism and the superior role of the EEC is noted. In exchange for surrender of agricultural lands (in fact already given up), Brussels pays a 'goat-support' fee (the thousands of animals are rarely milked or eaten), that threatens to ruin the landscape. Phiskardo. Three rich unrobbed R tombs found by the telephone company are reported in Ethnos 24.3.93. Same. Eleven rescue excavations are reported for 1985 with material both of occupation levels and from the cemeteries. On Dichalion, in a plot on two levels, the lower produced R walls in both opus testacaeum and opus caementum. On the upper was a R terrace wall with C spolia and another terrace wall behind it (with contemporary W extension); here was C pottery of the end of the 5th Ct and beginning of the 4th Ct BC. A public building of the 2nd-3rd Cts AD was found in the Bangelatou plot (at the crossing of unnamed roads); it was L- shaped, probably a stoa, and had geometric mosaics; it was</page><page sequence="24">26 E.B. FRENCH destroyed by an earthquake with fire. The base for a bronze statue is inscribed with a dedication by the Boule and the Demos (text not given) related to an inscription previously published. Later usage of the area included an olive press; among the many finds were architectural fragments and a stele inscribed [A]AMOTIMOX. R building phases of the 3rd-4th Cts AD came to light on I. Metaxa. On Loutrou the R baths (2nd-3rd Ct AD) which had been known and fully visible until 1953 were partially excavated in two plots. In one was also a ECh building (5th/6th Ct AD) and between this and the baths there was a pottery kiln; finds included a small part of a marble statue and a series of architectural fragments in secondary usage, of which the most notable was an ECh column capital. On Naurinou there was further evidence for the R harbour installations which are in part still visible under- water came to light, giving information particularly about the sea level. Evidence of the cemeteries was found in four plots on I. Metaxa. In part of the C cemetery two walls of an enclosure and nine tombs (3 cists, 3 tile and 3 pit) came to light containing mainly pottery, but with a bronze mirror and a glass amulet. A HL 1-shaped tomb enclosure by the pebbled roadway containing 13 tombs (eight C and HL cists, mainly robbed, and five R built cists and tile graves) included a double R grave with five and 15 skeletons with copious offerings (50 pottery and glass vessels, bronze and bone artifacts) and covered by a inscribed stele in secondary use (photograph only, no text). Here too was a pyre of C or HL date (and the wall of a ?C building) and a number of stele bases and statue frag- ments. A R ChT (which had been known during WWII as the oven of Hadrian when used as a bakery) was investigated: it is 2.45m square with a tile roof, a bench, a statue base and a tile floor; nearby, to the N, were walls and a tomb enclosure including a tile cist grave. A two-storey tile grave of the 2nd Ct AD with part of a n-shaped enclosure was cleared; only the lower section was preserved with bones (among them much carbon and fine gravel) and 13 artifacts of glass, pottery, bronze and a lead pyxis. In the area of Ag. Spyridon (anc. Pale) an unfluted column accompanied by A, C and PR sherds in a sandy layer possibly indicates the presence of an unknown sanctuary." Tzannata. The excavation of a Myc tholos tomb is reported in To Paron 21.2.93. ELEIA (7th Ephorate) Accounts of the excavations and chance finds in this Ephorate by N. Kokotake and G.E.

The effects of the spring 1993 earthquakes at Pyrgos are described in Eleutheros 24.2.93 and Rizospastes 3.4.93; no major damage was done but the continued minor tremors may prove to have caused damage more serious than at first appears. ENA 14.4.93 publishes a long article on the area. Morea Project. The second season of the Minnesota Morea Project took place in August 1992 and is reported by Pro- fessors F.A. Cooper and J.D. Alchermes: "Methodology: The basic method was established in the 1991 season. Our Trimble Pathfinder GPS (Global Positioning System) was of limited use in 1992 due to the imposition of Selective Availability on many of the relevant satellites by the US Department of Defense. Selective Availability refers to the deliberate distortion of satellite signals, with the result that waypoints have a maximum deviation factor of +/- 300m rather than the +/- 2-5m that we achieved in 1991. We hope to rectify this problem in 1993 with the GPS Base Station, which, in combination with the mobile GPS unit, will correct adverse satellite signals and allow for even more precise mapping of villages and sites. In the absence of a functioning GPS system, villages recorded in 1992 were mapped using ropes colour- coded at 20m intervals; lengths and orientation of streets and paths were then plotted by means of computer graphics using AutoCad 11 software. This map of the village was then used by the drawing team to plot individual houses, assisted by colour-coded flagging and/or dots of paint throughout the village. Itinerary: As in 1991, selection of a village for recording was based first upon its inclusion in the Venetian censuses of 1689 and 1700, as compiled by V. Panaghiotopoulos in Plithysmos kai Oikismoi tis Peloponnesou (Athens, 1987). In any such village, we then required the existence of a minimum of 5-10 pre-beton houses before choosing it for recording. Information obtained from villagers also led to the discovery of sites and villages not gleaned from the censuses. In total, 19 villages were drawn, comprising over 500 houses and including an 18th Ct monastery and a Med town site. As in 1991, the town of Kakovatos was used as a training site before moving on, in the first week of the project, to villages in the area of Zacharo: Arini, Xirohori, Tripes/Chrysohori and Vresto; Milea and Menthi were bypassed due to the unavailability of their mayors, from whom permission to survey the town was needed. During the second week of the season the drawing team travelled to Arkadia to record Dhimitsana and Zatouna, while the mapping team explored other villages in the area. The third and final week was spent in mod. Achaia, where we mapped and drew villages in the foothills of Mount Erymanth- os: Ag. Marina, Kato Ag. Marina, Golemi, Kalentzi, Alepohori, Kryovrissi, Manesi, Spartia, Tsipiana, Velimahi, Xirohori, the monastery of Ag. Panton, and the site of Kastro Oreias. Ag. Kyriaki was omitted due to lack of cooperation on the part of the mayor. While in Achaia we took advantage of the facilities of the Stavrodromi schoolhouse, which were gra- ciously offered by the village mayor, Andrea Giannoulis. The following villages, which are listed in the Venetian censuses, were examined and eliminated as having too few (in some cases, no) surviving pre-beton houses: Roupakia, Fares, Issoma, Hekali, Skliva, Sinopoulo, Drosia, Skouras, Skiadas. Many of these villages are in fertile agricultural areas where concrete has completely replaced older stone construction. In general, the best preserved towns appear to be those mountain villages with limited access, such as Alepohori and Spartia, and towns such as Dhimitsana and Stamnitsa, where immigration to Athens and Patras, with its coincident increased level of education and income, has resulted in interior modernization of the houses while the exterior has been respected in terms of original design, fabric and construction. We anticipate record- ing the following villages, among others, in 1993: Visiki, Stamnitsa, Alonitsana, Viongas and the Turkish mill at Tourkoraptis, all in W Arkadia; Laganas, Anthounas, Kako- tari, Lambia, Kalyvia, the citadel of Ag. Triada and the area of the Peneios Reservoir lake, all in the Erymanthos region. We will also complete work begun this year at Kastro Oreias. Stamnitsa was bypassed this year because of the existence of N.K. Mousopoulos' study of the town (Stamnitsa-Ypsous, Thessaloniki, 1989). Examination of the book, however, has led to the decision to include the town in our 1993 season. While an excellent publication, with beautiful drawings, the book illustrates only six houses and the plateia; a complete survey of the town is still needed.</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 27 Preliminary Results: the fewer number of villages and houses canvassed this year as compared to 1991 is the result of three factors: the limited usefulness of the GPS for mapping purposes; a slightly smaller crew, due to circumstances beyond our control; and greater attention paid to the gathering of the information from villagers themselves. Intensive interviews were conducted by Mary Coulton, a native of Athens who has completed a Master's degree at Birmingham University on Greek marriage songs. She will continue work on the project during the winter of 1992/93, carrying out bibliographical research in Athens and England. A comparison of houses recorded in 1991 in villages of the Alpheios watershed and those drawn in 1992 in the area of the Peneios River has revealed a number of interesting regional variations in architectural detailing and construction. Many more datestones were found this year, and in the area of Mount Erymanthos inscribed and verbal evidence of Epirote stone- masons was discovered, whereas the villages surveyed further S in 1991 had a tradition of Langadian stonemasons. The Achaian villages exhibited a much more frequent use of stone slab roofs, (characteristic of Epirote vernacular architecture), often retaining the first course of slabs even when a modem tile roof was installed. Analysis of data collected this year will, it is hoped, enable us to further identify architectural signa- tures, such as was discovered in 1991 at Skilloundia. Careful inspection of construction techniques in this semi-abandoned village revealed a distinctive masonry detail in several houses: a segmented relieving arch with stone lintel, combined with orthostat quoining. While we could establish no firm date for these houses, analysis of our databank yielded similar detailing in two other villages, Langadia and Moutzaki, with dates of 1847 and 1871 respectively, thus providing a date of ca. 1850- 1870 for this set of Skilloundia houses. In addition to the survey of villages, the 1992 season included the recording of the monastery of Ag. Panton near Erymanthia, now solely occupied by Abbot Savas. The monastery, founded in 1715 and possessing a datestone of 1766 in its upper chapel, originally had cells for 40 monks. While some renovation and rebuilding has taken place, most of the building complex is in its original state. Two architecturally- trained crew members led the team in creating measured drawings of the interior spaces, especially noting architectural details such as column capitals, datestones and arching. Exterior walls were also drawn and photographed, and the iconographic schemes of wall paintings in the three chapels were noted. Frankish Citadels: As in 1991, the 1992 Morea Project had the dual goal of examining Frankish domestic sites as well as more recent vernacular architecture. Two such settlements were discovered this year, in the area at the SW end of the Eryman- thos ridge; the citadel of Ag. Triada and Kastro Oreias, near Kakotari. The Ag. Triada peak was explored briefly, and will be returned to next year. Frankish fortification walls, built into earlier walls of HL date, have a circumference of ca. 300m. Other extant architectural remains include a massive rubble and mortar construction, which was probably a keep, and Frankish rooftiles. Evidence for C occupation survives in HL towers and footings for walls, a marble Doric frieze block adjacent to the remains of a non-peripteral temple, and fragments of weathered marble along the slopes. The recording of the Frankish remains at the site is scheduled for our 1993 season. Kastro Oreias, N of Kakotari, rises above the gorge of the upper Peneios River, and like the citadel at Ag. Triada is currently uncharted. The site is now desolate, occupied only by sheep and goats and a single shepherd and his family. Accord- ing to this shepherd, Christos Vasilopoulos, whose knowledge of the site is impressive, the remains include 240 houses, three churches, a nekrotapheion, three springs, 16 mills along the river, including remains of races, and a bridge of the Turko- kratia period. We discovered at least two areas with extensive remains of iron slag, which along with the mills (used, according to our informant, for grain and fulling, among other things), indicate that this was an industrial settlement. The discovery of a few Frankish rooftiles provides evidence of the date of the site; homogeneous construction techniques indicate that it is of a single period. Stretches of rubble and mortar fortification walls survive; mortar also occurs in a vaulted cistern and on the citadel. Retaining walls for roads remain in situ, along with stretches of well-laid kalderini. The houses of the town appear to have been tower houses for the most part: a few have extant landing for three storeys, thus providing evidence for three- to four-storey buildings. The plans take one of two sizes: some are nearly square (3.5-4.5 x 5.5-6.5m), while others are rectangular (6 x 12m). Doorways to the lowermost floor level frequently survive, and are always on the flank of the building; visible thresholds indicate that the floor of the apotheke was sunken by some 30-60cms, necessi- tating a step down from the exterior ground level. There is no sign of mortar in the houses: stone was quarried from the hill itself, often adjacent to the house. Walls are roughly coursed, with massive quoining at the comers: quoin blocks span the thickness of the wall, and even larger stones were used as stretchers. Facade walls average ca. 90cm in width, while side walls are ca. 60cm wide. Houses are concentrated on the steep SE slope of the hill, above the quarries and in sight of the mills along the river, further evidence of the industrial nature of the town. They consistently face outward, down the slope, built in a radial pattern around the hill. In addition to architectural remains we noted pottery on the hill and cist graves lined with stone slabs in the nekrotapheion at its base. Human bones lie exposed and a certain amount of looting has clearly taken place, although the apparent lack of grave goods has kept this activity at a lower level than would otherwise be the case." Ag. Triada. The find of a Myc cemetery is reported by the Ephorate in Eleutheros 7.8.92. Alepochori (10km NE of Pyrgos). A new site was identified by the find of a Myc cist tomb and later a ChT with keyhole dromos, side chamber and broad facade. Here the main burial had been looted in antiquity though there was a skeleton on the floor. The contents of three cists were much disturbed with all the pottery smashed (LH IIIA2-B including two rhyta). A fig- urine from one of the cists is illustrated and is probably earlier than the suggested 'transitional' group. Of particular import- ance is the amount of gold and glass jewellery and ornament, previously not widely found in this area. (ADelt 40 Chr, 103) Alpheiousa (Bolantza).

An LH monochrome cup (LH IIIA-B) was handed in to the authorities. (ADelt 41 Chr, 43) Olympia. The German Institute report on their work in 1992 on the research project 'Olympia during the R Imperial Period': After ending the investigation of the R installation N of the Prytaneion, work concentrated on a R building in the SW area of the site (Fig. 18). Its brick masonry, preserved to ca. 5m high, was never totally covered by earth. The visible remains seem to belong to three large rooms with barrel-vaulted ceilings, which led to their interpretation as a bath (the SW baths). Its closeness to the Leonidaion which lies a little further N suggested that it was an annex to the banqueting hall and hospice. Excavations this year have brought new evidence concerning the topography in this part of the sanctuary, which puts the SW building and its relation to the Leonidaion in a new light: total excavation has shown that the main entrance of the Leonidaion lies on the S side, i.e. turned away from the centre of the sanctuary. This led to the justifiable conclusion that the position of the entrance was related to the course of the Ceremonial Way which enters the sanctuary from the SW. The exact course of this road and its point of entry into the sanctuary remained, however, unknown. New evidence has come from this year's excavation. It is now known that the main entrance for the SW building lay on its N side. The doorway had a width of nearly 3m and was situated exactly on the middle axis of the courtyard, thus giving an impressive view of the once marble-clad facade, with its three statue niches, from the entrance. About 3m N of the E doorjamb the lower part of a column in situ has been cleared. Judging by the existing foundations, the column belonged to a long portico in front of the entrance. The SW building which lies obliquely opposite the Leonidaion was clearly also orientated on the Cer- emonial Way (Fig. 19). The position of the Ceremonial Way between the Leonidaion and the SW building is corroborated by traces of its HL predecessor; in several deep soundings the old surface was found, with over 20 HL coins trodden into it. If this evidence is taken seriously, there are certain conse- quences for the topography of Olympia in general and the interpretation of our building in particular, as it most probably lay in the immediate vicinity of the main entrance to the sanctuary. An old hypothesis suggested that the embankment wall of the Kladeos formed the W limit of the sanctuary. This wall is still visible in several places, particularly in the area of the mod. Kladeos bridge. Its S course cannot yet be determined exactly, but there are indications that the embankment wall (= sanctuary wall) ran ca. 20-30m W of our building situated on the Ceremonial Way. To the best of our knowledge the main sanctuary entrance must be sought where the Ceremonial Way crossed the embankment and the river, either by ford or bridge. The SW building, hitherto thought to lie at the edge of the sanctuary, suddenly finds itself in a prominent position and can no longer be interpreted as an annex to the Leonidaion; it was an autonomous installation. This gives new importance to the question of its function. After previous excavations, objections had already been raised against the old interpretation as a bath, because the groundplan recovered so far has no parallel in the known typology of baths. This year another element has been added to its unique groundplan and fittings. E of the main building parts of an annex belonging to the original structure were cleared by Georg Ladstatter (Fig. 20). Here, too, sherds found close to the foundations point to a building date in the late 1st Ct AD. The brick courses of the annex are bonded into the masonry of the main structure. The function of this room, which stands to a height of ca. 2m, is still unknown, but on its E side there is a 3m deep basin, only 80cm wide, which also belongs to the original structure. Three existing water conduits would have filled the basin with fresh water in a short time. Shape and position do not suggest storage of bath water; it is more likely that the water was used for drinking or in the preparation of food. This is corroborated by the numerous</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 29 FIG. 19 pieces of kitchen pottery found on the bottom. The pottery is homogeneous and uniformly dated to the middle of the 2nd Ct AD (dating by Christa Schauer). At that time the basin went out of use and was filled in, which coincided with the first use of the water conduit of Herodes Atticus. There is possibly a connection between the two events. Total clearance of the three rooms in the main building is expected to give definite information about its purpose. Excavation of the W hall started this year. At the end of this year's campaign half of the Med layers of river sand had been removed. Parallel with the clearance of these well- preserved remains, conservation of the tops of walls continued. The employment and instruction of some local workmen last year has proved very successful. Three workmen are now employed all the year round to protect the R masonry.

For the greater part of the season efforts were concentrated on the trial trench, taking it down to depths of between 1.0-2.3m. The purpose of this was to establish the vessel's method of construction. When it became clear that we were not going to be able to answer these questions in the time remaining, the focus of attention was moved to the inside of the hull, where a new trench was opened, which was, in effect, a continuation of the trial trench. An area dense with badly broken pottery and wood was revealed. Because of the badly fragmented nature of the pottery, as well as other evidence of great violence, it was evident that we were working at the epicentre of the 1980 bomb explosion which had resulted in the discovery of the wreck. Other finds included stone cannon balls, beads and many hundreds of hazel nuts, the latter in an excellent state of preservation. Of particular interest was a small hoard of coins in one small area beside the frame timbers. As with the single coin from the 1991 season, these were also badly concreted, but it is hoped nonetheless that it may be possible to extract enough information from these to obtain a working chronology for the vessel."

(ADelt 41 Chr, 48) A short feature on the antiquities of the island is published by Anti 13.11.92. In 1992 a further season of cooperative work on the wreck off the port of Zakynthos (AR 1991-92 25-26) was carried out by an international team under K. Delaporta of the Underwater Ephorate and M. Bound of MARE (Oxford University). "A small tugboat and all the heavy equipment were very generously provided by the Greek Ephorate. The unexploded aerial bomb from WWII that had brought work to a halt the season before had been made safe by the Greek navy, enabling work to commence where it had left off in 1991, that is to say in the trial trench on the outboard side of the ship's hull. The team was divided into two parts: those under Mensun Bound, who concentrated on the mapping and interpretation of the timbers, and those under Katerina Delaporta, who concentrated on the excavation of the trenches and the care and removal of Kallithea: Zakale. A R kiln partially destroyed by the landowner is reported. (ADelt 40 Chr, 107) Kaplani: Vigla (AR 1991-92, 26).

Themelis has published the detailed report of his work in 1989 in PAE, 63-112, and lectured in two venues in Athens during the winter 1992/93 on the progress of his excavations and their relation to Pausanias' description of the site. In 1992 he continued his work on the site (Ergon, 27-41) clearing the greater part of the W and N sides of the stoa. Many of the Doric columns are in situ and other architectural members scattered around; the stoas clearly belong to the gymnasium of the city and the W stoa is the Olympike and the N the Mese. Inscriptions from this area are noted: Oi fO1rlEr uvot ion6 ®()oo6v[Eo;] /Kp6tcovoa ®cooo(v£eo /TOv aotciv eDepytTav 6xpeCTa /IEVeKcV Kcai eDvoiat /tc;S £is actToD; and 'A n6t; too;s azT&amp;; £e£pepyTat[s] /[--]av 'AgDVTOa vacat 'A,gvToav i4tX(o[voS] /vacat /Arljtlp pto itXcovos 'AOrlvoatoS; notril v.

Immediately behind columns 5 to 8 is a gateway flanked by two unfluted columns leading to the temenos of Herakles from which some large architectural members were found nearby. Particularly notable is the 3rd Ct base of a Herm of Herakles inscribed: iDtkXt&amp;aq /N£ovoS /'HpaKX[et] i/av£0r[K£]. Other notable inscriptions are three lists of gymnasiarchs and ephebes, similar to others known but which can be dated exactly to 4, 9 and 11 AD. Fragments of large monuments can be related to things drawn by the French for their original record of the site. A short way NW of the W stoa a rectangular peristyle (40m square) with a small temple or monument in the middle was cleared; this can be identified as the palaistra. Immediately W of the Temple of Orthia is a rectangular structure 24 x 24m in good condition with a 4th/3rd Ct shrine inside. Below the floor lay a deposit of masses of dedicatory plaques and figurines, pots and animal bones. The scenes are of funerary banquets, horses, women, warriors, one head in a helmet, but the most important is a handmade figurine depicting two women on a throne holding a third figure (comparable with A pieces known from Arkadia). This suggests that the shrine is dedicated to Demeter. The votives date from the 7th to the 2nd Ct BC. N of the shrine a monumental base was found for a series of bronze statues and a marble group from which fragmentary horses' legs came to light. It bears the inscription: 'EmX'ap- rlV rooXwcKXo[]/ l / xc n6t; av£0rlK£. Nike 6.12.92 describes the Messene Museum in its series on the Museums of Greece. Bema 28.2.93 features the site. Methone.

The collection in 1985 (following construction work) of MH and LH pottery and EH mortars made the excavation of this site necessary and tests were carried out in 1986. An MH tomb was found, and earlier walling, giving confirmation that this site is an important PR settlement. (ADelt 40 Chr, 107, ADelt 41 Chr, 41-2) Psari Triphylias: Metsiki (AR 1991-92, 27). The fourth and final season of work on Tholos 1 is reported (ADelt 40 Chr, 103-6) followed by a season of post-excavation work and a start on Tholos 2 (EMyc pottery) (ADelt 41 Chr, 42). In 1985 the blocking wall of the doorway was cleaned, recorded and removed. It proved to be a double wall. During conservation of the doorway tests were made by deposit Al and on the building to the N, in both of which Myc pottery was found. The excavation of the last of the tholos deposit produced more Myc painted and unpainted pottery, clay conuli, a shaft (?) of flint, bone pins, obsidian and flint blades and arrow heads. The quantity of flint suggests a local workshop. Later finds from disturbance include pyramidal loomweights, bg and rf pottery, and a coin of Histaia. FIG. 21 Pylos. A press report that the PG tholos has been bulldozed appeared in Eleutherotvpia 12.6.92. The Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP) completed its first season of surface survey in the summer of 1992 under the auspices of the ASCS. Professor Jack Davis, the overall director, reports: "The goal of PRAP is to document systematically remains of past activity within a 250km2 area of SW Messenia centred on the Palace of Nestor. One main objective is to reconstruct and interpret PR changes in settlement patterns and land use in the region before the palace emerged, during its operation as a centre, and after its decline. A second major objective is to reconstruct patterns of settlement in the historical periods, before, during, and after Spartan domination of Messenia. The area offers excellent opportunities for the integration of historical and archaeological evidence. Archaeological fieldwork over the six-week season took two forms. First, intensive survey of ca. 12km2 provided detailed information about the surface distribution of artifacts over the entire Englianos ridge, including the immediate area of the Palace of Nestor, and of a sizable area beyond the probable BA boundary between the Hither and Further Provinces of the Pylian state. Significant new information was gathered about the extent of settlement around the Palace: the distribution of PR surface finds covers some 20-30 ha. Eighteen other sites (including several PR and historical cemeteries) were exam- ined; finds of the M to LBA, A to HL periods, and of the R, Byz, and Mod. eras were collected. In addition, a fourth 'Inventory' team initiated a systematic program of restudy at known archaeological sites with a view to defining more clearly their extents and periods of occupa- tion. Among these, targets of special investigation were Koryfasion: Beylerbey (UME 4), a large PR site and historical sites near the Osmanaga Tholos, and Romanou, a large A to R town more than lkm2 in extent. At Beylerbey finds included a well-preserved Myc lentoid seal with a representation of a goat (Figs. 21, 22).</page><page sequence="30">32 E.B. FRENCH FIG. 22 Other archaeological research supported by PRAP included the extraction for palynological analysis of several cores over 4m long from Osmanaga Lagoon. Geoarchaeological survey suggests that the silt and marl surfaces that cover much of the 250km2 area have been subjected to severe erosion. Analysis of aerial photographs and of microtopography provided new evidence in support of Kraft's theory that the river N of the Palace has been artificially diverted; it may, indeed, have led to an inland port basin, now infilled, N of Romanou. Other research sponsored by PRAP included the study for publication by Cynthia Shelmerdine and John Bennet of two chance finds of Linear B material now in the Chora Museum: a tablet fragment (Chora mus. no.3850; Fig. 23), found in 1992 by MARWP at the Palace of Nestor in the course of architectural studies, and a nodule (Chora mus. no.3539; Fig. 24), an earlier surface find at the Palace. Finally, all field data collected by PRAP will be stored and analyzed with a Geographical Information System now being installed at the University of Michigan under the direction of Susan Alcock." The third season of the Minnesota Pylos Project (AR 1991- 92 27-28) took place in 1992 and is reported by Professors F.A. Cooper and M.C. Nelson: "The season was devoted to the clearing of rooms 89 and 90 on the W side of the palace, excavated by Carl Blegen in 1939, 1952, 1953 and 1956; and area 103, excavated by Marion Rawson in 1958, to the E and S of the wine magazine. Microfilm copies of the field notebooks for these areas, as well as photocopies of Blegen's photographs and his working MSS of the final publication, enabled us to reconstruct the original excavations to an extent not allowed when relying only on published excavation reports. As in 1991, our purpose was to clear the area of backfill in order to create a state plan of the walls; earth was removed down to the lowest course of stone or to the level reached by the original excavators. For reasons FIG. 23 FIG. 24</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 33 outlined below, the decision was made to clear floors as well as walls; nevertheless, the presence of Blegen's backfill still defined in every case the extent of our own cleaning oper- ations. Methodology: We began the season by re-establishing and extending the grid introduced in 1991: a N-S/E-W system of 5 x 5m trenches based on UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates. The establishment of such a grid enabled us to locate with plumb-bob accuracy the trenches opened in 1991, and will allow future scholars the same precision. Backfill was removed according to trench, with field notes kept on customized locus sheets. These sheets ensured, among other things, the systematic recording of top and bottom elevations; soil colour and matrix (which must approximate the original soil excavated by Blegen); presence of artifacts; photographs; interpretative notes. Detailed trench plans were drawn on sheets of mm grid paper and complemented the final state plan of the season's work. As in 1991, each wall and trench was photo- graphed before and after excavation. This year, however, photographs were made in both black and white and colour, and the use of a bi-pod provided us with aerial photographs of each trench. For the reasons given in our 1991 report, we continued to sift all removed fill. This resifting of approximate- ly 30m3 of Blegen's excavated earth from a total of 20 trenches resulted in the recovery of several fragments of Linear B tablets, pottery of non-palace period date (e.g. MH and G), and hundreds of small fresco fragments which Blegen did not collect. Preliminary Results: As mentioned above, our procedure in 1991 involved clearing only the tops and elevations of walls. Blegen reported only simple dirt floors in the NE Workshop and the area immediately to its N, and we made no attempt to remove this fill. A test clearing made in 1991 in area 92/94, however, revealed a handsome flagstone floor, and the area 102 ramp appears to contain a maze of walls and levels much more intricate than Blegen indicated. Clearing of these areas was postponed from 1991. This year, as work moved N toward the wine magazine, the unexpected occurred. Removal of the backfill in area 103 revealed extensively plastered floors unnoted by Blegen, though Rawson's field notebooks provide some indication of their presence. The wall fresco fragments noted below were recovered from the backfill Blegen laid above these floors. This area also contains a clear sequence of walls and floors from prepalatial through postpalatial times; Blegen appears to have paid scant attention to these, either in his working MSS or in the final publication of the site. The following relative chronology is tentative, and will be further clarified in 1993. Phase 1: ?MH wall. In 1958 David French sunk a 1.8m sondage within Rawson's trench Z10. With sketches from Rawson's original field notebooks and using our coordinate system, we were able to compute the position of this irregular trench and locate the sondage within our trench 139.788. We removed the backfill to uncover a massive wall running beneath the wine magazine vestibule (room 104), with exposed length of im, and a minimum width of 1.45m. Approximately 70cm towards the SE, with elevations from 191.75 to 192.45m stands a staircase made of stones and cut stereo, spiralling upwards for some 1.2m in a counterclockwise direction. French records a handful of sherds of MH date from the sondage. Phase 2: Prepalatial portico. The evidence for this phase consists of a pair of column bases and a plaster floor with painted design. The column bases are set 3.5m apart and are aligned E-W, at a 45% angle to the overall axes of the palace and wine magazine. Blegen recognized the W base but not the E one, which is still one-half preserved and forms an obvious respond to the W base. The stucco floor abuts both column bases and here and there in its preserved expanse still retains traces of painted lines and related patterns. This floor is cut into by the walls of a later period, Phase 3. The columns and related floor appear to be the remains of a large pillared hall, with minimum N-S width of 7m. Phase 3: walls, Z3, Z21, Z22, Z14, Z26, Z28. These walls zig-zag at right angles to each other to form a megaron-like plan. They cut into the decorated plaster floor of Phase 2, and follow a distinctly different orientation and axis from that of the previous phase. The walls along the NW flank of this building were cut away by the foundation trench for the wine magazine. It was probably at this time that blocks from the other walls were robbed. Phase 4: SE house (walls Z25 and Z26). Only a corer of this house was excavated by Blegen; its orientation runs at an oblique angle to the alignment of the 'zig-zag megaron' of Phase 3. Phase 5: plaster fragment floor. This floor, made of a terrazzo-like mosaic of broken plaster fragments, was built up against the walls of the 'zig-zag megaron' and the SE House. The frescoed wall from which the fragments must have come logically dates before Phase 4 and probably before Phase 3, and may well relate to the Prepalatial Portico of Phase 2. The fresco fragments recovered from the fill above this floor are discussed below. Phase 6: Wine Magazine. The wine magazine was exca- vated by David French and published in detail by Blegen; it will be cleared and drawn in 1993. This building cuts through the walls of Phase 3, and is dated by sealings found in it to LH IIIB; Phases 1-5 must therefore date to an earlier period. Phase 7: Postpalatial walls. Evidence for postpalatial occupation of this area of the site comes from the walls of building 103a-d, found in Rawson's trenches MZ1 through MZ11 (our trenches 130.805, 135.805 and 135.800); and from walls immediately NE of the wine magazine in Rawson trenches MZ24 through MZ50 (our trenches 130.805, 135.800 through 150.800, 140.805). The foundations of these walls are built over an earth deposition approximately 10-20cm thick. The deposit has a consistent top elevation of 191.90 to 191.95m (sloping downwards from N to S), and lies upon the demolished tops of earlier walls with elevations of 191.66 to 191.74m. It should be noted here that the bottom of wall Z20 (here interpreted as Phase 7, or of G date) is separated from the top of Z21 (here associated with the 'zig-zag megaron' of Phase 3). Rawson recovered an iron blade from the NW end of wall Z16, and an iron nail from the S end of wall Z10 (the W wall of room 103c). These iron objects, omitted from Blegen's catalogue of finds from this area (PN I, 340-41), strongly suggest an IA or later date for these buildings. As mentioned, Blegen appears to have had little interest in the maze of prepalatial walls in area 103, though he does note briefly their presence: "Too little has survived of these houses antedating the wine magazine to give an adequate idea of the general plan and character of the prepalatial settlement in this quarter or to fix its date exactly" (PN I, 336-37). He was even less concerned with evidence for a possible postpalatial occupation of the palace. Nevertheless, despite his belief that the Ano Engliano acropolis was destroyed late in LH IIIB and abandoned, scraps of evidence published in the Palace of Nestor volumes have led several scholars, notably M. Popham (OJA 10(3) 1991, 315-24) and C. Griebel (Abstracts of the Annual Meetings of the MidW Art History Society, Lincoln, April 1991), to argue for a reoccupation of the site.</page><page sequence="32">34 E.B. FRENCH As a result of this growing dissent, we decided to clear for study and drawing rooms 89 and 90, an area where Blegen did record the presence of iron artifacts, G pottery and scrappy walls built of reused material (PN I, 294-98). He argued that these rooms served as an olive press, and interpreted as a firebox what must have been a hearth. Blegen recognized two different phases in rooms 89-90, but did not reconcile this fact with the olive press function. In all probability these rooms comprise a modest house which was expanded and remodelled in the G period. Room 89, a 5m2 house, appears to have been the first construction: blocks taken from the palace were reused in the NW, NE and SE walls, with a stretch of palace wall used for the fourth side of the room. The entrance was at the N corer. Later, room 90 doubled the size of the house by extending the NW and SE walls to the flank wall of the palace. In a remodelling of the combined house 89-90, the door which originally opened into room 90 from room 89 was blocked, the dividing wall demolished, a flagged floor of rough, flat stones laid in room 90, and a new door opened at the SE corer, as indicated by a threshold block. Blegen made several observa- tions concerning phases of construction in this area during the prepalatial and palace periods. In tests made in room 88 where the destroyed plaster floor permitted, Blegen found an earlier plaster floor some 25cm below the later paving. Our clearing of a 50 x 50cm pit excavated by Blegen immediately NW of room 90 revealed evidence of this earlier floor. A ramp of plaster paving underlies the area of room 89; an anta wall flanked the NE side of what appears to have been an open vestibule and extended 6m to the NW, at which point it returned at a right angle to the NE, forming two sides of an enclosed room which probably opened to the SE. The palace period plaster floor of room 89 abuts both the anta wall and this wall return. Some time before the construction of the G house, room 89, the wall return was demolished and the 50cm square pit mentioned above was sunk into its NW stretch. Fresco Fragments: As mentioned above, a layer of fresco chips forms a pavement which runs within the corridor-like arrangement of walls to the NE of the wine magazine. The floor also extends SW into a small courtyard between Raw- son's walls Z21 and Z25. This pavement abuts walls Z3, Z21, Z25, and Z26, but not walls Z14 and Z22; it appears to run beneath wall Z20. The flooring is composed of at least two layers of wall fresco chips, ranging in surface area and depth from ca. .5 to 5cm square. For the most part, the painted surfaces lie face downwards, suggesting a collapsed frescoed wall, later serving as a pavement. Blegen's backfill into these trenches consists of high concentrations of this painted plaster; further conservation and study will take place in future seasons. The fragments appear to have come from a wall decorated with geometric patterns, including terracotta-coloured spirals on an ochre background, and red and white stripes; there is some indication of floral designs, and perhaps also some miniature figures. Linear B Tablets: Several small pieces of fired clay were identified as probable Linear B tablets, although they bore no writing. One square fragment, 2 x 1.5cm in size, carried a single character. It was discovered in Blegen's backfill against wall Z10 in our trench 130.800. Soil Samples: Over 20 of the 55 soil samples taken in 1991 were tested using a technique refined some ten years ago by soil scientists and geochemists: Inductively Coupled Plarma (ICP). This technique analyses quantities and percentages of 20 different elements, principally the heavy metals. The applica- tion of ICP to provenance studies is still experimental, but preliminary results are quite promising. The mud mortars taken from the various wall constructions in 1991 contain high percentages of calcium carbonate, a good indication that slaked limestone (asvesti) was mixed with soil to make a grout, thereby dramatically increasing the strength of the mortar. Preliminary results also indicate that percentages of certain elements are consistent in single stretches of wall, but vary among the different buildings sampled. Soil samples taken this year will also be subjected to ICP analysis, in what appears to be a promising test for the distinction of relative building periods of Myc date at Ano Engliano. Topographic Survey: A cooperative venture with the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project, led by J. Davis, occupied our afternoon hours after the close of fieldwork at the palace. Progress was made toward the completion of our own topo- graphical survey, however: several olive groves which immedi- ately surround the acropolis were mapped, and traverse points were re-fixed in preparation for continued research along the Ano Engliano ridge in 1993."

Portable finds included a bronze handle with dolphins and a plastic clay handle as well as coins of the 3rd and 4th Cts AD. Elsewhere, in part of the R necropolis, the remains of an osteotheke and five tombs were found, two of which were opened into the interior wall of a funerary chapel.

ECh and Byz finds were encountered on Oidipodos, and a fine collection of mostly glazed Byz pottery came from the junction of Aphrodites and Ekates, in conjunc- tion with coins of 1070-5, and 1143-80.

J-M Luce of the French School reports on his work in 1992 in the area of the Chariot of the Rhodians (AR 1991-92, 31), where work in 1992 concentrated on the G House, now known as the Yellow House from the colour of its floor, and on a third House below destroyed by fire, the Black House: One of the most striking features is the change of axis between the G buildings and the Red House (the name now given to that destroyed between 585 and 575 BC). This later axis is that of the peribolos and most of the monuments on the site, while the earlier lies NE/SW. In the Yellow House a relatively complex plan emerges. Two large rooms each open onto a narrow room at the S and a corridor leads from the S to the E room. The house is built on an artificial terrace over the remains of the earlier building (the Black House, built on virgin soil) and fills. Wall 11 at the S of the excavation was built with the double purpose of holding up the earth of the terrace and as an exterior wall. We must presumably imagine steps to allow access from the corridor of the house to the level of the lower terrace. There were at least two phases, since the dividing wall between rooms 1 and 3 was built on top of the first floor and is thus later. Room 2 had a hearth (noted in 1990) in the middle. The floor is of fine yellow clay, as often at Delphi, and was relaid several times. These layers were lifted one by one. One was not of clay but of plaster and can be clearly seen in the section. These layers slope down perceptibly to the W and even break off in some places before resuming 10cm or so lower. The material found on the lowest floor dates to the last quarter of the 8th Ct BC, notably a skyphos of the Thapsos class, where the painter has attempted a type of polychrome decoration, underlining the red lines in black. The Black House is preserved to the highest level even though less visible because later remains partially conceal it. It consists of at least two parallel rooms which do not connect, backed against a heavy retaining wall (reused and raised by the Yellow House). The W one of these was later divided by an interior wall of mud-brick on a stone foundation. This wall, on which the very fine white plastering is preserved in places had a window. Although the lower part of the walls (often pre- served to more than 1.30m) are of stone, the upper part was usually of mud-brick as is clear from the destruction debris. There may have been an upper storey, at least in the first phase. Though it was possible to recover materials in only a limited way, because of the restricted nature of the excavation, it is possible to distinguish a difference in function among the rooms: rooms 2 and 3 contained storage vessels (Fig. 25) whereas on the various floors in room 1 on the W were table and cooking wares (Fig. 26). This building suffered several destructions and its stratigraphic record shows alternation of floors generally rich in pottery with destruction levels. The first of these was caused by a fire in about the middle of the 8th Ct BC. This burnt level had also been found in 1991 in the sector E of the peribolos. The fire had been sufficiently violent to bake the fallen bricks right through. We know that other burnt levels of the same width and approximate date have been found by other exca- vators (the French, who thought it associated with debris from the altar, and the Germans). More recently L. Lerat uncovered a house datable to the middle of the 8th Ct BC which also had been destroyed by a violent fire (BCH 85 (1961) 338-52), and he describes very similar phenomena. It seems likely, though it cannot be proved, that a single fire destroyed a whole section of the village at this time. The builders of the Black House had cut the slope down to virgin soil and built a large retaining wall to hold the soil of an upper terrace which had not been cut. This would seem to be the explanation of the break in the stratigraphy between the two terraces. The traces of fire which are seen on the lower terrace appear some 2.30m higher, in a destruction level resting on a yellow clay floor. Below this we excavated a series of floors, destruction levels and fills belonging to the 9th Ct BC. A small circular hearth (Fig. 27) full of ash, bone fragments, grain and olive stones appears to date to the end of the 10th Ct BC and gives evidence, if the date is confirmed, of occupation of this period at Delphi. These PG levels rested directly on Myc levels of the end of the 13th or beginning of the 12th Ct BC. R Agora and SE Villa. V. Deroche and P. Petrides report on their work in 1992 for the French School. Three tests were opened in the area of the R agora.

The identification of a small coin as a probable Antoninianus, which was found almost at the base of these levels, confirms the dating. Behind the wall, about 1.20m E of the agora, a structure with dry stone steps was found; its function is as yet unclear though possibly it was a stair. A second trial in the NE inside corer of the agora was extended some 2m S but encountered only excavation debris or moder fills except at two points: at a R water channel in terracotta running N-S parallel with the stylobate and beneath it the intact foundation trench of the stylobate; and at the S extension of the return of the 'oblique wall' but without dating evidence; this wall was broken at the S by a S-N wall of the 'cloisonne' phase related to a doorway to the E blocked in a third phase. Excavation did not reach virgin soil nor the lowest point of the foundations of the stylobate or the 'oblique wall'. The third trial removed the fill of the walled shop next to the E niche of the agora except for a baulk holding the blocking wall at the S. The material confirmed the 1991 conclusions. Below the fill occupation and abandonment levels were found; the reason for the latter is still uncertain. The following may be noted: at the lowest level of the shop on virgin soil (ca. 30cm above the stylobate) was found a circular structure in rough red and yellow clay which must be the floor of a levelled glass furnace, surrounded by a mass of gravel rich in fragments of glass, wasters and slag; at the NE angle an amphora buried in the soil rested against this heap and a depression further E must represent another amphora with its base 10cm above the level of the stylobate; this level coincides with a lifting of the white plaster from the face of the W wall in its first phase. Above this level was a black layer relatively rich in finds; above that, a fine layer of almost pure burnt material (presumably from the clearing out of the kiln) and a layer of whitish raw clay; these form a floor and seem to correspond with the floor level associated with the W wall in its second phase and the foundation level of the E wall. Above this floor, broken both at the S and N by unaccounted disturb- ance (possibly the construction of the S blocking wall) was a new layer of burnt material and earth quite distinct from the later major fill and enclosed on the W by a strange deposit of natural mud without archaeological material which seems to have been poured over the W wall before the infill. An initial use of the area as a workshop is thus clear, followed in its turn by a second occupation level (white floor) which must be intended to reflect the walls of the cloisonne period, followed by an abandonment (mud level) and finally a general infill enclosed by the S blocking wall. The absolute chronology is however less clear and awaits the study of the coins; the complex should be placed between the major infill (4th Ct AD) and the N wall which must go with the 'oblique wall' to the E (High Empire). The burnt layer above could belong to a fire, since it is known that the marble colonnade of the agora suffered more than one. In the SE Villa (formerly the S baths) the room S of the cistern containing a tomb was cleared. The lime-covered floor discovered in 1991 became much more clear and allowed an occupation level to be defined, that of the R house of the 5th Ct AD; below the floor the N wall and the S part of the E and W walls have no foundations; above it is the deposit of late everyday pottery found in 1991. This floor abuts the edge of the tomb (the gap noted in 1991 between the floor and the tomb was only the result of a slight deterioration of the floor); the perfect linkage to the brick kerb of the tomb makes one wonder whether the tomb is not a late re-use of something with a different function (perhaps a basin). At the SW angle there was found a Gr wall at an angle oblique to the walls of the R villa and running cleanly beneath the floor level of the villa. Associated with it are doubtless the two E-W unmortared walls already noted further N and a floor level of small stones and beaten earth some 15-20cm below the lime floor resting on the savoura towards the NE, which remained intact. This forms a Gr habitation level, for the layer between this floor and the R floor produced many Gr sherds, a bronze spearhead and lumps of purple or yellow crude brick; the latter must come from the destruction of mud-brick walls of the Gr house which rested on the dry stone walls which remain. At the W end of the building the excavation was undertaken of a 2m stretch of the E end of Decauville's baulk, which blocked an apsidal room already known from the Great Excavation (see the 1897 Plan of Touraire, plan E in the Atlas). This appears to correspond to that cleared in 1961 but of different construction. The room was cleared of the accumu- lated debris. Thanks to the collapse of the R walls of the apse the strata could be observed and the area proved rich in discoveries. The floor level, already reached in 1986, was cleared and its continuation S beneath the Decauville baulk confirmed. At the N end of the baulk a pottery kiln had been built against the E wall of the apse; its lowest level was well preserved, including some wasters and other material. This kiln will be datable by coins, three large folles probably of Mid Byz date, and illustrates both the decline in habitation and the Mid Byz reoccupation of the site. The kiln was filled with mud without finds, indicating a period of abandonment before the final collapse of the R walls. A complex of walls immediately S of the kiln will be further investigated next season.

Here the building which covers the mosaics rests on the anc. walls themselves (Fig. 28). Explanation panels give guidance to the visitor and a guide book with colour illustrations in four languages has been prepared. The work of conserving the mosaics and building the protective structure has been financed by the generosity of M. and Mme Hellmut Baumann. Two excavations also took place in 1991: K. Reber carried out a fourth season of exploration in the houses of the W quarter. The latest complex N of building II belongs to building IV (Fig. 29). The character of the workshop activities already known from this building has not yet been defined but the building phases were clarified. In the 8th Ct BC the pits which had doubtless been dug for the extraction of clay were infilled, and in the fill a great deal of G pottery of excellent quality was found. The area seems to have remained open till ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 39 the end of the 4th Ct, when a rectangular building was built, aligned with the roadway which runs from the W gate to the S of the town. Some decades later additions to the structure housed the workshops. The whole area became impoverished in the HL period and the last occupation phase is marked by rough arrangements within the existing walls. Notable among the finds was a two-faced glass head 2cm high (Fig. 30). A well which was excavated to the water level (10m deep) produced a large amount of pottery and much well-preserved wood, including a miniature Doric column. S. Huber explored the very disturbed area to the E of the Apollo Temple. She found levels equivalent to that of the Temple construction of the 6th Ct BC. Study of the pottery may give a more precise date for the construction of the temple. Several sections of G walling were found, including a small piece of an oval building similar to the nearby bronze- smith's workshop. In the same area five large pits, filled with big stones, produced pottery of the 8th and 7th Cts. The function of the pits is unclear. A well of the end of the HL period produced an impressive quantity of pottery and of tiles. In 1992 three excavations took place: K. Reber continued his work on the houses along the W wall. The HL and C levels of the whole area have now been cleared and the plan is interpreted as workshops requiring numerous channels for the inflow and outflow of water. Interesting finds include a pithos mended with lead clamps in antiquity, some fragments of painted plaster and of mosaic. A well within the building dug to a depth of 10m produced bronze slag, half an Attic cup of high quality, fragments of terracotta dolls and much pottery of as early as the 8th Ct BC. Other deep tests also produced G material, notably the tomb of a young girl with an amber necklace. The pottery from this tomb was also 8th Ct. S. Huber continued her work E and NE of the Apollo Temple. Along the E wall of the Temple a series of layers of fine sand and clay 1.50m deep seem to indicate an anc. watercourse. The number of hearths close by give evidence of intense occupation of this area in the G period. In the N part of the sector late antique and ECh levels (walls along a roadway, a well and five tombs) precluded deeper exploration. One tomb contained a vase and a bronze earring. One test reached a curved G wall. P. Friedemann and J. Bernal excavated a structure on the slope of the acropolis at about 62m ASL. Part of this structure had been cleared at the beginning of the century; it comprises a vast complex including a cistern and a group of subsidiary buildings in good condition (Fig. 31). The cistern (8.5 x 7m) was built in isodomic masonry bonded with a mortar contain- ing tile grog and carefully lined with hydraulic cement both on the inside and the part of the outside which stood clear of ground level; it must have been for the collection of rainwater as no water source has been identified on the acropolis. The other constructions, all later than the cistern, are situated below it on the slope and include a small basin (3 x 1m) with a tile mosaic floor, completely covered by a layer of hydraulic cement. In the first phase a lead pipe and in a layer one a channel of terracotta led water through a relief spout into a semicircular basin. To the N a small tile room contained a terracotta bath (Fig. 32); a channel from the N side of the cistern connected with it." Glypha (anc. Aulis). E.

Surface indications that the cemetery extended considerably S of the excavated area, noted after the site around it had been cleared up in 1991, proved to be illusory. Nevertheless, a trial in that region did locate considerably below the surface a large pyre covered by boulders: it contained a great quantity of wood ash and one find, a bronze fibula of SPG type. Another test, closer to and immediately S of the building, did not confirm the suspected extension of the cemetery in that direction but uncovered a stretch of E-W walling which may have served to help retain the mound erected over the building. The area of the main cemetery, E of pyres 8 and 23, was examined to find the limit of the burial ground in that direction. Three pyres were found and excavated and one large tomb with immense cover slabs. The woman interred in it had been provided with gilt hair coils, crystal-headed iron pins and six bronze fibulae. At her midriff had been placed a bronze situla (badly crushed) and an engraved Near Eastern bronze bowl which retained slight but certain signs of its original gilding (Fig. 33). The situla and a bronze jug with lotus-flower handle, placed within it, are currently undergoing cleaning. Her hands, with their nine gold rings, had been placed over the bowl and were the only parts of the skeleton preserved, so confirming the severely corrosive nature of the soil.

FRENCH evidence for the layout and architecture of the HL town and its fortification, and also provided some information on the earlier A and C periods, and of the decline after the R destruction in 168 BC. Many areas however had suffered disturbance from Byz and Post Byz structures (including kilns and a workshop) and prolific pits. Several plots (notably one on Kommenou below a LByz and E Post Byz church with many spolia) gave more evidence of the Sacred Way (AR 1991-92, 35), an 11m wide road leading through the W cemetery S from the S gate of the city. The road itself was in use from A to ECh with evidence of flooding in the 2nd Ct BC and of earthquake in the I st Ct BC. Funerary monuments were excavated on both sides, of which monument A on the E was the most important possibly in all Greece. Remains of the dedicatory epigram were found both in situ and fallen immediately below (?from the earth- quake) allowing about two-thirds to be restored, but unfor- tunately without some vital information. The epigram is in three lines, boostrophedon in the A Cor alphabet. It indicates that the monument is a public cenotaph for those who died in a shipwreck (cf IG IX,1,868 from Corcyra). On a stele which had fallen in front of the monument we read: TEAE KOPIN- O10 and can conclude that this commemorates the cooperation of Ambrakia and Corinth in a sea battle, probably that against Corcyra at the beginning of the 6th Ct BC. Later a single mid-4th Ct BC burial was made in the monument, presumably of a public figure. Monument B, also on the E, was more typical, containing 34 tombs (8 cists. 21 tile, 1 built, 4 containers with clay urns and a 4th Ct BC bronze cremation ur) arranged on four levels showing continuous usage from the 4th Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD. Pieces of 64 grave stelai came to light, mainly reused, as well as many other finds. Monuments r (on the E) as well as A and E (on the W) were only partially cleared. (ADelt 41 Chr, 103-5) Several areas of the city wall were investigated and it is planned to expropriate so that some well-preserved sections can remain visible. The HL houses were arranged in a grid system, with many N-S roads only some 30m apart but with avenues more widely spaced running E-W (as in the adjacent cities). The N-S roads had a drainage channel at one side and a footpath on the other. On Kyprou and Ag. Nikolaou the whole of a comer house was fully cleared and showed evidence of two periods of use. Its corer position made some slight differences to the canoni- cal plan, notably the displacement of the kitchen area to behind the antron and there were additional entrances from the side street. From the second phase of the corer room (although it had been badly looted) came a statue of Aphrodite and another statue (the first known from excavation in Arta). The building was destroyed at the end of the 3rd/beginning of the 2nd Ct BC; there was rebuilding at the end of the 2nd/beginning of the 1st Ct BC. (ADelt 41 Chr, 105-7) Two houses had baths, and in another at Souliou 14 were three areas with signs of burning and deposits of votives, which, as they did not come from a cult area, are thought to mark foundation deposits of some kind. (ADelt 41 Chr, 109-10) On Arachthou another corner house had adjacent to it a small triangular plateia marking the space between it and the city wall. The square atrium had stoas of differing sizes on three sides with four pilasters each; there was the setting of a single column at the SW corner. A plaster floor had patterns in pebbles. (ADelt 41 Chr, 110-2) From the C period a small plot on Komnenon produced a two-room structure: the N room had a stair of seven steps leading up to a rectangular area with a well in the corer. This well (as others) had been in use until recent times. It is suggested that this complex had a connection with the fortifica- tions. (ADelt 41 Chr, 112-3) Bathy Gorgomylou.

It was shown that the benches of the R period continued on the S side also, but on the W there was a corridor connecting with the rest of the complex. The row of seating on the E also continues S of the doorway. Tests to the S revealed further R structures, and excavation of the W side of the peristyle showed that it had 7 x 4 columns resting on re-used dedicatory bases. Tests by the E wall to bedrock produced detailed stratigraphic evidence of the history of the area which can be linked to historical events. A small circular paved structure 2m in diameter may have served as a sort of kitchen for feeding the officials. The core of the Prytaneion in the late 4th and early 3rd Cts was like a HL house with hearth and court; the wing at the N was added after the end of the 3rd Ct with its three nine-bedded rooms and three service rooms.

This island's claim to be Homeric Ithaca is discussed in Nea 7.7.92 et al. Lefkas survey. Professors J. Carter and S. Morris (ASCS) report on their work in 1992: "Three sites were the focus of survey, as specified in our permit: we concentrated on cleaning, drawing and photograph- ing the remains of Gr towers at Sta Marmara and Kleismatia N and S of the village of Marantochori, and at Lithofli in the high plain above Enklouvi. The remains of the towers were recorded in actual state plans at 1:50, including elevations where more than one course was preserved and visible; a site plan at 1:100 was also prepared for the two sites near Maranto- chori. The site of Sta Marmara lies on the slope rising W from the plain below and W of the prehistoric cave site of Choiro- spilia (excavated by Doipfeld). The ruins include two towers, both square in shape and measuring just under 7 x 7m, located approximately 35m apart on the slope. The tower furthest W has been built into a mod. terrace wall which preserves the E face of the tower to a height of four ashlar courses above its euthynteria level. Of the remaining sides, only a line of six blocks of its W face survive, buried in a terrace about 4m above the lowermost E course. The E tower preserves all four of its anc. sides, but stands only two courses high on its W, N and E sides; the S side, mostly missing above its euthynteria course, is presumed to have had an entrance. Unlike its neighbour this tower is polygonal in masonry technique, with an outer polygonal face backed by interior courses of smaller, roughly ashlar stones. Its E face stands three courses high and could be drawn in elevation: the top course forms a horizontal surface free of cuttings and suggesting upper stories of mud-</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 43 brick. The interior of this tower is filled with rubble debris from collapsed upper walls and could not be cleared to bedrock. An anc. cistern lies approximately midway between the two towers, filled with mod. rubble; it was included in our site plan. At Kleismatia, a site in the middle of a plain, we also traced the outline of two towers, one round and one square; the round tower seems to have gone out of use before the construc- tion of a square, ashlar successor built 5m to the W. The earlier tower survives as part of a circle of large polygonal blocks; traces of unbaked mud-brick concentrated in the debris over its N edge suggest that it might have had a mud-brick superstructure. Only two sides (W and S) of the square tower survive in one course above buried foundations. Both towers are disturbed by the massive trunk and root systems of living olive trees of considerable age. These two towers must have stood near other buildings: to the S can be traced the ashlar blocks of regularly aligned foundations for walls or structures, extending some 40m to the S and at least 30m to the E. We imagine an establishment at Kleismatia similar to the tower at Poros, with a round tower, replaced by a square tower, and a sizable complex of industrial buildings. The tower at Lithofli, above Enklouvi lies on the S edge of a fertile plain planted today with lentils and wheat, and presumably cultivated in antiquity. The polygonal sides of this square tower stand two courses high on the E, S, and W (the N face is buried in heavy stone debris), with the top course forming a flat bedding for higher courses. An entrance is surmised at the W end of the S side, where the polygonal blocks are interrupted by a large rectangular space 4m wide; an enormous block with cuttings as if for threshhold or lintel lies overturned just before this opening. Our research at these three sites is virtually complete in terms of documentation in drawings and photography. Careful study of the notebooks kept by Dorpfeld (now stored in Nidri) had provided us with valuable information about the condition in which he found these sites, his observations on them and his description and illustrations of objects found nearby. We have alerted the guard to visible surface remains of pottery and stone tools (grinders, mortars) to be collected for storage in the Leukas museum. In addition, in the company of the guard and the Ephor, we visited other towers at Kastri (Helleniko) S of Marantochori above the coast, at Magemeno on the E coast, at Kroupa E of Nidri on the peninsula where D6rpfeld's house once stood, and at Ag. Philippos near Enklouvi. A third site near Marantochori with the mod. name of Pyrgi reveals the remains of another round tower. We are providing the Ephorate with the precise location of these towers on 1:5,000 maps with photographs and dimensions. At least one of these sites--at Magemeno, which appears on Dorpfeld's map as an 'Antike Burg'-has been damaged in mod. construction of new homes, and the need for documentation is urgent. The results of our second season on Leukas have more than doubled the number of towers once reported by Dorpfeld (7). This new corpus offers a challenging variety of natural environments, tower shapes and sizes, masonry styles, and possible anc. functions. Several sites, in particular those around Marantochori, might reward excavation by contributing to the picture of anc. Gr rural settlements and their fate in R times." Longades. The find of a R cist tomb is reported. (ADelt 40 Chr, 224) Merope: Paliouria (AR 1990-91, 41). Cleaning in the area of the tumuli brought to light three cists (6th-3rd Ct AD) and, N of tumulus #5 and by #6 in the stone pile, an oval hole and two small cist graves of children with no gifts. Of considerable interest was the find, some 50m E of the main group of tumuli, of foundations belonging to an unknown HL settlement. A square building (6.5 x 6.5m) was cleared, revealing a destruc- tion level marked by Laconian tiles. many loomweights and clay pot supports (from a kiln). The structure is dated to LHL by both the unpainted and bg pottery. (ADelt 41 Chr, 102-3) Metsobo. A visit by the authorities is reported to the site of Beratori which Leake (and also Hammond) believed to be the fortification guarding the E-W pass. There is certainly a fortification wall enclosing an area 700 x 1400m. Unfortunately bad weather prevented the collection of surface material. (ADelt 41 Chr, 114) Michalitsi: Koukos. Two C cist graves with pots and iron weapons are reported from a cemetery already known, though the city to which it belongs is not. One cover slab bore an inscription in secondary usage: HZYXIA/AAKINOA/ZAXYN- OIAI. (ADelt 40 Chr, 224) Nikopolis. Professor J.R. Wiseman reports: "The Nikopolis Project is engaged in multi-disciplinary archaeological research conducted jointly by Boston University and two Greek archaeological Ephorates: the 12th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities and the 8th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities. The Project has as its broad, general aim the explanation of the changing relationships between humans and the landscape they inhabited and exploited in S Epirus, from earliest PR times through the Med period. The Project takes its name from the R imperial urban centre of the region. Archaeological Diachronic Survey: Intensive archaeological surface survey was carried out in total of 71 areas (in project terminology, tracts) of different size in eight different regions of the survey area, representing different environmental zones. The total area surveyed is 437,531.08m2. In addition, a few of the site/scatters identified in 1991 were revisited and surface material collected in 1992, and a total of 34 new site/scatters were designated (92-1 to 92-37, but numbers 92-28, 92-34, 92- 35 were not used). The survey teams counted 12,672 sherds, 55,902 bricks or roof tiles, 830 lithics, and other artifacts. A total of 8,589 artifacts were collected and are now stored, according to their context (called samples, which are desig- nated by tract, site/scatter, or area identification) or project inventory number, in the Archaeological Museum at Ioannina. The results of survey in the eight regions are summarized briefly here: Kastro Rogon (SS91-1). Seventeen tracts were walked and four sites/scatters were identified in fields to the N, E, and W of Kastro Rogon. Most of the artifacts belong to the Byz and Ott periods, but some pieces of bg ware are LC and HL, and a few other sherds may belong to the R period. The finds suggest several farmsteads or small communities sur- rounding Kastro Rogon in Med and Ott times, with a particu- larly heavy concentration outside the NE gate of the Kastro. The large number of vitrified roof tiles and other material in all the areas suggests human agency if the destructions were contemporary. Strongyli: Ridge N of Koryphi (SS91-10). The ruins near the town of Strongyli, most of them on a low ridge N of the hill Koryphi, have been noted by Dakaris, Hammond, and other archaeologists. The site on the ridge was visited in 1991 and designated SS91-10, and in 1992 much staff time was devoted to the several sectors of the site. The areas of activity include an area where olives were milled and pressed (two presses and</page><page sequence="42">44 E.B. FRENCH three mills are visible); a large brick and concrete structure with multiple vaulted rooms that may be part of a bath or a church; a building on top of the ridge with mosaics visible in two rooms (one with five colours) and associated with several scattered architectural blocks: thresholds, cornices with mouldings; other blocks and a basin are nearby on the N slope, which is littered with tiles and bricks; and further E along the ridge a cemetery where two plundered slab-sided cist graves are visible. Most of these remains are R in date, perhaps over a considerable time span: the sherds include a lamp fragment of the 2nd or 3rd Ct and late antique orange grooved amphora fragments. They may represent a villa rustica or a small community. E of the ridge what is probably a tower (associated with a farmstead?) is partially preserved. The masonry is a combination of coursed trapezoidal and polygonal, combined with ashlar (esp. at the comers), all suggesting a date in the late 4th or 3rd Ct BC, as do some sherds from Tracts 92-30 and 92-31 in nearby fields. There are remains of later times, probably LByz or Ott (including a foot bridge), to the W of the ridge. The area has been surveyed, photographed and many of the architectural pieces inventoried. The Ephorate has been made aware of the urgency to excavate and preserve the mosaics, and to excavate the cemetery (two graves have already been plundered): both have been frequented by locals and are now even better known in the area. Ag. Aikaterini, SW of Strongyli. The church of Ag. Aikaterina gives its name to this ridge SW of Strongyli; the ridge may have been an island at some time in the past. Tracts 92-22 to -24 were surveyed in the immediate vicinity of the church, and produced several sherds from large storage jars and amphoras, possibly LR in date. The church itself had no spolia visible. Tracts 92-25 and -26 were surveyed along the SE coast of the ridge, where the artifact density was much higher; the area was then designated SS92-31. The sherds here, like those on the ridge, had a high proportion of transport/storage vessels, possibly LR/EByz. Two glazed bases indicate activity here also during the Ott period. E of Archangelos. This region, including the plain known as Grammeno, was explored extensively and intensively. Tract 92-39 on a hill overlooking the plain on the N produced nearly 20,000 artifacts and was designated SS92-6; it is near the line of the aqueduct. Most of the sherds are R, but some HL sherds occur as do some Ott glazed sherds. Two important sites of the Byz and Ott period are also on hills along the N side of the plain: the ruined church of Ag. Odigitria (SS92-26) and the Monastery of Kozyli. Kastrosykia. The areas investigated along the beach, lower slopes, and even higher elevations produced mainly lithic material and little ceramics. The area requires further explora- tion in 1993. Area of Rizovouni and Romia. Three tracts were walked within or adjacent to the walls of Kastro Rizovouni; material recovered includes sherds that are LC or HL and many from Byz and Ott periods. Other tracts to the E produced few artifacts, and the area may have been covered at some periods by a larger version of the lake (Mavri) that existed further E until it was drained in this century. Tract 92-77, however, did produce some flake tools, possibly Pal in date. Stephani Region. The local name Eli refers to three low mounds S of Stephani, which may at one time have been islands in the N part of the Ambracian Gulf. A small settle- ment of the Ott period occupied the top of the central mound (site/scatter 92-32); a lithic scatter here may belong to an earlier period. Acheron Valley. In addition to the several important Pal sites discovered along the Acheron (see next section) a number of important finds of later periods were made here. In the N at Vouvopotamos there is an important BA site (probably EBA), that already had the designation SS92-12 because of the Pal remains found earlier in the summer. The finds included thousands of handmade sherds, and large chunks of daub. Other productive tracts were surveyed on and near Sphyra (N and BA material) and near the village of Themelos (a possible stone tool production site, SS92-36; some Ott pottery). Palaeolithic Survey: The survey benefitted greatly from the supervised classification of the Kokkinopilos landscape (see below, section VI), which made possible the prediction of several locations, and from the cooperation of Dr. Panayiotis Paschos of the Preveza office of IGME, who has also been studying the redbeds of Epirus. Of 20 site/scatters identified and sampled, 14 produced materials classified as Pal, and two are LPal or Meso; the remainder are of uncertain date. Two of the Pal sites probably date to the Lower Pal: stratified deposits at Rodaki (S/S92-15) at the mouth of the Paliourias river in Kastrosykia, and surface finds from Pleistocene deposits at Alonaki (S/S92-22) near the mouth of the Acheron. The EMidPal is well represented among the 1992 sites, including finds at sites where the raw materials were probably quarried. C. Runnels points out that sites of this period seem to be arranged along an E-W line from the interior highlands to the coast. The inland sites are clustered around the Thesprotiko valley and may have attracted the hunter/gatherers because of the abundant water there in springs, seasonal lakes, and the PR Thesprotiko river. The line of sinkholes from Kokkinopilos across the valley is then extended along the S side of the Acheron drainage to the sea, with access not only to water, but also to raw materials. Later Mid and later Upper Pal are not represented among the 1992 results, and may be rare in S Epirus. Geophysical Survey: (1) Offshore. The Hellenic Naval Ship Pytheas, under the control of the Hellenic Hydrographic Service, joined us to help determine diachronic coastal change along the Ionian shoreline and the N coast of the Ambracian Gulf. The ship was outfitted with a new model of the Klein sidescan sonar and Klein sub-bottom profiler, as well as a bathymetric sensor. The sidescan sonar detects features on the surface of the sea bottom, while the sub-bottom profiler provides data for understanding the depth and nature of sediments below the floor of the sea. The bathymetric charts are also indispensable for providing the depth of the water column, as well as the location of hazards that might damage the ship or the sensors being towed in a device called a fish. Locational readings were provided by transponders strategically placed on shore and by Project GPS readings. Data totalling about 300 linear-km were collected for the area between Mytikas and Kastrosykia off Nikopolis beach, including lines perpendicular and parallel to the shore. In the Ambracian Gulf traverses and perpendiculars were run in a tighter grid (300m to a side) between the Ag. Thomas penin- sula and the N coast, extending from off Nikopolis to Salaora. Other lines were run along the S side of Ag. Thomas penin- sula. The ship did not carry equipment for digital recording of the geophysical data, and only preliminary examinations of the data readouts have so far been possible. They must be studied in Boston during the coming year, and correlated with the analyses of geological coring before final interpretations are possible. The data, however, are of excellent quality, both in depth and in detail, and should yield important information of sea level change.</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 45 Preliminary and very tentative results include evidence for the following, according to Schneider: (a) Possible underwater springs were noted near Kastrosykia point, which may be significant for the study of early settlement or hunting patterns, depending on whether these were ever above sea level during a period of human presence in Epirus. (b) Discovery of two raised ridges off the Ionian coast that conceivably could have reduced wave action for harbour areas at a time when the sea level was lower. (c) Several channels of former rivers, some of them stacked (and therefore datable on a relative basis), that seem to be related to major onshore faults and passes were discovered in the Ionian seas. (d) In the Ambracian Gulf fault- bounded blocks seem to follow onshore faulting trends, some of which are active. They will be significant evidence for the palaeogeographic reconstruction of the Nikopolis area. (2) On-land Survey. Geophysical survey on land was restricted by staff size and equipment problems in 1992. The ground-penetrating radar was evidently damaged in transit and repair could not be completed during the summer. The staff, although relatively large, was insufficient to permit the assigning of a regular geophysical team. Nonetheless, an electromagnetic conductivity survey and magnetometer survey were run in the area immediately N of Kastro Rogon (location of Tract 92-1) and a magnetometer survey was conducted E of Archangelos (location of Tract 92-39). Geological Coring: A total of 21 effective geological cores were drilled to depths up to 8.45m. From these cores 193 samples were taken and have been sent to the Archaeometry Lab of the University of Minnesota at Duluth where they will be analyzed over the coming months. The aims of the analyses are: to identify the succession of depositions in coastal and other environments; to date as many of the deposits as needed to construct a chronology of local change in the coastal regions; to analyze microfauna, macrofauna, and other material (e.g., pollen in the core from former Late Mavri) for palaeo- environmental reconstruction. The cores were drilled in four regions and the preliminary results are presented below: Lowland immediately N of Nikopolis walls. Six cores were taken: two on the barrier of the Mazoma, four on the land further W. They show that there were at least two periods of sea transgression-regression within 8m of deposits. What is more, the marine deposits are interbedded with alluvial deposits on which two palaeosols developed. In one core near the anc. wall of the city pottery of the ER period was encountered at a depth of 7.10-7.30m, both overlaid and underlaid by alluvial palaeosols. Mavrovouni Ridge area. Eight cores were taken in the region. Three of them were near the C monument and R site N of Koryphi. These three revealed two transgression- regression cycles of marine and alluvial deposits within a depth of 7.5m. They show that the sea once extended much further to the N than it does today and that Mavrovouni and the associated ridges on the N had once been an island. Three cores were taken on the barrier between the Ambracian Gulf and the lagoon: one W of Vigla and two W of Salaora; two others were drilled in the swamp S of Strongyli town. Lab analysis will help us to understand the past coastal arrange- ment, but the cores on the barrier itself were only partially successful because the hand auger does not hold the loose sand of the barrier. Lake Mavri. One core was taken in former Lake Mavri, primarily to study the vegetation and climatic history of the area. The lake sediment was found to be covered by 4.7m of alluvial deposits. Coastal Plain of the Acheron River. Five cores were drilled in this region, and revealed that the buried marine layers below the Acheron floodplain extends at least 1.5km to the E and km to the N of the present coast. Fanari Bay was much larger during a long period in the past, and the differing depths of alluvial deposits suggest that the areas on the N and W may have been higher than those to the S and E in the past. A sixth core was drilled in the bed of the anc. Lake Acherousia, E of the coastal plain. Remote Sensing: A complete computer lab for image processing and GIS (geographic information system) was set up at the Project base, including a Sun IPX SparcStation with peripherals and an Altek digitizing tablet. The setup was accomplished (with considerable difficulty) by Juliano and Stein, and it became possible to digitize in PCI, but it has not been possible to digitize in GRASS, the application of choice. Stein and Cullen carried out a supervised classification (no. 52) of redbeds, based primarily on the classification of Kokkino- pilos. The classification was then tested in the field by six ground-truthing expeditions; in all cases redbeds were con- firmed, and in five of the six PR stone tools were associated with landscape. Since the sixth was covered largely by a new slaughterhouse and was therefore inaccessible, success may have 100%. Aerial photography from the tethered blimp: The program for aerial photography was curtailed somewhat by a delayed permit because of military operations in the area, delayed deliveries of hydrogen, and on two occasions by weather. Nonetheless we were able to complete four successful flights. Both black-and-white and colour photographs were taken over the following sites: Kastro Rogon; Kastro Rizovouni; Voulista Panayia; aqueduct at Ag. Yeoryios. Databases: The relational database application selected for use by the Nikopolis Project is Foxbase. All databases described in this section utilize Foxbase, and will eventually be related. Ground-Truthing Database. In 1991 a database for ground- truthing data was completed, refined, and a program written by Bob DeRoy. GTF's (Ground-Truthing Forms) 91-1 to 102 were entered into the database. Early in the 1992 season Dan Juliano refined the program somewhat, but has concluded that the program as written is somewhat eccentric and requires further modification and documentation to enhance its utility to the Project. The Program as is, however, is fully functional, and GTF92-1 to 6 (the results of the 1992 season in confirming the supervised classification of eroded redbed landscapes) have been entered. Archaeological Site/Scatter Database. The site/scatter was largely constructed in 1991, but the structure was modified and the number of fields enlarged in 1992 by Wiseman and Juliano. Input screens were also created, and a program to activate the user interface will be written during the coming academic year. Site/Scatters 91-1 to 10 were entered in 1991; in 199.2 these were modified and site/scatters 92-1 to 92-37 were added, excluding three numbers as noted above. Archaeological Survey Tracts Database. The form for survey tracts was discussed and a draft created during the spring of 1992 at Boston. After field trial early in the 1992 field season, the form was modified to include additional data and the format enhanced. The database structure was created and refined in July by J. Wiseman, and data on all tracts walked in 1992 (92-1 to 92-69, 92-77, 92-78) were entered by K. Alford. A Tract Summary is made which gives for each tract the size of the area walked and the total count of sherds, bricks/tiles, and lithics, and the total of all objects noted.</page><page sequence="44">46 E.B. FRENCH Artifact Samples Database. All samples of artifacts from tracts, site/scatters, or walkovers were entered by D. King and K. Alford in a database structured by J. Wiseman. The artifact samples entered in 1992 totalled 191 records representing 8,589 artifacts now in the Project contextual storage or among the inventoried objects. Inventoried Artifacts Database. The categories and forms for inventoried artifacts were created by L. Wiseman in consultation with J. Wiseman; they are modified versions of the system used by them on the Stobi Project. J. Wiseman created the database structure in July 1992. Objects were inventoried by L. Wiseman and M. Moore, with various assistant. Totals of inventoried artifacts are as follows: pottery: 153; terracotta architecture: 14; stone architecture: 20; miscel- laneous finds: 11; coins: 1; lamps: 3; stone tools: 86; Total artifacts inventoried: 288. Conclusions and Observations: The Nikopolis Project carried out survey in several different environmental zones of S Epirus. Although the areas have been only sampled, the results so far indicate that the landscape of S Epirus is rich in cultural material of many different periods. Some 20 find spots, including stratified remains, of Lower, Mid and Upper Pal tools were recorded; N and BA material also occurred. Although there was little indication of the G and A periods, artifacts or in situ remains were noted that date from C times through the Turkokratia. Further survey both in the zones already selected and in others (especially along the Acheron, the Louros, and highland areas) is required. The database of site/scatters is now well underway, but the data for sites/scatters in the Ephorates in Ioannina have not yet been made available for data entry. It would be particularly helpful for planning if the databases could be combined before next summer. The several geological tests and geophysical surveys have already contributed signifi- cantly to our study of the changing landscape of S Epirus, as indicated above in Section V, from the more than 200 samples that will undergo laboratory analyses in the United States. It is certain that additional cores will be required, including perhaps some offshore, and an extensive, land-based geophysical survey of a number of sites/scatters is still required. A major lack is stratigraphic control of cultural material, especially pottery, since there have been so few stratigraphic excavations in the region, and there is little dated material available in Epirus to provide a secure chronological framework for the new material being gathered by the Project. The satellite imagery continues to add additional data and may be used for predictive modelling both of sites and resources as we continue to work on the supervised classification of specific types of landcover (e.g. quarries, hilltop forts). We have barely begun the enor- mous task of creating the geographic information system for the region, which involves locating the cultural remains by period on the satellite imagery and on digitized maps." Eleutherotypia 21.1.93 et al. comment on consideration at the Central Archaeological Council of means to prevent damage to this extensive site. Perama Ioanninon. On the slope of the hill with the Perama Cave, many HL sherds, four iron spear heads and one knife as well as PR pottery were collected. (ADelt 41 Chr, 113) Philippias (Philippiada). By the 64km mark of the Arta- Ioannina road a tile grave of the end of the 4th Ct BC came to light. (ADelt 41 Chr, 114) P. Vokotopoulos publishes the account of his work in 1989 on the monastery church of the Pantanassa in PAE, 169-175. In 1992 (Ergon, 59-63) his work here consisted mainly of conservation (the floor of the main church and the slabs of the N stoa) and preparation for the 1993 season (levelling and clearing the S side of the site). Among finds of interest are: a series of small marble sections showing that the floor was similar to that at Vlachema and at Ag. Theodora, Arta); a section of fresco (7 x 7cm) from W of the NW pillar showing a male figure; inscribed bricks, one with FFEA; and a fragment of a Cor column capital. Stefane. A important hoard of bronzes in good condition, mainly axes but also spear heads, was handed in from this village. (ADelt 41 Chr, 114) Theriakesio Ioanninon. Following the report of surface walling, test excavation brought to light house walls at this site which lies a short distance from a known acropolis. The presence of a second site at this natural approach route to Dodona is of interest and more work is planned for the future. (ADelt 41 Chr, 113-4) SOUTHERN THESSALY (13th Ephorate) A report of rescue work by the Ephorate in 1985 is published in ADelt Chr, 40, 182-197, but none for 1986 has appeared. M. McAllister, Th. Mackay and G. Korres publish a catalogue of the C cities of Thessaly in Thessaliko Emerologio 20, 17-28 and in the same journal (95-112) K. Gallis continues his atlas of PR sites (now also published separately, see above). Aedonochori (Chotiana). During road widening in 1985 at least three cist tombs were found, probably ECh, containing bronze earrings and an amber necklace. (ADelt 40 Chr, 195-6) Ag. Georgios. On the S side of the village a tomb was found, a long narrow cist, probably Ch, with no finds. Villagers said that others had been found in the area. (ADelt 40 Chr, 193) Ag. Theodoroi. At Paliokastra deep ploughing revealed archi- tectural remains in poros in a pit. In the excavation which followed more architecture came to light: Doric columns, capitals and geisons; Ionic columns and geisons, several with traces of the original plaster surface. These, together with marble statuary found previously, must be interpreted as the deposit from a shrine, presumably connected with Kierion some 3km to the E. (ADelt 40 Chr, 196) Almyros. At Kaloerika in the community of Platanos part of the anc. cemetery came to light during ploughing. This area lies SE of the HL city of Halos (see below). Ten tombs, poros cists with one clay lamax, were excavated; each contained between one and three burials. (ADelt 40 Chr, 184-5) Alonessos (Placed in error AR 1991-92, 7 off Attica). Reports on the important underwater work here in 1992 are published widely, e.g. Eleutherotypia 22.1.93.

Some 2km ENE of here in road widening 13 tombs (one tiled, the others cist) came to light. All but one were robbed; it contained HL finds. No settlement site is known from close by; the nearest is Kastania (anc. Menelais). (ADelt 40 Chr, 194-5)</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 47 Argalaste. A. Ntina (ADelt 41 Chr, 89-90) reports a survey at Lephokastron: Karmpia which may indicate that this may have been the site of the Byz Lyphokastron (walls and mortar, Byz wall remains, and glazed and sgraffito pottery etc.) (A. Avramea, Byzantine Thessaly to 1204, 106-7). Argithea. A complete bronze sword was handed in from the HL city at Ellenika. (ADelt 40 Chr, 197) Belestino (anc. Pherai) (AR 1991-92, 38). Six excavations are reported for 1985. The HL ceramic workshop noted in 1984 was confirmed, as were the two building phases of the adjacent structures (HL resting on C of the 4th Ct BC). The workshop consists of two areas, one roofed with plastered walls, possibly a living area, and one open. It is built in the same technique as the later of the adjacent buildings; the earlier of these is better built and founded on virgin soil. A cistern and a tiled vat for clay are associated with the workshop. Later three kilns were constructed in the building itself; in pits between them were deposits of animal bones, sherds, tiles and many small finds, notably moulds, figurines and plaques as well as moulds for Megarian bowls. At Aulagadia on the S side of the anc. city a complex of two single-phase HL, buildings on virgin soil are interpreted as the workshop for a kiln previously found nearby. An area with tiles (like the vat for clay from the previous site) can probably be associated with another workshop. On Feron on the SE slopes of Magoula Bakale at the centre of the anc. city, a plot was found to contain Ott buildings built on those of the 4th to 3rd Cts BC (dated by finds including a gold earring). Other earlier material lay below but further excavation was impossible in the small area available. Also on Feron, a piece of public land designated for a nursery school was tested and found to have good HL build- ings. The school was re-sited elsewhere. In another plot on Feron a trial trench found HL sherds immediately overlying MBA sherds. The MBA layer rested on virgin soil which had been cut for a foundation of unknown purpose and for a well. An MBA tomb with one burial but no finds also came to light. At a spot on the N edge of the mod. town, but within the anc. city, a strong wall came to light and below it G sherds. The stratigraphy gave evidence of continued occupation over a long period but also of a sand layer which may be associated with the adjacent Hypereion Spring. (ADelt 40 Chr, 191-3) Demetriada (anc. Demetrias) (AR 1991-92, 39). Four excava- tions took place in 1985. The first was a continuation of one from the previous year and produced more HL pottery, lead artifacts and 2nd Ct BC coins; it is thought a workshop for lead and other metals existed at this spot. Finds noted during the development of the road from Volos to Mikrothebai, which cuts the centre of the site, from build- ings to N &amp; S of the theatre were carefully recorded. In another area, from which previous evidence of cemeteries was known, a LA tomb with bg lekythoi was found; nearby a deposit of the 3rd Ct BC with coins and figurines came to light as well as a partially destroyed tomb of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. At Soros, an expanse of some four stremmata of the LA-C necropolis was available for excavation in 1985-6, exposing some 155 tombs in all of which nos. 1-78 are briefly reported. (ADelt 40 Chr, 185-91) Dimini. The possibility that recent work proves that this site (and not Volos) is the legendary Iolkos was put forward in a presentation by the Ephorate this spring which is fully pub- lished by Tachydromos (Volos) in three issues, 18, 23, 30.5.93. Halos. During a survey by the Halos team of the Dutch Archaeological School, in collaboration with Greek archaeol- ogists from the Volos museum, in the southern part of the Almyros valley (including spurs of the Othrys mountains), three HL settlements were discovered and a PR one. Three known settlements were measured; sherds are found well beyond their walls, as is the case with the Magoula Zerelia. Members of the Dutch School studied in their storeroom at Almyros the finds from previous Halos excavations and surveys in the neighbourhood. Kallithero (anc. Kallithera) (AR 1991-92, 39). On the E edge of the mod. village, but within the anc. E cemetery, two tombs were found, cists built from river stones and tiles but with no finds and thus undatable. On M. Alexandrou a part of the N fortification wall was cleared with a pebble road leading inside. Here lay a house with four rooms and a stone drain. The area is to be expropriated. (ADelt 40 Chr, 194) Karditsa. S. Sdrolia reports on excavations in 1985 and 1986 in the small kastron (six towers) at Phanari, first mentioned in the sources in 1303 (+/- 2,600m2).

More of the deposit of protomes and figurines came to light but no boundaries were found. Else- where HL walling came to light, and at Chelonokastro, the walled city, a block was noted built into the boundary wall of the tenienos of Ag.

All can be dated to R times by the lettering and deal with emancipations. They had doubtless been brought here from neighbouring Philia, from the shrine of Itonian Athena. (ADelt 40 Chr, 197) Metropole. Testing on the site for a supermarket brought to light two 4th Ct AD buildings separated by a narrow drain. Two rooms of the S building have mosaic pavements with geometric patterns. The inscription on a reused stele gives the first evidence of Zeus from this area (AII/OMOAOIOI). Elsewhere a circular pit with openings was interpreted as a kiln and was dated by the find of a 2nd Ct BC skyphos; pottery samples were given to the Fitch Laboratory in the hope of identifying local workshops.

Ntina (ADelt 40 Chr, 219) mentions trial excavations in 1985 on Ralle Ralle and Ellenikes Aeroporeias of parts of a very important ?ecclesiasti- cal structure associated with a building partly excavated in a neighbouring plot in 1983-4. (ADelt 38 Chr, 225, and 39 Chr, 173-5) Many graves of all types were discovered throughout the town, dates unspecified, but some with funerary inscriptions: on Diakopoulou: (i) MNHMION AIADEPQN EY/XEBIOY HPAQMATEYTOY TENAIAIOY /ENOA KATAKITAI MAPIA /H FAMETH AYTOY, (ii) MNHMION AIADE/PON KYPIAIQNI /ANAFNQETOY EAENH /KAI AAE_ANAPQ, (iii) [KOIM]HTH/[PION AIA]/EPQN TOY /AFHOY ONH/XIMOY +.

(ADelt 40 Chr, 219-21) Further excavations in 1986 mentioned by Ntina include continuing investigations at the basilica complex of the EByz Archierarch Petros which uncovered part of the baptistery, of the apsidal building and a large extent of the anc. city wall (ADelt 41 Chr, 86-9). Excavations in the vicinity (Ralle Ralle and Ellenikes Aeroporeias) uncovered yet more parts of the outbuildings associated with the Petros basilica and that of Ag. Demetrios, which may be identified with contemporary charitable institutions etc.; a number of notable moveable and architectural finds were uncovered. Also found elsewhere in the town were ECh tombs, some with inscriptions, the remains of more than one ECh private house, and the remains of part of the water supply system, once again accompanied by a number of finds. The remains of what must have been an imposing ECh (ecclesiastical?) building were encountered 200m E of the basilica of the bishop Elpidos, but only limited investigation was possible. This provided evidence for a mosaic floor, fine quality architectural members, and an apsidal exedra. A 50m length of the sea walls was also cleared. Finally, another large ECh structural complex (basilica?) was located in the vicinity of the Aerodrome. A considerable list of further chance finds, including many LR/EByz burials, are reported in ADelt 41 Chr, 90-4. The report of the late P. Lazarides on his work in 1989 is published in PAE, 159-68. Nike 11.7.92 (et al.) report the find of a HL theature E of the acropolis. Platanidia. Excavations in 1985 reported by A. Ntina near Ano Lechonia, Volos, brought to light two ECh basilicas (ADelt 40 Chr, 221-3). Basilica A is three-aisled, and partially covered by the sea, but parts of the apse, N stylobate, mosaic floor, narthex and adjoining structures to the N are visible. Painted decoration adorned the walls, fragments of which were uncovered. A perforated closure panel with foliate decoration was also found. Estimated dimensions of the basilica: 23m long and 11.50m wide; its date may be late 4th/early 5th Ct. Basilica B is 85m W of A, and partly under water (about 30m long, 14.20m wide, with a narthex 3.30m wide); provi- sional date: 2nd half of 4th Ct. The sanctuary was covered with a geometric mosaic floor, but the area was later covered by an interesting small MByz quatrefoil church (int. dimensions 6.25 x 4.60m). At each springing of the apses was a single column or pier which supported the dome. Wall-painting fragments point to its having been decorated. Cist and pit graves were found nearby, suggesting that this was the cemetery church of the Byz settlement. Prodromos (AR 1991-92, 39). More work was carried out in 1985 on the 6th-5th Ct BC cemetery. The graves are mainly tile but with some pithoi and urns. (ADelt 40 Chr, 196) Sesklo. Digging of a trench by the telephone company some distance N-NE of the site brought to light a layer 1.20m deep of MN pottery and figurines over virgin soil, but no architec- ture. This is probably the result of the restricted nature of the trench but recalls a trial by D. Theochares at a similar distance from the acropolis. It may be assumed that the central site was surrounded by a large town. (ADelt 40 Chr, 182-4) Skiathos. It is reported that development has caused much damage to the antiquities of this island (particularly in the main town where the anc. city lies under the mod.) as no permanent guard had been stationed there. In 1985 the presence of a specially appointed guard allowed some rescue work, notably on the NE of the town where structures of the 4th Ct BC, of typical construction built on the natural rock came to light. A R tomb, disturbed but with some finds, was also noted. (ADelt 40 Chr, 193-4) Skopelos. The presence of a special guard in 1985 allowed several areas of anc. building to be saved. NW of the town at Potamoi a well-built LR structure came to light with amphoras and pithoi, probably a storage or workshop complex. (ADelt 40 Chr, 194) Volos. A.

In particular the listing of sites in the hitherto almost unknown area of Eurytania was carried out, with very welcome assist- ance from the Nomarch. New sites of importance are noted at: Ag. Elaia Granitsas, Ag. Triada (a cave with figurines and other dedications), Salomnemata Lepionon, Tsouka and Paliokastro Palaiokatounas, and Tsouma Lemeriou; excava- tion of a visible cist grave at Daphnoulas produced no dating evidence.

Building remains were excavated in the middle of the S slope of the hill of the anc. acropolis: the oldest (?4th Ct BC) was a N-S wall on virgin soil; this was plastered, follow- ing repairs with tiles after destruction and appears to have been a passage between two buildings; two rooms of the latest structure were found, of carelessly built masonry. The site was in use from the mid 4th Ct BC to LR. (ADelt 40 Chr, 167-9) Atalante. At Paleomagazia (on the shore where finds were known from the sea) a mosaic with geometric motives from a LR/ECh bath complex came to light and was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Byz Ephorate. (ADelt 40 Chr, 167) At Bodobatsa ten LPG tombs were excavated, seven cists, two sarcophagi and one pithos. All were placed in pits in the rock and only two had been disturbed. They were rich in finds inside the graves with the exception of the children's burials which had no offerings but were accompanied by pots outside the grave. (ADelt 40 Chr, 165-7)</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 49 In 1986 three rescue excavations were carried out in or near the town. On Kokkola and Ethnikis Antistaseos a LR villa was found in which a well preserved apsed triclinium had a mosaic floor with geometric and plant designs and marble slabs around the apse. At the S edge of the same plot, at a level higher than the villa, was a largely disturbed cist tomb containing, inexplic- ably, a PG jug. A R cistern came to light on Aik. Soultanop- oulou in the area of the central plateia and at These Makedon- ika on the NE outskirts a handsome 90m section of the HL fortifications (previously unknown) with tower and indenta- tions. Two R tombs show that it had gone out of use by this period. (ADelt 41 Chr, 62-4) Bardates. On the E/SE edge of the village, lV2km from Neo Krikello, testing to a depth of 5m was carried out on a tumulus-like protrusion following clandestine excavation on the site. It proved to be only a stone pile in spite of having been listed in various authorities as a definite tumulus. (ADelt 41 Chr, 65) Bathykoilo: Skete. A low magoula was identified with much surface N pottery; testing produced walls and a cist grave of MN date. The site has been listed. (ADelt 41 Chr, 64) Domokos. Opposite the gymnasium at the foot of the acropolis a HL ChT was largely destroyed during building. It may be compared with the type known from Verroia containing benches for the burials and a wide selection of pottery and metal objects. It was in use from the end of the 3rd to the 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 40 Chr, 170-1) Elateia: Alonaki (AR 1985-86, 42; 1989-90, 47). The identifi- cation of the ChT cemetery NW of the acropolis, following clandestine excavation, is reported in 1985 when four tombs were investigated. They are LH IIIC, but in TIV a SMyc/PG burial had been inserted with burnt bones, two pairs of pins and an amphora. (ADelt 40 Chr, 171) A further 11 tombs were cleared in 1986 of which nine were Myc and two R tile graves. TXI had been used later as the base for a kiln. (ADelt 41 Chr, 65-8) At Kalogerou (or Koumoula Pyrgaki) NE of the village, tests following clandestine excavation revealed a large HL structure (AR 1986-87, 25) built in eight alternating courses of headers and stretchers 11 x 11.10m, forming the below-surface foundation of what was presumably a heroon. There was no associated surface sherd but a burnt layer (?from a foundation sacrifice) contained metal objects and HL sherds. (ADelt 41 Chr, 65) Recent work is noted in Archaiologia 45, 20-22. Glyfa: Fanos (AR 1986-87, 26). Clandestine excavation in the cemetery of anc. Antrona (of which the fortifications are known) led to the clearing of 34 small pit graves, one stone sarcophagus, two cremations and five pyres. The finds were in remarkably good condition. Two graves were R, the others LC to EHL. (ADelt 41 Chr, 74) Golemi. At Ag. Georgios by the road to Kalapodi a previously unknown Myc ChT cemetery came to light following clandes- tine excavation. Two tombs were cleared; an LH II/IIIA1 alabastron is illustrated. (ADelt 40 Chr, 169-70) Halai. A third season of excavations at Halai took place in 1992. Professor Coleman (ASCS) reports: "Work took place on the acropolis in areas A, C, F, G and H. Neolithic: Five new trenches were excavated in area F (F7- Fl11). Trenches F5-F8 were subsequently combined and designated F101. One trench, F9, comprised the re-excavation of the large trench previously excavated by the Goldman expedition in 1931. This was cleared of the debris that had accumulated since then and a new sounding was made in Goldman's 'House C' (our room 11). The results generally confirmed the findings of the earlier excavations, as recorded in the notebook of Virginia Grace. By the end of the season all trenches in area F except Fl were linked to one another, giving a total area of N exposure of more than 200m2. Levels undisturbed by human activity ("stereo') were reached in F2 and our excavations have therefore produced a reasonably complete sampling of the N sequence as it survives at Halai. The earliest finds are EN but probably do not date to the beginning of the period, since painted ware is evidently present, along with black burnished and mottled monochrome ('variegated') wares, in the lowest levels. The initial occupation of the site can thus be dated about 6000 BC. The EN levels are followed by extensive deposits of MN, although the transition between E and MN cannot be closely fixed until the pottery has been studied in detail. Architectural remains of both E and MN comprise wall socles of small to medium-sized stones which must have had mud-brick superstructures, to judge by the abundance of debris from disintegrated mud-bricks. White mud-plaster floors also occur. There is much Red-on-White painted pottery in the MN deposits, some of it resembling that of the Sesklo sequence in Thessaly. As noted in previous campaigns, LN I levels are also present in abundance. Initial stratigraphic observations suggest that the transition between M and LN may have occurred about the time that a gray layer was deposited over an extensive area. LN architecture was generally similar to that of the earlier periods. A massive structure of stones, perhaps a bounding wall, was built in LN times not long before the abandonment of the N town. If it was a delimiting wall, the area of the settlement must have been considerably reduced from what it had been earlier. Initial study of the pottery suggests that the site was abandoned during the first stage ('Tsangli-Larissa') of LN I, ca. 5000 BC. Twelve samples of carbonized material from various points in the N sequence presently await permission for export to the USA for radiocarbon analysis. One hundred and seven pottery samples also await an export permit for petrographic and NNA (at Cornell's Ward Laboratory of Nuclear Engineering). Archaic: In area A a new trench, A5, immediately adjacent to the NE side of A4, revealed the NW end of a large rec- tangular room (room 17). At least ten courses of mud-bricks remain in place above the stone socle of its NW wall near the W corer of the room. This extraordinary state of preservation can probably be attributed to the continued use of the room while floor/use level gradually rose as much as a metre or more. The stratigraphy, showing regular, horizontal Jayers of clay-like material, sometimes with vertical divisions, suggests that the room may have been in use for the preparation and drying of mud-brick. At the N corer of the room, in the uppermost levels of the use deposit, three slabs of stone are set on edge to create two receptacles, each roughly the size of a mud-brick. The receptacles were possibly used as moulds for mud-bricks, or as standards against which moulds could be checked. A group of amphoras found in the room adjacent to the NE side of room 17 suggests that the building was in use before the end of the 7th Ct BC. Further digging in trench A3 revealed details of the circular platforms mentioned in previous reports. One of them was</page><page sequence="48">50 E.B. FRENCH covered with a layer of 'turkey wing' shells (arca occident- alis), carefully bedded in clay. The use of the platforms remains a mystery. The interpretation previously suggested that they might have been the bases for granaries, now seems unlikely, since almost no traces of organic material was found on or around them. No evidence has been found that they were of a religious character. Perhaps they are connected with the manufacture of mud-bricks in the adjacent building. The new finds in area A now suggest that our earlier interpretation of this part of the acropolis as a residential area may have been in error, since the buildings and structures now seem more appropriate for public rather than private use. Hellenistic: Almost no material from the 5th or 4th Cts BC has been recovered from the acropolis at Halai by our expedi- tion, although excavations this year in area C in and beside the main NW-SE road that subdivides the acropolis suggest that it may have continued to be used during these centuries. The HL period, on the other hand, was clearly a very extensive one, although it has been a continuing problem for our expedition to distinguish the HL remains stratigraphically from those of the subsequent R era. Trench C1, near the centre of the acropolis, has now produced an extensive deposit of pottery and other household artifacts, almost all of which probably predates the destruction of the town by Sulla in 85 BC. In trench H8, on the other side of the main NW-SE road, a newly excavated room (room 16) is probably filled with HL material dating to the time of its use and subsequent destruction; the walls of the room were encountered almost immediately beneath the mod. surface and no significant traces of occupa- tion in R times are evident. It appears from the evidence just cited that occupation in the R period may have been less extensive than we had originally thought, and that the cross street and may of the buildings in areas C and H were first used in the HL period. Late Roman: No layers of E and MR date have yet been distinguished and stray finds from those phases are very scanty. In LR times (350-650 AD) and in particular during the 5th and 6th Cts, on the other hand, there was extensive activity at the site, although the discovery in 1992 of two tombs of that date in area H now raise the question of whether this activity was primarily religious rather than domestic. One of the tombs was the tile-covered burial of a child without offerings, probably datable to the 5th or 6th Ct. The other, more important, was a keel-vaulted built tomb with interior dimensions of ca. 2.37 x 2.20m; the maximum height is about 1.37m and it has a floor paved with flat terracotta tiles. The tomb is flanked by long walls that evidently served to support the vault, and a mass of concrete was used to bind the exterior of the vault together. Entrance was gained by a dromos leading to a well-constructed doorway at the E end. Although the built tomb was rifled in antiquity, preliminary examination of the scattered bones suggests that it had contained the burials of at least 16 people. Fifteen lamps found in the dromos and two from the chamber are of the 5th or 6th Cts; almost all are decorated with Ch symbols. A single gold earring had also escaped the notice of the anc. looters. The tombs in area H probably postdate domestic occupation in at least the NW half of the acropolis. Since the built tomb is plausibly to be associated with the earlier Ch church in area G, some 30m distant, its early date suggests the possibility that the church itself also postdates domestic occupation on the acropolis. In other words, perhaps Christian worship began only after the abandonment of the town. In order to try to establish more accurately the chrono- logy of the church, we excavated a test trench (G2) within its nave and N aisle, near the apse. A mosaic floor was encoun- tered within the nave, about 0.30m beneath the mod. ground surface. By the end of the season we had established that the mosaic extends to the line of the colonnade on the N and passes into the apse, although its full dimensions remain uncertain. The mosaic comprises figured panels bordered by bands of guilloche patterns. It consists of small tesserae of artificial material as well as natural stone. Although the mosaic is somewhat fragmentary, the subjects of three figured panels can be identified: a bowl with birds within it, a swan, and, near the central axis of the church, an eagle with a halo. Preliminary study suggests that the mosaic is to be dated within the 6th Ct. The earlier church, which must originally have been long and narrow in plan and therefore must have extended consider- ably further toward the W than its walls are presently pre- served, clearly underwent several architectural phases, although the details of the phases and their chronology are still uncer- tain. We could find no floor level in the N aisle corresponding to that of the mosaic in the nave and the possibility exists that only the nave was in use in the latest period of the church. Continuing investigations by Demetrios Haniotes in the sea beside the acropolis have revealed several walls and structures. Further excavations are necessary before these can be accurate- ly interpreted but it is already clear that many structures belonging to the town of Halai are to be found submerged in the shallow water." (See also below under Malesina.) Anc. Herakleia. Two cist graves dating to the 2nd Ct BC came to light on the NE slopes of the hill on the left bank of the Asopos. (ADelt 41 Chr, 68) Kynos: Pyrgos Livanates. Systematic excavation of this known site (MH to LR) was initiated in 1985. A LR wall (with spolia) was found cutting a LH IIIC floor beneath which children had been buried in cists. Another LH IIIC level was found with storage pithoi covered by destruction debris. The deeper levels were not investigated. (ADelt 40 Chr, 173-4) In 1986, in addition to more work on these areas, other storage installations were found, some with grain and others in a burnt level; below them were circular storage pits with evidence of earthquake destruction, all dating to LH IIIC. (ADelt 41 Chr, 68-9) Kyparissi. A previously unknown site at the 138km mark of the national highway came to light through deep ploughing. Five sections of a R complex (?villa) were excavated: A had a destruction level with tiles and included two silos; B, F and A had destruction levels of two storeys while in E there was a tile floor. (ADelt 40 Chr, 174) Lamia. For 1985 five rescue excavations are reported (ADelt 40 Chr, 154-7). At Plateia Parkou and Xantzopoulou 3 areas of structures were investigated which can be interpreted in relation to material known from adjacent plots: foundations three courses high dating from LC to LHL; a complex of three rooms with corridors, including a hearth, from a domestic dwelling (finds included a reused marble capital); and a well-built poros wall. Similarly a plot on Ainianon produced not only a section of two walls with intervening roadway bearing a destruction level with tiles and burning, but also structures (with many small finds) of two phases, of which the earlier was the better built and better preserved. A destruction level can be dated to the 4th Ct BC in comparison with one from an adjacent plot (AR 1976-77, 38). On Leosthenous and Paliaiologou a wall of one course came</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 51 to light, using on one side blocks from a destroyed building; this may be part of the city wall. Tombs from the known HL cemetery came to light in two plots along Almanas: seven cist tombs in all, with typical quality offerings. In 1986 rescue excavation was carried out in seven areas (ADelt 41 Chr, 57-62). The city wall was found in two sections of sewerage trench on Othonos and on Thermopylon and in two other plots at Aberof 14 and at Baskare and Kallidromou. The wall is from 1.10 to 2.95m wide with isodomic faces and stone fill; stylistically it can be dated to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. The last is a new section of the city wall, the SW part. Tombs were found in two areas: in the sewerage trench on Thermopylon two HL tombs of the cemetery which was in use from the 3rd to 1st Cts BC came to light and nearby were four tombs in use from the 2nd half of the 4th Ct to the end of the 2nd Ct BC, three cists and one tile. An unusual find was made in an imported fill at Othonos 38, which included a pithos deposit with human and animal bones, as well as pottery and other material which can be dated from the late 3rd Ct BC to the 3rd Ct AD. On the Kastro the efforts of the Demos to tidy the area included work to turn the Ott barracks into an Archaeological Museum, constructing an open air theatre, a snack bar at the arsenal, and the organization of gardens etc. The Kastro is known to have been the acropolis of the anc. city and has well preserved Med and Post Byz fortifications. Walling dating back to the 5th Ct BC and to HL was already known, as was BA material (AR 1979-80, 39). Three areas proved of interest: houses, possibly Ott, by the roadway leading to the W gate, with a silo and a structure of unknown function; a previous test by the W wall of the barracks which was cleaned to test stratigraphy of the area to the rock; and the find of a wall beneath the large room of the barracks, relating to its wall, built with no mortar and accompanied by glazed wares. Lianokladi. The cutting of the road to Karpenesi revealed a cist grave with iron dagger and two burial jars with child bones. (ADelt 41 Chr, 75) Livanates. At Kokkinonyzes on the outskirts of the town in the area of a known C cemetery with burial pithoi (AR 1988-89, 48), five new tombs appeared and were excavated. The pithoi faced E and were closed with a slab or large sherd. Bones were found in three of them, together with pottery, figurines and metal objects dating to the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 41 Chr, 69) Malesina. At Lekona two ChTs were excavated; one had been robbed but neither had offerings and they cannot be dated. At Ag. Ioannes Theologos (anc. Halai) the quarry from which the building stone for the site originated was investi- gated following clandestine excavation. Interesting work traces were found. (ADelt 40 Chr, 169) Martino. Illegal deep ploughing brought to light walling and two small cisterns with circular sumps covered by a destruction level. To the W, on the slope, was an enclosure with coins dating from the 3rd Ct BC to 569/570 AD. (ADelt 40 Chr, 174-5) Megaplatanos. At Pr. Elias, by the radar station, the site guard reported a heap of worked blocks which on excavation proved to be part of a rectangular building of pseudoisodomic masonry on a small eminence, probably a small watch tower of known type of the coastal defences dating to the HL period (3rd-2nd Ct BC). Pottery finds were poor, largely domestic but including bg and a Megarian bowl. (ADelt 40 Chr, 175-6) At Sbentza (within the limits of this community) a cem- etery of LH III ChTs came to light through illicit excavation; six tombs were subsequently cleared. They are dug into the soft rock and have long keyhole dromoi. One had been robbed but good evidence was produced by the others. (ADelt 40 Chr, 178-9) Meziates (AR 1988-89, 49). A third Macedonian tomb came to light near the ones already known lkm outside the village. It had been robbed, but the two burial couches were preserved with some of the rich offerings (bronze nails, gold leaf from a wreath etc). It was in use from the 3rd Ct BC to R times. The land was to be expropriated and the tomb preserved. (ADelt 40 Chr, 159) Neo Monasteri (anc. Proerna). Four rescue excavations are reported for 1985 (ADelt 40 Chr, 178-9). SW of the acropolis in OT 22 a SMyc cist grave with two parallel skeletons was found; between the heads lay a one- handled pot and between the feet a matt-painted jug and a bronze bead. On the SE slopes of the acropolis two Myc cist graves with few sherds came to light. Some 700m W of the acropolis two well built rooms and traces of a third, with clay floor covered in one place by a destruction level, was found. All the moveable finds were domestic; from bg pottery the house dates to the mid 4th Ct BC and as it lies on virgin soil there was no earlier occupation in this area. In OT 10, 30m SE of the acropolis a Myc structure of three rooms with clay floors came to light (pottery and animal figurines). In 1986 an important find was made in OT 26, of a group of three EH apsidal houses. The plot lies some 240m S of Tapi and the buildings lay on virgin soil. Associated with them was a pebbled ?courtyard covered by a destruction level. Pottery of all periods (EH, MH, Myc, PG, G and C) as well as various small objects came to light, but the houses are definitely dated to EH. (ADelt 41 Chr, 69-70) Stylida. Five rescue excavations are reported for 1985. More usually, and unlike those reported from the previous year (AR 1991-92, 41), all produced evidence of domestic architecture of the 4th Ct BC with a clear destruction level marked by burning and tiles. In one plot on Karkale and Platonos the structures were on two terraced levels, while on Balaorite and 28th Oktobriou part of a bath complex came to light. (ADelt 40 Chr, 157-9) Syka Ypates.

The function of the site is not clear. Gavros: Palaiokastro/Kastri attracted attention by its name, and villagers led the team to a area at base of the rocks enclosed by a wall, with a possible tower at the NE. Some building remains are visible, very disturbed, and some scanty pottery. The site probably dates to Byz or Post Byz. Gavros: Loutro, again pointed out by villagers, lies some 2km N and is marked by large blocks and copious sherd evidence of HL and R date. It is suggested that this is a small open settlement near a well-built construction, possibly a shrine. Asprokklissia was revisited to determine its size; although there is no architectural evidence except on the top of the hill by the church, copious pottery for HL to Ott attests occupation. Ayiophyllo also has no architectural remains but survey of the fields below produced HL bg material. The implications of the settlement pattern of the region are under study. Epigraphic work has been carried by J.-C. Decourt who has completed the study of the 26 milestones (Augustus to 5th Ct AD) and by L. Darmezin who has conducted a new study of the inscriptions concerning the various anc. cities of the region N of the Peneus, including their whereabouts and their state of preservation. Grevena Project. The Project reports: "There were two aspects to the work of the Grevena Project during the 1992 season: study of the pottery and other finds by Professors Nancy Wilkie and John Rosser, and study of soil profiles at a number of our sites by our geologists, Professor Mary Savina and Richard Doyle. In 1992 Professor Rosser began his study of the R pottery. He was also able to refine his study of the EMed material, and now recognizes approximately 90 sites with material from that period. Professor Wilkie began her study of the BA material, but more work still needs to be done to better define the E, M and LBA components. Giorgos Toufexis of the Ephorate at Larisa joined the project for a few days to work with Wilkie on their joint study of the N material from Grevena. One result of the 1992 study was the recognition of a significant LN component at one of our sites, Asprokambos/Agia Paraskeue. Sherds from this period are otherwise noticeably lacking in our collection. The geologists worked at a total of 21 sites. The main part of their effort was the recording of soil profiles in an attempt to determine erosional patterns in the nomos of Grevena and to discover which, if any, of the sites we have located contain in situ, undisturbed deposits. Currently, fewer than ten of our approximately 390 sites fall into this category. Most but not all of the sites with in situ deposits were mapped either in 1991 or 1992; but additional work remains since the late grain harvest both years has impeded our access to a number of sites. Another aspect of the geologic work was the collection of samples for C14 dating from strata exposed in road cuts and other exposures, We now have samples for approximately 20 C,4 dates and they will be analyzed during the 1992-93 academic year." Larisa. A major discovery, of a second theatre, was made on Tagmatarchou Belessariou. During excavation the first assump- tion was that this was a hippodrome or stadium but as the work progressed it became clear that it was a theatre in addition to the one already known. Work on the site by mechanical means had resulted in the removal of many architectural members and a separate excavation was carried out on the dump to retrieve them. Nine rows were found, with two rows of built seats, and 14 sets of steps. Various building refinements were noted. The stage building was constructed of reused blocks many of them bearing 3rd-2nd Ct BC emancipation inscriptions. It would seem that this theatre was started in the 1st Ct BC and never finished; only the orchestra and skene were completed, and not the cavea. Systematic excavation was also restarted on the theatre on the Phrourio which has had a long history of sporadic clear- ance. A long test trench was dug N-S from the top of the cavea through the skene which gave evidence of the diazoma (marble, as were the seats) and various construction refine- ments. The area of the former army bakery and another expropriated plot were excavated, revealing a section of the cavea and of the skene respectively. The seats are covered with inscriptions of the 2nd Ct AD which give crucial information about the population of Larisa at that time. Important evidence of the construction was recovered. One storey of the skene is preserved and there may have been another; the W section of two rooms (from a total length of some 19.5m) with corridor between, is well preserved. In front of this was the Charoneian stairway. A pillar base for the proscenium was preserved, as well as evidence for half columns in the W room; here the slab floor has four round holes for the wooden base to an upper section. Construction of the theatre is dated to the 3rd Ct BC, the time of Philip V of Macedon. (ADelt 40 Chr, 198-202) The final stages of work on this theatre (AR 1991-92, 42) are reported in Eleutheros Typos 20.6.92 and more details are given in Nea 29.1.93. Excavations in 1985 at Ioustinianou 55 reported by S. Choulias brought to light a ChT with lead sarcophagus, 1.60 x .40 x .50m. Excavations on Garibaldi and Olympou brought to light remains of a R bath house (coin of 218-22) with extensive mosaic floor decoration, mostly fragmentary. (ADelt 40 Chr, 216) Ambelokypoi. The find of a two-storey 3rd Ct AD tomb is reported in Mesembrine 3.5.93; the two skeletons were facing one another and holding hands. The tomb can be assigned to the N cemetery of the town.

This has four pillars on the W and is divided into rooms. It is suggested that this structure is part of the agora complex, the main section of which lies some 150m to the S. Evidence for iron and bronze working and pottery manufacture was found; in a later phase one room contained a kiln. (ADelt 40 Chr, 202) Sykourio.

As almost all the section E of the church of Ag. Nikolaos in the centre of the town, in the area known as the Asklepeion, had been expropriated, systematic excavation was initiated. Previous work had revealed a R bath complex and a large HL structure (probably a stoa) with 2nd Ct AD mosaics (the so-called Asklepeion). Tests were made in an attempt to trace a HL pillared stoa known from rescue work in 1976. This proved to turn N and is thought to be related to the large structure. (ADelt 40 Chr, 202-5 with plan) A small three-aisled Byz church was found which was cleared by the 7th Byz Ephorate. (ADelt 40 Chr, 209) A discussion of the Byz coins of the town and their relation to Byz history is published by A. Kyparisse-Apostolika in Trikalina 12, 139-162. Trikala area. The late E. Ioannidakes reported the cem- etery church of Ag. Georgios at Basilike, of 14th-15th Ct foundation and a fine example of a three-aisled basilica with raised nave, and three conches to the E. Pseudoisodomic cloisonn6 masonry was used for the E apses, and dog-tooth frets and brick ornamentation decorate the masonry. 17th Ct wall-paintings of exceptional quality cover the interior. (ADelt 40 Chr, 209-10) Ioannidakes also reported further excavations of a basilica uncovered at the site of the so-called Asklepeion (ADelt 31 Chr, 179, n.1). The three E apses (total length 9.80m) and part of the N wall were uncovered, along with sections of the two walls that separated the aisles from each other, and which may have supported the colonnades. Masonry consists of roughly hewn blocks, tiles and mortar, with HL and LR spolia. Finds include many phases of Byz and Post Byz pottery, clay tripod firing supports, fragments of wall-painting, bronze objects etc. The structure may be identified with the important 10th Ct monastery of Ag. Nikolaos, a metochion of Ag. Georgios mon- astery at Zavlantia (AR 1991-92, 41). (ADelt 40 Chr, 210-1) D.

CENTRAL MACEDONIA (16th Ephorate) The Ephorate reports for both 1985 (ADelt 40 Chr, 232-44) and 1986 (ADelt 41 Chr, 131-51). In the former the rearrange- ment and extension of the Thessalonike Museum for the celebration of the 2300rd anniversary of the founding of the city is given pride of place (ADelt 40 Chr, 232). Other general information concerns chance finds gathered by the various museums, including a number of HL and R grave stelai (one inscribed OYAAEnOYAHZ ITPATIQTHX OYAAEIOYAEN TO YIO MNHMHI XAPIN) and scientific work undertaken for the Thessalonike Museum on pottery, glass and ceramics (ADelt 40 Chr, 238-9, 244). For 1986 the chance finds are reported in ADelt 41 Chr, 150 and the scientific work (pottery and plaster) in ADelt 41 Chr, 150-1. Various accounts of work going on in Macedonia appeared during the summer and early autumn (Ta Nea 4.8.92, Avriane 8.10.92, Thessalonike 26.10.92, Ellenikos Borras 22.11.92) and accounts of the winter presentations of the year's work are given in Kathemerine and Eleutheros Typos 12.2.93 and Ellenikos Borras 21.2.93. Ag. Paraskeue. Two further years' work on this important A cemetery (wrongly listed under Chalkidike in AR 1991-92, 42) are briefly reported in ADelt 40 Chr, 235 and ADelt 41 Chr, 138-9. A further 123 tombs were cleared in 1985 and 59 in 1986, bringing the total to 435. The male burials are accom- panied by weapons, the female by jewellery and both by pottery-Attic, Cor and E Gr (Cover) as well as local wares. Work started in 1985 and continued in 1986 on the 'trapeza', Toumba Angelake, where the settlement lies; a C rectangular building was found overlying an A deposit with much pottery, totally comparable with that from the cemetery. Ano Toumba. Rescue work by the Ephorate on building plots lying on the 'trapeza' surrounding the PR toumba in the outskirts of Thessalonike is reported from two areas. At Elaias 10 five A pithoi were found, with unpainted pottery, shells, bones of small animals and Attic bf (some with added white); in lower levels was a round baked clay pit with burnt fill of the EIA. (ADelt 40 Chr, 233-4) On Ortensias 6 and 4, the basic stratigraphy of the area was again in evidence, extending from scattered PR material washed down from the toumba to settlement of the EIA through A and 5th Ct BC to the 4th Ct BC when the site was abandoned; the evidence is of roadways and of domestic architecture with domestic artifacts (including those of textile manufacture). (ADelt 40 Chr, 233-5; ADelt 41 Chr, 134-5) Four reports on work here are published in AEMTH 4 (1990): G. Chourmouziades on the Near Eastern system of imports (269-75); reports on work of the University team in 1990 on the sides of the toumba (277-87) and on the top (289- 97); K. Soueref on the Ephorate's work on the outer area (299- 313). The information that only 5.5% of the Myc pottery from the recent excavations on the site is not local was presented at the winter conference and reported by Nea 12.2.93 et al. Askos. A toumba was reported by a villager 2km along the road to Anoixia; it had been robbed but LBA and EIA material was retrieved. Axiochori (Kilkis). The chance find of a cemetery (of war- riors?), with rich finds but as yet no bones, is reported in Nike 4.11.92; two tombs have been excavated, one of 7th/6th Ct BC and the other 4th/3rd Ct BC. Basilika: Trachaniotikos Lakkos, A further 15 LR tombs (two pit, three covered pits, seven tiled, plus one with crema- tion, and three cists, one of which contained many burials) are reported; finds include pottery, glass and coins.

A further 220 tombs in 256m2 were excavated in 1985 from the cemetery of anc. Akanthos; they were similar to those already cleared and dated from C to EHL with a few A. The children's tombs were rich in finds (especially figurines and miniature pots but also jewellery) while the adults had few offerings. There were also some imported amphoras and a Clazomenian decorated larax. Other tombs lay on the edge of the cemetery and dated from LC and HL. In 1986 another 533 tombs were dug in an area of 230m2, much the densest concentration yet. They were of known types but the majority were plain. At the NE edge of the cemetery, however, only eight 4th Ct tombs were found. In the main area the 4th and early 3rd Ct tombs were pits and urns (containing some 241 vessels) with few larnakes and pithoi. In each year a further example of a burial where the feet had been bound with iron chains came to light, making a total of nine out of 4,000 burials; in 1985 another burial appeared to be that of a horse and its rider, while in 1986 a rare find was made of two</page><page sequence="52">54 E.B. FRENCH FIG. 36 tombs with iron weapons. Finds were generally domestic pot- tery and the odd coin. One hundred tombs of the overlying Byz cemetery were excavated and found to be of a completely dif- ferent orientation. (ADelt 40 Chr, 237; ADelt 41 Chr, 149-50) Kalandras, anc. Mende. Trial excavations in three areas in 1986 are reported. In the 'proasteio', structures revealed by sea-erosion were investigated and produced 6th Ct BC pottery and older EA foundations as well as a destruction layer of the 4th Ct BC with Attic bg ware. The same phases appeared in another trial in the same area; the destruction can be linked to the Macedonian attacks of 356 or 348 BC. Inside the walls a 4th Ct BC house with paved court, drain, clay bath and stone cistern (presumably the bath complex of a rich private house) was found. Broken pottery and coins in the destruction layer are again of the 4th Ct BC. At Bigla, the high ground at the SE edge of the site, which presumably formed the anc. acropolis, failed to produce the expected fortifications, thanks to devasting erosion and stone robbing, but instead a G wall was found around the summit. The very shallow deposit produced C, A, G and handmade wares but little stone, though it is not clear whether this is because of quarrying or because the structures had been of mud-brick. There was also a series of elaborate pits which were filled with debris from the G settlement, presumably deposited in them in the 7th Ct BC. Some 10% of the pottery was a typical handmade domestic ware, accompanied by LG imports, especially Rhodian, E Gr and from Eretria; there was some wheelmade grey ware as well as earlier material (LH and SMyc with local imitations and PG both local and imported). This will give important evidence both for the foundation of the colony and the origin of the settlers. (ADelt 41 Chr, 147-9) In AEMTH 4 (1990) 399-410 I.

Vokotopoulou) and the University of Tasmania (J. Carington Smith) took place on this EIA hill-top site in June 1992. On behalf of the collaboration, J. Carington Smith reports: "A short season confined to the settlement located the exterior S wall of the large building referred to in previous reports. The building continued W beyond the excavation's limits. Sherds and stone tools were the only finds from it, and its purpose remains unknown. Just outside the building's N wall, an EIA pithos with stone lid in situ was set in the side of a deep hollow in the bedrock (Fig. 36). Near this were scattered many fragments of a soapstone mould and small lumps of burnt clay. One side of the mould had been for casting blades, one of which had a tang or handle; the other side had matrices for three roughly pointed billets or rods (Fig. 37). The settlement's unusually numerous pebble pounder/ grinders could well be connected with metal-working. There are two disused mines within 5kms of the site, and according to the 1978 IGME map, these are the only ore outcrops in the Sithonia sub-peninsula; one has galena/copper and the other galena/iron pyrites".

Papamarinopoulos of Patras University continued in 1992. Its purpose was to test the efficiency of equipment modified in the light of last year's experience, and to continue and extend work carried out then, beginning with a surface exploration of the main features of the canal, such as its width and depth at various points along it. Georadar measurements were taken along six traverses ranging in length from 50 to 250m, at various points along the canal between the 'lobby' kentron near the S end at Tripiti, and the cemetery at Nea Roda near the N end. Some of the traverses coincided with those examined last year. In addition, electrical soundings were made to a depth of approximately 50m at a point roughly midway along the canal. The situation appears again to be clearest in this neighbourhood, where a large sloping feature is already apparent, resembling what was found in 1991. Further N, near Nea Roda, many data were gathered in order to determine, if possible, whether the canal crossed the lagoon which formerly existed hereabouts or not. Until full computer processing of these data has been applied, the question cannot be answered. Near the 'lobby' not far from the S end of the canal, georadar testing suggests that the canal was present also in at least part of the level ground where no surface indications of its presence exist. As against this, recent forest fires which have removed the impenetrable vegetation which once made impossible detailed investigation of the bed of the little river assumed to have formed the final stretch of the canal, and revealed a chaotic terrain. The geomorphological condition of the Tripiti end is obscure, and will require special attention. Nea Skione: Mytika (3km E/SE of the town by the sea where anc. Skione has been tentatively placed). Here ten trial trenches produced a mass of Laconian tile and a pit with building rubbish from a public building destroyed in the 4th Ct BC destruction. Nea Syllata: Toumba Beria.

There are three reports of work in 1985. At Mylos, 2km S of the town, a small-scale excavation brought to light two HL cist tombs which, though robbed, still produced bg pottery both in and out of the graves and, some 300m to the SE, a section of the S wall of Potidaia, or more probably of Kassandreia. In plot 198, 200m SSW of the town, a find of architectural marbles led to rescue work. The marbles, of the 4th Ct BC, must come from a temple or public building. Above this was evidence of HL occupation and above that two R occupation phases of the 3rd/4th Ct AD with a burnt destruc- tion layer between them. (ADelt 40 Chr, 237-8) In 1986 three trial excavations were carried out. At Petrio- tika, S of the town and immediately WNW of the Macedonian tomb (AR 1991-92, 44), four 4th Ct BC tombs were found, two cists of children, robbed in antiquity, and two sarcophagi. One of the latter, in good condition, was of a rich girl and the other a large one with relief decoration and important finds. Most important of all is the relation to the Macedonian tomb. At Malta, lkm S, a HL structure and a refuse pit with amphoras was found. At Ampelotopos, 200m N of the mod. canal, a 110m stretch of the N wall of the C town was cleared.

Work started in 1982 (AR 1990-91, 52) on the cemetery was continued with the hope of defining the extent.

Some 3km S of the village at Ypsomata or Ntabas, two LA tombs were found, one with a typical monolithic poros sarcophagus, the other with a cist; both were typical rich male burials. The site may be the cemetery for anc. Ichnoi, ident- ified with the 'trapeza' 400m to the S. (ADelt 40 Chr, 235) A R head from the site was handed in to the museum in 1986.

In the first a C house with rooms adjoining a courtyard and bordered by a roadway was found; below lay A rubbish pits and above HL and R remains with Byz on the surface. The other produced only two rubbish pits with 5th Ct BC pottery, indicating the small extent of the settlement at this period. (ADelt 40 Chr, 238) In 1986 there was work in four plots and along a water channel (AR 1988-89, 68). The latter traversed the N cemetery with 11 tombs of the 5th-4th Cts BC. The plots revealed a R tomb of reused stone, two pit graves of children in wooden sarcophagi dating from the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC, with typical finds, and occupation levels of Byz, R, HL and 4th Ct BC, but not earlier, as this section seems then to have been a roadway. The fourth area (where the Byz Ephorate had excavated in 1985) proved more important, for, as well as typical occupation levels (C to Byz), part of the S wall of Pydna came to light. It was built of unbaked brick, using stone foundations only where there was a water problem, and with a ditch outside. This was filled with 5th Ct pottery and waste from iron and bronze working. It may be noted that the 4th Ct BC settlement extended further S. (ADelt 41 Chr, 143-4) In AEMTH 4 (1990) the work in 1990 on plot 575 is published by E. Marke (247-58) and M.

Here local water works had destroyed HL, R and Byz tombs but it was possible to recover much pottery. A group of rich tombs of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC was excavated, though they had been robbed already by R times, as well as five R tombs. In these one burial had 12 coins on the chest and towards the right hand, and rings of silver and iron, while another had 14 coins similarly placed. Other finds included four Post Byz tombs, a LR pottery kiln with pieces of a R Ionic building in reuse. (ADelt 41 Chr, 142-3) Olympos. The first ADelt reports of the work at Ag. Demetr- ios: Xerolakkos or Spathes have now appeared and give the background to this important site. In 1985, following the destruction of some five tombs during the building of a forestry road, another five were excavated and the whole area investi- gated. The tombs are well-built cists of plastered slabs and are well preserved; this first group contained pottery of LH IIIC as well as local handmade pottery, jewellery and small weapons. (ADelt 40 Chr, 238, 243) In 1986 another eight tombs were excavated, containing 11 burials (but with other bones on top). The pottery can be dated to LH IIIB-C and the personal goods are differentiated by sex, with little given to the men. Sealstones were found over the chest and are interpreted as amulets; notable too are conuli in both clay and stone. (ADelt 41 Chr, 140-1) E. Poulake-Pantermale discusses the region and its antiquities in Tome 301 5, 24-7. Leptokarya. A Myc tomb with small alabastron and knife was found in the regional survey. (ADelt 40 Chr, 240-43) Survey. E. Pantermale gives a general account of the region and the survey which she carried out. Notable identifications included many EIA tumuli on the lower slopes of which four were excavated. The whole has been declared an archaeological area; it is of course already part of the long-standing national park. (ADelt 40 Chr, 240-3) Ossa Lankada. A survey on the hill called Kouri produced Byz, R and HL material with coins on the N slope near the top; lower down, by the path, there were walls and pithos sherds and on the NE and elsewhere there were circular structures. Testing revealed a church on the top with 4th Ct AD walls nearby and on the W slope a deposit of Aretine and terra sigillata as well as HL pottery. (ADelt 40 Chr, 236) Ossa: Toumba Kolokotrone (at Galena). A rescue excavation was carried out after the LBA settlement had been largely destroyed by treasure hunters. The site is difficult of access but has plentiful streams of good water running beside the base of the mound. Some evidence of walls with pottery and small finds was found in spite of the heavy disturbance. (ADelt 40 Chr, 236) Palaio Gynaikokastro (AR 1991-92, 45). A further cist tomb from the known EIA cemetery was excavated in 1985. (ADelt 40 Chr, 239) In 1986 work was done on an extensive area with 200 urns, cists and burials. The urns were covered with other pots or with slabs and were local products of various shapes. There were offerings inside including jewellery and knives, differenti- ated by sex. Parts of two burial enclosures and a cremation area were also found. In addition there was a R cist with a lamp and a glass vial, six other tombs without offerings and ten empty tombs. (ADelt 41 Chr, 139) Work by the Ephorate in 1990 is reported in AEMTH 4 (1990) 333-42. Pieria. A feature on the area is published by Ena 18.11.92. Rentina. N. Moutsopoulos publishes an account of his work in 1989 in PAE 199-204. The Kathemerine Sunday supplement was devoted to this site on 23.5.93. Sebaste. In 1986 a survey followed by testing was carried out on the hill of the settlement. Previously known were N pottery and axes, HL and R pottery, an HL inscription and a Byz</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 57 cemetery and settlement. The survey produced pottery and small finds of various periods especially N to EBA; the testing proved the site to be N (pottery and chipped stone but no structures) with relations to Thessaly; a shell bracelet has relations to Sitagroi and the Balkans; a single marble figurine was found. (ADelt 41 Chr, 141-2) Toumba Pappa. The excavation already described (AR 1988-89, 68-9) is reported in ADelt 41 Chr, 144-5. Toumba Paionias. The find of three monumental tholos tombs is reported in Apogeumatine 2.9.92. Sindos (AR 1988-89, 69; 1989-90, 54; 1990-91, 53). In the grounds of the sewage plant by the river, two R children's tiled graves were found; each burial had two coins in the mouth and one had another coin in his left hand. (ADelt 40 Chr, 236-7) M. Tiberios publishes the results of the University's work on the double 'trapeza' (Anchialos) in 1990 in AEMTH 4 (1990) 315-32. Therme. In 1986 work was carried out in a plot E of the toumba and NE of the village. House remains were found in several areas, of uncertain date (though probably LA); two pits with bg pottery, lamps, loomweights, coins and a ?bracelet were also found. (ADelt 41 Chr, 138) Thessalonike. For 1985 reports of three rescue excavations are published. At Kassandrou 14-16 a mosaic depicting two fish was cleared, under an Ott overburden, from a structure which had later been reused as a cistern. Spolia included a 1st Ct AD inscription and a 2nd Ct AD female portrait. The mosaic was lifted to preserve it and excavation continued beneath, reveal- ing building information parallelled elsewhere in the area, and evidence of the E cemetery. Notable features were drains of the 1st Ct BC and a clay floor. (ADelt 40 Chr, 232-3) Also on Kassandrou, opposite the above, a LHL house came to light, with a well which had been used as a refuse pit in LR times. (ADelt 40 Chr, 233) A section of the walls with a R tower containing a large number of funerary altars was found at Melenikou 30. These, some of which are also carved, give important information on names of the 2nd Ct AD. (ADelt 40 Chr, 233) For 1986 there are five reports published. On Plateia Athonos the basement of a vaulted stoa, probably running all along the length of Augerinou, came to light. At its SE narrow end it abuts a similar earlier structure on the same alignment which was in-filled in reuse. A third building phase was identified at the SW, where there is a doorway and stair. This building lies close to the centre of the R town by the agora and may well belong to an already known public structure. It would appear to date from LR with reuse in ECh and Med. (ADelt 41 Chr, 131-2) On Ethnikis Amynes (formerly Bas. Sophias) part of the E cemetery with R tombs at a depth of 4-6m was excavated. There were various built cists, of both adults and children, incorporating some spolia; offerings included gold, iron and bronze. Both cremations and interments were present and some horizontal stratigraphy was noted. Above lay Byz remains, including a group of eight pithoi. (ADelt 41 Chr, 132-3) In a plot on Apellou, a further section of the LR Palace of Galerian was uncovered; above lay a LR drain, the walls of an ECh house with domestic pottery, glass, metal artifacts and painted plaster, and Byz pottery. (ADelt 41 Chr, 133-4) At Proxenon 134, below Ott and ECh material in the foundations of a structure being removed, was a R bath com- plex and evidence of yet earlier material. (ADelt 41 Chr, 134) At Demosthenous 16 a late antique tomb complex in a peribolos was cleared; the earlier phase dated from the 4th Ct AD, the second from slightly later in the same century. This forms part of the W cemetery; of particular interest are the public road by which it lies and the building on its E side. (ADelt 41 Chr, 134) Salvage excavation in the Plateia Dioiketeriou in 1990 is described by I. Kanonides in AEMTH 4 (1990) 259-267. The press have given their usual wide coverage to sites within the city and the 'scandal' of the building permission (now reversed Kathemerine 31.3.92 et al.) for the Stadium site on Apellou has been well aired (Ethnos 29.9.92 et passim). Kathemerine 27.11.92 publishes a heartfelt plea that the city be declared a historical monument to prevent further erosion of its past. The selection of the city as a forthcoming Cultural Capital of Europe will give a much needed impetus to conserv- ation. The following recent finds may be noted: 15 ECh tombs in the agora (Mesembrine 26.6.92); a section of R roadway (Kathemerine 22.7.92 et al.); important Byz remains on Egnatias (Eleutheros Typos 15.9.92); a section of the R E cemetery on Angelake on the site of the new IKA building (Eleutherotypia 17.11.92); a MByz complex in the Plateia Dioiketeriou (Auge 28.1.93); Byz and Post Byz workshops at Egnatias and Iasonidou (Thessalonike 17.2.93); more important R and earlier remains in Plateia Dioiketeriou and elsewhere in the city centre (with plan) (Thessalonike 19.3.93, 2.4.93); 14 4th Ct AD tombs (6 unrobbed) at Ampelokypoi (Nea 15.3.93); totally unexpected N remains under the International Fair Park (Nea 19.3.93). Kathemerine 25.4.93 features the underground churches of the city while the issue of 9.5.93 discusses the sculptures from the agora of Thessalonike now in the Louvre.

The Byz Kastron is located NW of Chryse. Excava- tions in 1985 reported by D. Eugenidou led to a tentative identification of the site (40 stremmata) with the fortified town of Moglena. At least three towers (6.5-8m high) and the S gate are discernible; the walls are about 2.45m thick. The prothesis and apse of a large church were discovered within the walls, with fragments of wall-painting and m9saic decoration and of a synthronon. (ADelt 40 Chr, 248-9) The 1986 season showed this church to be a three-aisled basilica 10.90m long with the N aisle 2.45m wide. Opus sectile work and marble revetment fragments were found in the area in front of the bema. The church seems to have been in use in the 10th-12th Ct (a trachy of the 11th Ct and contemporary marble relief decoration were found within), and it may have been the episcopal church of Moglena. Another smaller free-</page><page sequence="56">58 E.B. FRENCH cross plan church was encountered in the 1986 season outside the walls, to the S, and included ECh spolia for its floor. A burial N of the walls included a small iron cross and a fine (11th Ct?) bronze cross-reliquary with a crucified Christ on one side and the Virgin on the other. Nineteen other burials were encountered. (ADelt 41 Chr, 159-61) Edessa. A. Chrysostomou publishes the results of rescue excavation on the fortifications in 1990 in AEMTH 4 (1990) 155-67.

Petria. D. Eugenidou (ADelt 40 Chr, 250-1) and I. Kanonides (ADelt 41 Chr, 159) report on trial excavations in 1985 and 1986 at a site between the villages of Episkope (Nome of Emathia) and Petria (Nome of Pella). Walls of a structure with an E-W orientation, together with wall-painting fragments, coarse and glazed sherds, and even PR implements were found, indicating protracted settlement. Burials and wall-painting fragments point to an 11th Ct date for the Byz remains, and the name of the nearby village of Episkope may point to this having been an important ecclesiastical centre; an 11th Ct architectural member is included in the church at Petria. Oral tradition related the presence of a monastery here. Investiga- tions will continue, despite the disturbed stratigraphy. Prespa.

Eugenidou reports on work undertaken on the sanctuary area of the Old Metropolis the same year to establish the nature of the original templon screen, many fragments of which still exist. (ADelt 40 Chr, 253-4) Many wall-painting fragments of a Theotokos with two angels were located in the E part of the nave under the Ott floor. Two further floor levels were discovered below this. For 1986 K. Trochides reports on efforts to preserve the listed three-aisled basilica 'tou Soteros' with pitched timber roof, dated to 1606, and a fine example of ecclesiastical architecture of the time and region.

Kanonides reports on ECh cist graves found on OT 298 with some small finds (leather buttons decorated with spirals, a spear head, and in tomb T3, a glass censer of the 6th Ct). (ADelt 41 Chr, 156, 158) EASTERN MACEDONIA (18th Ephorate) A report on work on the Pal of the area in 1989-90 is given by G. Koutrese-Philippake (and colleagues) in AEMTH 4 (1990) 553-9. Presentations at the 1993 winter conference on archae- ological finds in the border area were reported widely on 13.2.93. Aedonochori (anc. Tragilos) (AR 1991-92, 53). Work con- tinued in 1985 on the cemetery, first on the large rectangular peribolos already recorded. It contained many tombs which antedate the peribolos. Three cists inside and two outside were cleared, containing single or double burials; all date to the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC. Some of the finds lay on top of the tombs; on the chests of males were iron implements of a type found throughout E Macedonia. In the area where previously disturbed C tombs had been found, 35 tombs in rows of various dates were cleared. There were cremations in local handmade vessels, with EIA objects of the 7th Ct BC, and cremations and burial urns of the 1st half of the 6th Ct, with local and imported pottery, and with E-W orientation, while the C tile and cist tombs have N-S orientation. These are mainly of children (rich burials) but with some adults in simple pits. Some 70m N a building previously recorded appears to be a funerary monument, but more work is required. A large building in a bad state, of three rooms bounded by a terrace wall, can be dated to the 4th Ct BC; its presence near the earlier cemetery shows that the city had expanded N (as well as W) by this period. Other tombs by the mod. road had been robbed early this century. (ADelt 40 Chr, 270-1) Work in 1990 is reported by M. Nikolaidou-Patera in AEMTH 4 (1990) 513-28. Amphipolis. Excavation was carried out in 1985 on a well- preserved, presumably public, R building. The facade and three areas on the E, each with an outer entrance, were cleared; walls and floors were plastered. The base of an honorific dedication to Menandro Neikolaou, a female statue, a female head and a seated Serapis were found; the latter probably indicates the function of the building. Much of the superstruc- ture was found fallen. Finds include R bronze coins, bone pins etc., lamps and some earlier material. Road widening yielded further sections of the cemetery and revealed three HL cist tombs containing clay tear bottles, bowls, iron implements, two bronze coins and a lamp. A child's grave contained five figurines, including two of Silenus and Cupid. Many coins and other small items were received by the Museum. (ADelt 40 Chr, 268-9) In 1986, with the completion of the Museum, work started to the N on the Heroon and 4th Ct BC complex; the later levels proved very disturbed. Excavation was to be continued. (ADelt 41 Chr, 177) Some 800 bronze and eight silver coins, three figurines, metal small finds and an inscribed stele were handed in to the Museum. (ADelt 41 Chr, 180) Ch. Bakirtzes publishes the results of his work in 1989 in PAE 216-221. In 1992 (Ergon, 73-5) he began work on the large secular building E of Basilica A which has been ident- ified as the Bishop's Palace. What came to light was a vast open cistern (48 x 43 x 48m) holding 2,200m3 and comparable with such features in Constantinople itself. The cistern lay in the upper part of the fortifications and collected water from the surrounding buildings; tests showed that it was made of brick with a thick cement facing. It sloped toward the NE thus indicating the direction of the town. It was later reduced to three smaller cisterns, probably covered, and the remaining area was used as workshops (kiln); finally the whole area was covered by patchy housing which contained handmade and rough pottery. All this took place within the ECh period and gives a summary history of the site in this period. K. Lazarides publishes an account of her work on the Gymnasium in 1989 in PAE 205-15.Nike 4 and 11.4.93 gives an account of the site in its Sunday Travel section. Amygdaleonas. Survey in 1986 noted a wall on the hill Basilake, with a tower; inside were pithoi and stone tumble, outside a kiln. The pottery can be dated to the 4th Ct BC. A large built well, dating earlier than the R period, was also noted. (ADelt 41 Chr, 179) Berge. During exploration of sites (A to R) mentioned in the sources on the W bank of the Strymon in anc. Bisaltia, two areas were investigated near this village: Paliochori with a large R area some 500m W of the village and Manousi to the S, where a C to R cemetery was already known. Here slab- covered C pit graves with rf and bg pottery and a late antique cist, all robbed, came to light. (ADelt 40 Chr, 271) Daphnoudi. During agricultural levelling in 1986 a Thracian funerary stele of the 3rd Ct AD with wreath and meniscus was found with an inscription: ETOYE.A.N.P.AAI/ XIOY.KOZIA- A-/ MEXTOY XAIPE/ XAIPE KAI XY HIAPO/ AITA. The stele had been reused as a cover slab of a LR tomb which was given a terminus post quem by coins of the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct AD. (ADelt 41 Chr, 178-9) Dikili Tash. Ch. Koukoule-Chrysanthake publishes an account of her work in 1989 in PAE 233-42. Drama. In the town in 1985 a 4th Ct BC cist tomb with typical finds came to light. (ADelt 40 Chr, 272) N. Zekos reports the important find of a door lintel with a MByz inscription from just E of the city. The inscription is important for the history of the city, recording the restoration of an unspecified monument under an emperor Michael and a Metropolitan of Phillipi. The original length of the lintel is estimated at 2.50m, thus indicating a large monument (fortifi- cation gate?). If this theory is correct, the original Byz walls of Drama must pre-date the repairs of the mid-9th Ct, the reign of Michael III (843-867) being preferred by the excavators. (ADelt 40 Chr, 281-2) Kokkinogeio: Maara Cave. The find of mamoth teeth of Upper Pal is reported by Eleutherotypia 27.10.92. Gazoros. Six pit tombs with coarse pottery came to light in 1985.

Nikolaos) exposed part of the R/ECh city wall on the W side of the R and Byz town, proving that outside the earlier walls another wall had been built toward the sea. The oppor- tunity to investigate this was followed up. An external ?tower was exposed and a 6th Ct AD cistern. In two tests on the inside, sherds dated from R through HL to C; one test revealed a drain. The stratigraphy of the area can be summarized: (i) on</page><page sequence="58">60 E.B. FRENCH the rock, sporadic C and HL material; (ii) buildings of unknown date; (iii) cist tombs, again undatable but with no offerings and therefore probably Byz (a handsome cross and some MByz pottery may be associated with this level); (iv) Early Ott wall of 1525 AD associated with the aqueduct and a strong tower on the outside (there was no occupation on the outside). (ADelt 41 Chr, 175-6) Kepia-Akrobouni (AR 1991-92, 52). The systematic excava- tion of this site where the shrine of the Hero Auloneite has been identified, began in 1985 on the four stone piles which mark the site. In pile 1 there were no structures, only rock cuttings and sculptural and architectural fragments. In pile 2, where most of the finds from the surface survey had been made, was found a building with two rooms and more pieces of the marble bench et al. Pile 3 contained a LR plastered wall and more fragments, whereas pile 4 contained the LR structure previously noted, which may be an exteral peribolos wall. Coin evidence dates the destruction to the time of Constantine and his successors (the pottery of this period is poorly known). A stratigraphic test proved usage starting in the lst/2nd Ct BC and continuing to the 4th Ct AD (on the pottery evidence). Graffiti appear on the rims and handles of the LHL material, mainly names. Worship is thus attested from the 2nd Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD with a positive renewal in the 2nd Ct AD. The hunter/rider hero appears with an altar, a dog, a tree with snake and often a boar. A series of small statues represent a nude young man with himation and animals; a panther skin shows a link to Dionysus, but there are also links to Herakles, Asklepios and others. Inscriptions include: [ 'Hpcovt A]ibXcoveiTi/[ ]ato) E)z%aptom1ptov and EtKcaoto OotI3i&amp;ov /"Hpov[t A]X3(oveiTl /E[X%]iv. Other typical finds are altars and small columns. It remains to determine whether the destruction, which seems systematic, should be assigned to a barbarian influx or to Theodosian iconoclastic influence. (ADelt 40 Chr, 263-6) The continuation of the work in 1990 is reported by Ch. Koukoule-Chrysanthake and D. Malamidou in AEMTH 4 (1990) 503-11. Mesolakkia (Pano Lakobikia). In 1985 inspection took place of this deserted village 15km NE of Palaiokome on Pangaion. Many robbed tombs were noted (but few sherds) of unknown date; other similar remains are known in the district. (ADelt 40 Chr, 270) Nea Kerdyllia (anc. Argilo). In 1986 damage from a water channel brought to light houses, architectural marbles, a rain water drain to the sea and A to C pottery. In the cemetery area three poros tombs were cleared: a 3rd Ct BC cist with good finds, a Macedonian tomb of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC with bed and rich offerings, though robbed, and another, robbed in R times, of the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 41 Chr, 177) At Eukarpias, S of the Byz tower, walls of a settlement extending to the river with a cemetery to the W was noted in survey in 1986. This may be associated with the Macedonian tombs excavated at Kastri in 1981 (AR 1989-90, 60). (ADelt 41 Chr, 180) At Kerdyllion, Nkrantiste, on the W bank of the Strymon amid the villages destroyed by German bombardment, excava- tion was carried out in the 6th/5th Ct BC site known since the 1920s. The S wall of the town with gate and built drain, destroyed in the 4th Ct BC, was cleared. A collection of funerary inscriptions, and stelai was made; one architectural block was inscribed with a group of five short parallel lines. (ADelt 41 Chr, 178) Nigrita: Therma. A cist tomb was destroyed in building work, datable to C from the finds. (ADelt 41 Chr, 178) Lochos. In 1986 an extensive cemetery was noted some 3km to the SW, with 150 robbed pit graves. The scarce pottery was no help in assigning a date. (ADelt 41 Chr, 180) (Anc.) Oisyme. Excavation between 1988 and 1990 is reported by Ch. Koukoule-Chrysanthake and A. Papanikolaou in AEMTH 4 (1990) 487-502. Orphani (AR 1991-92, 52). W of the tombs noted last year, in 1985 three more robbed tombs were found. One of them produced Thasian stamped amphoras outside and an iron strigil and two nails inside, and in another were ungentaria and nails; all date to the 3rd/2nd Ct BC. A sixth tomb was then found and excavated; it had contained a pyre and can be dated by the finds to the end of the 3rd Ct BC. The cemetery can be linked with the adjacent site at Kanoni. This site, identified in 1979, is either Pharge or Pergamos (mentioned by Herodotos). Much recent damage has been done to the site by local people and test excavation followed. Circular pits in the rock of A to LA date were found with much pottery of large size, including Attic bf kraters. It is suggested that the settlement was destroyed in the 1st half of the 5th Ct BC and that the pits were dug for the debris. Building levels of HL date were also found with only a few small finds. The site is thought to have been of economic importance (from the imported pottery) from A to R times. (ADelt 40 Chr, 266-7) Work on the site in 1990 is reported by M. Nikolaidou- Patera in AEMTH 4 (1990) 513-29. Philippoi. 1985 saw the start of systematic excavation where the theatre and the city wall adjoin, commencing at a marble archway. This was cleared and proved to be of the 2nd Ct AD but of unknown function, as the ground levels preclude its use as a passage in the theatre. Many of the fallen marble blocks from the supporting wall of the theatre were reused and bore R inscriptions with names; there was also a marble table for the market police. At a lower level traces of the C supporting wall were found. A number of sculptures from the area were taken to the Museum. (ADelt 40 Chr, 262-3) This work continued in 1986 when a tower was identified as the wall thickens; much fallen material from the wall and the theatre was cleared. Another marble arch was found at a higher level than the previous one, indicating stairs between them. The Latin numeral XII was carved on a block later reused. (ADelt 41 Chr, 176-7) E. Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou reports on her 1985 work on the Corkscrew Tower. (ADelt 40 Chr, 287-8) In the 1986 season excavations concentrated on the area W of the N entrance to the narthex, to establish its relationship with the tower. The existence of an atrium to the W was also determined. Trial soundings in the S aisle established that there was no second smaller stylobate there, in contrast to the N aisle. Since this is the case in basilica A also, the N aisle must have had some special functional use. (ADelt 41 Chr, 187) G. Gounares and G.

This important fortified town was founded by Andronikos III (1328-41) and played an important part in the civil war. Indications exist of earlier HL, R, LR and EByz occupation in the vicinity which may point to an identification of the site with Heracleia Sidicae. (ADelt 40 Chr, 280-1) FIG. 39 Terpne: Ag.

In 1985 two excavations are reported and also some chance finds. Near the Odeion three test trenches were opened and a rectangular structure with associated well found. The upper stratigraphy had been disturbed in WWII but the destruction level was well preserved and can be assigned to the A period, 2nd half of the 6th Ct BC. Pottery was local, with Attic bf and East Gr. In the other excavation there was another rectangular structure and a deposit of 4th Ct stamped amphoras; pottery dated from R back to the 4th Ct. There was also a R structure. Chance finds included a disturbed cist grave with at least nine burials but no pottery inside and one R coin outside; a 4th Ct amphora; a male statue; a R relief and other items. (ADelt 40 Chr, 256-60) From 1986 two rescue excavations are reported. A test below the acropolis disclosed a building of the 1st half of the 4th to the early 3rd Ct BC though it could not be fully excavated because of the olive trees. By the Seilenos Gate work on a 4th Ct BC structure with pottery was continued. Outside the anc. town at Marmaromantra two distinct F- shaped complexes were disclosed: one with six rooms, a court, evidence from stairs for a second storey, an entrance to the large room at the comer and an outer court; the other complex was for workshop or storage use, again with outer court. This was partially a terrace, partially rock cut; six pithoi and an end room with wine press give evidence of function; finds include coins, inscribed amphora handles and date the structure to the 4th Ct BC. In the cemetery water works revealed a cist and a child's cist, both R. (ADelt 41 Chr, 168-71) The work of the French School in 1990 is reported by T. Kozelj in AEMTH 4 (1990) 547-52. Work was carried out by the French School in two areas in 1992. Y. Grandjean and F. Salviat with the architect M. Wurch-Kozelj studied the city wall and the sanctuary of Athena in preparation for the forthcoming publication. The line of the wall was traced both at the edge of the Sanctuary and in the depression between the sanctuary and the Pythion. In the middle of this depression Med installations occupy what is probably a gateway. Near the foundation of the temple of Athena, a most unusual segment of the wall (Fig. 38) was studied with care. It consists of reused blocks from the krepis of the temple; similar blocks were used in the Med fortress. From them the temple of Athena, built in the 5th Ct BC, can reconstructed as having three courses in the socle with rebate below. The destruction of the temple is dated by the writing of a graffito on the bedding of a block to c. 400 BC (see J. Pouilloux, Recherches sur l'histoire de les cultes de Thasos, 1954, p.28 n.4). F. Blonde, J.-Y. Marc, A. Muller and D. Mulliez worked on the area NE of the agora where excavation had been carried out between 1979 and 1986. A series of tests were made in advance of final publication in three sectors. By the passage of the Theoroi the intention was to establish both the strati- graphic relation between the passage and the other levels already noted and the architectural relation to the agora. Three trenches at right angles to the passage were planned, at either end and in the centre, of which the first two were completed in 1992. At the N end a series of thick sandy fills was encoun- tered of which the latest was cut by two drains and by the R paving of the passage. Below the fills the facing of a thick but very irregular NW-SE wall preserved to 1.10m came to light (Fig. 39). At the S completely different stratigraphy was</page><page sequence="60">62 E.B. FRENCH FIG. 40 encountered. Below mod. excavation fills, there was a fill of horizontal layers of sand mixed with clay and of slabs of gneiss sloping steeply to the S; these slabs obviously covered an artificial mound (Fig. 40). Extension of the test to the N showed that the top of the mound had been removed before the construction of the passage. A small test into the mound showed sloping layers of artificial material; a small fragment of the skeleton of a child indicates that it is a tumulus. Though further work is necessary it already seems clear that both the wall and the mound belong to the very early phase, the FIG. 41 settlement area of which is known not far to the N. In the centre of the square the intention was to dig the Late Imperial levels on the E side of the rectangular building. The successive levels identified ran from the fill of the robber trench of the rectangular building, through two Imperial levels (the earlier 3rd/4th Ct AD), what is presumably the C level relating to the round well and finally in a limited area the A ground level similar to that in adjacent tests. On the N by the ECh House two tests were made in the chief room ABEM at the corers, EB and AB, once again with the aim of clarifying the stratigraphy. The slabs of the floor (removed at various times since the 6th Ct AD) rested on a layer of pink mortar over a level of stones, among which was a statuette. The foundations of all three walls were carefully investigated; A and B do not bond though they are obviously contemporary; A is 1.75m deep and B 2.5m. In the narrow foundation trench was a coin (posthumous issue of Constantine in a quadriga, of 337-341) which allows the construction to be dated to the middle of the 4th Ct AD. It can be noted that the E wall along the Rue du Theatre did not have a deep foundation (1.10m) and was not founded on any other wall, while the other side was lined by wall T, of various styles of construction (includ- ing one polygonal). Thus it would seem that the Rue du Theatre was restricted on the W but the building of private houses. The other test (Fig. 41) brought to light the foundations of walls K (E-W) and L (at right angles) without any indication of their date. At a lower level wall M running N-S preserved to only one course of marble squares resting on plaques of gneiss and belonging to the A period; this was accompanied by a typical layer of burning. Skala Soteros. Rescue work was carried out in 1986 at this largely EBA site (AR 1991-92, 53) after damage from road building. A robbed stone built grave of LR/ECh was found with tile floor but no finds or roof, and another burial, con- sidered ECh from lack of finds. From the LA period there was a pottery layer of the late 6th/early 5th Ct BC, but no struc- tures. The EBA levels lie immediately below the LA and consisted of buildings and part of the surround wall. A semicircular structure contained storage vessels with grain (burnt); water sieving produced evidence of the grape. Two anthropomorphic stelai were found. An earlier level was identified but there is apparently no N occupation. (ADelt 41 Chr, 173-5) Ch. Koukoule-Chrysanthake reports on her work in 1990 in AEMTH 4 (1990) 531-545. Triada.

The 1984 season at the important Byz church of Polystylon (AR 1991-92, 53) is commented on by Ch. Bakirtzes and'N. Zekos. The crude walling off of the narthex area is dated by pottery to the Palaeologan period. Two floor phases were found in the nave, three in the sanctuary. Between floors a and b in the nave was a coin of Romanos I (920-44) and an 11th Ct anonymous follis. Evidence shows this church to have been a MByz three-aisled basilica of the Protatos B type. Burials were found in the N aisle and included a reused</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 63 inscribed R burial plaque. Two important burials were found outside the N wall, one in a reused sarcophagus with a conch which was apparently intended for a devotional icon. A finely- painted flaring cross within a medallion painted in red, pink and white on the other was removed and placed on canvas. The discovery of ancillary structures to the N, as well as the age, architectural type and devotional structures within the monu- ment indicate that this was probably the episcopal church of Polystylon in the MByz period, and that the associated buildings represent the bishop's palace.

She continued her work in 1992 (Ergon, 69-72) on the A wall of the N peribolos and completed the excavation of the buildings associated with it. These are dated to the end of the 7th/beginning of the 6th Ct by the quantity of pottery, and thus the wall which antedates them can be assigned to the 7th Ct, belonging to the first Clazomenian colony. Work on the internal N colonnade of the ship shed was also completed, but the structure is very badly destroyed. By its E edge was a furnace for metal, not yet excavated as it is overlaid by a LHL wall probably connected with the cemetery. Of this eight more HL tombs of the 2nd Ct were dug (1 cremation, 7 burials). As well as a handsome pair of gold earrings and other jewellery, the notable finds were a series of figurines of children. Work on the inside of the N enclosure gave a stratigraphic sequence from the end of the 7th/beginning of the 6th Ct to the end of the 4th/beginning of the 3rd Ct. Didymoteichon. Ch.

(ADelt 41 Chr, 192-5) In addition investigations continued in 1986 on the first ECh structure (6th Ct) to be found in the city on Katsantone and Kanatakouzinou, outside the original Byz walled town. (ADelt 41 Chr, 190-1) A rich pottery deposit dated by coins of Michael VIII (1261-82) was found at a depth of only 60cm, in a pit dug into yellowish-green clay-like earth. This earth included a deposit of unglazed pottery reminiscent of ECh examples. A sherd with thickly applied brown slip was found here, which together with the fact that the deposit lay on top of the ECh wall may indicate that this is 7th-8th Ct ware, notoriously difficult to date. The masonry of the foundations and lower courses of the ECh basilica in trench B, where no use of spolia was encountered (Fig. 42), is compared to that of St. Polyeuk- tos in Constantinople (524-7).

The refectory was uncovered (13.90 x 4.80m, chord of the apse 3.50m, walls at some points as high as 1.80m). A total of three rooms and a 'stoa' between the katholikon and the refectory were found. Finds include table implements and glassware fragments from a variety of shapes, including so-called 'prunted beakers'. These are not known elsewhere in Greece apart from Corinth, where they originated, but are found in the Balkans, Russia and even Egypt. Also found were intact glazed vessels (?canata), glazed 12th Ct sherds, Zeuxippus ware, etc. A first destruction date in the late 12th/early 13th Ct was supported by the finding of imitations of Latin coins of the period. The second building phase is accompanied by coins of Michael VIII (1261-1282) and habitation seems to have continued to the 14th Ct. The find of a fine but fragmentary steatite plaque depicting St. Theodore Stratelates in relief (12th Ct, Constantinople?), along with the high quality table ware (including luxury Islamic imports), indicates that the monastery had contacts with the capital and other urban centres. A lead seal of Konstantinos Gavras points to a link with this famous family. (ADelt 40 Chr, 282-7) Nestos valley. In AEMTH 4 (1990) 627-37 D. Triantafyllos reports on survey in 1990 and its results.

Anna Kapela area work started in 1984 was continued and completed (Chiaka Chronika 1984-5, 12ff). The site lies on a slope which gave a considerable depth of deposit; the main architectural discovery was a well-built HL structure but R remains also occur. Finds include fresco with natural and geometric motifs, bf and rf pottery, coins of Chios, bg pottery, Megarian bowls, figurines, bone pins and loomweights. On Ag. Apostolon the walls of a monumental structure came to light, built in the pseudoisodomic style with tile fragments and small stones in the interstices. On Ag.

A stone cist grave with gabled lid containing two burials accompanied by four tearbottles et al., of the 2nd Ct BC, came to light at Gymnasiarchou Madia and Rizariou; a disturbed tomb with bones only, and possibly associated with a small group of lamps, was found nearby. On Skanabe and Aplotarias a test excavation by the Byz Ephorate followed by the PR and C Ephorate found a wall and bg sherds below but could not be completed because of danger from the adjacent buildings. Foundations for an extension to the Church of the Panagia Letsaina disclosed a deposit of A pottery with kylikes and bowls; bad weather impeded further systematic ex- ploration but excavation is to continue.

At 'Recha nera' an EBA building complex came to light of three building phases, with considerable quantities of pottery, stone and bone implements. (ADelt 41 Chr, 198) Poliochni (AR 1991-92, 54). In 1992 excavation by the Italian School took place in three different areas. Section A had been opened up in 1988, S of the gate. After cutting through layers and structures of the green, red and yellow periods, work was stopped because of a pile of clay and stones for which it was not then possible to find a reasonable explanation. With the deepening and enlargement of the section in 1992 it was possible to prove that the pile was the result of the collapse of a wall made of fairly regular stones. The layer of rubble, which is possibly the result of the shock waves of an earthquake, shows a consistent list of 30° to the S. There also came to light the foundation, as well as the foundation trench, of this wall which now can be seen as the earliest wall on this side of the town. Section M was opened in an area of the site that had not been investigated before and which lies E of road 105 and ends at the top of the hill. In the 1.5m wide trench remains of N-S walls were discovered resting on a thicker wall (ca .70m) with the same N-S orientation, which seems to be the limit of the settlement on this side of the town. The pottery material, which belongs to the E red period but possibly also to the ?black, allows the hypothesis that the town started at least from the E red period, and occupied an area that did not exceed the limit of the hill today. Section N: the study of the area surrounding the archae- ological site continued so as to check the more obvious anomalies that came to light in 1991 during the resistivity and geomagnetic surveys and the coring. The section was opened at the positions of cores 25 and 26 near the guard house, in an area designated for a car park, and produced layers which give evidence of human activity during the whole PR period; pottery was found which covers the entire period from the red phase to the yellow. There was no evidence of buildings. Work also continued with the conservation of the fortifications, so far on walls 35/36 N of the gate and wall 10/1 la-b S of the gate. Lesbos.

A part of the city wall also came to light. (ADelt 41 Chr, 202-3) Moria Quarry. In the summer of 1992 the University of British Columbia and the 10th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities carried out a survey of the large Roman marble quarry near the village of Moria some 4km N of Mytilene. Professor Hector Williams reports: "This marks the first systematic study of one of the many quarries of anc. Lesbos. The site lies under lkm from the sea at the edge of an escarpment that rises to about 100m above sea level; its various pits extend for about .5km with intensive work at its E side. It appears to have been exploited particu- larly in R times until at least the 4th Ct AD as Moria marble is mentioned in the Diocletianic price edict. There are traces of sparse and modest anc. foundations in the area and in the late 1950s the former Ephor S. Charitonides discovered a number of quarrymen's tools, including picks and wedges, in a salvage excavation. The quarry has been much altered in the last several decades by stone extraction for building purposes and by its use as a garbage dump. Recently designated as a protected archaeological site, it still preserves many worked faces, as well as hundreds of complete or fragmentary blocks, columns, basins, altars, etc. in various stages of completion and it was possible to determine a complete sequence of extraction of, for example, stone columns of varying diametres from ca. 30cm to nearly im. Complete plans and sections of the quarry were prepared, as well as detailed drawings of individual blocks and columns. A section of well-preserved aqueduct, perhaps built to service the needs of the quarry workers, was traced through the area; it may be a branch of the well known aqueduct whose magnificent long arched bridge, 20m high, still crosses a valley several kilometers to the W." Mytilene. Parts of the city wall were investigated in four areas in 1986 and a plan is given of the section found in co- operation with the Canadian school (AR 1986-87, 52). The wall dates from the 3rd quarter of the 5th Ct and in places rests on natural rock, elsewhere it overlies A tombs. Much constructional detail is reported. At Longou 13 a monumental structure came to light, and N of this the deposit from a shrine with bones, shells, figurines and pottery of A, C, HL and R. On Theolytou excavation prior to sewage work brought to light a R public building with two mosaic floors. On Kioutacheias the lifting of the ECh mosaic allowed excavation beneath, which revealed an underground stoa; it is said locally that a passage existed here leading to the castle. The structure should be dated to R times as it has a terminus ante quem from the mosaic. On Kampa two cist graves of the end of the 2nd Ct were found. (ADelt 41 Chr, 198-200) Work by the Canadians in 1992 concentrated on preparing the publication of the excavations in the Demeter sanctuary on the acropolis (AR 1991-92, 54) and the site near the N Harbour that have been excavated since 1984. Particularly important was the completion of the study of the faunal material, especially from the sanctuary; the large quantity of material-over 60,000 bones-and its range of dates, from the late 7th Ct BC to the early 19th Ct AD, provided an opportun- ity for diachronic studies of Mytilene fauna on a scale rarely as yet approached at a site in Greece. Of particular interest from the Demeter sanctuary, in addition to the expected bones of pigs and very young piglets, were bones of dogs with butcher marks. Work also continued on the pottery, lamps and small finds. The saving of the Geni Tzami is noted in Eleutherotypia 25.2.93 while the Sunday supplement of Kathemerine 23.5.93 publishes an account of the Kastro. Sarakrinas. M.

In 1986 two plots were excavated in the area of the G cemetery, with LHL buildings in isodomic masonry and with a well. These went out of use in ER times, when the area was used as a cemetery (five cists with several burials each containing glass vessels, bone objects et al.). From the level of the G cemetery below the floors of the HL house came a relief burial pithos, a G funerary amphora surrounded with a layer of burnt iron and a simple child's grave. Work started on an adjacent plot but stopped for lack of funds. (ADelt 41 Chr, 214) Yria: Sanctuary of ?Dionysus. In 1992 the Archaeological Society took over the support of the work of B. Lambrinoud- akis (previously a University of Athens excavation) which this year was confined to the final stages of tidying the site. It had been decided that of the four EA temples (starting with one of the 8th Ct), only the last (that of the 2nd half of the 6th Ct) should remain visible; some reconstruction was therefore necessary in order that all the marble fragments found could be placed in situ.

Paroikia. In 1985 a third season of work was carried out on the cemetery, on the W and S sides of the area. Marble vessels, some inscribed, were found below sea level and also stelai, notable among which are one with the name MHKINE, known on Paros, and another of the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC with the head of a girl. There were also later tile graves. The cemetery seems to have been carefully laid out in compart- ments belonging to families or kin groups in the 7th/6th Cts BC but in the 5th Ct it was extended S and W, apparently without such arrangement, though it is possible that the inaccessible areas to the N and E below the mod. roads might contradict this assumption. Sarcophagi have been found previously in the area toward the sea. (ADelt 40 Chr, 289) No excavation, only cleaning, was carried out in 1986 but among finds was another ur, inscribed APXIKAEOYY.

Paroikia, 500m S of Katapoliane, excavation in 1986 revealed a group of LHL pottery kilns, one making use of a section of an A pithos. A group of rooms to the N and E are probably linked functionally to the kilns; one had a floor of opus tesselatum. At Phloga, 200m to the NE, a HL building complex was uncovered just 160-180m W of the city wall in which a LHL sculpture workshop was found, identified by the marble waste and number of small pieces of sculpture. An adjacent area known from 1968 and excavated in 1974, with a LHL house with three entrances and a stair, was cleaned in 1986.

In room 5 the fallen floor was removed, disclosing the corridor beneath. An unusual find here was a large block of andesite. In Xeste 3 excavation was carried out outside the SW corer and com- puter recording was successfully tried. Three tiny ECyc figurines were found, one cut from a broken marble bowl (see also Eleutherotypia 7.7.92). In 1985 ECyc material had been found by column 17, and work here was continued, revealing slabs like an ECyc tomb from beneath which came a group of heavily encrusted figurines of various types. It is suggested that the stone pile may have been some kind of cenotaph or memorial. Kamari. In 1986 work was carried out on the G and A cemetery but no detailed report is given.

On the acropolis an outwork was identified at the SE end of the G wall as well as three more towers on the NW. Small finds in this area dated from all periods from EBA to 3rd Ct AD. In the lower town measures to prevent erosion by the gymnasium brought to light a stratified sequence with accompanying small finds; notable were a bronze ring with a glass bezel showing a female head, and part of another large relief pithos. A number of LA blocks, a column and a stone with scratched inscription (illustrated, no text) came to light in a stone pile.

On the site of the planned primary school a R tomb complex came to light in 1985, consisting of two enclosures, a monumental structure and three roofed tombs; all contained multiple burials with evidence of cult and a range of finds. On coin evidence they can be dated to the 3rd Ct AD. At Psares Phoradas, a rescue excavation was carried out in an LM IIIA cave tomb which, though robbed, produced pot- tery and a bronze dagger. It also contained a pithos burial with 15 pots below it; 19 further pots were made up from sherds; there was evidence of at least three pithoi. The find is import- ant for the combination of excellent Knossian pottery with burials of a type not normally found. (ADelt 40 Chr, 293-5) Chersonesos (AR 1991-92 59). Three sections of the R town were investigated in 1986. An area of storage and workshop use was identified, together with a road; finds included pithoi, loomweights and moulds for plastic vessels depicting a ship, a chariot and an animal with a mane. Some bg pottery was also found. In another plot a well-built LR complex (much spolia) with a good water system came to light; a terminus ante quem is given by grave pottery of the E 7th Ct AD. Of interest is the fact that this proves the abandonment by this stage of this section of the town. No destruction is attested either on this site or on others in the town. Adjacent was another strongly built building with paved court; finds included a R inscription (text not given), a panther or griffin head in marble, a column et al. The third plot produced only a deep deposit of LR pottery but no structures; a similar deposit had come to light near the theatre. A well and some ER small sculpture were also found. (ADelt 41 Chr, 222) Galatas. G. Rethymniotakis, at the Swiss seminar on BA frescoes, mentioned some details of his important new site, which has clear relations to palatial Knossos. A fresco frag- ment has been found in the lowest level (with an MMIIIA grooved cup), possibly depicting a shrine with plants on either side. Press reports of the excavation appeared in Nike 11.8.92 et al. Gortyn (AR 1991-92, 59). The objectives of the 1992 excava- tions by the Italian School were as follows: in the lower town, at the Praetorium, the granite columns of the Troas were completely cleared; these formed the impressive facade of the stoa in front of the temple of the Augustan Gods. Trench 1 (room 47) was extended, bringing to light a lavatory which connects with the first installation of the baths which suc- ceeded the Praetorium. Four columns of the later of the lavatories which connected with those baths were restored. At the foot of the hill of Profitis Elias, an area 10 x 10m was excavated which contained a pile of terracottas and small vases, mainly 2nd-lst Ct BC. These belonged to a nearby temple of Demeter which had already been located by Karo at the beginning of the century. The material, great in quantity but mostly fragmentary, consisted mainly of representations of votaries with piglets. The discovery is important due to its location outside the town and near a spring of the Demetreion of Gortyn. Immediately E of the present Gymnasion a few HL tombs came to light with poor offerings. The discovery of an ostrich egg in a R tomb is reported by Apogeumatine 14.7.92.</page><page sequence="66">68 E.B. FRENCH Herakleion. N.

(Ergon 1992, 93- 99 with up-to-date coloured plan) In the NE sector, where there is evidence of use over a very long period, the Neopalatial (2nd phase) entrance was found only 6m away from the spring. A deposit of clay ritual vessels and stone utensils came to light, including 14 ophite offering tables; this deposit is probably the source of a Linear A inscription which came to light in a 6th Ct AD level. The problem of the temple of the R period was solved; buildings C- D are a single unit; the two-roomed D was destroyed twice and after the second time one room was repaired and encompassed in a strong peribolos with entrance from the S. This, like the temple of Hermes Kedrites was probably paid for by Nikano- ras. From the area N of C-D, structures came to light which are given a terminus post quem by small finds from the level beneath, which included a LG bronze horse from a pair. In the central sector two more rooms of building U were found, dating from the 1st phase of Neopalatial; room 17 was used for storage and 18 for the preparation of food. A 4th Neopalatial phase has been identified in excavation under Q, and is at present called Ub; it consists of three walls of a large room later than U but earlier than the crepidoma of the sanctuary peribolos. A deposit under Q with many pots and 13 offering tables of ophite may belong to the period of open air worship or to the earlier building. A stray find from this sector is a broken tablet of the Protopalatial, with signs in a very early version of Linear A. In the NW sector a paved way sloping N-S with a drain beside it links to the ceremonial way used in the open-air worship of the 2nd Neopalatial period. It is now clear that room W is earlier than the sanctuary peribolos and a contem- porary room must be sought on the NW edge of the site. In the SW sector along the N of the three terraces for open air worship in the 2nd and 3rd Neopalatial, phases previously thought to link to U are now linked to Ub and to W. On terrace al, two rooms of the Protopalatial were identified but it is not clear whether they link to V or are part of a separate structure. S of al MM II pottery was found in a stone spread; nearby an earth spread with fragments of mud-brick, plaster and wood, but no stone, shows that fill was imported to form the plateia. Knossos (AR 1991-92 59-60). A season of testing and excava- tion to clarify the chronology and architectural history of the SW house (S V), the house NW of the S house (S VI) and the house W of the SW house (S VII) was undertaken by Dr C.F. Macdonald, BSA Knossos Curator. S V and S VI. Convincing evidence was found to indicate that the two houses in S V and S VI were, in fact, a single architectural unit in the Neopalatial period. However, no major deposits of this period were discovered, due to previous excavation by Hogarth and Evans/Mackenzie. Beneath the W half of S V, a MM IIA rectangular building was discovered, constructed on terraced N levels. It was built of medium-sized uncut stones with white plaster floors. A destruction with burning was followed by construction in MM IIB of a more monumental building with larger cut blocks-one with a mason's mark-using the MM IIA destruction material as fill. The largest MM IIA fill deposit included many bovid and ovicaprid horcores cut from the skulls, as well as two sealings and a fragment of a Linear A tablet, the earliest yet found at Knossos. The MM IIB building was also destroyed by fire at the end of the Old Palace period. Both structures were architecturally independent of the palace, contrary to the assertion of Evans and Mackenzie that the whole area of the later SW house was part of the Old Palace. S VII. An important discovery was the NE corer of a G house uncovered in S VII 2, with a pithos the only object on a barely discernible floor level. The level at which this was found was the same as the M levels some metres to the E, indicating that S VII 2 is down the anc. slope and that M levels lie beneath. Heavy cleaning N of S VII 2 produced the top of a massive M wall with a mason's mark, the start of a MM IIIB/LM IA deposit and fragments of M fresco with human figures. Behind the E facade of S VII in areas 1, 3 and 4, there was much post-M disturbance, including excavation apparently by Hogarth in 1900. Beneath the backfill in S VII 1 and 3, fragments of LM II-IIIA1 floors were found, on the same level as a probable G roadway and two walls. In addition, a SM pit had dug even deeper; its contents included many fragments of a Palace Style jar which would once have belonged to a floor deposit. In S VII 1 and 4, good evidence was found for the architectural sequence. In S VII 4, the earliest Neopalatial facade (MM III/LM I) was 2m W of the already exposed ashlar facade which is probably as late as LM II, as Mackenzie suggested. After a destruction accompanied by burning at the beginning of LM IIIA1, the E door of the building was blocked and the facade thickened. No floors remained. At some later date (?post-M), a rough, oblique wall was built on top of the facade. A second season of geophysical testing on the R town was carried out by C. Shell (BSA) in close collaboration with Dr S. Papamarinopoulos of Patras University. The work extended S the investigation of the previous year and confirmed the wide extent of the remains. In addition to the major building reported last year, rectilinear features at the S of the gradio- meter survey area were confirmed by resistivity to represent large rooms in a complex that apparently extends for 100m along the central section of the W boundary of the field. A 20 x 14m feature N of the Tavera, with aligned buildings immediately SE of it, may be a temple base. Four areas, each 40m square, were examined by impulse radar in order to investigate features revealed by other methods and a possible central open space in the town plan. The outline of the Knossos 2000 project is presented in the press in Rizospastes 2.5.93. The decision to procede with the plan for the repair and conservation of the site is reported in depth by Ethnos 24.7.92; Ethnos 26.2.93 highlights the danger from earthquake that this work is intended to prevent.</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 69 FIG. 43 Kommos. Professor J.W. Shaw (ASCS) reports on the 1992 season: "Work in the S area (Fig. 43) concentrated on uncovering more of the plans of house X and of the two great civic buildings, T of LM I and P of LM III. The broad MM/LM I road (17), which probably connected Kommos with Phaistos (see Hesperia 55 (1986) 219-269 for the latest full preliminary report) also served as the dividing line between the town spreading to its N and civic centre at Kommos. House X, of which the life-span covers the LM IA-LM IIIA2 periods, rose immediately N of the ashlar buildings and of the E-W road-a prime location. In 1992 we exposed its N, S, and W limits. A number of rooms (X8-X9, X14) some partially excavated in the past, were cleared, as was a two- flight staircase located at the SE comer of the house. A deep sounding in room X2 produced an LM IA deposit (Fig. 44) thus supplementing a valuable stratigraphic series that con- tinued through the LM III period. In this room were found a few steatite seals (one a lentoid disk, the other 'pillow' shaped) incised with abstract patterns. Various fresco fragments from room X1 and space X8 were cleaned and copied in watercolour at our base in Pitsidia. The composition from XI depicted white lilies against an ochre background in a rocky setting. Fresco fragments from other rooms speak of the high status of the house during its prime in LM I. The dimensions of LM III building P, as exposed so far, are 38.51m E-W and 39.60m N-S. The largest LM III building FIG. 44</page><page sequence="68">70 E.B. FRENCH FIG. 45 known, it consisted of at least six broad. roofed galleries opening onto a court on the W. While open and doorless on that side, they were completely closed at the back on the E by a massive monumental facade. Most interestingly, the building incorporated in its lower part the handsome orthostat facade of the LM I building T (Fig. 45), which we thus learned set the limit on this side for the LM III building. Otherwise, the later building caused the destruction of the underlying building because of the low setting of the floors and the levelling of the pre-existing architecture. Gaps noted at intervals in the upper courses of the E wall of P may have been windows, but the evidence is not certain. During 1992 one of the major aims of the fieldwork was to clear one of P's galleries in its entirety down to its floor. gallery 3 was chosen since galleries 1 and 2 were built over part by Archaic building Q. The project was carried out in seven large, contiguous trenches. In places, gallery 3 was found filled with masses of collapsed masonry, which helps establish a ceiling height of about 4m. Part of the W end of gallery 3 was reused as a MG building by adding a rear, or E wall. Clearing gallery 3 has revealed no cross-walls, thus lending support to the argument, made in detail elsewhere, that the galleries probably sheltered ships during non-sailing months, mostly in the winter. We also learned that there were no doorways leading S and N: this gallery at least could be entered only from the W. Below the collapsed rubble of the walls the upper surfaces of galleries 1-3 were scorched, especially toward their E ends, suggesting that the building was destroyed by fire. The final use of the galleries during the BA was in LM IIIB. Cups and amphoras were found in fragments, the latter with traces of red matter, which also partially filled a bowl. Part of the last use of gallery 3 is also represented by two ovens, lined in clay and set within the floor, and by a hearth built in the SE corer. Building T is known partially for reasons mentioned above. Parts of its N and E wings had been traced in the past border- ing a court paved with pebbles. In the N wing facing the court was a portico. At the NW were large rooms, largely destroyed by the sea, opening on to the stoa and court. This season, by clearing away accumulations first of sand and then of alluvial clay, we discovered the LM I pebble court extending S and up to a thick ashlar wall built in LM IA (Fig. 46). This clearly belongs to building T and has an entrance leading into the SE corer of the central court. The area S of this wall needs further exploration to see if it defines the S facade of T or constitutes the N border of a more extensive S wing. Presently, we have exposed a series of floors and pavements to its S, including a slab-pavement, which may possibly be an E-W road. Traces of another possible pavement (MM?) were found at a lower level further S. The general outlines of T have thus been revealed. With its exterior facades constructed of massive ashlars, with wings on the N, E, and W facing onto a central court, the building is obviously Palatial in style-if not an actual palace. The court is 28.7m wide and 44.30m long. The</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 71 entire building was perhaps 86m (min. 66.60m) E-W and 52.40m N-S, some 4,500m2, thus somewhat larger than the Palace of Kato Zakros (ca. 4,000m2), but smaller than Phaistos (ca. 8,8(0m2). T contrasts with the other Palatial buildings by being more regular in its outline (the N and E sides appear to have been almost straight) and by once being more closed to the exterior. Security seems to have been a major consider- ation. It is to be regretted that more of the interior rooms are not better preserved, especially on the W, where a pier-and door partition, a slab-paved room entered from the E-W road, and evidence for a second floor suggest functions other than storage. Another dimension of the Kommos site being explored, and hitherto unexpected, is the existence of significant MM architectural remains of one or more large buildings below at least the E wing of building T. One N-S wall (AA). 2.30m thick, may be the E wall of a large Protopalatial structure. During 1992 we explored some of the overlying Gr levels E and S of the Gr sanctuary (Fig. 47). In particular, work on building F of the 5th Ct BC, still partly covered by our E scarp, was competed. In gallery 3 we exposed the remains of Z, a MG building contemporary with temple B, containing FIG. 47 substantial floor deposits including a number of iron javelin tips (Fig. 48) and much pottery.

Two excavations were carried out in 1985 prior to building; on the site of a prospective hotel complex eight tests were dug revealing parts of seven buildings of two phases. Four dated from the 3rd/4th Ct AD and were well built private houses, a central one larger than the rest; all functional items had been removed. The later phase of three buildings, again private houses with a larger central focus, were less well built and can be dated to the 5th-7th Ct AD. These contained much domestic pottery. In another plot a large building with E-W axis of 13 rooms on two levels appears also to have been a private house of the 2nd Ct AD. Notable were domestic features such as cupboards and the stands for wooden fixtures. Three built tombs had been cut into the remains. (ADelt 40 Chr, 295-6) Mt Ida.

Coulson (ASCS) took place in 1992 at this site where ruins of an extensive settlement have survived from the end of the BA/EIA. Dr Coulson reports: "In total six trenches of 4 x 4m were excavated. Two were located at the W side of the hill: parts of two rooms of a house were discovered, of which the northernmost has two phases (probably LH IIIC and PG). The walls were built from irregular, medium sized stones and at some points survive up to m. In this area, as well as sherds and parts of vessels, a clay bull figurine and a copper ring were discovered. The other four trenches were excavated at the E of the level ground. In section B 1 parts of three rooms of a building were discovered, of which one was excavated to the level of a slab floor where seven quers, three grinders, parts of pithoi and shells were discovered. In section B2 the situation was almost the same. The one very well preserved room which was also excavated to the level of the slab floor brought to light hearths and parts of pithoi, an almost complete skyphos, a potter's wheel and a collection of shells (penna). In trenches B3 and B4 at least three rooms were excavated to floor level and had two phases. The finds included many stone tools, grinders and quers, as well as six clay bobbin-shaped weights. Remains of burned wood on the floor were also apparent, as well as large burned pieces of mud-brick. The pottery of these trenches included two pithoi and two skyphoi." Dories Mirabellou. In 1985 tombs came to light in water works near the cemetery but they proved not to be anc.; subsequent testing in the area, however, revealed MM sherds and walling which will be excavated.

During the summer of 1992, work by the ASCS took place at the lower settlement on Vronda and at the upper settlement at the Kastro. Dr W.D.E. Coulson, and Professors G.C. Gesell and L.P. Day report: "Vronda: Cleaning concentrated in four areas, with the following goals: building B: to establish the N and S bound- aries and to explore traces of earlier remains of the MM period to the N. Building CID: to recover the walls and corers of rooms still in balks. Building J: to trace the walls on the W side of the building where they disappeared into balks. Building I-O-N: to determine the early history of building I with soundings, to clean the floors of building 0, and to clear the remainder of the W rooms of building N to establish its history and W boundary. Much of the activity in 1992 concentrated on building I-O- N. In building I, soundings were made beneath the floors of rooms 3 and 4 to find earlier floors and to date the construction of the building. A kylix with bulbous stem from beneath the floor of room 4 provides a firm LM IIIC date for the construc- tion. A few stone tools were picked up on the floor of the building, and the oven in room 3 was also cleaned. Two soundings in the courtyard to the N of building I helped to determine the boundaries of LG Grave 35 and provided additional pottery and animal bones for a study of the differ- ences between courtyard deposits and those from within the building. There was considerable activity in building O. The bench in the NE corer of room 1 was partially dismantled to reveal an oven or hearth beneath it; although this burned installation had a surface like an oven, it did not have the stone structures found in other ovens at Vronda and is more likely a hearth. In room 2 the floor was cleaned in several areas, including through the doorway and into room 3. In room 3 the oven in the NE corner, left untouched by the disturbance of grave 28, was cleaned out. Finally, cleaning in the W wall of room 3 revealed a blocked doorway leading down into room 1 of building N. In building N, the doorways between rooms 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 were found to have been blocked in the last phase of the building's use. In room 3, when the doorway was blocked, the bench along the E wall was extended to the N wall. Room 4 was further explored; although much disturbed by an olive tree in the centre of the room, some of the floor and a hearth in the middle of the room were still preserved. Exploration beneath our dump to the W of room 4 revealed further structures, at first thought to be a tholos tomb, but after clearing seen to be the corner of yet another room to the W; no doubt this building complex continued to the SW. Finally, the remainder of room 5 was cleared, at least as far as the erosion line on the W. Beneath stone tumble and a layer of roofing clay, the floor of earth and bedrock appeared, with a stone platform in the NE corner and a hearth/oven in the middle of the floor. The hearth/oven was a burned patch on the floor, but with a stone lining and a stone and pise oven built on top of it. Analysis of the different types of ovens in the building has suggested that the mud-bricks found around the oven in room 1, which were used to suggest that there was a burned destruction in this room, were actually part of the structure of a hearth/oven like that in room 5. On the basis of the 1992 cleaning of I-O-N, we now have a clearer idea of the date of the original building (LM IIIC), its history (buildings O and N were originally one), the function of the rooms, and the different types of hearths and ovens in use. We also now know that the complex extended even farther to the SW. The Kastro: Work on the Kastro consisted of testing beneath the floors of various buildings; this was designed to supplement the stratigraphy of the site which had been worked out preliminarily during the 1991 study season and to provide a check on the ceramic sequences. Testing occurred in the three main areas of the site: E and N slopes, W slope, and the NW building complex. On the E and N slopes, floors were scraped down to their original surfaces in rooms 7, 9, 12 and 13. A test beneath the floor in room 1 revealed an earlier pithos in the NW comer of the room. Inside the pithos was found a small jug of LG date; the presence of this jug within the pithos suggests that the earlier floor, consisting of bedrock, on which the pithos rested, was also LG in date. There appear to be, therefore, two LG phases on the E slope and nothing earlier. This is in marked contrast with the stratigraphic phasing on the W slope, where the sequence runs from LM IIIC through O. During the 1991 season, nine stratigraphic phases had been distinguished during the study of deposits in rooms 22-24. Tests in 1992 beneath the LG floors of rooms 31-33 revealed surfaces and associated ceramic deposits belonging to both the IIIC and PG periods. The presence of such deposits thereby not only confirms the stratigraphic sequences worked out earlier for rooms 31-33 but also underscores the fact that the earliest phases of habitation on the Kastro were concentrated on the W slope. A similar test was made beneath the floor of room 4 of the NW building complex, where both IIIC and PG surfaces were revealed. In fact, the stratigraphic sequences in room 4 were found to be exactly similar to those in room 3, thus confirming the interpretation of the sequences (IIIC-LG) in the N part of the building complex."

Pelon of the French School reports on work in 1992: Thanks to the assistance of C. Vittorakis, conservator at the Heraklion Museum, who supervised the lifting and replacing of the slabs in corridor C, it was possible to continue the research of 1990 which had centred on the'pillared room IX,2 (AR 1990-91, 73). The 1992 tests extended to the N part of room IX,1 and of corridor C. The Prepalatial fill which exists in the S part of IX,2 is interrupted, at the level of the N line of pillars of the hypostyle hall, by a wall forming the facade of an MM II building with an E-W orientation, matching the already existing orientation of the Palace. This facade is the S limit of several small rooms where typical Prepalatial pottery was found, notably a small rough jar like others from quartier 1.</page><page sequence="72">74 E.B. FRENCH The continuation of this building was not found N of IX,2, presumably because of alterations made here during the building of the Palace, but the levels crammed with EM II pottery continued beneath the paving of corridor C, confirming the conclusions made in 1990 on the evidence further S. It is thus now certain that there was a important Prepalatial building (Fig. 49) N of the central court, which already used the orientation of the later structure. This was followed on the same spot by the two phases of Proto- and Neopalatial already discussed in BCH 1992, I. Palace, NE edge. C. Baurain and P. Darcque (French School) report on their work this area, which has been in abeyance since 1985: The considerable amount of study which has taken place in the interval since the last excavation has given a good basis of evidence. This year the aim was to complete the architectural and stratigraphic investigation in the main excavation area, i.e. the zone extending E of sectors XXV-XXVII of the Palace (Fig. 50). The floor of the trapezoidal storeroom 1,3, which had contained some 20 storage vessels, was lifted after cleaning in order to investigate the levels prior to the destruc- tion at the end of MM II which is widespread in this area (e.g. ks^ MA I FIG. 49 FIG. 50</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 75 FIG. 51 FIG. 53 the MM IIA fill, at least 2.25m deep, which was excavated beneath room 3,3, destroyed in MM II). The walls of room 1,3 are built of four to five courses of ashlar masonry. The floor of the storeroom itself rests on a deep fill of pebbles and sherds datable to MM II and including (in the N sector) a deposit of fragmentary vases (Fig. 51). In the N sector, running under the walls, is a fill dating to EM IIA while in the S an occupation level of MM also extends beneath the walls of the storeroom. However, the primary new evidence of the 1992 season concerned the means of access to the Palace on the NE. Relatively early in the Neopalatial period (to judge by the pottery evidence) a porch with three columns (61-3) was built in front of the NE entrance. On the E this porch opens onto an unroofed area of which the rough surface lies ca. im lower than the threshold of the Palace (12,74-12,87/13,93). This unroofed area is edged on the S by a walkway of stones (now completely cleared) which at one point abuts the wall of cut blocks (54) and completely surrounds the little rectangular FIG. 52 structure 10 (Fig. 52). On the E it would seem that earlier structures (e.g. wall 76 and its S extension) were reused. Perhaps they were covered by a form of stone glacis after the first phase of this unit. At the N the early arrangement is obscured by the various rebuildings which it underwent throughout the Neopalatial period. The excavation did however reveal that the N base of the porch (63) is related in the same way as the S one to an area partly cobbled, partly floored with slabs (Fig. 53). The edge of this area has not yet been found clearly as it lies under a mass of huge blocks extending to the facade of the Palace. At an earlier stage the surface 64 ran under wall 65 and must have been related to the walkway 69 which edges the white-painted floor 72 for its full length. Earlier this whole area was associated with the construction of the first phase of building 12, the traces of which can be seen in the lower courses of walls 65 and 66. To a later stage of building 12 we should probably assign the large cobbled court which extends along the whole N facade of the Palace, as well as walls 52 and 53 which edge a cobbled passage (73) and a relaid floor just that the base of the NE corer of the Palace. All these alterations are dated to the Neopalatial period. Quartier Nu. J. Driessen and A. Famoux report on their work for the French School: There were two objectives for the 1992 season: to define the E and S limits of the quarter and to establish the chrono- logical status of the construction and of previous building. Thus 14 new squares were opened in the SE area (Fig. 54) and some of the balks left since 1989 were cleared. In addition seven test trenches were cut in rooms of the E and W buildings and in the court which separates them. At the E it has been confirmed that the E wall of room X,11 is an outside wall; it continues S and thus forms a clear boundary to the occupation area. The area to the E is one of open air, street or square. Room X,22-23 which was cleaned this year contains a hearth between two column bases; it was originally a large room but was divided in two during a second phase. In it several vases were found, including a 'box' in terracotta divided into</page><page sequence="74">76 E.B. FRENCH _~~~~~~~~~~FIG. 54 ~FIG. 56 FIG. 54 FIG. 55 compartments. Room X,6 immediately to the W contained a column base. E of X,11 a small rectangular construction was found; it was of small size (4.5 x 3.5m) and contained a small oven made of dressed slabs. In the destruction debris was found a skeleton, probably male (Fig. 55) as well as some whole pots (a krater, a cooking pot, a shallow bowl and a stirrup jar). The thickness of the walls and the different levels at which objects were found leads to the conclusion that this building had a second floor. It is nevertheless possible that in the final period of occupation in the E building it was already in ruins and hidden under a mass of stones which the inhabit- ants had to enclose by building the little wall parallel to the E wall of room X,11. At the S the present state of the area makes interpretation difficult. This year's work allows three phases to be identified: first, building of MM III-LM I, contemporary with quartier Delta a short distance to the SE; then from a large pit an important group of LM IIIA2-B pottery, completely compar- able to that from a pit to the W dug in 1988-89, with many decorated fragments and pieces of Chaniot pottery; finally traces of occupation of the end of LM IIIB to the beginning of LM IIIC in the form of a floor and walls of new orientation and construction. Tests were excavated in rooms X,9-18-2; XI,3-2; VII, ; IV, 1, which brought to light evidence of construction earlier than the buildings of LM III. This can be dated to MM II-a period when quartier Mu to the SW was a hive of activity-and consists of an important building with walls and floors of red plaster and rooms floored with large slabs. The MM III buildings rest directly on this level. In LM IIIA2 the area was levelled and evened off for the construction of a building at the end of the LBA. One test (X,2) brought to light a scarab inscribed in Egyptian hieroglyphs (Fig. 56). Nike 23.5.93 publishes a feature article on the site. Maromia: Exo Mouliana. Illicit excavation carried out in a hollow by the road led to excavation which revealed a tomb circuit (which had been cut by the road some 15 years ago) with M pottery. (ADelt 41 Chr, 235) Mochlos. Professors C. Davaras and J.S. Soles report on their excavations in 1992: "Work continued in three locations: on the island of Mochlos, in the area of the M settlement; in the road leading out of Mochlos to the SW towards Limanari, where an extension of the LM IB settlement has been discovered; and at the site of Chalinomouri at the E end of the Mochlos coastal plain, where a rural establishment of LM IB date is located. Work on the island focused on the excavation of the large ashlar building discovered last summer above Block B which had been excavated by Seager in 1909. More of the E and S facades of the building were uncovered, and the main entrance to the building was discovered, opening at the second story level from the street that lies on the E side of the building. It leads through a vestibule into a polythyron, paved with green schist slabs, which provided access to various parts of the building. Six or seven doorways were located around the walls of the polythyron: the main entrance from the vestibule; another that leads down a completely preserved staircase to a pillar room on the ground floor level; one or two that lead to the columnar room above the pillar room; and three in the E wall of the room leading into the interior, including one that leads to a staircase running to the third floor and to an interior doorway that opens in the direction of a kitchen area. An implivium, framed by two columns and a kemos, was dis- covered against the N wall of the polythyron. Open to the sky and provided with a substantial drain that leads under the floor through the E facade into the adjacent street, the impluvium was a major focal point in the room and in the building as a whole. Several LM IB cups were found in its drain. On the ground floor level, a second pillar room was</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1992-93 77 excavated adjacent to the one discovered in 1991; both were found to have been provided with windows in their external walls, one opening onto the street that runs along the E side of the building, and the other opening onto a narrow corridor that was created along the S side of the building by a low, irregular wall running parallel to the S facade of the building. Over 80 conical cups, many used as lamps, were found on top of this low wall or on a paved court that lies adjacent to the wall along the S side of the building. The NE and SW corers of the building were found and trenches were opened in both these areas, but were not completed. The building is the largest and the most grandly built in Mochlos; it extends all the way between the two streets that separate Seager's Blocks A from B, and B from C, and is the only ashlar building in the town. It should probably be identified as the administrative and religious centre of the LM IB settlement. Work on the island also continued to uncover various houses adjacent to the ashlar building. Excavation of the large house C.3, discovered in 1990, was completed. This house lies directly across the street from the ashlar building, and its entrance on the second floor level was very close to the entrance of the other building. Like the ashlar building, it was also three-stories high. Only its lower two stories were terraced against the hillside, however; so only these stories have survived. A staircase led up from the ground floor level to the third floor, and another staircase led down from here to the basement level. Three large storerooms, partly excavated in 1990 and 1991, were located on this level. They were so packed with pithoi, pottery and other finds that it has taken three years to complete their excavation. In one of them this year a hoard of copper ingots, bronze objects and scrap metal was found; it was apparently being saved in the storeroom to be melted down for reuse. In addition to balance pans and half of a votive double axe, it contained more than a dozen different tools, including double axes, chisels, saws, knives, awls, pincers and pins. Two of the tools, a rasp and a tool with open socket, belong to types that have never been found in the Aegean before. Traces of textile were found around many of the tools, and it appears that they had been placed in a bag. Work began on two other houses in the general area of Seager's Block C, making a total of seven new houses uncovered in this area. One, house C.6, lies to the NE of the ashlar building directly across an E-W street that runs along the N side of house C.3, and the other, C.7, lies just to the E of house C.3 on the other side of a narrow alley. Another storeroom packed with objects was discovered in C.7 and will probably require an entire season to excavate. While the main effort of the 1992 excavation concentrated on the LM IB settlement on the island, work also continued on the IB remains on the road to Limanari and at Chalinomouri. Work on the road was completed. Two buildings, separated by a narrow space, have been excavated here and then backfilled in order to permit continued use of the road. The entrance to building A was found at its W, and the entrance to building B at its E. Both buildings had industrial functions, the one serving as a centre for bronze-working and stone-vase making, and the other as a potter's workshop. Each also appears to have been provided with a small shrine, one with a bench sanctuary, and the other with a room, only partly excavated, where a votive foot was found. Both buildings continue into the adjacent field which lies to the SW, and important rooms appear to have been located here, including the room with the foot and another room, only partly excavated, which may have served as a treasury for the bench sanctuary. Most of a large rectangular building has now been uncovered at Chalinomouri, although its entrance has not yet been located and some work remains to be completed here. The building appears to have served as an agricultural outpost for the main settlement at Mochlos. It was provided with ample storage facilities, and over ten large pithoi have now been uncovered in the building, but some of the tools of stone-vase making, as well as the raw and residual materials of this industry, have also been found in the building and it may have had multiple functions. Stratified remains of the LM III reoccupation were found this summer, and the building, constructed in the LM IB period, was reoccupied with little change by later arrivals. While the excavation uncovered remains belonging largely to the LM IB period this summer, it also uncovered some earlier remains which it hopes to explore further in coming seasons in order to learn more about earlier phases of occupa- tion at Mochlos. These include a second Prepalatial house, two rooms of which were uncovered in the midst of the ashlar building. These rooms have well-stratified deposits and produced clear evidence for the distinction between EM IIA and IIB pottery styles; more deposits lie beneath which may reveal evidence for a IB foundation. An important deposit of Protopalatial pottery was found beneath the floor of a room in house C.3 and demonstrates that Mochlos continued to be occupied after its Prepalatial cemetery was abandoned."

In 1992 a team from the University of Wales, College of Cardiff, undertook for the BSA a re-investigation of the site of Praisos in E Crete, under the direction of Dr James Whitley. " This site is well known as the city of the Eteocretans, mentioned in the Odyssey and by both Strabo and Herodotus as being a people speaking a non-Greek language, known only from a few inscriptions from the site itself. The site had been briefly investigated and partially excavated by R.C. Bosanquet of the BSA in 1901, but since that time, apart from some excavation of tornbs in the vicinity, and a recent re-exploration of the third acropolis by C. Davaras, it has remained largely unexplored. The main aim of the 1992 season was to plan and describe the site: that is, the area defined by the first, second and third acropoleis. More specifically, the aim was to produce an overall plan at a scale of 1:1000 of the visible ancient remains on the site (Fig. 57). These remains consist of surviving walls of various dates, foundations of buildings, and rock-cut features including cisterns and houses. It was also intended to produce elevations (at 1:10) of selected walls, of other features cut into the rock face, and of rock-cut houses; also plans (at 1:100) of parts of the site particularly rich in ancient remains, such as the summit of the first acropolis, and two concentrations of rock-</page><page sequence="76">PRAISOS 1992 I /...... .......

Some selected features may also be planned at 1:20. The plans will be supplemented by photographic documentation of important features. These walls on the NW face of the first acropolis were of markedly different constructional techniques and therefore of very different dates. Wall 1, constructed of rectangular limestone blocks, is insufficiently regular to be described as ashlar, but is clearly of late C or HL date. It abuts a fragmen- tary earlier wall (4) of polygonal construction and possibly A date. Wall 2 appears to be 'Cyclopean', that is very similar in construction to M walls of Neopalatial date to be found at Palaikastro and Kato Zakro. Similar walls (3 and 6) are to be found on the S and E faces of the first acropolis. Wall 6 is apparently very similar to a wall used to enclose the M site at Petras. These apparently M walls frequently incorporate features in the natural rock, and, unlike other visible walls, do not appear to be part of any larger structure. They must be interpreted as either terrace or fortification walls. Wall 5 by contrast is a humble domestic wall, of small, regularly coursed rectangular blocks. It appears to be part of a structure that incorporates rock-cut features. Its constructional technique suggests a L C or HL date, and, if this is correct, would imply that rock-cut features elsewhere on the site date to this period. It is perhaps worth noting that the remains visible and those described by Bosanquet are not exactly the same. Bosanquet seems not to have noted the 'Minoan' walls on the first acrop- olis. Equally, the topographical survey of the first acropolis using the British School's EDM has found no trace of the houses and other features excavated by Bosanquet which ought to have been found on the NW slopes of the first acropolis, just SE of the so-called Andreion or Almond Tree House (see BSA 8, 1901-2, 253). It must be concluded that the recent agricultural terraces have covered over these remains, since Bosanquet had observed that most of the HL houses 'were founded on the natural rock', and there is now very little natural rock to be seen in this area. These observations allow a very tentative and preliminary history of the site to be put forward. The M walls on and around the summit of the first acropolis suggest that occupation was confined to this area in LM times, most probably begin- ning in LMIII B or C, but possible as early as LMI. Though the area enclosed was not large, perhaps no more that 100 x 100m, the size and careful construction of these walls imply that the site was, from its beginning, of a permanent charac- ter-permanent enough to be worth defending. There are few if any obvious remains of DA, and the position of the few A walls found do not suggest that the settled area expanded considerably in this period. LC and HL remains however are to be found all over the site. On the first acropolis, it is highly probably that HL terracing has cut into the disturbed earlier layers. So Praisos seems to have reached its greatest extent in the two and a half centuries before its destruction by Hiera- pytna in ca. 140 BC." Pseira. A study season was conducted in 1992, on the site and in the storeroom in Mochlos where the finds from the site are stored, under the direction of C. Davaras and Philip P. Betan- court who report: "The staff studied both the architecture on Pseira Island and the finds from the site. The main priorities for the season it included additions to the architectural plan of the town, the correction of several house plans, and the study of pottery and other finds in preparation for publication. Architectural Study. The architectural study team worked on Pseira Island. It plotted and drew the coastline of the peninsula where the main settlement is located, plotted and drew corers of buildings that are mostly buried beneath Seager's backfill, plotted elevations for building DA, and made minor corrections on the stone-by-stone plans of several buildings. Photographs were made of several buildings in anticipation of their publica- tion. Study in the Pseira Apotheki in Mochlos. Building BS/BV: this large building, named the Plateia House, was completely excavated by the modem Pseira excavations. Study of the pottery and small finds continued this season. All the pottery deposits from the structure have now been recorded, and it is anticipated that a preliminary MSS can be prepared during the winter, for checking next summer. A large group of buildings from area B will be published as a unit. The group includes a few structures that were excavated or partly excavated between 1987 and 1991 (buildings BY, BH, BN E, BW, and BC) plus over 20 buildings exposed by the 1907 excavations of Seager. The volume will be especially important for the information it provides on the provincial M architecture of E Crete. Study of pottery and small finds continued this season. Buildings AF N and AF S: the large complex of rooms called Block AF is located at the S tip of the peninsula. Its excavation was completed in 1991. Work began this season on the study of pottery and other finds, and it will continue through several future seasons. Building DA: the finds from the LM III reoccupation of Pseira were studied this season. The work will continue next summer. An unexpected find from this building consisted of ten sealings and sealing fragments from the upper fill above the building (from a mixed MM to LM III level). The finds, to be dated to MM II-LM I, had evidently been included in the fill used in the building's flat roof. Two of the sealings bear impressions of ships. Archaeological Survey. The fieldwork for the archaeological survey of Pseira Island was completed in 1991, and study of the finds is continuing." Schoinokapsala. Illicit excavation revealed a tholos tomb which was then excavated; much pottery was found (date not given, but LM by description). (ADelt 41 Chr, 234) Siteia area. In 1986 survey was carried out using EEC funds. Among the sites noted was one at Roussa Ekklesia/Kastri with a circuit wall with eight towers. Pottery collected here was A and HL; a R inscription: OIIAHTOPOX/MOPAETEOX /ZEAEYKQ is recorded. (ADelt 41 Chr, 234-5) Vasilike (AR 1991-92, 69). In Ergon 1992, 100-103 A. Zoes gives a detailed account of his latest excavation. Work was completed in room 30 of the W house; the layer on the rock contained material of the Koumasa phase and shows that this was the first occupation of the site; this was confirmed by similar tests in room 31 and in room 01 of the N house. In space PB1 more work took place on the deep sounding and produced evidence of a phase later than the Vasilike phase but earlier than MM Ia. This marks the start of wheel-made pottery on the site and can be linked to structures in P and OP; it is satisfactory that the illusive EM III period is proving more than just a pottery style. By the E gate, where a large area is available for study, evidence came to light of widespread destruction and deep, though partially disturbed, stratigraphy. Material of EM, MM and LM came to light and a structure named AI. A new pottery style 'E gate red ware' has been noted.</page><page sequence="78">80 E.B. FRENCH Particular attention was given to the R remains; a test was made in the W court where a building (An) was found, M in all building techniques except the cement mortar, but well dated by its finds. This, like the R building to the S outside the fence, can be linked to the important R Imperial complex at Ierapetra. In room 39 of the Red House the shaft was investigated, though it is overlaid by the walls of the room. It is possible that it is some form of tomb of the Koumasa period (a figurine of this period was found nearby previously). Of importance was the foundation layer below the walls which produced pottery similar to that of the Koumasa phase with no Vasilike ware and with rough cooking vessels intended to be used only once. Later phases have longer-lasting cooking wares; the excavator compares their burnished surface to modem non-stick surfaces. Vrokastro. The ASCS sends a report on the work in 1992: "Three major goals of the season were met. The second summer of study of land-use and village demographics within the survey area was completed. Architectural drawing of the several A to HL period sites was also completed (SK 1, SK 2, SK 6, KPh 3, NP 1), and two metochia within the study area were also planned (VK 8, TM 7). The remaining 45 boxes of pottery in the total collection of 92 were examined by Hayden and the remaining diagnostic sherds were catalogued and drawn. All units were described and counted, and entry of this material into a database was begun during the summer. More chronological phases were identified at several sites, and dating continues to be refined. The fabric study undertaken during the summer of 1992 should further define the material collected, especially the less diagnostic body sherds taken on transect. Possibly the most significant find of the season was the appearance of EM pottery farther inland than had previously been known. Small amounts of probable EM occurred at Prina (PN 1), at the SW edge of the survey area, and from the only significantly bulldozed site on the slopes above the Meseleri Valley (OL 8). This site is near a spring and indicates that the absence of M material from the Meseleri basin may be due to deposition of alluvium rather than to lack of settlement. A small amount of possible EM pottery was also catalogued from the terraced fields of Tzamachi on the N side of Schinavria Koriphi, at an elevation of ca. 600m. Thus previous assump- tions concerning the low-lying coastal locations of most EM sites will have to be amended on the basis of this summer's pottery study. There are also slight indications that a slight nucleation of sites began not in the LM III period, but possibly earlier, at the beginning of the Neopalatial period. At most sites, especially those which are inland, a 'Type A' fabric occurs in the cooking wares, of mixed phyllite, quartz, and granodiorite, but the evidence is not strong for a subsequent development through the existence of many recognizable Neopalatial fine-ware shapes. This may in part be due to the fact that many of these sites are rural, and primarily cooking and coarse wares have been recovered from them. Some evidence, however, suggests that many Protopalatial sites may continue into the MM III period, but perhaps not beyond this date. This potential break in the settlement pattern merits further study as the pottery analysis continues. Another factor noted in the use of inclusions in pottery fabrics within the area is the almost complete disappearance of granodiorites as deliberate temper in the wares of the EIA sites on the N coast. The continued use, therefore, of granodiorite temper in the Meseleri basin within the Gr period is of some interest. This is an area that lacks the granodiorite intrusions so frequent in the coastal zone, and may indicate a conservative element within the population of this remote, fertile inland valley. In addition to the pottery study, Zangger and Timpson began analyses of the soil and landforms within the area, and one significant conclusion was that the deposition within the Meseleri Valley is at least 3m deep. This relates directly to the lack of M settlements recovered through extensive and intensive exploration of the area. Soil depths are also being studied within the Istron River valley and in the flood plain of the river on the N side of the coastal highway. The depth and age of these debris flows are being studied in an attempt to determine how they may have affected settlement within the area, possibly burying M sites near the villages of Kalo Chorio and Pyrgos, and obscuring the S end of the important M and later settlement on the coastal promontory of Priniatikos Pyrgos. One important goal of the soil and geomorphic studies is to construct a geologic and soil map of the Vrokastro region and to key settlement locations over time into this map, in order to determine if or how settlement patterns relate to the geology of the region. Ethnographic work during the summer of 1992 included continued recording of the fieldhouses and metochia in terms of plan, size, architectural phases, room function and contents. Goals include relating the architectural history of these settlements to the pottery that has been collected from these sites, to determine the extent of the land associated with each habitation and the history of land-use for each site. These sites will also be related to ongoing soil studies." Xerokampos Zerou (AR 1991-92, 70). In 1985 a second season of work was carried out to the S of the buildings found in 1984 and a further extensive area of the HL (4th to 1st Ct BC) was cleared, comprising some 18 areas of which only two appear to have been unroofed. A notable feature was the presence of square stone receptacles in the centre of the spaces. Among copious finds were many loomweights with incised 'trademarks'. (ADelt 40 Chr, 300-301) Similar finds were made in 1986. Cleaning of the surround wall of the settlement makes certain the identification with the small walled city described by Spratt.

The problems of the excavation of a R temple are mentioned in Eleutheros Typos 5.7.92. Sphakia survey. L. Nixon (CAIA) reports: "Our season in 1992 consisted mostly of fieldwork with some finds study in the Chania Museum. As before, Lucia Nixon (University of new Brunswick of Saint John) and Jennifer Moody (MacArthur Fellow/Baylor University) co- directed; Simon Price (Oxford) continued as project historian and co-ordinator of the Sphakia Survey video, while Oliver Rackham (Cambridge) was once again our historical ecologist. During the first six weeks we finished revisiting sites dis- covered on transect. Our investigations centred on the follow- ing places: Askyphou, Loutro, Anopolis, Khora Sphakion, Kaloi Lakkoi, Frangokastello, the Madares, and Poikilasion, reached by car, on foot, with mules and by boat. Because our permit now allows us to investigate the coastal strip, we were able to pay particular attention to the coast at Loutro and Frangokastello. All told, we revisited (and discovered) 81 sites, and brought our total number of sites recorded to 218. We have greatly extended our knowledge of the Madares, the area of the White Mountains still used today for summer pasture (mostly sheep) and cheese-making. We have found 18 sites in this area, the earliest of which are FN/EM; another PR site yielded eight pieces of obsidian. One site, at 1810-1840m, is of particular interest. PR sherds (1 burnished rim/handle, ?EM/?MM 2-3 painted sherds; possible LM sherds; tripod feet) are associated with four very ruined stone structures below a spring. The structures suggest some form of seasonal occupa- tion, rather than transient use of the site by travellers. In any case this must be one of the highest large MM-LM sites in Crete. Gr-R finds from the site include A and HL/R. We continued to draw plans of anc. structures, ranging from PR to R, as well as plans and sections of later vernacular buildings and churches. We decided that Gr-R Poikilasion had no nucleated centre (but did have built bee-enclosures). And we traced the locations of property between Kaloi Lakkoi and Khora Sphakion, itemized in a document of 1435. The last three weeks of the season were spent working on our finds in the museum at Chania. We reorganised the finds so as to co- ordinate transect and revisit material; Nixon and Moody studied PR fabrics and shapes. The fabric analysis is of great importance as it will, we hope, enable us to refine our dates for much of the PR material. In October Richard Anderson (Agora Architect) began work on a plan of Loutro/Phoinix where, as has long been known, there are standing R remains, as well as much PR pottery." E.B.
