<plain_text><page sequence="1">MINORU HARA A NOTE ON THE PHRASE DHARMA-KSETRE KURU-KSETRE1 In this paper I propose an interpretation of the well-known compound dharma-ksetra, which occurs in the opening verse of the Bhagavadgïtâ. This proposal is made by suggesting the possibility of understanding the term in the sense of punya-ksetra, taking dharma- in the religious sense of "merit" instead of an ethico-legal sense (field of right, or justice)2 which has been the traditional rendering of the compound. In order to substantiate this, first, we shall ascertain the presence of the semantic field common to dharma, tapas and punya, which eventually leads us to take dharma-ksetra in the sense of punya-ksetra. Next, we shall examine the nature of Kuru-ksetra as reflected in the Epic and Purânic legends, since the compound dharma-ksetra is used as a modifier of Kuru-ksetra, the well-known centre of Vedic sacrifice3 and the holy (punya) place of Hindu pilgrimage.4 I. INTRODUCTION As is known, in the Bhagavad-gïtâ the compound dharma-ksetra appears as part of an inquiry of Dhrtarastra to Samjaya. dharma-ksetre kuru-ksetre samaveta yuyutsavah mamakah pandavaá caiva kim akurvata samjaya (MBh.6.23.1) "In the Field of Right, the Kuru-field, assembled ready to fight,5 my men and the sons of Pandu as well, what did they do, Samjaya?" (Edgerton) The same Kuru-ksetra, however, is called tapah-ksetra in the preceding part of the Mahabharata, in Vaisampayana's answer to Janamejaya's inquiry. yatha yuyudhire vîrâh kuru-pandava-somakah kuru-ksetre tapah-ksetre árnu tat prthivl-pate (MBh.6.1.2) "Listen, O lord of the earth, how those heroes, the Kurus, the Pandavas and the Somakas, fought in the Kuru-field, the field of asceticism." Here, we notice that the same Kuru-ksetra is called dharma-ksetra in the Bhagavad-gïtâ (MBh.6.23.1) as well as tapah-ksetra in MBh.6.1.2.

But we are not surprised at this juxtaposition, because we twice meet a similar use of these two words in Mâgha's Sisupâlavadha, in which the Pandava prince Yudhisthira, who is ordinarily called dharma-putra, is called a son (suta, tanüja) of tapas. vinapy asmad alam bhasnur ijyayai tapasah sutah (2.9cd) yamunam atïtam atha áuáruvan amum tapasah tanüja iti nâdhunocyate (13.1b) Mallinâtha paraphrases these as dharma-putra and dharma-nandana respectively, indicating that dharma and tapas are occasionally used as synonyms. More than a quarter of a century ago, the present writer had an opportunity to publish an article in Japanese entitled "dharma, punya, tapas=/=sukrta" and there he showed that these three words, despite their own semantic expansion,6 share the same semantic field in the sense of sukrta? Now, if Kuru-ksetra is called dharma-ksetra as well as tapah-ksetra in the Mahâbhârata, and if punya shares the same semantic field with dharma and tapas, it is to be expected that the compound punya-ksetra also might have something to do with Kuru-ksetra. This is the starting point of our discussion, but prior to entering into the main discussion, it might be convenient to give here the gist of the article in Japanese that has just been mentioned above. II. DHARMA AND TAPAS Although dharma and tapas have semantic domains of their own, these two words are occasionally used as synonyms, having the same word or concept as their counterpart. (1) Both of them have krodha as their counterpart. As tapas perishes by anger {krodha), so also man loses dharma by anger. strl vinaSyati garvena tapah krodhena nasyati (IS.7212ab) "Woman perishes by haughtiness and tapas perishes by anger." krodho hi dharmam harati yatlnam duhkha-samcitam (MBh.l.38.8ab) "Anger deprives ascetics of their dltarma, which has been laboriously accumu lated by them."</page><page sequence="3">A NOTE ON THE PHRASE DHARMA-KSETRE KURU-KSETRE 51 (2) Anger is apt to lead the ascetics to the act of cursing, that is the major discharging factor of tapas.% Thus, Krsna warned Uttañka not to submit himself to anger, lest he should lose tapas. duhkhârjitasya tapasas tasman necchami te vyayam (MBh.14.52.26cd) "I wish that you may not lose the tapas which you have earned laboriously." The same warning is given by Samlka to his son, Snigin. cara krodham imam tyaktva naivam dharmam prahasyasi (MBh.l.38.7cd) "By abandoning this anger, you will not lose dharma."9 (3) Tapas is often said to be tantamount to fasting. matam mama tu kaunteya tapo nânasanât param (MBh.13.106.3cd)10 "1 think that there is no higher tapas than fasting." The same fasting is occasionally called dharma. upavasair bahu-vidhaiS carisye dharmam uttamam (PPT.3.156cd)" "I shall practise the highest dluirma by various sorts of fasting." III. DHARMA AND PUNYA Dharma not only shares the same semantic field with tapas, but also with punya. We shall enumerate some examples to illustrate this. (1) Good kings procure for themselves the sixth-part of merit that their subjects accumulate. Two Smrtis (MS. and YS.) use dharma and punya in the same context. sarvato dharma-sadbhâgo rajño bhavati raksatah (MS.8.304ab) "The protecting king gains the sixth part of dharma from all (the subjects he protects)" punyâd api sadbhâgo bhavaty adatte nyayena paripalayan (YS.1.335ab) "While protecting he takes lawfully the sixth part of punya." (2) In MBh. the sixth part is replaced by a quarter. caturtham tasya dharmasya raja bharata vindati (MBh.12.76.6cd) caturtham tasya punyasya raja capnoti bharata (MBh.13.60.23cd)12</page><page sequence="4">52 MINORU HARA (3) In the scheme of the transfer of merit also, the two words are used as if they were synonyms. mayapy upacito dltarmas tato 'rdham pratigrhyatam (MBh.5.119.24cd) "I have also accumulated dharma, so take half of it." atithir yasya bhagnaáo grhat pratinivartate sa tasmai duskrtam dattva punyam adâya gacchati (IS.134)13 "A guest who retires from his house disappointed leaves (the house), while giving his evil act and taking punya." IV. DHARMA, TAPAS AND PUNYA If dharma shares the same semantic field with tapas on the one hand and with punya on the other, how are these three related to each other? In order to illustrate this, below I give a list of the verbs which take the three words in the accusative case. By a glance at it, we may ascertain the presence of the semantic field shared by these three words in the sense of sukrta. (1) ap putra-yogena sarpyojya krsna dharmam avapsyasi (H.69.18cd) prapsyate ca bhavan punyam dharme ca paramam sthitim (MBh.15.16.12ab) niyamair vividhair aptam tapo hi mahad asti me (R.2.110.14ab) (2) car cacara vipulam dharmam brahmacaryena samvrta (MBh.5.118.11cd) prakrstam me vayah putra punyam cïrnam yatha-balam (MBh.l5.5.15ab) tapamsi yani cTrnani carisyasi ca yat tapah (MBh.12.192.62ab) (3) ci pratyajagama svapuram dharmam caivâcinod bhráam (MBh.5.94.35cd) vrddhanam mrga-áavaksi bhrajate punya-samcayah (R.7.17.20cd Bombay) sura-rajyena viprarse devais catra tapas citam (MBh.5.106.7cd) (4) kr rsayaá cakrire dharmam yo 'nucanah sa no mahan (MBh.9.50.47cd) reme sa tam samasâdya kna-punya iva íriyam (MBh.5.116.17cd) tam tatha kurvatlm tatra tapah parama-duácaram (MBh.l 2.250.17ab) (5) ksi tasmin pratibhaye kale ksïne dharme yudhisthira (MBh.12.139.24ab) vimanebhya iva bhrastah siddhah punya-ksayâd yatha (MBh.9.22.86cd) dagdhum tapo hi ksTyen me dhaksyamïti ca parthiva (MBh.13.140.12cd)</page><page sequence="5">A NOTE ON THE PHRASE DHARMA-KSETRE KURU-KSETRE 53 (6) nas sa tan aha na me dharmo naáyed iti punar munln (MBh.9.50.45cd) na ca me pravana buddhih para-punya-vinaáane (MBh.5.119.19cd) na ca te tapaso naáarn icchami japatam vara (MBh.14.52.25ab) (7) vrdh tatha yaSo 'sya prathate dharmas caiva pravardhate (MS.11.15cd) vraja tlrthani niyatah punyam punyena vardhate (MBh.3.83.90cd) dhrtarastra mahabaho kac cit te vardhate tapah (MBh.15.35.2ab) Of these seven verbs, car- and kr- (to perform) indicate that they are the objects of practice, whereas the remaining five are indicative of their substantial aspect. Among those, vrdh- (increase), ksi- (decay) and nas (perish) suggest that they are subject to increase, decrease and finally loss. The same substantial aspects are ascertained by their construction with ap- (obtain), ci- (accumulate), for they indicate that dharma, punya and tapas are substances which can be gained and accumulated. V These two facts, that Kuru-ksetra is called dharma-ksetra as well as tapah-ksetra on one hand, and that dharma-, tapas- and punya- share the same semantic field in the sense of sukrta on the other, invite us to connect Kuru-ksetra with punya-ksetra. Curiously enough, however, the compound punya-ksetra became a technical term of religious importance in Buddhist literature. (5-1) According to PTSD. puñña-kkhetta is "field of merit, epithet of the samgha or any holy personalities, doing good (lit. planting seeds of merit) to whom is a source of future compensation to the benefactor." A passage of the Visuddhimagga suffices to illustrate this. anuttaram puñfta-kkhettam lokassa ti sabba-lokassa asadisam puñña-virühana-tthanam. Yatha hi rañño va amaccassa va sâlïnam va yavanam va virühana-tthanam rañño sali-khettam (rañño) yava-khettan ti vuccati, evam sangho sabba-lokassa puññanam virühana-tthanam, sangham nissaya hi lokassa nana-ppakara-hita-sukha-samvattanikàni puññani virühanti; tasma sangho anuttaram puñña-kkhettam lokassa ti (Visuddhimagga, PTS text, p. 220, lines 27-33) '"The world's peerless field for merit': - i.e., a place matchless for the growth of merit for the whole world. Just as the place, where the paddy or barley of the king or his minister grows, is called the king's paddy-field or barley-field, so is the Order a place for the growth of merit for the whole world. For merits (puñña) conducive to various sorts of benefit and happiness for the whole world grow by way of the Order. Hence the order is 'the world's peerless field for merit.'"14</page><page sequence="6">54 MINORU HARA (5-2) According to the Pratlka Index, the compound punya-ksetra appears thrice in MBh.13, but the Poona Critical Edition puts them into an Appendix.15 Yet, an idea comparable to the Buddhist puñña-kkhetta is found also in the Mahâbhârata. brahmano hi mahad-bhutam ksetram carati padavat ucyate tatra yad bïjam taddhi punya-phalam mahat (MBh.13.62.28) "Brahmin, the great being, is the walking field, for the seed sown there brings about great merit." Now, if semantically we can equate dharma-(ksetra) and punya (ksetra) on one hand, and if punya-ksetra has the meaning of the field productive of merit on the other, we may attribute the same productivity to the word -ksetra of dharma-ksetra. That is to say, if punya-ksetra means "the sañgha (or any holy personalities), doing good to which is a source of future compensation to the benefactor" (PTSD), we may take dharma-ksetra in the sense of "the holy place, doing good in which is a source of future compensation to the good-doer." (5-3) Besides, ksetra is not a simple "field", but "a farm" characterized by its productivity. In order to illustrate this, it suffices to quote a passage from the Manusmrti. ksetra-bhiita smrta nan bTja-bhutah smrtah puman ksetra-blja-samayogat sambhavah sarva-dehinam (MS.9.33) "By the sacred tradition the woman is declared to be the soil, the man is declared to be the seed; the production of all corporeal beings (takes place) through the union of the soil with the seed." (Biihler) Under such circumstances, we are inclined to interpret the compound dharma-ksetra not simply as "field of right" (Edgerton) or "field of Justice" (Zaehner), but as "field productive of religious merit." In order to substantiate this hypothesis, below we quote some stories related to Kuru-ksetra itself. VI. KURU-KSETRA So far we have discussed the compound dharma-ksetra, ascertaining for the first member of the compound dharma- a synonymous use with punya and for the last member -ksetra being characterized by productivity. Now, it is time to proceed to another compound Kuru-ksetra, which is modified by our compound dharma-ksetra.</page><page sequence="7">A NOTE ON THE PHRASE DHARMA-KSETRE KURU-KSETRE 55 (6-1) As has been investigated by historians and geographers,16 the place Kuru-ksetra is known as the centre of Vedic culture, which was originally founded by the pious king Kuru. (6-2) Beside dharma-ksetra, the place is also called brahma-ksetra (MBh.3.81.4),17 but there is no passage which calls it punya-ksetra, as we have seen above. Yet, the adjective punya is construed with the place Kuru-ksetra several times. First of all, the place was made punya by Kuru tasya namnabhivikhyatam prthivyam kurujangalam kuruksetram tapasa punyam cakre mahatapah (MBh. 1.89.43) "By his name, Kuru-jañgala18 became famous on the earth. The great ascetic made Kuru-ksetra auspicious by means of (his) asceticism." People call the place Kuru-ksetra holy (punya). punyam ahuh kuruksetram kuruksetrat sarasvatlm sarasvatyaá ca tïrthani tTrthebhyaá ca prthüdakam (MBh.3.81.125) "They call Kuruksetra holy, but holier than Kuruksetra is the SarasvatT, holier than the SarasvatT are the fords, holier than the fords is Prthodaka."19 It is called the most auspicious place (punyatama) in the resolute reply of Kama to Krsna who tried to seduce him. Sastrena nidhanam gacchet samrddham ksatra-mandalam kuruksetre punyatame trailokasyapi keáava (MBh.5.139.53) "Let the full circle of the baronage find their death by the sword on the Field of the Kuru, holiest in all three worlds, O Keáava." As the brahma-ksetra, Kuru-ksetra is called mahâ-punya. gandharvapsaraso yaksah pannagaá ca mahïpate brahma-ksetram maha-punyam abhigacchanti bharata (MBh.3.81.4) "(Gods, seers ... ) Gandharvas, Apsaras, Yaksas and Snakes pay their visit to Brahma-ksetra of great merit." (6-3) However, the most important among all these stories connected with Kuruksetra is that given in MBh.9.52 which relates the origin of Kuru-ksetra.20 The story goes as follows. In days of yore, here in the Northern altar (uttara-vedi) of Prajapati,21 the gods performed a great sacrifice. At that time, the great royal sage (râjarsi-vara) Kuru had cultivated this field for many years; hence it came to be called Kuru-ksetra. Since he was ever engaged in tilling this field persistently, Indra, coming down from heaven, asked him</page><page sequence="8">56 MLNORU HARA about the motive of his cultivation. The royal sage answered Indra as follows, iha ye purusah ksetre marisyanti Satakrato te gamisyanti sukrtaml lokan papa-vivarjitan (MBh.9.52.6) "Those who will die here upon this field shall proceed to the worlds of the virtuous, immune from evils." Indra, ridiculing this, went back to heaven, but Kuru did not cease to till the field. Indra came down again and repeated the same question. Kuru answered and Indra laughed at him. This took place repeatedly. Indra spoke all about this to the gods in heaven and asked them about Kuru's intention. On hearing this, the gods suggested to Indra that he stop Kuru by granting him a boon (vara), saying that if men, by only dying there, were to come to heaven (svarga) without having performed sacrifices (kratu) to them, their very existence would be endangered (11). Indra then came to Kuru and dissuaded him from tilling,22 while granting him a boon. He said, manava ye nirahara deham tyaksyanty atandritah yudhi va nihatah samyag api tiryaggata nrpa (13) te svarga-bhajo rajendra bhavantv iti mahamate (MBh.9.52.14ab) "Those human beings who will abandon their body, attentively fasting, or those who are rightly killed in battle, lying on ground23 are to be entitled to heaven, O great-minded king."24 Kuru agreed with this proposal of Indra, who went back to heaven; later he himself composed a song (gâthâ) related to Kuru-ksetra. pamsavo 'pi kuru-ksetrad vayuna samudlritah api duskrta-karmanam nayanti paramam gatim (MBh.9.52.18)25 "Even dust which is made to rise by wind from Kuru-ksetra leads an evil-doer to the highest region." The chapter concludes that not only gods, brahmins and kings, who have performed costly sacrifices here (19),26 but also all the brave27 kings, (vasumdhâdhipa) who have been killed (hata) here have proceeded to heaven (21). VII. HONOURABLE DEATH As is evident from these passages, those warriors who die in battle in Kuru-ksetra are entitled to enjoy bliss in heaven (svarga-bhâj-), as are those who commit religious suicide by fasting (nirahara). It is also said</page><page sequence="9">A NOTE ON THE PHRASE DHARMA-KSETRE KURU-KSETRE 57 that they resort to the course (gati) proper to great men (mahâtman) (MBh.9.52.21). We see here that the bliss to be enjoyed by the warriors in heaven is comparable to that of the pious Brahmins. But why are those warriors who die in battle entitled to such a privilege? In order to clarify this, we must dwell upon some epic passages. Since it was the prime duty of ksatriyas to fight bravely in battle,28 something good is to be expected for them, as long as they are engaged in a serious pursuit of their own svadharma. Hence, one secures fame in this world if he kills his enemy, or he obtains heaven, being killed by his enemy. hato 'pi labhate svargam hatva ca labhate yasah ubhayam no bahu-gunam nasti nisphalata rane (9)29 tesam kamadughaml lokan indrah samkalpayisyati indrasyatithayo hy ete bhavanti purusarsabha (10) na yajñair daksinavadbhir na tapobhir na vidyaya svargam yanti tatha martya yatha sura rane hatah (MBh.lJ.2.11) "Even killed (by his adversary), he attains heaven, and if he kills (the adver sary) he attains glory. Either way it promises many good things. No fruitlessness is ever found in battle. Indra will contrive for them regions capable of granting every wish, for they become Indra's guests. Not by sacrifices with profuse gifts, not by asceticism, not by learning, do mortals go (so speedily) to heaven as heroes slain in battle." Once departed to the front of the battle-field, a warrior was either to kill or be killed, and there was no third choice left for the noble ksatriya.30 Hence we find the recurring passage mrtyum krtvà nivartanam (making death the place of retreat) in the Mahâbhârata.31 The merit such a ksatriya gains is believed to supersede that of performing the Aávamedha sacrifice. go-brahmanârthe vikrantah samgame nidhanam gatah aávamedha-jitaml lokan prapnoti tridivalaye (MBh. 13.128.52) "A brave ksatriya who dies in battle for the sake of cow32 and Brahmin obtains in heaven the worlds to be obtained through the Aávamedha.'33 However, the reward is best vouchsaved for the warrior who dies in the Kuru-ksetra as we have seen above. Here the passage is quoted once again. Sastrena nidhanam gacchet samrddham ksatra-mandalam kuruksetre punyatame trailokasyapi keSava (MBh.5.139.53) "Let the full circle of the baronage find their death by the sword on the Kuru ksetra, holiest in all three worlds."</page><page sequence="10">58 MINORU HARA Further, battle was considered to be a sacrifice for Ksatriyas, hence such compounds as rana-yajña (MBh.2.20.15, 5.57.12, 9.59.25), ranadhvara (MBh.8.40.89), samgrama-yajña (MBh.4.23.27,12.99.12), yuddha-yajña (MBh.12.99.13) and sastra-yajña (MBh.5.139.29).34 In view of these passages, which assure in general bliss in heaven for a noble Ksatriya who dies an honourable death on the battle-field, and on Kuru-ksetra in particular, we may assume that Kuru-ksetxa is the field productive (-ksetra) of religious merit (punya or dharma=/=sukrta) for those warriors who die in the serious pursuit of svadharma. It seems to be more imbued with a religious tinge rather than to be a “field of justice." In the Glta's context it is the battle-field which promises such bliss to all the warriors who were assembled there ready to fight (samavetá yuyutsavah),35 no matter whether they fight for the Kaurava side or for the Pándava side. VIII. FU-TI This hypothesis of ours seems to find support from a description of Thaneávara by Huang Tsang,36 who visited Kuru-ksetra in 675AD. He called the place Fu-ti (福地)，champ du bonheur31 or place of religious merit^ and related the story he heard on the spot about the Bharata war. The story given by our pilgrim is not the same as we have in the Mahábhárata, but both agree in asserting the sinless nature of killing the enemy on the battle-field, and in the promise to an honourable ksatriya of bliss in heaven, as long as he fights in battle in accordance with the prescriptions of a Dharma-sütra (法経)• Though Waiters commented that “the Fu-ti of the Records cannot be regarded as a translation of dharma-ksetra, another name of the Kuru-ksetra,"39 this Chinese compound Fu-ti is nothing but a Chinese equivalent of the Sanskrit punya-ksetra.^0 If Kuru-ksetra is called dharma-ksetra (MBh.6.23.1) as well as tapah ksetra (MBh.6.2.1), the presence of the common semantic field of the three words, dharma，tapas，punya, would suggest the possibility of an application of the compound punya-ksetra to Kuru-ksetra. Though there exists no such compound in the Epic, as we have seen above, there still remains at least the possibility of understanding dharma-ksetra in the sense of punya-ksetra, "the field productive of merit, here particularly meant for the honourable warriors," as we have suggested at the begin ning of this article. The possibility seems to be strengthened by the religious significance attached to this holy {punya) place of pilgrimage</page><page sequence="11">A NOTE ON THE PHRASE DHARMA-KSETRE KURU-KSETRE 59 (;tirtha) as is revealed in ancient legends, and by the description of this ancient site given by the Chinese pilgrim. ADDENDA At this stage, it might be interesting to give a survey of the way in which the native commentators understood our compound dharma ksetra. Though Sañkara skipped over it, others, including Râmânuja, give their commentaries. We shall list them with translations.41 (9-1) Râmânuja: dharma-ksetre dharmasya sthâna-bhute samaradhavara-samucitam iti bhavah "Dharma-ksetra, the place (sthâna) of dharma: it is well-suit-ed there (to perform) battle (samara) and sacrifice (adhvara)." The compound samaràdhvara may mean "the sacrifice in the form of battle."42 (9-2) Ànandagiri: dharmasya tad-vrddheá ca ksetram abhivrddhi-kâranam yad ucyate kuruksetram iti "Since it is the field of dharma itself as well as its increase (vrddhi), Kuruksetra is called the cause of "over- increase" (abhivrddhi)." (9-3) Madhusudana: The meaning of abhivrddhi is apparently explained by Madhusudana, dharmasya purvam avidyamanasyotpatter vidyamanasya ca vrddher nimittam sasyasye va ksetram yat kuruksetram sarva-Sruti-smrti-prasiddham. "It is a fact established in all the sruti as well as smrti: the Kuruksetra is, like a field (ksetra) productive of grain, a cause (nimitta) capable of bringing forth both the rise (utpatti) of dharma which was not present before, and the increase (vrddhi) of that which was already there." Here he quotes a passage from the Jâbâla Upanisad, and continues by introducing an interpretation which describes Dhrtarâstra's hope and apprehension, atha va dharma-ksetra-mâhâtmyena papânam api mat-putranam kadacic citta-prasadah syat tada ca te 'nutaptah prakkapatopattarp rajyarp pandavebhyo yadi dadyus tarhi "(By chance,) thanks to the greatness (mâhâtmya) of dharma-ksetra, my sons, though evil, may eventually obtain serenity of mind (citta-prasada) and in full remorse they may give back to the Pandavas the kingdom they took unlawfully, then ..."</page><page sequence="12">60 MINORU HARA This is, however, rejected in another sub-commentary, the Bhasyot karsadïpikâ, as tad upeksyam "this should be ignored." (9-4) The Bhâsyotkarsadïpikâ, in its turn, also says, dharmasyopacaya-sthânatv&amp;t dharmaksetre kuruksetre sruti-smrti-loka-prasiddhe samaveta. ... "They are assembled in Kuruksetra, which is well-known in Sruti, Smrti and among ordinary people (loka). It is (called) dharma-ksetra because it is the place of accumulating dharma (dharmopacaya)." It further continues, kim aksepo 'pi dhvanitah/ayogyam kitavanta ity arthah/ dharma-ksetre himsa pradhânasya yuddhasyânucitatvât "kim (in the text) also denotes a reproach; that is to say, they did something unsuitable, because battle which inevitably involves killing is not fitting in dharma-ksetra." (9-5) Out of these interpretations in the commentary-literature, we may pick some passages which are relevant to our discussion. Kuru-ksetra as the dharma-ksetra brings about (karana, nimitta) abhivrtti of dharma, which consists of the rise (utpatti) of new dharma and the increase (vrddhi) of dharma which has been already acquired. It is the place of accumulating (upacaya-sthâna) dharma, and its productivity is compared to sasya-ksetra (field of grain). By staying there people are elevated spiritually by virtue of its sacred greatness (mâhâtmya). We have an impression that these native commentators also understood the compound dharma-ksetra more in a religious sense rather than in an ethico-legal meaning.43 TEXTS AND ABBREVIATIONS Alsdorf: L.

Kane 4, p. 682 note 1548, Law, p. 254 note 2 (though I could not trace the quotations there listed), and Bharadvaj, p. 10. (3) It is also called dharma-sthàna. samantapañcakam nama dharma-sthânam anuttamam asamantad yojanani pañca pañca ca sarvatah (VP.23.26) 2 Here are listed some important translations of the compound, heilige Feld (Garbe), le champ sacré (Senart), la sainte plaine (Lévi), Field of rightenousness (Radhakrishnan), Field of right (Edgerton), Field of justice (Zaehner), Feld der wahren Ordnung (Schreiner). 3 For the Vedic reference, cf. Macdonell and Keith, pp. 169-170 and Law, pp. 249-254. The Kuruksetra is known as the sacrificial ground of the gods (devânâm deva yajanam) and as the seat of brahman (open) to all beings (sarvesâm bhatânâm brahman-sadanam). The phrase is repeated three times in the Jábala Upanisad (Schrader, p. 59. lines 2-\, p. 60, line 1). Cf. Sprockhoff, p. 98. The phrase is quoted in the sub-commentaries of the Bhagavadglta such as the Tatparyacandrikâ (ASS.92, p. 27, lines 18-19) and Madhusûdanï (Panshikar, p. 9, line 9). 4 Cf. Dikshitar 1, pp. 406-407 and Kane 4, pp. 680-686. It was founded by Kuru</page><page sequence="15">A NOTE ON THE PHRASE DHARMA-KSETRE KURU-KSETRE 63 (H.23.107) and is equated with Ganga for its holiness (MS.8.92). Cf. also, Kane, 4, pp. 586-587 and 684. It is the purifying tïrtha. Cf. MBh.3.81.1-6, 173-176. Here we quote only two verses from the MBh. kuru-ksetram gamisyâmi kuruksetre vasâmy aham ya evam satatam brûyât so 'pi pâpaih pramucyate (MBh.3.81.2) prthivyâm naimisam punyam antarikse ca puskaram trayânâm api lokânâm kuruksetram viáisyate (MBh.3.81.173) A few verses also from the VP. apavitrah pavitro vâ sarvâvasthâm gato 'pi va yah smaret kuru-ksetram sa bâhyâbhyantarah áucih (6) kuru-ksetram gamisami kuru-ksetre vasâmy aham ity evam vàcam utsrjya sarva-pâpaih pramucyate (7) dürastho 'pi kuru-ksetre gacchâmi ca vasâmy aham evam yah satatam brûyât so 'pi papaih pramucyate (10) graha-naksatra-târânâm kâlena patanâd bhayam kuruksetre mrtânâm ca patanam naiva vidyate (SM.12.16) dürastho 'pi smared yas tu kuruksetram savâmanam so 'pi muktim avapnoti kirn punar nivasan narah (SM.15.78) kuruksetre punyatamam kuru-tïrtham dvijottamâh tam drstvâ pâpa-muktas tu param padam avâpnuyât (21) kuru-tïrthe narah snâto mukto bhavati kilbisaih kurunâ samanujñatah prâpnoti paramam padam (SM.20.22) 5 The Kashmir recension and Bhaskara have sarva-ksatra-samâ game, which has the advantage of greater stylistic effect: -ksetre -ksetre -ksatra according to van Buitenen, p. 249. For further details, see Sharma pp. 16ff. (cum lit.) Though in the sense of sukrta these three words share a common semantic field, these words have an expansion of their own, differentiating them from each other. First, punya is originally an adjective, its counterpart being papa. The noun dharma in the sense of religious merit has as its counterpart adharma, whereas tapas has nothing as its counterpart. Further differentiations may be seen in the following table. (1) tapas (1-1) First, the following adjectives are used exclusively as the modifiers to tapas: ugra, tTvra, kâsta, dar una. (1-2) Since it is originally heat, the verb of burning dah- is exclusively construed with it. (tapasâ dagdha-kilbisa) (1-3) Often, it has a bearing on vara-motif (a boon). (1-4) tapas, as the result of asceticism, is a kind of intensified power-substance, which accelerates the course of the ripening process of good-karma. That is to say, the more severe the fapas-performance, the quicker the speed by which the good-karma comes to its fruition. (2) punya Compared to tapas, punya is less powerful, severe and intense. Though punya promises to people of good conduct the attainment of heaven, it is after all ephemeral. Those people of good conduct consume their punya, while they are staying in heaven. That is to say, as long as the punya that one has accumulated on earth remains, so long is he able to stay in heaven. In the end, when punya is finally exhausted (punya-ksaya,</page><page sequence="16">64 MINORU HARA ksina-punya) they are destined to fall down from there to the earth. Constructions with ksi- (ksïna-punya, punya-ksaya) are worth noting. (3) dharma Dliarma, on the other hand, is characterised by solidity. (3-1) Though like punya also leads good men to heaven, dharma is often furnished with personality. It is styled as a companion (sahâya), who accompanies the good doers after death and leads them to heaven. Anthropomorphism is peculiar to dharma, and it often tests a man in disguise. It protects the good people. (3-2) In contrast to punya which is apt to decay (ksaya), dharma is eternal. 7 Hara 1975, pp. 507-544. 8 Cf. Hara 1997. 9 For this story, cf.
