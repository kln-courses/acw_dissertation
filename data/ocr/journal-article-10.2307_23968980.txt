<plain_text><page sequence="1">Between Between Heaven and Earth. Divine Presence and Absence in the the Book of Ezekiel. By John F. Kutsko. Pp. xiv+185. (Biblical and Judaic Studies from the University of California, San Diego, 7.) Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2000. ISBN ι 57506041 8. $29.50. This study (a revision of the author's Harvard PhD dissertation) explores the paradox of divine presence and absence as a central theme of the book of Ezekiel. Its development is rooted in some of the tough questions the Babylonian exiles faced: 'Why have we suffered exile? How can God both abandon Jerusalem and be present with his people? Has God any power to help us?' Kutsko's first chapter lays out the basic questions he seeks to address, and also defends (as he offers a review of relevant liter ature) the three important premises on which his argument is built. These are (a) the literary and theological coherence of the book of Ezekiel; (b) the influence upon the prophet of other traditions now found in the Hebrew Bible; and (c) the Babylonian setting of the book and the prophet's 'conscious interaction' with aspects of Mesopotamian tradition (p. 5).</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 179 Chapter two, the first of three separate but related case studies, examines Ezekiel's polemic against idolatry, which forms the prophet's principal explanation of Yahweh's withdrawal from the Temple and Jerusalem's consequent destruction. This polemic is for Kutsko more than a mere condemnation of graven images and their worshippers. The language it uses, dominated by the scato logical term gillulim and by a refusal to dignify the objects of false worship with the name 'gods', undermines any claims to power made on behalf of divine images. Idols may be present but are powerless: Yahweh may appear absent but has power. The hopeful implication is that Yahweh controls Israel's destiny, not the gods of the Babylonian conquerors. Kutsko here makes a compelling case that Ezekiel's monotheism is more consistent and theoretically grounded than has hitherto been recognized. More contentious is his claim that Ezekiel shares the Priestly doctrine of human beings as created in the image of God, and that this theology underpins both his attack on idolatry and his condemnation of bloodshed. It is an attractive suggestion, and indeed essential to the development of Kutsko's argument in later chapters. However, despite the highly anthropomorphic 'appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh' (1:28; cf. 1:26, 8:2), the parallel concept of humanity as the imago dei is nowhere explicit in the text of Ezekiel (as Kutsko himself admits). The evidence from which he infers the prophet's familiarity with it may strike some readers as rather too circumstantial. If idols are illegitimate representations of God, what form might legitimate ones take? Kutsko's third chapter examines Ezekiel's alternative to idolatry, focusing on his creative adapta tion of Israel's Temple and wilderness traditions to meet the needs of exile. With its combination of utter transcendence and bold anthropomorphism, Ezekiel's vision of Yahweh's mobile kabod is able effectively to express both God's removal of himself from a defiled Temple and his continued availability to his people. For the exiles it could provide 'a theology of God's presence that transcended the physical representation of God but nevertheless effectively underscored the objective reality of God's presence' (pp. 99-100). The fourth chapter turns to Ezekiel's vision of the future, where Kutsko finds a subtle but incisive assault on the Mesopotamian imperial tradition. He describes the stereotypical Assyro-Babylon ian policy towards the cult statues of defeated enemies: con querors would first exile these images along with their worshippers, then repair and clean them, and ultimately return</page><page sequence="3">180 REVIEWS them to their homeland. Kutsko sees these pattern replicated and parodied in the structure of Ezekiel, with its central motifs of divine abandonment and return. It is especially prominent in chapters 36—7, where imagery like that of cleansing (36:25—7), of the replacement of idolatrous hearts of stone with obedient hearts of flesh (36:26), and of re-creation and revivification (esp. 37:1—14) are deliberately suggestive of the repair of images in the Babylonian ideology. For Ezekiel too this is the prelude to restora tion, but human beings—the people of Israel—are the divine images which are restored, and Yahweh the conquering king. This subversion of the dominant ideology reinforces both the rejection of idolatry and the monotheistic worldview that under lies that rejection: 'the Mesopotamians conceive that man creates and restores gods, but Israel now knows that Yahweh creates and restores man. Israel is cleansed of idols and re-created in a fashion that belies their efficacy' (p. 153). Between Between Heaven and Earth is a thoroughly researched, carefully argued, and highly creative study, which offers much food for thought and deserves to be widely read. Kutsko has undoubtedly identified a significant theme within the structure and theology of the book, and offered a plausible model for Ezekiel's appropri ation of both Israelite and Mesopotamian theological traditions. Beyond this, he has increased our appreciation of Ezekiel's theological sophistication and depth, and has opened up a number of potentially fruitful avenues for further work.
