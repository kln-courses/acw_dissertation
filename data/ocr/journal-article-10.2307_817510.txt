<plain_text><page sequence="1">The New Literacy: Television, Purveyor of Modern Myth Harold M. Foster If television is such a waste of time, why do so many people watch so much? Marie Winn suggests that television serves as a drug that puts the viewer into a stupor, a sleep that lowers brain activity to a level of hybernation. But why do so many people need this state so often? If television is the boob tube, if TV is the wasteland, why is it in constant use? Myth and TV The answer may be that television fulfills a deeper need than most viewers realize. Television may be the major modern source of the mythological nourishment most people require. Myth here does not mean fabricated story or lie. Nor does it merely refer to tall tales such as Paul Bunyan. By myth, I mean the following: . dramatic stories that form a sacred charter either authorizing the continuance of ancient institutions, customs, rites and beliefs in the area where they are current, or approving alterations (Patai, 1972, p. 2). The power of myth derives partially from two characteristics. First, myths are parables that con- vey their deeper meanings-the messages that shape human behavior-directly through the sub- conscious. In myth, narrative is not as psychologi- cally meaningful as are images or symbols or themes, although plot is the only element that many people retain in their conscious memory. Second, people encounter the same myths over and over again. Although the story or dramatic forms are always changing, underlying themes re- main stable and are repeated. A prime example is in religious mythology where repetition occurs in daily prayer, weekly services, and yearly holidays. The combination of subconscious messages and 26 English Journal repetition make myth so powerful that it has been characterized as frightening (Patai, 1972). And myth is universal-the collective dreams of hu- manity, wrote a New York psychoanalyst. "We know today that if a subject is prevented from dreaming for any length of time, he may develop psychotic manifestations" (Kilgruss, 1974, p. 525). Bruno Bettleheim noted "the similarities between the fantastic events in myths and fairy tales and those in adult dreams and daydreams" (1977, p. 35). Many indicators point to television as a prime conveyor of modern mythology. For instance, if nmyths displace dreams, so does television. The more one watches television, the less one may dream (Adler and Cater, 1976, p. 19). And, if myths are similar to dreams, so is television. Both TV and dreams have a high visual quality. Both TV and dreams are highly symbolic. Both TV and dreams involve a high degree of wish- fulfillment. Both TV and dreams appear to contain much that is disjointed and trivial. Both TV and dreams have an enormous and power- ful content, most of which is readily and thoroughly forgotten. Finally, both TV and dreams make consistent use, overt and disguised, of materials drawn from recent experience (Adler and Cater, 1976, pp. 21-23). Also, like myths, television has powerful influ- ence on shaping human behavior. "We can be forgiven," Michael Novak wrote, "if we do not yet understand all the ways in which the medium has altered us, particularly our inner selves: the perceiving, mythic, symbolic, and the judging, critical parts of ourselves" (1975, p. 9).</page><page sequence="2">The source and nature of the myth determines how positive the myth is for society and the indi- vidual. The myths of major religions are often considered to be moral and beneficial to society, but the myths of Nazi Germany were incredibly destructive. Myth and Commercials Myths spawned by television are varied with a wide range of ethical, political, social, and eco- nomic themes. However, some of the most power- ful myths on television are controlled by large corporations and are aimed at turning viewers into perfect consumers. Much of the manipulative quality of television commercials can be attributed to the conscious use of mythological structure. For instance, commercials on television often contain the "mythic hero," the "superhuman," almost divine, providing an instantaneous, some- times magical solution to a problem. The form of this superhero varies. It may be Madge who pro- vides the elixir of youth, the detergent that keeps the middle-aged housewife's hands eternally young. It may be Robert Young, who achieved superhero status as Dr. Welby and has retained that status (not long ago, The University of Michigan Med- ical School invited the eminent television doctor to speak at its commencement) while providing the secret of serenity and peace, the magic of decaffeinated coffee. Often the superhero is a scientist-type who through objective, clinical research provides the potency of the product. Since science has the highest mythic stature in society, blind faith in anything seemingly scientific can lead viwers to buy almost anything. Thus, the gray-haired man in the white coat reports that Cheer is proven to be a better whitener. Or the serious looking man in the business suit conducts an experiment on camera that proves that Topol is the smoker's tooth polish. Or, the superhero may take an anthropomorphic form, an animated Mr. Peanut who has the magical ability to whisk a middle- class couple from their living room to a beach in Acapulco in a "Dream Vacation" contest. The Mythic Quest and Commercials The quest is an important narrative of mythology, and television commercials use the quest exten- sively. However, the major quest in television commercials is the quest for cleanliness. Day after day the fear of a yellow floor, a smudged wall, a stained sink, a dirty table is hauntingly chanted by a chorus of voices. This chorus raises its voices in joy at a clean toilet, a lint-free rug, a clear window. The quest includes the endless search for the state of perfect personal hygiene. The tragedy of a dirty shirt collar can only be matched by the horror of bad breath or underarm odor. Fulfillment lies in white teeth and clean hair. This compulsive drive for cleanliness instilled in television viewers goes far beyond any normal desire for healthy, sanitary living conditions. This bizarre quest has been elevated to a mythic di- mension for one reason. American corporations make cleaning paraphernalia and need to make people irrationally terrified of dirt to sell it. The virtues of personal hygiene and cleanliness have been transformed into an absurd, mindless, mythic, compulsive ritual. Other television-inspired mythic quests may be dangerous because they are unrealistic, require great personal changes, and instill guilt. For in- stance, even if a person eats bran, takes vitamins, and joins in a health spa, it is still possible to become ill. A nonsmoker can get lung cancer and an athlete can have a heart attack. But how much blame do victims of disease place on themselves? According to Susan Sontag, much too much (Son- tag, 1978). Yet, television promises good health, if only . . . . Rationally, most viewers know that liv- ing a healthy life is not always enough, but myth does not work solely on rational faculties, and guilt with illness is a serious psychological prob- lem in society. The quest for youth and beauty depicted on tel- evision commercials obviously holds false prom- ises. No matter what jeans people buy, they still grow old (if not up), and people will look as they were born to look. That's not quite the Holly- wood star image television guarantees to those using the right magic formula on the hair. Television promises its mortal viewers a magic transformation-youth, love, joy-by embibing the nectar of the gods. Soft drink commercials, primarily Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, are filled with the images of sexy youthfulness, a promise of one of our "oldest dreams," the magic fountain that spouts the elixir of "health, youth, happi- ness, and immortality" (Patai, 1972). But beer commercials also promise magic results. Lite Beer promises macho, Lowenbrau promises sophistica- tion, and Genesse promises beautiful women. February 1984 27</page><page sequence="3">The most enduring and powerful myth on tele- vision is in a state of flux and confusion. The energy crisis intruded on the ultimate American success symbol-the automobile, the quintessence of power and sex (the Lynx, Bobcat, Cougar, Mustang, Fury). But as the industry falls into de- pression, the confusion is represented by lifeless, sexless television ads. The powers who control television do not care whether viewers watch prime time TV. What is important is that viewers watch commercials. Thus, more imagination, thought, power, and myth, go into commercials. And just enough en- ergy, plot, creativity, and myth go into prime time television to keep people interested until the im- portant stuff comes on. Television programs are not made to interfere or compete with the involve- ment that commercials demand. When people watch television, chattering often decreases and attention increases when the commercial appears. Does this imply that most prime times shows are intentionally bland so viewers will not resent commercial interruptions? Perhaps so. Los Angelizing America The myth that seems to dominate prime time shows and has seeped into this country's psyche is the "Los Angelizing of America." Inclement weather is shown almost nowhere on prime time. No snow falls on the Milwaukee of "Laverne and Shirley" or on the Cincinnati of "WKRP in Cin- cinnati." A viewer may easily believe that Denver has no winters after watching "Dynasty." Weather becomes mythic for television viewers who associate happiness and fulfillment with sub- tropical climates. A major non-economic factor for migration to the sunbelt may be the myth of good weather depicted on television. The TV landscape creates the Southern Cali- fornia myth. Viewers seldom see Appalachian- type hills, great Northwestern mountains, large Midwestern wheat fields, skyscrapered Northern cities, huge industrial complexes. What viewers see are the wide streets, stucco houses, occasional palm trees, and flat landscape of Los Angeles. What we see on TV and what we see out our windows do not match. Yet for many, the way America is supposed to look according to the myth of television is a powerful indictment on the way America really does look. The "Los Angelizing of America" has two causes: first, writers write about what they know, 28 English Journal and since most television writers live in Los Ange- les, they write about Los Angeles. Second, location shooting is expensive, but shooting at home is cheap. Home for all major television production companies is Los Angeles (Stein, 1979), and ho- mogeneity produces homogeneous programming. Prime time television programs are basically alike. "There is no major difference in texture or atti- tude between a 'Baretta' or a 'Happy Days,"' Benjamin Stein laments. "No prime time show challenges the assumption that the unexamined life is the only life worth living" (1979, p. 106). The TV Anchor as Mythic Figure The other major prime time television myth is the myth of force and violence. Television super- heroes solve superproblems with superviolence. Whether it's the Incredible Hulk or the Fall Guy, they do it the same way, violently, and society is beginning to feel it. Violence has taken hold. Students support it; experience shows it (Jewett and Lawrence, 1979). Network news is often considered the most credible feature of television, as far from myth as Oedipus Rex is from news. It is serious in manner; written, edited, and produced by real and capable news people; informative and interesting. "That's the way it is," Walter Cronkite used to tell the viewers, and the viewers believed him. Yet an analyst need not probe too deeply to penetrate the mythic core of news-the superhero anchor- person. Although Dan Rather is reading a story about the President, it is Dan Rather's image that fills the screen. The President's face is in a tiny box in the corner behind Rather's shoulder. The mythic content of this scene reenacted seven days a week is clear-the picture stays with the viewer after the words are forgotten. This mythic newscaster and anchorperson (a perfect term for the stabilizing force in the tem- pestuous sea of news) is similar to the mythic television doctor. He (seldom, as yet, a she) must keep viewers calm no matter how bad the news. As long as Anchorperson X appears every 6:30 pm, viewers believe there's a guarantee of tranquility and stability. Unfortunately for the networks, few individuals can create that magic impression with a huge audience, so the people who do can de- mand enormous salaries. Roger Mudd has the quality. Mike Wallace doesn't. The jury is still out on Dan Rather. The best of them, of course, was Walter Cronkite, more trusted than the Pres- ident or any member of Congress.</page><page sequence="4">Although TV anchors are the prime heroic personalities emphasized on the three networks' evening newscast, they are by no means the only heroic personalities. Network news glorifies many personalities. The stories that unfold are told by hero anchors about hero politicians. Political leaders, "particularly the President, are an omnip- otent elite. The Greek gods were no less remote and only slightly more powerful" (Smith, 1979, p. 82). The glorification of the heroic has been char- acterized by Sharon Lynn Sperry as humanity's "simplest and most persuasive myth." According to Sperry, television is governed not by a political bias, but rather by a "melodramatic bias" (Law- rence and Timberg, 1979, p. 322). This is the stuff that attracts an audience, whether it's an audience for entertainment programs or an audience for news. And massive audiences is what TV is all about, even for the news. TV Myth Requires the Obvious Thus, the mythic dimension of newscasts requires an emphasis on these stories: good people battling evil people; good nations battling evil nations; a decisive and powerful President. Ambiguous stories without clear moral tone are bad myths. So are deeds accomplished slowly and thoughtfully and ambiguous events without clear heroes. Wars provide good mythology, whether in the Midwest or in South America, because war has direct, deci- sive, heroic action. All rescue missions, such as the Israeli raid on Entebbe, are good myth (Lawrence and Timberg, 1979, p. 326). All acts of terrorism are good myth because good and evil seem clearly defined. All Presidential actions are good myth because of the heroic or evil character at the heart of each. Economic news is generally bad myth unless the story has a central personality, whether it's David Stockman or an unemployed steelworker. And when economic news is given, it is usually presented in terms of good news or bad news. Ambiguous economic news is terrible myth, guar- anteed to bore a mass audience. Supreme Court and Congressional actions are bad myth without central heroic or evil characters and without deliberate action. When there is a central character and clear moral action, such as Senator Harrison Williams' participation in the Abscam scandal, the myth works and makes the news. "In short," Lawrence and Timberg wrote, "We must conclude that mythic adequacy is one im- portant criteria of news worthiness" (1979, p. 328). News will misshape the world to fit the mythic formula. So viewers get the image of a President not co-equal in power to the other two branches of government but far more powerful. The public expects economic conditions to be controllable even if they are too complicated to be predictable or shaped. Audiences are overwhelmed by person- ality and underwhelmed by thoughtfulness, col- lective action, and planning. News prepares an audience for a simple and manageable world, and when time after time the world proves unpre- dictable and uncontrollable, viewers become frus- trated and angry. Most viewers don't realize the closeness in format of television news and tele- vision entertainment programs (Novak, 1975), but they both rely on a mythic structure to build a mass audience. The Claus Von Bulow murder case is only one recent striking example of a story given news coverage because of its mythic elements. Von Bulow was convicted of murdering his socialite wife by injecting her with an insulin overdose- his classic motive, to get his wife's money so he could live happily ever after with his lover. All networks had a major correspondent covering the trial and nightly regaling us with a decadent tale of wealth, passion, and murder-perfect mythic material. Yet, we gained no knowledge or under- standing of the world from this lurid but worth- less story. Myth and Sports Finally, viewers receive an enormous amount of mythic nourishment from TV sports. Sports has always been mythic in nature with sports heroes always idolized, perhaps in some ways more so before television. Sports has always had special rules and rituals. Baseball has always been the game of summer, providing Americans with that special sense of timeliness and serving as a meta- "phor for individual success. But football has been given a special mythic status by television. Football is the myth of cor- porate America. "The equation is drawn between football and business, the viewer is reassured that the system really works, for he sees actors being dispassionately and accurately monitored and re- warded according to the merits of their perfor- mance" (Montague and Morais, 1976, p. 43). February 1984 29</page><page sequence="5">Television and football have combined to form the largest mass myth in contemporary America- Super Sunday. Out of nothing, television networks and football leagues created a day, almost a mass religious holiday, when the two most successful and heroic teams clash to determine which is most successful, which is the most heroic, which is the best-"We're Number One!" The Superbowl has mythic dimensions as large as any mythological battle or story ever dragged through time. The Superbowl, held on Super Sunday during Super Week, is the ultimate mod- ern myth of winning and success. It is the ultimate statement of the American dream, untold glory achieved through fair and honest competition. On Monday, Americans plod back to their jobs, back to their lives, mundane by comparison, myth- ically nourished. Americans will live with television and its so- phisticated offspring from now until forever, but to live comfortably and profitably with this intru- sion in their homes and lives, we must understand it. Dismissing television as a brief respite does not adequately explain its hold on our time or our imagination. If we become perceptive viewers, if we understand how television locks in on our unconscious with its use of primal mythological stories and powerful ritual narratives that are meant to shape and control behavior, then maybe we can withstand this primitive bombardment. We need myth, but not all myth shapes us in ways we would consciously hope to be shaped. Television is a force that requires learning to con- trol it. Otherwise we may lose control of our own actions. Myth is powerful. Myth on television is even more powerful. It will take powerful knowl- edge and understanding for us to learn properly how to use and benefit from television. References Adler, Richard and Douglass Cater. Television as a Cultural Force.
