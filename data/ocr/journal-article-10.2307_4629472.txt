<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foms of the Goddess Lajjia Gaufi in Indian Art. By Carol Radcliffe Bolon. Monographs on the Fine Arts Spon- sored by the College Art Association, vol. 49. 89 + xi pp., 1 map, 128 figures. University Park, Pa.: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1992. $47.50. Many technical and sacred texts contain iconographic information and devote substantial space to recording the appropriate gestures, attributes, and proportions of divine and semidivine images. The publication of this literature, at times with instructive commentary, is well advanced in India, and some of this information has been incorporated into handbooks on iconogra- phy.' This type of scholarship, tending to the descrip- tive rather than the interpretive, focuses on forms preserved in the literary record and thus still canonical in the strictest sense. An obvious example isVigSu in his supernal form ViAvarapa. Most readers of this journal will need no introduction to the Bhagvad Gitai and the stunning theophanycelebrated in its eleventh chapter. Similar texts praising Siva or the goddess could be cited. Such examples form part of the upper strata and great tradition of Hinduism; the images are recogniz- able and are, in many cases, still produced in sculpture, painting, and popular prints. Some deities, however, have fallen from favor, and their forms are no longer made or worshipped. These deities have tended to disappear from literary accounts, though fossilized or incidental references are occasionally preserved. Cer- tainly, the best-known instance of this phenomenon is provided by early Buddhist art in north India. Al- though the apparentworship of trees and other objects shown in the early reliefs seemed quite baffling when first examined in the nineteenth century, a study of inscriptions and Buddhist texts led to a remarkably thorough understanding of this sculpture and its icon- ographic peculiarities. This approach, which we might describe as an "archaeology of interpretation," was pioneered by Ananda Coomaraswamy and has been carried forward by such scholars as Moti Chandra and V. S. Agrawala.2 It is to this interpretive tradition that Bolon's monograph belongs. What is significantly dif- ferent here is that the author has tackled an icono- graphic form for which there seems to be no textual or epigraphic documentation. The images surveyed by Bolon are striking and quick- ly described: the goddess is shown recumbentwith her legs splayed to reveal her private parts; in lieu of a head, most depictions show a lotus flower and other vegetal motifs. For this representation Bolon uses the name Laiia Gauri. The surprisingly wide distribution and large number of these images indicate that this goddess was not a minor deity but part of an important and widespread cult. This is significant in itself because we are apt to forget that Hinduism has changed dramati- cally in the last millennium. Lajja GaurT was wor- shipped in many parts of the country but seems to have enjoyed special favor in the Deccan. It is curious that no images were found in eastern India, but examples may yet be discovered. Due to the apparent absence of textual sources, Bolon focuses on the archaeological record, which consists of about 120 stone and terracotta examples widely scattered among public and private collections, religious establishments, and archaeological stores. Only one example, at Alampur, remains in situ in a temple sanctum (fig. 46). Many examples are small and fragmentary, indicating that the author has left, literal- ly, no stone unturned. Anyone who has attempted work of this nature will appreciate the pains to which Bolon has gone; those with special interests in Hinduism and the goddess are very much in her debt. The surviving images are divided into four basic types: 1) a form with a pot-like body and splayed legs on each side; lotus flowers and plant sprays issue from the pot's mouth; 2) a form with a pot-like body that in- cludes shoulders and breasts; the floral and vegetal devices in this type are placed where the head might be expected; 3) a form in which arms have been added but which retains a lotus flower in lieu of a head; 4) a completely anthropomorphic form with all four limbs and a head. The first type is the most archaic</page><page sequence="2">160 BOOK REVIEWS in typological terms and shows that the womb was equated with the pirnakumnbha, or pot of plenty. This indicates that the goddess was an image of fertility and the source of life, a point the author rightly stresses. The four types appeared concomitantly and do not, therefore, constitute a temporal development. After a typological classification of the various forms (chap. 1), the author discusses examples that appear in multifigured plaques (chap. 2). These help determine that the cultic associations of the goddess were consis- tently Saiva. Related forms are then discussed (chap. 3). Of these the lotus is obviously the most important as itwas used instead of a head in manyof the images. The names of Laiia Gauri, most of them popular and of little historical value, are dealt with in chapter 4. The conclusion, which I think readers will find the most stimulating and provocative part of the book, explores the possible origins of this goddess and the various social and historical conditions that seem to have led to her anthropomorphization and incorporation into the Saiva pantheon. While much of this is necessarily spec- ulative, the ideas are nonetheless presented with due caution and with a genuine sensitivity to the religious life of India. Flights of theoretical fancy are avoided, something especially laudable given the monograph was produced in 1992 under the auspices of the College Art Association of America. Should we have any criticism of this book, it is the desultory treatment of literary references that might help explain this goddess. StellaKramrisch was the first to propose that Laiia GaurT could be equated with Aditi uttiinapad.3 Bolon agrees that the word uttanapad "ex- actly describes this image" and mentions some of the early texts where the term occurs (p. 6). Her referenc- es, however, simply repeat what is found in M. Monier- Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Oxford: Claren- don Press, 1899). While it may well be that these references shed no light on the topic, the author cannot assert there are no texts to explain the images (as is done on p. 8) without discussing the occurrences of uttanapad. For example, Sayaija's commentary on ?gveda 10.72.4 states: bhuih uttiinapadah v.rkstjajnie.4 WhySaya)a has introduced v.rksat ("from a tree") is not immediately clear, but this would seem to have some bearing on the subject, considering the vegetal associ- ations of the goddess; the passage, in any case, under- lines the need to explore the texts in a systematic and comprehensive manner. A related question centers on Bolon's use of the term utttinapad and identification of Lajja Gauri with Aditi (p. 65). Given that this goddess was understood, atleast in part, asAditi and thus can be traced to the most revered Vedic texts, I found it difficult to follow why Laiia GaurT was then considered a rustic village goddess who came to be absorbed into the pantheon of Hinduism (p. 68). This contradiction is not satisfactorily resolved or explained. How the Vedic deities find their place in Hinduism is indeed most interesting and worthy of exploration, but the work of Eschmann et al. on the cult of Jagannatha, which is used here as a model, is helpful only in exploring the final history of this goddess, when she seems to have enjoyed a degree of noble patronage.5 A related matter, perhaps only of interest to pedants like me, are the errors in transcription that appear most conspicuously (and unfortunately) in the glossary (pp. 77-80): astamanigala for astamangala, bhiumiprasada for bhuimipriisAda, kund for kund, pi tha for pitha, PTthvT for PTthivT, Ramaiyana for Ramayana, siakti pitha for sakti pttha, vapi for vapi. Also, the arched projection that is placed against a temple spire over the entrance is a not a sukhanasa but a sukanasa (literally "parrot's beak"). Some of the decisions regarding transcription are pe- culiar to my mind, such as the absence of diacritical marks on place names and the use of ch for c chaitya for caitya, Chola for C6Ja, and so forth. The use of chcan be defended in that it helps readers unfamiliar with Indic languages. This monograph, however, is not designed for popular consumption in either style or subject matter so the use of ch is inconsistentwith the volume's general tone. I have to admit that I was also surprised to see a comment regarding the "corruption of Victori- an attitudes, which led to an outcast status for LajA Gauri" (p. 67). Surely, these same Victorian attitudes, and British Orientalism in general, led to the serious study of ancient India and ultimately to the archaeolog- ical organizations and museums that have preserved the images of this important goddess. We should be sufficiently distanced from the imperial enterprise to look dispassionately at the Indo-British encounter.6 Notes 1. The best-known "classics" are perhaps T. A.

Sompura (Ahmedabad: B. P. Sompura and Brothers [ 1967]). These Sanskrit works have Gujarati commentary (the second with it also translated into Hindi). 2.
