<plain_text><page sequence="1">Graphic Narratives and Narrative Theory Introduction Jared Gardner and David Herman This special issue assembles an international group of scholars to explore emerging connections between comics studies and narrative theory - two fields which, until the last five to ten years, have developed largely in parallel, without much cross-fertilization or even interaction. The signs of this new convergence of scholarly interests and research practices are unmistakable. Recent meetings of the Modern Language Association, the American Comparative Literature Association, and the International Society for the Study of Narrative have increasingly featured papers and sessions on the intersections between scholarship on narrative and research on comics and graphic novels. Further, recent publications have featured narratologically oriented work by analysts of graphic nar- rative, including Jeanne Ewert's and Erin McGlothlin's path breaking studies of Art Spiegelman's Maus, Pascal Lefevre's analysis of "Narration in Comics" in the inaugural issue of Image [&amp;] Narrative , Teresa Bridge- man's work on bande dessinee, and Richard Walsh's discussion of "The Narrative Imagination across Media" in Modern Fiction Studies' special issue on "Graphic Narrative" (2006). In Francophone scholarship, there is a longstanding tradition of studying comics using semiotic concepts, which are part of the foundation for contemporary narratology. This tradition reached something of a culmination in Thierry Groensteen's recently translated monograph The System of Comics (discussed by Craig Fischer and Charles Hatfield in this issue). Yet for all of these incipient cross-disciplinary connections, the present issue is the first of its kind: a sustained, multi-author study organized around the question of how ideas from contemporary narrative theory can be brought to bear on graphic narratives, and how, reciprocally, the richness and complexity of narratives told in words and images might pose challenges to existing models of story. We use the term graphic narrative theory as a shorthand for the new, hybridized field of study in which questions of this kind are central, and which the essays gathered here collectively work to promote. In this introduction, we provide context for understanding the ongoing disciplinary reconfiguration - the continuing expansion of in- terest in storytelling via words and images - that has made this special Â© Board of Regents, University of Wisconsin System, 2011 3 SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="2">4 Jared Gardner and David Herman issue possible. Synopsizing the major lines of inquiry pursued by each contributor, we highlight questions that will require further investigation as comics scholars and narrative theorists work to open new avenues for exchange on graphic narrative theory. Our aim is to foster more dialogue of this sort, facilitating new ways of engaging with what has become, cross-culturally, one of the world's most vibrant and compelling forms of narrative practice. Graphic Narrative Theory's Two Trajectories of Development The study of graphic narratives and research on narrative theory: it seems like a natural fit! Aren't these two made for each other, as the specific case is made for the general category, the local practice for the broader protocols that enable and regulate it? In fact, the situation is more complicated, and characterizing the scope and aims of the present issue requires sketching out a brief history of the two fields at whose intersection graphic narrative theory has emerged. In both fields, longer trajectories of development have set the stage for the convergence of texts and traditions exemplified by the present issue. Scholars working in the field of narrative theory have come to recognize the need to diversify the corpus of narrative texts - the range of storytelling practices - on the basis of which they seek to develop ac- counts of what stories are, how they work, and what they can be used to do. To quote Gerald Prince, in his discussion of how a focus on female- authored texts might impact work in narratology, "it can be argued that a modification of the narratological corpus [e.g., an inclusion of more texts by women]... may effect the very models produced by narratology; and, should it turn out that such a change does not lead to an alteration of the models, the latter would be all the more credible, all the less open to negative criticism" (78). As part of this broader reassessment of the way theories of narrative are based on specific corpora of stories, and how the stories included therein then shape analysts' claims about the forms and functions of narrative itself, questions about storytelling media have now moved to the forefront of narratological research. The issue is whether a consideration of narratives presented in a variety of media might likewise require a recontextualization and recalibration of existing methods for the study of stories.1 Hence the turn to graphic storytelling by narrative ana- lysts can be seen as an organic outgrowth of the continuing reflection on issues of methodology - in particular, the fit between corpus and theory. Indeed, to anticipate remarks developed more fully in David Her- man's contribution to this issue, considerations of storytelling media form a major part of the rethinking of classical, structuralist methods for narrative research now being conducted under the auspices of "post- classical narratology," or frameworks for narrative inquiry that build on SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="3">Graphic Narratives: Introduction 5 structuralist models but supplement those models with ideas unavailable to earlier theorists, who founded the field of narratology in the mid- to late 1960s. Structuralist theorists of narrative arguably failed to come to terms with how narrative practices might be shaped by the expressive capacities of a given semiotic environment, as demonstrated by Claude Bremond's claim, in his 1964 article "Le message narratif," that "any sort of narrative message [...] may be transposed from one to another medium without losing its essential properties: die subject of a story may serve as an argument for a ballet, that of a novel can be transposed to stage or screen, one can recount in words a film to someone who has not seen it" (quoted in Chatman, Story and Discourse 20). By contrast, in working to develop a transmedial narratology - that is, a framework for studying narrative across media - scholars now focus on how the constraints and affordances associated with particular media may affect the design and interpretation of narratives (see Herman, "Transmedial Narratology," and Ryan; see also Kukkonen's and Lef&amp;vre's contributions to this issue). Taking issue with arguments such as Bremond's, transmedial narratology disputes the no- tion that th efabula or story level of a narrative - the sequence of situations and events that interpreters work to reconstruct via information presented at the sjuzhet or discourse level - remains wholly invariant across shifts of medium. Instead, the assumption is that stories have "gists" that can be remediated more or less fully and recognizably - depending in part on the semiotic properties of the source and target media. From this perspective, contemporary narratology' s engagement with graphic narratives is part of a wider attempt to come to terms with the narrative possibilities presented by various storytelling environments. Insofar as graphic narratives can be situated in a larger class of multimo- dal narratives, or stories that exploit more than one semiotic channel to evoke a narrative world (Herman, "Word-Image /Utterance-Gesture"), stories told in words and image raise a number of questions that are now central for scholars of narrative: In a given graphic narrative (or a segment of one), how is the action parceled out between the image track and the verbal track, and how does this allocation of information bear on the process of building a narrative world? Put another way, how do readers use verbal-visual blueprints to construct storyworlds, and how do the worldmaking practices cued by graphic narratives relate to the practices prompted by other storytelling media? How might prior ac- counts of narrative phenomena (focalization, characterization, dialogue, consciousness representation, etc.) developed with reference to mono- modal or single-channel narratives need to be adjusted to accommodate graphic storytelling, with its interplay between semiotic channels? Further, do graphic narratives afford different storytelling possibilities than other kinds of multimodal narratives that exploit different semiotic channels, SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="4">6 Jared Gardner and David Herman such as the utterances and gestures used in face-to-face narration, or the moving images and sound track used in cinematic narratives? Comics studies has followed a very different trajectory from the one along which recent developments in narrative theory - in particular, its increasing engagement with graphic narratives - can be mapped out. Until quite recently, comics studies in the U.S. has been defined by a defensive relationship to the academy at large - the need to define and defend the object of study from negative assumptions about its cultural and aesthetic value. The result has been a field long dominated by formal and historical research - that is, by defining the object of study formally and defending its importance historically. Only in the last decade or so have U.S. scholars of graphic narrative begun to feel confident enough to move on to larger theoretical issues. (As suggested by studies like Groensteen's, mentioned above, the situation is somewhat different in European contexts, while in Japan yet another set of sociocultural and institutional practices has grown up around the Manga tradition, as discussed by Amy J. Elias in this issue.) One result of this longstanding defensive relationship has been a need for U.S. comics scholars to claim alliances with other, more recognizable fields: autobiography studies, sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, etc. The emerging academic canon of graphic narrative (Spiegelman's Maus, Satrapi's Persepolis, and, most recently, Bechdel's Fun Home) reflects the influence of these alliances - intellectual partnerships that have provided comics scholars access to academic journals that had never before consid- ered the form (see recent special issues or forums in Biography , MELUS, and Women's Studies Quarterly , for example). If these new alliances have opened the doors of the academy to con- versations about graphic narrative that are no longer limited to debating its formal definition and historical legacy, they have also made more ap- parent the limits of applying tools and methods developed for the study of prose narrative to the comics form. For this reason, we believe that of all the alliances forged with related fields in recent years, the most profitable for comics studies will be that with narrative theory, a field increasingly invested in foregrounding and theorizing the differences that medium- specificity (and multimodality) makes to storytelling. Further, as sug- gested above, and as Jared Gardner discusses in his contribution to this issue, we believe the intersection between comics studies and narrative theory is beneficial to both fields. On the one hand, it will enable comics studies to engage more fully with theoretical issues which, especially in the U.S. academy, have been largely neglected in favor of historical or cultural studies approaches. On the other hand, coming to terms with the stylistic specificities of graphic storytelling affords narrative theory a unique opportunity to confront the verbal bias of foundational work in the field - a bias that recent scholarship on narrative across media has only begun to overcome.

As the essays took shape, recurring questions emerged, and we have used these inductively derived rubrics to group the essays into four sections that reflect key lines of inquiry, and suggest directions for future research. In Part I, "Specificities of the Medium," the essays explore medium- specific features of graphic narratives and the differences those features make when it comes to using word-image sequences for storytelling purposes. Pascal Lefevre and Karin Kukkonen set out general theoreti- cal considerations that must be taken into account in any investigation of comics as a narrative medium, each focusing on different but related aspects of the form - multimodality, the unique ways in which comics figure temporal sequence, and the nature of graphic style. Jared Gardner then builds on these theoretical foundations, honing in on the question of the line, and discussing how coming to terms with the "handmadeness" of the lines drawn by comics creators - what he calls their "storylines" - might require a recalibration of fundamental concepts in narratology. Lefevre' s essay, "Some Medium-Specific Qualities of Graphic Se- quences," gives an account of some of the distinctive narrative affordances and constraints presented by the comics medium. Drawing on various genres of comics, from mainstream to experimental, Lefevre focuses on three medium-specific aspects of graphic narration: drawing styles, the temporal dimensions of individual panels, and the interpretation of se- quences of panels. Reconsidering the possibilities and limitations of the concepts "fabula," "plot" ("sjuzhet"), and "style" for the study of graphic narratives in particular, he analyzes how graphic styles imply a specific visual ontology and way of interpreting the storyworld; how individual panels can be designed to comprise not only a moment but also a longer temporal stretch, or even combine multiple distinct moments; and how, unlike viewers of frame sequences in cinema, comics readers can scan sequences at variable speeds and in more than one way, enabling them to develop competing as well as complementary interpretations. In "Com- ics as a Test Case for Transmedial Narratology," Karin Kukkonen uses Bill Willingham's and Mark Buckingham's ongoing comics series Fables to investigate the narrative-pertinent properties of comics viewed as a multimodal medium - one that combines the modes (or sets of semiotic resources) linked to words, images, and panel arrangements implying temporal sequence. Dovetailing her discussion of comics as a medium with an analysis of comics as a vehicle for narration, Kukkonen suggests how making sense of graphic storytelling requires attending to a dynamic SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="6">8 Jared Gardner and David Herman interplay of modes. She also discusses how graphic narratives can remedi- ate other narrative practices, as when Fables engages with the many texts, traditions, and storytelling styles associated with the Arabian Nights. In this way, Kukkonen highlights the importance of incorporating a histori- cal or diachronic dimension into the project of transmedial narratology, which up to now has mainly focused on structural or synchronic issues. Extending Lefevre's and Kukkonen' s analyses, Jared Gardner argues that discussions of medium-specific features of comics must be comple- mented by an emphasis on the material specificity of the line itself - the choice, for example, of a clear line style over elaborate cross-he tching, or of a Micron 005 pen over a 4H pencil. Gardner here highlights the one feature of comics that marks them as profoundly different from both novel and film: "the trace of the hand, the graphic enunciation that is the drawn line." Focusing on a variety of artists, including Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell (From Hell), Art Spiegelman (Maus), and others, Gardner calls for a study of the line as, in effect, the voiceprint of the comics cre- ator - as a fusion of "voice and writing, orality and print, performance and text" that slips between the explanatory grids developed up to now by theorists of narrative. Part II, "Varieties of Graphic Storytelling," includes Craig Fischer's and Charles Hatfield's co-authored essay on Eddie Campbell's autobio- graphical comics and Jan Baetens's essay on the interpretive and theoreti- cal challenges posed by the limit case of abstract comics. Taken together, these essays suggest something of the diversity of storytelling practices used in the medium - as well as the range of tools needed to characterize those practices. In "Teeth, Sticks, and Bricks: Calligraphy, Graphic Focalization, and Narrative Braiding in Eddie Campbell's Alec," Fischer and Hatfield focus on questions of serialization and its implications for graphic narra- tive theory, using Campbell's career-spanning autobiographical comics as their case study. In 2009, Campbell collected the vast majority of the individual Alec graphic novels and sketches into a single omnibus, Alec: The Years Have Pants . Through recurring ideas, images, and storytelling techniques, Campbell weaves thematic and narrative links not only inside the boundaries of individual works, but also across Pants as a whole. It is a task for graphic narrative theory to identify these sorts of connecting threads and explore how they constitute the warp and woof of works such as Campbell's. Fischer and Hatfield discuss line-styles as a connective tissue linking stories originally published in separate installments - in a way that bears comparison with Gardner's analysis of the material speci- ficity and narrative functions of the line. Further, Fischer's and Hatfield's concept of graphic focalization is meant to capture how Campbell uses SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="7">Graphic Narratives: Introduction 9 the resources of graphic storytelling to present both the events of his past and his later take on those events - in other words, to place in dialogue with one another the perspectives of the younger, experiencing self and the older, narrating self. Finally, Fischer and Hatfield draw on Groen- s teen's idea of braiding ( tressage ) to highlight the way recurrent themes and visual motifs in the Alec stories build cohesive ties across narrative installments; here their concern is with how these patterned elements create "a mosaic that embodies the way comics function as ... a lattice or system of networked images." Baetens' s essay on "Abstraction in Comics" focuses on a quite dif- ferent set of case studies, all deriving from an emergent area of graphic- narrative practice - the "abstract graphic novel." Baetens calls for a re- examination of fundamental concepts in narrative theory by expanding the corpus of stories it considers - in this case, by including not just graphic narratives, but also the abstract comics that reflexively interrogate the very possibility (or desirability) of telling stories in the comics medium. At issue are graphic novels which, in the manner of Martin Vaughn- James's The Cage (1973) and Olivier Deprez's Lenin Kino (2009), at first glance seem to lack recognizable representational or diegetic elements (characters, places, objects, events, etc.). Baetens uses texts of this sort to explore how the nonfigurative relates to the nonnarrative, and to develop a functional rather than a formal approach to abstract comics - that is, an approach focusing on the larger contexts in which images and sequences are embedded, rather than on the structure of the images and sequences themselves. He also uses instances of abstraction in comics to outline a model of anti-narrative as a form of resistance to dominant, narratively oriented interpretive norms. As he puts it: "Rather than being always an absolute antipode of narrative, antinarrative can 'hide' within the folds of narrative itself and suggest its own meanings that are intertwined with those promoted by acts of storytelling. As a kind of genre within the broader comics medium, abstract comics illustrate this mixing up of, or interlinking between, narrative and anti-narrative, at a very basic level." Part III suggests yet other lines along which graphic narrative theory might be explored and elaborated. Titled "Graphic Narratives, the Sciences of Mind, and the Scope of the Human," this section contains essays by Lisa Zunshine, Suzanne Keen, and David Herman that build on recent attempts to connect research on narrative with ideas being developed in the sciences of mind, including cognitive, social, and evolutionary psy- chology, the philosophy of mind, and other fields. All three of these essays seek to integrate the study of graphic storytelling with the ongoing project of investigating the nexus of narrative and mind, and in so doing they reflect the diversity of mind-oriented approaches to narrative, as well as SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="8">1 0 Jared Gardner and David Herman the range of ways in which those approaches link up with the enterprise of transmedial narratology. In addition, both Keen's and Herman's essays focus on graphic representations of non-human animals, with Herman's study also seeking to connect those representations (and their implica- tions for research on narrative and mind) with developments in the field of critical animal studies. In "What to Expect When You Pick up a Graphic Novel," Zunshine draws on research on the concept of theory of mind - the idea that humans have an evolved cognitive adaptation that makes them see behavior as caused by underlying mental states - to suggest that "graphic narratives build on theory-of-mind adaptations to offer their readers a pleasurable exercise in navigating complex social situations." After presenting a model of "sociocognitive complexity," or the embedding of mental states in other such states (as in Glen thinks that Sally knows how he feels about her), Zunshine explores how graphic narratives can deploy the resources of the medium to create greater or lesser degrees of complexity, more or less deeply layered mental-state attributions. She discusses several case studies, including Nancy Butler's 2009 adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice , which Zunshine characterizes as reducing the sociocognitive complexity of Austen's original text; Art Spiegelman's In the Shadow of No Towers (2004), with its "multiplied self-reflexive consciousness that fosters complex mental embedments"; and Alison Bechdel's Fun Home (2006), in which the older, narrating I attempts to come to terms with the younger, experiencing I's own efforts to negotiate her father's highly oblique modes of self-presentation. Zunshine also discusses how the covers of graphic narratives have evolved to feature cues that trigger genre expectations in readers. She argues that, with some important exceptions, "the volume of physical action and emotional intensity on the cover is inversely related to the level of sociocognitive complexity of the story." In "Fast Tracks to Narrative Empathy: Anthropomorphism and De- humanization in Graphic Narratives" and "Storyworld/Umwelt: Nonhu- man Experiences in Graphic Narratives," respectively, Keen and Herman develop other strategies for exploring the mind-narrative nexus via modes of graphic storytelling. Extending her previous work on narrative empathy by turning to stories combining words and images, Keen considers how this enrichment of her original corpus might raise new questions about the relationship between particular narrative techniques and particular kinds of empathetic response. More specifically, Keen's essay explores how, in comics and graphic novels, "illustrations of faces and bodily postures may capitalize on the availability of visual coding for human emotions, eliciting readers' feelings before they even read the accompanying text." To investigate this issue, Keen revisits her own concept of ambassadorial strategic empathy, or the attempt "to reach readers outside the boundaries SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="9">Graphic Narratives: Introduction 1 1 of the depicted social world in an effort to change attitudes and even solicit assistance in the real world/' in connection with two graphic case studies: J. P. Stassen's Deogratias: A Tale of Rwanda (2000; trans. 2006) and Brian K. Vaughan's and Niko Henrichon's Pride of Baghdad (2006). Keen considers how readers' reactions may be shaped by the use of anthropomorphized animal characters (or, in the case of Deogratias , by the use of a human character who takes on the attributes of a non-human animal) and also by the visual depiction of facial expressions and bodily postures. As Keen puts it, both of these graphic narratives "send empathetic representations out into the world on errands of humanitarian embassy" - with Stassen's portrayal of a human-to-dog transformation metonymically linked to the trauma of genocide in Rwanda, and Vaughan's and Henrichon's anthro- pomorphized lions similarly associated with the suffering and deaths of noncombatants in the 2003 Iraq war. As Keen also notes, however, there is as yet no "efficacy test" that might determine whether such techniques for immersing readers in fictional worlds indeed translate into "prosocial responding," or taking action to ameliorate negative circumstances of the sort portrayed in these two narratives. For his part, David Herman sets out a broader taxonomy of the range of ways graphic narratives depict the experiences of nonhuman animals, using Nick Abadzis's Laika (2007), installments of Animal Man comics (1965-), Grant Morrison's and Frank Quitely's We3 (2005), and other narratives. Drawing on the study of storytelling practices across media as well as post-Cartesian models of mind, Herman positions his case studies along a continuum that stretches from animal allegory and anthropomorphic projection, at one end, to texts that use words and im- ages in a bid to capture the distinctive texture and ecology of nonhuman experiences, at the other end. He thereby suggests how mind-oriented scholarship on narrative across media can be informed by and contribute to the emergent field of critical animal studies. Scholars in this field ques- tion assumptions about the primacy of the human, and call for a rethinking of practices based on such assumptions. Narrative theory in general and graphic narrative theory in particular can contribute to this same far- reaching project by exploring how stories figure the lived, phenomenal worlds - what the German-Estonian philosopher-biologist Jakob von Uexkull termed the Umwelten - of creatures whose organismic structure differs from our own. By examining how word-image sequences model the richness and complexity of "what it is like" for nonhuman others, graphic narrative theorists can provide a scaffolding for critical animal studies, underscoring what is at stake in the trivialization - or outright destruction - of nonhuman experiences.

In "The Narrativity of Post-Convergent Media: No Ghost Just a Shell and Rirkrit Tiravanija's '(ghost reader C.H.)/" Amy J. Elias connects graphic narratives with contemporary artistic practices across media, and the theoretical frameworks used to analyze those practices. She engages with an art project called "No Ghost Just a Shell/' a collaborative group of works commissioned in 1999-2002 by French artists Pierre Huyghe and Philippe Parreno, which includes the piece by Tiravanija on which Elias focuses. The project centers on a manga character for whom Huyghe and Parreno purchased the copyright, and transformed into a 3-D model named Annlee. Tiravanija's "(ghost reader C.H.)," presents a visual 3-D Annlee as a reader, book in hand, and invites the museum-goer to don a pair of headphones to listen as Annlee reads Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Elias uses Tiravanija's work as a vehicle for interrogating the structure of Huyghe's and Par- reno's larger project, whose narrativity derives from its key manga refer- ent (Masamune Shirow's 1988-1997 The Ghost in the Shell) and from the origin story about Annlee's creation and liberation. Deploying a variety of tools from narrative theory, Elias also outlines strategies for situating contemporary graphic narratives in their borader media ecology. Spe- cifically, she uses her case study to explore the role of graphic and other modes of storytelling in an environment of "post-convergent media"; in this environment, brought on by a particular moment of technological development, different media converge to the same end and - as in video games - create work that is only possible in the new, syncretic medium. In compiling this special issue, our aim has been twofold: drawing attention to the great variety and imaginative power of graphic narrative practices, and underscoring the need to develop tools for graphic narrative theory that are correspondingly nuanced and generative. We hope that future scholars working at the intesection of comics studies and narrative theory can extend these lines of inquiry - and in the process sketch out new forms of inquiry into the line.

It is a major historical irony that one of the foundational documents for structuralist nar- ratology was Vladimir Propp's investigation of folktales rooted in oral traditions.
