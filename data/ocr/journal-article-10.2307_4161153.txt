<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wilson Bull., 90 (4), 1978, pp. 665-666 THE ADVENTURE OF BIRDS. By CharIton Ogburn, illus. by Matthew Kalmenoff. William Morrow and Company, Inc., New York, 1976: 381 pp. $10.95.-Charlton Ogburn con- fesses that he has always had great admiration for the "qualities" of the kingbird. He finds that it "shows itself without restraint," has energy that "brims over," and inevitably favors a perch "from which it can command the scene" (p. 142). Ogburn indulges in considerable speculation about similarities between avian and human behavior; perhaps it is fitting, then, that his book displays the traits he imputes to one of his favorite birds. The Adventure of Birds exhibits an unrestrained and effusive prose style that often relies upon (self-acknowledged) cliches; it conveys the author's boundless enthusiasm for his panoramic subject: birds in general. This is a hybrid work, that tries to provide general information about birds, and in addition describes a personal philosophy about the pleasures of watching them. Ogburn is least successful in the first half of the book, "A World of Birds," where he tries to combine his eclectic, digressive tone with a textbook exposition on basic features of avian physiology and behavior; he devotes much of this space to summarizing and quoting at length from a small core of standard references, for example Welty's The Life of Birds. The information provided might be useful for a novice unaware of other sources. Because the organization of Ogburn's book is idiosyncratic, many of the textual divisions seem intrusive; the headings read too much like predictable choices for head- ings in a book that has been written many times before: "The Domain of Birds," "The Divisions of the Avian Treasure," "Birds of Our Cultural Homeland," etc. The second half of the book, "Birds Through the Year" is more successful, probably because Og- burn is not trying to describe what a bird is, and concentrates on transmitting to the reader the experience of birding, or simply being aware of birds through the different seasons. It is difficult not to appreciate the intensity of the author's absorption, espe- cially if the reader shares it, even remotely. Clearly, it is not fair to criticize Oghurn for not writing a more "ornithological" work; he admits at the start that he is an "ornithophile" and can well imagine what the reaction of an ornithologist might be to his lavishly subjective approach, and the baffling title of his book. Its appeal may be limited to those who enjoy energetic paeans to nature, and a great many asides of a personal character. But instead of simply classifying Ogburn's book as part of a genre aimed at a specific audience, it may be instructive to examine it more critically as a specimen of "nature-writing." Even consciously admitted indulgence has its dangers. Discussions of evolutionary processes are couched in anthropomorphic terms, for example, "Nature discovered"</page><page sequence="2">666 THE WILSON BULLETIN * Vol. 90, No. 4, December 1978 and "Nature picked." This phraseology is used by an author who "knows better," but it is unfortunate that it is so common in books such as these, that try to be in- formative as well as personal, and are most likely to be read by the general public. The facile psychologizing often "permitted" in such writing leads to embarrassing and awkward analogies: "A Catbird from whose pillaged nest I once yanked a Black Snake broke into hurried song, as a Japanese, in a situation of tragedy, expressions of suffering blocked by a syndrome, may smile" (p. 101). Ogburn asserts that the creativity of humans and birds alike is "spurred by the exhilarations that spring from asserting one's being against the odds . . ." (p. 127). He speculates about the differences in "drive" between various types of birds, and goes on to tell us, "it does seem that some human stocks, or social groups, and individuals do better than others at meeting new and challenging situations and are more aggressive" (p. 141). In speaking of bird territoriality, Ogburn provides us with an insight into his own political view of nature. A bird defending its territory is a "communicant of the Universal" and "dispatches the enemies of the rightful order-he, the warrior, the elect," who is "possessed by the spirit" (p. 147). Citing sociobiological theory, Ogburn remarks that a human's territorial impulse "would appear to be in his blood, and I cannot see that it has been much diluted, if any" (p. 151). There are even more facile ruminations: "It may be that the great apes, second only to man in intelligence, have made so little of their oppor- tunities on earth, because like some human tribes and many, if not most, human indi- viduals, they lack the need for exotic fulfillments" (p. 188). What is Ogburn's ultimate message? In a bird's cry, he finds something that is elusive: "If it is not in the bird itself, a rendering-largely unconscious, admittedly- of what is in the very plasma of life, derived from who knows where, then, to me, it is a quality of the cosmos of which the bird is the-again, largely unconscious-agency of expression" (p. 368). Like many nature-writers, he harbors the almost religious hope that there will always be more to the natural world than we can comprehend. By trying to be panoramically informative and anecdotal at the same time, Ogburn has exhibited some of the pitfalls of the genre he has chosen. Perhaps there is a slimmer volume hidden within this one, that, being more modest in scope, would have been more successful.-KATHLEEN E. DUFFIN.</page></plain_text>
