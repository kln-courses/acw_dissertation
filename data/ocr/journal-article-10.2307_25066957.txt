<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology and the Religions of Canaan and Israel, by Beth Alpert Nakhai. ASOR Books, Vol ume 7. Boston: American Schools of Oriental Research, 2001. xii + 262 pp., 4 figures. Paper. $29.95. [Distributed in North America by The David Brown Book Company] This volume is a revised version of the author's disser tation, which she completed in 1993 under William Dever's direction at the University of Arizona. It seeks to champion the archaeological record as "a strong and independent witness to the religious practices of Canaanites and Is raelites" (p. 2) from the Middle Bronze to the Iron Age. Nakhai argues that scholars of religion must treat archae ological and textual witnesses as discursive complements to each other. Toward this end, she surveys evidence from sites designated as religious or cultic in nature as well as biblical and Ugaritic descriptions of religious practice. Na khai begins by reviewing the scholarship concerned with the value of archaeological data to the study of religion in the southern Levant. She then proceeds to survey social scientific literature on the study of religion, but the chapter mainly concerns perspectives on the rite of sacrifice, which Nakhai regards as fundamental to religions of ancient Ca naan and Israel. Nakhai performs yeoman's work in the assembly of numerous archaeological data on sanctuaries spanning the Middle Bronze to Iron Ages. The result is a readable, care ful omnibus of spatial characteristics and artifactual curi osities of structures commonly identified as "religious" or "ritual" in function. Here is a handy reference tool that supplies access to salient features of import and relevant bibliography for meatier investigation of editio princeps particulars. This quick and easy access to a massive body of archaeological data represents the main contribution of the book to scholarship. The author states that this work intends to showcase the value of the archaeological record as an independent wit ness to religious practice. On this count, the core of the book succeeds, though for different reasons than the reader may assume from a cursory glance at the introductory chapters and the conclusion. Nakhai turns to social-scien tific literature as an ostensible means to fashion a more circumspect synthesis of the theoretical and ethnographic literature on religious practice. The aim here is commend able, but unfortunately the results fall short. Nakhai seizes on sacrifice as the defining characteristic of religion among the studied cultures, but she does not integrate this theo retical supposition into the analysis of material culture. The core database of the book, then, is circumscribed by a cursory review of dated theoretical literature, which finds no purchase in the ensuing data, and a conclusion, which offers no synthesis of the foregoing theory and data. It appears that the author has identified sacrifice as "the pri mary religious rite" (p. 201) because it is possibly the most salient element of ritual practice that the assembled archae ological minutiae might inform. The overall effect is a thesis emerging as afterthought to connect disparate data under an overarching theme. This is pardonable on some level, as any objective analysis of databases must observe empirical patterns rather than superimposing a priori ex planations. In this case, however, there is no attempt to elu cidate the particulars of practice through the integration of theory, analogy, and artifact. This is less pardonable, how ever, because that dialogue is the book's stated method ological objective (p. 16). The phenomenological isolation of sacrifice as the quint essential experience of religious observance is a strange choice, an etic choice. Nakhai's pro forma social-scientific citations suggest a universalist approach to the rite as an umbrella for tangible and intangible experiences alike. Yet we know that not all sacrifices are equal. They are not interchangeable cross-culturally; they are seldom inter changeable interpersonally or intracommunally. There may indeed exist parallels between the physical mechanics of ritual in different cultures, but that does not demonstrate similitude of meaning, function, or cultural valuation. Cul tural ideologies and epistemologies may differ radically, notwithstanding the apprehension of casual or superficial resemblance of ritual enactment. Even affording Nakhai the monolith for the sake of argument, the supporting theoret ical and ethnographic literature is both selective and anti quated?and the results for her grander phenomenological claims are fatal. There are numerous reductionist, if not simplistic, appeals to sacrificial ritual as the mechanism for</page><page sequence="2">2006 BOOK REVIEWS 117 communal identification and divine communion (both de batable), but there is no contemplation of pivotal studies by Bell (1995; 1997) and Smith (1987) on ritual or Bourdieu (1977) on practice. Specialists have devoted countless volumes to exploring the cultural location and intellectual dimensions of sacrifice as archetypes, particularisms, phe nomena, and epiphenomena. Likewise unconsulted go sine qua non works by Bloch (1992), Hamerton-Kelly (1987), Girard (1977; 1987), Jay (1992), Read (1998), and Carrasco (1999). Even an overtly structuralist recourse (de Heusch 1985) would have produced a coherent thesis for constructive debate. The import of these omissions seems moot, however, in the anticlimax. Nakhai's choice to allow the archaeological record to remain silent on sac rifice seems to eschew any real interpretive relationship between the anthropological literature and the material cul ture. Since the book elects not to clarify how theory and practice intertwine within the spatial domain of the archi tectural remains, it avoids the opportunity to construct a vo cabulary and discursive framework for describing ritual context, sacrality, and propitiation. One pines for what might have been had Nakhai paired her erudite familiarity with Israel's archaeological remains with Lindsay Jones's (2000) magisterial work on homology and hermeneutics of sacred space. Despite the aim to accentuate the interpretive value of archaeology as a witness to practice, Nakhai ultimately re treats to the textual record to salvage evidence of meaning. The dependence on the biblical material for synthetic fodder is disappointing, as is the mysterious choice, in a volume ostensibly devoted to sacrifice, to mention the vis ceral, incendiary rite of child sacrifice only a single time; and there is no mention of Punic inscriptions that in form the human *mulk offerings (Cross 2003: 231-37) fre quently misunderstood as a Molek cult in the Hebrew Bible. Her claim of communal centrality for sacrifice, then, coexists uncomfortably with an indifference to the human istic ramifications of a community that preys on itself. On this count, Nakhai missed an occasion to conduct some meaningful cross-cultural work with the benefit of a vast inventory of research on human sacrifice. This omission is not entirely Nakhai's fault, however. Her scholarship is a product of a dispassionate scholarly culture that generally avoids scrutiny of child sacrifice in the same apologetic manner in which it once blanched at the prospects of Is raelite polytheism. Nakhai places great stress on Ugarit, but the discussion of sacrificial ritual is limited mainly to a brief recitation of rites from the epigraphic corpus. This book appeared too late to make use of the recent synthe ses of Clemens (2001) and Pardee (2002), but the neglect of Pardee's (2000) magnum opus on the ritual texts is unfortunate. On the whole, the textual discussion of sacrifice is confusing. Nakhai admits that sacrifice parallels the offer ing of produce, textiles, ores, jewelry, and other goods to the deity. On the other hand, she somehow fails to recog nize animal (or child) sacrifice as a constituent element of a ritual theology that provisions anthropomorphic deities within a rubric of divine consumption. In other words, ani mal sacrifice is a component of a larger theophanic con ceptualization in which the gods ingest and sport material things. Exegetical vagaries of Genesis 4 aside, any attempt to prescind one kind of offering from another only mangles the gesture's rationale. And gestures, as theorists remind us, are the surgical instruments of staged ritual. In Atraha sis, starving humans shame Adad with a loaf of bread of fered during a famine for which he was responsible. Was this rite of sacrifice the most important phenomenological encounter with divinity for the average penitent? Probably not, but it made for great theater.
