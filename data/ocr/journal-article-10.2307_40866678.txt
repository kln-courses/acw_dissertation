<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Affair of Anna N. Schmidt and Vladimir Solov'ev SAMUEL D. CIORAN One of those bizarre mysteries in Vladimir Solov'ev's personal life that profoundly influenced the lives of symbolists like Andrey Belyi and Aleksandr Blok was the curious relationship between that philo- sopher-poet and Anna Nikolaevna Schmidt. It is unlikely that the details of their fascinating encounter will ever be elucidated fully, so obscured and distorted are they by lack of information and by rumour. Solov'ev's "mystical romance" with Anna Schmidt occupies a unique position with respect to his "earthly loves," for Anna Schmidt considered herself something in the nature of the earthly incarnation of his divine Sophia. Their relationship is interesting not only in the light of Solov'ev's poetry and philosophy, but well worth examining insofar as it seems to pro- vide a seminal pattern which was to be repeated and mimicked elsewhere during the symbolist period in Russian literature. Solov'ev's ardent ambition was to transform all of existing Christen- dom and to unite the Eastern and Western Churches by means of an ultra-rationalistic and theoretical exegesis of the genuine truth contained in Christianity.1 He felt that although people were acquainted with Christian ethics and tradition, they had no concept of its grand design. Its purpose had dwelt in obscurity, the hegemony of mystics who pos- sessed an intuitive, irrational knowledge of God's plan. The Russian philosopher saw his duty, therefore, as the unfolding of this mystical obscurity. His attempts involved the revelation and articulation of the concept of Sophia, the Divine Wisdom of God, whose numerous hypo- stases came to signify the process of syzygy or the union of opposites leading to total-unity or all-in-oneness. While Sophia's function was invariably accepted by Solov'ev as a rational necessity in the operation of the scheme of Godmanhood or the Universal Church, nevertheless the plurality of her nomenclature and manifestations just as invariably ] In 1873 at the age of nineteen, Vladimir Solov'ev outlined an entire manifesto for his future philosophy and personal involvement.

From his theoretical and poetic works it is clear that Solov'ev's visions of Sophia were both rational and irrational. His philosophical exegesis of her aspects drew inspiration from the well of his mystical experience as recorded in his poem "Three Encounters," just as his inspired poetry was nourished by the theoretical system outlined in Lectures on Godmanhood, La Russie et l'Église Universelle and "The Meaning of Love." Solov'ev's concepts of Godmanhood, Theocracy, and the Universal Church can be construed simply as Sophiology for, in fact, the concept of Sophia as the Divine Wisdom of God represents the essential nature of his entire thought.2 A wealth of aliases designates Sophia and often obscures her paramount function throughout the system. At one moment she appears to be an indivisible yet recognizable aspect of the Holy Trinity and, at the next, a divine and separate agent. This formulation of Sophia explaining the special nature and relationship of the Holy Trinity proved very troublesome for the twentieth-century émigré Russian Orthodox Church. The interpretations of theologians like Sergei Bulgakov and Pavel Florenskii seemed to present her as an apparent fourth hypostasis, threatening the traditional Orthodox dogma of the Trinity.'* Solov'ev explains the three hypostases of the Holy Trinity, indivisible in a single God, in a more or less traditional manner. But he introduces a new theological concept in order to define the unique substance of the Trinity, the relationship between its elements. This divine principle - Solov'ev's Sophiology, if not directly inspired by Gnostic teachings on the "Sophia-Mythus," certainly parallels the major Gnostic beliefs, in particular the Valentinian system. 1 The course of debate which split the émigré Russian Orthodox Church in the 1920's and 1930's into two factions which polarized around Archbishop Serafim of Karlovcy (the anti-Sophia faction) and Father Sergei Bulgakov of the Paris Seminary (the pro-Sophia faction) may be traced in all of its complexity through the pages of the journals, Orientalia Christiana Periódica (Rome), Russie et Chrétienté (Paris), and Put' (Paris) throughout the 1930's. The bibliography contained at the conclusion of Bulgakov's summary on the Sophio- logical teaching, The Wisdom of God. A Brief Summary of Sophiology (London, 1937), also offers a well-documented guide to the literature of both factions in this dispute. Mention should also be made of an extremely impor- tant work which appeared earlier in Russia, namely, Pavel Florenskii, Stolp i utverzhdenie istiny (St. Petersburg, 1917). See in particular, "Pis'mo desyatoe: Sofiya," pp. 319-92.</page><page sequence="3">Α. Ν. SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 41 of "all-in-oneness" receives the name "Sophia."4 Drawing on the canon- ical text of Proverbs and the apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon, Solov'ev argues that when God created the world, the Idea He possessed in His Wisdom was that of Sophia.5 God wills chaos or the material world to exist in order that it might be returned of its own free will to oneness with God, with the divine cosmos. Sophia's function is to represent the ultimate design for the union of Heaven and Earth. Furthermore, God desires that there exist outside of Himself another being who might become divine or be one with Him. Now Sophia's terrestrial counterpart is the World Soul who has the potential to become divine, who can strive to unite herself with the divine or in Solov'evian terms, to embrace the Logos, accepting the divine principle of oneness. As the mater matéria, synonymous with "Mother Nature," she provides man with his body and the terrestrial realm with its physical forms. Like her, man has the potential to transcend himself, to approach Godman- hood by seeking union with the divine. However, if he turns away from the spiritual, if he seeks merely to exert his will over nature and exalt himself over God, then he is in danger of becoming the Mangod, the bridegroom of the daughter of chaos and plurality rather than of cosmos and divine unity. The theologian in Solov'ev conceived of man's eventual union with God, of his achievement of Godmanhood, in a series of triads wherein the process of uniting apparent opposites would result in divine syzygies which would create the transformative synthesis required for Godman- hood. At the lowest human physical level the triad which he outlines is that of man plus woman equals society. Therefore, the first collective mankind or society is the result of the syzygal union of man and woman. At the highest human level, however, man and woman unite in the next triad to create the perfect society or perfect humanity which is ready for union with God, thereby reflecting the basic Christian truth that all history is the striving of mankind to be reunited with God in Godman- hood. The divine archetype of this transformative syzygy which mankind has before its eyes, is that of Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin Mary. (In Solov'ev's exegesis, the Holy Virgin maintains an ambiguous role as both the mother and bride of Christ.) Out of their divine union the 4 See V. S.

Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary signify the recognizable dual and simul- taneously indivisible natures of the divine and extra-divine that Solov'ev sought in the synthesis of Godmanhood and which he believed existed in embryonic form in man. The names "Christ" and "Holy Virgin" represent the divine aspect of the syzygy, while "Jesus" and "Mary" represent the extra-divine. However, it is Sophia as the passive symbol of God's Divine Wisdom, as the reflection of the divine all-in-oneness of the Holy Trinity, as God's plan for Godmanhood or the total-unity of the divine and extra-divine, that invariably presides over each stage in the ascending series of syzygal triads. The force which impels each triad towards union is love. Solov'ev's "The Meaning of Love" makes clear that the image of divine love is once again the symbol of the Divine Feminine, Sophia, Mediatrix between Heaven and Earth. Inform- ing her hypostasis as the Divine or Eternal Feminine is the desire for union, for she now represents that perfect syzygy, a harmony of union which has been achieved.6 Consequently, Solov'ev viewed "love" not as the means of furthering the species, but rather as the symbolic union of opposites. The submergence of the individual ego in a free and progressive syzygy with another individual provided the first step towards the ultimate marriage of the perfect humanity with the Church of Christ and, subsequently, of all mankind with God in Godmanhood. While this brief outline in no way does justice to Solovev's Sophiology, it should help to clarify the role of "syzygy," or the union of opposites, in the achievement of his vision. It should also underline the over- riding force of Sophia's projection throughout the entire schema as the arch-symbol of syzygy. Although Solov'ev does not invest her with the status of a fourth hypostasis and thereby upset the traditional triune pantheon, she is most often invoked to describe the ultimate goal of 6 It is curious that while Solov'ev's system is essentially that of Valentinian Gnosticism, he provides no place in his outline of Sophiology for the process of redemption which would elucidate the archetypal role of Sophia much more clearly. Sophia's "fall" in the gnostic system is caused by her desire, in the imitation of God, to create another being outside of a syzygal union. But her offspring is an "abortion" without shape or form which becomes, in some accounts at least, the terrestrial realm or chaos. She is restored or redeemed eventually by Christ or the so-called "Joint Fruit of the Pleroma" who goes to her in her longing to be reunited with the Pleroma. Redeemed by her union with Christ or the "Joint Fruit," she is set to reign over the Heavenly Jerusalem which represents the exemplary union of Heaven and Earth.</page><page sequence="5">Α. Ν. SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 43 total-unity through syzygy. While perhaps held in check in Solov'ev's rational formulation of Sophiology, Sophia emerges unique and triumph- ant in the intuitive formulation of his poetry. She is not only his muse, but the anima-projection of his own longing for syzygy. It is with the undeniably feminine spirit of Sophia that Solov'ev holds communion, and not with God or Christ. And so it was for Aleksandr Blok who wrote that, although he recognized the efficacy of Christ and esteemed what He stood for, it was nonetheless to his Beautiful Lady that he in- stinctively turned.7 While none were apt to impugn Solov'ev's morals because of his rationale for Sophiology outlined in Lectures on God- manhood, La Russie et l'Église Universelle and "The Meaning of Love," the personalized invocation of his lyrics addressed to Sophia was given an erotic interpretation by critics who were unable to distinguish between verses addressed to Sophia, the World Soul, and his "earthly loves." In any event, the inter-penetration of eroticism and religion in the philo- sophical and poetic work of Solov'ev provides a basis for understanding what happened in his "affair" with Anna Nikolaevna Schmidt, an "affair" which confounded his disciples with a bewildering actualization of theory, and armed his opponents with a religious scandal.8 Anna Nikolaevna Schmidt (1851-1905) lived in Nizhnii Novgorod where she held various positions including that of domestic tutor as well as correspondent for several newspapers.9 She was unmarried and lived a solitary life with her mother whose illnesses demanded constant attention. Her financial resources being extremely limited, she found life difficult and rather burdensome. Among her acquaintances and colleagues she enjoyed the reputation of being hardworking and kind- hearted, if somewhat eccentric. She came to know Solov'ev and his work 7 Blok-Belomu, 18 iiunya/1 iiulya 1903; Aleksandr Blok i Andrei Belyi. Fere- piska (Moscow, 1940), p. 36. * See in particular N. Valentinov, Two Years with the Symbolists (Stanford, California, 1969). Valentinov's book is aimed at showing the abberrations and excesses of a number of the symbolists. Particularly Belyi, Blok and Solov'ev come under heavy fire for their mystical eroticism. (Despite the English title, the book is in Russian.) 0 Anna Schmidt's collected works are assembled in A. N.

Of special importance is the study of Anna Schmidt and Vladimir Solov'ev compiled by Sergei Bulgakov which takes account of the writings of both Schmidt and Solov'ev, although he tends to romanticize and over-dramatize their "misticheskii roman."

Attracted to his philosophical-poetic ideas and believing that his visions and revelations were essentially iden- tical with her own, she became convinced that there was some pre- ordained and divine covenant to be fulfilled between them. Before examining their personal relationship, perhaps it is best to outline and analyse Schmidt's own curious if somewhat obscure, Sophio- logy in which she herself apparently plays the major role. This strange material is to be found in the chapter entitled uOn the Present-Day Life of Margarita" in the single volume of her posthumously published manuscripts.10 "Margarita" is the spiritual appellation adopted by Anna Schmidt.11 God sent her twice to be reborn on earth, but her first incar- nation is corporeal, whereas her second is spiritual. During the first, she was to have no conscious knowledge of her origins or purpose; only during the second would she be omniscient and aware of her spiritual nature. Her role in the first life is defined thus: "In her first life she knew herself only through the personal teaching of Jesus and lived on earth mainly in order that the human race might be born anew through her. . . ,"12 If this parallels Solov'ev's concept of the uncomprehending physical nature of the World Soul, then the spiritual nature of Margarita in her second life also appears to echo the spiritualization of the world- soul who has consciously received the Logos or divine principle: " ... in her second life she was now beholden, by means of invisible inspirations, to recognize her spirit and all the as yet undisclosed secrets of the heavens in order to reveal them to herself and to her children, but to remain personally unknown to them."1·"5 10 I z rukopisei Anny Nikolaevny Shtnidt. In view of the fact that this book is extremely difficult to obtain, I have chosen to quote liberally from it in order to give some idea of its contents which, if not exactly enlightening to the gen- eral reader, should offer at least some idea of the bewildering blend of reli- gion, mysticism and personal revelation that typifies Anna Schmidt's Final Testament. 11 Anna bchmidt s cnoice or Margarita as ner spiritual name is oi some interest. It signifies the "pearl" (See Matthew, 13:46; Revelation, 21:21) associated with the value of heaven and the twelve gates leading into Heaven with Christ's Second Coming. In the Greek Church it also denotes the vessel wherein the host is kept. Perhaps more significant is the fact that "Margarit" represents a collection of Byzantine sermons (slova) by Ioann Zlatoust and their transla- tion into Old Russian. These homilies no doubt represent the "pearls of wisdom" inherent in Margarita's spiritual revelation. V2 lz rukopisei, p. 163. The similarity between this description and Solovev's own theoretical outline of the unconscious feminine and passive principle of the world soul is quite remarkable.

SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 45 Apparently the preparations for her second and spiritual life on earth begin in 1848, the year of the "climax of lawlessness and degradation" or, in other words, the manifestation and appearance of the Antichrist. In her second birth she receives her corporeality from her parents, but her spirit and soul arise directly "from whence she abided in Jesus Christ as in her first life."14 The peculiar nature of this second birth is described by Schmidt in the following manner: . . . only then as a babe was she differentiated from Him who as an infant was born outside of a mother, but now as a babe she was differentiated out of Him who was an infant also, but who is abiding together with her within His Mother, His eternal focus was in Her, and she was differentiated from Him at the birth of what was only his human but not yet His eternal spirit. . . . Ac- cording to this origin, she, as in the first life, exclusively in dis- tinction to other people, was born without any conception of sin within herself.1"' Although this passage is certainly confusing, its main idea is reminiscent of Solov'ev's Sophiology. In qualifying her second and spiritual life, she visualizes an original oneness of herself with or within Christ. Her differentiation, her heterogeneous nature is expressed not in its spiritual oneness, but only at physical birth, in a material context.10 Already one can foresee a possible movement towards syzygy, towards androgy- nous union. She appears to be the feminine counterpart, purified and spiritual, to the masculine Christ, while both in their oneness are the offspring of some celestial Mother, the birth-giving principle of Divinity. In relation to Christ, Margarita appears to occupy simultaneously all the possible feminine roles - mother, daughter, sister, bride and wife. Nevertheless, her foremost and undeniably explicit role is that of wife or bride: She felt with all her heart that she occupied alongside Him the same exclusive place as His Mother, and that even in a different manner she loved Him more than His Own Mother, although in other things His Mother loved Him more, but that all the same it was only with her and with no one else that she was able to stand 11 Ibid. 1Γι Ibid., pp. 163-64. 10 Compare with both Solov'ev and the Gnostic system. One will recall also the theory of androgeny expounded by Aristophanes in Plato's Symposium.</page><page sequence="8">46 CANADIAN SLAVONIC PAPERS as an equal in closeness and devotion to Her Son. This was the beginning of the awareness that she was taken directly from Him, out of the soul of His Spirit. This alone was expected of her by the Father and no sooner had she come to this very feeling and, like Mary, having come to love Christ with the love of a Mother without having seen Him, she loved Him with the love of a wife without having seen Him, and herself not comprehending her own love, He sent to be incar- nated in her her eternal spirit.17 Although Schmidt was not supposed to have had any knowledge of cabbalistic or gnostic literature, according to Sergei Bulgakov,18 the relationship of Christ and Margarita bears an astonishing similarity to Valentinian gnosticism and, of course, to Solov'ev's own concept of divine syzygy. Whether or not this notion of Christ and Margarita as bridegroom and bride, and of Christ's restoration to harmony of the fallen and despairing Sophia-Margarita was genuine revelation or gleaned at first or second-hand from either gnostic sources or Solov'ev is, of course, a matter of speculation. However, most people acquainted with Schmidt were quite convinced that it was pure - or rather, pre- ordained - coincidence. After undergoing a voluntary six-day trial and recording her testa- ment, Margarita gained full knowledge of her heavenly family, and now she waited for God to recognize that she had fulfilled the tasks for which she had been sent on earth and to take her up to heaven. Once again the longing for union is expressed in the anthropomorphic terms of syzygy which were characteristic of Solov'ev and the Gnostics: All that a mother, wife and daughter experiences in unending separation from her children, husband, father and mother, she felt on earth and did not know how to bide her time until it was granted to her to press to her heart her children, the eternal, angelic babes, and her Beloved, and fall at the feet of her heav- enly Father and her true Mother-Sister. . . . Her longing for Him i.e. Christ and her longing to be with Him was immeasurably greater than all that could retain her on earth.19 17 I z rukopisei, p. 166. 18 Bulgakov makes this claim in Tikhie dumy, pp. 74-114. 1!) I z rukopisei, p. 168.</page><page sequence="9">Α. Ν. SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 47 The revelation and profession of the testament of which she is the earthly agent is no less than the spirit of her son by Jesus Christ whom she calls the Neo-Israelite Church. She is to provide both the spiritual and material substance of her son by Christ, and the process of this syzygy is quite overt: The acceptance and profession by her of the testament which today is delivered through her must give rise within her to the life of her future son and grant within her the fruition of his spirit, for all that is recorded by her today, is his spirit, and all this must be affirmed by the profession of faith and acts of the Neo- Israelite Church in order that her son might come to fruition within her. At the same time with this preparation of his spirit for his birth, she has conceived his body as well; she has conceived it in the heavens in her incorruptible body as soon as on earth her eternal spirit became settled in her; for from this time began her physical union with Christ under one form, with their blood flow- ing simultaneously from one to the other of their hearts which had become one.20 This "son" which is born of Margarita and Christ is, in its physical aspect on earth, the Church, or more specifically the "Neo-Israelite Church" as Schmidt calls it. This, of course, parallels Solov'ev's doc- trine of the "Universal Church" or "Godmanhood" produced in its divinely symbolic form by the exemplary union of Christ and the Holy Virgin. The distinction between the physical aspect (i.e. Jesus and Mary) and the spiritual (i.e. Christ and Holy Virgin) is reached, we are led to believe, independently by both Solov'ev and Schmidt. This physico-spiritual conception of the "Son-Church" underlies the two "mighty purposes" of Schmidt's Final Testament, concerned as it is with Armageddon: The foundation of the Neo-Israelite Church on earth outside of Margarita and the conception of the body of her son in heaven within her, these are the two mighty purposes of the Final Testa- ment. They both lead to one and the same end desired of God; to the destruction of the despoiled world. For the time has come for which the son of Jesus Christ and Margarita has been born, about whom the Apocalypse prophe- sies, and who he shall be: he shall be the destroyer of the world, Λ Ibid., pp. 169-70.</page><page sequence="10">48 REVUE CANADIENNE DES SLAVISTES he has been born for the purpose of destroying all the works of the enemy of his Father.21 The time is near for the birth of this Son-Church, for the world is shaken at its foundations. Just as the Gnostics and Solov'ev intentionally blur the distinctions between the various hypostases in order to reflect more nearly the one- ness of the divine spirit and the many-sidedness of Sophia, so we find in Schmidt's account a similar multiplicity of roles for the holy figures and, in particular, for Margarita. Clearly her progress from physical to spiritual incarnation culminates in a divine syzygy with Christ and in the birth of the Son-Church which prepares the way for the final confrontation of good and evil. The destruction of the latter and the triumphant union of heaven and earth, offer an uncanny parallel to the course of universal history which Solov'ev outlined in Three Con- versations (1900) and "A Short Tale of the Antichrist." Moreover, Anna Schmidt's theme of destructive apocalypse, allied with a Sophio- logical view of world history, must have struck a particularly responsive note in Solov'ev, since during the final months of his life his own vision was becoming increasingly apocalyptic. Whereas Solov'ev's final con- clusions on eschatology may have been fostered by the growth of pessi- mism about the positive course of universal history and a sense of impo- tence in the face of the divisions between the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity, Anna Schmidt's own vision was permeated with apocalypse from the very beginning. Furthermore, the bride-mother role of Margarita as the necessary vehicle for the culmination of his- tory is much more overt. Although the successive stages of theosophical "marriage" and the resultant offspring of these syzygies are femininely inspired in both Schmidt and Solov'ev, Schmidt's projection of herself as the earthly incarnation of Christ's Bride and the Mother of their Son - the Neo-Israelite Church - obviously goes far beyond any claims that Solov'ev ever made for himself whether in his philosophy or his poetry. The manner in which Schmidt visualized the culmination of her role on earth as Margarita is arresting, especially when viewed in connection with certain requests made to Sergei Bulgakov concerning her corres- 21 Ibid., p. 170.</page><page sequence="11">Α. Ν. SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 49 pondence with Solov'ev. The final summation of the life of Margarita is described by Schmidt in the following way: Just as the world was not created by itself, but by God, so also will it be destroyed not by itself but by the Son of God, Raphael. (And the first time the mother-Church lived on earth in order to give birth anew to all her children, but the second time, - in order to bear the destroyer of the world that her children might taste of the fruits of redemption.) Whether Margarita, incarnated for the second time, has died or not - is unknown, just as she herself is unknown.22 From all accounts, Schmidt discovered Raphael, or the earthly incarna- tion of Christ, in Solov'ev and made her views known to him by a letter in which she asked to meet him personally. One can well imagine the speculation set off by Schmidt's overture once her views became known. It may be that no one other than Solov'ev himself knew pre- cisely what Anna Schmidt first wrote to him concerning her visions and revelations. However, it is possible to speculate that his brother Mikhail Sergeevich, who took possession of his papers, diaries and correspon- dence after Solov'ev's death in 1900, had direct access to these secrets. It is also possible that Mikhail Sergeevich's son, Sergei Mikhailovich Solov'ev, as well as Aleksandr Blok and Andrei Belyi who were close to the Solov'evs, were made privy to the intimate details of this affair. Apparently any "compromising" evidence was destroyed by Mikhail Sergeevich in order to protect his brother's reputation, although several sources exist which claim to have seen examples of strange papers, letters and even specimens of automatic or mediumistic writing well after the death of the philosopher.23 23 Ibid., p. 171. -3 "I recently had the opportunity - in 1922 - to examine several mysterious specimens of handwriting by Solov'ev which have remained unpublished even until now. These specimens are a special type of writing by the poet-philosopher which he made automatically while in a state of trance. This state (medium- like) was characteristic of Solov'ev at times. The theme of Solov'ev's record- ings invariably appears as a she, 'Sophia,' whether genuine or imagined, is another question. In any case the nature of the recordings is such that one need not doubt the 'demonism' of the experiences accompanying the spiritual experiment of this worshipper of the 'Maiden of the Radiant Gates.' " See Georgii Chulkov, Gody stranstvii. Iz Vospominanii (Moscow, 1930), p. 123. Chulkov's account is also substantiated by Andrei Belyi tthroughout his memoir literature, but particularly in "Vospominaniya ob A. A. Bloke," Epopeia, No. 1 (1922), p. 140.</page><page sequence="12">50 CANADIAN SLAVONIC PAPERS A few years after Solov'ev's death, when Sergei Bulgakov wrote to Anna Schmidt asking whether she had any valuable correspondence from Solov'ev that might be published in the journal Novyi put', she sent him copies of several letters but specifically requested that they were not to be published until some "mighty event" occurred or until after her death. One can only speculate as to her meaning. Was she expecting the culmination of her relationship with Solov'ev, the birth of her meta- phorical Son-Church, and the end of history, or perhaps some concrete manifestation of the fact that she was indeed the second incarnation of Margarita on earth? Of course, this is as much pure speculation as the intimations that, during their one brief meeting in the city of Vla- dimir, their "mystical romance" was physically consummated. Such was the nature of the succeeding years that this type of mystical, apo- calyptic eroticism was to serve as inspiration for an entire series of works, the two best examples being Andrei Belyi's Silver Dove (1910) and Valerii Briusov's Fiery Angel (1907). The extant correspondence between Anna Schmidt and Vladimir Solov'ev is limited and entirely one-sided. It consists only of the letters from Solov'ev to Schmidt. Their correspondence took place during the last months of Solov'ev's life, from March until June of 1900. Before March of 1900 Anna Schmidt apparently had no knowledge of Solov'ev and his works or ideas, but upon becoming acquainted with them she immediately entered into an exchange of letters with him which seems much more energetic and forceful on her part than on his. As far as can be estimated, she sent him, at the very least, some thirty letters and telegrams during the three or four months before his death. On the other hand, only some seven of Solov'ev's letters remain (plus four empty envelopes and a single telegram).24 All of his cor- respondence was despatched from his room at the "Hotel Angleterre" and was addressed to her at the "Nizhegorodskii Listok" in Nizhnii Novgorod. Anyone reading his letters will be disappointed to find nothing particularly "mystical" or "erotic," despite curious hints at sealed papers, bizarre revelations and the like.

SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 51 In the first letter, dated the 8th of March 1900, Solov'ev expresses his pleasure at hearing Schmidt's views on Christianity: Having read your letter with the greatest attention, I was happy to see how close you had drawn to the truth on a question of the greatest significance, incorporated into the very nature of Chris- tianity but not yet formulated clearly either in the consciousness of the church or general philosophy, although individual theoso- phists do speak about this aspect of Christianity (particularly Jakob Boehme and his followers: Gichtel, Pordage, Saint-Martin, Baader). Since 1877 I have found myself forced to deal with this question in public lectures, articles and books, maintaining a necessary caution. I think, on the basis of many facts, that the broad disclosure of this truth in the consciousness and life of Christianity and of all humanity is immanent in the near future, and your appearance seems to me to be very important and meaningful.25 Solov'ev goes on to say that he would like to become acquainted with the article she is presently preparing, with her autobiographical work, but mainly with Anna Schmidt herself. Since he is about to take a trip abroad, however, the meeting will have to wait until he returns. Further on he discusses the problem of the Universal Church: But even at this point I can dispel one misunderstanding in your letter, namely, concerning the Universal Church. At the present time the question of its convocation can have no practical meaning whatsoever for the reason that there is no one to convoke: papal authority is acknowledged only by catholics, whereas imperial authority is divided among independent governments: Russia, Germany, Austria and Britain. And besides this, the significance of the Universal Church consists merely of conclusively formulat- ing and professing those religious truths which have already been pronounced, whereas that truth which concerns you and me, still demands greater clarification.20 The letter ends with an expression of his desire to remain in contact with her. Obviously the letter is formal and polite, reflecting above all the rational thinker in Solov'ev, the rational proponent of Godmanhood and the Universal Church. Judging from his comments, it is unlikely 23 Vladimir Solov'ev. Pis'ma, p. 8. 'M Ibid., p. 9.</page><page sequence="14">52 REVUE CANADIENNE DES SLAVISTES that Anna Schmidt had disclosed any of her "revelations" concerning her connection with him but perhaps only those regarding the destiny of her personal life and the course of the Neo-Israelite Church. It should be borne in mind that irrational or mystical revelation is the common denominator between Solov'ev and Anna Schmidt, and ob- viously Solov'ev is interested in the appearance of another independent individual who apparently has experienced similar sophiological revela- tions. Nevertheless, he avoids giving his complete and enthusiastic support to Schmidt's visions, seeking refuge instead from this strange woman in rational discussion. In his next letter to her, at the end of March or the beginning of April 1900, he thanks her for her previous letter and also says that the papers which she has sent him will be kept sealed until she requests him to do otherwise. Apparently, she has told him of something that happened to her on the 4th of January, 1885. As far as may be gleaned from Solov'ev's comments, she had a vision or saw a strange being in a hotel where she was staying at that time. What exactly happened is not clear, but apparently the initials connected with this vision were I. R., and Solov'ev hazards the guess that they might stand for "Iuda Ras- kaiavshiisia" (Judas the Repentent). However, he adds that the per- son probably had a different surname, and it would doubtless be of little use to attempt to discover his identity from the hotel register. In con- clusion, Solov'ev reiterates his desire to meet her when time allows. The third letter is not of any great importance, but the fourth is rather tantalizing. On 22 April 1900 Solov'ev gently childes Anna Schmidt for confusing him at times with his older brother, Vsevelod Sergeevich Solov'ev, who ostensibly had some obscure dealings with Mme Blavatsky and wrote something on this account. Solov'ev himself emphatically denied any interest in, connection with, or support for Mme Blavatsky, her "miracles" and "foci."-7 Then he makes a very interesting remark about the fact that Anna Schmidt has sent him a copy of a poem that he wrote sometime before and which, because it -7 The denial of any connection or knowledge of Mme Blavatsky on Solov'ev's part is rather curious. In fact, Solov'ev had written an article on Mme Blavat- sky some eight years previously in 1892 entitled "Zametka ο Ε. P. Blavatskoi" in which it is apparent that he has read all of Mme Blavatsky's major works. His major criticism in the article is not of Mme Blavatsky or her popularization of Buddhism as much as it is his anxiety lest people turn entirely to Buddhism which he considers an incomplete and false teaching. The article is contained in Solov'ev's Sobranie Sochinenii, VI, pp. 394-400.</page><page sequence="15">Α. Ν. SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 53 appears to be a "better version" than the one presently in his posses- sion, he will use for the new edition of his poetry. He makes a rather vague but curious criticism of some remark that she has made concerning it: u ... out of this most simple fact you are drawing some com- plicated conclusions."28 Perhaps she drew some symbolic meaning from the poem (one of his mystical and sophiological works?), or felt that she had intuitively selected a version that enlightened their rela- tionship according to her own mystical revelations concerning Margarita and Raphael. However, in this letter Solov'ev is not very well disposed towards her and rebukes her rather severely for something she has writ- ten him in the form of a "confession" : Your confession arouses the greatest pity and speaks dolefully on your behalf before the Almighty. It is fine that you have written this now, but I beg you not to return to this subject again. When I depart for Moscow today, I shall burn the factual confession in both versions, not only for the sake of precaution, but also as a sign of the fact that all this is only ashes.29 What was Anna Schmidt's confession? Did it concern her self-avowed incarnation as Margarita and indicate Solov'ev as Raphael? Was it a recital of her revelations and tribulations? The fact that Solov'ev says that he will burn the confession because "all this is only ashes" is thought provoking. Does this mean that his own visions of Sophia have ceased and that, as he suggested in an earlier letter to Anna Schmidt, there is no longer any hope for the positive and non-destructive apoca- lypse leading to the Universal Church and Godmanhood? Does it mean that the only solution he sees is the catastrophic apocalypse which he outlines in "A Short Tale of the Antichrist" in which Sophia together with all of her attendant hypostases has completely disappeared? No doubt Anna Schmidt's personal conception of the divine syzygy of Margarita and Raphael and perhaps even of their terrestrial embodiment in herself and Solov'ev may have fallen on despairing ears. The mystery of it all is deepened by what follows. Solov'ev relates a dream that an old woman once had concerning him in order to teach Anna Schmidt some inscrutably symbolic lesson: 2* Vladimir Solov'ev, Pisma, p. 11. 29 Ibid., p. 12.</page><page sequence="16">54 CANADIAN SLAVONIC PAPERS And concerning what is behind all those ashes I shall relate to you the dream of a certain old woman who died a long time ago. She dreamt that she was given a letter from me, written in my usual script which she called pattes d'arraignée. Reading it with interest she remarked that inside there was folded up yet another letter on magnificent paper. Unsealing it, she saw words written in a beautiful script and in gold ink, and at this moment she heard my voice: "here is my real letter, but wait before you read it." Then she saw that I was entering, bending beneath the weight of an enormous sack filled with copper coins. I fetched out of it and threw upon the floor several coins one after the other, saying: "when all the copper is finished, then you shall be ready for the golden words." I advise you, Anna Nikolaevna, to take this dream unto yourself as well.30 Is Solov'ev referring to the premature nature of Schmidt's prophesies, her revelations concerning Margarita and the Church? Or to their own relationship, not yet consummated? At any rate, he does not appear very anxious to meet her immediately; although he offers to arrange a brief meeting with her in Vladimir on his way to Moscow, he clearly prefers to postpone their meeting until the end of the year. He adjures her not to discuss him with other people, but instead to pray as much as possible. The meeting in Vladimir took place in late April, but no one knows what transpired during its brief hours. From Solov'ev's point of view, at least, it was probably not the portentous meeting of Margarita and Raphael, of the earthly incarnation of Sophia and the poet-Godman. In his first letter afterwards he is as formal as before. He feels, however, that she is disturbed about her behaviour at the meeting: "Here are a few words of reassurance. I am well, and as before I preserve towards you the same unchanged feelings, interests and sympathies; no un- pleasant impression of the meeting with you has remained; in a word, all is as it was before."31 He ends this short letter by promising to write more often. In the final letter, dated 22 June 1900, Solov'ev seems to share Schmidt's premonitions of apocalypse: "I also think that the former historical thread has come to an end. But what lies ahead: it is not 30 Ibid. 31 Ibid., p. 13.</page><page sequence="17">Α. Ν. SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 55 granted to us to have knowledge of the times and dates."3- Then he tells her that he is going to the south of Russia in a few days and that he cannot possibly meet her in St. Petersburg as she had apparently requested. Concerning her doubts in regard to supernatural pheno- mena, Solov'ev replies: "I am very happy that you yourself have some doubt of the objective significance of certain visions and inspirations or comunications which you do not comprehend. To insist further on their doubtfulness would be, for my part, ungracious. "3:i He then pro- mises to write to her when he returns to St. Petersburg, probably in August. This fragmentary correspondence gives some indication of the real nature of this much-vaunted "mystical romance." Clearly, Solov'ev was an unwilling "lover"; he sought to avoid direct contact with Anna Schmidt and apparently did not quite know what to make of her ap- pearance and "confession." No doubt he was startled by the similarity between their sophiological revelations and premonitions of apocalypse, but at the same time he evinces no interest in playing Raphael to Margarita-Schmidt, despite the fact that she was to bear the Son-Church, the logical offspring, after all, of Solov'ev's own views on syzygal union and the Universal Church. Obviously Solov'ev himself must have been aware of his own para- doxical situation, caught as he was between rational and irrational ex- pressions of God's Divine Wisdom and the eternal striving for oneness. His encounters with the Divine Feminine, whether in the form of the divine love for Sophia, the natural love of the World Soul, or the earthly love of woman, were all premonitions of a future that had yet to arrive and which would lead to the union of the spiritual and the physical, to the union of Heaven and Hell. How natural and yet ironic it was that there should appear within such a context an answer to Solov'ev's ardent entreaties for syzygal union with this feminine spirit, the earthly incarnation of that divine bride in the person of Anna Schmidt. Anna Schmidt had the final word in their relationship. In an undated letter to a friend,'54 she gives a summation of her sentiments in regard to Solov'ev, the influence he exerted upon her life, and the providential similarity of their revelations: ^ Ibid. :&lt;:1 Ibid. :u Iz rukopisei, p. 272.</page><page sequence="18">56 REVUE CANADIENNE DES SLAVISTES . . . above all else I understood that the root of my family mis- fortunes and those of every person (i.e. it is better to say the despair and disillusionment caused by insignificant worldly mis- fortunes) was the division of the church. And I began to pray in secret not for my family, not for myself as an individual, but for humanity that it might be the one church. And in answer to my prayer there came that revelation which God gave me mira- culously through the invisible agency of Vlad. Serg. and which in 1900 was miraculously confirmed by the oneness of his belief with mine (after 14 years). This signified that in a new revelation God granted as well the means of that union of the Church that I had prayed for.3·* The "means of that union of the Church" that Schmidt had prayed for was, of course, Vladimir Solov'ev himself. While the metaphor may have been only illustratively sexual (in Solov'evian terms, the exem- plary union of two people according to the divine principle of all-in- oneness), there were erotic overtones which were seized upon at the time. Among the articles of Anna Schmidt's faith, listed in her Final Testa- ment, the seventh is of particular interest for it appears to hypostatize Solov'ev himself: And He who has ascended to the heavens, and sits on the right hand of the Father; remaining in his incorruptible body in heaven, twice having been incarnated on earth in the year 1853 in a human being, but who twice received in 1 876 a divine aspect in the vision of the Church in Egypt and soon shall descend to judge the quick and the dead, there will be no end to His kingdom.30 Of course, it is Solov'ev who was born in 1853 (in his human form or first incarnation) and was transformed or reborn in his spiritual nature in 1876 when he had the vision of Sophia in the Egyptian Desert which he recorded in his poem "Three Encounters." Nor is Schmidt at all circumspect in stating that she is the daughter of God and simultaneously mother and bride to Solov'ev who has become Christ. Her designation of the divine natures in both herself and Solov'ev is no more or less than the perfect expression of Solov'ev's own principles of Godmanhood as outlined in Lectures on Godmanhood and La Russie et l'Église Uni- Μ Ibid. !tJ Ibid., p. 273.</page><page sequence="19">Α. Ν. SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 57 verseile, and the function and end of love as presented in "The Meaning of Love." In the same letter we find that Schmidt offers the "sources" which, in fact, have affirmed these beliefs of hers: Read in the light of this profession of faith the poems of Vladimir Sergeevich: only then will they become completely comprehensive to you. Note that all his life he had a premonition of and waited for an unknown person, his feminine alter ego who was living somewhere, with a dual nature, with a dual spirit, earthly and heavenly. This is especially clear in the poems: "Not by the will of fate . . ." ["Ne po vole sud'by, ne po mysli liudei . . ."], "I see your emerald eyes . . ." ["Vizhu ochi tvoi izumrudnye . . ."], "Wherefore words . . ..?" [Zachem slova? V bezbrezhnosti lazur- noi . . ."]. That this person did not appear for so long was "amid deceptions the living deception";87 that she impeded the work of Vladimir] S[sergeevich] and that he died only with a faint hope; that he was tormented by the unearthly suffering of a fruitless ex- pectation throughout all his lonely life - in all of this is my car- dinal sin before him, before God, before humanity! But all the same I fear neither death nor the end of the world. I sense His blessed compassion, His inexpressible sympathy towards me when I say: "May no one love You as I do, for You have not forgiven anyone as much as You have me!"38 Here, in the final apotheosis, it is evident that Vladimir Solov'ev and Christ have become one for Anna Schmidt. However, Anna Schmidt's mystical search for her masculine counter- part did not cease with the death of Solov'ev in 1900. Until her own death in 1905 she continued to seek what she assumed to be the further earthly incarnations of Solov'ev among the Russian symbolist poets. Georgii Chulkov, Aleksandr Blok and Andrei Belyi in succession were confronted by this earthly incarnation of Sophia. The sophiological themes which had obsessed her in the works of Solov'ev led her to those early "disciples" of the poet-philosopher who took up the theme of the Divine Feminine with its attendant motifs of longing, syzygy and apocalypse. Having read Chulkov's first book of poems, "Kremnistyi put'" (1903), she paid him an unannounced midnight visit in Nizhnii Novgorod in 1903 and proceeded to read to him out of her manuscript, "The Third Testament": 37 This reference is from Solov'ev's poem "O, chto znachat vse slova i rechi. . . ." 38 Iz rukopisei, p. 273.</page><page sequence="20">58 CANADIAN SLAVONIC PAPERS Anna Nikolaevna opened my book [of poems] and directed my attention to three poems - "O, the strange gaze of the medium" [O, mediuma strannyi vzor] ... "I pray to you as to the sun, as to the day's radiance" [la molius' tebe, kak solntsu, kak si ian'ju dnia".] . . . and finally, my poetic rendition of 'The Song of Songs" [Pesn' Pesnei]. This gives me the right to demand of you your consideration for my "Third Testament" - she said quietly and solemnly.39 The appearance of Blok's first poems in Severnye tsvety and Novyi put' in 1903 and the subsequent publication of his Stikhi o Prekrasnoi Dame the following year, drew Anna Schmidt's attention to him. Accord- ing to the editors of the collected correspondence of Aleksandr Blok and Andrei Belyi,40 a letter from Anna Schmidt to Blok, written on 12 March 1903, is preserved in Blok's archives; "... she quite openly refers to the fact that she is the manifestation of none other than the earthly incarnation of the 'world soul,' Solov'ev's 'Sophia-Divine Wis- dom.' "41 In one of Blok's letters which was published in an earlier collection but for some reason omitted from the later Sobranie sochinenii (in 8 vols., M.-L., 1960-63), he writes to his mother: Anna Nik. Schmidt, in spite of the fact that I have never answered her, has once again written "for God's sake, arrange our meeting" and so on.

SCHMIDT AND VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV 59 sible only to me"*3 Apparently, her meeting with Blok (and the prior intercession of his friend Sergei Solov'ev, nephew of Vladimir) con- vinced Anna Schmidt that he was not to be her Raphael. At any rate, she received even less attention from Blok than she had earlier from the philosopher. Andrei Belyi, the third member of the "Solov'evian Circle," together with Blok and Sergei Solov'ev, also came face to face with Anna Schmidt, but apparently did not excite her sophiological mysticism as much as had the others. After Solov'ev's death Anna Schmidt began to hound the philosopher's gentle and hospitable brother, Mikhail Sergeevich, with her incomprehensible revelations and visions. He had taken upon himself the responsibility of publishing any of his brother's unfinished articles, papers, and so forth, and was greatly disturbed at the possible consequences of Anna Schmidt's former connection with his brother and with her continuing activities. Belyi, who first met her through Mikhail Sergeevich and Olga Mikhailovna Solov'ev, recalls the situa- tion: M[ikhail] S[ergeevich] hesitated to publish those excerpts of his philosopher-brother's unfinished articles which were connected with the theme of the deceased's poem "Three Encounters," because some insane Schmidt in Nizhnii Novgorod conceived of herself as the "world soul" who had inspired the deceased Solov'ev; this maniac badly upset M.S.; he constantly feared the birth of some mystical sect out of the depths of his brother's philosophy under the influence of Schmidt's ravings.44 Belyi refers to Anna Schmidt as representing the "type of Solov'evian fanatic"45 he was interested in as material for his satirical Symphonies; ostensibly with this purpose in mind he became acquainted with her and even exchanged letters with her as early as 1901.46 With her death in 1905, Anna Schmidt's name temporarily disap- peared from the literary-philosophical scene in Russia.47 However, the religio-mystical pattern of divine syzygy initiated in her "affair" with 43 A.

One has only to recall the farcical worship of Lidiia Dmitrievna Mendeleevna (the wife of Blok) as an earthly incarnation of Sophia or the Divine Feminine by the Solov'evian triad of Belyi, Blok and Sergei Solov'ev;4* or the demonic reversal of the theme in the love-triangle of V. Briusov, Belyi and Nina Petrovs- kaya which was supposedly portrayed in Briusov's novel The Fiery Angel (1907). The theme is manipulated over and over again by Belyi throughout many of his works. It is to be found in multiple varia- tion in three of his four Symphonies (the first, second and fourth) as well as the novels The Silver Dove and Petersburg. During Solov'ev's lifetime, Anna Schmidt was one of the few who seemed to grasp the essence of his Sophiology, the role of the feminine principle which, in fact, the Nizhnii Novgorod mystic attempted to assume. She also realized, of course, that this was the unique feature of Solov'ev's thought, and immediately seized upon it in his poetry and philosophy. Thus she perceived an indivisible link between the two which seemed to frighten even Solov'ev himself when she confronted him face to face with the inherent eroticism of the poetic longing for union between Solv'ev and Sophia, and the rational exegesis of the syzygy between heaven and earth. 48 The "Holy Trinity" of Sergei Solov'ev, Belyi and Blok, the role of Mende- leeva as Sophia and the enactments of this pseudo-serious farce are recorded particularly in A.

Schmidt and Vladimir Solov'ev Un des mystères bizarres de la vie personnelle de Vladimir Soloviev, et qui a profondément influencé la vie des symbolistes comme Andrey Bely et Alexandre Blok, porte sur les relations étranges entre le poète- philosophe et Anna Nikolaevna Schmidt. Ayant longuement développé dans ses traités philosophiques l'importance de la Féminine divine, en d'autres termes Sophia, la Sagesse divine, et ayant avoué dans ses poèmes en avoir eu des révélations divines et mystérieuses, Soloviev a attiré l'attention d'Anna Schmidt, une mystique russe méconnue de la fin du 19e siècle. La rumeur persiste qu'elle s'est présentée à Soloviev comme l'incarnation de cette Sophia divine, reconnaissant en lui l'image du Christ à laquelle elle devait s'unir pour donner naissance physique et spirituelle à l'Église universelle. La comparaison entre les écrits obscurs et presqu'inconnus d'Anna Schmidt et les écrits plus célèbres de Soloviev sur l'Humanité divinisée est effectuée dans le but de faire res- sortir les similitudes dans leurs révélations. Un examen attentif de leur correspondance, tout en mettant à jour des allusions surprenantes à des visions mystérieuses, à des confessions inouïes, et à des papiers secrets scellés, indique, avec d'autres preuves, que, à rencontre de l'opinion généralement admie, leur "amour mystique" n'a probablement jamais été consommé dans la réalité. Pourtant, cette bizarre histoire d'amour mi-terrestre, mi-divin, semble avoir fourni un modèle originel aux futurs poètes symbolistes russes qui prétendaient avoir eu des visions de la Féminine divine, des visions qu'ils ont non seulement rapportées dans leurs oeuvres littéraires, mais qu'ils ont vécues par imitation dans leur vie même.
