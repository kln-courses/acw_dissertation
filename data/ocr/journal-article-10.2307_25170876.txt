<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION HERMENEUTICS, DECONSTRUCTION, AND LINGUISTIC THEORY Manfred Frank's Response to Derrida and Searle DIETER FREUNDLIEB SUMMARY. This paper is an exposition as well as a critical examination of M. Frank's response to the Derrida/Searle debate. It argues that Frank's critique of Derrida and Searle is partly justified but suffers from a number of shortcomings. The author agrees with Frank's argument that Derrida fails to explain how linguistic meaning is possible on the basis of purely differential relations between signs (diff?rance) and supports his view that the human subject, in spite of its lack of complete self-transparency, is endowed with more autonomy and semantic creativity than Derrida is willing to grant it. The paper tries to show, however, that much of Frank's critique of linguistic theory as represented by the work of Searle is unjustified because it is informed by a questionable notion of linguistic determinism rooted in Schleiermacher and Saussurean structuralism, a notion of ineffable or non-conceptual individual meaning that remains insufficiently explicated, and a generally anti-naturalist attitude towards language which leads to a misunderstanding of the role linguistics and related cognitive sciences can (and cannot) play in the hermeneutic sciences. Key words: anti-naturalism, code, deconstruction, hermeneutics, linguistics, semiotics, subject. To date, the German response to French post-structuralism has, on the whole, been cautious, in some cases decidedly negative,1 and even in disciplines traditionally prone to new fashions such as literary criticism far less enthusiastic than in America. However, post-structuralism is certainly being taken seriously by a number of scholars in various disciplines. What I would like to do in this paper is to look at a specific case of a rather sophisticated engagement with the new French thought on the part of one German philosopher, Manfred Frank. While defending his own conception of a hermeneutic philosophy based on Schleiermacher, Frank has not only conducted a penetrating analysis of deconstruction but, at the same time, he has also been involved in a dispute with analytic philosophy. More specifically, he has launched a critique of linguistic theory as represented by John Searle and, though less directly, Noam Chomsky.2 There is, no doubt, something unique and original about the hermeneutic theory which Frank pits against both deconstruction and linguistic theory. While Frank draws on other writers such as Saussure and Gadamer, his indebtedness to Schleiermacher means that he has been emphasizing the Journal for General Philosophy of,Science 21: 183-203, 1990. ? 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">184 DISCUSSION importance of the individual more than any other contemporary philosopher in the hermeneutic tradition.3 But there is also something characteristically German about his response. While this 'Germanness' manifests itself in various ways many of which are no doubt very positive (such as his remarkable erudition, the way he puts the whole of post-structuralism in a historical perspective, the painstakingly detailed investigation of most of his opponents' arguments, and the profound seriousness of his intellectual and moral purpose), there is also another, more controversial, trait to be found in his work. What I have in mind is a rather obvious and occasionally somewhat strident anti-scientism and anti-naturalism common among many contemporary German philosophers as well as scholars in other areas of the humanities. In the context of Frank's response to the Derrida/Searle debate this leads, I believe, not only to a serious underrating of the achievements of contemporary linguistics and other cognitive sciences, but also to a profound misunderstanding of the nature of linguistics and the role it can (and cannot) play in the hermeneutic disciplines Frank is so concerned about. It is for this reason that Frank's response to the twin challenge of post-structuralism and linguistic theory might well be called ideological in the sense that he portrays his linguistic opponents in a way that serves his own purposes, but fails to do full justice to their work. It also makes him blind, I believe, to certain weaknesses in his own position and leads him to put forward empirical claims about language and the nature of linguistic meaning that are contrary to the best available evidence. To be sure, the general critique of what Frank sees as the scientism of linguistics and analytic philosophy of language is, in part, justified. But it all depends on what exactly is meant by 'scientism' for it seems to me that this criticism should primarily be directed at the anti-naturalism and logicism that is still being practised in areas such as formal (model-theoretic) semantics and certain brands of linguistics.4 The accusation of scientism should not and cannot be made, I believe, against Searle or Chomsky. In the view of both Searle and Chomsky - although they clearly differ in many other respects - linguistics as a science will only progress if it is informed by a thoroughly naturalistic attitude. Much of today's philosophy of language is concerned with issues that are clearly empirical in nature and thus more amenable to scientific investigation than to conceptual analysis. In other cases it is difficult to say which problems should be tackled by empirical linguistics and which are still, and necessarily, amenable to a purely philosophical investigation. In any event, there is, on the whole, a strangely anti-naturalist attitude to be found among many philosophers of language.5 It could be argued, in fact, that philosophers of language, in the tradition of formal logic as well as hermeneutic philosophers such as Frank, underestimate the capacity and the potential of linguistics as a natural science. In Frank's case we may say that his own anti-naturalism in fact implicitly supports the logicism still common among many analytic philosophers of language and is detrimental to his own theory of language</page><page sequence="3">DISCUSSION 185 and interpretation. Taking his lead from Saussure rather than Chomsky, Frank's theory is based on the assumption that language, in so far as it is amenable to scientific treatment, must be conceived of as a system of abstract elements and abstract rules which have some kind of virtual exis tence. These rules and conceptual elements need to be interpreted by the individual subject whenever the abstract elements and rules of language are put to use. It seems to me that this is a misleading conception of linguistic competence and performance to start with, but I do not wish to address this issue straightaway. Instead, I would like to begin with an exposition of what I think are the most important characteristics of Frank's herme neutics of the individual, for it is on the basis of this hermeneutic theory that he criticises both Derridean deconstruction and Searle's speech act theory. For the purposes of this exposition, I would like to divide Frank's general theory of hermeneutics into those parts which deal with a theory of the subject and of self-consciousness and those concerned with a theory of meaning and of interpretation. Let me start off, then, with the first, i.e. the theory of the subject. I. SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, THE SUBJECT, AND LINGUISTIC INTERPRETATION Throughout his work on hermeneutics, Frank claims to have based some of his main ideas on the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher who he believes was widely misunderstood because of both Dilthey's and, more recently, Gadamer's psychologistic interpretation.6 This misunderstanding was partly engendered by Schleiermacher's term 'divination' which describes a major aspect of any interpretive activity. More about this in a moment. What is important for Frank's theory of the subject or the individual is that Schleiermacher was one of the first philosophers within the German idealist tradition who claimed that what is commonly referred to as the reflection model of self-consciousness is wrong. Traditionally, self-reflection was conceived of as the bending back of the subject upon itself, a process whereby it recognizes itself as both the subject and the object of reflection. Self consciousness is thus thought of as a special case of the subject recognizing or identifying an object. The difference is simply that in this particular case the object happens to be the subject itself. Self-reflection in this sense was to be the point from which everything else in philosophy was to be derived. According to Frank, not only Schleiermacher but also the later Fichte (after 1794), Schelling, Kierkegaard, Sartre, and, among contemporary German philosophers, Dieter Henrich, realized that the reflection model of self-consciousness is untenable. The argument, put very briefly and no doubt oversimplifying somewhat, is that unless the self is already acquainted with itself in a pre-reflexive way, it could not possibly recognize itself when it looks upon itself as an object. The undeniable fact that there is such a thing as self-consciousness, even if this does not entail complete self</page><page sequence="4">186 DISCUSSION transparency, can only be explained on the basis of a self that is familiar with itself without first having to distance itself from itself, as it were, and then, miraculously, recognize the identity between the reflecting and the reflected upon subject. Now self-consciousness is only conceivable if the self is aware of something entirely other than itself as well. But what distinguishes Schleiermacher's theory of the self from the idealist tradition is that he does not try, as Hegel still did, to demonstrate that the 'Other' is still 'das Andere seiner selbst', i.e. the other of itself. According to Schleiermacher, the subject is aware that it is not the creator of its own origin. In fact, the subject realizes that its being, its 'Seinsgrund', is and will always be beyond its total grasp. In other words, the subject can never hope to achieve complete self-knowledge. For Frank this means that the finite subject is forced to determine and to project its own 'meaning', a conception very similar to Heidegger's idea of'Dasein' as 'geworfener Entwurf (i.e. thrown projection). And because the meaning projected by the subject cannot exist except within a whole semiotic and differential system, self-consciousness is mediated and to some extent dependent on a semiotic order. Note, however, that according to Frank, this leaves the subject, though no longer completely autonomous, with at least some power and self-determination as a historical agent. It also implies, importantly, that meaning still originates in the subject rather than somewhere outside it. Although each subject must create its own meaning within a system of already given meanings, the semiotic system as such does not create any meaning. This latter point will become important when we look at Frank's critique of Derrida. Frank obviously accepts Saussure's notion of the diacritical nature of the sign, i.e. the idea that what a sign means is determined not by any intrinsic qualities or by its relation to an external world of objects but by its differential relations to all other signs. But he nonetheless attributes to the subject the power to interpret each sign and to endow it with further meaning. As purely natural objects, differentially defined signifiers could never create any meaning at all. In other words, only the idea of a subject can account for the existence of meaning. Nonetheless, the power to create new meanings - over and above the meanings that every (already situated) subject has to take over from its predecessors and its social environment - is at the same time the consequence of its groundedness in a Being beyond its grasp. It is continually forced to interpret and reinterpret itself and the world it lives in. The subject is thus conceived of as a process rather than a fixed and stable entity. Schleiermacher - not surprisingly for a theologian - interpreted the subject's awareness of its dependence on a Being that transcends its complete understanding in a religious fashion. But Frank points out that we need not follow Schleiermacher's theological interpretation. The subject's recog nition of its dependence on something beyond its complete understanding is a thought common to Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, none of whom has</page><page sequence="5">DISCUSSION 187 given it a religious interpretation. Still, the fact remains, as Gadamer has put it, that ?un?berholbar liegt dem Dasein voraus, was all sein Entwerfen erm?glicht und begrenzt".7 The most characteristic feature of Frank's theory of the subject is perhaps that it conceives of each subject as absolutely individual. The subject as well as its meaning intentions are said to be individual in the strict sense of being unique and ultimately ineffable. Frank thus distinguishes between the universal, the particular (which can be derived from the universal as in the case of a singular instantiation of a universal property) and the individual which, as Frank alleges repeatedly, cannot be grasped concep tually nor can it be communicated.8 A further and largely unargued assumption in his conception of the subject is that in spite of its ultimate dependence, for its existence, on a transcendent being, it is capable of genuinely free, that is uncaused, action. Without seriously engaging in the complex and extensive debate surrounding the issues of human agency between causalists and intentionalists within the analytic tradition,9 he more or less takes the dichotomy of the natural and the human sciences for granted on the basis of the alleged fundamental difference between causal and motivational (or intentional) explanation. This theory of the subject, which I have just outlined very briefly and no doubt somewhat inadequately, is coupled with a theory of language and interpretation also based, to a large extent, on Schleiermacher and Saussure. Along with Schleiermacher and the Romantics who first pro mulgated this idea, Frank accepts the view that languages are not just different instruments for expressing the same universal truths of reason as Enlightenment thinkers argued but embody particular and historically and culturally variable world views.10 Thus the distinction between languages embodying a world view and grammars as rule systems guiding the expression of whatever content might be conceivable is deliberately blurred. Speaking a language allegedly already commits one to a particular world view. In fact, Frank goes so far as to say that no new knowledge could be acquired if we always followed the rule system of an inter subjectively accepted and pre-existing grammar.11 But while Frank tends to blur the distinction between grammar and systems of beliefs, he distinguishes clearly between grammars as abstract systems of rules and their individual interpretation and ap plication by individual speakers. Adopting Saussure's opposition between langue and parole which is prefigured in Schleiermacher's work, he conceives of langue as something that has only a virtual existence. Language and its signs have a concrete existence only as actually used, which means that the rules of grammar and the signs of language as they manifest themselves in speech and writing are always already interpreted by an individual and thus no longer identical with their abstract counterparts in the linguistic system. He also insists that the abstract system of rules is not only modified by its application in each concrete case but that the system as such is constantly being eroded by time. Language only exists as a used system</page><page sequence="6">188 DISCUSSION and is therefore subject to temporality. Consequently, there can be no complete identity of meaning over time, and the Kantian idea of pure and tunelessly valid concepts of understanding becomes unacceptable. With every instance of language use the system of linguistic elements is at least slightly modified because the modification brought about in concrete cases will eventually infiltrate and rework the system itself. In order to account for the mediation between system and its application in actual communication, Schleiermacher postulates the existence of a schematism, not unlike the one Kant posited, to mediate between pure concept and sensory intuition.12 Schleiermacher refers to language itself as a general schematism by which a speech community orders its experience of the world. But the schema also has the important function of mediating between universal concepts and their individual application through which they are necessarily modified and individualized. Language as such is thus guided by two principles: a universalizing tendency which makes commu nication possible and reduces interpretation to a minimum and an indi vidualizing tendency which tries to do justice to the particularity of the individual subject and its specific intuitions ('Anschauungen') and intentions. It is the latter which makes semantic innovation possible and interpretation and 'divination' necessary. It also implies that there is no ultimate unity of meaning. Another reason why signs are said to be indeterminate in their meaning lies in the diacritical nature of the sign combined with the alleged fact that the number of signs to which each sign is differentially related is infinite. Not only is a sign said to somehow contain the meanings accumulated by its own history, but each sign is related to the signs of a system which is open into the future and thus implicated in a process of permanent modification.13 A further complication of this situation is brought about by the fact that the individual meaning intentions of a writer or a speaker cannot, at their point of origin, be encoded because no code is available for the expression of individual meaning intentions. But they may eventually become conventional and thus part of the code which is then, in turn, reinterpreted by subjects. Because of their existence outside the pre-given code, individual meanings are difficult to determine for the hearer or reader. In each case of text comprehension, the reader is confronted with the problem of how the ineffable meaning intentions of the individual author can be 'divined'. Complete comprehension seems impossible and every interpretation is at the same time a creative modification of meaning brought about by the individual reading subject. To the free creation of meaning on the part of an author, though restrained by the linguistic system previously inter nalized, corresponds an equally free act of divination on the part of the reader. To what extent the two overlap can never be exactly determined. Nonetheless, Frank claims that interpretations of individual meaning intentions, which by definition lie outside the code of a language, are not</page><page sequence="7">DISCUSSION 189 haphazard but motivated. What exactly this motivation is based on is difficult to say, however. As we will see later on, Frank cannot provide any clear methodological rules that would guide what he calls divination. He conceives of semantic creativity as something that is eo ipso beyond and outside grammar and thus also beyond scientific and systematic investigation. Hence interpretation on the part of the reader must needs be a form of art rather than a methodologically controlled activity. Another characteristic of Frank's theory of language is that he accepts Schleiermacher's idea that no thinking is possible without the use of language. No language-independent thought is conceivable. Thinking is inner speech. Thus Frank approvingly cites Schleiermacher's remark that 'the individual is determined in his thinking by the shared language and can only think those thoughts for which the language has provided the appropriate signs'.14 However, on other occasions, this linguistic deter minism is not accepted entirely. For Frank it is always the subject that speaks, not language itself as Heidegger and Gadamer would have it. Disregarding the results of empirical linguistics according to which syntax is one of the most stable aspects of any language, Frank - following Schleiermacher's and Sartre's notion of style - argues that it is the combinatorial freedom at the level of word order that makes the expression of individual meanings possible.15 Individual meaning manifests itself in the style of a text. Frank's acceptance of the idea of linguistic determinism, though leaving some room for individual modification, also has epistemic consequences. While he insists that Being, for example the Being of the subject, is beyond our complete understanding, whatever Being can be understood seems to be affected by language in the sense that language plays a transcendental role in our understanding of the world. This, at least occasionally, leads Frank to adopt a form of linguistic or semiotic idealism and a distinctly anthropomorphic interpretation of reality. Thus, at the end of his book Die Unhintergehbarkeit von Individualit?t, he argues (drawing on Peirce) that 'physical causes are [...], in the last instance, reasons in the sense that the mode of being of the physical is revealed as that which it is on the basis not of perceptions but perceptual judgments and thus interpretations'.16 This is a peculiar argument which confuses the fact that we have reasons for believing something to be the case with the intrinsic nature of the object of our belief. It seems to be the result of Frank's firm commitment to a form of linguistic determinism and to the idea that there are no objective facts but only interpretations. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that Frank subscribes to a consensus theory of truth in spite of the fact that because of the irreducibly individual meaning of linguistic expressions, the par ticipants in a dialogue can never be entirely sure about the meaning of what is said.17 The ultimate standard for the correct following of rules and the comprehension of meaning is the pragmatic one of communal acceptance in the context of social interaction.</page><page sequence="8">190 DISCUSSION II. FRANK'S CRITIQUE OF DECONSTRUCTION Let me now move on to Frank's response to Derrida and Searle as representatives of deconstruction and linguistic theory respectively. Begin ning with Derrida, I would like to point out from the start that I don't wish to go into a detailed discussion of the account Frank has given of Derrida's relation to Hegel and Husserl, though I do want to say a few things about Derrida's critique of Husserl and the way Frank assesses it. But I hope a restriction to what I believe to be the main arguments for and against Derrida put forward by Frank will not do his work too much injustice. It is also necessary to be aware that Frank differentiates quite clearly between Derrida's work and that of a number of other French post structuralists. Although there are obviously a number of common traits to be perceived, we should take note of the many differences as well. Frank's critique of Derrida does not necessarily apply to post-structuralism as a whole. Building on the distinction I drew earlier between Frank's theory of the subject and his theory of language and interpretation, I suggest that we look at his critique of Derrida again from the perspective of these two theories, although, as we shall see, it becomes more and more difficult to keep the two separate. A first general point that could be made is that Frank shows that Derrida is simply wrong when he claims that in the tradition of metaphysics knowledge and self-consciousness have always been conceived of as self presence. As Frank demonstrates, some idealist philosophers and writers (the later Fichte, Schelling, Novalis) as well as Schleiermacher had already realized that the subject is dependent, for its existence, on a being that transcends, in principle, its own cognitive capacities. Complete self-trans parency was thus shown to be an illusion long before Derrida drew our attention to it. But whereas Derrida is correct in pointing out our dependence on something entirely 'other', he overshoots the mark, according to Frank, when he tries to explain self-consciousness entirely in terms of 'diff?rance', that is to say an 'ultra-transcendental' principle which is seen as that which makes self-consciousness and meaning possible, but also forever divides the subject from itself. As this idea is in part developed by Derrida in his engagement with Husserlian phenomenology, we will have to address his arguments in this debate a bit more closely. Of course this is also an area where the theory of the subject and the theory of language intersect. Derrida wants to show that Husserl's idea of a transcendental ego as the foundation of all self-evident knowledge is untenable for two main reasons. One has to do with Husserl's attempt to ground language in pre semiotic or pre-expressive meaning; and the other relates to what Derrida sees as the inescapable temporality of both language and the self. Frank accepts, more or less, both arguments but in the end disagrees with Derrida's account of self-consciousness. Now Derrida bases his argument against the</page><page sequence="9">DISCUSSION 191 possibility of a pre-expressive meaning in Husserl, to a large extent, on Saussure's theorem of the diacritical nature of the sign, and we have seen that Frank accepts this notion without ever questioning it seriously. As both Frank and Derrida point out, Husserl himself was aware of the problem of how pre-expressive meaning could be mapped onto the sensory signifier and what effect, if any, the signifier might have on the signified. Derrida takes up Husserl's metaphor of the weaving together of the two strata, that of meaning and that of expression, and argues that meaning is always dependent on the existence of a system of signifiers. Allegedly, and Frank agrees with him here, no distinct element of meaning can exist without being simultaneously interwoven with a system of expressible elements; the interior and the exterior are said to collapse into each other. As Frank observes: Here Husserl himself encounters the consequence he studiously tried to avoid, i.e. that there cannot be any pre-expressive meaning, firstly, because every meaning intention is dependent on the use of meanings and, secondly, because meanings, in turn, are interwoven with expressions. The smallest and most elementary unit of all thought is the sign; a pre linguistic self-perception is impossible.18 According to Frank, Husserl is forced, at least in part, to confront this consequence - against his own will - because he holds on to the reflection model of self-consciousness. But this is not entirely convincing. Admittedly, in the reflection model there is no pre-reflective self-consciousness of intentional acts. But the dependence of self-consciousness on language only follows if the idea of the diacritical nature of the sign and the interwovenness of meaning and signification has already been accepted. The validity of this conception is presupposed by Frank's argument that 'there is also no pre-linguistic self-consciousness of intentional acts if it is the case that a distinction between different noemata is itself only possible on the basis of distinctions between expressions'.19 But its validity cannot be taken for granted. For both Frank and Derrida the inseparability of meaning and expression (in the sense of the signifier) means that Husserl's attempt to bracket the physical world in order to provide a foundation for knowledge within the realm of the purely ideal was bound to fail. But the reason for this failure is not just located in the alleged fact that meaning cannot exist except as a function of a differential system of signifiers which implants something corporeal into the mental and which, to make matters worse, is open-ended and thus prevents any sign from being identical with itself. The process of self-reflection also introduces an element of temporality into the unity and self-presence of the transcendental ego. Husserl himself was very much aware of the problem temporality posed for his whole project. For obvious reasons we cannot here go into the very detailed analysis Frank devotes to the question of how Husserl tries to retain the idea of the unity of the self in the face of the temporality of each intentional act. In order</page><page sequence="10">192 DISCUSSION to avoid the contamination, as it were, of presence by a past that cannot be completely re-presented, Husserl postulates retention as a form of immediate and pre-reflective access to what has just passed. The constant transition from what is present to the mind to what becomes an immediate past in retention is meant to explain our consciousness of the flow of time. But as Derrida has argued, our internal time consciousness is always affected by what is not yet or no longer present. And as Frank says: 'Husserl himself had admitted that the "living self-presence" of the ego is swamped by a penumbra of non-present non-givens which undo the "adequacy" of its self-givenness'.20 In the end, Husserl is forced to concede that we have to conceive of the unity of the ego as a regulative idea rather than a self-evident truth; but, as Frank is quick to remind us, this is precisely the point where Derrida intervenes and exposes the untenability of Husserl's notion of the self-present transcendental ego. Thus in Speech and Phenomena Derrida says: In its critical as well as descriptive work, The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness demonstrates and confirms the irreducibility of re-presentation (Vergegenw?rtigung, Repr? sentation) to presentative perception {Gegenw?rtigen, Pr?sentieren), secondary and reproductive memory to retention, imagination to the primordial impression, the re-produced now to the perceived or retained actual now, etc. [...]. One then sees quickly that the presence of the perceived present can appear as such only inasmuch as it is continuously compounded with a nonpresence and nonperception, with primary memory and expectation (retention and protention).21 Frank attributes most of Husserl's problems in the analysis of time consciousness to the fact that his theory of the subject is still based on the model of reflection. But while Husserl realized that he could not solve all of his problems without going beyond this model, he never really abandoned it. Now Frank supports much of Derrida's critique of Husserl but insists that Derrida, too, is unable or unwilling to drop the model of reflection. Because he cannot or will not entertain the idea of a pre reflective intimacy of the subject with itself, he is forced to explain self consciousness - whose existence he by no means denies - through 'diff?rance' and concludes that the subject is divided in itself. But as Frank shows, neither meaning nor self-consciousness can be the mere effect of the differential play of signifiers. Differentiality is for Frank a necessary but by no means sufficient condition for the existence of meaning. Outside human consciousnesses differences may still be differences, but that is all they can be. Differential relations between natural objects cannot, mira culously, create meanings. According to Frank, not even Saussure himself ever suggested they could. So while Frank goes along with Derrida a considerable part of the way, he doesn't accept his theory of the subject.</page><page sequence="11">DISCUSSION 193 III. LINGUISTIC 'SCIENTISM' AND THE DECONSTRUCTIONIST ACCOUNT OF MEANING Frank is fighting a battle on two fronts. Against Derrida he insists on the prior acquaintance of the subject with itself and provides it with at least a minimum of self-determination and the power to interpret, and thus modify, pre-given systems of meaning. But he also wishes to defend the subject and its meaning-creative capacity against what he sees as the rigid scientism of linguistic theory and what he calls the 'code model' of language. I suggest that we first have a brief look at some of Frank's general assumptions about science and scientific knowledge and then move on to his critique of Searle. This more specific critique of linguistic theory will lead us back to some of Derrida's ideas because Frank looks at Searle in the context of the well-known debate that took place several years ago between Derrida and Searle. As I indicated at the beginning of this paper, Frank's work is an example of a form of anti-scientism common among scholars of the humanities in Germany. By arguing that scientific knowledge is always, necessarily, concerned with the universal rather than the individual, Frank excludes the domain of hermeneutics from any scientific investigation right from the start. The validity of this move depends, of course, on what exactly is meant by the 'individual'. We will see later that this is a crucial issue because it has important implications for the methodology of all interpretive sciences. If the individual is a priori inaccessible to conceptual analysis as Frank seems to be saying, at least most of the time, then his project of a hermeneutics of the individual cannot possibly be amenable to a sys tematic treatment and seems to lie outside the realm of scientific metho dology. While Frank does not discuss recent issues in the philosophy of science, some of his views on science can be reconstructed from his writings on hermeneutics. Thus he seems to be convinced that science is always inclined to exclude the subject from serious consideration. Furthermore, he attributes to all science the early positivist idea that the language of science must aspire to complete determinacy and stability of meaning. Drawing on Schleiermacher and Humboldt, he argues that semantic innovation is characteristic of poetic language but allegedly is repressed by the language of science.22 Science in general is accused of subscribing to a 'totalitarian' form of rationality, and linguistics purportedly adheres to a certain 'regularity fetishism'.23 Thus Frank often sees the linguistic rules reconstructed by linguistics as a kind of law enforcement which restricts the individual rather than as enabling him or her to express and communicate thoughts.24 Contrary to the self-understanding of Chomskyan linguistics, Frank asserts that linguistics as a science is concerned with rule systems and their elements as ideal objects which only have a virtual existence. These rule systems</page><page sequence="12">194 DISCUSSION and their elements are internalized by the individual, a process which allegedly always involves an interpretation of the system, and they are 'r?ckent?u?ert' or 're-alienated' in the production of speech or writing. But this process of interpretation and modification is denied by linguistics because it cannot be accounted for by an appeal to conventional rules or a 'code'. Linguists, in Frank's view, firmly believe in the socalled 'code model' of language which means that individual interpretation is excluded from consideration. Ideally, if we always followed the rules of the code, hermeneutics would be superfluous because the code determines in advance what any single or complex linguistic expression means. Linguistic theory tries to account for the whole of language on the basis of the code model. Against this Frank argues that when we conduct a conversation we always expect a gliding of the meaning beneath the expressions we use; after all, we learn something new from our communication with others or with a book. Our world is enriched and our economy of meaning is enhanced. How would this be conceivable, if we were the talking machines which the automata theory of the analytic philosophers makes us out to be.25 Now I'll come back to these accusations later. Rather than discussing them now, I would like to move on to Frank's intervention in the debate between Searle and Derrida. Frank begins his discussion of the debate by pointing out what both Searle and Derrida considered to be a minimal consensus between them, namely, the idea that any element of a semiotic system, qua type, must be repeatable or iterable. Whenever a type is used it becomes a token of this particular type. Where Searle and Derrida differ, however, is in their assessment of the implications of this iterability of every sign. For Searle iterability means identical repetition because it is in the nature of a rule of language that it can be applied recursively to the same element. According to Frank, Searle believes in the conventionality of all linguistic rules which, in addition, must be finite in number. Speaker and hearer use the same system of rules which makes communication a process of encoding and decoding. The intentions of individual speakers can only be formed at all if they conform to some conventional rule of language, whether this rule is semantic or pragmatic. Frank admits that Searle concedes that a speaker's intentions may be 'more or less perfectly realized by the words uttered',26 but argues that the whole problem of hermeneutics is hidden in the notion of a 'more or less perfect' realization. Now it is Derrida who claims that there is no guarantee that any repetition of a sign preserves the identity of the original. This is of course true, but it doesn't amount to more, initially, than a radical but ultimately empty and self-destructive skepticism about memory of the kind Kripke has attributed to Wittgenstein.27 However, Derrida has further reasons for attacking the idea of the identity of the meaning of signs over time. Initially, Frank reports him as saying that there is a certain continuity in commu</page><page sequence="13">DISCUSSION 195 nication provided by what Derrida calls a 'restance non-pr?sente d'une marque diff?rentielle'. This 'marque' is interpreted by Frank as the material signifier (the ?Zeichenh?lse"). But it is not at all clear what this could contribute to the identity of meaning, particularly since we know that the different tokens of a signifier are never completely identical at a physical level. But Derrida is not interested in what might be identical anyway. Not surprisingly then, he again uses the radicalized version of Saussure's theory of the diacritical nature of the sign to support his argument that meanings cannot remain identical over time. The meaning of a sign is allegedly constituted by its differences to all other signs in the system. But since the system itself is conceived as open-ended and because no context of use is ever exactly the same, no sign can stay identical across its repetitions. In fact, Derrida even claims that no sign is ever identical with itself because of its differential relations to a potentially infinite number of other signs. Unlike Frank, however, who attributes the individual modifications of signs, which allegedly occur in every instance of use, to the meaning-creative power of the subject, Derrida accounts for the indeterminacy and non self-identity of the sign in terms of the primordial principle of differentiality or 'diff?rance'. Frank can thus say that both Derrida and Searle, though for different reasons, fail to avail themselves of the idea of a meaning giving and meaning-changing subject.28 Now so far I have tried to be largely expository and have refrained, on the whole, from launching any major criticism of my own. It is now time to move into a more critical mode. IV. THE NATURE AND ROLE OF LINGUISTICS I said at the beginning that Frank's anti-scientism and anti-naturalism leads him to misunderstand the nature of linguistics and to underestimate its achievements and that because of this he fails to see what the proper role of linguistic science might be within or vis-?-vis hermeneutics. So what did I mean by that? Let me begin with some general comments regarding Frank's attitude towards science. Frank claims that science cannot come to grips with the individual because scientific knowledge is always conceptual knowledge and designed to be applicable to general and repeatable phenomena. This is indeed the case. While it could be pointed out that a number of natural sciences such as astronomy and meteorology often deal with singular events, it is true that they usually treat these as cases to be subsumed under general laws. But the question Frank needs to answer is what exactly the ontological status of the individual is and how it can be known at all if it is not amenable to conceptual representation. It would be foolish to deny that there are forms of knowledge that are not conceptual or propositional. (For example, we know how to ride a bicycle, but we couldn't say that this constitutes conceptual knowledge). But this type of practical knowledge</page><page sequence="14">196 DISCUSSION doesn't seem to fit what Frank has in mind. According to Frank, it is possible for individual meanings to become part of the general code once they have been shared by at least two persons, and on at least one occasion Frank even says that while individual meaning, at the point of its origin, is in a non-conceptual state, it becomes 'conceptually commensurable' once it has been understood.29 But if this is the case, it is no longer plausible to argue that individual meaning is beyond scientific treatment. Most of the subject matter of the natural sciences is itself not of a conceptual nature, with the exception, perhaps, of cognitive psychology. Frank's characte risation of individual meaning as originally pre-conceptual also seems to militate against his insistence, on other occasions, that the smallest unit of thought is the sign and that Husserl's postulation of a pre-expressive meaning is unwarranted. In any case, it seems that Frank's defence of individual meaning as beyond science and beyond what he calls the 'code model' of language is far from convincing. The problem largely arises because for Frank there is only the alternative between strictly coded meaning and individual and therefore non-coded meaning. This is why he regards language as the 'individual universal' ('das individuelle Allgemeine'). As grammar it belongs to the conceptual and universal, as used it is always co-determined by individual meaning intentions. Now if these are the only two options, it is not surprising that Frank cannot account for the full complexities of an analysis of the expression and comprehension of linguistic meaning. Of course it is necessary to go beyond a simplistic code model if one wants to explain linguistic com munication. But it seems that Frank is not aware of the much more sophisticated accounts that are now available in linguistics and in cognitive psychology. Chomsky himself has argued that semantics is impossible unless it takes into account our knowledge of the world, and this is clear evidence that a simple code model cannot possibly explain how text comprehension is possible. Equally as questionable as Frank's conception of individual meaning is his belief in some kind of grammatical determinism. He seems to have overlooked the empirical evidence that has by now been accumulated showing that the Humboldtian and Whorfian idea of grammars or languages as determining a whole world view is untenable.30 Frank's own writings are living proof that it is possible, within the framework of the German language, to argue very strongly against what he takes to be the untenable views of his intellectual opponents. Whatever beliefs can be expressed in a language can also be denied because no human language is without grammatical means for negation. Nonetheless, Frank assumes that grammars are restrictions on what we can think and believe rather than representations of a linguistic competence which allows human beings to express whatever is conceivable. In addition, whatever limitations there may in fact be, it is always possible to go beyond these, at least in principle, and one need not postulate some mysterious creation of individual meaning to account</page><page sequence="15">DISCUSSION 197 for it. Frank seriously misunderstands the sciences when he argues that semantic innovation is repressed there in the name of a universal and semantically determinate language. The rationalist and positivist ideal of a universal and unambiguous language of science had always been misguided and empirically wrong if taken as a description of what actually goes on in the sciences. It has therefore long been discarded. The sciences are in fact characterized by their constant semantic innovation which, to some extent, often filters through to ordinary language. More important than Frank's misconception of the language of science in our context is his interpretation of linguistics. To begin with, linguists in the tradition of Chomsky do not regard rule systems as abstract objects which are, by themselves, 'silent' and must be 'interpreted' and brought to life, as it were, by individual subjects. For Chomsky, rules of grammar do not have a 'virtual' existence. They simply form part of a cognitive competence, physically realized in the brain, which is completely beyond the conscious knowledge of native speakers. The rules and principles of grammar could not possibly be objects of interpretation. In any case, even Frank would have to admit that any interpretation of a grammar, if it in fact occurred, would have to be based on a prior tacit knowledge of language and meanings which is given to us as part of our natural cognitive capacities. For interpretation itself is only possible if we are already equipped with a certain linguistic capacity to carry out this task. So an impending infinite regress can only by avoided by postulating a linguistic capacity which needs no further interpretation to be operative.31 What is, of course, always open to challenge is whether the semantic capacities we already possess as pre-linguistic children are reliable as descriptions of the external world or whether they are simply a useful starting point for a subsequent process of life-long learning. But this is a question which goes beyond linguistics and semiotics. Like most structuralists, Frank tends to regard linguistic rules as purely conventional. Yet it seems to me that this is a form of anti-naturalism which can only impede scientific progress in linguistics because it prevents the discovery of deep and complex cognitive principles specific to human languages. For the Chomskyan linguist, the conventional aspect of linguistic rules is the most uninteresting part of the story because it tells us nothing about the general biological principles underlying human languages. A further structuralist element in Frank's conception of linguistics, as I pointed out earlier, is his uncritical acceptance of the idea of the diacritical nature of the sign. Again there is considerable and, in my view, irrefutable evidence that this commonly accepted notion is untenable. To begin with, it is psychologically totally implausible that the meaning of any particular word in a language should be affected by the meaning of several hundred thousand other lexical items of a language such as English.32 Also, if there was nothing positive about the meaning of a term and if it was constituted only negatively by the differences between it and the rest of the vocabulary,</page><page sequence="16">198 DISCUSSION every word would actually have the same meaning because its meaning would consist of the some totality of differential relations. Structuralists are thus very careful when they contrast meanings with each other. No one, to my knowledge, has ever argued that we cannot understand what 'tree' means unless we also understand what 'oligarchy', 'grandmother' and 'courage' mean. Yet why should these differential relations be less important than those between, say, 'tree' and 'bush'? In any case, empirical research in human categorisation has clearly demonstrated that the way we categorise the world is far from arbitrary and probably in part determined by causal relations between the human cognitive system and the nature of the external world. An important fact to remember in this connection is also that categorisation is not tied to linguistic representation. If thought was impossible without linguistic signs as Frank claims, no child could ever learn a language. For example, pre-linguistic children must already have a concept of sameness before any language learning can take place. Otherwise they would not even be able to recognize certain speech sounds as 'the same' in relevant respects. Another point that needs to be made is that Frank more or less ignores the fact that linguists do not claim to be able to explain completely how actual (real-life) communication takes place. Both Chomsky's syntactic theory and Searle's theory of speech acts are competence theories. They do not purport to be able to account for actual utterances whose situational meaning may be affected in innumerable and unpredictable ways. Such an idealization is perfectly justifiable as long as it can be shown that other factors relevant to language production and comprehension are better accounted for by additional and different types of theory. Furthermore, semantic theories today, at least within cognitive psychology, no longer regard concepts as consisting of a finite number of necessary and jointly sufficient semantic atoms, an approach which turns concepts into the abstract and fully determinate meanings which Frank sees as being in need of individual interpretation. Eleanor Rosch's theory of prototypes, Jacken doff s semantics of 'preference rules', and the schema theories of cognitive psychologists, for example, all try to account for inherently fuzzy categories which are always open to contextually induced changes. But not only these theorists but Searle himself has developed the notion of the 'background of meaning' which means that understanding even a simple sentence such as 'the cat is on the mat' requires a vast range of background assumptions about objects, gravity, and spatial relations.33 Frank has no reason, therefore, to accuse Searle of adhering to a conception of meaning that only fits a rigid and simplistic code model. The trouble with Frank's critique is that because of his oversimplifying conception of what linguistics is all about, he is driven to the idea of a mysterious individual production and divination of meaning whenever he encounters phenomena that lie outside the simple code model. It is interesting to note, in this context, that he repeatedly draws on Dan Sperber's book Rethinking Symbolism in order</page><page sequence="17">DISCUSSION 199 to show that certain phenomena cannot be treated by the code model.34 Sperber, quite rightly, attacks the semiotic approach in anthropology by showing that comprehending symbolism just cannot be accounted for within the confines of semiotics. In his later book Relevance, written together with Deirdre Wilson, he even says that semiotics' institutional success stands in stark opposition to its intellectual failure.35 But what Frank consistently ignores in his references to Sperber is that Sperber is not at all saying that semiotically inaccessible symbolic phenomena cannot be explained in a scientific cognitive theory. Not all communication of meaning is code based. In fact, it seems that very little of what happens when we understand a text can actually be accounted for in this way. But the alternative is not to postulate interpretative 'divination'. The term 'divination' may well be a reasonably adequate description of what happens in natural processes of text comprehension at an intuitive level. People manage to understand utterances on the basis of linguistic and cognitive capacities of various kinds that interact in complex ways, usually below the level of consciousness. But that doesn't mean that the cognitive processes involved are not, in principle, amenable to systematic theorisation. Now this difference between the intuitive exercise of a cognitive capacity in processes of comprehension or interpretation and its theoretical expla nation within the cognitive sciences leads me to what I regard as the most important, though common, misconception of the relation between lin guistics and hermeneutics in Frank's work. What linguistics and a suitably extended approach to text comprehension in the cognitive sciences can do is to explain why it is that a text is understood in certain ways, i.e. why it has the meaning it is thought to have by the members of a speech community. Some of the early structuralists were aware of the important distinction between interpretation, based on our intuitive knowledge of language (which can, of course, be refined to deal with specific poetic conventions) and the explanation of why a text is understood in the way it is. The latter aim is an explanation on the basis of an explicit reconstruction of the linguistic rules and other sense-making strategies which readers bring to bear on a text and which guided the author's act of writing a text. Jonathan Culler, as late as 1975, was still convinced that we need to explain why literary texts have the meaning they have when he published his book Structuralist Poetics. His notion of literary competence was clearly modelled on Chomsky's explanatory concept of linguistic competence, and in spite of the many problems which Culler overlooked when he set up this analogy, the idea that literary interpretation could be replaced or made an object of systematic investigation was basically sound.36 What Frank fails to see is that a structuralist or a linguistics based analysis could never 'deduce' the meaning of a text by applying grammatical rules to it, even if there was no 'individual meaning' which he claims is beyond grammar. His repeated use of the term 'discovery procedures' which he attributes to the linguistic approach is doubly</page><page sequence="18">200 DISCUSSION misleading. The idea that linguistics could establish such procedures had already been thoroughly rejected in Chomsky's early work and in any case, semantics can only explain, by making our semantic competence explicit, how the comprehension of utterances or, if appropriately developed, whole texts comes about. It is precisely the intuitive knowledge of meanings which forms the object of investigation of semantics. Thus, instead of competing with interpretation, it takes interpretations as its starting point and re constructs the cognitive capacities and processes which make interpretation possible. When Frank argues that meanings can't be 'deduced' from grammar he is right, but for the wrong reason. The reason is not that there are individual meanings which no systematic approach can account for and which need to be guessed and 'divined'. There clearly are meanings which are not code-based; but there is no a priori reason why they cannot be accounted for by more sophisticated theories of discourse comprehension as they have been developed over the last fifteen or twenty years and will no doubt be developed further in the future.37 The work that has been done so far also allows us to understand why textual meanings will always be, to a certain degree, indeterminate. The main reason for this indeterminacy is that it has become obvious that we cannot clearly distinguish between purely linguistic meaning (code know ledge) and knowledge of the world.38 If the application of world knowledge to texts is necessary - and there is no doubt that it is in a major way - then it follows that there cannot be any obvious limit to how much and what knowledge can be relevantly applied in processes of text com prehension.39 Even at the level of single referring expressions, for example natural kind terms, it is now widely accepted that encyclopedic knowledge plays a significant role in our understanding of these terms in the context of real communication. The fact that a systematic linguistics-based approach to the study of texts can only be explanatory and is in need of a prior intuitive understanding of a text as its object of investigation means that hermeneutic interpretation and linguistic analysis are not competing with each other in the sense that each one claims to be better at doing the same thing. Rather, they are complementary because pursuing quite different aims. It also means that Frank is correct in saying that interpretation is an art and not a metho dologically controlled process. But Frank seems to be convinced that he must fend off the scientific approach because it reduces language to the code model and fails to account for individual meaning. This is at best misleading. There is always much in a text that a code model cannot deal with. But contemporary linguistics and new developments in discourse analysis within cognitive psychology have long left the code model behind. While none of these approaches can as yet claim to give a complete and satisfactory explanation of how text comprehension works in every detail, they certainly cannot be dismissed as scientistic and unable, in principle, to account for non-coded meanings. There is simply no good reason to</page><page sequence="19">DISCUSSION 201 assume that the production and comprehension of linguistic expressions, even those that are dependent, as they usually are, on various contextual factors, are beyond systematic analysis. Such analysis and explanation cannot and should not replace interpretation. But it can show us what exactly happens when people interpret texts and, importantly, what kind of truth claims interpr?tions can make. For once it has become clear that it is possible to make sense of a text in a number of different ways by bringing different sense-making strategies and bodies of knowledge to bear on it and that it would be wrong to treat textual meanings as if they were real, mind-independent objects about which we can be empirically right or wrong, the epistemological status of interpretations must be reassessed. To a large extent they are to be taken as recommendations to treat texts in certain ways rather than true or false statements about an object called text.40 Frank, it seems, is not aware of the true nature of linguistics as a science. He seeks to save the subject from the anti-humanist onslaught of decon struction - and I believe that his critique of Derrida in this respect is important and well-supported by philosophical argument. But when it comes to what he sees as the scientism of linguistic theory, he caricatures and simplifies its aims and achievements, again because he thinks that linguistics is ignoring the individuality of the subject and its semantic creativity. It seems to me that Frank's critique exemplifies a widespread misconception about science in general and linguistics in particular among German scholars within the humanities. It is an attitude that needs to be overcome in the interest of both the humanities and the sciences. NOTES 1 See for example the relevant chapters in J. Habermas, Der philosophische Diskurs der Moderne (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1985) and Axel Honneth, Kritik der Macht (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1985). 2 The most thorough and sustained analysis of French post-structuralism can be found in his book Was ist Neostrukturalismus? (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1983). Further analyses of Lacan and Derrida form part of his earlier book Das Sagbare und das Unsagbare (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1980) and are central to a number of his essays. Frank has addressed the relevance of analytic philosophy of language to hermeneutics in the previously mentioned books as well as in Die Unhintergehbarkeit von Individualit?t (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1986). 3 See for example his book Die Unhintergehbarkeit von Individualit?t. 4 J. J. Katz, for example, is a linguist who has changed from his previous naturalistic orientation to an anti-naturalist form of Platonism. See his Language and Other Abstract Objects (Totowa, N. J.: Rowman and Littlefield, 1981). But see also Chomsky's critique of Katz in his book Knowledge of Language. Its Nature, Origin, and Use (New York: Praeger, 1986), pp. 47, 49, 50. 5 See Chomsky's trenchant critique of the attempts by many philosophers to treat languages as formal objects ('E-languages') and to accept any grammar as valid which generates all and only well-formed strings of signs, regardless of whether the rules and principles underlying such grammars correctly describe human linguistic competence. See Chomsky, Knowledge of Language. From a somewhat different angle, Ruth Millikan has accused philosophers of lan guage of still believing in what she calls 'meaning rationalism', i.e. the idea that meanings are objects open to some form of intellectual intuition. See her book Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories: New Foundations for Realism (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1984).</page><page sequence="20">202 DISCUSSION 6 In this paper I don't wish to address the question of whether Frank's interpretation of Schleiermacher is more justified than that of others. My concern is with the validity of Frank's own conception of a philosophical hermeneutics. 7 H.-G. Gadamer, Wahrheit und Methode (T?bingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1960), p. 250. Frank by no means accepts Gadamer's Heideggerian view that the subject is delivered over to language and tradition, but he shares, at least to some extent, his view of the finiteness of the subject. 8 Thus the individual is given a similar status as that which Adorno called the 'non-identical'. Frank himself points out this analogy in his book Was ist Neostrukturalismus, (p. 567ff) and links it with the idea of hermeneutics as the attempt to save the individual from the onslaught of the 'apparatuses of power' (p. 569) which try to destroy the non-universal and the subjective. 9 See for example K.-O. Apel, Die Erkl?ren: Verstehen Kontroverse in transzendental-pragma tischer Sicht (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1979); Ansgar Beckermann, Gr?nde und Ursachen (Kron berg: Scriptor, 1977); Ulrich Pothast, Die Unzul?nglichkeit der Freiheitsbeweise (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1987). 10 See Frank, 'Die Grenzen der Beherrschbarkeit der Sprache', in Text und Interpretation, ed. by Philippe Forget (Munich: Fink, 1984), p. 183f. 11 See Frank, Die Unhintergehbarkeit von Individualit?t, pp. 88/89. 12 Frank discusses Schleiermacher's theory and its similarity to Kant's idea in Das individuelle Allgemeine, pp. 185-199. 13 In Die Unhintergehbarkeit von Individualit?t he accepts Derrida's radicalisation of Saussure's theory of the sign when he says: 'The meaning of sign a would thus be mediated by the relation of being-other-than signs b, c, d, e, f etc. Now there is no compelling reason to assume that the chain of signs that form the negatively related oppositional terms of the first sign is finite. Hence the limits of the semantic identity of a term are functions of an open system undergoing permanent differentiations forbidding any term ever to be present to itself) (p. 126, my translation, D.F.). 14 Cited in Das individuelle Allgemeine, Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1977, p. 201. 15 See ibid., p. 203. It must be admitted that only a few pages below Frank argues that individual meaning manifests itself in the peculiar combination of words ('im "Combina torischen" der Wortverkettung', p. 218), but contends, at the same time, that this 'combination' cannot be reduced to or identified with syntax. 16 Die Unhintergehbarkeit von Individualit?t, p. 128. 17 See 'Die Grenzen der Beherrschbarkeit von Sprache', p. 195-197. 18 Was ist Neostrukturalismus?, p. 293. 19 Ibid., p. 294. 20 Ibid., p. 317. 21 Jacques Derrida, Speech and Phenomena, trans, by David B. Allison (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), p. 64. 22 See Was ist Neostrukturalismus?, p. 470. 23 See Das Sagbare und das Unsagbare, p. 203. 24 In Das Sagbare und das Unsagbare Frank claims that Searle seems to be interested in the 'code' of language as an 'Ordnungsmacht', p. 164. 25 Was ist Neostrukturalismus?, p. 511. 26 Was ist Neostrukturalismus?, p. 509. 27 See Saul A. Kripke, Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1982). 28 Ibid., p. 517. 29 See his reply to Lutz Danneberg and Hans-Harald M?ller's essay 'Wissenschaftstheorie, Hermeneutik, Literaturwissenschaft.

Berlin and P. Kay's study Basic Color Terms (Berkeley: The University of California Press, 1969); a</page><page sequence="21">DISCUSSION 203 more general discussion which takes into account the more recent literature can be found in George LakofTs exciting book Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987). 31 As Michael Dummett has pointed out, a non-circular semantic theory must characterize our knowledge of language in a way that is non-propositional. (See his paper 'What Is a Theory of Meaning?', in S. Guttenplan (ed.), Mind and Language, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976). Thus we would have to say that the idea of an 'interpretation' of linguistic rules or the 'code' is untenable for two reasons. It leads to an infinite regress and it overlooks that the 'code' itself is something that needs no further knowledge of a code to be applicable to communication. 32 Similarly, the idea that the meaning of a word should comprise the whole history of the word in the language is an illusion erudite scholars in the humanities are prone to. It is also part of the anti-naturalism which conceives of meanings as independent of what is in the heads of real members of a speech community. This doesn't mean, of course, that poets with a good knowledge of the poetic and cultural tradition do not try to revive forgotten meanings. But this merely shows that knowledge about matters of fact are deeply involved in the comprehension of language. More about this below. 33 See his paper 'Literal Meaning', Erkenntnis 13 (1978), p. 207-224, and 'The Background of Meaning', in J. R. Searle, F. Kiefer, and M. Bierwisch (eds.), Speech Act Theory and Pragmatics (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1980), pp. 221-232. These ideas are further developed in his book Intentionality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983). 34 Dan Sperber, Rethinking Symbolism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975). Frank refers to Sperber in Das Sagbare und das Unsagbare, p. 173, Note 33; on page 227 of his book Das individuelle Allgemeine he quotes the following sentence from the German translation: 'Eine Vorstellung ist genau in dem Ma?e symbolisch, in dem sie nicht vollst?ndig erkl?rbar, d.h. bezeichnungsf?hig [also auch nicht mitteilbar] ist.' The addition in brackets, however, is misleading. Sperber is simply saying that a symbolic representation is not expressible 'by semantic means' as the English translation puts it. It doesn't mean at all that symbolism is like Frank's allegedly inexpressible individual meaning. What it does mean is that symbolism cannot be explained by an appeal to a semiotic code. The cognitive mechanism that allows symbolic meanings to be communicated is much more complex than a semiotic code. 35 Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson, Relevance (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1986). 36 I have analysed Culler's approach and the extent to which he misunderstood his own project in may paper 'From Structuralism to Post-Structuralism: Was the Structuralist Project Beyond Redemption?', in Poetics 18 (1989). But there is no doubt that Culler originally meant his project to be a systematic explanation of why literary texts are understood the way they are. Literary competence was conceived of as the set of rules and conventions guiding the reading of literary texts. 37 See for example Teun A. van Dijk and W. Kintsch, Strategies of Discourse Comprehension (New York: Academic Press, 1983). 38 The non-separability of semantic and encyclopedic knowledge in many areas of semantics is now accepted by numerous scholars in philosophy (e.g. H. Putnam) as well as linguistics. 39 I have addressed these issues in a number of articles over the last few years. See for example 'Understanding Poe's Tales. A Schema-Theoretic View', Poetics 11 (1982), 25-44, and 'Explaining Interpretation: The Case of Henry James's The Turn of the Screw\ Poetics Today 5 (1984), 79-95. 40 For a much more detailed analysis of these and related problems see my paper 'Can Meanings Be Objects of Knowledge', Poetics 12 (1983), 259-275.
