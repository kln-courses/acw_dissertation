<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Resignation  Todgers’s, somewhere adjacent  to the Monument Martin Chuzzlewit Surely there never was, in any other borough, city, or hamlet in the world,  such a singular sort of place as Todgers’s. And surely London, to judge from  that part of it which hemmed Todgers’s round, and hustled it, and crushed  it, and stuck its brick-and-mortar elbows into it, and kept the air from it,  and stood perpetually between it and the light, was worthy of Todgers’s, and  qualifi ed to be on terms of close relationship and alliance with hundreds and  thousands of the odd family to which Todgers’s belonged.  You couldn’t walk about in Todgers’s neighbourhood, as you could in any  other neighbourhood. You groped your way for an hour through lanes and  bye-ways, and court-yards and passages; and never once emerged upon any- thing that might be reasonably called a street. A kind of resigned distraction  came over the stranger as he trod those devious mazes, and, giving himself  up for lost, went in and out and round about, and quietly turned back again  when he came to a dead wall or was stopped by an iron railing, and felt that  the means of escape might possibly present themselves in their own good  time, but that to anticipate them was hopeless. Instances were known of  people who, being asked to dine at Todgers’s, had travelled round and round  it for a weary time, with its very chimney-pots in view; and fi nding it, at last,  impossible of attainment, had gone home again with a gentle melancholy on  their spirits, tranquil and uncomplaining. Nobody had ever found Todgers’s  on a verbal direction, though given within a single minute’s walk of it.  Cautious emigrants from Scotland or the North of England had been known  to reach it safely by impressing a charity-boy, town-bred, and bringing him  along with him; or by clinging tenaciously to the postman; but these were rare  exceptions, and only went to prove the rule that Todgers’s was in a labyrinth,  whereof the mystery was known but to a chosen few.  Several fruit-brokers had their marts near Todgers’s; and one of the fi rst  impressions wrought upon the stranger’s senses was of oranges—of damaged  oranges with blue and green bruises on them, festering in boxes, or mould- ering away in cellars. All day long, a stream of porters from the wharves  beside the river, each bearing on his back a bursting chest of oranges, poured  slowly through the narrow passages; while underneath the archway by the  public-house, the knots of those who rested and regaled within, were piled  from morning until night. Strange solitary pumps were found near Todgers’s,  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   147 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="2">  148    Dickens’s London hiding themselves for the most part in blind alleys, and keeping company  with fi re-ladders. There were churches also by dozens, with many a ghostly  little churchyard, all overgrown with such straggling vegetation as springs up  spontaneously from damp, and graves, and rubbish. In some of these dingy  resting-places, which bore much the same analogy to green churchyards, as  the pots of earth for mignonette and wall-fl ower in the windows overlook- ing them, did to rustic gardens—there were trees; tall trees; still putting forth  their leaves in each succeeding year, with such a languishing remembrance  of their kind (so one might fancy, looking on their sickly boughs) as birds in  cages have in theirs. Here, paralysed old watchmen guarded the bodies of the  dead at night, year after year, until at last they joined that solemn brother- hood; and, saving that they slept below the ground a sounder sleep than even  they had ever known above it, and were shut up in another kind of box, their  condition can hardly be said to have undergone any material change when  they, in turn, were watched themselves.  Among the narrow thoroughfares at hand, there lingered, here and there,  an ancient doorway of carved oak, from which, of old, the sounds of revelry  and feasting often came; but now these mansions, only used for storehouses,  were dark and dull, and, being fi lled with wool, and cotton, and the like— such heavy merchandise as stifl es sound and stops the throat of echo—had  an air of palpable deadness about them which, added to their silence and  desertion, made them very grim. In like manner, there were gloomy court- yards in these parts, into which few but belated wayfarers ever strayed, and  where vast bags and packs of goods, upward or downward bound, were for  ever dangling between heaven and earth from lofty cranes. There were more  trucks near Todgers’s than you would suppose a whole city could ever need;  not active trucks, but a vagabond race, for ever lounging in the narrow lanes  before their masters’ doors and stopping up the pass; so that when a stray  hackney-coach or lumbering waggon came that way, they were the cause of  such an uproar as enlivened the whole neighbourhood, and made the very  bells in the next church-tower vibrate again. In the throats and maws of dark  no-thoroughfares near Todgers’s, individual wine-merchants and wholesale  dealers in grocery-ware had perfect little towns of their own; and, deep  among the very foundations of these buildings, the ground was undermined  and burrowed out into stables, where cart-horses, troubled by rats, might be  heard on a quiet Sunday rattling their halters, as disturbed spirits in tales of  haunted houses are said to clank their chains.  To tell of half the queer old taverns that had a drowsy and secret existence  near Todgers’s, would fi ll a goodly book; while a second volume no less capa- cious might be devoted to an account of the quaint old guests who frequented  their dimly-lighted parlours. These were, in general, ancient inhabitants of  that region; born, and bred there from boyhood; who had long since become  wheezy and asthmatical, and short of breath, except in the article of story- telling: in which respect they were still marvellously long-winded. These  gentry were much opposed to steam and all new-fangled ways, and held  ballooning to be sinful, and deplored the degeneracy of the times; which that  particular member of each little club who kept the keys of the nearest church,  professionally, always attributed to the prevalence of dissent and irreligion;  though the major part of the company inclined to the belief that virtue went  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   148 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="3"> Resignation    149 out with hair-powder, and that old England’s greatness had decayed amain  with barbers.  As to Todgers’s itself—speaking of it only as a house in that neighbour- hood, and making no reference to its merits as a commercial boarding  establishment—it was worthy to stand where it did. There was one staircase- window in it; at the side of the house, on the ground-fl oor; which tradition  said had not been opened for a hundred years at least, and which, abutting  on an always-dirty lane, was so begrimed and coated with a century’s mud,  that no pane of glass could possibly fall out, though all were cracked and  broken twenty times. But the grand mystery of Todgers’s was the cellarage,  approachable only by the little back door and a rusty grating: which cellarage  within the memory of man had no connexion with the house, but had always  been the freehold property of somebody else, and was reported to be full of  wealth: though in what shape—whether in silver, brass, or gold, or butts  of wine, or casks of gunpowder—was matter of profound uncertainty and  supreme indifference to Todgers’s, and all its inmates.  The top of the house was worthy of notice. There was a sort of terrace  on the roof, with posts and fragments of rotten lines, once intended to dry  clothes upon; and there were two or three tea-chests out there, full of earth,  with forgotten plants in them, like old walking-sticks, Whoever climbed to  this observatory, was stunned at fi rst from having knocked his head against  the little door in coming out; and after that, was for the moment choaked  from having looked, perforce, straight down the kitchen chimney; but these  two stages over, there were things to gaze at from the top of Todgers’s, well  worth your seeing too. For fi rst and foremost, if the day were bright, you  observed upon the house-tops, stretching far away, a long dark path: the  shadow of the Monument: and turning round, the tall original was close  beside you, with every hair erect upon his golden head, as if the doings of  the city frightened him. Then there were steeples, towers, belfreys, shining  vanes, and masts of ships: a very forest. Gables, housetops, garret-windows,  wilderness upon wilderness. Smoke and noise enough for all the world at  once.  After the fi rst glance, there were slight features in the midst of this crowd  of objects, which sprung out from the mass without any reason, as it were,  and took hold of the attention whether the spectator would or no. Thus, the  revolving chimney-pots on one great stack of buildings, seemed to be turning  gravely to each other every now and then, and whispering the result of their  separate observation of what was going on below. Others, of a crook-backed  shape, appeared to be maliciously holding themselves askew, that they might  shut the prospect out and baffl e Todgers’s. The man who was mending a  pen at an upper window over the way, became of paramount importance in  the scene, and made a blank in it, ridiculously disproportionate in its extent,  when he retired. The gambols of a piece of cloth upon the dyer’s pole had  far more interest for the moment than all the changing motion of the crowd.  Yet even while the looker-on felt angry with himself for this, and wondered  how it was, the tumult swelled into a roar; the host of objects seemed to  thicken and expand a hundredfold; and after gazing, round him, quite scared,  he turned to Todgers’s again, much more rapidly than he came out; and ten  to one he told M. Todgers’s afterwards that if he hadn’t done so, he would  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   149 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="4">  150    Dickens’s London certainly have come into the street by the shortest cut: that is to say, head- foremost. (MC 132–4) Resignation is an odd word, even when one recalls that it means, less  frequently today, the act of giving oneself over, of surrendering or suf- fering passively the force of another. From the Latin, meaning cancel- lation or unsealing, it signifi es the removal or subtraction of authority  and control. In essence, you give yourself over to the other. The subject  abandons the illusion of autonomy, mastery and anything amounting to  control. This is not least the case with regard to perspective. Classical  representation, aiming at mimetic fi delity and the fi ction of an objective  world separate from the self, places the viewing subject, the reading  subject, at the centre of its worldview. The subject has the world he or  she sees, over and against that seemingly controlling subjectivity. There  is no view save for the one I see, no interpretation so valid as mine. Yet  my perspective is merely a perception, a condition of my subjectivity  and my being situated in the world at a given angle, or oriented in a par- ticular direction. What takes place when that view becomes fragmented,  when there are competing claims for my attention and when there is  nothing on which my vision can fi x, my interpretation can command,  and to which it might give fi xed or purposeful meaning? What occurs  in the fi eld of vision to perception, when the world resists, when it chal- lenges? What takes place when there is more than one vision within any  view? In the face of such challenges, classical, ordered representation no  longer holds; falling apart, it reveals the differing facets, the heterogene- ous perspectives, the irreconcilable positions, which do not reconcile  themselves into a single image. As subject of that which is in fragments,  which engages in an act of affi rmative resistance by refusing to coalesce  before me, for me, I must resign myself, I must resign the self that would  separate the world from subjectivity, maintaining it in the fi ction of  objectivity. I must surrender myself, my self, to the other. In what might be read today and retrospectively as an unconscious –  how could it be otherwise? – anticipation of certain of the effects and  devices of impressionism and post-impressionism, the opening pages  of Chapter 8 of Martin Chuzzlewit posit such questions and problems  for the subject. Or rather, they posit the possibilities of subjective res- ignation, and offer the reader the chance to rethink the question of  narrative representation, which always puts into play the temporal and  spatial phenomena of difference and deferral implicit in any image, if  we read them carefully, and not think them merely a sustained passage  of ‘typical’ Dickensian description. If such anticipation troubles the  reader as retrospective anachrony on the part of the critic,27 one might  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   150 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="5"> Resignation    151 approach ‘what Dickens does’ (that is to say, what is put to play, and  what produces in a given reader certain responses, if the reader is open  to the other, which, here, is the singular instance of the experience of  the text) from the other ‘end’, historically speaking. Baudelaire observes  that Romanticism, in painting at least, ‘is precisely located neither in  the choice of subject nor in exact truth [this being, if you will, the ‘acci- dental’ of particular modes of presentation], but in a mode of feeling’;  and moreover, ‘Who says romanticism, says modern art – that is inti- macy, spirituality, color, aspiration towards the infi nite’ (1987, 222).  In its responses to, and experiences fi ltered through perception of, the  city, Dickens’s reading / writing of London aspires in its Romanticist  vision towards the modern; always mediated by sensuous modalities, as  befi ts an authentic unfolding of subjectivity’s orientation, situation and  determination, such reading bridges the Romantic and the modern. And  while not all those qualifi ers framing the idea of the modern necessarily  leap from the page in the passage on Todgers’s and its environs, not a  few are already to be found at work. A quite astounding passage, and perhaps one of the most sustained  passages presenting London in any of the novels or essays, this study of  place is as exhausting as it is exhaustive. It opens in abyssal fashion and  hems one in, enclosing the reader on all sides with its idiosyncrasies of  detail and observation. It is at once dizzying and claustrophobic, closely  worked and yet proscriptive of positive or stable defi nition, save that in  which affi rmation of perception resists mimetic convention or adequa- tion. In Dickens’s generation of the city, his memory and apperception  of London, these several paragraphs serve analogously as keystones and  keys, in a re-presentation that is also a projection of remembered percep- tion of the arche-textural and the founding of modern urban subjectivity  attendant on this. Thus, the city drifts in and out of our vision – and  with this motion, the viewer, the walker, the subject of the city, drifts  also – as a series of ‘phantasmagoria – now a landscape, now a room’,  as Benjamin puts it of Baudelaire’s Paris (SW3 40). ‘The modern is the  accent’ (SW3 40), that accent being a matter of reciprocity, inversion,  iterability and recursion in presentation, and what one is given to read of  the city is its ability to consume and overwhelm one, to lose the subject,  but without trauma, even as the subject resigns himself to the experi- ence, coming to refl ect on what the urban location already refl ects back  – a series and sequence of seemingly endless locations of enclosedness or  abyss. The opening of Chapter 8 thus forms itself as so many projections  of ‘the phantasmagoria of [a] “cultural history” ’ of urban modernity  and its relation to the subject (SW3 41). The presentation of Todgers’s tends from its outset, with its hyperbole  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   151 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="6">  152    Dickens’s London and negations, its intimacy and its intimations of enigmatic obscu- rity, to inculcate, in the winds and folds of its labyrinthine, not to say  abyssal detail, that sense of disorientation tending to vertigo for the  subject, that perhaps not so hypothetical stranger, who, though unable  to fi nd the way to Todgers’s from the street, fi nds himself on its roof,  overshadowed, quite literally, by the only nominally given location, the  Monument on Fish-Hill Street, to which the reader might go. That one  reference to ‘real’ London only serves in the general sense of disorienta- tion, to the extent that all else remains a projection of the imagination, a  perception of the city-rhizome, its concatenated phenomena impressing  the senses with an immediacy from all aspects, causing one to reside in  a kind of resigned distraction as much in the reading as in the subjec- tive experience, were such an experience possible. Thus it is that the  narrator can introduce the reader into the passages around Todgers’s  and, at the same time, open to our view the passages that inaugurate  the chapter, with the confi dent affi rmation – against which nothing  remains to be said – that surely there never was, in any other borough,  city or hamlet in the world, such a singular sort of place as Todgers’s.  Everything comes down to the name, which signals nothing so much as  a sense of self-possession, and with that, of being closed off from access  or comprehension. Singularity of place is all; it is a measure of Todgers’s  singularity that London itself takes its tone, as it were, from Todgers’s  affi rmed being. For, in a moment of reciprocity, which moves from the  specifi c to the general, proving singularity through the  immanence of  urban iterability, we read: And surely London, to judge from that part of it which hemmed Todger’s  round, and hustled it, and crushed it, and stuck its brick-and-mortar elbows  into it, and kept the air from it, and stood perpetually between it and the  light, was worthy of Todgers’s, and qualifi ed to be on terms of close relation- ship and alliance with hundreds and thousands of the odd family to which  Todgers’s belonged. Todgers’s being singular, it remains nevertheless in close relationship  with hundreds and thousands of buildings and dwelling places. Though  singular, Todgers’s belongs, kinship being signalled. In its belonging,  Todgers’s singularity is affi rmed. Though there are, as yet, no human  beings, that the house has a name, and this is given each time as a pos- sessive noun; this implies, if not ownership, then a given relationship  between the human and place. Place has meaning through the name. In  this, the structure is analogous with those other houses that surround it  and extend beyond it. More – and more uncannily, perhaps – than this,  though, is that the house, in having a name, not only takes on a par- ticular human aspect; but also it shares with those other houses, those  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   152 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="7"> Resignation    153 hundreds and thousands, with whom it is on terms of close  relationship  – and who are reciprocally on terms of close relationship and alli- ance with Todgers’s – certain anthropomorphic phenomena, already  foreshadowed in that allusion to London as a whole, which has brick- and-mortar elbows, and which hustles, crushes and intercedes between  Todgers’s and light and air. London defi nes Todgers’s; but Todgers’s,  we might risk, in this perception of relation, offers to us what Gaston  Bachelard terms a topoanalysis (1994, 8) of place by which meaning  comes to light. In short, Todgers’s is London. Surely: that refracting pair of confi dent  adverbs create the idea of place as if between two mirrors and their  abyssal refl ections. Not merely reciprocal refl ections, the adverbial affi r- mations cause place to fragment into its myriad details, and so disperse  across the capital in its entirety. Nowhere as such, utopian in one sense,  and at least nowhere that can be found, Todgers’s remains in its occlu- sion by virtue of a singularity that defi es absolute generalisation but  which, in turn, none the less makes available a kind of transcendental  idea of the city to the subject’s imagination, Todgers’s can no more be  ‘seen’ or ‘represented’ than can London as empirical entity. Instead, like  London, Todgers’s is available only as a series of sensory impressions,  perceptions, which one has to arrive at in a spirit of passive openness,  a kind of resigned distraction. Affi rmation, singularity and inexplicable  apperception open ‘the space of an [otherwise] inextricably convoluted  tangle of traits’ (Weber 1996, 27), if we are prepared to accept these  as the conditions of approaching Todgers’s. Less a place than an idea,  Todgers’s comes to be apprehended, if at all, only through the work  in re-presentation of the idea through its myriad traits, which in turn  serve as ‘countless intermediaries between reality and [those] symbols’  (Bachelard 1994, 11) by which we grasp the sense of reality that shapes  our impression. Asserted through negative defi nition is the indisputable singularity  of place, which, as we have argued, guarantees a generative iterability;  further negation proving singularity is given – ‘You couldn’t walk about  in Todgers’s neighbourhood, as you could in any other neighbour- hood.’ Such a combination of the singular and the negative arises as the  mode of urban perception and re-presentation in the text of Dickens  in response to the modernity of the capital, a response marked by the  historicity of the moment in its formation of its subject in the act of  reading / writing. The subject has made available to him a mode of  perception – the subject / place relationship analogous with that which  is put in play between the two adverbial affi rmations, and by extension  from this formal reciprocity the material relationship between ‘town and  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   153 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="8">  154    Dickens’s London Todgers’, as the title of Chapter 8 has it – that enables re-presentation in  an act (as in all the other enargia) of ‘exemplary originality’ (Kant 2007,  146; see also 136–7, 146–7). Kant’s phrase, ‘exemplary originality’, is  employed to defi ne artistic genius, which, for Kant, is the intuitive, that  is to say pre-cognitive ability to present or re-present materiality so as  to embody or produce the aesthetic expression of a concept. There is in  this process a ‘subjective purposiveness’ (146) in response to the world;  but purposiveness is what one is given to see, determined here in the  text of Dickens in the response that is the subject’s becoming-historical,  inasmuch as the moment as re-presentation – the now in the process  of becoming past – leaves ‘images comparable to those registered by a  light-sensitive plate’ (SW4 405). Thus, ‘genius’ does not then create ab nihilo but rather, in the rela- tion between being and world, being and the event of experience of that  world; genius invents, fi nding what is given by the other – hence the  trace of historicity in the re-presentation of the material – and shapes it  in an originary manner, as if seeing for the fi rst time, and giving in the  process to the trace of the past moment the ‘now of recognizability’ in  a ‘visionary gaze’ (SW4 316). All ‘aesthetic’ re-presentation bears the  trace of this historicity (it could not have taken place at any other time)  but also the memory of the subject who invents. As observed elsewhere,  London in all its modernity demands a response, an invention, on the  part of someone whose perception presents and re-presents to readers  to come the place, and the relation between subject and site, being and  event (the event of the experience of modernity and the shaping force  it imposes on subjective intuition). Apropos urban modernity and the  reader, the city’s subject that the proper name ‘Dickens’ engenders, on  whom the name calls, and who in turn responds in reading / writing  London as if for a fi rst time, is thus the name of this ‘exemplary origi- nality’. It is in the name of Dickens that the subject comes into being, a  subjectivity appropriate to its subject. Who, and where, though, is the subject in this particular passage?  There is – but again, where? – the ‘narrator’, that phantasmic projection,  the screen as well as the projection, but the projector also. However,  introduced into the second paragraph, initially as someone incapable  of or barred from action, is another subject: you, the one who couldn’t  walk, as you would in any other neighbourhood. Instead, ‘You groped  your way for an hour through lanes and bye-ways, and court-yards and  passages; and never once emerged upon anything that might be reason- ably called a street.’ You are recalled, even as the narrator imagines  you remembering. Less or more than a subject? What we read is the  impossibility of assigning a stable place to any ‘one’ subject; memory  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   154 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="9"> Resignation    155 of the subject re-presents the experience as a perception of ‘groping’, as  if unable to see clearly, if at all. It could hardly be otherwise here, for  Todgers’s is so hemmed in, we will recollect, that neither light nor air  can fi nd its way to this location. Thus far, few if any details are given;  there are the impressions of lanes, bye-ways, court-yards and passages,  and, of course, impressions must be for someone; there are those brick- and-mortar elbows, but little resembling direct or straightforward  mimetically or objectively faithful representation, merely an impression. No sooner have you, the memory of you, or your memory been apos- trophised, returned to the scene, recollected in the experience, than you  disappear, giving way to a stranger, whose mental condition subsumes  him: A kind of resigned distraction came over the stranger as he trod those devious  mazes, and, giving himself up for lost, went in and out and round about,  and quietly turned back again when he came to a dead wall or was stopped  by an iron railing, and felt that the means of escape might possibly present  themselves in their own good time, but that to anticipate them was hopeless. That fragmentation of image initiated in the opening paragraph, fi nding  its corollary in the displacements from within the instability of the  second person singular, becomes the principal aspect of the stranger’s  passive, confused sense of self and place, distraction being a condition  of being pulled apart or being pulled in different directions. The stranger  surrenders to the experience of being lost, to suffering the event in some- thing approaching a sublime reverie, as a condition that determines not  only the phenomena of the city but the experience of those phenomena,  and thus, indirectly, the apperception of London. The (admittedly naïve) question might be asked, how does the nar- rator know the experience of the stranger, or the emotion and percep- tion that are ‘yours’? The most immediate response must be that the  narrator, though a fi ctive projection of some subject, or otherwise the  manifestation, the ‘effect’, if you will, of some narrating subjectivity irre- ducible to any one person, has experienced London in the manner being  foregrounded, and responded in this way. Memory makes possible the  re-presentation of the perceptual encounter with the urban phenomena.  What returns here of the city is the result of ‘putting the imagination  into a play which is at once free and adapted to the understanding [of]  . . . determinate ideas [received as] sensations’, these being narrated, in  the re-presentation of memory from the ‘lasting impression’ (SW4 158)  effected in subjective experience. A self – the condition of modernity – is  performed as memory, as you and as stranger, estranged from selfhood  in the encounter with urban phenomena. It is only in this manner of  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   155 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="10">  156    Dickens’s London provisional re-presentation and its play that a true or authentic experi- ence of London’s modernity – and thus to unveil indirectly the historic- ity of the encounter – has the chance to be communicated. In this way,  the reader may, in turn, intuit the pleasure of an experience otherwise   anticipated as traumatic or baffl ing. As if to illustrate the truth of this, other people come into the picture,  as it were, serving indirectly as witnesses, their own experience being  evidence: Instances were known of people who, being asked to dine at Todgers’s, had  travelled round and round it for a weary time, with its very chimney-pots  in view; and fi nding it, at last, impossible of attainment, had gone home  again with a gentle melancholy on their spirits, tranquil and uncomplaining.  Nobody had ever found Todgers’s on a verbal direction, though given within  a single minute’s walk of it. Cautious emigrants from Scotland or the North  of England had been known to reach it safely by impressing a charity-boy,  town-bred, and bringing him along with him; or by clinging tenaciously to  the postman; but these were rare exceptions, and only went to prove the rule  that Todgers’s was in a labyrinth, whereof the mystery was known but to a  chosen few. The evidence amounts to a collective attestation regarding the diffi culty,  if not the impossibility of fi nding the location, but with that, equally,  a shared sense of ‘gentle melancholy’, and ‘tranquillity’ in defeat. The  lugubrious sense shared by those admitting of defeat is made all the more  comically poignant by virtue of apparent proximity to the seemingly  mythical location, given the greater frisson by virtue of the appearance  of the chimney-pots. This single architectural feature does nothing to  reassure, only serving in the general sense of frustration implicit here.  Nothing else is to be seen, but the sense gained by those defeated is of  a labyrinth, even though the idea of a labyrinth with chimneys is not a  little odd. The very architectural incommensurability between what is  seen and what is felt serves to construct an enigma in representation,  as well as being expressive of that hieratic topographical conundrum.  Those who do reach Todgers’s allegedly are the stuff of urban legend,  doxical knowledge affi rming that they had ‘been known to reach it’.  Such a statement is mere word of mouth, with nothing to support it. In  this way, the text comes to perform rather than describe the experience  and the attendant memory of the subject’s perception. For the narrative  ‘does not aim to convey an event per se, . . . [but to embed the event . . .  in order that this be passed on] as experience to’ the reader (SW4 316).  Given that information is not being communicated, save for knowledge  of the impossibility of ‘knowledge transference’ in the modish language  of Higher Education documents today, there is a comic inutility to  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   156 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="11"> Resignation    157 representation. However, something else takes place; inasmuch as there  is a performative aspect to be read, which is not simply concerned with  representation of experience so much as the translation of the experi- ence into the materiality of language, the text of Dickens may be read as  conveying what George Eliot describes in The Mill on the Floss as ‘the  “transferred life” of human sympathy and identifi cation’ (Eliot 1997,  634; Stewart 2010, 179). There is thus construed an immersive transfer- ence of feeling, from navigating the passages around Todgers’s, to navi- gating the (written) passages about Todgers’s. The memory of resigned  distraction, gentle melancholia and weariness becomes ours, during and  following the process of reading, as if the experience of the city’s phantas- magoric parade were ours. In reading, I become the subject, as Georges  Poulet puts it, ‘of thoughts other than my own’ (1969, 56), though whose  thoughts – and more signifi cantly, whose perceptions, whose intuitions,  whose feelings – these may be one is not quite sure, given the transfer- ence and transposition between ‘narrator’, the ‘stranger’ and ‘you’ (I?),  singular or plural. If ‘my consciousness behaves as though it were the  consciousness of another’ (1969, 56), that other’s consciousness is one  engendered by London in the early part of the nineteenth century, felt  as if for a fi rst time, returning with the haunting force of its modernity. Todgers’s is there – as an enigma, or shibboleth perhaps. If you know  how to navigate the area, no direction is necessary; you are a Londoner,  of the city, one of its subjects or initiates. If, on the other hand, you do  not know where Todgers’s lies, no amount of information will make  that plain to you. You do not belong, and cannot become part of this  area of London, or, by extension, any other. Todgers’s remains to be  read, but is there affi rming nevertheless its illegibility, its resistance to  any mode of epistemological or, for that matter, topographical tran- scription. Knowing where the Monument is will not save you. All that  you might receive, if you are ‘the stranger’ imagined as one of London’s  lost souls, is an impression: Several fruit-brokers had their marts near Todgers’s; and one of the fi rst  impressions wrought upon the stranger’s senses was of oranges—of damaged  oranges with blue and green bruises on them, festering in boxes, or moulder- ing away in cellars. All day long, a stream of porters from the wharves beside  the river, each bearing on his back a bursting chest of oranges, poured slowly  through the narrow passages; while underneath the archway by the public- house, the knots of those who rested and regaled within, were piled from  morning until night. Strange impression this, at once – seemingly – olfactory and visual, or  perhaps the phenomena belong to some synaesthetic or hallucinatory  condition; though whether that is the stranger’s or an effect produced in  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   157 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="12">  158    Dickens’s London the stranger by the city can hardly be decided, given that the impressions  are wrought upon the stranger’s senses. The perception of ‘festering’ and  ‘mouldering’ is an apperception, properly speaking, because the alleged  oranges, belonging to nothing other than sensory apprehension, are con- ceived of as being secreted away in cellars. The reality that accompanies  the impression is no less surreal to the already disturbed senses of the  stranger, for there passes before him an endless, slowly moving stream  – fi guratively, of course, a human tributary of pouring trade from the  river, bearing on its current ‘bursting chest[s]’ of oranges. In counter- point to this diurnal, iterable fl ow are those congestive gatherings, the  human knots. That we are implicated in sensory apperception with the intimacy  implied by the sense of rotting scent associated by damaged, overripe  fruit is clear enough – our consciousness desires to attribute particular  determinations; but the immediacy of experience is itself a determina- tion that is illusory because, as readers, we are no further forward than  the stranger. Apprehending all there is, or all that there appears to be,  yet there is nothing concrete, nothing that grounds. Even work and  rest take place, and come to pass as zones of the text and zones of the   location, forming the structure of perception. The ‘resigned distraction’ of the subject, causing, in turn, the simulta- neous condition and perception of ‘giving’ oneself ‘up for lost’, or ‘never  once emerg[ing into] anything that might be reasonably called a street’,  within a labyrinth – or, more accurately, the apprehension of the city  appearing to one as a labyrinth – are symptoms, it has to be stressed,  not of a distressing quality; this is not the representation of some exis- tential crisis. In our readerly perception of the stranger’s perceptions  – or the narrator’s hypothetical speculation of the stranger’s apprehen- sion perhaps being a result of the narrator’s own haunting memories;  let us not forget we are the folds of a labyrinth produced as a result of  the singular modality of presentation, in which this passage encloses  us – we fi nd ourselves suspended, within, and subject to, subjects of, a  stability of world that is also the experience of a suspended animation.  We are in a world we cannot fully comprehend, and yet everything there  is to apprehend is there, immediately. The various phenomena, those  which reveal and those which occlude, those which enlighten as well  as those which confuse, all are ‘conjoined to my vision only by the nil  value of appearing’ (Badiou 2009, 128–9). In this world, which is all the  world of the urban that there is, ‘the being-there’ of the impression of  festering or mouldering oranges has ‘ “nothing to do” ’, and thus gives  nothing to be seen, as Badiou has it, ‘with the being-there’ of chimney  pots, porters, court-yards, ‘strange solitary pumps’ or any of the other  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   158 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="13"> Resignation    159 observed details. There is, therefore, no trauma, no disjunction from  the world, because the question is one ‘of the nil value of a conjunction,  and not of a dislocation of the world’. To put this another way, the  determination of the passage to which one is led is not a crisis of or in  representation but, simply, the transcription – the reading / writing – of  one’s being a subject of the modern. The meaning just is the confl ation,  the constellation of unrelated appearances, to which one’s attention  becomes ‘situated’, to appropriate Badiou’s word, to, and by, phenom- enon after phenomenon. Simply put, this is how one reads and writes  London; there is nothing frightening, overwhelming, Gothic, traumatic  and so forth in the experience of the city as such, if one’s apprehension  is of a piece with the modernity of the urban, and its phenomenological  perception. Importantly – and this might serve to explain why the passage is of  such length – the text of Dickens constructs the modality of apprehen- sion and experience as if it were a fi rst time, as if one were coming to  terms with London. Being lost, becoming lost is a mode of Being in  itself, and resigning oneself to this one enters into a modernity that one  barely understands, but which one senses, and which determines one’s  relation as the subject moves through the world. It is, therefore, neces- sary that the passage begin with negation, in a movement of presenta- tion analogous with phenomenological reduction, in order to displace  the false colouring of interpretive comparison, and thereby re-presenting  the memory of the authentic event. From this, the reader, shadowing the  narrator, and subsequently the second-person fi gure addressed and the  ‘stranger’, moves without apparent purpose, without certainty of an  end or any knowable goal, and without making connections, as the  sustained scene, in which the furtherance of plot has no place, invents  London. The city becomes a text to be read, ‘a series of . . . images,  of ideas, which in their turn begin to exist’ (Poulet 1969, 54); and to  do so, not ‘in external space’ but ‘only’, as Georges Poulet asserts of  the experience of reading, in ‘my innermost self . . . dependent on my   consciousness’ (1969, 54–5). Though these are the perceptions, memories and the ‘thoughts of  another, . . . yet it is I who am their subject. The situation is even more  astonishing’ (Poulet 1969, 55) because I am perceiving, as the other  perceives, memories which have never been mine arriving as if for a  fi rst time. Thus, we move on, moving spectrally, as it were, through ‘a  congeries of mental objects in close rapport with my own consciousness’  (Poulet 1969, 55), a consciousness the doppelgänger of the narrator,  the you, the stranger. Reading for a sign, reading the phenomena of the  world, but not knowing how (yet) to navigate such a world in all its  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   159 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="14">  160    Dickens’s London strangeness, you, the stranger estranged in the act of reading, enclosed by  the signs and yet distanced from comprehension, are conscious of having  to take on a ‘humble role, content to record passively all that is going  [on] in me’ (Poulet 1969, 59). Thus, it is little wonder that ‘Strange soli- tary pumps were found near Todgers’s, hiding themselves for the most  part in blind alleys, and keeping company with fi re-ladders.’ While the  notion of an alley’s ‘blindness’ might be common enough, metaphori- cally, the anthropomorphised aspect of the pumps – having reclusive  personalities and the ability to ‘hide’, apparently of their own volition  – does not give itself to any normative or naturalising recuperation. The  subject is conscious of what is seen, but the perception, its modality  implicit in the ‘translation’ from world to word, maintains something  approaching uncanniness, albeit of a non-threatening kind. The prose  of Dickens’s London thus performs that urban site in its re-presentation  of an experience that has inscribed within it the memory of an initial  encounter. This is not a matter of style, or of style alone; for, were that  so, then, the ‘strangeness’ would be presupposed, the assumption resting  in the a priori determination of ‘some exterior model’ (Merleau-Ponty  1981, 59). Such presupposition, or at least the modality of representa- tion that employs presuppositions concerning a particular fashioning of  the world, might be seen to be at work in fi n de siècle representations  of London, with their reworked, overheated Gothic tropes. But London  in the text of Dickens is still modern, if not new exactly, and it is the  encounter with, and experience of, urban modernity that the memory  work of the Dickens text attempts to re-present and give to the reader to  experience. The world thus emerges, phenomenon by phenomenon, as  these are experienced, as if at what Merleau-Ponty describes, in talking  of the act of painting, as the ‘point of contact’ between the subject and  the world, ‘in the hollow . . . of perception, and as an exigency which  arises from that perception’ (1981, 59). This is the genius of Dickens’s  textual fashioning of London – that the reader experiences in him- or  herself a phantasmal encounter commensurate or analogous with the  experiential moment, as if the prose were the material of the world, to  stress this once more. It is all too much, or almost too much, and we have not yet begun to  reach the beginning of an ending to this passage from Chuzzlewit. From  such closeness of observation, the presentation of place opens, perhaps  unexpectedly, as the following one-and-a-half paragraphs show. What  they also indicate is that if subjectivity is always tied to place, as I have  argued, and if, moreover, place is not fi xed as a series of objects but is  protean according to the subjective response to the motions, rhythms  and energies of place as these come to be apprehended, then it follows  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   160 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="15"> Resignation    161 that subjectivity is also unstable, ‘neither thing nor substance but the  extremity of both particular and universal’ (Merleau-Ponty 1964a,  153); and it is this polarity and mutability that comes to be refl ected in,  mediated by, the ever-changing perception of ‘town and Todgers’– two  terms, as we have suggested, that signify relation, iterability and fl ux in  exchange, reciprocity and synecdoche or metonymic supplement: There were churches also by dozens, with many a ghostly little churchyard,  all overgrown with such straggling vegetation as springs up spontaneously  from damp, and graves, and rubbish. In some of these dingy resting-places,  which bore much the same analogy to green churchyards, as the pots of  earth for mignonette and wall-fl ower in the windows overlooking them, did  to rustic gardens—there were trees; tall trees; still putting forth their leaves  in each succeeding year, with such a languishing remembrance of their kind  (so one might fancy, looking on their sickly boughs) as birds in cages have  in theirs. Here, paralysed old watchmen guarded the bodies of the dead at  night, year after year, until at last they joined that solemn brotherhood; and,  saving that they slept below the ground a sounder sleep than even they had  ever known above it, and were shut up in another kind of box, their condition  can hardly be said to have undergone any material change when they, in turn,  were watched themselves.  Among the narrow thoroughfares at hand, there lingered, here and there,  an ancient doorway of carved oak, from which, of old, the sounds of revelry  and feasting often came; but now these mansions, only used for storehouses,  were dark and dull, and, being fi lled with wool, and cotton, and the like— such heavy merchandise as stifl es sound and stops the throat of echo—had  an air of palpable deadness about them which, added to their silence and  desertion, made them very grim. In like manner, there were gloomy court- yards in these parts, into which few but belated wayfarers ever strayed, and  where vast bags and packs of goods, upward or downward bound, were for  ever dangling between heaven and earth from lofty cranes. There were more  trucks near Todgers’s than you would suppose a whole city could ever need;  not active trucks, but a vagabond race, for ever lounging in the narrow lanes  before their masters’ doors and stopping up the pass; so that when a stray  hackney-coach or lumbering waggon came that way, they were the cause of  such an uproar as enlivened the whole neighbourhood, and made the very  bells in the next church-tower vibrate again. In the throats and maws of dark  no-thoroughfares near Todgers’s, individual wine-merchants and wholesale  dealers in grocery-ware had perfect little towns of their own; and, deep  among the very foundations of these buildings, the ground was undermined  and burrowed out into stables, where cart-horses, troubled by rats, might be  heard on a quiet Sunday rattling their halters, as disturbed spirits in tales of  haunted houses are said to clank their chains. Following those solitary pumps, a difference is to be noted inas- much as the narrator’s perspective broadens, as if a camera sought to  pull back, transforming the image into a more comprehensive urban  landscape. If ‘perception is always action’, then it is at this point that  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   161 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="16">  162    Dickens’s London perception and the action it describes ‘becomes praxis’, so that the  value of phenomena comes to reside in ‘their capacity for composing  all together, even in their intimate texture, a valid emblem of the world  with which we are confronted’ (Merleau-Ponty 1981, 64). The reader  must refocus, as Dickens maintains the movement away from classical  representation, knowing that spectacle has no place in introducing ‘the  allusive logic of world’ (Merleau-Ponty 1981, 65), if, by ‘world’, we  understand this to signify London, in all its modernity. The multiple  churches, with their churchyards and the mouldering vegetable over- growth; the anthropomorphised trees with their enfeebled memory; the  fi gures of the watchmen, who ‘guard the bodies of the dead at night’  until ‘they ‘join that noble brotherhood’, serve as so many examples  of the temporality of place: perception also takes in the historicity of  locus, as this is made manifest, albeit allusively, in decay and the intima- tion of the subject, placed in such a landscape, as both himself and as  a memento mori; ‘material change’ is the perceived condition of every- thing, and so the sign of the authenticity of the image, history ‘fl attened  out’ in the perceived scene (Merleau-Ponty 1981, 65). The temporal and  historical give to our reading a sense of ‘sublimated existence’, which is  ‘more true’ than ‘lived experience’ (Merleau-Ponty 1981, 66), because  of the access it gives to consciousness of one’s Being. For the moment,  there is no stranger at this point, no ‘you’ to whom the passage is explic- itly apostrophised. The reader is left with the immediacy of the ghostly  apperception, as if there were no mediation at work. Death, time, decay and ‘deadness’ maintain the tenor of the image  in the subsequent paragraph. Carved doors are synecdochic material  fragments of the past, signifying the past of architectural forms while  giving access to collective memory of past lives, haunted by sound, indi- rectly received by the silence of the present. Indeed, it is the presence of  the past in the present which helps defi ne the topos of Todgers’s as an  exemplary place of modernity; for the ‘presence of the past in a present  that supersedes it but still lays claim to it’ is, in this ‘reconciliation’, the  ‘essence of the modernity’ (Augé 1995, 75) as mapped by the polytem- poral traces that mark the surface of narrative presentation. Dickens  fi gures the cultural memory of place through memories of shadows,  wood and stone, human lives and their material dwelling places inter- twined and interanimated, much as the graveyards fi gure the living and  the dead, the not so recently alive and those soon to be dead living on  only through memory, perception and re-presentation. In the absence of  knowing how to navigate this corner of the city, the subject has opened  by place the possibility of refl ection and attestation. Such present as  there is appears in the form of merchandise. Juxtaposed to the revelry  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   162 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="17"> Resignation    163 and vivacity of those imagined pasts, which haunt the imagination, mer- chandise, singularised as cotton, has to be read as the none-too-subtle  fi gure of the modern world. It also stands as the material reminder, on the one hand, of slavery  and colonial enterprises, and, on the other hand, the capital on which  the modern is constructed, even as it serves a more murderous purpose,  shifting in parenthesis to present tense, ‘stif[ling] sound and stop[ping]  the throat of echo’. The world of Todgers’s has about it an air of ‘pal- pable deadness’, ‘silence and desertion’; the court-yards are ‘gloomy’,  the aspect ‘grim’, and the packs on their gibbets appear to fi gure  nothing so much, ‘dangling between heaven and earth’, as material sup- plements for the damned. This ‘Faustian image’, coupled with the sense  of historicity of place, the phenomena of gloom and death, the Ovidian  echo – itself a classical allusion fi nding its own echo in the fi gures of  labyrinth and maze, which serve as architectural forms of abyssal unde- cidability that ‘defi ne’ the area around Todgers’s – and the spectres of  revelry, collapses worlds and times. If this is modern London, it is also  a pre-modern place. Before the reader, one world emerges from within  the other, the two in intimate relation and the intervening centuries  erased in what might be called a temporal cathexis invested in the  double image. In the transposition between imagined revelry ‘of old’ and the quiet of  the present, the transformation of lively mansions into dull warehouses  and storage places, there is to be read something powerfully anachronis- tic at work, apropos historicity; possibly, this is the image of the modern  out of time with itself; or, modernity is defi nable provisionally through  the appearance of anachrony. Here, in surges, we read the re-presenta- tion of past moments, allusively indebted to particular symbolic tropes,  which fragment the present from within itself, and as the condition of its  presentation. Anachrony works here in Chuzzlewit to render ‘history- as-it-has-always-been-known’ in ruins (Kates 2008, 203). As a result,  every subjective experience and perception of the present, the presence  of a present moment in relation to a particular site, ‘becomes internally  fragmented . . . even as each [site or event] ceases to be linked in any  necessary or causal way to the other moments putatively surrounding it’.  Thus, every ‘present, every moment . . . is radically singular and unique’,  history, as a result, becoming ‘located [albeit indirectly] in these other- wise dispersed moments’ (Kates 2008, 203). The historicity of the pas- sages and their traces becomes marked by, and offers a countersignature  to, that double force of closure and opening, history being ‘closed up in  each present, even as this moment never closes upon itself’ (Kates 2008,  203), due to that mediation on the part of an explicitly modern, urban  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   163 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="18">  164    Dickens’s London sensibility, and transmitted from the narrator in this openness of experi- ence as if for a fi rst time, to the reader. Furthermore, sound is cognate  with the visionary and imagination here, serving in the consciousness of  the reader to prompt the imagined aural signal, as the traces of the past  are conjured through what can be heard or imagined as having been  heard where now there is only silence. Horses troubled by rats in the cel- larage are suggestive, sonically, of haunted houses, the purpose of aural  stimulation being to offer counterpoint and spur to the imaginary juxta- position of different imagined temporal moments. In this, there appears  an ‘understanding of forms’, in which one might sense an injunction  not to limit ‘itself merely to the recording of their objective aspects . . .  there is a “life of forms” perceptible not only in the historic develop- ment which they display from epoch to epoch, but within each single’  fi gure (Poulet 1969, 67), and ‘in the movement by which forms tend . . .  sometimes to stabilize and become static, and sometimes to change one  another’ (Poulet 1969, 67). What Poulet defi nes as the simultaneous  ‘contradictory forces . . . the will to stability and the protean impulse’  (1969, 67) is fully at play in Dickens’s fi gures of the urban experience  and the interaction between subject and place, through the mediation  of the subject’s perception of what haunts and resonates in place, to  displace the present through the trace of the past, with what remains,  what persists, and what comes to pass. In this, the rhetoric of the subjec- tive reception and translation of urban modernity, the subject’s reading  / writing the city, we are enabled to perceive, in turn, ‘by their interplay  how much forms are dependent on . . . a shaping power which deter- mines them, replaces them and transcends them’ (Poulet 1969, 67).28 From that momentary double vision where the ‘throat of echo’ is  countersigned by the ‘the throats and maws of dark no-thoroughfares’,  a somewhat more benign, if still melancholic, world returns. So, yet  another motion is discerned. The world of Todgers’s contracts to  confi ne, and yet expands so that the subject’s place gives away to  another situation. Across the lengthy introduction to the location and  its reciprocal relation to the larger world of the city, so there is a process  in re-presentation of experience, whereby, on the one hand, determina- tion takes part in an infi nite expansion, while, on the other, there is  constantly what Coleridge calls a ‘force’ – and perhaps this might be  the appropriate trope to supplement the notion of narrator-as-subject  – striving to ‘apprehend or fi nd itself in this infi nity’ (Coleridge 1983,  297). The double principle replays itself spatially and temporally in a  series of becomings across the text of Dickens. I say becomings-plural,  for, if this is not yet apparent, there are multiple worlds (‘individual  wine-merchants and wholesale dealers in grocery-ware had perfect little  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   164 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="19"> Resignation    165 towns of their own’), temporally and spatially inhabiting the same place,  the same realisation or cognisance; the urban space produced in the  Dickensian imagination is, to borrow a singularly appropriate phrase  of Coleridge’s (in one of his more Kantian moments), ‘inexhaustibly   re-ebullient’ (1983, 300). From whence does this inexhaustibility, which nevertheless exhausts  the subject, leaving him or her in a condition of ennui, arise? If ‘to tell’  is to describe, to enumerate and represent; and if such an action would  ‘fi ll a goodly book’, while equally necessary would be a ‘second volume  no less capacious’ concerning the guests of the ‘queer old taverns’; then  the matter is one of generation, attestation, reading and writing. It is not  merely a matter of space, but of the interaction with space, and the rela- tion of subjectivity to this. Apprehending this, we have to see how space  is not just a neutral zone before us. The idea of space is an idea – that is  to say, space is a conception, given concrete form in narrative as place.  Space is a means to think the world architexturally, it is ‘the means  whereby the position of things becomes possible’, invested with that  power or force ‘enabling them to be connected’ (Merleau-Ponty 1962,  243). Narrative reveals a mode of refl ection on the part of the subject,  which causes the world to appear in a number of modalities, trans- lated through that process of anthropomorphisation and abstracted as  moods: resignation, melancholy, and so forth. To tell of half the queer old taverns that had a drowsy and secret existence  near Todgers’s, would fi ll a goodly book; while a second volume no less capa- cious might be devoted to an account of the quaint old guests who frequented  their dimly-lighted parlours. These were, in general, ancient inhabitants of  that region; born, and bred there from boyhood; who had long since become  wheezy and asthmatical, and short of breath, except in the article of story- telling: in which respect they were still marvellously long-winded. These  gentry were much opposed to steam and all new-fangled ways, and held  ballooning to be sinful, and deplored the degeneracy of the times; which that  particular member of each little club who kept the keys of the nearest church,  professionally, always attributed to the prevalence of dissent and irreligion;  though the major part of the company inclined to the belief that virtue went  out with hair-powder, and that old England’s greatness had decayed amain  with barbers. Here, the narrator appears to pause. The world and its forms promise  to overwhelm, and the only recourse is to admit, however indirectly,  the impossibility of representation faithfully rendered and, instead, to  imply, if not an endless reading / writing, one at least which, out of the  imagination, gestures towards an abyssal unfolding. Book upon book,  text within text: the dynamic of space considered as the interconnec- tion between mutable forms, opens to consciousness the promise of a  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   165 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="20">  166    Dickens’s London potential infi nity of narrative, remaining to be written but hinted at here  by the sketched tales of ‘opposition to steam’, ‘new-fangled ways’, the  sins of ‘ballooning’, the abandonment of ‘hair-powder’ as an essential  cosmetic of civilised society, produced in response to the ‘degeneracy of  the times’ by ‘old guests’, ‘ancient inhabitants’ and members of ‘each  little club’. Each narrative is a manifestation of memory, various pasts  so many revenant instances belonging to others, the city’s innumerable  subjects. The multiplicity of worlds is conjured by, and in turn conjures  and conjectures, equally, on the proliferation of story, and innumerable  inhabitants. With this understanding, the narrating consciousness opens  itself to the narration of countless others. The condition of the city is  such that there can be no single, controlling subjectivity, no simple, sole  position or perspective. As the vision of the urban location unfolds, so too do its many  traces call attention to themselves. The temporal opens from within the  present, even as the space of narrative, and the place it strives to fi gure,  expands all efforts towards offering greater detail and so the completion  of representation inaugurating a gesture towards infi nity and against  stability. As the narrator admits to the reception of other narrations,  other lives, other subjectivities – in this recognition, mimetic represen- tation is defeated, objective vision of the world made impossible – so,  here, we fi nd two fi gures for the act of reading and writing London.  On the one hand, the narrating machinery traces what it replicates, an  ineluctable proem to urban modernity and the concomitant fl uctuations  of subjective refl ection. The only authentic way that one can re-present  the city is to generate a double act of reading and writing in which the  subject is only ever a provisional fi gure, giving place to other subjectivi- ties, other times and other narratives. On the other hand, as a corollary,  any veridical apprehension or perception of, and response to, London  perceives how the self is always situated by the world and appears in  it and to him- or herself, as the world, as place appears. (On the situa- tion of Being, see Badiou [2009, 113–18].) What the opening of ‘town  and Todgers’ suggests is that Being does not have a world, as a stable  object to which subjectivity bears witness. Instead, the being appears in  a given place, or world, in its being situated by the given, singular locus.  In short, subjectivity is always situated, and the situation being always  more than one, so too is the urban subject. Yet, what marks the subjectivity of the narrator in relation to place  as singular, is that making exotic or strange the familiar, the otherwise  unremarkable, and to excavate from within this material archive the  historicity of place, without the programme to write a history of locale,  as if from the outside. Here, the text of Dickens presents London, from  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   166 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="21"> Resignation    167 the inside, with the perception of the ‘native’, the London subject. Such  a fi ction, a construct – and, it must be remembered, there is no such  thing, no such person as that which we call ‘narrator’, this being merely  the phantasmal projection, a situation of subjectivity in the text – is  motivated by what Walter Benjamin calls ‘journeys into the past’; as a  result of which, the ‘account of a city given by a native will always have  something in common with memoirs’ (SW2 262), which in turn narrate  rather than describe (to make a distinction of Benjamin’s). Even more,  such native narrative drive, for Benjamin, and this is certainly true in the  doxical orientation of a Dickens narrative, the narrator-effect functions  through what has been heard, the text becoming ‘an echo of the stories  the city has told him ever since he was a child’ (SW2 262). This produces  an ‘epic book through and through,’ generated from ‘a process of mem- orizing while strolling around’; ‘each street’, Benjamin concludes, ‘is a  vertiginous experience’, the city, ‘a mnemonic for the . . . walker’ (SW2  262). Nowhere is this felt to be more authentic than in those moments  where the past erupts from the pavements of London, as in the narrative  of Todgers’s. What engages the narrative effect above all is the idea of  London, and the condition of re-presenting that idea as an infi nite task  involving the labour of memory and fi guration. Such an idea, which  coincides with the Kantian notion of the Idea, is ‘an idea of infi nity’  (Kates 2008, 147). As such – this will explain much about the modalities  of the Dickensian architecture of re-presentation – ‘London’ can never  be presented directly or as such, in totality; it is only ever available to  that subjective experience indirectly, in every singular situation, for the  idea ‘can never be conceived as presenting its subject matter’ directly  (Kates 2008, 147). As ‘an idea of infi nity, the object at which this idea  aims necessarily overfl ows the consciousness of this idea’ (Kates 2008,  147), as a result of which one only grasps the subject’s apprehension of  London, if at all, in the frustration of representation, mapped here as the  inability to locate location. London is only known in its ‘nonappearance  and nonpresentation’ (Kates 2008, 147). Admitting the past, with its promise to return the multiplicities of  London, its memories, situations, subjects and tales, the narrator turns  back to ‘Todgers’s itself’, limiting for the moment presentation by  engaging to speak ‘of it only as a house in that neighbourhood’. Involved  in this turn of focus is an attempted delimitation of the image through  negation: ‘As to Todgers’s itself—speaking of it only as a house in that  neighbourhood, and making no reference to its merits as a commercial  boarding establishment—it was worthy to stand where it did.’ To say  that the sentence appears to say nothing would be to state the obvious.  The evaluation of worthiness seems grounded in the doxa of tradition,  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   167 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="22">  168    Dickens’s London which empasises the the inoperability of a staircase window, whether  regarding its being opened or being transparent: There was one staircase-window in it; at the side of the house, on the ground- fl oor; which tradition said had not been opened for a hundred years at least,  and which, abutting on an always-dirty lane, was so begrimed and coated  with a century’s mud, that no pane of glass could possibly fall out, though all  were cracked and broken twenty times. The window no longer functions as a window. Its uselessness is paired  with the ‘mystery’ of the cellarage, an enigma echoing that of the area  itself (‘the mystery was known but to a chosen few’), and of which no  one knows or cares anything. While narrative in the form of rumour  surrounds it, ‘indifference’ is the mood, the mode or affect directed  towards it. Moreover, it has nothing to do with Todgers’s, being the  property of another, apparently. The cellar’s most striking aspect is  that no one knows anything about it, or has any memory about its  purpose or precise ownership. The inutility, coupled with that pervasive  defeat of any positive knowledge, reiterates the epistemological negativ- ity, along with other denials or comparative dismissals (no sound, no  activity, nothing worthy of the name of street, no-thoroughfare), with  which the chapter had begun, and continued (‘Surely there never was  . . . You couldn’t walk about in Todgers’s neighbourhood, as you could  in any other neighbourhood . . . never once . . . Nobody had ever found  Todgers on a verbal direction’). We have moved around and around the  neighbourhood, without purpose or sense of direction, or being able  to orient ourselves. We have witnessed strangers, our epistemological  doppelgängers, equally lost, thwarted as to goal or destination. Yet, we,  you, the stranger fi nd ourselves at Todgers’s, the sense and knowledge  of which is equally purposeless. Indeed, given that we have arrived as  if by accident, without knowing how we got there, without being able  to observe how we made our way, Todgers’s appears before us as if it  were some mystical lodestone or keystone, centring and determining the  occluded identity of place. At the house, you are taken to the top, on to the roof. Clotheslines  no longer work, having rotted, and plants have been forgotten, their  withered condition transforming them. The promise of seeing anything  is almost immediately negated on arriving on the roof, the prospective  observer having been mildly concussed, then choked. If these trials are  survived, however, you fi nally have both a perspective – on the c ondition  of fi ne weather – and a point of orientation: there were things to gaze at from the top of Todgers’s, well worth your  seeing too. For fi rst and foremost, if the day were bright, you observed upon  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   168 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="23"> Resignation    169 the house-tops, stretching far away, a long dark path: the shadow of the  Monument: and turning round, the tall original was close beside you, with  every hair erect upon his golden head, as if the doings of the city frightened  him. Then there were steeples, towers, belfreys, shining vanes, and masts of  ships: a very forest. Gables, housetops, garret-windows, wilderness upon   wilderness. Smoke and noise enough for all the world at once. Below, in the streets nothing is to be seen clearly; clearly, nothing is  what is to be seen, on the roof, all one can do is list in the face of the  spectacle before the senses. The impression coalesces into the collective  metaphor of a forest, which, in turn, transforms into ‘wilderness upon  wilderness’, with smoke and noise, the assault on the senses virtually  complete, being ‘enough for all the world at once’. Before the iterable  leading to a loss of focus – the world blurs into an endlessness of similar  phenomena – optical, olfactory and aural senses are immersed, sub- sumed. More than representation, it is the subject’s perception, his or  her situation vis-à-vis the world, in the situation that is given the subject,  and which grounds subjectivity’s consciousness. Within the empirical  are the symbols of the subject’s being-there in the ‘world’ of nineteenth- century London. The novelty of the sensuous overload is such that it is  only indirectly apprehensible through the natural analogy. This is London as if for a fi rst time. In this, Dickens’s text medi- ates between classical and modern, in pictorial terms; for the passage  suspends the subject between the world and the subject’s senses. The  view from the roof is not merely about seeing London. It is concerned  with showing the reader how the subject sees London, if at all, at a  given moment. And in order to make the reader see and sense in a  manner appropriate to the modern urban subject’s genesis, so that  reading might have the chance to experience the memory of perception  touched by the truth of its historicity, the narrator-effect circumscribes  vision, constructing a ‘representation in which each thing ceases to call  the whole of vision to itself’ (Merleau-Ponty 1964a, 49), but works  to recall the subject’s situatedness. Everything in the phenomeno- logical fl ow tends towards a refl ection on subjectivity; concomitantly,  perception of ‘reality in itself and as it truly is’ (Henry 2008, 26) for  someone, whether you, I the narrator, the stranger, or whoever. It should not be forgotten that whatever the reality revealed, however  authentic the sense of that reality and the resonance of its material and  sensory experience, this is nevertheless mediated through re-presenta- tion, in a language of indirection tending towards the apprehension  of impression and image. That this involved formulation is forgotten  has tended to the assumption of the mimetic and objective, the merely  aesthetic on the one hand, and the semi-transparency of the medium  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   169 05/04/2012   08:14 </page> <page sequence="24">  170    Dickens’s London supposedly in the service of the historical, of context or whatever, as the  justifi cation for a critical reading, on the other. But the literary has as  much, if not more in common with painting and other visual arts than it  does with ‘history’, in the functions of its representations. If we do not  see the subject, neither do we see the city; hence the constant motion of  analogy, the rhythms of negation, and all those other devices of indirec- tion by which the passage in its detail and its entirety gives us to appre- hend. What the passage from the rooftop gives us to understand is that  we do not see the city, any more than we do a landscape; we see, instead,  through that circumscription already acknowledged, all that which  makes up a city; description forms a narrative surface, tending to the  interminable and the infi nite. The impression, the condition of appercep- tion – the subject feels the ‘whole’ of the city’s reality only through the  intimacy and density of detail – demonstrates indirectly that which, in  the text of Dickens concerning the modernity of the city and the subjec- tivity engendered, is always informed by the experience of the aporetic;  hence negation, doubt, hesitation, the expression of limit, the passive  suffering, the resignation. For re-presentation, we read, and learn from  the reading / writing of London in Dickens, in its endlessly aporetic  condition of ‘no-thoroughfare’, ‘encompasses the infi niteness of singu- lar difference, the infi niteness of reality’. There is, for the reader, as for  the subject, what Louis Marin calls a ‘loss in excess’, a ‘vertigo’ (Marin  2001, 249). Of such images, I may have to say, following Marin’s argu- ment, this is London, or ‘ “it is a city, a landscape” ’; but we are at least  able to conceptualise, from that which London gives to be read in the  mediated impression and experience of the text of Dickens, ‘the infi nite  difference of reality [‘you observed upon the house-tops, stretching far  away, a long dark path . . . steeples, towers, belfreys, shining vanes, and  masts of ships: a very forest. Gables, housetops, garret-windows, wilder- ness upon wilderness’] without ever being able to express or represent  it’ directly or in full (Marin 2001, 248). As subject, entering into and  resigning ourselves to a subjectivity not our own, neither ours nor of our  time, our perception is as of a ‘vertiginous experience: the eye loses itself  in the surface where representations of things defi nitively’ disappear in  the ‘words that designate and identify them’ (Marin 2001, 249). You arrive, therefore, at the conclusion of this extract, which begins,  ironically, with the observation that After the fi rst glance, there were slight features in the midst of this crowd  of objects, which sprung out from the mass without any reason, as it were,  and took hold of the attention whether the spectator would or no. Thus, the  revolving chimney-pots on one great stack of buildings, seemed to be turning  gravely to each other every now and then, and whispering the result of their  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   170 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="25"> Resignation    171 separate observation of what was going on below. Others, of a crook-backed  shape, appeared to be maliciously holding themselves askew, that they might  shut the prospect out and baffl e Todgers’s. Clearly, particular elements and objects determine what is to be noticed,  and how one is to see, with no volition on the part of the resigned  subject, whose gaze ‘fi nds itself prescribed’, the city’s potential impres- sion ‘pre-written’ (Marin 2001, 257) in the image of quasi-animate  architectural details. This strangely vital architecture speaks or remains  silent, it sees and communicates what it witnesses, or otherwise remains  silent. Then, you happen to have your eye drawn towards someone: The man who was mending a pen at an upper window over the way, became  of paramount importance in the scene, and made a blank in it, ridiculously  disproportionate in its extent, when he retired. The gambols of a piece of  cloth upon the dyer’s pole had far more interest for the moment than all the  changing motion of the crowd. Yet even while the looker-on felt angry with  himself for this, and wondered how it was, the tumult swelled into a roar;  the host of objects seemed to thicken and expand a hundredfold; and after  gazing, round him, quite scared, he turned to Todgers’s again, much more  rapidly than he came out; and ten to one he told M. Todgers’s afterwards  that if he hadn’t done so, he would certainly have come into the street by the  shortest cut: that is to say, head-foremost. Who might the man in the window be? Why has he paused in the middle  of writing? Is this no one in particular? Or might it be the artist in the  mind’s eye, placing himself in the fi eld of vision, not in a self-portrait  but, instead, in the manner of Velázquez, peering out from behind the  canvas, as he paints the painting in which you see him, Las Meninas.  This fi gure, appearing briefl y, then retires. You are reminded that, if  you see London, someone authorises that vision; becoming subjects of  the text, subject to the text and the fi gures of the city from which it is  composed, our perspective is positioned. You are invited to refl ect on the  perception of perspective, coming to consciousness refl ectively of your  having been situated. This moment is brief, however, the writer’s retreat  leaving a blank, as with a page remaining to be fi lled, or as a reminder  that there is no image without a subject. And with that disappearance,  the tumultuous phenomenal revenance visually and audibly of the mass  of the city returns, to disorient and intimidate. Too much uncontrollable  vision is awful, the fi gural vertiginousness threatening to become real,  the stranger, or you, transformed into the looker-on, quickly withdraw- ing from the scene. This is not just a question of falling from the roof. It  is also a question of resigning: from the perception itself, from its pres- entation, from living in memory through the experience of encountering  London. Infi nity is too much; the abyss cannot be comprehended. There  WOLFREYS PRINT.indd   171 04/04/2012   10:15 </page> <page sequence="26">  172    Dickens’s London ‘can be sensation only on condition that it exists for a central and unique  I’ (Merleau-Ponty 1962, 219). However, the event of modernity reveal- ing that there is no pure subjectivity but that the self is always situated,  the ‘refl ective I . . . [comes to fi nd that it] is not [pure] consciousness or  pure being’ (Merleau-Ponty 1962, 219); such an illusion is pre-modern.  The refl ective I, situated in resignation to the time and place of London  in the early nineteenth century, is ‘experience, in other words the com- munication of a fi nite subject with an opaque being from which it  emerges’ (Merleau-Ponty 1962, 219). London gives us to read a radical  subjectivity in Dickens’ reading / writing the city and its experience or  perception of the world, which is revealed ‘as an open totality the syn- thesis of which is inexhaustible’, and ‘indivisibly demolished and remade  by the course of time’ (Merleau-Ponty 1962, 219). Were I tempted to give a name to the mode of phenomenal production  and its situation of a subject signed by the historicity of its perception  that is on display in the text of Dickens, it might be apophatic hypotypo- sis: the vivid representation of scene or event, brought before the mind’s  eye as if I were subject in close proximity to the experience, but pro- duced through negation and indirection. Dickens gives us the possibility  to see truthfully through a textual mnemotechnic that creates perception  as if it were a new revelation. This is achieved through what might be  thought initially to be paradoxical. Eschewing the pretence of mimetic  transparency and yet offering the fi guration of all that is there, the text  of the city constructs and projects kaleidoscopic, fragmentary, iterable  and protean impressions of itself. It achieves this through ‘a refl exive  or presentative opacity’ (Marin 2001, 257) that is capable, if we resign  ourselves to a patient, attentive, resigned and exhausted reading not  driven by any purpose, goal, direction or teleologically desired meaning,  by ‘making the most of the representative transparency of descriptive  discourse [that is a roof, this is a door] through its opaque boundaries’  (Marin 2001, 257). We cannot fi nd Todgers’s because there is no map,  no overview. Todgers’s is not to be found, not because it does not exist  but because it is everywhere; and everywhere and nowhere, once again,  is where subjectivity fi nds itself when attempting to come to terms with  London, foolishly seeking an authoritative perspective, a controlling and  controllable point of view, rather than falling into the resignation of the  passive perception, that involves one more intimately.
