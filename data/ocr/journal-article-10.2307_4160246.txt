<plain_text><page sequence="1">360 THE WILSON BULLETIN September 1972 Vol. 84, No. 3 OWLS. THEIR NATURAL AND UNNATURAL HISTORY. By John Sparks and Tony Soper. Taplinger Publishing Co., New York, 1970: 6 X 8% in., 206 pp., col. frontispiece, 17 bl. and wh. pls., many pencil drawings. $5.95. This book is not a "scientific" product. It is disappointing when judged by such criteria as use of the relevant literature, evenness of coverage, accuracy, and absence of teleology and anthropomorphism. It is successful insofar as it provides some general knowledge of owls for laymen. The most pleasing features are the drawings and photo- graphs by Robert Gillmor, which add immensely to the attractiveness of the book. Throughout the book, the authors tend to digress from whatever is under discussion. This first is overdone to an irritating and distracting degree in Chapter 3, "Numbers of Owls", giving the impression that Sparks and Soper were becoming hard-pressed to pro- duce a whole book on owls. This chapter is a generalized, rambling discourse on predator-prey interactions, including cyclic population fluctuations and the concept of food chains. Chapter 4, "Owls and Man", is subject to the same criticism. Six pages are devoted to rehashing the problem of DDT and other toxic substances introduced by man into the environment. Owls are hardly mentioned. Errors and poor phraseology are not infrequent. For example, in Chapter 5 we are told that competition from bats and nightjars may have prevented owls from evolving insect- chasing techniques (p. 146), and that a bountiful food supply stimulated active speciation in rodents (p. 138). Chapter 6, the final chapter, "Owls-Their Unnatural History", is an attempt to gather together references to owls and folklore about them from a variety of sources including the Bible, Shakespeare, Chaucer, the Greeks, "Red Indians", and others. Some of the information presented is thought-provoking, e.g. "Hooting nearby could mean loss of virginity to a Welsh girl." Three short appendices conclude the book. In summary, "Owls" is a sometimes entertaining but superficial book. Readers should keep in mind that very little of the literature available on owls was utilized, and that as a result coverage is uneven and incomplete, and that inaccuracies are not rare.-J.
