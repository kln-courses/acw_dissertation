Tomb 1 contained the richest burial, in terms of both the variety and quality of the precious metal objects, ever scientifically excavated in the western hemi- sphere. Continuing excavations have demon- strated that Sipán was not just the site of a single majestic royal tomb, but a monument where many of the royalty of the Moche world were interred over time. To date, we have encountered twelve tombs that amplify our vision of the Moche social and political world. We now have a broader view of elite burial practices, which previously could only be conjectured from the painted representa- tions on Moche architecture and ceramics. The site of Sipán was named after a rural town in the Lambayeque Valley of northwest- ern Peru. The archaeological site consists of two large and eroded pyramidal structures of adobe (mud brick), and a third, lower and smaller, now known as the funerary platform (fig. i ). This rectangular platform was probably constructed in six phases, sometime between a.D. i and 300 (fig. 2; Meneses and Chero 1994). Each successive phase encapsulated the earlier constructions as the platform was enlarged. Although damaged by erosion and looting, the final structure resembles a long rectangular platform with a prominence located toward the center, where Tomb 1 was found. The principal tomb was in the center- west area, in the upper sector of the platform. The finding of the tomb was preceded by the discovery of a repository of offerings that included 1,137 ceramic vessels, among other objects. The twelve tombs that we have excavated in the funerary platform pertain to various eras and ruling hierarchies. The inventory and comparison of these tombs have allowed us to infer the role and function of each of the buried individuals. Investigations to date indi- cate that these elite tombs can be divided into four broad categories: ruling lords, priests, military leaders, and finally the second-rank assistants to military leaders and priests. The presence of different ornaments, weapons, and ritual objects in each of the funerary con- texts suggests the distinct social roles of the buried individuals. The funerary space itself also seems to have been delimited by social role. The tombs of individuals related to political or military power are primarily in the northern section of the funerary platform, using Tomb 1 as the central referent. Most individuals buried in the southern part, in contrast, had other func- tions, principally ritual. Tombs of the First Order: Lords and Priests The most complex tombs at Sipán are Tombs i, 2, and 3. The individual interred in Tomb 1 undoubtedly held considerable power in this north coast valley during the Moche reign, 223</page><page sequence="3">i .

Reconstruction of Tomb 1 at Sipán Painting by Percy Fiestas Photograph by Guillermo Hare and he was dubbed the Lord of Sipán in 1987, alluding to both the native toponym and his rank as an ethnic lord of the area. The indi- viduals buried in Tombs 2 and 3 are known as the Priest, and the Old Lord of Sipán, respec- tively. These tombs represent the highest rank of Moche culture, given the size and dis- position of the funerary spaces, in addition to the number of buried retainers, the quantity and quality of the funerary goods, and the materials used to produce the ornaments and emblems. Together, these features set these tombs apart from the others at Sipán. For example, Tomb 1 consists of a very complex funerary chamber with the primary lord sur- rounded by eight accompanying individuals (fig. 3). The inclusion of retainers is very re- stricted in the Moche world, and this number emphasizes the status of the upper hierarchy of Moche society. 224 ALVA Another important index giving informa- tion on social categories and roles within Moche culture is provided by the principal ornaments pertaining to rank that are typi- cally located with the remains of the indi- vidual. Finding information of this order, in its original context, provides a better idea of the relationships between the persons within the tombs and of the broader Moche sphere. In this preliminary study, I am concentrating on the most identifiable ornaments, specifi- cally articles found near or on the principal personages in the tombs. Thus, we can begin to understand more clearly the use of social, ritual, and military symbols of power. In our investigations, we have noted the impor- tance of certain details in the production of, and relationship between, ornaments. Several patterns have also emerged regarding the placement of ornaments in the tombs. For</page><page sequence="4">example, it appears to have been important to include three types of necklaces in the tombs. A certain symbolic duality was also mani- fested by bimetallic articles or pairs of orna- ments (one in gold and the other in silver).1 There is even some evidence that there were specific relationships between the number of objects and their component parts and the rank or role of the individual with whom they were found. We have documented a long-lasting tradition of paired necklaces with ten beads per necklace in the tombs of the lords, while the number nine or other odd numbers seem to be associated with the Priest in Tomb 2. Tomb i The funerary chamber of Tomb 1 measures approximately 5 m on each side and contains a coffin containing the primary lord; his alva 225</page><page sequence="5">4- Gilded copper banner from Tomb i, Sipán (height: 48.5cm! Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque Photograph by Carlos Rojas After excavating to the bottom of the cof- fin, we registered 451 objects buried above and beneath the skeletal remains of the lord. Here, I will briefly discuss a few of the most important ornaments from this tomb.2 The first critical elements were banners of gilded metal that may have been cult images (fig. 4). Found along the upper torso, these banners were made of small square metal plaques sewn onto a thick cotton cloth. Each of the banners has a central figure with extended arms, composed of metal plaques and larger retainers and other offerings surround it. The body was enveloped in a rich and varied col- lection of emblems, metallic vestments, and ornaments (fig. 3). The principal coffin was made of wooden planks bound with copper ties. According to osteological studies by John Verano (1997), the person in the coffin was probably a relatively tall male, between thirty-five and forty-five years of age. Three adult males, three adolescent females, one child, and one adult female accompanied him. 22 6 ALVA</page><page sequence="6">5 . Ear ornament with figure of a warrior, Tomb i (diameter: 9.4 cm) Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque Photograph by Susan Einstein (after Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 87) rendered in the characteristic manner of Moche leaders: wearing a headdress, holding weapons, and flanked by two personages in profile. Also near the body was a necklace of gold and silver beads in the form of peanuts, the largest of which measures approximately nine centimeters in length (Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 96). The complete necklace has twenty peanut representations on the two strands, and extended from shoulder to shoul- der. On the proper right half of the necklace, the peanuts were made of gold, while those on the left side were of silver. Over the ribcage were sixteen thick, slightly convex, gold disks integrated into another necklace (Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 97). Each disk has two perforations for fastening that exhibit embossed pieces, which dominates the com- position. These banners have a border of plaques with embossed paisley-shaped motifs thought to represent a plant form, and known in Moche studies as ulluchu. Later, in a sur- prising discovery of a similar banner in Tomb 3, we found the remains of an actual fruit encased within the embossed renderings.3 Under these banners was a metal orna- ment, composed of cut sheet gold, depicting an anthropomorphic silhouette, headless, with arms exaggeratedly outstretched and hands dramatically open (Alva and Donnan 1993b: figs. 64-67). In anatomical discordan- cy, probably symbolic, characteristics of the front and back of the hands are shown in the same view (that is, nails and palms together). At the center of this silhouette is a personage rendered in relief and similar to the depic- tions seen on the banners. We also found various pectorals composed of hundreds of shell beads. One particularly fine example is composed of red and white shell beads (some beads now appear green due to the oxidation of copper objects around the pectoral), organized in a radiating pattern (Alva and Donnan 1993b: figs. 70-74). Some spectacular ornaments were next to the body of the primary lord. At his head were three pairs of elaborate circular ear orna- ments made of gold and turquoise. One pair depicts a duck, while another shows a deer with antlers (Alva and Donnan 1993b: figs. 79-85). The most exquisite pair (fig. 5), carries the image of a small human figure, 6.

Among the ornaments we excavated was the first Moche gold and silver scepter un- covered in an archaeological context (fig. 6). The scepter is composed of a silver handle surmounted by an inverted pyramidal box made of sheet gold. The scepter could have also functioned as a sacrificial knife, as the handle terminates in a chisellike edge. The upper section of the scepter is ornamented with five panels of sheet metal sculpted in low relief. The top of the chamber depicts a warrior, splendidly dressed, and in the act of subjugating a conquered prisoner. The war- rior thrusts a war club toward the prisoner, who is nude and seated cross-legged, and is apparently restrained by a smaller individual behind him. The four sides of the chamber of the scepter are rendered in a similar fashion. These scenes shed light on the functional association of the object. The implication of the imagery is that the submission of prison- ers is part of the military and political com- mand of the individual who carried it. Another element known from Moche iconography and found in the tombs at Sipán is a crescent headdress ornament. Located be- neath the skeleton, it was made from a single gold sheet (Alva 1994: figs. 104, 106; Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 117). Headdresses with this sort of ornament are usually associated with individuals of the highest rank in Moche iconography. Next to the ornament were the remains of feather bundles attached to copper shafts, which may also have been used as headdress ornaments. Two other key royal ornaments, known as backflaps, one in silver and one in gold, were found below the skeleton (Alva and Donnan 1993b: figs. 120, 122, 123). Backflaps are thin sheets of metal, often decorated at the top in bas-relief and inlay, which terminate in a curved edge, generally replicating the form of a tumi (a knife with a curved-edged blade, typically used in ceremonies). Backflaps may have served as a type of body armor (see also the looted tomb, below). In Moche iconogra- phy, warriors are shown wearing backflaps behind them, suspended from their belts. These objects are unique to the Moche and apparently were used only by warriors of rank. Backflaps of the size and quality found in Tomb 1 have no parallel outside of Sipán. 228 ALVA The gold backflap is among the most spec- tacular objects in Tomb 1. The image on the top of the backflap depicts a supernatural anthropomorphic being, in frontal view, hold- ing a trophy head in one hand and a turni in the other. This figure is also known as the Decapitator, and is found on various rattles also found in the tomb. Beneath the backflaps, among other things, we found two more banners. In con- trast to the banners in the upper half of the coffin, these banners were found face down. At the bottom of the coffin were three minia- ture war clubs and shields of sheet copper, and various copper points, probably for nor- mal-sized spears. Finally, in the niches over benches along the walls were 212 simple, sculpted ceramic vessels. Tomb 2 The second tomb excavated at Sipán was located in the southern part of the funerary platform and was also constructed during its last architectural phase (fig. 2); Tombs 1 and 2 are probably from the same era. The funerary chamber, slightly smaller than that of Tomb i, measures approximately 4 m x 4m. As with Tomb i, it contained a coffin of wooden planks with bindings of copper straps. The buried individual was a man between thirty- five and forty-five years of age, shorter than the individual in Tomb 1 (Verano in Alva and Donnan 1993b: 153; Verano 1997). Around the remains of the principal occupant were five retainers, various animals, and offerings. In addition, a young man with both feet amputated was located over the roof of the chamber, suggesting that he served as a guardian. This tomb corresponds to an individual whom, by virtue of the characteristics of his garments and ornaments within the coffin, we have named the Priest, alluding to the Bird Priest represented in scenes known as the Sacrifice Ceremony (Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 143; Introduction to this volume, fig. 5). The most important difference between this burial and Tomb 1 is that the offerings are of lesser quality. The Priest's tomb included a headdress ornament made of gilded copper, representing an owl with wings extended (fig. 7). The body of the owl is in high relief, and the eyes were</page><page sequence="8">7. Gilded copper owl headdress from Tomb 2 (width: 59.5 cm) Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque Drawing by Alberto Gutiérrez inlaid with shell and turquoise. The feathers are made of dangling metal plaques that would have moved and shimmered in the light when worn. This elaborate headdress constituted the only headgear in the burial. The tomb also contained a backflap, the only defensive armament in the tomb, if in fact these backflaps were a sort of body armor (Alva 1994: fig. 153; Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 166). Made from two vertical halves, one of gold and the other of silver, the backflap has two perforations in its upper half allow- ing it to be suspended from a belt. The head- dress and the backflap are very similar to the owl headdress and backflaps worn frequently by the Bird Priest in Moche art. Even more congruent with this image, the individual in 8. Detail of beads from necklaces in Tomb 2. Beads are made of gilded copper with shell inlay (average height of beads: 5.8cm) Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque Photographs by Javier Ferrand Tomb 2 was buried with a copper goblet in his right hand. This goblet is similar to the upper portion of the tall cups also seen in the Sacri- fice Ceremony. The person in Tomb 2 wore two necklaces, each with nine gilded copper beads in the shape of human heads (Alva 1994: figs. 143- 144, 146-148; Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 163). The faces of the heads on one necklace are smiling, showing their white teeth of carved shell. The other necklace is made of head-shaped beads of the same metal and measurements, but the faces are frowning (fig. 8). Tomb 3 Tomb 3 was located in the center-east section of the platform, and pertains to the oldest construction phase of the funerary platform (fig. 2). Due to its earlier chronological posi- tion - perhaps some four or five generations before the Lord of Sipán in Tomb 1 - the indi- vidual interred here is often referred to as the Old Lord of Sipán. This tomb was much sim- pler and smaller (2.6 m in length and 1.7 m in width) and without a wooden coffin. The body was enveloped in reed mats and textiles and deposited with twenty-six ceramic ves- sels and copper objects, among other materi- als. This individual died between forty-five and fifty-five years of age (Verano in Alva and ALVA 229</page><page sequence="9">9- Gold spider bead necklace from Tomb 3 (average diameter of beads: 8.3cm) Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque Photograph by Ignacio Alva and the other an anthropomorphized crab with a crescent headdress (fig. 10). Both wear necklaces with beads in the shape of owl heads. Tomb 3 also contained two small scepters (Alva and Donnan 1993b: figs. 193- 195). One of silver, measuring 24.3 cm in height, has a finial depicting a male figure with a crescent headdress. Extending above the headdress is a rack extension from which representations of two human heads are sus- pended. The second scepter of gold measures 22.6 cm. Its finial is a spherical rattle. Tomb 3 also contained banners similar to those found in Tomb 1. Three banners were found above the body. Against a backdrop of gilded copper plaques, each has an anthropo- morphic figure with raised arms. Borders of embossed paisley-shaped ulluchu forms en- closed the figures. The figure on one banner was larger than the other two, and under the Donnan 1993b: 213). He was accompanied in the burial by a female attendant and a llama. One of the first ornaments we found was a gold necklace, whose ten beads represent spiders with human faces on their backs (fig. 9). The spiders are delicately fixed to a web of gold wires, which forms the front of the beads. One of the most admirable pieces of Sipán workmanship, each spider was made from six sections, with more than a hundred points of soldering. The back of each bead is a convex disk of sheet gold with an exquisite design of swirls and zoomorphic heads ren- dered in low relief. Among other notable items in the tomb were two gilded copper ornaments with shell inlays, perhaps originally attached to banners or headdresses. One represents an anthropo- morphized feline with a bicephalic serpent headdress (Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 204), 230 ALVA</page><page sequence="10">io.

Two more banners, of similar design, were found under the body, also facing downward, as they were in Tomb 1. Closer to the body were multiple groups of personal ornaments, such as pectorals, neck- laces, and ear and nose ornaments. Five neck- laces were found, each with ten beads in the shape of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic heads. Two were of gold and three were of silver. Evidently the spider necklace com- pletes a set of three bimetallic pairs. The most spectacular pectoral is composed of gilded copper volutes resembling the tenta- cles of an octopus (fig. 11). Over the face of the deceased was a lifesize burial mask, com- plete with a crescent-shaped nose ornament and a necklace of owl-head beads. The proper alva 231</page><page sequence="11">12. Nose ornament with figure of a warrior in silver, gold, and turquoise (height: ii cm) Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque Photograph by Carlos Rojas ornament was found in the upper half of the burial, while other body parts were found in various levels of the tomb. The backflaps, the necklace sets, the weapons, and the ceramic offerings highlight a close relationship between Tomb i and 3 . In some cases the scale is slightly different, as for example the gold backflaps. The necklaces occur in sets of three: three of gold and three silver that generally have ten units or beads each. Although the form and characteristics of this burial show fundamental differences from Tomb 1 - no coffin and fewer accompa- nying retainers - there still exists a set of ornaments, emblems, and goods that are simi- lar. The disposition of the funerary goods of the Old Lord are reminiscent of the Lord of Sipán in Tomb 1, inasmuch as the deceased serves as the central axis of the burial. The two tombs demonstrate the same general order of items, with the most personal orna- ments closest to the body. But more interest- ing is the idea that this order occurs not only over the body, but also beneath it. This sequence of ornaments and other goods, and their spatial orientation seem to have been right eye was inlaid with shell; the inlay for the left eye was absent. Perhaps the most interesting nose orna- ment is a silver plaque with a marvelous miniature effigy of a warrior sculpted in gold and turquoise (fig. 12). The warrior wears a large headdress in the shape of an owl with extended wings, and his own nose ornament, and carries a war club. The figure is similar to the representation of warriors on ear orna- ments from Tomb 1, but in this case, the owl headdress is distinct, and resembles the full- size headdress found in Tomb 2. As with Tomb 1, Tomb 3 had groups of backflaps and rattles, some with representa- tions of the Decapitator. In contrast to Tomb i, this tomb had ten rattles of gold and ten of silver, as well as ten backflaps in silver, ten in gilded copper, and one in gold. The backflap of gold measures slightly less than the back- flap of Tomb i (29 cm). Finally, as in Tomb 1, Tomb 3 had a group of weapons and spears, although many of the weapons seem to have been intentionally destroyed at the moment of interment. In addition, some emblems had likewise been dismantled before burial; for example, the head of a gilded copper feline 232 ALVA</page><page sequence="12">rigidly prescribed, and may allude to Moche beliefs and world views. For example, place- ment of the banners (those on top of the body are face up, while those beneath the body are face down) may suggest a division of concep- tual space, a division of the world above and the world below, split on the axis of the royal body. A pervasive sense of dualism is also inherent in the placement of ornaments and their materials (gold with the proper right side of the body, silver with the left). Most interestingly, it is clear that these symbols of power, rank, and identity endured for generations. The Looted Tomb One of the most important tombs at Sipán was partially looted prior to the beginning of our scientific excavations. We can, however, deduce that the same type of ornaments and emblems found in Tombs i and 3 would have also been found in the looted tomb.4 This 1 3 . Gold backflap recovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Philadelphia in 1998, believed to be from the looted tomb at Sipán (height: 68 cm) Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque Photograph by Ignacio Alva tomb would correspond to another lord of the same rank as the lords in Tombs 1 and 3. From the isolated pieces recovered by the police, and from knowledge of certain pieces that have ended up in private collections, it appears that the looted tomb of Sipán con- tained materials very similar to those orna- ments and emblems of Tomb 1. For example, the tomb probably contained a scepter of gold and silver with a representation of a warrior in low relief (Alva 1994: fig. 240) and a neck- lace of gold beads in the form of peanuts (Alva 1994: fig. 24s). Nevertheless, excavation of what remained of the tomb suggests that the interment of the individual in this tomb was in a format inter- mediate between the bundle of the Old Lord in Tomb 3 and the funerary chamber of the Lord of Sipán in Tomb 1 . In effect, the burial was not properly a coffin, but a set of wooden planks that enclosed a space. As one might imagine, the tomb was largely destroyed in the looting; we could only salvage evidence of some of the accompanying retainers of the principal occupant. To a limited degree, we have been able to identify a few items from this tomb that have entered the international art market. Among the pieces we have identi- fied as coming from this tomb is a backflap recovered by the Federal Bureau of Investiga- tion in Philadelphia in 1998 (fig. 13). Highly similar to those from Tombs 1 and 3, the gold backflap has the characteristic Decapitator on top, holding a tumi knife and a severed head. Burials of Second Rank: Assistants of Warriors and Priests We have located nine more tombs in the years since the discovery of Tombs 1, 2, and 3. 5 The inventory of subsequent tombs is less sump- tuous than the first three, suggesting that they pertain to individuals of a lesser rank, but still connected with the elite. These tombs date to various chronological phases, as defined by the architectural sequence (fig. 2). Tomb 5 Tomb 5 contained an individual who may have been a warrior of second rank (figs. 14, 15). The burial consisted of a funerary pit of ap- proximately 4 m2, located in the south-central alva 233</page><page sequence="13">14- View of Tomb 5 (shown head to top) 1 5 . Reconstruction of Tomb 5 Painting by Alberto Gutiérrez Tomb 7 This funerary chamber, pertaining to the third phase of architectural construction, was located on the northern side of the platform, an area subjected to looting and erosion. The chamber measured 3.5 m by 1.7 m (fig. 16). At its center were the burials of two adoles- cents, one female, and one male, originally laid out in reed coffins. Over them were offer- ings of llama heads and gourd-shaped vessels. The male wore armbands of shell beads, a copper disk, and a headdress. Two sections of a metal disk replaced the bones of the feet, absent as a result of a ritual amputation. sector of the platform. A number of ceramic vessels were found dispersed in the fill over the remains of a reed coffin. The coffin con- tained the bones of an adult male in an extended position, and oriented with the head to the south. The individual had various offerings, such as a copper mask, nose orna- ments, sheaths of combat weapons, a cres- cent headdress, ceramic pan pipes, thirty-two vessels and a singular wooden spear-thrower with shell and turquoise inlays. This burial probably pertained to an individual of the military elite, who perhaps also served as a musician, accompanying the lord and his entourage and playing the pan pipes. 234 ALVA</page><page sequence="14">Other metal pieces were found under the body. The female's burial contained a copper headdress with an embossed face, a shell-bead necklace, a rectangular plaque, and three ceramic vessels. The headdress was similar to those worn by the principal women who accompanied the lord in Tomb i and the Priest in Tomb 3 (Alva 1994: fig. 132; Alva and Donnan 1993b: figs. 132-13 3). The bodies of decapitated llamas and three ceramic bowls were dispersed between the reed coffins. 1 6. View of Tomb 7 Tomb 8 Tomb 8 consisted of a fairly large funerary chamber (6.2 m x 4.4 m in the upper half), indi- cating that tomb size and layout is not a faith- ful reflection of the rank of individuals, as this chamber (fig. 17) is larger than that of Tomb 1. In a general way, the form of the chamber is similar to Tomb 1, but it dates somewhat earlier in the architectural sequence, to Phase 3. The funerary chamber had five wall niches. Four burials were found in the chamber, of which two, located in the center in cane coffins, were clearly the principal occupants. They were surrounded by 124 ceramic vessels. The more elaborate of the two, on the west, was an adult male skeleton covered by four layers of ornaments and emblems. Among these were a headdress made of sheet metal, which has a central embossed anthromorphic face, with a large crescent extending above it, flanked by two mythological animals (fig. 18). This individual's grave goods included a series of weapons, suggesting that he fulfilled military functions. Shields, sections of pec- torals and war clubs, nose ornaments, spear points, and two remarkable metallic banners or cult images were part of his funerary as- semblage. One of these copper ornaments (fig. 19), represents an anthropomorphic creature with fins dominating a man. The skeleton of the second of the two principal individuals, located on the east, was found disarticulated. Evidently this indi- vidual had died earlier than his companion on the west side, and was removed from wher- ever he had originally been buried, and placed in position in this tomb. Care was taken, however, to place ornaments in the same order. His grave goods included a headdress with volutes, parts of other headdresses, a copper mask, a scepter, a war club, military emblems, and four ceramic vessels. One of the symbols of rank found with this buried individual is a scepter topped by a pyramidal boxlike chamber, similar in form to that found in Tomb 1 (fig. 20). As suggested above, these scepters appear to be linked with mili- tary command. This scepter, however, is of copper,- individuals of lesser status tend to have ornaments of copper and gilded copper rather than gold or silver. Two other burials, probably retainers, were located on the west- ern side of the chamber. alva 235</page><page sequence="15">17- View of Tomb 8 (shown head to top] 236 ALVA</page><page sequence="16">1 8.

The burial consisted of a funer- ary bundle placed in a pit measuring 2.05 m by 0.85 m. The skeleton of an adult male was covered by various layers of offerings and ornaments (fig. 21). This individual was also probably linked to military activities, judging by the inventory of his funerary goods. Among these were three copper crescent headdresses, a war club, a mask inlaid with shell, a ceramic vessel, a rectangular banner of gilded metal plates, four headdresses, a rattle, and two copper ear ornaments. Closer to the body itself were five war clubs and two shell pectorals. Two silver and gold rectangular nose ornaments were found over the face. Cleaned and restored, they show an exceptional artistic and techni- cal craftsmanship. 19.

Twenty-three ceramic vessels were in- cluded in the burial, and the stirrup-spout ves- sels among them correspond to the Moche III phase. Spear points, and other pieces yet to be identified, were also arranged around the indi- vidual. There were no human retainers accom- panying this burial; one llama was included. As in other tombs, many weapons were re- covered, especially wooden war clubs covered with sheet metal. The quantity of weapons in this tomb could indicate that they were tro- phies captured in ritual combat. This burial highlights the quantity of goods needed for a One of these nose ornaments (fig. 22) depicts two profile figures, a warrior with a crescent headdress on the left, facing a female figure with braids. The female figure is proba- bly a representation of the Priestess, a person- age seen in Moche iconography and linked with burials at San José de Moro (Castillo, this volume; Donnan and Castillo 1992, 1994). The other nose adornment (fig. 23) also repre- sents two personages, again face-to-face, but this time they are horizontal, as if floating. A tree with dangling fruits appears to emerge from their backs, and the root system extends below their bodies. Among the other orna- ments were necklaces, one of silver beads in the shape of anthropomorphic heads, another of beads in the shape of peanuts, and two unusual silver tubular pieces decorated in relief. The shaft of one of these tubular orna- ments (fig. 24) is rendered with a design based on an abstracted zoomorphic form repeated in diagonal bands, and the end of the ornament is an anthropomorphic face, sculpted in higher 238 ALVA 2 1 .

Tombs 10 , ii, 12 Located in the southern area of the funerary platform, Tombs 10 and 12, pertaining to the most recent architectural phase, contained ornaments and emblems clearly related to the religious cult. Tomb 10 is one of the few atypical burials at Sipán. It held an adolescent male of approximately twelve to fifteen years of age, oriented in a position opposite to that of the other burials, that is, with head to the north and the feet to the south. Among the few ornaments recovered were small metallic ornaments originally sewn onto a textile gar- ment and Spondylus valves. To the north was a llama skeleton, while to the south were 103 simple globular vessels. Wall niches in the small funerary chamber contained other vessels, camelid bones, and ten small ceramic masks, each approximately 5 cm in height. 23.

(length: 22 cm; maximum diameter: 3.6 cm) Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque Photograph by Ignacio Alva Tomb 12 consisted of a burial whose goods could be related to the religious cult (fig. 25). Together with the skeleton were rattles and sacrificial knives, typically indicating ritual functions. A number of vessels were located at the sides of the body, while near the cra- nium were two tubular silver pieces that could be ear ornaments. The individual was covered by copper platelets, which may originally have formed a pectoral. At his side was the skeleton of a retainer with the feet amputated. Tomb 1 1 was located on the north side of the platform, next to Tomb 8, and it was as- sociated with the third architectural phase. It is a funerary chamber with two burials in reed coffins (fig. 26). The principal individual, an adult male, had a number of ornaments: two copper headdresses; a pair of copper sandals; a hexagonal plaque; four sheets of copper in the shape of a "T"; three copper scepters,- two pieces of copper in the form of pallares or beans, twelve copper platelets sewn onto a thick textile; and much evidence of disinte- grating textiles. The accompanying retainer again lacked feet and was covered by four copper plaques. Given this evidence, it is possible to sug- gest that the burials at Sipán followed certain patterns, and individuals associated with spe- cific roles in life and perhaps death were interred in distinct areas of the funerary plat- form. Military chiefs or warriors were gener- ally buried toward the north side of the plat- form, while the burials of the priests and their assistants were located toward the south side, demonstrating the differential use of funerary space according to the social role of the individuals. 240 ALVA 25.

View of Tomb 1 1 Representations and Archaeological Correlations The funerary platform of Sipán included in- terments of individuals who were clearly the supreme political and religious authorities of their times. These individuals are identifiable through the ornaments, emblems of rank, and symbols of command that accompanied them in their graves. The items, and their contexts, provide us with an unprecedented oppor- tunity to draw comparisons between the archaeological record and the iconography found on ceramic vessels and other media known from the Moche world. By using both sources of data, we are able to form a more complete picture of Moche social hierarchy and ritual practice. The principal set of ear ornaments found with the Lord of Sipán in Tomb i may serve as a point of departure for this discussion (fig. 5). The individual portrayed on these ear spools seems to represent the primary indi- vidual of the tomb, who, like the image on the ornament, also appears in his military regalia, flanked by two warriors. The repre- sentation of a military procession known from a number of Moche ceramic vessels helps to illustrate the hierarchical order of the individuals buried at Sipán (fig. 27). In this scene, the individual presiding over the procession, the third figure from the left, wears a crescent headdress similar to the one found in Tomb 1 . The figure behind him, also wearing a headdress, but lacking the crescent ornament, may have an archaeological corre- late in the individual buried with his shield and war club, located on the proper right of the primary lord in Tomb 1. The individual following him carries a banner, reminiscent of those found in Tombs 1 and 3. Also present in the procession are four other individuals, one carrying a shield, one carrying a scepter and two carrying batons with what may be alva 241</page><page sequence="21">27- Roll-out drawing of a military procession painted on a ceramic vessel now in the Staatliches Museum für Völkerkunde, Munich (D.1410) After Kutscher 1983: Abb. 153A18. rattles dangling off the sides, surmounted by profile heads. The scepter is similar to that found in the looted tomb (Alva 1994: fig. 240; Alva and Donnan 1993b: fig. 153), while the heads could refer to certain metallic masks found in some of the tombs. The masks have perforations allowing for suspension, perhaps from a wooden staff or other support. Finally, pan pipe players are visible at both ends of the scene, recalling the individual in Tomb 5, who was interred with a such an instrument. The iconography found on ceramic vessels reinforces our identification of the types of ornaments considered crucial to rulership by the Moche. Time and again, types of items found in the tombs at Sipán are represented in the fine-line paintings on Moche vessels. Ornaments important to the ruling lord are seen in numerous themes in Moche art, such as the headdresses worn by individuals in a scene of ritual running (Kutscher 1983: Abb. 135). Here figures wear zoomorphic head- dresses with chevron designs. In Tomb 1, a cotton textile with metal ornaments was found that resembles this headdress. The overall shape is zoomorphic, and the body contains a similar chevron motif (Alva 1994: 74, dib.17). One of the shell pectorals from Tomb 1 has a triangle design, linking the individual buried with a personage known as the Radi- ant Being, seen in the Sacrifice Ceremony. Fine-line paintings on Moche ceramics give us a better idea of what the costumes and regalia would have looked like when com- plete, and in what sorts of contexts orna- ments would be worn. For example, garments embellished with metal platelets, such as the one found in Tomb i, can be related to indi- viduals seen in a number of scenes, including the Ribbon Dance (Hocquenghem 1987: fig. 242 ALVA 95; Kutscher 1983: fig. 152). In this depiction, only the most important individual wears a complete metallic tunic. Interestingly, he also wears a necklace of disks similar to one found in Tomb 1 . One of the ornaments we found in Tomb 3 was a fox head made of gilded copper. This small ornament (12.5 cm in length) was proba- bly part of a headdress, such as those seen in the painted scenes of combat and ritual hunts (Alva and Donnan 1993b: 184,- fig. 199). This type of headdress was also found in Tomb 8 and at other Moche sites, such as at Huaca de la Cruz in the Virú Valley, where Strong and Evans found one in the tomb of the Warrior Priest (Strong and Evans 1952: 154, pl. XVII, XXI, XXVI e-k). What is apparent from both the archaeology and the painted imagery is that there are items that are reserved for members of the highest echelon of the Moche elite, or governing rulers, and then there are items that may be used by the lower levels of the Moche elite. Whereas objects such as scepters and gold backflaps are exclusively for the rulers, fox headdresses may have been more widely used. Art and Power in Moche society In general terms the patterns and contents of the Sipán tombs establish a rigid hierarchy of social roles and functions among the Moche elite of the central Lambayeque Valley. The persistence of specific items of royal regalia over time, and the persistence of the proto- cols evident in their placement within tombs indicates the abiding character of these orna- ments of ritual and rulership, and their as- sociated beliefs. Some differences, however, are evident in the inventories of the lords7 funerary goods over time. There is an early</page><page sequence="22">preference for nose adornments, for example, and a later preference for ear ornaments and headgear. Some items, such as vestments adorned with metal platelets, seem to be a general characteristic for all Sipán elite burials, regardless of relative rank or role. Weapons, found in quantities and conditions suggesting they were combat trophies, were also extremely common among these burials. Yet within this rigid hierarchy, it is clear that important political changes were develop- ing over time. The evidence suggests that there was progression from a dual, balanced religious-military authority represented by the single figure of the Old Lord to a situation where there is a separation of roles and func- tions, evident in the tombs of the Lord of Sipán and the Priest. The burials of the priests and their assistants would indicate that they exercised largely religious functions, in con- trast to the supreme political and military functions of the Lord of Sipán. The Sipán tombs provide a remarkable array of evidence suggesting that much of the behavior depicted in the fine-line iconogra- phy on Moche ceramic vessels may indeed have occurred. The high degree of corre- spondence between the costumes and grave goods of these individuals and the elaborate narrative scenes depicted on vessels known from museum collections around the world implies that there was a visual and actual reiteration of key practices in Moche culture at the platform mound. Sipán contains graves of individuals who probably fulfilled the role of lord or priest, and were buried with the accouterments of these offices. The Sipán burial platform contained the remains of at least two individuals (Tomb i, 3, and proba- bly the looted tomb) who appear to have worn the regalia of a specific office, an office we know partially through depictions of the Sacrifice Ceremony on ceramic vessels. These lords may have presided over such cere- monies during their lives, aided perhaps by others such as the individual in Tomb 2, a man interred with regalia reminiscent of the Bird Priest of the Sacrifice Ceremony. Whether what we see at Sipán are the remains of a limited or specific series of actions, or whether the inhabitants of Sipán were ritually reenacting commonly under- stood practices known from mythological or theological teachings is a question that remains to be answered. The San José de Moro Priestess burials, which date hundreds of years later, however, suggest that this was a ritual practiced periodically in Moche his- tory, by numbers of individuals who donned the attire of their specific offices or roles to perform this ceremony and probably many others over the course of their lives (Alva and Donnan 1993b: 223-226). The Sipán findings provide an unprece- dented opportunity for the study of the high- est levels of Moche society, and for the analy- ses of the maintenance of political authority. The overwhelming emphasis on domination in Sipán imagery, through such depictions as the submission of prisoners on the scepter from Tomb 1, to the depiction of the deer on the ear ornaments in the same tomb,6 sug- gests that the display of such potential power was fundamental in the maintenance of political authority. We still do not know the extent of the realm of the lords of Sipán, and whether or not they dominated any regions beyond the Lambayeque Valley. Nor do we know precisely what their relationship was with the lords of other north coastal valleys, or to a centralized Moche state or states. For now, we propose an organization based on individual "lords" in each valley, whose eco- nomic management was based on irrigation and conditioned by the political units under a cultural pattern shared throughout the Moche world. The Sipán tombs have provided an unprecedented view of some of the spec- tacular tools and methods used by the Moche lords, as they presided over some of the most important events of their times. ALVA 243</page><page sequence="23">NOTES BIBLIOGRAPHY i. Gold objects were often found on the proper right side of the body, and silver objects on the proper left. According to early colonial-era documents, native people on the north coast believed in the duality and complimentari ty of the halves and of the sexes. Gold was associated with masculinity and the right side, silver with femininity and the left side (Alva and Donnan 1993b: 223). 2. A detailed description of the complete tomb inven- tory, as well as inventories of Tombs 2 and 3, can be found in Alva (1994) and Alva and Donnan (1993a, b).

Con- trary to what Henry Wassén has written (1987), this form may have nothing to do with papayas, nor with the use of anticoagulants. These fruits had different properties, perhaps tied to mortuary rituals, sacrifice, or combat. 4. In February 1987, a group of looters from the Sipán area broke into one of the richest undisturbed funerary chambers at the site. After removing and distributing a large part of the materials, one of the participants alerted the police, who solicited the aid of the Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque. We immediately organized an archaeo- logical salvage project with the goal of reconstructing all possible information on the context and contents of the looted tomb. We later extended the systematic excavations to other sectors of the pyramid, where the other remaining twelve tombs were discovered. 5 . In addition to the tombs discussed in this article, there are two tombs, 4 and 6, which are still in the process of being studied and will not be described here. Tomb 4 represents a complex series of inter- ments, including a re-opening of the grave during the last architectural phase of the platform. Tomb 6 has been located but has not been excavated. 6. The deer imagery appears to be related to themes seen on Moche painted vessels. Ritual deer hunts are analogous to the capture of warriors in battle (Alva and Donnan 1993b: 139,- Donnan 1982, 1997). 244 ALVA Alva, Walter 1988 Discovering the New World's Richest Unlooted Tomb.
