<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WINDOW IN THE SOAP BUBBLE AS ILLUSTRATION OF PSALM 26 BY CARLA GOTTLIEB Brigitte Lymant's brillant analysis of the soap bubble's iconography antedating Chardin et alia in the seventeenth century1, has brought to my attention yet another use of the window-in-the-globe motif I observed in Hans Memling's Christ with Musician Angels (ca. 1490, Antwerp), Joos van Cleve's Salvator Mundi (ca. 1512, Louvre), and a host of other sixteenth-century artists, mainly from the Low Countries and Germany2. The motif, an upright rectangle subdivided into quarters of light - the balcony rail in Joos is a later addition - goes back to the Master of Flémalle, who introduced it in the brooch of his Christ and the Virgin (ca. 1430-1435, Philadelphia Museum of Art) (fig. 1), and was probably transmitted by him to Rogier van der Weyden, who then may be the first to have placed it in a globe. I refer to Rogier's Christ between Mary andJohn the Evangelist, the center panel of the Braque triptych (1450/1500, Louvre), where the motif is poorly preserved3. The window motif is also found in religious paintings not connected with the Salvator Mundi, as well as in nonreligious works, and it is housed in different objects, for instance, a glass bottle in Still Life with Pharmaceutical Products, where it refers to Christ and Mary as Healers through two adjacent windows, each subdivided into three times three panes (attrib. to the German School, ca. 1470, formerly Mortimer Brandt collec Fig. 1 Master of Flémalle, Christ's brooch, detail from Christ and the Virgin.

Cologne, Schnütgen-Museum tion)4, or the eye in portraits by Dürer, where it may symbolize a window into the sitter's mind, whose character is summed up in the portrait's inscription5. Lymant's discussion centers on a stained-glass fragment, preserved in the Schnütgen-Museum, Cologne (M. 572), that shows two putti playing with soap bubbles in an interior, in front of a large window with a view on a landscape and fortress on a hill (fig. 2). A scroll inscribed Sic [transit]gloria mundi frames their heads, and the word pety «I beg», the beginning of verse 4 from the antiphon for Psalm 26, together with a few notes from its musical score, are placed next to their feet. In full this verse reads: «One thing I beg of the Lord, this will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. / That I may see the delight of the Lord and may visit his temple » (quoted from the Douay Version). Lymant has linked the unknown artist's style to Quentin Massys and Joos van Cleve, dated the fragment to ca. 1530, attributed it to Cologne, where several stained-glass factories were active at that time, and assigned it to a religious building. She placed the work in a series of pictures, whose religious content is clothed in allegoric-humanistic garb. She saw no relationship between the antiphon/Psalm and the image. . The relationship becomes evident if Psalm 26 is considered in its entirety, with verse 4 as the focal point. This verse prays for the privilege to dwell in the house of the Lord so that the «delight» voluptatem of the Lord is seen. But what is meant by voluptas? The Psalm's verse 8 explains that the author longs to see Christ's countenance: «My heart has said to thee: My face has sought thee: thy face, O lord, will I still seek». Because, based on 1 Cor. 13:12, Christian theology asserted that no 124</page><page sequence="3">human being ever had seen God in His full splendor, not even Moses, God can only be depicted either in anthropomorphic form, following Gen. 1:27, or in symbolic form. The stained-glass fragment does not use an anthropomorphic form, and many symbols for Christ developed during the centuries. Which one is used? Verse 1 of Psalm 26 narrows the search down to light. It reads: «The Lord is my light and my salvation». Light is one of the most common symbols for divinity, and Christ is often signified by it, yellow or white in color. It manifests itself in two ways: an emanation serving as identifying attribute of God (rays, aureole, halo), or a substitute for God, testifying to His presence (sun, ray[s], beam, lighted area, lightning). From these motifs, the artist selects the one linked by the Bible, exegeses, or theology to the event in Christ's life he wishes to depict, or the aspect of Christ he desires to emphasize. Psalm 26 does not refer to Christ's earthly existence but to His eternal being. Therefore the second form, the substitute symbol, is relevant. How Christ will be symbolized by light within the stained glass fragment depends on what aspect of Him the psalmist invokes. The author of Psalm 26 informs his audience of that also in verse 1. He is appealing to the Savior: «The Lord is my light and my salvation», he affirms. Christ the Savior is commonly symbolized in sixteenth-century northern art by a paranormal window, that is, a window without a foundation in reality - hence not a reflection - placed in an object. This mystical window functions as a triple reference to salvation. First, it shows the beholder «the door of the sheep [through which] if any man enter in, he shall be saved» (John 10:7,9); second, it reveals to him «the light of the world [that gives] the light of life» (ibid. 8:12); and third, it confronts him with the Cross, the mystic sign for the sacrifice that atoned for man's sins and permitted him «entering into the holies by the blood of Christ» (Heb. 10 :19). Usually this symbol functions as an attribute and is housed in the globe held by the Savior of the World, as in Joos van Cleve, but sometimes it is found also as a substitute for Christ, as in the Still Life with Pharmaceutical Products by the German School. In this picture, the windows are placed in a glass carafe (see above); in the Cologne picture, they are placed in soap bubbles. Five soap bubbles can be seen in the stained-glass fragment. The two next to the putto at the left (as viewed by the spectator) contain the window motif. The child is just completing the second bubble - it still sits on the holder - and his gaze is directed to it. As the motif of the window in the two bubbles has crosses dividing the opening in quarters, it cannot be a reflection of the crossless window in the room's rear. In analogy with other fifteenth- and sixteenth-century paranormal windows in globes, with those in the eyes of Dürer's sitters, and with that on the wall of the right pastophory in Jan van Eyck's Ghent Annunciation', they are symbols. This is confirmed by the meridians that divide the bubbles in segments, identifying them as globes. Soap bubbles have no meridians; globes do. The second child's soap bubble has already risen up in the air, following in the wake of two other bubbles. The bubble just released does not show the window motif: it has instead a large cross superposed on a large area of light. The symbolic meaning is, therefore, slightly changed: light, a reference to Christ, and the Cross, a reference to salvation, are shown; the door, a reference to entry, is missing. The bubble above it, in front of the round tower of the fortress, has the meridians; I cannot see a window. The highest bubble, touching the tower's top, has again both window and meridians. Yet, whereas in the left-side putto's soap bubbles the window stands out, strongly delineated, and the meridians are subdued, here the opposite is true. Whether these differentiations in the portrayal of the soap bubbles are intentional or the result of time, I do not know, and it does not affect the argument. The putti signify the presence of the Salvator Mundi, who is our light and our salvation, by means of the mystical window, disguised as a reflection, placed in a globe, disguised as a soap bubble. 125</page><page sequence="4">1 B.

When closed, the triptych shows on one wing a skull in a niche and on the other a cross. This iconography is obviously a reference to death and salvation through faith in the Cross. The victory over death through the Cross, promised in the closed triptych, is fulfilled when the wings are opened. Then the sun rising behind Christ and forming His halo is revealed, signifying the transfiguration of death on the Cross into eternal life - of the Crucifixion into the Resurrection and Second Coming. 4 Gottlieb, 1960 [note 2], pp. 323-324; fig. 11. 5 J.
