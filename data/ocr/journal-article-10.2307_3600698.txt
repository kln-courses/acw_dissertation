<plain_text><page sequence="1">COTTAGE CONVERSATIONS: POVERTY AND MANLY INDEPENDENCE IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND All that is requisite, is a warm comfortable plain room, for the poor inhabitants to eat their morsel in, an oven to bake their bread, a little receptacle for their small beer and provision, and two wholesome lodg- ing apartments, one for the man and his wife, and another for his children.' The mossy English cottage, celebrated today by the tourist and heritage industries as an object of natural beauty and part of national history, has less well-remembered origins in eighteenth- century attempts to understand poverty and reform the poor-relief system. This article seeks to recover that story and disentangle the cottage from an established critical enquiry concerned with representations of the English countryside. Although the cot- tage was a significant element in discussions of landscape and its 'improvement' - and although pastoral and picturesque aesthetics leaked into and often framed characterizations of cottage life - eighteenth-century observers mobilized other, very specific meanings of the cottage in debate about the condi- tion of the poor. These were meanings constituted through issues of wages and prices, work incentives, the sexual division of labour, population, and the politics of charity, social order and statutory poor relief. What emerge are the significant moral resources that the idea of the cottage offered political econo- mists, philanthropists, moral reformers, and others preoccupied with the labouring classes and signs of poverty. After all, why did a survey of rural poverty in 1837 ask: 'Are Flowers culti- vated round the Cottage?' and 'Do the Parents sleep in the same Room with the Children?'2 Between 1770 and 1820, a heterogeneous mix of traditionalists, reformers, improvers and political radicals considered the cottage.

Eighteenth-century cottage conver- sations dissect concepts of self-help and independence sub- sequently invoked by early twenty-first-century politicians and social reformers; they display the distinctive eighteenth-century social and sexual relations in which present-day fantasies of country cottages are grounded.3 I When late eighteenth-century commentators imagined the poor, the scene was often set in a cottage and its garden, some- times by way of an extended description, at other times in fragments and allusions. Miserable and 'shattered' dwellings indicated a neglected and sometimes vicious population; a neat and clean cottage promised a long and not always consistent list of social virtues. Dwellings of a particular type came to rep- resent a remedy for poverty. By comparison, early eighteenth- century commentaries neglected not just the cottage, but life indoors and most relationships among the poor: for observers and reformers, the cottage neither reflected the condition of the poor, nor offered a means for their improvement in terms of either profit or moral reconstitution. Throughout the century poor people (in the general eighteenth-century sense of those who had to work daily for their daily survival) certainly occu- pied small houses or parts of buildings: housing was a signi- ficant expense for married labourers and an important element in the experience of poverty. Eighteenth-century parishes built, owned and rented dwellings for the local poor.4 What were not constant during the period were the meanings and instrumental associations of cottages. I argue first that a variety of late eighteenth-century archi- tects, moralists, agricultural improvers and poor-law commen- tators, who all aspired to participate in national debate, identified and fashioned the characteristics of the cottage: there was nothing self-evident about it. Thomson (in 1727) and Gray (in 1751) had created influential cottage scenes in their poetry, 3 The phrase 'cottage conversations' comes from Joseph Jones, Cottage Conversa- tions: or, Good Advice to the Poor (London, 1821). 4 Frederick Morton Eden, The State of the Poor: or, An History of the Labouring Classes in England, from the Conquest to the Present Period, 3 vols.

Rev., xlviii (2000).</page><page sequence="3">COTTAGE CONVERSATIONS 71 but these did not cross from the literary genre of the pastoral into discussions of poor relief and economic improvement until the last third of the century. It was then that picturesque fashion and debate on enclosure shaped a distinctive quasi-sociological discourse on rural conditions, and poor-law commentators contributed an interest in lower-class motivation and feelings.5 Initially focused on agricultural labourers, this discussion broadened to address the problems of poverty in general. What is particularly interesting is the way the image of the cottage and its associations crossed demarcations that historians com- monly draw between liberals and traditionalists, moralists and radicals, professional men and landowners, Whigs and Tories. Second, I propose that interest in cottages organized ideas about sexual difference and that to a substantial extent this was done through a self-conscious exercise of the imagination. This indicates a complex late eighteenth-century process in which gender became a way to categorize the poor. It offered hope to those worried about the cost of relief and the dangers of dis- comfort and disaffection. Neither of my arguments here directly addresses the experience of poverty. Evidence, includ- ing fragments in material examined below, suggests that poor people wanted houses with some land attached - but not necessarily in fulfilment of the social objectives of architects, moralists or political economists - and that parish officials could implement rather different policies from those expressed in print.6 Although cottages have much to contribute to the history of poverty and debates about periodization,7 interest in lower-class 5James Thomson, The Seasons, ed.

However, these historians are not usually concerned with discussions about statutory relief and the poor in general. Research on allotments - the pro- vision of gardens and plots of land for the poor - comes closest to this study, but published work has little to say about the concept of the eighteenth-century cottage, its sexual politics and its relationship to earlier schemes to relieve poverty.12 Much more numerous are works of cultural and literary criticism. These explore the politics of landscape and 'improve- ment' to argue that artistic conventions were a complex ideo- logical response to far-reaching social and economic change.'3 John Barrell in particular has argued that late eighteenth-century 8 For example Enid Gaudie, Cruel Habitations: A History of Working-Class Hous- ing, 1780-1918 (London, 1974); Broad, 'Housing the Rural Poor'; Gillian Darley, Villages of Vision (London, 1975). 9 M.

When aesthetic regimes are of primary interest, and evidence is largely drawn from high culture, cottages are swept up into much broader and sometimes reductive characterizations of historical trends: metanarratives of economic revolution, polit- ical conflict or Victorian ideals. This has the effect of masking questions centred on poverty, displacing the poor to provide some historical background to issues of representation and genre. A lack of correspondence between research into poverty and work on the cultural landscape makes cottages, which span both, historiographically intriguing. So do later celebrations of cottage culture which replicated eighteenth-century assertions of patriotism and sturdiness.'7 But what made the cottage so? Mid eighteenth-century wars prompted patriotic outpourings and ambitious charitable schemes, but cottages, unlike hospi- tals, were not promoted as a key to national success, nor were houses - with or without small parcels of land - relevant when rising poor rates or immorality were at issue. As late as 1775, Jonas Hanway, a man at the forefront of philanthropic fashions, declared a scheme of cottage comforts to be against current trends.18 Since landowners and farmers rebuilt, relocated 14 John Barrell, The Dark Side of the Landscape: The Rural Poor in English Paint- ings, 1730-1840 (Cambridge, 1980), 19-23, 65-88, and The Birth of Pandora and the Division of Knowledge (Basingstoke, 1992), ch. 1.

Either they are invoked to give too much weight to the 1790s, overlooking evidence from earlier periods; or they are vulner- able to revisionist histories of economic change. Either they are yoked with an anachronistic eighteenth-century adherence to modern sentiments about family and domestic life; or they are presented in an unmediated relationship between material world and human perception. What I am interested in are the less tangible, mensurable factors - evidence of how contem- poraries understood the cottage, its poor inhabitants and their social relations - to explicate the politics of poverty rather than of landscape and aesthetics. In short, precisely what prob- lems did the poor cottage appear to address? Why (and for whom) were these resolutions intellectually or emotionally satisfying? 19 Christopher Clay, 'Landlords and Estate Management in England', in Joan Thirsk (ed.), The Agrarian History of England and Wales, v, 1640-1750 (Cambridge, 1985), 237. 20 Bermingham, Landscape and Ideology, 81-3. 21 John E.

Most of the material is drawn from pamphlets on the poor law, Board of Agriculture reports, architectural pattern books and works of social commentary and moral counsel. Unlike John Barrell's ground-breaking study of rural labourers, the present discus- sion does not focus on poetry and painting, nor on the fashion for ornamented cottages. The final sections will then consider the origins and implications of interest in lower-class housing, locating the cottage in a context of 'practical' proposals and social analysis that promoted independence and manliness to resolve a crisis of poverty. II What was a cottage? The term had both general meanings and specific associations - legal, geographical and social - tied to particular contexts. Broadly defined, it was a small, 'mean' house of one or more rooms built from mud, wood, stone, brick, thatch or tile by its inhabitants, a landlord or the parish.23 Throughout the eighteenth century, those living on commons or wastes occupied cottages; so did the rural and urban labour- ing poor, although in the latter case, the word 'house' was often synonymous. By the end of the eighteenth century, 'cottages' were more likely than before to be located outside town and be erected by a speculative builder.24 Through the many editions of his influential Justice of the Peace, Richard Burn defined the cottage as a 'little house for habitation, without any land belonging to it'. Until 1775, he also gave the more exact legal requirement that certain categories of new cottage should have four acres of land attached.25 Rarely executed, this piece of Elizabethan legislation was repealed in 1775 on the grounds that it prevented the industrious poor from getting houses and harmed the nation by lessening population. These arguments and an apparent slippage in definitions of what 'land' meant in 23 Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (London, 1819 edn), 171. 24Neeson, Commoners, 61-71; John Clayton, Friendly Advice to the Poor (Manchester, 1755), 22; Eden, State of the Poor, ii, 74, 141, 327; Barley, English Farmhouse and Cottage, 248. 25 Richard Bum, The Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer, 7th edn, 3 vols.

Jeanette Neeson has commented that the term 'cottager' has a 'late eighteenth- and early nineteenth- century ring to it. It has an enclosure commissioner's stamp on it', and other evidence confirms that concepts of cottage and cottager were in flux as particular legal, cultural and economic demands shaped and stretched their meanings.27 Thus, from the 1780s picturesque aesthetics generated interest in what was rugged, weathered, irregular and sequestered, and 'cot- tage' described any small building, especially a thatched one: a definition reinforced by artists and engravers.28 Debate on picturesque theory canvassed issues of landscape, cultivation, nature, travel, prospect and social connection and consolidated two rather different and not necessarily compatible versions of the cottage, both of which emphasized aesthetic values and conveyed a sense of pleasure: first, the dwelling of the labouring poor set in a framework of benevolence, hierarchy and estate management; and second, an embellished symbol of retirement and romantic love which flourished in the tourist's view as an idealized destination.29 Consequently, the cottage acquired socially specific characteristics and forms which extended upwards from the labouring poor and led James Malton, topo- graphical artist and proponent of the picturesque, to dispute any idea that the cottage was 'mean'.30 These more prosperous associations are evident in eighteenth- century fiction and architecture. From about 1780, cottages featured in an increasing number of publications, many of them novels. Most drew on pastoral traditions to describe rural retire- ment, a golden mean between poverty and riches.

Scenes of lower-class cottage life were highly repetitive. Well- ordered dwellings, when fully elaborated, were snug, sheltered, productive, clean and neat, their occupants cheerful, industri- ous, frugal, happy and contented, with defined social duties and rewards. They led simple, fecund and affectionate lives, respected their aged parents, had regular habits and simple manners, shunned poor relief and were socially attached to their country, social superiors and neighbours (in the latter case either assisting or policing one another according to an author's sympathies).35 Cottages, so promoters said, should be situated close to the man's work, away from pubs and other tempta- tions, and be designed with apartments suitable for knitting, spinning or other manufacturing processes.36 Edmund Bartell concluded his architectural work of 1804 with a typical contrast between wretched huts and clean and comfortable cottages. Men deprived of domestic happiness seek oblivion before the alehouse fire: 'how different must be his sensations, who at his return is greeted by his humble yet happy family; whose brows, crowned with content, are brightened by the cheerful emana- tions of the evening fire, and upon whose homely board is spread wholesome but frugal plenty!'37 Humble dignity and family affection before the hearth at the end of the working day recur in cottage descriptions. Hannah More deployed them to recommend reforming projects to women of moderate means: Mrs Jones in her evening walks had the pleasure to see many an honest man drinking his wholesome cup of beer by his own fireside, his rosy 34 Hugh Cunningham, The Children of the Poor: Representations of Childhood since the Seventeenth Century (Oxford, 1991), 60. 35 Kent, Hints to Gentlemen of Landed Property, 228-58; James Robertson, General View of the Agriculture in the Southern Districts of the County of Perth (London, 1794), 99-102; Hanway, Defects of Police, 171 (quoting from Robert Potter, Observations on the Poor Laws, on the Present State of the Poor, and on Houses of Industry (London, 1775)); J.

But no word is redundant in conveying the complex messages that are summed up, perhaps, in Bartell's final oxymoron 'frugal plenty', directed not to the labourer but, like much of this literature, to an intended reader- ship of gentlemen. The thriving cottage was contrasted, implicitly or explicitly, with 'shattered hovels which half the poor of this kingdom are obliged to put up with'.39 Hovels were open to the weather and caused agues and rheumatism. They were damp, smelly, untidy, dirty and disgusting; fluids soaked into the plain earth floor, and animals often shared accommodation.40 Even with- out animals, however, huts and hovels were overcrowded; inhabitants slept and even gave birth in a single room.41 Although such descriptions were often generalized or ventrilo- quized, Arthur Young, secretary to the Board of Agriculture, published specific examples as a dismal indictment of the effects of dispossession through enclosure and of current poor relief: a critique of social policy the Board declined to pub- lish.42 Visiting Waverley Abbey in 1800, Young noted a 'wretched, miserable hovel, much worse than any thing I have seen in the remotest parts of Ireland', and then wandered on to identify the worst case of the twenty-eight he recorded, that of John Binfield: He is in the workhouse; but his wife and two girls grown, one of them 23, at home ...

Through the absence or presence of key material indi- cators, the cottage and its ground were a sign to be read, evidence that commentators could use to infer the condition of the poor.44 Picturesque elements were evident to varying degrees, most markedly in those architectural accounts that presented cot- tages as archaic, organic, anthropomorphic actors in the rural economy. James Malton described a 'British' cottage 'en- vironed with smiling verdure, having a contented, chearful, inviting aspect, and door on the latch, ready to receive the gossip neighbour, or weary, exhausted traveller'.45 Bartell evoked a picturesque social landscape governed by beneficent landlords, not rapacious farmers, in which the poor could manifest an appropriate combination of self-sufficiency and social attachment.46 However, in characterizing the poor, the late eighteenth-century cottage scene was not restricted to a particular aesthetic fashion or political vision. It was applied to cottagers exercising common right on wastes, those living on estates, in towns or in manufacturing districts, and those who existed in corners, on roadside verges.47 Cottages also 43 Arthur Young, An Inquiry into the Propriety of Applying Wastes to the Better Maintenance and Support of the Poor (Bury, 1801), 100-1. 44Thomas Rudge, General View of the Agriculture of the County of Gloucester (London, 1807), 49, 196; John Farey, General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire, 3 vols.

By the early nineteenth century, and especially after 1815, cottages and allotments were proposed for agricultural labourers in general and, in the case of comfortable dwellings, for labourers in manu- facture.48 The cottage attracted legislative interest and had pro- ponents as far afield as the penal colony of New South Wales.49 Cottages were also used to support some diverse proposi- tions. Agricultural writers could not agree on how much land to attach to labourers' houses (room for a garden or for a cow?), nor on who was to provide the dwelling (should the poor build their own or rent, and from whom?).50 Commentators differed on questions of social authority and structure and so disputed the precise benefits of dwellings and how to achieve them. But strong language against particular types of cottage as 'ruinous speculation' should not conceal the degree of consensus about their potential value." Political economists, agronomists and poor-law reformers all used the cottage, though to promote contradictory purposes.

Ian Dyck argues that Whig and Tory contemporaries missed the subversive edge to William Cobbett's cottage dis- cussions, but such consensus also suggests how the cottage informed the imagination and framed thinking across a broad range of views.57 Polemicists, such as the political economist the Revd John Howlett, who criticized sentimental evocations of cottage life, were themselves susceptible to its appeal. Even when Howlett recommended enclosure while recognizing its immiserating effects, he countered support for commoners with two different characterizations of the cottage.58 One was a harsh yet bene- ficial environment for raising sturdy children capable of hard work.59 The other offered a rival scene of plenty, which in its 52Joseph Townsend, A Dissertation on the Poor Laws: By a Well-Wisher to Mankind (1786; Berkeley, 1971), 69. 53 [John Scott], Observations on the Present State of the Parochial and Vagrant Poor (London, 1773), 47-8. 54 Jeremy Bentham, Pauper Management Improved: Particularly by Means of an Application of the Panopticon Principle of Construction (London, 1812), 'Outline of a Work', 21, 218, 280-3. 55 David Davies, The Case of Labourers in Husbandry Stated and Considered in Three Parts (London, 1795); Robert Douglas, General View of the Agriculture in the Counties of Roxburgh and Selkirk (Edinburgh, 1798), 248, 333. 56A Memoir of Thomas Bewick Written by Himself, ed.

The passage in which Howlett recounted the history of a farm servant who 'by the labours of husbandry alone' had supported his wife and four children suggests the powerful appeal of the cottage scene. With the permission of the lord of the manor, the man had fenced a piece of land by the road and built a house with four 'neat apartments', a 'com- modious brewhouse', various sheds and a productive garden. It is, says Howlett, a 'rural mansion', a phrase with biblical con- notations. He recounts an evening visit to the family (on 11 August 1786), invoking his experience to assert the authenticity of the scene as 'plain and simple fact'. In ridiculing idealized descriptions of rural felicity he actually claims their emotion, profit and morality for his own supposedly realistic example: The father and second son were returning from the labours of the har- vest. In the language of the poet, the busy house-wife was plying her evening's care; and though the daughters were too big to run and lisp her sire's return, and climb his knees the envied kiss to share; yet, what was ample amends, heart-felt joy appeared in every face, and their whole- some supper was eaten with a relish, I ween, which the rich and the great but seldom know. No more let us hear of happy commoners and the wondrous rights of commonage.60 Howlett transferred qualities from commoners to landless wage labourers.61 He also recast the discourse of seventeenth-century projectors by calculating that the poor might be made prosper- ous through literally making something out of nothing: a 'barren' plot produces peas, beans, potatoes and even a grapevine.62 Sir John Sinclair, first president of the Board of Agriculture, was a public figure who commanded an authority conferred by respect for agricultural improvement on scientific principles. In a historiography which tends to distinguish between political economy, profit, self-interest, 'progress', enclosure, proletar- ianization and work discipline on the one hand, and tradition, commoners, benevolence, community and social connection on the other, Sinclair and the Board stand unequivocally for 60J.

In 1802 he too concluded a paper for the Board with an appeal to cottage life, a passage singled out for praise by the Monthly Review: can anyone figure to himself, a more delightful spectacle, than to see an industrious cottager, his busy wife, and healthy family, living in a com- fortable house, rented by himself, cultivating their little territory with their own hands and enjoying the profits arising from their own labour and industry?64 Working with spade and hoe, Sinclair's cottager, unlike Howlett's, could keep livestock, grow potatoes and other crops (even flax), and tend an orchard. In an apparently contradictory mixture of the labour market and self-sufficiency, he would pay rent, sup- ply markets, and work as much for neighbouring farmers as if he had no land at all. The quality of cottage life set a good example to children, and 'industrious domesticated habits' were an index of agrarian improvement. Significantly, this was also a pleasing spectacle, an experience linked both to theories of the picturesque and to a longer tradition of enjoying an orderly panorama of 'poor objects'. At this point, however, the scene began to escape from the realm of economic calculation into moral - and national - signification. Flowering creepers around the door bring no profit but 'indicate a greater attention to neatness, and an enjoyment of more comfort, than the occupiers of the miser- able unadorned huts in other countries can possess'.65 Virtue in a Cottage: or, A Mirror for Children in Humble Life (c. 1790) used the cottage in yet another genre to convey moral lessons to the poor through the story of Sally Bark, daughter of a day labourer and a washerwoman.66 Although Sally's parents were too poor to send her to school, her mother told improving stories while she worked at the tub: the frontispiece shows her 63 Rosalind Mitchison, Agricultural Sir John: The Life of Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, 1754-1835 (London, 1962); Neeson, Commoners, ch. 1. 64 John Sinclair, Essays on Miscellaneous Subjects (London, 1802), essay 2: 'Obser- vations on the means of enabling a cottager to keep a cow, by the produce of a small portion of arable land', 42; Monthly Review, xl (Mar. 1803), 292. 65John Sinclair, The Code of Agriculture, 5th edn (London, 1832), appendix xiii, 49 (quoting from Farey, General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire, ii, 214). 66 Virtue in a Cottage: or, A Mirror for Children in Humble Life (London, [1790?]).

Sally tried hard to keep herself clean; her industrious sister pieced together a dress from seventy-nine scraps of linen, the sort of behaviour which other commentators took to be a sign of distress rather than of virtue.67 The Barks were poor, but they grew vegetables and their house was 'clean and tight'. Their homely repast may have been only bread and cheese and a few boiled potatoes, but it was consumed with the contentment, cordiality and love so often absent from wealthier tables. Such virtue attracted a female patron and Sally went to school. Virtue in a Cottage taught conventional eighteenth-century arguments for contentment, but gave these lessons a new setting.68 The cottage stood for self-reliance rewarded with outside help, contentment, hard 67 Davies, Case of Labourers in Husbandry, 28. 68 For the conventional arguments for contentment, see Edward Welchman, A Practical Discourse on the Parable of Dives and Lazarus (London, 1704), 3-5; see also William Paley, Reasons for Contentment, Addressed to the Labouring Part of the British Public (London, 1793).</page><page sequence="18">86 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 184 work, cleanliness and moral instruction. Virtue was given a physical, interior location and expressed in familial affections. Again, the extravagant detail (seventy-nine scraps of linen) and the sense that the adjectives are working hard to convey com- plex messages suggest the centrality of the image and its ideo- logical deployment. Where Sinclair or Howlett promoted national prosperity through agriculture, the author of Virtue in a Cottage evoked an economy of morality and deference for a very different audience. The cottage was, nevertheless, a com- mon denominator in both views of social improvement, most consistently in the depiction of domestic relations. III I now turn to questions of chronology and significance. When did interest in cottages emerge? Where did it come from? And what did this mode of thinking enable commentators on pov- erty to achieve that other frames of reference did not permit? Few early eighteenth-century writers took any interest in the houses of the poor. Defoe made occasional references to dwell- ings and hearths to comment upon working habits and manu- facturing processes; he was also interested in well-ordered family life as a bulwark against poverty. However, housing lacked analytic and emotional weight in Defoe's argument. When he described meeting a woman living in a cave, noting ruddy children, garden, animals and clean and neat rooms, the episode had many of the elements of later social description, but was an isolated reference, related as a curiosity and used simply to demonstrate the virtues of contentment.69 Timothy Nourse took pleasure from the sight of a cottage and associated it with a distinctive - 'rough' - way of life, but significantly his 'rural mansion' was created through the occupation and cultivation of land, unsupported by any scenes of docility, wife, garden, children or supper. It required no overt concept of domestic life, no elaboration of internal space. Nourse has nothing to say about sexual difference.70 Around 1700 the 69 Daniel Defoe, A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, 2 vols.

If they explained why the poor disliked indoor relief they referred simply to the absence of 'Friends'.74 In 1755 the Revd John Clayton offered a rare description of domestic life. Manchester cottages, he chided, were sordid and infectious with cobwebby ceilings, walls bespattered with filth, and dirty, dusty furniture. Inhabitants lacked decent clothes and 'a cleanly wholesome bed'. Clayton's was a commentary on poorly regulated families, idleness and the evil effects of luxury, tea and drink; his counter-image of good fires and sweet comfortable lodgings described a charity institution.75 Mid-century works on poverty did not clearly differentiate between men and women; unless attention focused on a parti- cular social group (prostitutes, pregnant women, potential sailors), they were 'the poor' or a generic 'poor man'. Sexual difference is, however, more apparent in moral reform literature, 71 John Cary, An Account of the Proceedings of the Corporation of Bristol, in Execution of the Act of Parliament for the Better Employing and Maintaining the Poor of that City (London, 1700), 7. 72 Thomas Alcock, Observations on the Defects of the Poor Laws, and on the Causes and Consequences of the Great Increase and Burden of the Poor (London, 1752), 7-8.

Complaints that men who drank in alehouses left their wives and children to starve come closest to the later cottage scene.76 By the late eighteenth century gendered discussions of poverty and interest in the poor's housekeeping had become commonplace; emphasis also shifted from city- dwellers to agricultural labourers. In 1787 Sarah Trimmer, the Sunday school pioneer, defended wives from complaints such as Clayton's: without changes of clothes and soap, how could a poor woman keep her house and children clean? She still main- tained this line in 1801, but now specifically worried about women in the rural economy and described how cottages with some land helped poor widows to provide for their children.77 Interest in cottages emerged from broader social and cultural contexts. Central to its articulation was a series of discourses with their own histories of development in the second half of the eighteenth century: political economy, sensibility and a type of comparative sociology. Their proponents identified and prom- ised to resolve pressing contemporary problems, including a perceived crisis in rural affairs, rising poor rates and a social pheno- menon called pauperism. Two distinct but related debates - on agricultural improvement and poor-law reform - brought the cottage into focus and enabled commentators to apply ideas about dwellings to concerns about the poor in general. All of this created new, socially specific understandings of manliness and independence, which observers largely trimmed of any radical possibilities. Significantly, the cottage scene was closely associ- ated with professional men, a group negotiating its own place in the eighteenth-century social and gender order by claiming spe- cialist knowledge and expertise on matters of public concern.78 Agricultural experts combined the techniques and rhetoric of political economy with mixtures of aesthetic theory and self- conscious humanitarianism, directing it towards a previously neglected group: rural labourers. They and other experts applied 76 For example J. Disney, An Essay upon the Execution of the Laws against Immorality and Profaneness, 2nd edn (London, 1710), 59-60.

Between the 1770s and 1790s, land agents, farmers, land- owners and clergymen who published on agricultural matters emerged as influential observers of rural life and poverty, and as important sources of data that could be used to discuss social policy. Nathaniel Kent, for example, pioneered techniques of land management and framed a much-cited model of cottages and hovels. He advocated a scheme of landholding in which improvement, humanitarianism and advantage went together, and no more so than in the cottage.79 Kent's public-spirited gentleman enclosed common land and provided comfortable dwellings so that employment and population increased as poor rates fell. Kent's preference for smaller farms was not generally endorsed, but other agricultural writers shared his concern with the correct exploitation of land, the social balance between landlord and tenant, and the economics of labour, land, pro- ductivity and poor relief. They too developed a specific interest in the dwellings of the lower classes and supplied detailed stud- ies supported with examples and statistics. When the Board of Agriculture instructed its surveyors to investigate cottages, wages and poor rates in each British county, it established these topics as comparative measures of national success and its pub- lications systematized comparative data for England, Scotland and Wales; debates about the effects of enclosure on rural soci- ety highlighted them further during the 1780s and 1790s.80 During the 1790s, a second professional group, architects, turned its expertise in regulating social relations towards agricul- tural improvement and the labourer's cottage.8' A sufficient 79 Pamela Horn, 'An Eighteenth-Century Land Agent: The Career of Nathaniel Kent (1737-1810)', Agric.

The architect Joseph Gandy, for example, attributed his cottage designs to humane proposals published in the Communications to the Board of Agriculture, while Board sur- veyors assessed picturesque and productive qualities.82 Cottage commentary grew increasingly elaborate and frequent at the turn of the century, supported by the attentions of a new phil- anthropic organization which aimed to harness science and Christianity: the Society for Bettering the Condition and In- creasing the Comforts of the Poor (SBCP), founded by Thomas Bernard in 1796.83 By 1818 William Marshall had reviewed so many discussions of cottage cow grounds and their effects on labourers that he declared it a 'stale' subject, complaining too that a set of cottage plans 'very much resemble [s] other fancy wares of that sort, with which, one would imagine, the market must, by this time, be overstocked'."4 Architectural commentary and designs continued to proliferate during the early nineteenth century.85 Nevertheless, while the connections were productive, architecture and agriculture also made contradictory demands: picturesque depictions of the cottage, which valorized the rough and irregular, remained at odds with characterizations that emphasized neatness and moral regularity.86 Tension was also evident in uncertainty about what to call cottage occupants. Richard Elsam, an architect, used 'peasantry' in a sense simultaneously archaic and modern to describe wage labourers in a picturesque setting. 'Peasantry' was also syno- 82 Everett, Tory View of Landscape, ch. 4; Joseph Gandy, Designs for Cottages, Cottage Farms, and Other Rural Buildings: Including Entrance Gates and Lodges (London, 1805), p. iii; John Clark, General View of the Agriculture of the County of Hereford (London, 1794). 83 The Reports of the Society for Bettering the Condition and Increasing the Comforts of the Poor, i (London, 1798), p. i; Donna T.

In this sense, 'peasantry' drew parallels between British cottage- dwellers and landholders elsewhere in Europe, another product of eighteenth-century comparative political economy and soci- ology.87 Marshall certainly made the connection but would have nothing of it. He took patriotic exception to such 'exotic notions', protesting that the term 'peasant' was more appropriate to Russia or India than to England.88 Proliferation of expertise threw open fundamental questions about national history, social character and economic structure to suggest new and contentious ideas about poverty: its origins, constitutional signi- ficance, effects and remedies. These also featured in debate about the poor-relief system, the second major influence on discussions of dwellings. It was through this debate that cot- tages and the plight of the agricultural labourer came to stand for the problem of poverty in general. From controversy in the 1760s over methods of reforming the poor, and sentimental approaches to the deserving, attention broadened at the turn of the century to address newly identified problems of pauperism, population and dependence. During the second half of the eighteenth century, those who devised schemes to reduce the poor rates gave increasing atten- tion to theories of incentive and to the effects on character of environment, both rural and urban. As large-scale provision of employment no longer appeared simple, profitable or feasible, feeling offered a new frame of reference. Proponents of the workhouse attempted to harness lower-class preferences and dislikes, ambition and emulation, to elicit socially desirable behaviour. Dean Tucker, the Gloucester cleric, applied com- mercial theory to his scheme of 1760 in which behaviour and attitude determined an individual's conditions: from sleeping on the floor to the comforts of a flock bed.89 Opponents warned against plans that 'annihilate all family connexions'.90 87 Elsam, Hints for Improving the Condition of the Peasantry; Charles Vancouver, General View of the Agriculture of the County of Devon (London, 1808), 468; Joanna Innes, 'The Distinctiveness of the English Poor Laws, 1750-1850', unpubd paper. 88 Marshall, Review and Abstract of the County Reports, v, 575. 89 Josiah Tucker, The Manifold Causes of the Increase of the Poor Distinctly Set Forth (Gloucester, 1760), 29. 90 Richard Burn, The History of the Poor Laws: With Observations (London, 1764), 231.</page><page sequence="24">92 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 184 Controversy over incentive and inclination produced closer attention than before to lower-class life in an attempt to discern the most effective behavioural levers to manage the poor: 'Let the poor themselves be consulted, and they will chuse houses like unto those they formerly inhabited'.91 An infusion of senti- ment - a discourse which combined universalist claims with an interest in sexual politics - developed themes of humble affection, yoking them to major preoccupations with national wealth and security. Whereas early eighteenth-century obser- vers had generally viewed the poor as rough and unpolished, commentators might now attribute psychological complexity to them. Robert Potter, a Norfolk curate concerned with rural poverty, asserted that houses of industry created the very mate- rial and conjugal comforts absent from 'miserable cottages'. But he reserved outdoor relief for the 'honest, industrious cot- tager' who 'by a long continued residence, an association of ideas, a partial affection to one particular spot, is wedded to his little habitation . . . It is a prejudice: but it is founded in human nature; and from this prejudice the noblest of our passions, the love of our country arises'.92 By the 1780s, these criteria were well established in the assessment of reform measures and schemes. 'A Clergyman', for example, rejected Thomas Gilbert's poor-law reform bills and declared that the poor were no different from their superiors and suffered when torn from a 'native cottage', familiar surroundings, relations and friends.93 Also well entrenched by the late eighteenth century was the expertise of a third professional body, the clergy, who now supplanted urban magistrates and reformers as a key source of information about the poor: 'clergymen are, or ought to be, in the nature of their profession, the best judges of the wants and comforts of cottagers'.94 Clergymen supplied information to Frederick Eden in the 1790s and they consti- tuted a sub-group of the Board of Agriculture's county survey- ors.95 Anglican geography, patchy in metropolitan and new 91 Ibid., 233. 92 Potter, Observations on the Poor Laws, 40-1, 53-4. 93 A Clergyman, Useful and Practical Observations on Agriculture: With Some Essays Annexed, on Inclosures, the Improvement of the Country and the Poor (London, 1783), 221-2. 94 Marshall, Review and Abstract of the County Reports, ii, 446. 95 Eden, State of the Poor, i, p. ii.</page><page sequence="25">COTTAGE CONVERSATIONS 93 3.

Late-century debate recycled old complaints that the poor cost more than ever to maintain, while their condition was as bad as before, or even worse. New, however, were references to pauper- ism, independence and manliness. Associated with the new moral science of political economy, enlarged by T. R. Malthus's the- ory of population, pauperism was the unsatisfactory condition of those who relied on charity or the parish to survive. It advanced a powerful explanatory framework in a period when a large number of women and, perhaps significantly, an increasing number of men depended on poor relief.96 In a related move, the concept of independence, which in the early eighteenth century had conveyed presumption, political interference and insubordination among the poor, was redefined. Now it could signify those moral qualities that induced the male labourer to support himself and his dependants while remaining socially 96Mitchell Dean, The Constitution of Poverty: Towards a Genealogy of Liberal Governance (London, 1991); A.

In the process, commentators developed concepts of sexual difference already employed in campaigns to regulate sexuality.99 Many more words may have been written about the delights of the cottage than about the dwellings of the degraded poor, but it was pauperism which preoccupied observers and attracted interest in the cottage. For critics of institutional relief, the cottage continued to stand in contrast with the dirty, overcrowded and ineffective workhouse.100 Cottagers and their children displayed the traits and habits necessary for participa- tion in Friendly Societies and Benefit Societies, promoted as a means for the poor to provide for their own misfortunes. Cottages brought social stability, discouraged pubs, lowered prices, reduced the poor rates and provided an incentive to good behaviour.1?1 As moments of pride in the celebration of British liberty, cottage scenes traded on manly vigour, a quality poor-law commentators sought to instil in the effete pauper, and exploited an aggressive, martial claim to produce sturdy (agricultural) warriors against immediate or recent experience of revolution and imperial warfare. Very specific preoccupations with pauperism thus developed the cottage scene, which in turn elaborated the concept of pauperism itself. 97 Monthly Review, Iv (Jan. 1808), 53 (quoting approvingly from Rudge, General View of the Agriculture of the County of Gloucester); see also Archer, 'Nineteenth- Century Allotment', 34. 98 Peter Mandler, 'The Making of the New Poor Law Redivivus', Past and Present, no. 117 (Nov. 1987); Peter Mandler, 'Tories and Paupers: Christian Polit- ical Economy and the Making of the New Poor Law', Hist.

Humble and insigni- ficant as he may appear abroad, he is of consequence and authority at home. In his own house he finds those who respect him, who obey him; those, to whom he may say, go, and they go, come, and they come. He is not insensible to the charities of father, son, and husband.102 According to early nineteenth-century observers, particularly those employing the terms of political economy, the degraded and demoralized pauper clung to everything 'low and miserable', was improvident, sullen, dangerous and listless.103 Many signs of this predominantly rural crisis were domestic, precipitated by low wages, high prices and bad legislation.'04 In 1815 William Lisle Bowles, a Gloucestershire cleric and magistrate, argued that the poor laws had extinguished 'domestic happi- ness' and destroyed 'the sacred tenderness of affection, the moral respect of married life; they also produce an endless suc- cession of crimes' branching out from illicit sexual relations.105 Pauperism had an explicit imperial context, established in Enlightenment arguments about the development of human society and civilization. For the Revd C. D. Brereton in the 1820s, the English able-bodied pauper resembled 'the African negro, the Arabian slave, or the Russian peasant in vassalage'; once pauperism was broken, labourers would find 'a pleasure and a pride in their cottages, gardens, families, and even in their work'.1'06 Irish comparisons supplied evidence of either extreme demoralization or hardy independence, an equivocation with significant longer-term implications.'07 In exemplifying self-sufficiency and quiescent domesticity, cottage scenes pre- sented an emotionally compelling antidote to pauperism.

His patriotic name recalled pre-Reformation and pre-poor-law hospitality, but the Society's account drew a late eighteenth- century conclusion that the poor should support themselves.'08 Although such material allowed the poor a narrow form of agency, or 'independence', this was far from straightforward (as befits a concept with a long and controversial history). In 1792 John Howard's biographer singled out his subject's cottage- building at Cardington in the 1760s as a demonstration of philanthropy in a 'private situation', and then justified it in terms drawn from the 1790s debate on poverty. According to a narrative which doubled as an account of conjugal harmony, Howard was inspired by his wife's sentimental preference for a 'pretty cottage' over a trip to London; he selected his poor ten- ants for their industry and sobriety, gave them employment and made them independent. He exercised 'the superintendence of a master and father combined'. Subordination, the reader is told, was amply rewarded if it saved the tenant from the work- house in old age.109 Uncontrolled, a 'love of independence' could be dangerous (hence the arguments about how much land could safely be given for a cottage garden), but that apparent contradiction between independence and submission resolved the problem.110 Howard's tenants-at-will also had 'rights': farm- workers were made independent by cottage amenities, which ensured they were tied into the labour market and were dependent on their employers."' Crucially, independence did not extend to the relations between husband and wife, men and women. Cottage scenes and late-century discussions of poverty made explicit reference to manliness, a virtue that connoted inde- pendence, moral fortitude and foresight; those who denied poor men the opportunity to express it, lacked it themselves.112 Since its product, 'domestic happiness', could be pursued in 108 Reports of the SBCP, ii, 293-308; see also Sinclair, Essays on Miscellaneous Sub- jects, 40. 109 John Aikin, A View of the Life, Travels, and Philanthropic Labors of the Late John Howard (1792; Philadelphia), 1794, 20-5.

Im- agined cottage scenes extended interest in ascertaining the most effective work incentives, including marriage, and in the pro- cess codified the meanings of sexual difference. Commentators appealed to feeling: wives and children relied on men to main- tain them, the old and feeble needed support from their adult children.'15 As parishes increasingly refused to give women individual relief, the late eighteenth-century poor-law system formalized the significance of paternal authority and conjugal relations.116 Cottages could be mobilized as one strategy in the shift away from institutional relief (such as hospitals) targeted at specific groups in crisis, and towards mechanisms that encouraged self-reliance among a broad category of labourers.117 Cottage gardens and comforts absorbed different opinions on appropriate wage levels and standards of living; on the creation of alternative economies or extension of the capitalist one; on questions of compulsion or encouragement.'18 While 'manliness' was supposedly derived from human nature and therefore applied across the social scale, it was of course socially specific. A form of manliness that lowered the poor rates had attributes - notably a quality of contented, not strategic, submission - that hardly applied to the banker or aristocrat.

Liberty and property, like the associated concept of independ- ence, were complex. In these debates, liberty conveyed inde- pendence, something British, and a soothing consolation for poverty.119 William Paley entrenched secure ownership of (minor) property as a reason for lower-class contentment.120 For some, property, in the form of neat, weather-proof dwellings, settled the poor on the soil, harking back to concern about the wandering poor, undercutting rival diagnoses of underemploy- ment.121 Property - least contentious when viewed as the pos- session of domestic comfort - was a social preservative: it gave the poor man a stake in his country, but did not free him from the obligation to labour for others since it was primarily the wage relationship that legitimized acquisition and ownership among the lower classes.122 With liberty and property as the yardsticks of civility and progress, the social and political dependence of female and infant inferiors underwrote the system: Richard Elsam's peasant was 'the monarch of his mansion'.123 Manliness guaranteed self-sufficiency, and, for the more conservative, social deference among the poor.124 It re- focused an enduring eighteenth-century commonplace that the poor's only asset was the physical body and an ability to labour.125 It defined workhouse debate, which turned on a question whether indoor relief denied conjugal liberty, an effect which could be condemned as punitive and emasculating or 119 SBCP, Information for Cottagers, 10.

Radicals extended, but fundamentally shared, this view. William Cobbett directed quasi-biblical advice in Cottage Economy (1821) to 'the man, who is doing well, who is in good health, who has a blooming and dutiful and cheerful and happy family about him, and who passes his day of rest among them'.127 It was through this for- mulation of sexual politics that Cobbett and those he criticized shared a vision of the cottage. This particular understanding of masculinity required as incentive and reward comforts provided by women.128 James Johnson, deputy governor of the Bristol Corporation of the Poor, recommended occasional visiting of the poor in their dwellings to enquire: 'does the wife study the comfort of her labouring-husband?'129 Commentators promoted cleanliness, a symbolic category that marked social integrity and moral order, and was regulated by women. It is probably no accident that Sally Bark's mother was a washerwoman and that her daughters' virtue was displayed in their efforts to keep themselves clean and neat, a concern at this time directed at clothes rather than the skin. This emphasis emerged from an eighteenth-century context in which physical cleanliness was less interesting than sexual continence. Supporters of the late seventeenth-century campaign for the reformation of manners had understood 'uncleanness' in spiritual terms; in texts such as Virtue in a Cot- tage cleanliness is a form of social, moral and bodily discipline that both secures and displays the individual's merit in a house- hold setting.130 If cleanliness seemed a tamer, more superficial 126 See, for example, John Berkeley Monck, General Reflections on the System of the Poor Laws, with a Short View of Mr Whitbread's Bill, and a Comment on It (London, 1807), 12-13; J.

Women were not, however, exempted from a general requirement that the poor work, produce and earn. The neces- sity of female employment was assumed; more troubling were signs of underemployment, especially in rural areas, and in localities with no or declining manufacture.131 Cottage economy presented a way of thinking about female labour. The earl of Winchilsea, a supporter of the Board of Agriculture, proposed to occupy women with cows and cottage gardens, leaving men to work uninterrupted for their employers.132 Others toyed with schemes to find work for the female poor in the fields or inside the cottage, where they could give simultaneous attention to domestic concerns.133 Most seemed stumped by economic difficulties and fell back on general and familiar suggestions. Faced with the plight of women in districts with no employ- ment she deemed suitable, Sarah Trimmer declared: 'I am at a loss for an answer'.134 In other instances the question was deferred, but never negated, by a different emphasis that distinguished men from women and explored power relations between them. Thomas Ruggles, fixing on cottage squalor and useless husbands, suggested that married women should control their own earn- ings: a potentially radical reworking of domestic authority.'35 More conventionally, architects, agriculturists and didactic moral writers aimed to improve the physical and therefore the moral condition of the poor through their housing, not least as a theatre of sexual difference. These observers were therefore concerned with the proper organization and division of interior space, setting the scene for the exercise of lower-class domestic 131 Davies, Case of Labourers in Husbandry, 83-5; Thomas Davis, General View of the Agriculture of the County of Wilts, with Observations on the Means of its Improve- ment (London, 1794), 154-5.

Indeed its comforts were largely affective. Hannah More's Shepherd of Salisbury Plain points out his 'cottage' to Mr Johnson, who exclaims: 'What, that hovel with only one room above and one below, with scarcely any chimney?'139 Domestic affection transformed a hovel into a cottage so that, as was the case with Sinclair's flowering creepers, emotion rather than productivity appeared to be located at the centre, the heart of the scene. Yet this was an effect of translation, in which affec- tion stood for self-sufficiency and self-sufficiency stood for national, moral and financial profit, a line of association that commodified feelings as a means to 'improvement'. This, and attempts to address female underemployment, suggest the complexity of fireside scenes. They cannot be taken as a simple formulation of female domestic retirement, but prescribe for women a doubled relationship with the market: through their own activities and through the psychological environment they produce for male wage labourers. Emotion and sexuality pervaded the clean cottage. The contradictions and uncertainties this produced exemplify the doubled meanings of desire (as both economic and sexual) in this period.140 The Barks's house was 'tight', a term commonly associated with female sexual propriety. Assertions that the poor were no less attached to 'domestic endearments' than the rich connected the cottage scene directly with arguments about population: dwellings were a means to increase it, and, after 1798, were at the heart of Malthusian debate. Malthus endorsed part of the cottage argument - comfort and sex in the form of 'virtuous love', prudence and material incentive - but also reversed it to argue that dwellings created paupers. He opposed Samuel Whitbread's 1807 bill because it would have 138 William Atkinson, Views of Picturesque Cottages with Plans (London, 1805), p. viii; Elsam, Hints for Improving the Condition of the Peasantry, 36; 'Plan Suggested for Mature Consideration', 225-6.

Brereton accepted Malthus's prin- ciples, but not the way they were used to interpret the current condition of the rural poor, arguing instead that pauperism was the consequence of injustice, not of population surplus.143 Improvers and reformers were certainly less interested than their early eighteenth-century predecessors in the mass of the poor, the 'hands' which created the wealth of the nation, and now recommended ways to encourage particular types of fam- ily.144 Affections of the sort associated with the cottage offered new ways to secure desired ends: family feeling made depend- ent children a useful method of extracting parental labour and was judged an effective means to discipline children to work.145 Lawrence Braddon's ambitious early eighteenth-century plans to take 'supernumerary' children into 'collegiate cities' was no longer in the same frame of intellectual reference, even if ele- ments survived in the practice of parish apprenticeship to employers outside the locality.146 Inconsistencies, especially those between population theory and discussions that made 141 T.

Nathaniel Kent had compro- mised decency to economy, assuming that boys would leave home early, but by the end of the century, whether from moral indignation, architectural grandiosity or restructuring of the rural labour market, this was no longer possible. Architects busy about labourers' cottages were alert to the dangers of improperly mixing sexes and generations. 148 V By the early nineteenth century the cottage had many different, and not necessarily consistent, meanings: was it a genteel retreat or a labourer's dwelling? an instrument of reform or nothing more than a pleasing scene? Cottages figured in discussions of migration, manufactures, agricultural profit, the economics of poor relief, and the reformation of manners. Some social com- mentators thought cottages an antidote to poverty, others invoked them to advance rather different analyses. The flexibility of this idea upon which so many different, even contradictory, meanings and contexts were pressed, and its fluidity across generic boundaries, suggest its complex intellectual ancestry and imaginative force. It was one of the few instances, perhaps the only one, in the eighteenth century of an upper-class fashion that blurred the boundary between rich and poor, and revalued a marker of poverty. Both these elements - its multiplicity and its uncertain social basis - indicate that something interesting was going on. The cottage, its hearth, doorstep and garden, provided a new arena for exploring ideas about poverty, crucially, one that accommodated both sentiment and attention to individual human behaviour. It offered a mixed group of commentators, who perhaps shared nothing more than an assumption that morality mattered, a method of dramatizing social relations among the poor and of formulating social incentives in terms 147 Kent, Hints to Gentlemen of Landed Property, 229. 148 Ibid., 232; Elsam, Hints for Improving the Condition of the Peasantry, 6; Wood, Series of Plans, 5-6; Mr Luxmore, quoted in Vancouver, General View of the Agri- culture of the County of Devon, 96-7; Ann Kussmaul, Servants in Husbandry in Early Modern England (Cambridge, 1981).</page><page sequence="37">COTTAGE CONVERSATIONS 105 of sexual difference and conjugality. The cottage gave indus- triousness, godliness and obedience new associations and material forms, notably cleanliness, neatness, independence and decency. It was the implicit setting for discussions of cheap cookery and clothing, and for comparisons between life among the poor in North and South, and in England and Scotland. In short, the cottage encapsulated crucial issues about the circum- stances, lives, choices and expenses of the poor. But this had not always been the case. Even in minimalist form, the late-century cottage scene expressed very specific concerns about pauperism. The cottage grew relevant because commentators now valued family affection as a work incentive and located it in dwellings. Neither domestic ties nor cottage cosiness had been all that interesting earlier (which is not, of course, to say that the poor were strangers to affection or that any sort of domestic life was unheard of before 1760). However, it does suggest why cottage promoters had to work at elaborat- ing details, and why decency and separation of the sexes grew in importance as motivations and affections were established. During the second half of the eighteenth century, understandings of poverty shaped cottage scenes and lent them an emotional charge. War and fear of revolution in the 1790s intensified the pressures to see the British poor content and settled at home (understood in both individual and national terms). Cottage scenes were a versatile means by which observers of the poor (and the poor themselves) explored contested understandings of poverty, property, progress and social relations. In spite of appeals to tradition, social harmony, hospitality, basic spade husbandry and the past, cottages projected new values of inde- pendence based on a very particular association with male authority. To regard cottage conversations as backward-looking paternalism underestimates their complexities and novelties, especially their interest in gender politics and sexuality.149 The developing eighteenth-century discussion of lower-class domestic life indicates complex ideological realignments. While many historians have singled out the 1780s and 1790s as signi- ficant decades of change, generalizations about modernity and capitalism, and arguments about the emergence of some new 149 John Crowley presents a parallel argument in which physical comfort - incor- porated into a humanitarian agenda in the later eighteenth century - is asso- ciated with commerce and technology: 'Sensibility of Comfort'.</page><page sequence="38">106 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 184 gender order, have been hotly contested in recent years, not least through research on the poor.150 However, in this particular case, evidence suggests that a refocusing of sexual difference and authority did indeed take place in national debate during the last third of the century. But it would be a mistake to present this emphasis as a simple shift towards 'domestic ideol- ogy' or a Rousseauan ideal of nature, since it was applied explicitly and specifically to the poor in order to locate pauper- ism in failures of lower-class masculinity and to promote female sexual virtue through proper employment. The complexities and social differentials of this realignment are also evident in the careers of those like Nathaniel Kent and Hannah More who used the political significance of the cottage to assert their own professional expertise. While it is probable that interest in housing consolidated in response to debate about enclosure and agricultural change, economic motivation does not adequately explain the forms cottage scenes took. Recent research has, for example, demon- strated that farmers were much more equivocal about the effects of allotment schemes than was once deduced from their material interests, and this study has suggested that enthusiasm for cottages crossed boundaries that demarcated different approaches to wealth and the state.'51 Observers of the poor were not immune to pleasure; aesthetic ideals and images from poetry and painting informed their descriptions. From specific economic contexts, and through the influence of other factors, not least the imagination, the cottage assumed a wider relevance as the agricultural labourer replaced urban misery as a central motif of poverty. This happened not because agricultural labourers were more representative of Britain (by 1801 roughly a third of the population was engaged in agriculture),152 but because debate was framed in a way that allowed these figures to become archetypal, as carriers of generalized, universal human emotions. Cottages, with their central themes of affection and productivity (both human and vegetable), were an import- ant resource in naturalizing responses to social and economic 150 For example Sharpe, Adapting to Capitalism, 99, 142. 151Jeremy Burchardt, 'Rural Social Relations, 1830-50: Opposition to Allot- ments for Labourers', Agric.
