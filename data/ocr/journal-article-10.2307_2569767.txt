SOCIOLOGY IN AMERICA: IMPRESSIONS OF A VISITOR RICHARD THURNWALD' Universit of Berlin HERE are some persons who, after hurriedly chasing through T a country, feel justified in expressing their judgment. Sometimes, the shorter their stay, the more categorical are their assertions. The less experience the observer has to puzzle him, the easier it is for him to generalize. Others, how- ever, sometimes spoil the work of talented imagination by being too scrupulous. Lafcadio Hearn, after having lived forty years in Japan, confessed that he then knew less of the nation's character than after his initial visit. It is true, the task is different in each country, and with each topic. The writer, who belongs to the second type, feels somewhat embarrassed by the invitation of the editor of this journal for an article in which he should "challenge American sociology," referring not only to "its scientific work, but also making effective application." A foreigner may be more aloof in his emotions and personal predilections, though his factual knowl- edge may sometimes be inadequate. It is a great pleasure, however, to respond to this opportunity for a frank and unre- stricted exposition of his views. His criticism itself is "challenged," and this may condone some arrogance in giving it expression. Science, particularly social science, is always dependent upon the actual state of conditions in society, and of the current modes of thinking and evaluating. This is a decisive factor for the sociologist who is generally a part of the social body he studies. In all periods of crisis man turns to his ratio2 for alleviating his distress. In such cases his eyes are cast, full of ques- tions, to the social sciences for assistance, for they impersonate the ratio. A discus- sion of contemporary sociology, therefore, should start with a short survey of the present epoch, for out of this background, directly or indirectly, the problems of the social sciences emerge. The writer is not now visiting this coun- try for the first time. He first visited it in I909; the second time he stayed about a year and a half (from the end of i9i5 to the middle of 1917); and this time he arrived in the fall of 193 i A comparison of cross-sections of these periods shows profound alterations in the material con- 1 Visiting professor in Yale University. 2 In the mneaning of the Latin word, designating: intellect, judgment, discretion. i6I SOCIAL FORCES, VOL. XI, NO. 2</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL FORCES ditions in America as well as in the mind of the people. Most striking of all are the changes now taking place. Indi- vidualism and capitalism are being criti- cized; the influence of the churches is waning; freedom of sex is being proclaimed a population of stocks other than those of the past is filling the big cities; and the acculturation of the immigrants of the last decades seems to offer new problems. Instead of opening the enormous resources of the country which still exist, this popu- lation does not seem to show the same initiative as the earlier immigrants, who, in spite of much greater obstacles, swarmed over the huge territory of the United States. Either that, or their initiative is directed in another way. The refulgence of the frontier times has long since disappeared, although a great many everyday evaluations are still colored by its afterglow. Thus we see the American faith in individual responsibility, in help- fulness, in enterprise, in the boundlessness of ideals, and aims, and, notwithstanding the present depression, in optimism. The attitudes seem justified when one considers the fact that, in this country, there are only fifteen persons per square kilometer, whereas in Germany 134 people live in the same area. In spite of the particularity of American problems, a number of them is shared with other countries. It is true, however, that in each country these problems assume special Characteristics. Capitalism, so- cialism, democracy, poverty, and so forth, have their own implications in America. The excessive use of machinery was due in part, at least, to the lack of human hands and to the vastness of the land. Colonization was responsible for a differ- ent attitude toward the supreme power of the state. Many things were left to pri- vate initiative, to personal relations, etc. In Europe the development of the use of machinery was hampered by the vested interests of the guilds and of the feudal institutions. Socialism was closely asso- ciated with the liberation from old forms of political domination. Other problems are more generally com- mon to our time, though also, of course, with special features in each country. Typical are the consequences of the World War. The life in the trenches, the sepa- ration from home, the rough life in which so many nations participated, modified the mental attitudes of both sexes. Many former restrictions in the relationships between the sexes became obsolete, the younger generation became emancipated from previous limitations; many other conventions were revised, and so on. The difficulties experienced by neurotic persons in readapting themselves to the "normal" conditions of life can be observed in all states which participated in the great struggle. The productive process during the war and immediately after it en- couraged a "rationalization," an econo- mising of man-power, which finally became partly responsible for the present depression, with its numbers of unem- ployed in all industrial centers. At the same time new countries were encouraged to embark on the way of industrialization. These few examples may indicate the background from which the present ratio in social investigation emerges. Socio- logical investigation encounters here a vast field of research which should bear fruit for rational planning in social life. It is always doubtful, however, how far such planning can be attained by agree- ment of the leading forces, and further- more to what extent such planning really will prove to be successful and ultimately reach just those goals toward which it is aiming. This is because we are unable to include in our conspectus all the factors involved. Consequently we speak of the</page><page sequence="3">SOCIOLOGY: ITS CONTENT AND APPLICATION I 63 "irrationalism" or, better, of the "super- rationalism" of social life. Planning is good and is unavoidable, but the results achieved are often quite different from those intended. Only the plannings and intentions of the World War need be cited. Here are some of the inevitable shortcomings of all social sciences. Each science, however, is determined by another factor; i.e., by its history and tradition, and by the dominant thought in the councry where it is located. This is particularly noticeable in German sociology. A few words may explain this. From the outset conditions were very different for German sociology. Roughly speaking, it was hampered by a widespread misunderstanding which took sociology for socialism. In fact, sociol- ogy was and still is, in part, affiliated with all kinds of social reform work in all countries. In Germany, in order to single out its purely scientific character, the relation of sociology to philosophy was emphasized, which led to the speculative and - scholastic character still prevailing today. This philosophical relationship helped to promote the Formal school with its striving away from the "encyclopedic" realities, and its soaring toward the "lofty heights" of abstraction, of classification, of veneration for words, of creation of new terms, and so on. The overemphasis of this tendency led also to the wide- spread endeavor to invent new "systems" of sociology. Disregarding factual studies, the scholar tried to reach the highest goal with one ingenious jump. This is an old human trait. Each science began in this way. Human thinking started by the, same method. We call this method "magic" when we speak of "primitive" people. "Magic thinking" still predominates in many realms of sociology. German sociology also has its profes- sional organization of sociologists, based upon principles diametrically opposed to those used in America. Whereas in America an inclusive tendency can be noted, in Germany, for the reasons mentioned above, exclusiveness has reached an extreme point. A numerous claisu permits only the man introduced and voted upon to fill the place of a defunct member or of one who leaves the society. This has the obvious disadvantage of restricting membership to those who ad- here to the particular school and trend of thinking in power. If there is no outlet for activity man often deteriorates and withdraws into a dream world. Speculative system-making found its raison d'etre in the position of sociology beforei the war. But after it, conditions changed fundamentally. It is the momentum of the pre-war times that still maintains its force. For there was almost a "boom" in sociology, due to the above mentioned confusion with socialism. Every orator and mediocre writer of articles, every politician and student, tried to show himself "up to date" by at least using the word "sociol- ogy" as often as possible. In no other science was there committed a similar infringement of its "second command- ment." This "inflation" was no less detrimental to social science than the previous exclusiveness had been. Sociol- ogy now became "accepted" in some universities. The affiliation with politi- cal parties, however, made for an important constituent element which prevented unbiased factual investigations. Again a flight into speculation and scholasticism ensued. Recently, certain intellectuals have found out that they alone are able to produce "objective" sociology, since they feel themselves "'aloof" from the rest of the people. I doubt that this guarantees the results</page><page sequence="4">i64 SOCIAL FORCES promised. They do not seem to be aware of the subjectivity of their own "'aloofness." Another idea propagated by the WissenssoZiologie is the rather old truth that scientific research is dependent upon the conditions of the time and of the people. The predominating trends in German sociology have been discussed at this length to bring out the contrast with the younger American schools. These turn away from the speculative, scholastic, and sometimes verbose works of many German sociologists. The merits of Ger- man sociological thought and investiga- tion lie beyond the Formal school and its associates. Statistical research work, socio-psychological studies, biological, educational, geographical, vocational, economical, political, and other investiga- tions, are of great value. But the domi- nating Formalists refuse to give them credit within the realm of their "sociol- ogy," denouncing them as "encyclo- pedic," as "mixed," or too "detailed." They still believe in a separation of the form from the content in the social sciences; they exalt their abstractions and despise factual studies. This leads to a static concept of society. Any dynamic viewpoint would, for example, imply the necessity of historical studies. It is not realized that a great many sociological theories start from alleged facts which ought to be checked over and over again. Such, for instance, is the theory of Durk- heim on the division of labor. Shall the enormous amount of research work carried on in the field by many ethnologists remain permanently disregarded? Shall "the left hand not know what the right hand is doing," and vice versa? Shall obsolete foundations of theories be relied on indefinitely? Each science is divided into various specialties and ramifications, and it must keep up with other departments of scientific research. The social sciences entertained connections with various kinds of investigations. Some of these may be classified as relating to the social sciences directly, as statistics and all kinds of cultural studies; others more remotely, as juridical, psychiatric, or linguistic investi- gations. Sociology is impossible without the factual studies on which it has to rely. And these flow in from the most hetero- geneous sources. To reject them means to impede the progress of science. This refutation, however, is for some writers the reason for criticism directed against the modern trends in American sociology. Before discussing this, a brief statement of conditions in American sociology may be appropriate. It originated from practi- cal aims, connected with the "'betterment" of social life. There were no political affiliations or apprehensions, no escape in a world of speculative hallucinations. American sociology more than any sociol- ogy of Europe was educated and fortified in the fire of practice. It never refrained from taking interest in the neighboring branches of science, as is customary in all departments of knowledge. American sociology consequently was and is "ency- clopedic" in character. Most important was its classification within the "natural sciences." American scientific thought evaluated them highly, in opposition to the European hypertrophy of "philoso- phy." Consequently, sociology here wanted to construct its house in con- formity with the method of the natural sciences. The human being, as well as associations of human beings, is considered an object for disinterested investigation in the same way as are chemical processes or physical phenomena. Research therefore has to be "objective," accurate, and documentary. The phenomena of aggre- gative life have to be based on those found in biology. Moreover, in sociology prac-</page><page sequence="5">SOCIOLOGY: ITS CONTENT AND APPLICATION I65 tical usefulness has never been lost sight of, just as, for instance, in electrical re- search the application has been for pur- poses of daily life. Much work has been carried on within a limited sphere of phenomena, in order to serve just such practical aims. Empirical observations and even experiments provide the material on which sociology shall base its structure. Social phenomena are interpreted as dy- namic processes the changes in which have to be studied in order to realise their trends. These, however, are reduced to mental patterns prevailing within a group or a time. Psychological interpretation based on mass investigations has been developed along empirical lines. The organization of the American sociol- ogists is strong in number, not only on account of the vastness of the country but even more because of the inclusion of all kinds of people interested in sociological problems: psychiatrists, linguists, statis- ticians, historians, economists, officials, teachers, business-men, etc. This cer- tainly has the advantage of spreading interest in sociology far more than does the seclusion of only a few "initiates" within their "esoteric" creed. It is democratic in the American sense of the word, and does not encourage the rigid dogmatism of any one school. A draw- back may be seen in just that inclusive- ness, as the proper character of sociological studies and their scientific bearing may occasionally be inundated by aims foreign to the particular object of the association. There is no perfect human institution. A differentiation between those primarily interested in sociology and those secon- darily participating in its work, and a division into a number of branches can easily compensate for that unimportant disadvantage. Criticism has been proffered against American methods of sociological investi- gation and research. How far can it be considered justifiable, how far not? The classification of sociology among the "'natural sciences" is simply "shocking" to the average European. For him there exists not the faintest doubt that the "'philosophical sciences'' (Geisteswisseni- schaften) are something different from and "'superior" to the "natural sciences." Mind (Geist) has been put by them beyond nature. It has assumed a magic meaning. The difference refers to the fact that all human affairs are more intensively asso- ciated with man's existence, with his feelings, emotions, and interests. The same "dimensionality" of life makes "'understanding" easier, unbiased impar- tiality more difficult. Man cannot divest himself of his human nature. Not only that: each individual belongs to a certain nation, a certain creed; he enjoys his education here or there; he lives among a definite circle of friends and associates, etc.; in short, he is determined by all these factors which provide him with a number of valuations. From them he derives his point of view for envisaging all social facts. It is different with the phenomena which we classify among the "natural sciences." They are all "superior" to man. Man-at least so he believes-can act as he likes. He thinks he is able to direct the conditions of his life just as he wants. Not so in the "natural sciences." There we feel distinctly the great limita- tions of our powers. All we can do with- in their realm is to observe and discover how "nature" works. The classification of sociology among the natural sciences implies the treating of man and human society as a part of nature. This does not necessarily involve disregarding the differ- ence between the physical environment and the particular selection active and inherent in a man's or a people's person- ality. Often, it is true, it is neglected.</page><page sequence="6">i66 SOCIAL FORCES In spite of involving some drawbacks this classification had great advantages for sociology in America in leading it on the path of unbiased observation and registra- tion of facts, even to experimental pro- cedures for obtaining accurate information. The most importanit charge to be made, perhaps, is with regard to the unsophisti- cated attitude towards "facts." A social fact most decidedly is something more complex than a physical fact. We have no senses for the direct registration of social phenomena. We may see or hear a crowd, experience a panic, or observe a number of people working in a field or a factory, and so on. We meet one or two persons; or we talk to parents, to children, to friends. But all these perceptions of the senses indicate very little of the social facts "behind the scenes.'" We need an inter- pretation of a combination of sensual perceptions. And here the trouble begins. The classification of sociology among the "natural sciences" by no means precludes a critical checking of the process of deriv- ing social facts in general, or in any par-. ticular case. On the contrary. The accurateness necessarily associated with applying the methods of the natural sciences involves just such a striving for preciseness. It should be realised that social "facts" are abstractions, and that even their apprehension and initial sub- sumption is blurred by evaluations. Criti- cism of the psychological process of arriving at such "facts" must now begin, and a personal analysis of the individual registering a "fact" be taken into con- sideration. There are, however, degrees in the in- dividual interpretation of "facts.'" Roughly, three different types mnay be distinguished: (i) There are facts which will be inter- preted by all observers in the same way. This type compares with the elementary interpretations of eyesight. It is known that each individual must "learn" how to see. He acquires this faculty in his early youth; but the man born blind accom- plishes this task later in life when he is granted the use of his eyes. Even then it takes him several months. We also gain the understanding of social phe- nomena at a relatively early age by the interpretation of a number of sensual perceptions referring to them. But this understanding is not equally achieved by all people; the variations show more modifications than in the parallel case of eyesight. There are some people with a kind of "blindness" for cognition of social phenomena; there are others also with some "color-blindness." Yet, ex- cept for these anomalies, on the average, most people will agree in the same general interpretations. There will not be much disagreement as to the recognition of a panic, of a revolt, of a strike, of a row, of an assembly, and so on. (z) Dissension may arise, however, from the designation of some measures as "democratic," "socialistic," ''capitalis- tic," etc. According to the party affilia- tion and the emotional attitude of the speaker he may term some measures as "'capitalistic" which his opponent quali- fies as "socialistic," and vice versa. In a similar way oSher political qualifications are subject to considerable non-concur- rence of opinion. A great number of adjectives is used rather carelessly in sociological discussions, such as "intelli- gent," "patriotic," "idealistic," "just," 'nationalistic, "bolshevistic," "aristo- cratic," "peaceful," etc. Their use is by no means so established as to enable a reliable application without further com- ment about the person pronouncing them, and their relation to the conditions designated. (3) "Facts" often receive a peculiar</page><page sequence="7">SOCIOLOGY: ITS CONTENT AND APPLICATION I67 slant by being used in the exposition of a sociological theory or hypothesis. In such cases "composite facts," i.e., some processes or phenomena, are used, but often only a few of their outstanding features, or parts, or connections are given as the whole. This often leads to their distortion. The author is interested in proving his principles. He chooses just this or that "instance" for the sake of "illustration." Here the facts become subservient to the ultimate intentions of the author. In many modern books which want to "prove" a theory, or argue in favor of a political or an economic creed, the "facts" can be seen submerged by the wilful tendency of the propagator. The "facts" which are collected by men devoted to the accurateness of method in the "natural sciences" will certainly never permit themselves to be distorted consci- ously as in the preceding paragraph. But unintended inexactness in the application of qualifying terms, as instanced in point "z," is apt to invalidate some investiga- tions of considerable worth. The need for this type of examination applies also to the mass investigations sometimes conducted on a huge scale. The terms and the language used ought to be weighed carefully. All expressions in modern speech are fraught with connota- tions of times past. Science must polish them for its use. Little or nothing has been done hitherto in this respect in sociology. Other sciences have accom- plished more in evolving their own refined terms. Psychological analysis should take interest in scrutinizing and defining the critical words in questionnaires or records to be statistically treated. Statistical records contain split-off parti- ticles of "facts." Crime, suicide, divorce, marriage, childbirth, etc., are parts of social phenomena, of "composite facts.'" It is very hard to induce from them any "law, as in physics or in cosmic pro- cesses, for the individuality of the case, the time, and the circumstances, are too singular. They move within the same life circle, the same dimensions as we, the oblservers, ourselves. In the face of terres- trial phenomena and cosmic processes the dimensions of our life shrink to nothing; it is their "pulsations" which we interpret as "laws." We cannot do the same with crises of economic conditions, with politi- cal turning points such as wars or revolu- tions, with the resultants of the clash of cultures, and so on. All the cycles pro- posed hitherto have been lacking the exactness with which an eclipse of the sun can be prophesied. Nevertheless, we know that moon and sun did not always move in the same way. The few thousand years of man's recollection do not count in the enourmous stretches of time, but they count immensely with humanity within the human mind. Should we not do better to constitute a class of "human sciences" by themselves? They would include the social and cultural departments, i.e., ethnology and social psychology, and parts of other sciences, dissecting and isolating their connection with sociology. The affiliation with the natural sciences will always provoke the objection that man studying man has to deal with con- ditions different from those when he is concerned with "nature." "But does man not belong to 'nature' ?" is the rebuke of the others. The reply will be, even from those who agree with the reproof, that the equality of dimensions between the observer and the observed create peculiar conditions which must be taken into consideration. These qualifications refer mainly to "ob- jectivity." If we want to proceed exactly as in the natural sciences we have to banish all ambiguity and subjectivity from our</page><page sequence="8">i68 SOCIAL FORCES investigations. Only in this way can we single out the ratio wanted. But has not objectivity been questioned even in phys- ics and in astronomy? Certainly. But in another sense. The subjectivity there refers to general human qualities, to shortcomings of our senses and abilities. The subjectivity found in the social sciences is connected with these deficien- cies also, but in different ways and degrees. This was discussed in part when the manner in which we arrive at social facts was under consideration. We may distinguish three degrees of subjectivity. (i). Most people are im- bued with an almost excessive amount of egocentricity. It is often fully uncon- scious, though all cultures exercise their function in mitigating the most naive and unsocial outbursts of it. There are a hundred conventions of everyday life to repress just the roughest and most perni- cious variants of that egocentricity. The majority of people, whether scientists or not, are utterly unable to dissociate themselves from their interests, from the groups to which they belong or aspire to belong, from the emotions, sentiments, and prejudices which have taken posses- sion of them. Therefore the tendency either to reprimand or to eulogize. This is particularly easy to gratify by theorizing and by speculative constructing. Obser- vation of the methods of the natural sciences shows them to be distinctly averse to such endeavor. In this direction the most ascetic efforts are desirable; a rigid analysis will soon reveal the problem. (2). It is quite possible that a scientist who is aware of his emotions may not be able to conceal them in personal contact, or in a discussion, but will show a well balanced impartiality in his writings. This hints at a considerable amount of "sself-sacrifice." In the turmoil of occur- rences going on around him the sociologist is supposed to be a kind of "thinking device" only, to secure the ratio. Even if he is aware of the hunman shortcomings he cannot fully escape the danger of his own "temperament." This is an attitude entirely different from that described under number "i." Many writers do not at all care to be unbiased. They disguise their inability or unwillingness to strive for less egocentricity under the scholarly cloak of Weltanschauung, a rigid valuation with religious or philosophical "embroid- ery." Their works, often loaded with sentiments and prejudices, usually find more grace with the public than thoseof the careful and "objective" writer who tries to save the ragtio in the social jumble. This indicates the justification of the remarks made above. (3). Whereas in the first case we had to deal with naive egocentricity, in the second one subjectivity is checked by personal deliberations and control. In the third place we shall consider how to solve the problem of egocentricity by methods employed in the natural sciences. Even the author, examining himself for his limitations and restraints is bound by human restrictions. There is only one way to escape subjectivity and egocen- tricity, viz., to view the same subject from different angles of human response. It would imply a result similar to that of observing the same object with two eyes. Thus we obtain the impression of cubical dimensions and of perspective. Convers- ing observations made by various investi- gators of the same social phenomena of processes could eliminate the unavoidable one-sidedness and bias of a one-man observation. Only by this method could the research carried on within the realm of humanity, and by human beings, be brought near to the "objectivity" of the natural sciences. In such manner we would avoid the haphazardness involved</page><page sequence="9">SOCIOLOGY: ITS CONTENT AND APPLICATION I69 in speculative theorizing. The subjec- tivity and egocentricity of different people checking each other could bring out the ratio more distinctly than any other pro- cedure. In this way alone can an accu- mulation of foundation stones for the comprehensive structure of sociology be acquired. To give an example I may refer to an investigation carried out with "objec- tive" methods, Middletown, by the Lynds. It tries tio keep away from interpretations. Critics object precisely to this, saying that what we want is the "'meaning" of all that is going on in Middletown. Such a "'meaning" could be gained in a "super- subjective" way by engaging persons of different "bias" in the task. Application of this technique could be made to politi- cal, national, social questions, and so forth. The investigation of a German town, for instance, by co-nationals of different party affiliations, by a French- man, an Englishman, an American, would bring out a "stereoscopic" image of the social conditions there. Not only this. A comparison would at the same time show the peculiarities of each party and each nation. On the other hand, un- doubtedly, certain common ground would also be covered. This could be considered as the "super-subjective" result. If a native African, a Chinese, a Japanese, a Hindu, etc., could be obtained for the same investigation, the results would probably be diverging still more, and the common ground would be more restricted, but also, consequently, more "objective.'" Such an enterprise could also aid in the mutual understanding between nations and classes. In all these cases the observer requires no less of examination than the object observed. In the natural sciences there are problems not entirely unlike those discussed here. I am referring to the "'anthropomorphic" explanations as we encounter them in the interpretation of animal behavior, and in a score of terms used in chemistry, physics, etc. There is a general human egocentric way of seeing things; in the social sciences the egocentricity is more personal, local, and bound to a particular aggregation and time. All these deliberations may seemn to be far away from any practical objective. They bear at least on the question of method of procedure in sociological work. Later on we shall perceive some practical consequences as well. We may summarize the results obtained so far: (i). Speculative works are to be treated as either naive or intentional egocentric- ity. They may serve as material for the analysis of the writer or his brotherhood, or for the accentuation of one point of view. The latter value may, however, be contested if data are lacking. Specula- tion on "concepts" is valueless if inot checked by realities. (2). The methods used in sociology should approximate as far as possible those of the "'natural sciences" in order to obtain exact and reliable factual material for a constructive theory. This cannot be achieved by a naive acceptance of "facts." (3). The method of the "natural sciences" requires modification when applied to the "human sciences," for the observer and the observed belong to the same dimen- sionality. Criticism of facts may be dis- tinguished according as their nature is either historical or contemporaneous. The sources from which the facts are drawn, both personal and documentary, should be analysed carefully. On the basis of the foregoing, certain criticisms brought against the exact method in sociology, such as is embodied chiefly in the school of recent American</page><page sequence="10">I70 SOCIAL FORCES writers, must be refuted. It has been argued that all sociological work must begin with scientific theories, that it is not worth while if not aimed at the corrob- oration or refutation of a theory. What are the conditions in medicine, in botany, in zo6logy, etc.? Are those sciences swept by theories as is sociology in its speculative phase? By no means. It has been true, for instance, in the case of alchemy, but never since alchemy became "chemistry." Speculative sociology is still in the state of "alchemy." Realistic sociologists want to turn it into "chem- istry.'" Chemistry, and the other sciences cited above, investigate partially because of theories, but in large part they start with the observation of "facts.'" Fact is sometimes more romantic than fiction. Human imagination can never rival that of nature. Observation and recording of social facts comprise a source for socio- logical knowledge far more prolific than the cardboard houses of speculation. It is not only permissible but desirable to start from factual studies without regard to this or that theory. The establishment of a realistic theory of the social processes should not be too much bothered with the hundred and one egocentric hypotheses and speculations. New facts discovered may lead to new theories. "Professional" theory making should be discouraged. Specific investigations must often deal with very minute phenomena. In many sciences it seems that investigations show a disproportion between the machinery employed and the ultimate results. This is the case in the "natural sciences" as well as in history, linguistics, and even in philosophy. It is inherent in all studies occupied with the minutiae of scientific thought. Why should egocentric bluffing prevail in sociology? The use of the word "realistic" does not imply that a study is actually realistic, just as the word "socio- logical" does not guarantee a sociological content. But the factual school will hardly be fooled by mere words. With all necessary caution, however, constructive hypotheses should not be forgotten in the treatment of factual materials, even if the question handled lies somewhat apart and in a very limited field. The exactness and impartiality of the result obtained may confirm its "super- subjectivity." In this way the ratio seems to be nearer at hand. Other reflections upon the factual trend in sociology may be considered. I have suggested, above, more psychological scru- tiny of the observers, and more analytical censure of the expressions used. An example may illustrate what is meant. Our estimation of other clusters of people, however large or small, depends on the interaction of a number of factors each of which deserves attention. (i). There is personal prejudice, based on (a) the opinion prevalent in the social sphere of the observer; (b) his personal "experi- ences," often generalized from one or two events; (c) his opinions drawn from reading books or periodicals; (d) more or less emotional factors associated with what is heard, read, or experienced (which may provoke different reactions in two persons, say twins, if all other factors are constant); (e) the inclination toward rash generalizations, and an uncritical attitude, or the opposite extreme; and (f), misunderstanding of the meaning, or the particular connotation, or a peculiar association of adjectives used, in the words by which valuations are transmitted. (z) The special situation of the observer with regard to the human cluster ought to be considered; for instance, he may be married to a partner belonging to that "cluster," or he may entertain business relations with its representatives. (3). Too close or too manifold an acquaintance with its repre-</page><page sequence="11">SOCIOLOGY: ITS CONTENT AND APPLICATION : sentatives may be as prohibitive in formu- lating an opinion as a too meagre one. A superficial knowledge is generally provo- cative of the distribution of wholesale valuations, for there are always some sources on hand on which to base a generalization. Sociology, furthermore, should not skip over the role personality plays in the composition of social units. The "socio- logistic" schools have too largely ignored the process of interaction between the individuals of a social unit. Even the interaction among various units is often dependent on the leading individuals of those units. This is true of economical and political bodies alike. Very often the existence of a factory or a bank is regulated by its leading officer. Political struggle often turns out to be more largely a battling between a few men than between principles, which are used as a kind of standard. The same is true of small associations such as clubs, societies, and the like. A leading personality acts as its "soul." It would take us too far afield to consider the various forms and functions of leadership, of opposition, of the complementary interaction between leader and "mass," the composition of the "masses," etc.3 Psychological processes accompany every social phenomenon. We cannot interpret any such phenomenon without paying due attention to its psychological background. This, however, must be inferred from personal behavior. It is, of course, admitted, and goes without saying, that such behavior changes accord- ing to its social conditions. This is one point which up to the present has been lacking adequate study. It has been made a point of censure that sociology has been associated with philan- thropic endeavors and enterprises for the " betterment " of social conditions. Sociology, it is argued, should refrain from such work and concentrate upon purely scientific endeavors. As a matter of course, a distinction should be made between the man of thought-the scientist, and the man of action-the politician. This seems all very well in theory. But does not each of the natural sciences also take into consideration practical applica- tions? In physics, in chemistry, in medi- cine, etc., a considerable part of the studies is devoted to practical aims. Of course there is a difference between the man of action trying to "bully" scientific studies, and the scientist occupying himself with problems of practical life. It is just for this reason that the appeal for ratio is made to the scientist. At the same time this factor prescribes our way in sociology. If we want to arrive at any ratio we must try to eliminate egocentric motives as far as possible, shun theories if not borne out by factual material, and concentrate on scientific examination. It is most desirable that sociology devote its atten- tion to contemporary problems. In this way it could become most useful to man- kind. It ought to provide the politician and the statesman with reliable material for his decisions, as physiology and pathology do for the medical practitioner. The scientist is the exact rationalist, the practical man the artist of action. This, however, implies irrationalism. In all our search for a ratio we must not blind ourselves to the irrationalism or super-rationalism with which we are confronted everywhere. It would be an unworthy ratio if it did not take into consideration that "super-rationalism" cutting across the avenues of the ratio. Man's struggle consists in wresting the ratio away from the infinite realm of super- 3 See the author's explanations in the article, "Personality and Society," in Sociology and Social Research, November-December, 1932.</page><page sequence="12">I7T SOCIAL FORCES rationality. Each study of irrationality or super-rationality means a gain of ratio. In practice super-rationality is encoun- tered everywhere. People do not do what is really useful to them, but what they think to be so. In the interactions among men, emotions, sentiments, and prejudices dominate. Sometimes those people be- come leaders who know how to impress the masses by arousing passions-not those who are efficient, but those who seem to be efficient-Mundus vult decipi ("The world wants to be cheated"). Theories in sociol- ogy are accepted not because they conform with the factual conditions, but because they cater to this or that prejudice, wish, fear, or resentment. Mass sentiments rely far more on such emotions than on material conditions, as embodied merely in food, clothing, and housing. The conditions of life of a man or a class may be improved, nevertheless be relatively worse than before, on account of comparison with others, or of prejudices and suggestions injected by propaganda. Why should people be ready to be killed in war? Or die for an "idea"? The actions of men are always based on an inadequate knowledge of the facts. Not only is the statement of "facts" often obscured, as has been pointed out, but numbers of them are largely superficial, gathered from impressions-often by biased people. We are scantily informed about what happens, although our opin- ions are shaped by these impressions, and even by their psychology, just as the observer of a film unconsciously composes a continuous action out of a number of single pictures. It seems that we do not need so many items of information since our "bias" instantly fills in the gaps. This bias, therefore, plays a rather impor- tant role in our ability to construe social processes. This function, however, must be controlled in order to achieve the conquest of some territory from the realm of irrationality. The ratio must always adjust itself to new conditions created by super-rational developments. Foremost among these belong inventions and dis- coveries. According to the conditions created by them the features of social life should ever be adjusting themselves. In order to adapt social life to these con- ditions, inventions and discoveries are needed in the social domain as well. Here also an adequate reclamation of land for ratio must be achieved from the sphere of irrationality. This means that sociology cannot evade the responsibility of occupying itself with practical problems. Hardly any epoch has been confronted with an equal amount of pressing practical problems. How does man solve them? By proclaiming class struggle, by international wars, by impos- ing ideas and things on people who do not want them, by political murder, by deceiv- ing each other about the real conditions, by trying to take advantage of each other through direct or indirect force, etc. There seem to be no factors of importance equal to hate, resentment, cheating, and slander to invoke an aggregation of man. We must not shut our eyes to those sides of humanity, for they are irrational powers of very real importance in social life. They are compensated for by others of which we would rather speak: ideals illusions, phantasies, hallucinations, etc. But we must not moralize. We cannot change human nature. It would imply a great shortcoming in sociology, how- ever, if it should disregard the above factors, as is the case among the followers of the "sociologistic" school who ignore the "human side" of society, and conse- quently its irrationality. If sociology wants to face practical problems it must pay due attention to the irrational element described. The con-</page><page sequence="13">SOCIOLOGY: ITS CONTENT AND APPLICATION I73 temporaneous problems can be summed up in three needs for adaptation, as follows: (i). There is the necessity for institu- tional and mental adaptation to machines, new devices, and acquisitions of knowl- edge, primarily within each common- wealth concerned. Although a great number of studies has been devoted to the "'social questions," as they are termed, our ratio has hitherto been unsuccessful in tackling them. Irrationalism is mani- fested either through the lack of balance of mind among representative thinkers, or through the embarrassment-caused by the obstacles arising from fear, hope, sentiment, prejudice, individual interests, etc.-to the persons responsible for decisive action. (z). Political relations are very little studied from a "super-egocentric" angle. National prejudice is dominant every- where. Pacifistic propaganda has tried to replace national competition by an intensification of class struggle. The war against war is very much more a battling against symbols than against the spirit which is essentially cherished everywhere. The rational solution of emphasizing the complementary qualities of national indi- vidualities is rather thrown aside. Only such complementing of adaptable activi- ties within human society could appease the competing forces. Moreover the irrational factor of self-assertion, over- strained and enhanced by ambnbitious politicians, works against any rational settlement. (3). The expansion of the western world into all parts of the globe, forcing upon the exotic races ideas and objects foreign to their traditions, created an especial need for adaptation among them to the new conditions of life. Many peoples lost their traditional ways of living, of comporting themselves, of thinking, and of evaluating. This produced situations incomparable to any that existed before. The irrational prestige of the European- American has waned since the war, but the psychological impasse of culture and social conditions among the various nations still in the making is even more accentuated. These few topics are not intended to exhaust the scores of practical problems of our time. Their intricacy and entangle- ment with irrational factors is due, among other things, to subconscious attitudes attributable to the continuation of tra- ditional forces even after institutional and acknowledged practices and customs, ancient doctrines and observations have apparently ceased to exist. The United States is involved in the topics just mentioned, though, of course, in a particular way. It is not the task of this paper to review all these subjects in which the collaboration of the social sciences, with their super-subjective stud- ies, would be desirable. American sociol- ogy has never had the attitude that contact with the realities of life contami- nates its hands. But the effectiveness of the ratio has possibly been over-rated. One of the most pressing questions in America is, perhaps, the transition from the period of free development of personality in the times of its colonizing expansion into the conditions of developed industry, with its closed door for immi- grants, and its growing accentuation of state and federal interference-the latter being accompanied by increasing public approval, particularly in the population of the large cities. Whereas state authority seems to be expanding auto- matically, old traditions may still be blocking the progress of this new spirit. The free power of association has always had its counterpart in gangsters. They are nothing new, and not to be ascribed exclusively to prohibition. They seem to</page><page sequence="14">I74 SOCIAL FORCES be a necessary corollary to a mild central state authority. The general lack of social distinction in America restricted the possibility of gaining prestige to the acquisition of money. This was furthered by the spirit of the early pilgrims. It led to various consequences associated with a particular ideology. This is responsible for the special features of American "capi- talism." Its sins led recently to a remark- ably growing radicalism. In the big cities the problems resulting from the enormous accumulation of human beings require asylums and "social clinics" of their own. Perhaps the least pressing problems for the United States lie in the field of inter- national complications. Here, however, the desirable sociological impartiality, as outlined above, could have a beneficent influence on the rest of the world. Per- haps more efficient than a "world court" would be a board of sociologists vying with each other in super-subjectivity. It should not rely on power, which always is corrupting in one way or another, but exclusively on the prestige of unprejudiced opinion. The third point, mentioned above, is full of consequence for America, but in particular respects. The adaptation of immigrants from all parts of the world is a problem of growing importance. Al- though the doors for new immigration are closed, the assimilation is complicated by various factors: (i) the numerical proportion of the immigrants of the last decades in comparison with the old stock; (z) the divergence of traditions brought by the later immigrants from those brought by their predecessors; (3) the impairment by the traditions of home life of educational possibilities among the offspring of the new immigrants. At least, their amalgamation will require some generations. They have to adapt themselves to conditions quite different from those of the first settlers, and seem to be more inclined toward life in the cities. They do not venture so much into farming in the wilderness, not even during the present crisis. Although the Negro population of the United States cannot be included in the process of assimilation with which the immigrants are concerned, it also is con- fronted with the problem of adaptation. Its history and racial peculiarities implies a situation of its own. This is compli- cated by the increasing participation of Negroes in industrial activities in the large cities of the north, and their enlarging educational opportunities resulting in aspirations for the recognition of their individuality. Different again is the situation of the Indian population. Their adaptation is combined with other predicaments. All these studies, and many others not mentioned here, should be treated by practical sociology in a realistic manner. The field of sociology would thereby be extended. Its application to practical life, however, is closely bound up with the enlargement of its scope. American sociology has ever been in favor of keeping up its relation to the situations of con- temporary life. Of course, the special provinces of research ought to maintain a mutual correlation, and their functional interdependence should be investigated along factual lines. The scientist is easily tempted to over- rate the possibilities of the power of ratio and of planning. The politician and statesman, on the other hand, are con- stantly groping in the darkness of irra- tionality. Yet the ratio is the solid foundation, small as it may be, on which to base reliable action. Therefore sociology should battle against all traces of "magical" thinking which obstruct its</page><page sequence="15">SOCIOLOGY: ITS CONTENT AND APPLICATION 175 way. It should analyse concepts into their constituent factors; for example, ''group consciousness," into leadership (suggestion, propaganda, imitation, etc.), and a correlated irrational response by the "masses" (sentiments, prejudices, etc.). Thus it can arrive at an insight into the fabric of "public opinion," "trend of mind,'' and similar phenomena. The "expressionistic" procedures of in- tuitional and speculative "rambling" will be unable to secure any area from the realm of irrationality. Sometimes it has been suggested that a blending of the speculative method (associated with the dominating trend in Germany) and the realistic pro- cedure (ascribed to America) may be desirable. Some exceptions, however, should be noted. I cannot, for instance, see the use of the scholastic discourses with which the speculations are generally embellished. The limited range within which speculations can be of value has been outlined. Philosophical deliberations can be useful within the sphere of criticism, as was pointed out above. The "deepen- ing" of social investigations will be derived chiefly from psychological analysis (not "psychoanalysis" of any school). Behavioristic methods alone are certainly of limited bearing, but they provide the skeleton. This ought to be vitalized by analytical reflections in order to arrive at psychological interpretations of the social processes. The empirical and experimen- tal methods, of course, cannot forever evade the construction of theories, such as has been done in the other sciences. They are needed, but a hypertrophy of them is certainly detrimental. There will come a time when people will read with a smile of the sociological " 'witch doctors" and "alchemists" who theorized without factual foundations. The future of sociology undoubtedly lies in factual studies. If carried on by critical minds and with sincere and broadminded super-subjectivity it can be made useful for the best of human affairs. The alert eagerness to understand and help should supersede likes and dislikes in the common conquest of ratio. Of course, we shall always "bump up" against the powers of irrationality. The regulation of social processes can be con- trolled by man far less than is often believed; this is increasingly true the more social phenomena appear to be phenomena of "nature" and subject to the methods of the "natural sciences." In our double role as actors and spectators in the human drama, however, we try to use our ratio for conduct and understanding just as well as we are qualified to afford it.</page></plain_text>
