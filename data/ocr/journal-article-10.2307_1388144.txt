<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cognitive Constraints on Hindu Concepts of the Divine JUSTIN L. BARRETTT Concepts of gods, like any other concepts, are informed and constrained by cross-cultural regularities of the human mind-brain. Specifically, divine beings that are represented as intentional agents are subject to the cognitive intuitions that govern all intentional agents. These intuitions may include psychological and physical attributes not endorsed by a given theological tradition. Experimental evidence is presented supporting the presence of these cognitive constraints and a resulting divergence between stated theolo- gical beliefs and implicit concepts. Hindu residents of northern India completed questionnaires regarding attributes of Brahman, Shiva, Vishnu, or Krishna and also participated in a narrative comprehension task. Results revealed striking differences in how the gods were conceived in the two contexts. Theoretical developments in the scientific study of religion during the 1990s have been distinguished by the growing influence of cognitive science. As Stewart Guthrie remarked in 1996, "New efforts at producing a general theory [of religion] have appeared. Although these range from irrationalist, wishful-thinking theories to rationalist and linguistic ones, they increasingly emphasize cognition" (412). This swell of theoretical work only serves to magnify the paucity of empirical scholarship using cognitive methods and insights to address issues in the study of theistic and other cultural systems. The present project addresses this evidential shortcoming by examining the general question of how cognitive architecture informs and constrains con- ceptualizations of the Divine. In brief, as with any other concept, concepts of gods must largely conform to the undergirding cognitive intuitive assumptions universally held for the ontological category of gods. Since gods are typicaUy understood as intentional agents, they must satisfy the (often) tacit assumptions of agenthood.1 COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVES What many cognitive perspectives have in common is that they see cultural repre- sentations, such as religious concepts, merely as widespread instances of individually held cognitive representations - therefore subject to cognitive constraints of the human mind- brain (Sperber 1995). Representations of the properties and actions of religious agents is the same as for natural agents with a few minor adjustments (Lawson and McCauley 1990). Simply, when it comes to thinking about a divine agent, not just anything goes. Like other concepts, concepts of gods and other nonhuman agents must be amenable to human processing limitations. The question is, which limitations are relevant? While simple memory and attentional limitations undoubtedly play a role in selecting which cultural concepts exist (e.g., a 43-digit number is hard to remember and pass on), the type of cognitive constraint most frequently cited in discussions of religious ideas is that of conceptual expectations. The mind organizes the world into various hierarchically related concepts and builds up a base of intuitive expectations for things represented by those con- ' Jutstin L.

These intuitive expectations guide how information in the world is processed, remem- bered, interpreted, and produced (Keil 1979, 1989). This cognitive perspective is illustrated by the two leading theories of concepts of divine beings: Guthrie's perceptual schema theory (1993) and Boyer's cognitive optimum theory (1994). These theories account for slightly different phenomena in importantly divergent ways but are presented below because of their similar predictions regarding concepts of gods. Guthrie's Perceptual Schema Theory In contemporary scholarship, the importance of anthropomorphism in understanding theistic beliefs has been championed by Guthrie (1980, 1993). Like Freud's "humanization of nature" (1927: 20), Guthrie sees gods as springing from anthropomorphism of the natural world. Unlike Freud, Guthrie sees theistic belief systems as the consequence of an adaptive perceptual strategy, not an attempt to ease feelings of helplessness. Rather than anthropomorphism occupying a peripheral place in religion, religion is anthropomorphism, according to Guthrie. Religion and, by implication, gods are the result of people trying to best make sense of the world by assuming the world is structured by humanlike intentional agency. Guthrie argues that since our world and existence are ambiguous and confusing, they are in need of interpretation. The most efficient interpretation scheme is to "gamble" on those possible scenarios that are most important for survival, safety, procreation, food procurement, and such. The most important possible interpretation of any given event, a priori, is that it involves another human or another intentional agent, since other humans pose both the greatest competition and the greatest opportunities for survival and repro- duction. Humans have, therefore, evolved a perceptual strategy or heuristic that assumes "it is a human" unless proven otherwise. Guthrie makes the case for a universal bias to see human influence in the world by citing ethnographic data of three basic types. First, around the world, peoples believe in humanlike spirits, demons, and gods. Second, people tend easily to attribute human proper- ties to nonhuman things, that is, anthropomorphize, as when artists, architects, and adver- tisers use human features in designs. Third, people are prone to mistake ambiguous sights or sounds as either human or the result of human or intentional activity. These errors can be simple perceptual mistakes as in thinking that the wiid in the trees sounds like a voice, or can be higher level interpretive schemes as when the spatial relationship of stars and planets communicates a message. A growing body of experimental research also supports the idea that people are prone to interpret the world in anthropomorphic terms. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the basic phenomena. In Heider and Simmel's now famous experiment (1944), adult sub- jects described the movement of two-dimensional geometric shapes in terms of intentional behavior, social interactions, and even gender roles. Recent follow-up studies with children and adults suggest that the anthropomorphism in this task is triggered merely by contin- gent patterns of movement (Berry et al. 1992; Berry and Springer 1993). In another experiment, when asked if various animals could engage in specific cognitive tasks or experience the world like humans, college students tended to expect more humanlike cognition of animals with which they have had more "social" interaction (dogs and cats) than other mammals, except primates which have more physical similarities with humans (Eddy, Gallup, and Povinelli 1993). Inagaki and Hatano (1987) found that kindergartners were prone to overextend human traits to rabbits and tulips when asked to reason about attributes not immediately observable. Though the various experiments on anthropo- morphism have not yet been theoretically integrated, they do provide compelling evidence that humans can and do anthropomorphize easily.</page><page sequence="3">610 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Because the anthropomorphism Guthrie describes is evident both in perceiving physical stimuli and in interpreting configurations and events, it might be predicted that people who hold a religious worldview will attribute to gods physical, biological, and psycho- logical humanlike properties. Boyer's Cognitive Optimum Theorv Boyer's theory draws heavily from the work of psychologists in the subfield of concepts and conceptual structure (Boyer 1994). For any concept, such as "cat," "car," or "rock,"~ people hold a host of intuitive assumptions about its properties. These assumptions, in turn, are the consequence of a host of "theories' that govern the concept's ontology. For example, because a cat is a living thing, our intuitive or folk biology applies to cats and we tacitly assume that cats have nutritional needs and will eventually die. These are two properties of "cat" that need not be explicitly represented. Likewise, because a cat is a vertebrate, we expect cats to move purposefully to fulfill their needs. Once we code a thing as a cat, there is no need to further note to ourselves, "Oh, yes, and cats can move." A cat is also a physical object and as such, intuitive physical assumptions are triggered as well. These intuitive assumptions provide the basic structure to concepts. Boyer refers to these structures as "causal schemata' (ibid.). Many, if not all, of the expectations and intuitions generated by these casual schemata appear to be in place already by early childhood. A growing wealth of experiments supports the suggestion that preschool-aged children have a "naive' or "intuitive" understanding of physics, biology, and psychology. For example, in the domain of "naive physics," children as young as 4 months seem already to expect (at least in some situations) that solid objects move in continuous paths (principle of continuity) and do not pass through other solid objects (principle of solidity) (Baillargeon 1987; Baillargeon and Hanko-Summers 1990). In biological reasoning, preschoolers have been found to have some understanding that while artifacts may be transformed into other artifacts, membership in a biological category depends upon unseen properties that cannot be easily changed (Keil 1986). Further, 4-year- olds can successfully override irrelevant physical similarities when projecting biological properties, such as knowing that sharks breathe like tropical fish and not like dolphins, simply because sharks are a type of fish (Gelman and Markman 1986). Psychologically, 3- and 4-year-olds have some appreciation that people behave based on beliefs and desires, and that the fulfillment or frustration of desires leads to positive or negative emotional states (Perner 1995). These domains of "naive" knowledge constitute the majority of inferences which compose causal schemata. A concept may also possess many other features not automatically assumed by the causal schemata. Returning to the cat, a cat might be aggressive, playful, and agile, as well as a purposeful, moving thing. These additional features must be attached more explicitly to the concept, for they are not natural consequences of the causal theories that govern a cat's ontology. Boyer terms these features as "nonschematic" features. Because they are not intuitive implications of "cat," they are also less likely to be true. Since schematic and nonschematic features of concepts are cognitive regularities, they apply to all concepts, even "religious" ones. What distinguishes religious concepts from other concepts, asserts Boyer, is that religious concepts possess nonschematic features that violate the causal schemata of the concept. For example, under Boyer's definition, a cat that can never die is a religious concept because the property 'can never die" violates our intuitive theories about what it means to be a living thing, and "cat" designates a living thing. Boyer goes on to say, as has been argued elsewhere (Sperber 1994), that it is these counterintuitive properties that make religious concepts salient. Increased salience, in turn, enhances the likelihood that the concept will be remembered and passed on.</page><page sequence="4">COGNITIVE CONSTRAINTS ON HINDU CONCEPTS OF DIVINE 611 Does this suggest that the more counterintuitive features a concept has, the better? No. Too many counterintuitive features would undermine the structure of the concept. Its relations to relevant causal theories would be disrupted. A cat that can never die, has wings, is made of steel, experiences time backwards, lives underwater, and speaks Russian would no longer be much of a cat. Consequently, the causal schemata would no longer gen- erate sensible intuitive assumptions, and so there would be no counterintuitive properties. For now, it suffices to note that what Boyer proposes is a cognitive optimum: a balance between satisfying ontologically driven intuitive assumptions and violating enough of them to produce a salient concept. These relatively simple observations do a great deal of work when applied to the problem of the transmission and recurrence of religious concepts. To illustrate, the concept "ghost" appears in many different cultures. Ghosts are a nonphysical aspect of a person who survives death and continues to function much like an ordinary person: They have beliefs and desires that motivate behavior, they can see and hear, they can communicate, and so on. They differ from humans in their physical properties. They are intangible and able to pass through solid objects. That all ghosts tend to have these common properties can be readily addressed with Boyer's theory. Ontologically, ghosts are best categorized as persons or sentient beings, just like humans. Like humans, they possess all the intuitive assump- tions of sentient beings like having beliefs and desires that motivate behavior. These intuitive assumptions need not be explicitly transmitted. Once ghosts are recognized as humanlike, the causal schema is carried along as baggage. Only the nonstandard (i.e., intuitive assumption violating) property of not having a physical body needs to be explicitly represented and transmitted. Many other nonstandard properties are rarely attributed to ghosts because too many nonstandards would begin to degrade the conceptual structure. Turning to concepts of divinity, once a god is assigned to an ontological category, a concept of that god must conform to the majority of expectations on that category's membership. Under Boyer's ontological scheme, gods fall most reasonably in the category of "persons," the same ontological node occupied by humans. As persons, gods must conform to the bulk of properties to which humans are expected to conform as well. Consequently, gods are cognitively pressured to be anthropomorphic with regard to psychological, biological, and physical properties, but will also minimally deviate on some properties. Though differing on many other counts, both Guthrie's and Boyer's theories predict intuitive and automatic anthropomorphism of gods with regard to psychological, biological, and physical properties.2 That is, they predict gods will be tacitly attributed a constellation of properties that humans possess but which gods, in their theological clothing, do not typically share. These include psychological properties that are often considered distinc- tively human, such as use of language, a belief-desire calculus for directing behavior, and emotions, as well as biological properties that humans share with other animals and physical properties that humans share with other bounded, solid objects. A failure to docu- ment these attributions would undermine both cognitive theories. PREVIOUS RESEARCH In one of the most well-known studies of children's ideas of God, using drawings of God, interviews, letters, and other measures, Heller (1986) investigated concepts held by Michigan children mostly ranging in age from 5 to 10 from many different faith traditions. One prominent finding was that children tended to think of God as a superhuman and not the formless, intangible, omniscient, and omnipotent being their theologies taught. Similarly, Mudge (1923) reported that 77% of 6- to 14-year-olds he interviewed had visual, anthropomorphic imagery of God. Many other studies asking children to draw pictures of God also found that God was frequently represented anthropomorphically (e.g., Goodnow</page><page sequence="5">612 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION 1977; Harms 1944; Harris 1963; Pitts 1976). But as Hyde (1990) points out, the use of drawings "to probe ideas of God assumes visual thinking in anthropomorphic terms" (75). Indeed, the pervasiveness of the assumption that children have anthropomorphic concepts of God has led to little criticism of methods such as drawing pictures that clearly bias children to produce concrete illustrations of God. Likewise, anthropomorphism is considered such an obvious and predictable feature of children's concepts of God that the reason children anthropomorphize and the role anthropomorphism plays in their understanding of God have been largely ignored. In adulthood, evidence of anthropomorphism from psychological literature comes almost exclusively from the attribution of personality traits, dispositions, and emotions to God. The independent variables in these correlational studies tend to be the subjects' own personality traits, current emotional states, clinical conditions, and personal or family histories. For example, it has been found that self-esteem and loving images of God (Benson and Spilka 1973), locus of control and loving images of God (deJonge 1993), and loneliness and a 'wrathful God" concept are correlated (Schwab and Petersen 1990). These studies provide evidence that God is attributed personality traits; however, they fall short of evidence for full-fledged anthropomorphism. Being loving and being wrathful are certainly human qualities, but it is unclear that these are exclusively human qualities. To jump to this conclusion is anthropocentric. God might have possessed the property of being loving earlier (and better) than humans, and so humans being loving would be evidence of theomorphism.3 Psychological evidence for fundamental anthropomorphism, that is, automatic and implicit attribution of humanlike physical, biological, and psychological properties, which Boyer and Guthrie demand, is scarce in studies of adults in the Abrahamic West, because traditional measures used to address God concepts do not properly tap implicit cognitive structures. An adequate cognitive measure of God concepts must avoid two problems common in traditional measures. First, individual concepts of God are subject to social conformity and orthodoxy pressures. If adults are asked whether God possesses a physical body like a humans, the answer will be no, even if God is imagined as a bearded old man sitting on a throne in the clouds, simply because this image of God is not orthodox and is associated with juvenile thinking. Consequently, direct-report measures of God concepts are suspect with regard to unorthodox properties. A second but related problem that an ade- quate cognitive measure must avoid is emphasizing explicit concepts instead of implicit assumptions but remaining consistently interpretable. Evidence of implicit, often tacit, anthropomorphic assumptions in reasoning about God is required to support cognitive theories because it is these types of concepts that organize on-line information processing, structure memory organization, generate inferences, allow categorization of novel things, and facilitate structured imagination (Sperber, Premack, and Premack 1995; Ward 1995). Explicitly held ideas about various things, such as God, may only represent a list of rehearsed, nonintegrated attributes, and have no causal efficacy. One recently published set of experiments by Barrett and Keil (1996) provides both an appropriate cognitive measure and evidence supporting fundamental anthropomorphism of God concepts among American university students: a narrative comprehension measure.4 In contrast to participants' narrative comprehension data, when explicitly asked whether or not God has similar properties using a questionnaire, they rejected the anthropomorphic attributes. Barrett and Keil interpreted these differences in results as evidence of cognitive pressure for God to conform to intuitive assumptions of an intentional agent concept: When there is little processing demand, as in a direct-response question- naire, people may use their more cognitively cumbersome, theologically correct concept of God. But when processing demands are increased, God is treated like any other agent, having natural limitations.</page><page sequence="6">COGNITIVE CONSTRAINTS ON HINDU CONCEPTS OF DIVINE 613 Barrett and Keil's reasoning was that if nonanthropomorphic theological God concepts are used in basic conceptual activities, then subjects' reported theological concepts regarding God's properties should have matched the God concept revealed by how subjects remember short narratives - a conceptual activity. Alternatively, subjects' theological God concepts placed few if any physical or psychological constraints on God, but in the pro- cessing of stories, limitations on God similar to those experienced by people and other natural entities were imposed. To illustrate this distinction, one story read: A boy was swimming alone in a swift and rocky river. The boy got his left leg caught between two large, gray rocks and couldn't get out. Branches of trees kept bumping into him as they hurried past. He thought he was going to drown and so he began to struggle and pray. Though God was answering another prayer in another part of the world when the boy started praying, before long God responded by pushing one of the rocks so the boy could get his leg out. The boy struggled to the river bank and fell over exhausted. Subjects whose basic, intuitive God concept is anthropomorphic might infer that God finished answering one prayer before attending to the boy. If so, they would tend to mis- report that this is actually what the story said. Subjects who employ a God concept in which God performs many tasks simultaneously would be unlikely to report that the story said God finished answering one prayer before saving the boy. It is just as likely that God rescued the boy while answering the other prayer. To further illustrate the logic, in one story from Barrett and Keil (1996), a woman gets lost in a cave and begins to pray. It is evidence of the concept "women are prone to cry when frightened" to misremember that the woman indeed cried when she was lost, though the story never states this, even though it is possible for a woman to cry in this situation. Likewise, even though an omnipotent God may take on human limitations (e.g, incar- nations), it is evidence of anthropomorphism for subjects to misremember these human attributes as being included in a story when they were not, in fact, present. While the detected distinction between basic concepts of God used in narrative comprehension and theological concepts used in answering questionnaire items is sugges- tive, the findings might have been prompted by cultural, not psychological, factors. Perhaps differences between results of the questionnaire and performance on the narrative compre- hension task were due to the participants simply not being adept at thinking about God in real-time discourse. After all, in much of American society, thoughts of God might be confined to Sunday's theological reflections and not integrated into everyday life. On the other hand, pressures to hold an orthodox view of God may unnecessarily push question- naire responses away from anthropomorphism. In any case, a replication of these data in a markedly different cultural setting is necessary before drawing any strong conclusions. To this end, a version of the written narrative comprehension task used by Barrett and Keil, along with a survey of what properties are attributed to God, was administered to Hindus in northern India. This population was selected because in devotional Hinduism, much as in the Abrahamic theisms, ultimately God (i.e., the Ultimate Being) is considered completely formless and nonanthropomorphic, but various forms of God are widely described in varying degrees of anthropomorphism. In fact, anthropomorphism is embraced rather than viewed with suspicion (Mukherji 1947; Eck 1985). It might be expected that various degrees of anthropomorphism attributed to specific forms of God in Hindu theology would lead to different degrees of anthropomorphism as measured by a survey and as measured by the narrative comprehension task. Specifically, Brahman, the formless God, should show little anthropomorphism, while Krishna, an incarnation or actual human should show much anthropomorphism. Vishnu and Shiva, two forms of Brahman frequently depicted in human forms would be expected to fall somewhere in between.</page><page sequence="7">614 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION METHOD Subjects. Participants were 50 Indians, 47 Hindu and 3 Muslim. Ages ranged from 9 to 55 years with a mean age of 25.4 years. Fourteen were younger than 20; eight were 30 to 39; and 14 were older than 39 years. Twenty-foui were female; 19 were male; and seven did not list their sex. Participants were recruited from schools and neighborhoods in Delhi and Jaipur, India, yielding a large range of educational attainment. While being able to read English was a prerequisite for the study - and English skills have a strong correlation with education - some subjects had as few as two years of schooling and others as many as 21. The vast majority of subjects spoke Hindi as their first language.5 Materials. A written version of five of the eight stories used in Barrett and Keil's Experiment 2 were prepared in one random order. These five stories were followed by either eight or nine recall items, totaling 42 items: 26 control items concerned with the basic facts of the story, and 16 "God" items concerned with how the particular form of God was conceptualized. The two God items for the story given above are "Krishna had just finished answering another prayer when Krishna helped the boy" and "Krishna went to the boy in response to the boy's prayer for help." Two control items from this story were "The boy got his left arm caught between two rocks" and "Krishna responded to the boy's prayer by pushing a rock." (While this second control item includes Krishna, it does not test any potentially anthropomorphic assumptions and so is a control item.) Because this protocol relies on mistaken comprehension, all God items included information not in the stories but suggesting particular dimensions of an anthropomorphic concept (e.g., sequential agency or mobility as in the God items given above). "Yes" answers on these items at a rate exceeding chance error (as estimated by each subjects' control item accuracy) was considered evidence for the attribution of particular property to God that was not expressed in the story, even if an omnipotent God could exhibit some of these properties. The possibility of behaving in a certain way does not entail that the behavior or particular property was exhibited in the story. These properties included God's moving, being in a particular place, requiring sensory input to gather information, performing only one task at a time, having a single focus of attention, having sensory limitations, and being unable to process competing sensory stimuli distinctly. To illustrate, it is an anthropomorphic assumption to infer that when a herd of cattle pass over a rock on a road, God cannot see the rock. Accuracy on God items was contrasted with accuracy on control items so that subjects who simply have a bad memory or poor comprehension were not mistakenly identi- fied as anthropomorphizers, Four different versions were prepared, each with a different form of the Hindu Supreme Being: Brahman - the formless God; Shiva and Vishnu - two forms of Brahman frequently depicted in anthropomorphic images; and Krishna - an avatar or incarnation of Vishnu who was actually human and is depicted in human form. Likewise, four versions of a 15-item survey asking subjects to rate on a four-point scale their degree of agreement with different attributes of God were prepared. The points of the scale were "strongly agree," "agree," "disagree," and "strongly disagree." The survey also asked for age, sex, faith tradition, and years of schooling. The narrative comprehension form and the survey form were paired so that each subject was asked only about one form of the Divine. Subjects were asked to fill out the narrative comprehension form completely and then complete the survey.6 Procedure. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four groups resulting in irnbalanced group sizes. There were 7 in the Shiva group, 12 in the Vishnu group, 14 in the Brahman group, and 17 in the Krishna group. Subjects were asked to read the five narra- tives using their own conception of the god in question and answer the recall items. Subjects were allowed to work at their own pace.7</page><page sequence="8">COGNITIVE CONSTRAINTS ON HINDU CONCEPTS OF DIVINE 615 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION No differences between groups were found on the survey measure. Likewise, no group differences were detected on the narrative comprehension task or for any interactions either; so all subjects were treated as one group for the following analyses.8 Though there was a fair amount of variation in responses to the questionnaire items (especially on items regarding biological properties), there was still an overwhelming tendency to reject anthropomorphic properties of the gods. Subjects agreed that all forms of Brahman can do anything, know everything, can perform multiple mental activities at the same time, see everything, hear everything and have non-natural spatial properties. Table 1 summarizes the results of the questionnaire. TABLE 1 QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS: MEAN SCORE FOR EACH ITEM. 1. Vishnu has a solid, physical body 2.71 2.

A score of 1 indicates strong agreement with an anthropomorphic property. A score of 4 indicates strong disagreement. A mean score of greater than 2.5 was interpreted as rejection of the anthropomorphic property suggested. 'ishnu" was replaced by other names in the appropriate forms. Items were scored on a scale of 1 to 4 for how much they rejected an anthropomorphic attribute. A score of 1 indicated anthropomorphism. Averaging across all 15 items for each subject, a score less than 2.5 would indicate a general tendency to anthropomorphize. Of the 50 subjects, only 10 showed this tendency. Thirty-nine averaged greater than 2.5, and one averaged exactly 2.5. This difference is significant, p &lt; .001 (sign test). Similarly, sign tests based on the number of subjects per item who answered either on the anthropomorphic or the nonanthropomorphic side of the scale revealed that all but three items (1, 2, and 5) had significantly more nonanthropomorphic responses. No items had more anthropomorphic responses. This tendency to disagree with anthropomorphic properties of the gods sharply contrasted with performance on the narrative comprehension task. Much as in Barrett and Keil's experiments, responses indicated a high degree of anthropomorphism in concepts of the gods. Subjects were accurate on God items only 38.1% on average (SD = .209), compared to 81. 1% on control items (SD = .139), t(49) = 12.874, p &lt; .000 1 (paired t-test). This indicated that subjects mistakenly remembered particular anthropomorphic properties being attri- buted to the gods in the stories at a far greater rate than errors on control items. For example, subjects were much more inclined to misremember a story as reporting Vishnu moving from place to place (even though on the questionnaire it was reported that Vishnu could be in more than one place at a time), than to misremember a woman crying when she discovered she was lost in a cave.</page><page sequence="9">616 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC S1IDY OF RELIGION In this task, subjects often misremembered the narratives as including attributes that were humanlike properties. Subjects apparently used anthropomorphic concepts to process and remember the stories, even though these concepts did not agree with the explicit char- acterizations of the gods implied by answers on the questionnaire. Specifically, subjects seemed to characterize the gods as having to be near something to receive sensory infor- mation from it, not being able to attend differentially to competing sensory stimuli, per- forming tasks sequentially and not in parallel, having a single or limited focus of attention, moving from place to place, and sometimes standing or walking. The gods were not con- ceptualized as completely free of constraints nor similar to the characterizations given on the questionnaires. Further, the anthropomorphic performance on the narrative comprehension task appears independent of answers on the survey. The difference between God item accuracy and control item accuracy is uncorrelated with a composite anthropomorphism score on the survey (average of all 15 items). A simple regression detected no significant relationship (t(48 ) = 1.653, p = .105) but a trend in the opposite direction of what might be expected (r = .232). Subjects who were less anthropomorphic on the survey, tended to show a greater disparity between God item and control item accuracy suggesting more anthropomorphism in the basic concept of the god. However, this trend disappears when age is added to the regression model. Age was found to be related to anthropomorphism in two ways. First, a simple linear regression found that age had a positive relationship with the difference between God item and control item accuracy, t(48) = 2.608, p = .012. Older subjects tended to show more evidence of anthropomorphism on the narrative comprehension task. This relationship was apparent even when factoring out education. Second, older subjects tended to give less anthropomorphic responses on the survey, t(48) = 3.487, p = .001. Again, this relationship still exists after controlling for the effect of education. Taken together these two results suggest a growing disparity between stated beliefs about attributes of the gods and the properties that seem to be assumed when performing the narrative comprehension task. Intuitively, this is sensible: As one ages, one becomes more attuned to social expectations and orthodoxy in theological concepts, but one only becomes more fluent in reasoning about the gods anthropomorphically with greater total exposure to images and mythology, and with overlearning of properties of human agency. However, given that this study has a restricted age range, and may mask important cohort effects, interpretations must be made tentatively. CONCLUSIONS At least occasionally, people apparently use anthropomorphic concepts of God in understanding stories even though they may profess a theological position that rejects anthropomorphic constraints on God and God's activities, suggesting that God, and perhaps other religious objects and entities, are conceptualized on at least two different levels: the basic, everyday concept used in real-time processing of information, and the theological level used in discussion of God's properties or activities outside of on-line, real-time processing demands. As was shown above, these two levels of conceptualization may represent God in substantially different ways. The basic concept appears to be anthropomorphic, having many physical and psychological properties of humans. The theological concept attributes to God a wholly different mode of existence than humans and is decidedly not anthro- pomorphic.9 For many people, the theological concept might not be a full-blown concept in the sense of providing a set of causal relations between various features of God, that generate predictions, explanations, and inferences. Theologically, God might be represented as either</page><page sequence="10">COGNITIVE CONSTRAINTS ON HINDU CONCEPTS OF DIVINE 617 a list of decontextualized properties like omniscient, omnipotent, loving, etc., or be represented as a set of conditional attributes: If the context is A, God is W and X; if the context is B, God has properties Y and Z. In either case, a robust, developed concept of God is not available. Another possibility is that for many people the theological concept simply represents a cognitively assisted version of the basic concept. "Cognitively assisted" means that through analysis, discussion, and writing over thousands of years, many features have been abstracted out of concrete situations and been made salient. These mostly non-natural properties are not the cognitive burden on transmission that Boyer's theory predicts because of enormous rehearsal and the assistance of written texts. Further, representation of these cognitively more difficult properties is facilitated by using them outside of any real-time demands. The theological concept, while being a true concept, might be more fragile than the basic concept and only successful at producing inferences, explanations, and predictions in slowed down situations with simplified contextual variables, as when reflecting on how a certain understanding of God bears on one's goals and aspirations. The relationship between these two "levels" of representing attributes of the Divine parallels scientific thought. While a scientifically educated person knows that the earth revolves around the sun, this understanding does not easily produce real-time inferences. Rather, even knowing full well that the sun does not revolve around the earth, we use this mistaken relationship to generate predictions about the position of the sun throughout the day. The scientifically inaccurate representation produces more useful inferences in everyday life. The same is true of folk notions of physics and time versus scientific counterparts. More importantly, the data presented, together with Barrett and Keil's (1996), provide the evidence of anthropomorphism in basic concepts of divine beings that Guthrie's and Boyer's theories anticipate. To organize and understand information about gods in real- time, on-line tasks such as comprehending a narrative, people rely on an agent concept that is anthropomorphic, at least with regard to many physical and psychological properties. The intuitive expectations of the mind constrain how divine beings are represented, even if these constraints contradict professed theological beliefs. That gods are given human properties does not imply that these attributions are due to cognitively coding gods as "humans" or "persons" as Boyer's theory might suggest; nor does it imply that people are biased to interpret ambiguous stimuli as "humanlike" as Guthrie's theory predicts. The same results could be explained in terms of a more general intuition-generator that operates on all intentional agents. Since gods and humans are intentional agents, they will be expected to conform to similar psychological and physical assumptions. If this is the case, what has been documented is not "anthropomorphism" at all. Regardless of the underlying cognitive mechanism, the data presented above provide strong evidence of important cross-cultural constraints on how divine beings are repre- sented. As with "natural" concepts, when it comes to thinking about the supernatural, not just anything goes.

For this paper, "God" designates religious traditions' ultimate beings since this is the most common English</page><page sequence="11">618 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION label for the ultimate being in the Judeo-Christian traditions and in modern Hinduism. Most psychological research on concepts of the divine have focused on the Judeo-Christian 'God." Consequently, this area of research is referred to as the study of God concepts. This jargon is retained here. 2 Some kind of humanlike attributions are also anticipated by Lawson and McCauley's theory of religious rituals (1990). They argue that intuitions regarding religious rituals such as whether or not they are well-formed, efficacious, reversible with another ritual, or repeatable in subsequent rituals are merely a function of regularities in how action is cognitively represented. Actions that involve superhuman agents, such as religious rituals, are represented much like mundane actions. This suggests beliefs and desires are expected to motivate the behaviors of superhuman agents much as they do in human agents. 3This error lurks in many atheistic discussions of anthropomorphism, like Freud's (1927) and, I believe, Guthrie's (1993). Because God is assumed to not exist, of course when properties that humans possess are attributed to God, it is clearly anthropomorphism. A nonexistent God only has the property of "nonexistence" until it is filled in with human properties. A more sensible treatment of anthropomorphism remains agnostic about God's existence and properties and only treats as strong evidence of anthropomorphism those properties shared with humans that are attributed to God in some contexts but not in others. I assume that, as when discussing cognitive representations of natural concepts, it is important to distinguish between God's actual properties and God's attributed or represented properties. 4 This method was also used by Barrett and VanOrman (1996) to measure differences in anthropomorphism between Catholic and Protestant college students. 5 Subjects were recruited with the aid of native Indians living in the cities from which subjects were drawn. No clear second-language problems were detected since the subjects were accustomed to reading and writing in English. Control item accuracy was comparable to that of Barrett's and Keil's (1996) subjects who were Cornell University students. 6 Complete materials may be obtained by writing the author. 7 Barrett and Keil demonstrated in Experiments 2 and 3 (1996) that cognitive expectations are so strong that subjects will make mistakes about the content of a narrative, inferring anthropomorphic properties where none are included, even when the narrative is available for examination. Subjects also made these errors in paraphrasing the stories. 8 The small number of subjects in each group (and poor statistical power) undoubtedly contributed to the failure to detect any differences between groups. However, the trends represented by the group means did not even vaguely suggest any hypothesized differences. For example, the Krishna group showed slightly more rejection of anthropomorphism than the Brahman group on the questionnaire, a mean score of 3.00 versus 2.87 - exactly opposite of predicted. 9 The distinction between theological concepts and basic concepts of God is important for selecting appropriate methodologies. Since the theological concept is more explicit and likely to be developed and used in social contexts, it may be especially subject to demand characteristics, social influence, and overlearned behavioral schemas. When asked to explicitly specify God's attributes, most people will feel some pressure to give what they perceive to be an orthodox response. In mainstream Christianity, God would be characterized nonanthropomorphically, even if respondents maintain basic concepts that are anthropomorphic. This phenomena may be termed "theological correctness.' REFERENCES Baillargeon, Renee. 1987. Young infant's reasoning about the physical and spatial characteristics of a hidden object.
