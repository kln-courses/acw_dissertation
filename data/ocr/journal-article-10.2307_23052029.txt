<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIEWS &amp; REVIEWS REVIEW OF THE WEEK Primates at the pictures A blockbuster film incorporates the themes of Alzheimer's disease and biomedical ethics, says Desmond O'Neill Rise of the Planet of the Apes Directed by Rupert Wyatt Rating: *** Project Nim Directed by lames March Rating: Summer blockbuster films usually have large visual impact, a quick surge of gratification, but little by way of lasting fulfilment. Occasionally, however, they provide a bit more. Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the latest iteration and pre quel to the Planet of the Apes saga, is definitely in the latter category. Hugely entertaining and well constructed, it is also layered with contem porary themes that add piquancy for medical viewers. These include Alzheimer's disease, primate research, pandemics, research ethics, and the distortions created by the medical industrial complex. Interestingly, this medical flavour parallels the original 1968 film, which starred a very skilled ape surgeon called Galen and in which lobotomy featured as an instru ment of both control and punishment. The plot centres on a cognitive enhancer with untoward side effects. These unravel when the flawed hero, a research neuroscientist, breaks several ethical barriers. He treats his own father in secret and without formal clinical trials having occurred, and he hides a baby chimp destined for destruction as a pet in his home. Corporate greed and ethical blindness amplify the consequences, and the rollercoaster of action gathers momentum. In a very modern trend, started by the Marvel action hero movies, you need to stay for the credits at the end to get the full story. It is a telling tribute to the sopistication of computer generated (or enhanced) imagery that the most affecting character in the film is the cognitively enhanced chimpanzee Caesar, "played" by the Brit ish actor Andy Serkis with a subtle mixture of quietude and passion. Ironically, the other most memorable character is the scientist's father (played by John Lithgow), who is affected by Alzheimer's disease. The mirrors to contemporary anxieties and public awareness in the film are telling. As a geriatrician, I was struck by how casually the protagonists tossed about the term "cogni tive function": would that colleagues in other disciplines and trainees of all hues showed as much awareness of it in their dealings with older patients. It is a signal marker of how far the awareness of diseases affecting cognitive function has advanced in the public eye. Although some may quibble at some details of the portrayal of Alzheimer's disease (dips in cognitive status are matched by wild ton sorial disarray and dramatic stubble growth) there is a poignancy to the presentation of the son's loving relationship with his father. Our first encounter is off-stage, hearing Lithgow's character struggle unsuccessfully to launch a Debussy prelude on the piano: the success of the research compound, in a truly novel out come measure, is signalled by some delight fully articulated Bach. His declining memory is a dramatic foil to the burgeoning intelligence of Caesar and his fellow apes. Both link us back to fears about the influence of the medical-industrial complex, increasingly seen by some commentators as just as forceful and as undemocratic an influ ence on society as the military-industrial com plex about which Dwight Eisenhower famously warned at the end of his presidency in 1961. One of the bulwarks against such overt and covert steering of the healthcare agenda should be a high level of ethical discourse in the training and practice of scientists, and the film is a reminder that this is not yet the case, even allowing for the artis tic licence and oversimplification demanded by such movies. Although doctors and their regulatory bod ies have made enormous strides in the past few decades in developing and implementing eth ics courses in undergraduate and postgraduate curriculums, most countries have substantially less provision for ethics courses in the so called basic sciences and engineering, even allowing for advances in biosciences education in the UK (see Bioscience Education 2005; 5 :c 1, www. bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk/journal/vol5/ beej-5-cl.aspx). Yet the potential fallout from developments in a broad range of sciences, from climate control through nanotechnology to genetics, has as much if not more potential to wreak havoc on a wide scale as anything in medicine. A neat accompaniment to this blockbuster, and also well worth seeing, is the documentary Project Nim. It recounts the true life story of the chimpanzee Nim Chimpsky (a wry homage to the renowned linguist) and a hubristic project to establish communication between man and monkeys. Every bit as fascinating as the life story of the chimpanzee is the unfolding I of a saga of the misguided and deeply unpro &lt; ^ fessional behaviour of the scientists, and the g willingness of a wide array of educated people | to subscribe to a sentimental, anthropomorphic § delusion.
