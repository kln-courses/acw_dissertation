<plain_text><page sequence="1">More on a Cognitive Theory of Religion by RICHLEY H. CRAPO Department of Sociology, Social Work, and Anthropology, Utah State University, Logan, Utah 84322, U.S.A. 23 VI 81 Guthrie's (CA 21:181-203) recent attempt to set forth a theory of religion is a welcome contribution to the literature. It not only illuminates a number of important issues, but has stimulated thoughtful contributions by other scholars to the ongoing debate about the nature and sources of religion in human life. Guthrie takes as his jumping-off point the in- adequacies of the concept of a supernatural realm as the key- stone of a definition of religion. Since Tylor's minimal definition of religion, the majority, of anthropologists and sociologists have included this concept as a central element of their defini- tions (see Malachek 1977:395-401). Guthrie and an increasing number of anthropologists agree, however, that the Western folk concept of a supernatural realm is uncommon in the cultures of the world and will not serve as a defining feature of religion in general. Guthrie replaces it with the concept of anthropomorphism, and in doing so he is in respectable com- pany. He himself cites Spiro (1966) and Horton (esp. 1960, 1967, 1973) and briefly discusses the voluminous historical and philosophical literature on anthropomorphism in religion from Xenophanes to our own day. Interestingly, he fails to cite White (1969), who also argues that anthropomorphism is not only an important feature of religion, but its defining element. There is certainly a strong intuitive appeal to the replacing of a term which refers to a culture-bound folk category with a term which refers to a psychological process that certainly occurs at times in all human individuals. Yet several of those who comment on Guthrie's definition of religion have been critical of his use of anthropomorphism as the defining charac- teristic of religion. Buchdahl (p. 194) calls for a more critical appraisal of the concept, though he fails to elaborate his reasons. Greenberg (p. 196) objects to Guthrie's assertion that, since religious belief is characteristically anthropomorphic, it is by definition false: "be it ever so sophisticated, no analysis of the language of man suffices to pronounce on the reality of its referents." If I read him correctly, there are, in Greenberg's opinion, two kinds of anthropomorphism: one that correctly notes human-like qualities in the nonhuman and one that asserts the existence of human-like qualities where none in fact exist. Guthrie, in the view of Greenberg, is asserting that religious anthropomorphism is of the latter kind without saying why. Guthrie sidesteps the real query--what his grounds are for asserting the falsity of religious anthropomorphism--by reiterating that anthropomorphism is (p. 200) "by definition-- I must insist--mistaken, which is what distinguishes it from perception of the real continuities and similarities of human and nonhuman nature." This response is clearly circular, for if there is but one form of anthropomorphism Greenberg's question has not been answered. In such a case, it must be translated as "What are the grounds for determining when an interpretation is anthropomorphic, that is to say, mistaken?"-- for if a set of beliefs is not mistaken, then it does not fulfill Guthrie's criterion for being labelled anthropomorphic. Sharpe (p. 198) too recognizes that this is the real issue here: "For some ungiven reasons Guthrie dismisses the religious anthropo- morphic type of model as having any truth value. (His reasons would help in understanding his criteria.)" There is more here than the simple religiously motivated obscurantism Guthrie seems to suspect. The issue is an im- portant one epistemologically. Both Guthrie's definition and his theory are too significant not to be fully explicated. If one insists that the definition of a cow include that it be three- footed, one cannot then justifiably contend that all creatures which people call cows have only three legs. Guthrie must make explicit either his grounds for insisting that falsity is characteristic of anthropomorphism or his method of deter- mining that a specific belief he wishes to call anthropomorphic is, indeed, false. His failure to clarify his use of anthropomor- phism returns us to the same swamp in which the use of the concept of the supernatural is floundering as a definer of religion. The essential problem with the concept of the supernatural is not that it is not universal. Being universal would make it a useful emic indicator of religion, but not being so would not prevent it from being an etic criterion if it could be unam- biguously defined. It is useless for this purpose because there is no non-self-contradictory way of defining it. To use it in defining religion we must either believe the supernatural to exist in the institutions which we say fit our definition or be able to demon- strate that something believed in by the followers of a religion does in fact transcend the natural. Guthrie and others have shown that the emic distinction between natural and super- natural is far from universal. Thus, the first case fails. Yet the second case seems empirically unattainable, since an empirically useful etic definition of the supernatural (read superempirical) is a contradiction in terms. Now, if one argues, as does Guthrie, that an anthropomor- phism is, by definition, false, then one must be prepared to demonstrate that the beliefs one labels anthropomorphic are false. But just how does one empirically demonstrate the empirical nonexistence of a thing (such as a deity who responds to symbolic communication) which is believed to exist by the adherents of a particular religion? At best, one can argue, as does Guthrie (p. 200), that one lacks sufficient evidence to consider certain beliefs empirically valid. In practice, then, as defining elements of religion both anthropomorphism and the supernatural amount to an assertion that an institution one labels religious is one which espouses false beliefs about the Vol. 23. No. 3. June 1982 341</page><page sequence="2">nature of the world. This explains why Guthrie suggests that Buchdahl has "a 'soft spot' for religion" and that Greenberg "seems to start from a religious orientation and hence takes exception to my verdict on the truth of religious assertions." White, who in 1949 attempted to replace the supernatural with anthropomorphism as the key element of religious belief, ran afoul of this same problem. In elaborating on the nature of anthropomorphic thinking, White (1969: 64-69, 110-13) de- clared that its essential quality is a confusion of self with not- self, that is, an error in judging the locus of an experienced phenomenon. The only way of bypassing the issue of the truth value of religion is that of the functionalists. However, their equation of religion with some kind of concern with ultimates, highest- priority values, and the like has the undesirable side effect of classifying as religious such diverse phenomena as Marxism, scientific or agnostic humanism, professionalism, recreational fanaticism, and traditional religions. Elucidating similarities which may exist among such phenomena is certainly a valid pursuit and in some ways an enlightening one, but the func- tionalist approach bypasses the traditional central concern of students of religions as a human phenomenon: how the institu- tions traditionally labeled religions differ from secular institu- tions and what explains their origin and perpetuation. We find ourselves at an impasse: The functionalist approach blurs important distinctions between religious and nonreligious systems of thought and action; the substantive approaches, both traditional and contemporary, are forced to assert, on one level or another, the falsity of religious ideation, yet seem to flirt with tautology when they attempt to set forth their reasons. Perhaps this dilemma itself reveals something about the religious phenomenon. The assertion that, by scientific criteria, the fundamental premise (anthropomorphism, in the view of Guthrie and White) is mistaken may be taken as an indication that scientific and religious criteria of the truth value of ideas differ fundamentally. In terms of the rule of simplicity or economy-a rule for the evaluation of ideas which is especially useful if one is guided by pragmatic goals in one's theory building-anthropomorphic interpretations are often extremely unparsimonious. Yet, as Saliba (p. 198) has pointed out, religion is not merely a matter of theory building, but has an important experiential and emotional component. It is here that the functionalists' contribution to our under- standing of religious ideation should not be overlooked, even if we refuse to let it overshadow the contribution of the in- tellectualist tradition: religion plays an important role in the reduction of anxiety (understood here as the subjective ex- perience of stress), and the ideas of religion (to echo Earhart, pp. 195-96) are evaluated by religionists by a criterion of truth which grows out of this benefit more than out of the desire for pragmatic understandings based on reduction of ambiguity. It is for this reason that, as Saliba (p. 198) has said, "for the believer, religion is not just a way of knowing, under- standing, and interpreting the world around us, but also, and especially, an affirmation of another kind of reality. In other words, the believer asserts that what he or she believes in 'actually exists.' " It is the different functional roles of religion and science which make it difficult (as Jarvie indicates, p. 197) to demonstrate that religion or magic is in error. The inclusion of some sort of premise about the role of anthro- pomorphism in reducing anxiety extends Guthrie's theory beyond its present state of accounting for the possibility of religion (i.e., for the plausibility of religious interpretations in spite of their falseness by scientific criteria) to a form which begins to enable us to test hypotheses concerning the circum- stances under which specific (stress-related) religious ideas will flourish or be discredited. Reply by STEWART GUTHRIE Division of Social Sciences, Fordham University, College at Lincoln Center, New York, N.Y. 10023, U.S.A. 20 I 82 I thank Adams (CA 22:84-85) and Crapo for their kind com- ments and especially for Adams's reference to possible anthro- pomorphism in religious architecture and Crapo's reference to White. I agree that anthropomorphism of a sort is present in at least some religious buildings. Cruciform churches, for example, directly reflect the outline of the human body. Adams's sug- gestion that all bilaterally symmetrical buildings are body symbols and hence likely to be religious is very interesting and, if demonstrated, would be welcome support for my argument. Adams offers not an explicit critique of my position, but a position of his own, one that depends on a division (which he says all cultures recognize) of the universe into "inanimate things," "persons," and "unseen forces." Things and persons here appear to be mutually exclusive, while forces "animate" both of them. Human activities are religious or scientific according to which of these three categories they address and how they do it. This scheme does not seem to me to be broadly applicable, for several reasons. Its tripartite division of the world does not fit either Western folk or contemporary scientific taxonomies. To which division, for example, could plants and animals belong? It also seems untrue that all other taxonomies recognize it: some cultures, for example, do not recognize a category of inanimate things. The three categories seem at once to be neither etic nor emic. Although Adams does not give his definition of religion, he says it hinges on "communication between man and the forces around (and within) him" and that religion "includes all strategies for dealing with willed or sentient forces" through communication. To me, these statements are too inclusive, since they make all communication "religion." Adams's explanation of anthropomorphism also is different from mine. He says that among all visible and tangible entities with which we deal, we treat communicatively only those which are animal or human, so that when we deal communicatively with "forces" it is only logical to impute animal or human form to them. This account, to begin with, identifies animism with anthropomorphism without saying why. The question of their relationship is interesting but is not clarified here. More im- portant, this account puts the matter backwards, since it leaves unanswered the question why we treat "forces" communica- tively in the first place. My own answer is that when we do so, it is because we conceive them according to models developed and proved important and fruitful elsewhere, namely, with humans, and attempt to deal with them accordingly. Crapo cites White (1969) as an earlier exponent of anthropo- morphism as the defining element of religion. However, al- though White does think anthropomorphism central to religion, his view both of its causes and of its place in religion is difficult to sustain. First, White sees anthropomorphic thought as qualitatively different from other, especially scientific, thought. It is for him an unconscious projection of the self into the external world, caused by an inability of people, especially in early cultures, to distinguish self from not-self. In such cultures (his example is the Omaha of Fletcher's 1910 account), man "diffused his psyche throughout the cosmos; he confused the self with the not-self at almost every point" (p. 66). This unconscious projection constitutes the first of "only two major types of philosophy: one in which the external world is inter- preted in terms of the human ego, the other in which it is explained in terms of itself" (p. 64). White's approach seems to me mistaken on several counts. First, it does not seem true that normal adults in any culture simply fail to distinguish self from not-self. Piaget has shown 342 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">that this distinction is learned in early childhood by direct experience of parts of the environment that respond to will and parts that do not. If the distinction is so learned, it is not likely to be, as White suggests, a latter-day achievement of cultural evolution. Moreover, although conceptions of self and and not-self do vary cross-culturally, the clarity of the dis- tinction between them does not covary with cultural com- plexity. Indeed, the strongest assertion that self and not-self are really the same comes not in the religions of simple cultures, but in such complex, sophisticated systems as, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism, which -advance it against the more primitive and commonsensical notion that they are different. Second, White's assertion that there are only two major types of "philosophy" (i.e., world view), one of which consists of unconscious projections of self while the other (evidently "conscious") consists of explanations of the world "in terms of itself," is too simple. It attempts, in the tradition of the early 20th century, a bipolar categorization of thought in which religion, at one pole, is subjective, emotional, and nonrational while science, at the other, is objective, detached, and rational. It is neither necessary nor possible here to answer White in full, but I would like briefly to make two points. First, both science and religion employ unconscious as well as conscious processes; second, both use metaphor and analogy pervasively. Scientific insights may come in dreams or other dissociative states, while religious thought may be self-conscious and logical. If metaphor and analogy are pervasive, then a phenomenon is never ex- plained purely "in terms of itself," as White thinks happens in science, but always in terms of something else. White uses the term "supernaturalism" (p. 65) to describe both anthropomorphism and "animism," but defines none of these terms. As Saler (1977) has argued and as Crapo and I agree, however, supernaturalism is a Western folk category which tells us nothing cross-culturally useful about religion as a mode of thought. In sum, White has noted that religious analogies draw on human models, but he has no good explanation why they do so. He simply attributes it to projection of self as though such projection were itself a need. This attribution of anthropo- morphism to something like a drive seems, to adopt his terms, an example of the "metaphysical" thought that he and Comte think is intermediate between projective and scientific thought. By noting but not explaining the anthropomorphism of religion, he appears to have advanced little beyond Xenophanes. Crapo thinks that my definition of religion as anthropo- morphism, together with my assertion that anthropomorphism is false, is circular and that I sidestep the "real query," what my grounds are for thinking it false. Somewhat inscrutably, he compares my definition of anthropomorphism (though it is Webster's, and in accord with usage) to one which insists that a cow be three-footed. To see why anthropomorphism is by definition false, let us return to Webster: it is the "interpretation of what is not human or personal in terms of human or personal characteristics." A "characteristic" in turn is, according to Webster, "a distinguishing trait, quality or property." The kind of interpretation in question is, then, one which interprets something in terms which are distinct from those which belong to it. The notion of falsity is thus part of the concept. The question then becomes, as Crapo anticipates, what are the grounds for asserting that an interpretation is anthropo- morphic, that is, mistaken? The answer depends on identifying human characteristics: features that occur in humans but not in the world at large. Crapo and several others seem to think that I do not identify any such characteristics and thus am merely tautologous. In fact, however, I spend ten paragraphs (CA 21: 189-90) suggesting that language and symbolic behavior generally, and by implication the kind of organization necessary to produce and understand them, set off humans from the world at large. If this is so, any interpretation of the nonhuman world as so organized as to communicate symbolically (e.g., to send plagues as warnings or to hear prayer) is anthropo- morphic. Of course, it may still turn out that events in the world at large (meteor courses, droughts, famines, earthquakes, rain- bows) are parts of a vast system of symbols by which Someone is speaking to us, that language does not belong to humans alone, and that the apparently nonhuman world is after all organized in whole or in part like a person or persons. In that case anthropologists who think language a human characteristic would be mistaken, and religions would not be anthropomorphic but would share a true perception that the world talks and listens (although they would still have differences to resolve about what it is saying). Whether the world is or is not organized in this fashion- i.e., whether there are or are not gods or God behind its phe- nomena, who communicate through them-is a question, as we know, not susceptible to clearly demonstrable answers. Even in this regard, however, the question is not distinct (though many have thought it so) from scientific questions. As recent philosophers and historians of science have noted, scientific revolutions are brought by persuasion and consensus, not by proof. Even relatively specific questions (whether quarks exist or whether the evolution of life is gradual or episodic) may allow only probable or plausible answers, not logically necessary ones. Hence it is not possible to satisfy Crapo's call for a "method of determining that a specific belief . .. is, indeed, false." One can only offer some conceptual scheme, some matrix of facts and theories, as coherent and relevant to the belief in question and judge what place the belief has in the matrix. The scheme I have offered takes as its central fact the pervasive tendency of humans to anthropomorphize the world. It takes as its central theory the set of propositions and deductions explaining why they do so. Set in this matrix, religious beliefs look very much like members of a larger class of perceptions which includes discovery of voices in the wind and faces in clouds or barroom floors. These perceptions discover in phe- nomena in general the materials with which to satisfy the demands of various humanlike models. To escape what he sees as an impasse between the unsatis- factory (because it includes too many cultural phenomena as "religion") functionalist approach and the unsatisfactory (because tautologous) substantive approach, Crapo suggests that we use a bit of each and that we recognize that scientific and religious "criteria of the truth value of ideas differ funda- mentally." Scientific truth, he suggests, has to do only with building theories, while religious truth has, in addition, experien- tial and emotional components, principally its capacity to reduce anxiety. People believe, that is, because they want to believe. This suggestion seems dubious on several counts. First, all theories have experiential and emotional aspects, since none is created ex nihilo and since all bear on the nature of the world and our place in it (witness the general furors created by Galileo, by Darwin, and even by the more esoteric Heisenberg, among many others). Second, all theories reduce, at the very least, the anxiety of having no theory at all. This gives us one reason people create theories, but it does not tell us why they create specifically religious ones. What most anxiety-reduction theorists claim is that religious beliefs are comforting because they picture a world that is orderly and is comfortingly human. There is some truth to this claim, but it is insufficient: scientific beliefs are orderly too, and, while religious models are human- like, they may or may not be particularly comforting (witness wrathful Yahweh, eternal damnation, and demons). As Rad- cliffe-Brown pointed out, their social effcacy may depend precisely on their fearfulness. It is instructive that in the West, for example, "good" can be nearly synonymous with "God- Vol. 23 * No. 3 * June 1982 343</page><page sequence="4">fearing." It is therefore mistaken to say that people simply believe whatever is pleasing to believe. Finally, Crapo's suggestion that scientific and religious truths are incommensurate because science and religion have "different functional roles" and (apparently) therefore do not conflict is epistemologically unsatisfying and historically in- accurate. By seeming to say that the world is not one thing but is whatever people think it is, it is radically relativistic and frustrates the tendency of thought to unify experience. By suggesting that science and religion do not really conflict because they have different functions and produce different kinds of truth, it asks us to ignore their long-standing, occa- sionally violent, and continuing public disagreements about the origin and nature of the universe.
