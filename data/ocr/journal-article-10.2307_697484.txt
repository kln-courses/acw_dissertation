This is some- what apeyaBsor Bporco aloSpi, but, taken at its full face value, it also appears to have an answer on the very oldest lines in L)r. Drerup's book. A. SHEWAN. EXPLORA1 IONS IN THE ISLAND OF MOCHLOS. (dated as it is to the same period by some clay vessels of E. M. II. style) is a low-class ossuary. The jar-burials alone represent a later variation of custom: some of them were empty, others contained the bones of infants; the main cemetery of M. M. III. and L. M. I., to which they belong, clearly lay elsewhere; and these children were buried apart intentionally. It is not so clear whether those who buried them knew any longer that this plot of ,round contained older tombs. Some of the latter were, however, discovered and broken up by M. M. III. peopie; not long therefore before the jar-burying began. A curious feature of the Mochlos tombs is a ' ISlling of sticky white clay, differing widely from the natural brown earth of the hillside' (p. I6), and closely resembling both the natural soil of the cemetery in Pseira, and a mainland clay which is used now for house roofs. Was it originally the roof of the graves, carried perhaps on wooden beams, which have faded away ? The pottery, which as usual gives the chief clues to date and sequence of style, does not offer much of exceptional interest, though in a number of points it ampliEes our knowledge of Early WIinoan ceramic, which (as is well known) is less well represented than later styles in some of the standard Cretan series. An anthropomorphic vase (fig. 34) carries back both the headgear and also, less obviously, the costume of the ladies of Petsofa into E. M. III. More impor- tant is the Early Minoan jewellery, of very light material usually, but charm- ing effect; solid beads of simple form, and varied colour and material, inter- changed with bracteal gold - work of leaves, sprays, and sometimes well- formed flowers. Other metal work is not common, and the daggers and other implements of copper or poor bronze R Explorations in the Island of Mochlos. BY RICHARD B. SEAGER. PP. I I I, with II plates and 54 Egures. Boston and New York: Published by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, I 9 I 2. THIS is the deSnitive report of excava- tions undertaken in I908, in continua- tion of work already noted briefly in the America? JournaZ of Archaeology, xiii., I909, pp. 273-303. Mr. Seager's earlier work at Pseira, and other sites in the neighbourhood of GourniA, is sufficient guarantee for skilful digging and minute accuracy of description, and this ac- count of Mochlos is an important addi- tion to our knowledt,e of early Crete. Mochlos is an islet separated now from the north coast of Crete by a few yards of shallow sea, and occupied in Minoan times by a small town and its ceme- tery. The town was excavated lSrst, and does not come into this volume; a brief resume of the plan and contents of the houses would have been a con- venient addition here. The tombs, twenty-four in number, if we include one late Minoan interment, are of several types; ossuaries or chamber tombs, cist graves lined with slabs, like those of the Cyclades, built graves differing only from the cist graves in the use of rubble walling instead of slabs; burials in holes and a rock cave, without any lining at all; and pithos-burials. The diversity of type is less than appears at Erst sight. Ossuaries and cist graves have already been found at Palai- kastro, to be associated as primary and secondary stages of the same rite of interment. Slab- lined graves give place to rubble graves at the transition from Early to Middle Minoan. The unlined holes clearly contain the poorer contemporaries of the cist-grave people; and it may be suggested with some con- Edence that the small cave full of bones NO. CCXXXVII. VOL.

(sSg. 36 I.n.) should be of Babylonian origin does not seem probable, though the dis- coverer suggests no alternative; but the Cypriote and Egyptian inter- mediaries suggested on p. III are both incompatible with other than Euph- ratean origin. Why should it not be Cretan ? In any case, if it is worth discussion at all, it deserves republica- tion in such form as will permit a judg- ment as to its style and technique. Quite exceptional, on the other hand, are the vessels of banded and brecciated limestones, which borrow their forms sometimes from Early Minoan pottery, in those phases where it most approxi- mates to the Cycladic schools; some- times, though more remotely, from the earlier dynasties of the Old Empire of Egypt. And the decorative value of these parti - coloured materials was appreciated by the craftsman; for it is imitated, both here and at Knossos, in the ceramic art. The technique of these stone vases is the subject of a separate section on pp. 99-IOO, where note is taken of the decline of this lapidary art after the popularisation of copper. The speculation as to its origin, on p. I02 5., would be less needful if closer study were given to its Cycladic counterpart; for here Egyptian in- fluences are hardly in question. It must be kept in mind throughout that there is a fundamental distinction, technologically, between the manipula- tion of clayey limestones like those of Crete, or even saccharine marbles like the Cycladic, and really hard stones like the diorite and porphyry of Egypt. Egyptian initiative may be concedecl, without prejudice to the skill or the taste of the craftsmen who rendered in steatites and breccias the long- spouted and subtly moulded vase- forms which originated with Aegean potters. The early decease of the settlement at Mochlos is signiIScant of the seamier side of the ' Palace culture' of Knossos in L. M. I. and II.: for the L. M. I. vase which is Egured in Plate XI. is still under the influence of the poly- chrome style which predominates in Crete in M. M. II. and III.: it there- fore would seem to belong to the earlier part of L. M. I. Once disestablished, too, Mochlos seems to have been for- gotten, or to have lost its utility, under the changed conditions of L. M. III.; and the Early Iron Age also passed it by unoccupied. To appreciate the full signiIScance of Mr. Seager's work, in- deed, we require similar record of another dozen such sites: for though the groundwork of a Minoan archa- ology is laid securely by brilliant dis- coveries on the great central cites, the results of excavation such as this at Mochlos still raise, evidently, far more problems than they solve. So we look forward to more books like this one. JOHN L. MYRES. STEINBRUCHE AND BERGWERKE.

THE evidence to be obtained from papyri concerning the mines and quarries of Egypt is rather fuller, at least for cer- tain localities and periods, than might have been expected; and it was a good idea to collect and utilise the material in this elaborate monograph. The quarries in and around the Fayum are the most generally familiar ovving to the fortunate accident that many of the Petrie Papyri relate to them; but light is thrown on the industry in other parts of Egypt also from various sources, literary and otherwise, particularly in- scriptions; and the subject is of the greater interest becauce in this land of</page></plain_text>
