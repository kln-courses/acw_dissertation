<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS. Generation after generation of students has been asked to account for the nature of Zeus in the Prometheus Bound, and to compare it with Zeus in other plays of Aeschylus and particu- larly in the Oresteia. I remember having to answer the question as an undergraduate nearly fifty years ago, and I put a very similar question on an exam paper quite recently. During most of the intervening years I imagine that an undergraduate would have had little chance of satisfying his examiners if he answered that the cruel and arbitrary Olympian tyrant of the Prometheus was in no way surprising since Aeschylus, though a great poet, was no thinker in matters of religion and that his gods remained primitively anthropomorphic from beginning to end, arbitrary, unjust, and unreliable. Yet this is very much the position en- dorsed, these last few years, by both the Professors of Greek literature at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.' The accusation of primitive anthropomorphism has, in my opinion, been sufficiently refuted by Leon Golden and Kitto.2 See H. Lloyd-Jones, "Zeus in Aeschylus" in J. H.S., LXXVI (1956), pp. 55-67, which contains a useful review of past theories and interpretations. Lloyd-Jones maintains that Aeschylus' conception of Zeus contains nothing that is new, nothing that is sophisticated, and nothing that is profound. "There is no reason to suppose the Zeus of the P. V. to be unaeschylean. .. ." He then argues that Zeus has to yield to the threat of Prometheus but this implies no change in his character. So too the Furies make a deal with Athena. See also, by the same author, "The Guilt of Agamemnon" in C. Q., XII, 2 (1962), pp. 187-99. Denys Page in his introduction to the Denniston-Page edition of the Agamemnon (Oxford, 1957) seems to go even further (pp. XI-XVI). "Innumerable superstitions darkened and dominated the lives of men; and in this respect Aeschylus was certainly not in advance of his time. For him, the ministers of the divine will are a diverse and jealous brood, and Zeus appears indifferent to the conflict of their claims." And again: "Aeschylus is first and foremost a great poet and a most powerful dramatist: the faculty of acute or profound thought is not among his gifts." 2See Leon Golden's "Zeus, whoever he is . . ." in T. A.P.A., XCII (1961), 156-67; and the Chapter on Aeschylus in H. D. F. Kitto's Poiesis (Berkeley, 1966), pp. 33-115. 43</page><page sequence="2">G. M. A. ORUBE. They have pointed out that anthropomorphism is inevitable on the Greek, and indeed on any, stage. Golden has pointed out, further, that there are far fewer anthropomorphic references in the plays than is alleged, especially in the Agamemnon, and that such as occur are most naturally interpreted as poetic meta- phors. Kitto has also successfully protested against seeing in Aeschylus a great poet and dramatist who is no thinker, and against an Aeschylean world full of Demons who must be taken literally. I do not intend to go over the ground adequately covered by these two scholars, for they have, I believe, quite disproved the Lloyd-Jones/Page contention. Lloyd-Jones maintains further that, in the Prometheus, Zeus yields to compulsion and that there is no trace of any true reconciliation, and also that the Furies in the Eumenides yield only to Athena's threat of the thunderbolts of Zeus. As Kitto has pointed out, however, the threat is quite incidental (827-8). It does not diminish the reality which the Furies represent or from the importance of a willing surrender on their part. It is hard to see why, if the threat of the thunderbolt is the only effective argument, Athena should waste her time and ours with the long final scene (780-1045) where she tries to persuade the Furies to yield with good grace which they finally do, and promises them continued worship.3 To this brief mention of Zeus' thunderbolt I would apply what E. T. Owen wisely said with reference to the unsatisfactory argument used by both Apollo and Athena in the trial scene (that the father is the real parent): 4 It is difficult not to be stupidly literal when brought up against the details of an unfamiliar tradition. But let us remember the poet is not working out an intellectual solution to a metaphysical problem. We should not go to the poets for that kind of answer. A great poet's profound thinking is done with his imagination. Aeschylus, no doubt, is stating his faith, but he is stating it as a vision, not as a dogma; that is, he is putting it primarily before the eyes in concrete symbols, and he uses such symbols as the story he is using supplies or suggests. The acquittal of Orestes ' See Kitto, pp. 60-4.

However, merely to prove that Lloyd-Jones and Page are mistaken does not solve the problem of Zeus in Aeschylus, and on this more positive side I do not find the solutions of Golden and Kitto convincing. Golden 5 speaks of two aspects of Zeus, almost of two gods (p. 21): The Zeus of the Suppliants is man's protector, the stern but just judge of good and evil, the guardian of the sup- pliant and the stranger, whereas the Zeus of the Prometheus Bound is a cruel tyrant, a hater of mankind who exercises his savage power without respect to justice. Golden then mentions and rejects three previous attempts by scholars to reconcile these two different, indeed incompatible, conceptions of Zeus. The first is to say that the poet is not bound by any particular conception of Zeus who may be different from one play to the next. If this is true, then we must of course not speak of the Zeus of Aeschylus at all, or of Aeschylus' religious thought. The second attempt Golden calls the evo- lutionary theory, i. e. that Zeus himself changes and becomes more civilized; for this he finds no evidence. Thirdly, we may simply say that Zeus' purposes are beyond human understanding. Finding none of these explanations satisfactory, Golden puts forward his own, which is in effect that Zeus has two aspects; there is the Zeus of the Polls, the god of justice, the good heavenly king; but there is also the Zeus of Nature who sym- bolizes "the uncontrolled destructive powers of the world." " Thus Aeschylus' two views of Zeus are a poetic recognition of opposed forces in the world itself." True, but this surely only restates the problem. Golden then evolves, on the basis of the Prometheus, a theory that, in the reconciliation to come, " Aeschylus is telling us symbolically that the wild, savage forces of nature can be made to give way to the power of civilization and that man, Prometheus' ward, the proud bearer of Prome- 'Leon Golden, "Zeus the Protector and Zeus the Destroyer," 0.P., LVII (1962), pp. 20-5. See also his In Praise of Prometheus (Chapel Hill, 1966), pp. 100-26. 45</page><page sequence="4">G. M. A. GRUBE. theus' gifts, will be the agent for effecting the change." This is an attractive theory, but I can find no evidence whatever, either in the Prometheus or elsewhere, of this high destiny for man.6 Kitto,7 on the other hand, assumes two different aspects of the theoi generally, or rather two different kinds of enquiry about their nature, one of which he calls the "metaphysical," with the nature of the theoi as the direct object of speculation, the other he calls " Hesiodic," i. e. speculation about the nature of the universe or of human experience, with the theoi as the resultants (pp. 68-9): The tragic poets, to speak generally, are much more in- terested in human experience than in abstract "theological " thought, but they will occasionally cross the line into the metaphysical enquiry. This, naturally, is extremely con- fusing .... That the same god, Zeus, should first lay down the law that the Doer must pay, and then, in the same trilogy, ordain that a particular Doer shall not pay; that he should first be presented as a god of sheer power, might and violence, and then as one who relies on persuasion and intelligence, these and other such contradictions, considered as parts of a metaphysical theology, would be absurd-but the absurdity is of our own invention. Aeschylus' theology is truly Hesiodic in this, that he will use the theoi as an explanation, or a picture, of the way this or that came into existence. In spite of which he, like Euripides, will have his metaphysical moments, as when he declares in the Agamemnon (1485 ff.) that nothing comes to pass among mortals apart from Zeus .... This, it seems to me, is not essentially different from Golden's two aspects of Zeus, and the contradiction remains. Either the poet passes from the "I esiodic " to the "cmetaphysical" un- consciously, in which case he believes himself to be talking about the same god, or he does so consciously, and in that case he might as well have spoken of two gods (or a god and a devil). In either case, if Aeschylus was the serious thinker that Kitto claims he was, the contradiction should have been obvious to him. The emphasis on Zeus is found in all the plays of Aeschylus, * This implies an identification of Prometheus with man. The myth of Prometheus does tempt one to symbolic allegory. See for example E. A. Havelock's The Crucifixion of Intellectual Man (Boston, 1951). ' Kitto (note 2), pp. 67-70. 46</page><page sequence="5">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS. not only in the Prometheus and the Oresteia. There are, of course, references throughout to the gods and their power (in- cluding Zeus), but where gods are named, the references to Zeus are overwhelmingly more numerous than those to all the other gods. In the Persae, except that Atossa prays to Earth, and the chorus appeals to Hermes, as guide of the dead, to lead Darius to appear, Zeus is the only god named. Darius believes that it is Zeus who destroyed Xerxes (740), and Zeus who had formerly bestowed honour upon Persia (762). In the only passage which may be said to reflect upon the gods' dislike of hubris, it is Zeus who punishes minds excessively boastful-a harsh judge (820). The Sever leaves very much the same impression: the chorus do indeed call upon a number of other gods to save the city: on Athena, Poseidon, Ares, Aphrodite, Artemis, Hera, as well as Zeus 7rarcp 7ravrTEE. The curse upon the house of Laius is per- sonified, a destructive goddess "unlike the other gods " (721-4) and, since Apollo's oracle to Laius began all the trouble, Apollo is mentioned strictly in this connection (692, 745, 799). But all these mentions of gods are almost perfunctory when com- pared with those of Zeus. There are in this play no reflective passages as to his nature, but no other gods share the epithets of power applied to him (pjyCAE, 7rayKparTe, ravrreX). The Suppliant Women is full of Zeus, naturally enough since he is the protector of suppliants and also the chorus' ancestor through Io. Here too there are but few references to other named gods, and, of these few, several are appeals to those gods in what might be called their professional capacities: Apollo the Healer, Artemis the Helper in childbirth, Hermes the Guide, and the like. There are, however, several reflective passages on the nature of Zeus, on the obscurity of his purposes, or as the distributor of good and evil (81, 403, 524, 816-24, 1060). We may also note that, in the tale of Io, Zeus is mentioned as her healer and deliverer. Throughout these plays the divine is con- ceived as mainly Zeus, and the emphasis is on his supreme power. This emphasis on the supremacy of Zeus seems to show Aeschylus feeling his way to a kind of monotheism. It is true that we find this also in Hesiod. At the same time, he is longing to believe in a just and ordered world. He is then faced with a problem which every monotheistic thinker has to face, how to 47</page><page sequence="6">G. M. A. GRUBE. reconcile omnipotence with benevolence or at least with justice. And if we look at life steadily, with all its cruelty, injustice, and undeserved suffering, we shall not find the solution easy. We should not expect, as we too often do, the great Classical writers to solve problems unsolved to this day. One solution is to have recourse to mystery: " God moves in a mysterious way," or, as Aeschylus puts it: "The mind of Zeus is inscrutable," 8 i.e. beyond human understanding. This implies that, if we were able to understand it, we should see that, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, the end result is just. This is a statement of faith, of hope, and Aeschylus makes it, as Hesiod did when he made Justice the daughter of Zeus. At this point it may help us to understand the Greek view better if we remember certain basic features of the Olympian gods, and especially that, both in Homer and to some extent later, divine and human causation are not mutually exclusive. We find this at its simplest where Odysseus, recognized by Eurycleia, says in the Odyssey: "Now that you have thought of this and a god has put it into your mind," 9 where a modern reader is apt to comment: " Which do you mean ? Make up your mind, it cannot be both! " And the same is true when Diomede says: "Achilles will fight again when the spirit (thumos) in his breast urges him to and a god arouses him." (Diomede does not say or but and.)10 The Greek envoys appeal to Achilles to help them because Zeus is helping the Trojans.l1 Can one imagine a modern general asking an ally's help because God is on the side of the enemy? Divine causation is not in the epic and later a second cause or even a secondary one, it is an alternative way of describing the same event. This is why-a thing we find it hard to keep in mind-the fact that a god causes or orders a man to do something does not in any way free that individual of responsibility for his action. Even in the Iliad Agamemnon, while he says he was in the grip of Ate and Zeus deprived him of his wits, does not therefore deny his responsibility for the quarrel.12 The same ' E.g. Suppliants, 96. ' Odyssey, XIX, 485. 10 Iliad, IX, 703. 1 Iliad, IX, 236. Compare XI, 316-19; XVII, 626-34. 1 Iliad, XIX, 86-94 and 135-6. It is true that Agamemnon does say 48</page><page sequence="7">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS. feeling continues in Aeschylus and all the discussions as to the guilt of Agamemnon for the Trojan war or the sacrifice of Iphigenia are beside the point. Of course he is guilty. We may argue that the choice before him was a choice of evils. Certainly, but is not life like that? And, if Zeus is in all things, he will also be in this. All we can hope is that somehow, sometime, the mysterious purposes of Zeus may turn out to be just. And Aeschylus does give one or two indications, besides the mere statement of faith, of how this might be. It is in this con- text that we must understand the famous phrase "to learn by suffering." Men do often learn by suffering, and perhaps in this way the sufferings so unjustly inflicted on mankind may find justification even when (as in the Suppliant Women) prayers are in fact not answered, or not at once. Aeschylus saw quite clearly that the justice of Zeus is often not apparent at any particular moment, or in any particular situation, but he hoped that perhaps, if we could contemplate the fate of man over many generations as a trilogy may help us to do, we might then understand how the purposes of the Zeus of Nature and the Zeus of the Polis (as Golden calls them) might be reconciled.13 Not that this happens in every trilogy. The Seven Against Thebes is the last play of its trilogy, but here there seems to be no reconciliation, and the curse of Laius works itself out in bloody death to the end.14 Some kind of harmony, however, does result in the Oresteia; also, however it was worked out, in the Prometheia and in the Suppliants trilogy as well. We now know that he was not responsible (oVK atrTos) but the fact that he proposes considerable amends and his whole attitude, as well as that of others, show that he does feel responsible. See Kitto (note 2), p. 108: "What we call, separately, 'natural' and 'divine' causes are interwoven throughout. .. ." On the whole question of continued human responsibility see also N. G. L. Hammond's "Personal Freedom and its Limitations in the Oresteia" in J.H.S., LXXXV (1965), pp. 42-55 and A. Lesky's "Decision and Responsibility in the Tragedy of Aeschylus" in J.H.S., LXXXVI (1966), pp. 78-85. '8 This importance of time in Aeschylus' vision is much emphasized by J. H. Finley in his Pindar and Aeschylus (Harvard U.P., 1955), e.g. p. 183: "So with Aeschylus this long process of history attains to justice, in which shines the divine being," and passim. 1 On the difference between the Theban and later trilogies in this respect see F. Solmsen, Hesiod and Aeschylus (Ithaca, 1949), pp. 169-89. 49</page><page sequence="8">G. M. A. GRUBE. that all three belong to the later period of Aeschylus' life. Our evidence is obviously insufficient, but it is at least possible that the problem of how to reconcile justice with omnipotence weighed heavily on Aeschylus' mind in the last period of his life. The search for reconciliation between opposing principles inevitably involved changes in the poet's conception of his god, and since his Olympian Zeus is only that conception, this inevitably means a change in his Zeus himself. To a modern mind this would mean denying one god and worshipping a dif- ferent one since God is eternal and unchanging. To the Greek mind, however, there was nothing very strange in the notion that Zeus himself could change. He was not eternal in our sense; he had been born and there were myths of his childhood; he had conquered the previous generation of gods. Moreover, as Aeschylus' younger contemporary Herodotus knew very well, the Olympians were in large part creations of the poets.l5 It is true that the idea of the justice of Zeus was not new. We find it in Solon, in Hesiod, and even, very occasionally, in Homer.16 It does not seem, however, that they realized the im- plied contradiction between justice and omnipotence, whereas Aeschylus, I believe, saw this much more clearly.17 As he in- sisted more and more upon the omnipotence of Zeus, this led him, as we have seen, to his attempts to resolve it. It would seem then that the traditional view of Aeschylus as a religious thinker is justified as is that of a development in Zeus himself.s1 Yet we must not exaggerate, and here some of '6 Herodotus, II, 53. 16 See, for example, the simile at Iliad, XVI, 384, and the beautiful personification of prayers in IX, 496-512. The justice of Zeus is of course far more prominent in Hesiod, especially in the Works and Days, e.g. 225-39, 248-64. For Solon see the famous elegy on wealth (fr. 13 Edmonds). 17As Solmsen (note 13) says (p. 133): "There is no evidence that Hesiod ever felt a clash between these two aspects " whereas " Aeschylus certainly felt very strongly the conflict between the two different con- ceptions of Zeus. The antimony between the just Zeus and the mighty Zeus forms the very core of his Prometheia." 18This notion of a change in Aeschylus' Zeus has been accepted by a great many scholars, and declared impossible by others. For full references on both sides of the argument see Lloyd-Jones (who, of course, rejects the idea) in J. H. S., LXXVI (1956), pp. 56-7. To these 50</page><page sequence="9">ZEUS IN AESCHYLUS. the emphases of the Lloyd-Jones/Page view may provide a use- ful corrective. A thinker may make his own contribution with- out being original at every point. Nor must we make the Zeus of Aeschylus into a Christian God. The ancients, even the phi- losophers, put all the emphasis on justice, and very little, if any, on mercy, benevolence, or love. Indeed it is an obstacle to understanding to think of them as trying to find their way to our own very different conceptions of the divine. It might well be that Aeschylus, had he known it, would have rejected the Christian conception of God as untrue to life. Euripides, I feel sure, would have done so. The Greek gods always to a large extent remained personifications of natural or psycho- logical forces, often amoral, actually at work in human life and often at odds with each other. Belief in them had to remain rooted in life not as we should like it to be but as it is. This made it more difficult both to conceive of a truly supreme god, and also more difficult to reconcile this supremacy or mono- theism with benevolence or even with justice. G. M. A. GRUBE.

As Thomson puts it (pp. 6-7) "The ruler of the gods is a tyrant, the champion of mankind is guilty of pride. Both are diseased." And again (p. 12) "What is less familiar to us is the doctrine, not developed in the Oresteia, that this same path of suffering was trod, at the begin- ning of the world, by Zeus himself." 51</page></plain_text>
