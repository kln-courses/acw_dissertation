<plain_text><page sequence="1">Essay Review- Foundations of Architecture FRANCIS SPARSHOTT Fifteen years ago, when this reviewer was invited by this journal to survey a dozen books on architecture, the theme that prevailed among them seemed to be anxiety over a vernacular: given that buildings must be built, are costly, preempt space, and are likely to be durable, and given that one must build in a way that will look good and right for years to come, how is this to be achieved at a time when the conditions of life change as quickly and radically as the fashions of art? Many of the books betrayed a nostalgia for a time when architects worked with familiar materials, an accepted vocabu- lary of forms, and an unquestioned set of objectives and norms. But the works now submitted for review seem, whether by editorial choice, by coin- cidence, by historical development, or by the reviewer's idiosyncracies of interpretation, to have a different center of concern.' The prevailing interest now seems to be permanence: underlying principles of structure and de- sign, elements of formal manipulation, the concept of architecture itself, and, in a surprising number of cases, the "classical orders" whose persis- tence as staples of architectural practice should astonish us more than it usually does. The books tend to be very big, very heavy, full of pictures, physically hard to read. All without exception are informative and intelligent, they deepen the world's memory and enlarge its understanding; one cannot but be grateful. But the overall impression is disquieting. What exactly are they for? Who is supposed to read them, and why? The most daunting contribution is TAFURI's survey of some avant-garde movements. The preface claims that the essays in the book have a common theme. If they do, the theme is probably the thesis that truly advanced movements in architecture and the arts must be based on a thorough grasp of art history as a whole, and must either (like Piranesi, who in this resembles Francis Sparshott is a University Professor Emeritus of Victoria College, University of Toronto. Among his recent books are Off the Ground: First Steps to a Philosophical Con- sideration of the Dance, The Theory of the Arts, The Cave of Trophonius, The Hanging Gar- dens of Etobicoke, and The Concept of Criticism. He has contributed several articles to this journal.

But the book is by no means easy to follow. The approach is mostly that of Walter Benjamin, tricked out with fashionable French names, but the manner is unfortunately that of Adorno. That is to say, it proceeds by allusion, presuming the reader to be familiar not only with the authorities the author obliquely cites, but with the author's inter- pretations and attitudes. The result is an unintelligibility that readers are supposed to be bullied into attributing to their own ignorance, but which is in fact mostly a vagueness and ambiguity produced by the author's preten- tious posturing. In the present case, it is often unclear whether the fog is due to the author or to the translator. What looms through that fog is, how- ever, impressive. Immense erudition elucidates the architectural imagination of Piranesi, the relations between theatrical design and civic planning in the first half of the present century, and the attempts to produce a useful new architecture after World War II; and the book ends with an amusing de- nunciation of what the author takes to be the rootless frivolity of today's postmodernist vanguard. Unfortunately, since the book's appearance in Italian in 1980, the radical weaknesses of the socialism that TAFURI extols have become so obtrusive that a book which does not confront them has itself a frivolous air. This being so, TAFURI's denunciation of all argumenta- tive strategies other than his own as "infantile" fails to make its effect. The deep value of TAFURI's work lies in its confrontation of the problem of how the history of architecture is to be written. To write a history is to trace architecture to its origin, to its motivation. But to identify a motivation is tacitly to assign a purpose. Architectural writing as a whole is thus a "multiplicity of projects of domination," seeking to impose a finality on processes that themselves were projects of domination. Architect, historian, and critic alike must be thought of as intellectual workers, and each must be asked (in what seem to be Benjamin's words): "Does he succeed in promot- ing the socialization of the intellectual means of production? Does he see how he himself can organize the intellectual workers in the production pro- cess?" (p. 289). This is challenging. But the fate of state socialism in our day suggests that to read history in terms of power relations is inadequate un- less those relations are analyzed in terms of how information is exchanged in them, and the neglect of this matter gives TAFURI's analyses a factitious look. For whom is TAFURI's book intended? Chiefly, one suspects, for gradu- ates of TAFURI's seminars in an institution in which he is the dominant force. Aside from that, anyone who can grapple strenuously with rebarbative prose will profit from its brilliance, its massively solid erudition, and its challeng- ing ideas, even if, like the reviewer, they find themselves continually exas- perated and often repelled.</page><page sequence="3">Essay Review 75 At the opposite end of the historical spectrum from TAFURI's ideological analysis and synthesis is WILSON AND ROBINSON's festschrift for Leonard K. Eaton. The introduction suggests that the book represents a shared ap- proach: in contemporary architectural education in the United States, say the editors, architectural history has come into its own, with emphasis on actual buildings rather than photographs, and concentrating on the real so- cial pressures and individual demands that govern what gets built-a study that TAFURI explicitly renounces (pp. 1.3-14) as what happens when "the tragic and the banal are reconciled with reality." The editors point out that the history of journalism is part of their topic, since what becomes influen- tial is what is chosen to be photographed and published. In this reorien- tation of studies, one gathers, Eaton was a prime mover in the Middle West. In actuality, though, the collection is typical of its genre, the contributions simply representing what the authors chose to honor their teacher or col- league. The diversity itself supports the editorial contention, but the result is a book for library consultation rather than for personal purchase and con- tinuous perusal. Strongly recommended are Mary Corbin Sies's study of how the design program for the American suburban home was generated between 1877 and 1917, under the influence of the new enlightened profes- sional class, and Theodore Turak's presentation of an interview with the daughter of one of Frank Lloyd Wright's major clients, in which some old misunderstandings are charmingly corrected. Among the other articles, Kenneth A. Breisch on "William Frederick Poole and Modern Library Ar- chitecture" may be singled out as giving the most satisfying answers to questions the reader is least likely to have asked; and from the point of view of the present review a special interest attaches to Robert Benson's account of the skeptical reception by Douglas Haskell of the 1932 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in which Philip Johnson sought to equate modernity with an "International Style" whose identity was largely a function of his own promotion. The WILSON AND ROBINSON volume contains a painstaking account by Walter C. Leedy, Jr., of how complex the controversies were that led to the construction of a civic center and mall for Cleveland. A more comprehen- sive understanding of certain aspects of such debates may be gathered from HAAN AND HAAGSMA's survey of fifteen architectural competitions from the White House in Washington to the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Some of these have been widely discussed, notably those for the Chicago Tribune tower and for the Sydney "Opera House." As the authors observe (p. 154), "over the past hundred years hardly any single architectural trend has re- mained dominant for more than a decade"; as a result, international compe- titions, which often attract many distinguished designers, serve as an arena for contests between contemporary architectural philosophies. As Dennis Sharp points out in a concluding essay, these conflicts are seldom straight- forwardly between "traditional" and "modern." As we go through the book</page><page sequence="4">76 Francis Sparshott we learn that the winner of a competition is not always the architect who gets to design the building; and, if he (or she) is, the building that results may bear little resemblance to the design that won the prize. An egregious instance is Stockholm Town Hall: the original contest was for a Palace of Justice, but the jury liked the winning design so much they decided to make it a Town Hall instead-after which the design was changed so much as to bear little resemblance to what won the competition. Such vagaries arise partly from the fact that there can be no interchange between architect and client in generating the initial design, which is why many distinguished ar- chitects (such as J. J. P. Oud) refuse to enter competitions at all. This is a book of endless interest and enjoyment, but not perfect. The il- lustrations, though lavish, are very confusingly laid out, and the authors have no literary gift. The additional essays that conclude the book are un- fortunate: Dennis Sharp's overview of architectural competitions was com- plied without reference to the body of the book, much of the information in which he uselessly repeats and to which he adds little new insight, and Kenneth Frampton's account of Le Corbusier's contribution to the League of Nations fiasco at Geneva, very badly written, assumes intimate knowledge of Le Corbusier's project itself. Puzzled readers, by the way, are recom- mended to try transposing page 201, column 1, lines 11-25, with page 202, column 1, lines 15-17. All the books reviewed, even this one, make the reader struggle to grasp and keep in mind the full complexity of the decisions that architects and builders have to make, and the constraints on them. From this point of view, the reviewer would strongly recommend a book not reviewed here, Karl Sabbagh's Skyscraper, an excellent journalistic account of the actual dy- namics of taste and economics involved in a major project in New York.2 It conveys, as good journalism should, a vivid idea of what might be per- ceived as actually going on. The books we have been looking at have been concerned with the inter- action between artistic intention and reality. But TAFURI invited us also to look back to the intentions themselves. What about pure architecture, ar- chitecture as art? TAFURI is not the only author here to refer us to a dictum of Adolf Loos, to the effect that only monuments and tombs are pure architec- ture: everything else fails to be art because it is compromised with utility. One sees the point of the dictum easily enough, but one does not see why it is cited with solemnity; one would have thought it to be intended as a joke. If one wishes to be solemn about it, though, one may look at HOLLIER'S ex- position of the eccentric French intellectual Georges Bataille. "Exposition" is hardly the word, though; HOLLIER assumes that we know about Bataille or can inform ourselves about him, and composes a sort of rhapsody that takes him as theme. Bataille declares himself "against architecture" on the basis of Loos's dic- tum, which he interprets to mean that architecture stands for death. The</page><page sequence="5">Essay Review 77 idea is simply that architecture in the strict sense produces and symbolizes massive and immobile structures that inhibit life. Again, one sees the point, but it is not a point that vertebrate animals can accept without demur. He makes a fundamental contrast between pyramid and labyrinth, be- tween dead structures and systems of paths. This contrast may well be the source of the "sphere and labyrinth" of TAFURI's title, and the inspiration of the way he traces architectural design and town planning to different sys- tems of motivation. More generally, Bataille's literary project makes all writing out to be a denial of formal structure, which makes him a sort of founding father of deconstructivism and related movements of the 1960s in France. This seems to have little relevance to us, since (as Derrida says) deconstructivism finds it hard to get a purchase on architecture.3 However, HOLLIER (whose book first appeared in French in 1974) provides his translation with a new intro- duction, "Bloody Sundays," in which he takes up the cudgels on Bataille's behalf, claiming (with Derrida) that Bernard Tschumi's Parc de la Villette dismantles architectural meaning. The quality of the thought in this intro- duction may be illustrated by the following. Emile Zola once wrote an ar- ticle extolling the way workers enjoyed recreation at Saint-Ouen. But a year earlier his novel Therese Raquin had placed a murder in the same setting. HOLLIER refers to this as "the erasure of a murder by a holiday" (pp. xix-xx). One certainly needs to be clever and knowledgeable to be able to make that connection, but surely one needs to be silly to make a big thing of it. Of the storming of the Bastille, HOLLIER writes that "it is hard to explain this mass movement otherwise than through the people's animosity against the mon- uments that are its real masters" (p. x); he observes (because of the location of the Parc de la Villette) that "museums have a strange way of following in the footsteps of slaughterhouses" (p. xiv); and opines that "if the prison is the generic form of architecture this is primarily because man's own form is his first prison" (p. xii). "Is prison then the generic name designating all ar- chitectural production?" he asks (p. x). The short answer to that is "No." The ramshackle slippages of association on which so much contemporary "theory" depends may amuse, but do not instruct or (of course) edify. And we wonder why HOLLIER's introduction, written for English-speaking read- ers of a translation, should so calmly assume that such readers may be ex- pected to infer the nature of the world from anecdotes in the local history of Paris. The antithesis of Bataille's identification of architecture with oppression is to be found in ALBERTI's survey of the scope of architecture, which is re- ally an imaginative reworking of M. Vitruvius Pollio's work on the same theme from the first century BC. Vitruvius says himself that no one previ- ously had ever essayed a comprehensive treatise on the subject, and his work remained without rival until the Renaissance. It is a basic reference for several of the books reviewed here, and all writing on architecture as a</page><page sequence="6">78 Francis Sparshott whole really looks back to it, though it has never, to the reviewer's knowl- edge, been the subject of an illuminating commentary. Vitruvius' work is addressed to the emperor of the day, and claims to lay the foundation for the evaluation not only of existing buildings but of fu- ture productions; it is in this connection that he lays down the three dimen- sions of architectural value, famously Englished by Sir Henry Wotton as "commodity, firmness and delight." It is, however, an extremely puzzling work. What is its scope meant to be? Who is supposed to read it? The books it comprises were plainly composed separately, each with a preface em- phasizing how important architects are and how much they need to know, but the whole seems to exist in a cultural and technical vacuum. It is as if the author, apparently an architect and engineer formerly in the imperial service and seeking re-employment, had reviewed his own practice and read other people's essays, and then simply set down what seemed to him at the moment to be both important and nontechnical, ending up unself- consciously with the workings of clocks and military engines. In its place and time no doubt it made sense; as the sole authority on ancient architec- ture to survive the dislocation of classical civilization it is as bizarre as a mammoth in a glacier. One of the things that remained decisive is Vitruvius' unquestioning ac- ceptance of the column-and-lintel style of ceremonious building formalized by the Greeks. Vitruvius lays down the proportions canonical for the three "orders," associates each with a type of human body, and accordingly sug- gests a mythical origin for the column in the figure of a standing person supporting a building on his or her head. That is not the center of Vitruvius' work, but it was memorable, usable, and imaginatively suggestive. Any- way, everyone who writes on architecture has somehow to come to terms with Vitruvius; and a certain wackiness has been native to architectural writing ever since. ALBERTI's work on architecture was written around 1450 and published posthumously in 1486. It has never lost its status as one of the fundamental documents of the Italian Renaissance and hence of European civilization, but is not widely read; hitherto, the only English version has been one that appeared in 1726. Professor Rykwert and his colleagues have furnished a meticulous translation (though lacking the eloquence that Alberti's contem- poraries found in his Latin), a clear and informative introduction, an excel- lent encyclopaedic glossary, and austerely laconic notes. The format is too large and heavy for easy use (the producers of books on architecture often proceed as if massiveness were a virtue, perhaps because the illustrations need big pages and heavy paper), and the book is too expensive for wide distribution. No doubt a limited appeal is expected. If so, it is a pity. ALBERTI was a papal functionary as well as a leading man of letters and a practicing architect. The work before us is a stunning display of rhetorical</page><page sequence="7">Essay Review 79 virtuosity, sociopolitical sophistication, and technical grasp. As Rykwert observes, ALBERTI models himself on Vitruvius, but looks forward where Vitruvius looks back: instead of saying what has been done, he says what he would prefer or recommend. He expands Vitruvius' claim that architects should be erudite into an immense vision. Though his work bears the mod- est title De Re Aedificatoria, "On the business of building," his scope is wide. Architects, as their name etymologically implies, are not master-carpenters but people who tell carpenters what to do. To do that properly, they must know all those requirements of human life that call for permanent support- ing structures, so that they can "realize by construction whatever can be most beautifully fitted out for the noble needs of man" (p. 4). That is, they must provide the appropriate setting for a civilized life; and the underlying theme of ALBERTI'S work is simply the idea of a fully civilized existence for com- pletely human beings. What makes his work exciting is the way he inter- weaves the working out of this overall vision with the most concrete details of methods and materials, appealing to his own experience as well as to an- cient authority. He moves without hesitation between contemporary fact and classical text, as if his age were not a revival of Greco-Roman civiliza- tion but a perfectly natural continuation of it, only acknowledging by an occasional reference to "our own temples" the radical novelty of Christen- dom and its supporting ideology. It is a dazzling sleight-of-hand. As this ennobling and enthralling vision unfolds, the reviewer wonders why this book has never effectively functioned as a basic constituent in our own intellectual heritage. Perhaps there are two reasons. One is that the book is after all tied to its time, and the fifteenth century is an awkward time to be tied to: the fundamental moves that were to establish modernity had yet to be made, and in enthusiastically anchoring his own procedures in the classical past Alberti has after all ensured his own obsolescence. The other reason, perhaps more important today, is that the vision is itself sus- pect, for the very reasons that Bataille develops. The civilized vision em- braces only the leisured and educated. It is a static social order that is to be preserved and celebrated, and its built manifestation oppresses while it fa- cilitates. The values of leaders of church, state, and academy, which are those that determine the architect's vision, are false values because they re- flect leadership and not the lives we have to lead. Our global visions lately have almost all been of disorder and destruction; ALBERTI's confident hope- fulness does not speak to our condition. But it speaks, surely, to a condition we wish was ours. In any case, ALBERTI's novel and penetrating analyses, the brilliant originality, force, and freshness of his mind (in striking contrast to the plodding Vitruvius), are captivating. A less enthusiastic reading of ALBERTI is provided by Mark JARZOMBEK, who has read what almost nobody else has, ALBERTI's literary dialogues. The great work on architecture, he points out, like the companion piece on</page><page sequence="8">80 Francis Sparshott painting, is primarily a rhetorical triumph, and must be seen in relation to the totality of ALBERTI's literary output, which is heterogeneous and experi- mental. It is a mistake to treat the famous works as treatises on "aesthetics," as JARZOMBEK says most people do; ALBERTI's primary theoretical emphasis is on "the nature of the literary task" (p. 6). As JARZOMBEK sees them, ALBERTI's literary dialogues go against the tendency of his age by making writing a quasi-religious act, and the fundamental problematic in his writ- ings is the "divergence of word from meaning and being from image" (p. 85). In the context of ALBERTI's overall project the architect emerges as a na- ive functionary (pp. 152-54), simply unaware of the higher manifestations of mind: mystic vision and scholarly skepticism. JARZOMBEK has done us a great service in bringing this challenging ma- terial to our attention and giving us a limited acquaintance with it. But his interpretations are often forced and undefended, and his exposition is couched in an inadequately explained jargon, apparently of his own devis- ing, which acts as a screen between the reader and the subject matter. One often cannot tell what he means, or whether some thesis is his own com- mentary or his version of what ALBERTI meant. He writes as if he wished not to be understood but to be admired for his ingenuity. The pretentious ob- fuscations of his prose are in startling contrast with ALBERTI'S own urbane lucidity. And, on the specific issue of the interpretation of the work on ar- chitecture, he shows little sense of the complexities of the ways in which people's speculations relate to their practice and commitments. His book is unlikely to have much influence, though anyone interested in ALBERTI should study it with sympathetic interest. A durable part of Vitruvius' legacy was the reduction to system, and hence the elevation to classical status, of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian "orders" of Greek architecture, to which the Tuscan and Composite were later added (it was, ONIANS tells us, in Vignola's Rules of the Five Orders of 1562 that they finally became the "classical orders" [p. 3]). ALBERTI said that their use, though a useful resource, was not obligatory (p. 24); but they re- tain a privileged place in our architectural imagination, which is odd, be- cause the use of colonnades is limited and the tensile weakness of stone means that column-and-lintel construction can do little work (see MARK, p. 15). The place of the orders must depend on symbolic and expressive fea- tures, such as Vitruvius' fanciful anthropomorphism supplied. ONIANS pro- vides a splendidly clear and full account of the expressive use made of the orders at different times and places, in architectural theory and in the visual arts as well as in building practice. Effectively, the different columns were personified to embody authority, grace, political majesty, divinity. The per- sistence of the orders as meaningful components of architecture throughout the age when Gothic prevailed will no doubt open the eyes of other readers as it has those of the reviewer.</page><page sequence="9">Essay Review 81 ONIANS's clear and incisive narrative, based on a dissertation written un- der E. H. Gombrich, arouses confidence in the author's scholarship, though perhaps not in his anthropological speculation. A conclusion not drawn by the author may, however, suggest itself to the reader. The meanings as- signed to the orders differed from time to time and from place to place. But the fragments of these symbol systems survive side by side. The situation is like that which prevails in a forest where many travelers have blazed trees to mark obscure trails and turnings. The blazes survive when the purpose they served has been forgotten, and people who now wish to use them must guess which, if any, of the surviving marks will be appropriate guides to where they want to go. So nowadays, when the thread of our civilization has been broken, the significance of the orders must be quite indeterminate. They are reduced to symbols of a reassuringly general benignity, a kind of mindless crooning. From his tenth chapter on, ONIANS departs somewhat from his original topic by giving an account of the development of architectural theory in Italy. He draws attention to the way ALBERTI's system, by making architec- ture the embodiment of civilized order while ignoring its relation to actual social and political structure, raises the spectre of a system of power that has no location in space and time and is thus irresistible-the materialized tyranny that Bataille evokes by equating architecture with the construction of prisons and tombs. ONIANS contrasts ALBERTI with Filarete, who, writing around 1460, "writes the first modern theory of architecture" (p. 158) by systematically characterizing architectural genres and relating them to so- cial stratification: "His acceptance of social realities is a refreshing change after the pretentiously rhetorical, mystical, and ethical theories of Vitruvius, Hrabanus, and Alberti. His comparison of the aristocracy to large, finely carved exterior blocks and of peasants to a rough rubble filling is more re- vealing of perennial attitudes both to buildings and classes than all the ab- stractions of his predecessors" (p. 170). Well, maybe so, but other readers may think this sort of thing rather silly. George HERSEY tackles the problem of the persistence of the classical or- ders in a very different way. Instead of unraveling a history of codes and associations that is no longer accessible to the historically uninstructed eye, he reconstructs a psychologically potent mythology out of the legends of origin emphasized (he claims) by Vitruvius and occasionally revived, though ignored by ALBERTI and Filarete (p. 79). The ancient power of the five orders rests on a "tropic" or quasi-metaphorical way of seeing them, as records of sacrifices. This reminds us of Bataille's insistence on the association of ar- chitecture with death, though it represents "an architectural sensibility that has since vanished" (p. 3). Greek sacrifices "involved the destruction and reconstruction of the victim's body" (p. 16), and "We can see the temple as a grove of sacred trees decorated with battle or hunting trophies, or decked</page><page sequence="10">82 Francis Sparshott out like an altar, with reconstructed sacrifices" (p. 21). In the Doric triglyph, for instance, "the essential device of three upright bones wrapped top and bottom with shreds of dripping fat is clearly readable" (p. 31). And so on. Does this mean that we should see the orders in this light nowadays, and that architects who still use them have ancestral memories of blood and guts? Presumably not, because (as HERSEY does not say), such religious butch- ery has less meaning to us today than the architectural devices themselves have taken on simply by their continual use in solemn and ceremonial con- texts. His point may rather be, as his teasing remarks on Allan Greenberg suggest (p. 31), that the use of the orders has become essentially meaningless. HERSEY's book is crammed with startling illustrations and challenging as- sertions, and supported by overpowering erudition. The erudition does not always check out, however (try the reference to Lucian on p. 11), and HERSEY tends to claim that he has "proved" on an earlier page what in fact he merely claimed. And the method of "tropes," which is meant to emanci- pate our imaginations by supplementing actual connections by semiotic as- sociations, seems too often to turn on phrases used by the compiler of the dictionary one happens to be using in connection with words that happen to occur on the same page. In short, the book is endlessly stimulating, amusing, and informative, but it would be unwise to rely on the author's word for anything. HERSEY's book ends with consideration of a project by Robert Venturi for a country house, which is a sort of parody of George Washington's Mount Vernon: by exaggerating the distortion of its misshapen classical features, Venturi "has turned provincial solecisms into savage virtues" (p. 155). HERSEY's point has to do with the status of Vitruvian proportions as taboos, the violation of which Venturi failed to recognize. The question to which he suggests no answer, and does not even ask, is: what was the point of Venturi's project? The house was never built, and presumably was never meant to be. Is it a joke? If so, why is it funny? It has a sort of perverse el- egance, but the impression it leaves on this reviewer is that it is a mere demonstration of how clever Venturi is. Well, so he is; but what is the point of mere cleverness? One is reminded of TAFURI's scornful invective against those postmodernist architects whose "only preoccupation is to remain on the stage agitating themselves in an ever more grotesque manner" (p. 301). In a way, the classical status of the classical orders and the classicism in which they are embedded had to wait for Andrea Palladio's Four Books on Architecture (1571). His story is told by Robert TAVERNOR, one of the co- translators of ALBERTI, in an admirably clear, informative, and useful addi- tion to the well-known "World of Art" series. TAVERNOR writes elegantly and engagingly, though for some reason (perhaps the sheer abundance of the material so concisely conveyed) the significance of what one is being told does not easily come through as one reads.</page><page sequence="11">Essay Review 83 As the conscious prophet of Vitruvius, whose rediscovery in the preced- ing century had (as we have seen) inspired ALBERTI and others, Palladio omitted a lot of theorizing and produced "the first truly popular treatise on architecture" (p. 111). His own architecture, the basis of his publications, made a firm, lucid, and honest use of Vitruvian proportions in a way that was easy to follow, and the publication of his work in printed volumes made his ideas and buildings accessible everywhere as model and method. One of the underlying ideas is that of "concinnity," a concept developed out of Vitruvius by ALBERTI: measurements are to be governed by a few simple numbers (6, 10, 16) representing the proportions of the human figure, and reduced to multiples of a single module. This eventually makes it possible for a proponent of computer design to show how a machine can be pro- grammed to plot all possible variants of Palladio's basic villa designs (MITCHELL, pp. 152-79). TAVERNOR elucidates the origins of this accessible style, Palladio's devel- opment of it, and its spread through Europe and America, with a digression on Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren that takes us perhaps a little away from the theme. The end of the story is in America, culminating in Jefferson's University of Virginia, that overwhelmingly inspiring embodiment of ALBERTI's vision of civilization. Even in the provincial amateurishness of his British imitators in the eighteenth century, the useful lucidity of Palladio's method shines through. It is, however, an essentially modest style, one that could serve as paradigm only when the dominant social influence was that of a landed gentry. So it became obsolete in the days of the great corporations. Palladio exemplifies the maturity of a truly classical architecture, with an authorized vocabulary and a clear syntax, easily adopted and free from idiosyncracies. Only the classical orders themselves remain essentially irra- tional, to be explained only by myths of origins, by speculative anthropol- ogy and psychology, or by the authority of an unbroken tradition. Perhaps the choice of basic units in any system must be "irrational" in that they are explicable only by showing how they operate in the system; but, in that case, one would prefer one's basics to be something less bizarre than a Corinthian capital. What, then, if we dispense with the orders? We are left with the idea of a purely rational style, dependent on pure geometry, the properties of avail- able materials, and the necessities of human life. Such a pure classicism has reputedly been found in the "International Style" identified (as we re- marked) as the one true modernism by the 1932 MOMA show. Of this style the exemplary figure was chosen to be Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In the ideal associated with the newly dominant style, functions are clearly separated: a curtain wall is only a curtain (preferably of glass), a supporting member (preferably of steel) does nothing but support. Useless bits, like pitched roofs, are omitted. Decoration (condemned as sinful, by</page><page sequence="12">84 Francis Sparshott reasoning as specious as that used by theologians of a different school to proscribe onanism or euchre) was eschewed. Architectural value rested on the pure aesthetics of exquisite proportion and precision. The hallmark of the disciple of Mies is the preternatural sharpness of his pencils. The opulent volume edited by Frank SCHULZE was issued to accompany an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art celebrating the centenary of Mies's birth in 1886, and the contributors take his classical status for granted. Perhaps because of this, the overall effect on the reader of the five splendid essays that make it up is rather unsettling. The authors testify to the charis- matic power of Mies's personality, but leave the actual nature of his achieve- ment in doubt. It was his seigneurial manner, says SCHULZE in his introduc- tion, that made people think that his way of doing things was more than just a style but "an incontrovertible method" (p. 12)-which was unfortu- nate, because without his sensibility the lack of teachable substance left his followers with "the look of formula, sterility, or outright cheapness" (p. 13), as the world knows only too well. What was it all about? What was the attraction of the famous project for a "brick country house," reproduced in several of the books reviewed here? It makes a pretty diagram-"'tis very fine, But where d'ye sleep, or where d'ye dine?"4 What is the meaning of those long walls that seem to serve only as purposeless obstacles? Wolf Tegethoff, describing the handsome villas that established Mies's reputation, remarks that his houses make no provision for family life (pp. 56-57). As one looks both at the photographs and at Mies's own drawings, one becomes haunted by a recurring vision: a vast (surely windswept) terrace at the foot of a monstrous wall, crossed by tiny human figures, put there not to humanize the space or even to show the scale but simply to be dominated by that hugely impersonal elegance. "What Mies arrived at finally," says James Ingo Freed, "was a morality of building dissociated from a morality of use, or from a politics of use" (p. 190). An illustration of the Tugendhat house (1928-30) purports to show "children at play on the roof terrace" (p. 57). What we actually see is a little boy and a little girl, naked, at the far edge of the terrace, as far away as the photographer can put them. They are not playing. They are just standing there and looking toward the camera, being humiliated. The book certainly convinces one, if one needed convincing, of Mies's genius; but it adds up to a powerful defense of postmodernism. Or it would, if postmodernism with- out talent had not proved even more prone to "formula, sterility and out- right cheapness," in which the ingratiating approaches to the public are as patronizingly offensive as the inhumanity of the international school was coarsely insensitive and arrogant. Establishing a classical norm for architecture does not ensure that no other sorts of building will be designed, or that they will be inferior to what the norm prescribes. In particular, the politics that inspire museum officials</page><page sequence="13">Essay Review 85 do not necessarily promote the good, the beautiful, or the true. There are important kinds of building that seldom find their way into reviews like this one. One book the editor did not send me (perhaps he did not receive it, or kept it for himself) is David Naylor's American Picture Palaces: The Archi- tecture of Fantasy.5 But the extravagant settings designed by such architects as John Eberson and Thomas W. Lamb for the motion picture audiences of the first half of this century stagger the eye as they enthral the memory. "Attention," as Willy Loman's widow said, "must finally be paid" to such a building. They are kitsch, but "kitsch" is a word invented by self-righteous people who want to impose their own meager tastes on others and resent the fact that people go on doing things because they like to do them. "No more pitiful degradation of an art has ever been presented than the prosti- tution of architecture that goes on daily in the construction of these build- ings," said one critic in 1928.6 But what, exactly, is an "art"? This claim of preemptive moral status for a set of values whose ultimate ground is never properly shown is pure mystification. What Naylor describes is architecture by and for people who do not believe that architecture is exemplified by tombs and prisons, though the enemies of hedonism will insist that that the picture palaces were only the instruments of a more subtle slavery imposed by the culture industry. Within the more moralistic world to which the books actually reviewed here belong, dictatorial modernism is not the first attempt to erect a set of principles to replace the classical orders. For one thing, there was the "Gothic revival" exemplified by A. W. Pugin, absent from the books dealt with in this review but dealt with in its predecessor. But there were also theories that took their inspiration from an aspect of Vitruvius we have passed over, in which building practices are seen as evolving from the primitive shelters that humans first used to keep them from the elements. Such theories are exemplified for us by Gottfried SEMPER and VIOLLET-LE-DUC. The SEMPER volume consists of translations of his principal writings, long unfamiliar though SEMPER was a great man in his day, with an introduction by one of the translators and a preface by the editor of the series, Joseph Rykwert, the content of which seems inexplicable until one realizes that it is designed to correct the historical perspective that the introduction is about to impose. Seven items are translated, ranging from an early (1834) contri- bution to the controversy that then raged over the use of color in the sculp- ture and architecture of Greco-Roman antiquity, through a treatise on The Four Elements of Architecture, to excerpts from his later writing on style in relation to materials and processes. The interest, though great, is almost en- tirely of an antiquarian order. For our immediate purposes, most interest attaches to the "four elements" SEMPER treats as basic. The scope of his treat- ment is reminiscent of ALBERTI's clever but abstract list of six elements: locality, area, compartition, wall, roof, opening (ALBERTI, p. 8). SEMPER himself</page><page sequence="14">86 Francis Sparshott starts with the hearth, conceived as the mere fact of social compresence in a place (allied here with Frank Lloyd Wright's emphasis on a great central fireplace [see WILSON AND ROBINSON, pp. 121-22], and contrasted with Mies, who sees the inhabitants of his villas as always looking outward [SCHULZE, p. 55]). The second element is a roof, to keep the weather off the folk and the fire; third is wall, conceived as typically a hanging rug or woven screen; fourth is the mound, raising the hearth above flood level. It is a very simple, very sensible scheme, and highly original; we note especially the absence of defensive masonry, apparently because it is not basic to human dwelling that one should be under attack. In the later writings, the principle of masking comes to the fore: art pro- vides a screen behind which there is privacy. And the emphasis on the pri- ority of woven fabrics persists. Rykwert reminds us that SEMPER was, among other things, by profession a curator of textiles at the Austrian Mu- seum (p. vii). He was also a highly successful working architect, which may help to account for his respect for physical reality-a respect which made him later the butt of Alois Riegl. Riegl wrongly attacked him for a supposed materialistic determinism that led him to neglect the Kunstwollen, the over- mastering aesthetic impulse that Riegl thought of as directing the artistic productivity of an epoch regardless of material conditions. (In this, too, SEMPER is opposed to Mies, who according to Freed believed without expla- nation or justification in a single Zeitgeist [SCHULZE, p. 196]). Better remembered than SEMPER is Eugene-Emmanuel VIOLLET-LE-DUC, here represented by an engaging selection of short readings (from nine- teenth-century translations) and linking commentary by M. F. Hearn. The reviewer knows no reason to suppose that the task could have been better or more usefully performed. VIOLLET-LE-DUC is best remembered as an analyst, advocate, and restorer of the monuments of French Gothic, but his dauntingly voluminous and heterogeneous writings were essentially directed to establishing, ex- plaining, and promulgating the basic principles of structure. It was from this point of view that he became the principal inspiration of the new archi- tecture of France early in the present century. His actual analyses of Gothic buildings, for all their persuasive brilliance, suffered from erroneous beliefs in the elasticity of masonry (sees MARK, chapter 4), his excursions into func- tional uses of such new materials as cast iron turned out to be blind alleys, and his speculations in racial and cultural determinism are merely embar- rassing; but the passionate conviction and intellectual energy that he brings to his didactic enterprise still make it impossible to read him with indiffer- ence. His descriptions of Gothic structures are still exciting. Here is someone who has used his eyes, is excited by what he sees, thinks about it, and de- scribes and explains it with enthusiasm. What troubles us is his cocksureness.</page><page sequence="15">Essay Review 87 He lays down the law on everything with a tone of absolute certainty. In a way, the most characteristic of his writings are dialogues in which an adult lays down the law to children, or a master to disciples. Nothing seems to be left open to debate. A conjectural explanation of why Greek architects did not use vaults (pp. 65-66) which seems to be mere moonshine carries the same air of enthusiastic conviction as a persuasive analysis of the different ways in which Greek and late-Roman builders went about the coordination of usable spaces (pp. 67-86). The editor's method of juxtaposing short pas- sages from works differing widely in date and purpose makes this habit of mind startlingly and disconcertingly evident. Dogmatism such as this does not wear well. The editor courageously in- cludes a passage illustrating his extraordinary racial determinism, exempli- fied in such statements as "When the Aryans are found in contact with the Semites already mingled with the Hamites, there results from this union an art of a high degree of perfection" (p. 33), and culminating in the following injunction: "The time has come for us to say to humanity: 'Investigate your beginnings: you will thus learn your aptitudes, and will be able to pursue that path of true Progress to which your destiny calls you'" (p. 38). These judgments rest on a survey of worldwide practices in the construction of dwelling places, and Hearn truly says that it was a time when people were uninhibited in holding and expressing racist views, but the crassness with which VIOLLET-LE-DUC formulates his thumping generalizations is surely not representative of his age. It is a voice from the past, but a strongly indi- vidual voice. What most repays careful study today is probably the pro- found and challenging investigation of the problems of restoring ancient monuments (pp. 269-88). In one way, Robert MARK is very close to VIOLLET-LE-DUC, whose ideal of structural rationalism he endorses. But the temper of his book is very differ- ent, emphasizing the use of computer techniques and empirical observation to apply sound engineering to architectural problems. The reviewer found this book the most continuously enlightening of the works before him. One often wished for a fuller analysis and less abrupt judgment (the book ac- companies a television series, and its summary rhetoric may reflect this), but there are full reference notes for the unsatisfied. MARK deplores the way in which (as the story narrated by DE HAAN AND HAAGSMA showed) aesthetic judgments nowadays often rely on pictures and neglect structural realities. He is saddened by the fact that Boston's John Hancock Tower is praised by the critics and Chicago's John Hancock Center deplored, though the former was a technical disaster (wind forces were ignored, the windows fell out) and the latter's structural economy makes it "the Bourges Cathedral of the times" (pp. 7-10, 179). He is particu- larly incensed by the Sydney Opera House fiasco, where (according to him) the worst troubles arose from an indefensible notion miscalled "honesty"-</page><page sequence="16">88 Francis Sparshott the ludicrous demand that a design based on a freehand sketch without any thought of practicalities should nonetheless be made the prescription for a self-supporting structure. MARK is best known for his analysis (using ingeniously constructed mod- els) of the actual stresses operating in great buildings of the past, and the bulk of the present book presents material of that sort. To this reviewer, most surprising was the account of how Roman concrete domes (especially that of the Pantheon) worked. Instead of a sophisticated exploitation of the elastic properties of shells, as we used to be taught, the technology was simply that of a barrel arch; if the concrete cracked, a thicker bandage of concrete was slapped on. One of the most important points that MARK makes is that structural masterpieces like the Gothic cathedrals (Bourges being the paradigm) did not rely on structural analysis or theory, because none such was available; the architects relied on their experience of existing buildings, and, since they were always present at the building site, could revise the design to correct weaknesses as they became apparent. The art of drawing, on which VIOLLET-LE-DUC laid such emphasis and which plays such a dominant part in contemporary practice, belongs to the studio rather than to the site. The reduction of architecture to an art of drawing, to be completed be- fore the people in hard hats take over, appears most vividly in two books on the use of computers in design. This appearance is to some extent an ar- tifact of presentation; we are free to suppose that in real life computation and construction go hand in hand. But look at MITCHELL's preface: "To de- ploy [an architectural] language to solve functional problems is to build. But if there is, in addition, rhetorical intent and a concern for formal prop- erties, the building becomes architecture" (p. ix). The deployment of lan- guage spoken of in the first sentence is surely the planning of buildings rather than building, which is a matter of material disposition. The issue is crucial: hands-on procedures are in many ways not language-like. How- ever, it is absurd to think of architecture in a hands-on context today: a big modem building with its climate control and its elaborate mechanical and hydraulic systems clearly has to be thought through beforehand. Even so, a contributor to the MCCULLOUGH volume observes that "architectural deci- sions made in the absence of context are the legacy of the worst of the mod- ern movement" (p. 452), and he opines that the new computing tools must be used in conjunction with traditional methods if a critical stance is to be maintained. The two volumes before us take for granted the necessity of computer methods in the practicalities of the engineering aspects of architecture and the maintenance of coherence and consistency; their concern is the use of computers in the actual generation of designs. The MCCULLOUGH volume simply records the proceedings of a conference on theoretical and practical aspects of that topic. It is strictly for professionals, assuming familiarity with</page><page sequence="17">Essay Review 89 the field, and lay readers will often be lost. But it is a very rich volume, though uneven like all conferences, and yields much occasional interest and instruction. One notices that the European contributors tend to start by say- ing that of course computers are useless in the initial stages of generating new designs, when what one needs is original ideas and sound judgment; American contributors tend not to mention that. Omer Akin observes that CAD (Computer Assisted Design) neither replaces architecture nor merely facilitates it, but changes the way designing is done (p. 301). On immediate practical prospects, impressions differ: Fernando Catalano says that con- temporary practice makes the designer into an integral member of an elec- tronic workgroup, so that the graduate who cannot use computers will soon be unemployable (p. 313); but McIntosh and Pihlak report that their graduates find no market for their electronic skills in the Phoenix area, which is full of Luddites (p. 437). The overwhelming impression left by this volume is of how new the dis- cipline of CAD is. Before 1985 there was nothing at all. And considering how fast things are still developing in the information-handling world ev- erything in the book is probably ancient history already. Outsiders who want to get a grasp of CAD should turn rather to MITCHELL, who also provides introduction and conclusion to MCCULLOUGH. He is clearly accepted as doyen of the field, and his book is an impressive display of lu- cid intelligence. Readers must be ready to cope with sentences such as "A design operator is a function that evaluates to a new state of the design world" (p. 109), but everything is carefully explained, and this is indeed the sort of thing one has to come to terms with. People tell us that education is in a bad way, but computer literacy is really teaching everyone for the first time in the history of the world just what precision is. Mitchell's preface says his project is to "show how architectural lan- guages can be established, interpreted, and used" (p. ix), and adds that "the relation of criticism to design may be understood as a matter of truth-func- tional semantics of a critical language in a design world" (p. x). Philosophi- cal readers will recognize this as black humor, since truth-functional se- mantics for critical languages are notoriously hard to come by. MITCHELL knows what the joke is; but the task for CAD is to develop these notions as far and as thoroughly as the state of the art allows. He concludes by saying that "an architect's knowledge of the shapes and materials of available ele- ments and how to use them establishes a characteristic architectural lan- guage-a personal style.... Possession of a style is essential" (p. 239). But his account of style is weak and thin, and leaves one wondering how that concept can really be effectively accommodated within the procedures that he has so elegantly and insightfully developed. At a deeper level, these volumes on CAD may leave one wondering how such thinking is to accommodate SEMPER's emphasis on the central impor- tance of the hearth, together with its philosophical descendants, Heidegger's</page><page sequence="18">90 Francis Sparshott brooding on the concept of "dwelling" and Langer's idea that architecture as an art symbolizes the "ethnic domain."7 But perhaps all the users of CAD use it for is to design office buildings in which nobody lives. Much of the work surveyed here has centered on the notion that there is (at least, at a given place and time) just one right way of building, though this one way is variously identified. But the notion that there is only one right way is never seriously defended, and this fact lies behind the feeling most strongly voiced by Bataille, that architecture as such is oppressive. The situation is exacerbated in modernism, the movement prevalent in all the arts a few decades ago whereby the critical values applied to an art become internal to its own problems and procedures, cut off from the values of so- ciety and human life in general. Postmodernism as analyzed by JENCKS is, as the name suggests, a complex set of reactions against modernism-not as a style, but as a value system. The heart of postmodernism as thus conceived is that there are many goods, many ways of doing things, and that they are effectively rooted in history, which is our history and available for us. To break the force of modernism, this availability of history is essential: with- out it, we have nothing to set against the parameters and problematics of the unique "state of the art." In our information-soaked and pluralistic so- cieties, a building (or a novel) must bear many sorts of meaning for many sorts of minipublics, the naive and the scholarly, the aesthete and the hu- manist. Forms, symbolism, and history itself are used with great freedom, in a sort of serious play. Postmodernism gives a new turn to Schiller's old idea that art humanizes us by emancipating us from causal and moral im- peratives. In architecture especially, postmodernism emphasizes a build- ing's relation to its human and physical surroundings rather than its quality as a monument-though there is a risk (freely pointed out by its critics) merely to play at these relationships rather than to enter into them effec- tively. JENCKS's account of postmodernism is brilliant and complex, but an overview of the other books reviewed here makes the movement persua- sive in a way that his own arguments cannot. JENCKS winds up his book by listing eleven "rules" or "canons" derived by a loose induction from his treatment (pp. 331-46). Actually they are in no sense rules, they are merely tendencies. And it is not clear to me just how these tendencies cohere as a single movement rather than separately char- acterizing buildings that represent widely differing tastes and programs, united only by their being conspicuously not in the International Style. JENCKS's book is full of intelligence, observation, insight, originality, and other good things, but as a whole it reads oddly. Essentially it is in four parts. The first, an overview of postmodernism as a philosophical position, is not among the more enlightening of the many treatments of the topic. The second part reviews what he calls postmodernist painting. The paint-</page><page sequence="19">Essay Review 91 ings collected and reproduced can mostly be seen to relate to one or more of the eleven "canons," but left this reviewer unconvinced that they represent a single movement and can be most usefully discussed in this context. The idea of "classicism" is invoked, but one is moved to protest that there is more to classicism than pastiches of Raphael Mengs. The third part is the account of architecture, and is much the best part of the book: here, JENCKS's touch is sure and his argument persuasive even where one is not actually persuaded. Perhaps he would have done better not to support his case by pictures and descriptions of the "thematic house" designed by himself and his associates, which may not impress the reader as a favorable example of anything; but he deserves credit for putting his pencil where his mouth is. Then, the fourth part of the book sums up the argument in his elevenfold criteriology. This is admittedly ad hoc, but even so it is an ambitious proj- ect, and is less clearly and convincingly presented than it needs to be. And throughout the whole book there is the apparent claim that he, Charles JENCKS, personally invented postmodernist architecture by his speaking and writing, so that it is within his power to decree what it is and what it should become. Surely he cannot intend to leave that impression, but he does. Per- haps it is true. Where does all this leave us? In architecture as in other arts, those who become leading practitioners are presumably drawn to the practice by spe- cial interest in and sensitivity to its possibilities, their skills developed and enhanced by specific experience and instruction and by working in the field and in the world to which it relates. Styles are developed on the basis of spe- cific experience, in relation to specific demands and opportunities. Rules, codes, fashions, and "schools" can modify but cannot negate this indefea- sible multiplicity. Inferior architecture is likely to be less the product of wrong ideas than of weak sensibility, idleness and inattentiveness, irre- sponsibility, and simple defeat by authorities and markets in a position to impose inappropriate demands. The books reviewed here cumulatively overwhelm the reviewer by the intelligence, the industry, the brilliance, and energy they represent, no less than by the diverse splendor of what they show and describe. They help us to think and see and show us what there is to see and think about. Where many of them forfeit our confidence is where they imply that what they are telling us is the truth, that their theories and arrangements should perma- nently displace from our minds alternative ideas. That is what worried TAFURI about architectural history, though he himself wields a forceful rhe- torical intimidation. A large and relevant part of aesthetic education must be instruction in the rhetoric of critics and historians, and other functionaries of the art world: to recognize who is teasing, who is blustering, who is argu- ing, who is suggesting, who is seducing. Especially when they are promoting</page><page sequence="20">92 Francis Sparshott what are supposed to be timeless principles and objective values, we do well to apply the old touchstone: would you buy a used car from this pundit?
