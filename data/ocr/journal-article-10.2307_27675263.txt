<plain_text><page sequence="1">Werner Jaeger: Paideia. Die Formung des Griechischen Menschen. Bd. 1. Berlin: de Gruyter 1934. 513 S. 8 M. This massive volume (which reaches to the end of the fifth century B.C., and is to be followed by a second volume dealing with the fourth) contains an evolutionary study of Hellenic civilisation, based upon Greek literature, and designed from what we may call an ?anthropo centric? point of view. The aim of the writer is to discover first the (ddea? of man (f) l??a rov ?vtJq ncvov) which was gradually evolved by the Greeks, and secondly their conception of the proper means for shaping the actual stuff of humanity into conformity with this ?idea?. Behind this aim there lies the assumption that there is still in Europe today an ((Hellenocentric? circle of nations which starts its spiritual history with the Greeks, and draws its inspiration from the Greeks. It follows that if we can disengage the Greek ?idea? of man, and understand the Greek conception of the proper methods of shaping man (nMrrecv rov av&amp;q nov), we are learning lessons which are of deep and practical value for our own lives. From this point of view the work is addressed, as the writer says in his preface, ?not only to the learned world, but also to all who, in the struggle of our times for the maintenance of a culture which goes back thousands of years, are seeking again to-day the entrance to Hellenism?. In effect, therefore, Professor Jaeger has written the first volume of a work on the history of Greek Humanism, and he has written it with a deep feeling of its relevance to modern life and modern problems. This is a feeling which is present to many of us also in England. We are an insular people ; we are also a commercial people ; and a critic might well say that we are outside the Hellenocentric circle of Europe. But we have been attempting, for a good many years, to work out an ideal of citizenship and a practice of democracy; and we have looked again and again to the guidance of the Greeks, who trod the same path before us. Perhaps there is nothing in the classics which is more fre quently quoted in England than the funeral speech of Pericles, as it is reported in the pages of Thucydides. One of the greatest of our Greek scholars, Professor Murray, has written that ?if you take English poli tical thought and action from Pitt and Eox onwards, it seems to me that you will always find present strands of feeling which are due ? of course among many other causes ? to the germination of Greek influence?. Gnomon 1935 22</page><page sequence="2">338 Gnomon 1935 Perhaps we all take from the Greeks what we need, or what is congenial to us. Professor Jaeger writes for Germany; and his use of terms, and his emphasis, are those which are natural to a German scholar living and writing in the present stage of German life. He speaks, for example, ?of a coming third Humanism? which will be based on the Greek idea of the character of man as a political being, and will recognise the close interconnection between productive spiritual life and the life of the community. That is contemporary German speech; it is a giving of the blood of the present to the ghosts of the Greek past. But then, as we learn from the Odyssey, ghosts must be given blood before they can talk with us, and the only blood we can give them is that of our own contemporary life. That is perhaps the reason why each age gets different speech from the ghosts of Hellas. Each age pours out for them its own peculiar libation. What have the ghosts to say to the author of this book ? They tell him a story of development. They know to whom they are talking: they know that Professor Jaeger, when he wrote a work on Aristotle, in 1923, sought first and foremost to give a history of the development of Aristotle's thought. In this book, therefore, they seek to tell the history of the development of Greek ideas about man, and the proper excellence of man, and the means of attaining that excellence. The volume is divided into two books. In the first, and larger, of the two books the voices of ?the Greek morning? speak ? the voices of the age before the Persian wars. Homer and the literature of the Homeric age tell the story of the aristocratic or knightly conception of excellence which was developed in the heroic age ? a conception analogous to that of our own Middle Ages and their romances. Tyrtaeus takes up the tale, and tells us next of the Spartan conception, which made a whole people into a people of stern knights. The voices of Ionia succeed : we learn from the Ionic cities and their writers how there was built the conception of a Polis based upon law, with its own type of civic excellence, and how, simultaneously, there also emerged, in Ionic Aeolian poetry, the conception of the free individual freely shaping his tastes and forming his own personality. Next we hear the voice of Solon ? the grave and measured voice of Athens ? proclaiming evvofjtta, and teaching the higher unity in which civic excellence and the claims of individual personality are blended and reconciled. Thus we are led eventually (after we have heard the speech of the Ionian philosophers, and the poems of Theognis and Pindar which celebrate the idea of the 'gentleman' in the aristocratic circles of a later age) to the theme of the second book. Here we hear the great ghosts who once lived at ?the zenith and crisis of the Attic spirit?: we learn the</page><page sequence="3">E. Barker: Jaeger, Paideia 339 ideas of human excellence which inspired the Athenian dramatists of the fifth century, or were proclaimed by the Sophists, or were enun ciated in the historical philosophy of Thucydides. It will be seen that the history of ?the formation of the Greek man?, as it is presented in these pages, is a history drawn from Greek litera ture ? that it is, in effect, an interpretation of the content and spirit of Greek literature, and especially of Greek poetic literature. To under stand early Sparta, Professor Jaeger goes to the poetry of Tyrtaeus; to understand early Athens, he goes to that of Solon. He feels that it is only from literature ? literature in the specific sense of the word ? that we can learn to penetrate into the Greek mind. It has been the will of history that (apart from monuments of art, which belong to the sphere of decoration rather than to that of the education of humanity) poetic literature should be the one thing which has survived to us from the centuries before the classical age. We are fortunate in our inheritance ; devouring time has left us the essential material which we need to understand the Greek ?idea? of man in its true and ideal form ? the material of poetry. We may not possess the laws of Solon : we possess what, for the history of Greek culture and the formation of the Greek man, is even greater ? some of his poems. ?For us?, writes Professor Jaeger, ?it is the poet Solon who comes into the foreground.? There is something in this attitude which is reminiscent of two great English writers ? the philosopher Bacon and the poet Shelley. Bacon, in his ?Advancement of Learning?, celebrates poetry because it depicts a more ample greatness and a more exact goodness than can be found in the nature of things. Shelley, in his ?Defence of Poetry?, contends that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world. Like Bacon, Professor Jaeger would draw the picture of a more exact goodness (or true ?qerrj) from the poets. Like Shelley, he would make the poet Solon a greater legislator by his poems than he was by his laws them selves. Poetry is not, it is true, the whole of Professor Jaeger's material. He has studied the Ionian philosophers, the Sophists, and Thucydides, as well as the poets. One of his best sections (that on ?the Law-State and its ideal of the citizen?) is built upon a study of legal ideas and terms, such as the great term ?cxacoovvrj, rather than upon poetic material. But his main investigation is an investigation of poetry secular and human poetry; and the fact suggests two reflections. The first is that poetry, though it takes us into an ampler air (amplior hos campos aether et lumine vestit Purpureo), does not tell us what men actually felt or how they really acted. It is good to know the poetry of Tyrtaeus and Solon; and Professor Jaeger elucidates with a glow 22*</page><page sequence="4">340 Gnomon 1935 of poetic enthusiasm the sense and the significance of such poetry. But we should not really know the true nature of mediaeval feudalism if we took the 'Chanson de Roland' for our guide ; and in the same way we do not know ? we can only dimly guess ? the nature of early Sparta from the poems of Tyrtaeus. Perhaps Professor Jaeger exalts too much the value of his poetic material and the significance of its lessons. When he says, for example, that ?the noble elevation of fraternal feeling for every human being, and the strength of compassion which it evinces?, make one of Solon's poems ?the most personal document among all surviving political fragments?, he seems to allow the warmth and glow of his own interpretation to colour 'with a purple light' the theme of which he treats. The second reflection which is suggested by the writer's use of Greek poetic material springs from the fact that this poetry is, in the main, anthropocentric. It turns on man and his splendour, his struggle and his achievement. The great text is that of Sophocles: nokk? r? ?stv? xov??v ?v?gdmov ?sivoregov n?ket. This is the note of all great ages of Humanism. It is the note we find in a fine passage of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' ? ?What a piece of work is a man ! . . . the beauty of the world ! the paragon of animals!? Now it is true that poetry which turns on the greatness and splendour of man is the natural basis for a study of the formation of the idea of man ; and Professor Jaeger, in view of his theme, is perfectly justified in making use of this material. Is is true, too, that the Greeks were deeply affected and shaped by their poetry ; we cannot understand the shaping and the formation of the Greek man without taking into account the influence, for example, of Homer. But man is a mixed sort of being. He shapes himself indeed by his poetry; and he expresses in his poetry the ideas by which he shapes himself. But he is also an animal living in an economic environment, acting upon it and acted upon by it. The formation of the Greek man owed some thing to the 'airs and waters and places' among which he lived; and there is an Hippocratic treatise which shows that the Greeks were aware of this influence. (Perhaps the Hippocratic treatises will come under review in the second of Professor Jaeger's volumes: at any rate they have their importance in regard to his problem.) But there are also other, and higher, influences than 'airs and waters and places'. There is, above all, the influence of religion and religious ideas. Man is a religious as well as an economic being; and he is also shaped by his religion. We have to be 'theocentric' as well as 'anthropocentric' -? even in dealing with the Greeks. What had mysteries and oracles to do with the shaping of the Greek man ? What was the voice which came from Delphi ? How far must we take into account priests (who, like the</page><page sequence="5">E. Barker : Jaeger, Paideia 341 Asclepiads of the school of Hippocrates, had much to do with the hand ling of men), besides the Ttocrrzal and the nohrcxoc and the qjcIoooojol who have bequeathed to us their verses and writings ? In a word, how far was the formation of the Greek man guided by ro ?ecov ? or at any rate by his ideas about ro ?ecov ? Here we touch a fundamental question which we must ask about the Greeks ? whether there was not, behind the poet, the figure of the prophet; whether there was not, behind Greek literature, some other force and power. It is a question which one of our English poets, who was also a teacher of the classics at one of our great English schools, has asked, in a poem called ??Israel and Hellas?. But was it all, the utmost of their reach, That unto us the sedulous scribe has passed ? To carve on marble-slabs of that great speech Great thoughts, that so might last ? Was that the single aim their copious souls forecast ? It is too large a question to be dealt with here. We must admit, indeed, that in comparison with theocentric Israel Hellas was anthropocentric, and even anthropomorphic, in its thought. The Greeks often tended to imagine the world in the image of man ; and Professor Jaeger justly notes, for example, how Anaximander transfers the idea of Acxrj from the social life of the polis into the order of nature, and seeks to explain the law and order of the natural world by the law and order of the human world. But this transference works both ways; and it was also possible for Greek thinkers to seek to explain the order of the human world as an imitation and copy of the natural. Thus Euripides can argue (Phoenissae 538?551) that the example of nature, in which night and day inter change equally in their yearly course, suggests to man that there should be equality and interchange of office in the State. Man, after all, is not always the hub of creation to the Greek mind. Some few words may perhaps be said, in conclusion, on points of detail. There is one matter of detail which seems trivial, and yet is perhaps of some importance. There is no index to Professor Jaeger's volume (no doubt it will come in the second volume, but it is needed already in first) : there is no indication, at the top of each page, of the general theme treated; there is no numbering of the chapters in the two parts. These are omissions which make reference difficult. The effect on the reader's mind is that of a number of essays, with a connection or avv??ac? which is ecqojLcevrj rather than ovvearqajbcjuevrj. Another matter of detail is related to our English scholarship. A number of English scholars ? in particular Professor Gilbert Murray and his colleagues at Oxford ? have written works during recent years on the history and signifi</page><page sequence="6">342 Gnomon 1935 canee of Greek paideia. One may mention Sir Richard Livingstone's book on ?The Greek Genius and its Meaning to us?, and the volume of essays, entitled ?The Legacy of Greece?, which was published by the Oxford Press in 1921. They deserve mention, because they relate the Greek past to the living present of to-day, and because they contain a treatment of Greek culture as an active force in contemporary English life. No doubt they are known to Professor Jaeger, who is well verted in the writings of English Scholars; but some indication and appre ciation of their argument might have been useful to his readers. The Greek man, when the idea of his nature had been fully deve loped (enstor) rr)v eavrov cpvotv ?oyev, as Aristotle might say), was after all something more than Greek. He was also, as Professor Jaeger himself argues, universal. Just for that reason, and in order to under stand his universality, it is good for us all, in our different countries, to realize and to explain how he appeals to the scholars and writers of other countries.
