BORGATTI guage and trace their ori- gins to the Edo kingdom of Benin in their orthodox his- tory. Nevertheless, they and other northern Edo peoples living in eastern Nigeria's Etsako local government area share such cultural in- stitutions as title associations and mask- ing traditions with their riverain Igala and Igbo neighbors, who live to the east, across the Niger River. Masking tradi- tions tend to be associated with age sets, as among the northern Igbo, and ObL 10? stylistically the masquerades reflect east- ern prototypes. Horned masks symbol- ize male aggression; carved wooden or appliqued cloth masks display elabo- rately coiffed hairstyles of nineteenth- century maidens; and "tall ghosts" made of fabric represent senior ancestors. The very eclecticism of eastern Etsako masks evokes an Igbo rather than an Edo model. The masquerades, their context, and the languages associated with them suggest a continuum of age-grade masking tradi- tions from the east bank to the west bank of the Niger, and indicate greater com- plexity in the cultural background of the Ekperi and their neighbors than the orthodox history allows.

Ogumogu is among the vast range of masquer- ades performed among the Ekperi during the Otsa festival or when called upon to provide a spec- tacular display; for example, Ekperi's version of this masquerade performed at the National Mu- seum in Lagos in the fall of 1971. As seen here, it is also danced in neighboring Uwepa-Uwano communities during their annual Ukpe festival, when it was said to perform on behalf of the health and well-being of their children (fieldnotes, Oct. 9, 1972). Many Ekperi masquerades demonstrate striking parallels with masquerades of the Igala and Igbo to the east. Opposite page: 2.

Udaba acquired this mask, with wrestlers grap- pling between the horns, from East Central State in 1969 to replace an older Idu mask that had de- teriorated and become unusable. Whether that mask was a composite mask like the one illus- trated in Figure 1 1c is not clear. 40 african arts - winter 2003</page><page sequence="2">--i ,, . . .. i i i i "7' I, ii `"~- I a ; li ;?? -:[fs T~i</page><page sequence="3">Today numbering about 15,000 or more, the Ekperi occupy settlements dispersed over 400 square miles west of the Niger River in the southeastern corner of Etsako local government area in Edo State. Benin City is some 70 miles to the north, but Idah, the Igala capital, is only 15-20 miles to the west, located on the opposite bank of the Niger. The Ekperi claim to have migrated from Benin in the early sixteenth century during the Benin civil war known as Okwu-Oba (Alonokua n.d.:3). Local histories further suggest that they and the neighboring Uzairhue, Avianwu, and Uwepa-Uwano descend from a common Edo ancestor, Oluku (Bradbury 1957:103). At the time of Ekperi's departure from Benin, Benin and Idah were engaged in open warfare, and both kingdoms record the settlement of fringe areas in the af- termath of conflict (Boston 1962:380-81; Dike 1976: 6/2-5). The prevalence of night societies and title systems like those of the Igala and Igbo suggests that a local population inhabiting the area prior to the sixteenth century absorbed Igala in- fluence (Eboreime 1978:2; see also Bor- gatti 1976c, 1979c, 1989). Peacetime activities resulted in even greater cross-cultural communication among the peoples living along the Niger, for the river served as a major highway to the coast. The Igala capital at Idah faces the northern Edo settlement of Agenebode (Uwepa-Uwano) on the opposite bank, and what is now the Ekperi area is said to mark a point on the border between Edo and Igala authority prior to the Idah war of 1515 (Eboreime 1978:2). Furthermore, the Igala were a nautical people who regularly traveled downriver to trade. Elizabeth Isichei notes that they often This page: 3.

The dance's name refers to the uncertainty of life, like the danger inherent in the performance. Itsunoya from Ugbekpe-Ekperi saw it when he was in the army in the Ishan communities of Ubiaja or Uromi, and brought it home. It was commissioned to perform in the Otsa festival by Iviakpera Quar- ter (fieldnotes, Jan. 10, 1973). Opposite page: Top: 4. Opili masquerade. Udaba-Ekperi, No- vember 14, 1972. Photo: Jean M.

Agulese, a version of the widely distributed cloth applique masquerade known as Okakagbe, ex- emplifies how masquerades, once introduced, may be traded extensively, so that there may be numerous secondary points of distribution. This Agulese was sponsored by Treman Atokai and sewn by John Idawo in 1972.

From this it was but a short step to permanent settlements. Indeed, a whole chain of Niger Igbo towns claim Igala origins, as Ossomari does, or like llah, have quarters that trace descent from Igala. Both of those communities use masquerades that retain Igala as a spoken language (Isichei 1976:54-55).1 A process of settlement and resettle- ment along the Niger continued into the nineteenth century. R. E. Bradbury points out that the "multiplicity of settle- ment in the relatively small Ekperi tribe is due to scattering, during the last cen- tury, by Nupe raiders" (1957:100). As one local historian notes, villagers fled "to the high forested Elephant country lying to the south" (Alonokua n.d.:4). Thus, correspondence was broken between ter- ritorial groups and descent units-facili- tating cultural change and innovation. Certainly, many cults throughout the area date from this period, having as their purpose the protection of the communi- ty from the depredations of war (Borgatti 1976b:60-61). Masquerade Types The Ekperi annually celebrate the feast of Otsa to purify the land and reinforce community solidarity. Every three years, new masquerades are introduced as an elaboration to mark the formation of the boys' age company that occurs at this time.2 I observed Otsa festivals in three Ekperi communities between 1972 and 1973: Azukhala, Ugbekpe, and Udaba. I collected information on the sequence of events and data on masks in Ogonochi and Osomegbe as well, photographing Otsa festival masks, but not in perfor- mance context.3 Responsible citizens sponsor the mas- querades for Otsa that are performed by the members of the dance society called the Igbokobia. Depending upon available resources, festival congregations, orga- nized by quarter, create one or two new masked performances. Consequently, each lk congregation builds up a repertoire of images that may be drawn upon in suc- ceeding festivals. Thirty or more masked performances may take place during the three days of public celebration that mark the end of the Otsa festival period. Six months before a major festival, or Big Otsa, the head of the dance group, Ogakpogu (Keeper of the Great Gong), or his council-twenty or thirty young adults from the previous age group, and the dancers who form the Igbokobia- decide how much money should be col- lected from each adult. Although mask- ing is primarily a male occupation, Ekperi women also play important roles. They serve as "mothers" who sponsor new plays and as supporters who perform in concert between masquerade plays. The position of "mother" varies from con- gregation to congregation, however. In Ugbekpe-Ekperi's Ogienokhwa Quarter, it is inherited; the "mother," as a pub- lic representative for the masqueraders during the festival, is approached by women who would like to make votive offerings.4 In Azukhala-Ekperi, members of the dance society appoint important women to be mothers of new masquer- ades, making them financially responsi- ble for costuming and other costs. During the festival, the "mothers" come to the dance area with their masquerades to sprinkle chalk and water, symbolizing peace and good luck, and to collect gifts on behalf of the masqueraders.5 Emphasis on change and innovation obscures the earlier history of the festival. Members of the Igbokobia range widely in search of new forms, going west to winter 2003 - african arts 43</page><page sequence="5">Igarra, north to Igbira, east to Igala, and southeast into Igbo country-any neigh- boring place. They commission costumes, pay to learn the dance and associated medicines, and then make their presen- tation.6 For example, Ugbekpe-Ekperi's Ogumogu (Fig. 1), a fabric-covered col- lapsible set of circular ribs, like a "slinky," that changes height and diameter in per- formance, has Igala antecedents7; Tide Na Wa (Fig. 3), also known as Agadogu, a high-wire act, comes from Ishans; and Udaba-Ekperi sources maintain that Opili (Fig. 4), a masquerade that wears a flat, white wooden face mask and an elabo- rate embroidered Hausa robe, reflects its Urhobo origins in both name and aspect.9 Once introduced, masquerades are traded extensively so there may be nu- merous secondary points of distribu- tion. Azukhala-Ekperi's Agulese (Fig. 5), for example, is a version of the widely distributed cloth applique masquerade known as Okakagbe (Borgatti 1979b). In 1972 Azukhala negotiated for the rights to this masquerade in Aigyere, a neigh- boring northern Edo (Uwepa-Uwano) community. The people of Aigyere them- selves had acquired it from the southern- most riverain Ekperi community, Udaba, which in turn had borrowed it from nearby Igala sources.10 Preliminary Masquerades Although a multiplicity of masquerades perform during Otsa, certain key images set the tone for different phases of the festival and provide themes on which numerous masquerades will play as "vari- ations." Historically, the towering Umese (Fig. 6) is the senior masquerade in any Ekperi community, and the "owner" of the forest sanctuary called okula. A "tall ghost" clad in locally woven cloth, Umese travels from house to house on Otsa eve- singing, dancing, and collecting alms or offerings to clear the way for the day- light masquerades."1 The fact that it sings in Igbira suggests an Igbira derivation, although the mask type itself is wide- spread, its distribution following the paths of the Niger and the Benue Rivers.12 Youthful Egbemamu masqueraders wearing ragged cloth masks and cos- tumes open the first full day of dancing (Fig. 7). According to sources in Ugbekpe- Ekperi, the costumes are made by old men who invest them with special med- ication (ixhumi) that protects the dancers from injury or disgrace during perfor- mance.13 Not only does the dancing of the Egbemamu prevent untoward oc- currences during the performance, but it provides protection for the community during the year to come. The dancing of young boys activates that power, given the costumes by the elders who make them. Whipping masquerades Akpele and Ekpenike, so called because they chase youngsters with whips, follow Egbema- mu. Akpele wears a haystack-style cos- tume and features a crownlike headdress constructed of tubes wrapped in cloth and colored fiber.14 Similarly clothed, Ek- penike has a detachable wooden mask and a surmounting headdress that sym- bolizes a long-beaked bird. Ekperi people consider both Egbemamu (also known as Anume-e) and Akpele to be indigenous forms. Ekpenike is thought to derive from elsewhere. Ekpenike from Azukhala- Ekperi's Iviakpera Quarter has a head- piece that was carved by Idawo around 1942 (Fig. 8).15 It was one of the few older extant wooden images remaining in use among the Ekperi in the 1970s, others having been sold to Phillip Allison for Nigeria's Antiquities Department, now the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, a decade earlierl6 or having been lost in village house fires. The bird called obiakana in the Ekperi language symbolizes supernatural power rather than physical force, unlike the masks that come out on the following day, for it fear- lessly approaches the dead to remove their eyes.17 More aggressive and individualized masqueraders wearing grotesque carved wooden masks or cloth hoods come out early on the second day. Many of these masks are in the style of the Ibibio carv- ing center Ikot Ekpene, although they may actually be locally made. They bear names like Ojieka (Fig. 9a) or Akpa- tanudo, suggesting power (Fig. 9b), or Ichioba (Figs. 10a, b), a term said to be of Igbo derivation.8s Groups of young men accompany these masked figures from house to house, gathering small gifts of money and foodstuffs for the mas- querade society. Such preliminary per- formances serve to generate excitement Iz" 44</page><page sequence="6">4"A" Ali /*b in the community for the more formal and choreographed displays held in the later afternoon.

They feature a cloth or wooden mask with an elaborate coiffure and (ideally) an appliqued and embroidered body suit embellished with various overcloths or wrappers, most notably the handwoven title cloth worn by men and women at piv- otal points during their lives (Borgatti 1983: figs. 25-27). Anumee takes this form, although in one version its coiffure is made up of multiple Ikot Ekpene face masks, including a Mammy Watah variant, at- tached to a cloth superstructure.21 Other such masquerades include the Pregnant or Waddling Woman called Oyepete (which incorporates medicine for helping barren women) as well as other female characters like Adza and Aiyegu (which dance for old women and small children respectively). Ugbekpe's Aiyegu, which I documented in 1972, featured appropriately a complex headdress with many children's dolls.22 They included both locally made plastic dolls in primary colors and, attached to the central carving, a Caucasian "Barbie" type representing Mammy Watah, carved in the Ikot Ekpene style.23 Some performances honor individu- als or groups. Chief Who Rides a Horse (Egu Akachi), a construction in cloth, is an elders' masquerade that blesses the congregation as a whole (Fig. 13).24 Egu Ogakpogu, an anthropomorphic cloth masquerade, honors the dance society leader, the Keeper of the Great Gong (gong=kpogu.)25 Others, like the Insuffer- able Wife, Amugbeme (Fig. 12; another version illustrated in Borgatti 1983: fig. 27), or Morning Sunrise, Ekuede (Fig. 14a), provide a vehicle for social and aes- thetic comment. The fat belly of the self- ish wife rebukes those women who want to monopolize their husbands' resources and prevent them from taking addition- al wives.26 Morning Sunrise (Fig. 14b), a sobriquet for newlyweds, appears to be a praise name referring to the elegance of the pair of crest masks so designated, which fea- ture elaborately curled extensions from the heads that suggest both horns and coiffures.

Such masquerades in- clude variations on the cloth applique type called Okakagbe that was introduced from Ibaji, the Igbo-Igala borderland on the east bank of the Niger, in the 1930s (see Borgatti 1979b); Mammy Watah variants with carved wooden headdresses in the style of Ikot Ekpene (Figs. 15, 16a, b); the Igala-derived "wonder" masquerade (Ogumogu)-a collapsible cloth tube stretched over circular cane ribs (Fig. 1); or the Ishan-derived high-wire acrobatic act Tide Na Wa (Fig. 3) that astounded audiences in the early 1970s. Other Masks A number of masks are variations of form, while some play with thematic con- cepts. There are tall masks like Afulele and Ulogobia that recall the tall ghost Umese (Fig. 6) and the past but, in the case of Afulele (Taller than Tall; Figs. 17a, b), draw on contemporary imagery and materials by incorporating silk scarves and numerous objects from the market- place into elaborate constructions.29 Other masquerades play upon the theme of male force and aggression. Ugwono (Fig. 18), Tiger,30 wears a knit striped body costume like that worn by Ngbe, the "leop- ard" society masqueraders from the Ejag- ham people of the Cross River area of southeastern Nigeria (Thompson 1974: color pl. VIII); it has a hood to which horns and feathers are attached.3' Ugbo- kolo or Ukpokolo, Boxer, is described as wearing a knit body suit, too, along with a simple wooden face mask bearing horns, at least in an Azukhala-Ekperi ex- ample (Fig. 19) said to have been carved by Idaiwo-Ulogho circa 1952.32 Udaba- Ekperi's Egu Akana (Fig. 2), also referred to as Idu, features a well-carved mask with a pair of wrestlers grappling be- tween the horns.33 Still others provide the means for including groups of children in the performance. They carry names like Ilitsu, Locusts,34 or Ikpule, a sack that carries corn, beans, or groundnuts, its multiple uses referring to the many chil- dren who play this masquerade during the festival.35 Regional Parallels The origins of the masquerade associa- tion, Igbokobia, present an interesting historical problem. Among the Ekperi, masking is clearly linked with age-set formation and group socialization. This is also the case among the northern and Onitsha Igbo, where "costumes are dif- ferentiated in form according to the age of the ghost represented, and the physical and behavioral characteristics displayed correlate closely with charac- teristics attributed to persons of these ages" (Henderson 1972:349). The Ekperi name Igbokobia suggests an Igbo deriva- tion and recalls the Onitsha term okolobia that refers to the young adult status acquired by the age set fully inducted into the collective incarnate dead (Hen- This page: 15. Aye Omosi featuring a Mammy Watah image, on the third day of Otsa. Ogienokhwa Quarter, Ugbekpe-Ekperi, 1972. Photo: Jean M. Borgatti (slide 72.29.3). An elaborate masquerade consisting of the adult masquerader pictured here and a child mas- querader, Aye Omosi signifies the end of the fes- tival. It is said to have been made by Gabriel Irenaye circa 1948. In this case "made" may refer to putting together the masquerade ensem- ble, with the carved crest purchased outside and the costume made locally, Alternatively, it may refer to a masquerade initially created at that time but refurbished at a later date with a new headdress.

Igbo, Igala, Ekperi, and other northern Edo groups refer to the forest sanctuaries associated with these masquerades by cognate terms--okula in Ekperi, okula in Igala (Boston 1968:130), okwule in Igbo (Henderson 1972:348; Osadebe 1981:11)- in contrast with the Edo cognate ogwa or egwa used in Bini contexts and in associ- ation with some northern Edo shrines (Bradbury 1973:190, 203; Borgatti 1976c:26; 1979c:576-77). A consideration of Ekperi masking tra- ditions further shows that numerous forms, key images as well as recent intro- ductions, parallel shared Igbo and Igala ones.36 Umese is part of a widespread complex of tall ghosts, elderly and ven- erated forms of incarnate dead, found among the Igala, Igbira, Idoma, Igbo, and northern Edo (Borgatti 1979c:576-77, pl. 5; Boston 1968: pl. 8; Henderson 1972:349; Bassing 1973: pls. 2,3; Kasfir 1979; Picton 40e rr --~~ 7~Y / I~ 52</page><page sequence="14">n.d. and personal communication, circa 1971). In the Ekperi area, the master flute player (ufele) directs the personified spirits or masquerades with his music (Fig. 20). The tones of the arrow flute (ote ufele) represent the incarnate dead among the Onitsha Igbo as well (Henderson 1972:357). Ekperi's Agaba Idu or Idu, the mythical bush monster (Figs. 11a-c), is a type like- wise associated with warrior age sets among the northern Igbo. Other transi- tional forms comparable to the Ojieka (Fig. 9) and Ichioba (Figs. 10a, b), described earlier, symbolize male aggression for younger men. Akpele and Ekpenike (Fig. 8) parallel northern Igbo whipping mas- querades with their billowing fiber cos- tumes and bird symbolism (Boston 1960a; Henderson 1972:351). Ekperi masquer- ades depicting women follow forms best known in the literature as Igbo or Ibibio "maiden" masks. To be sure, the head- dresses of many of these masquerades 4r ;ON A TV x\.~ s~?

The female chorus sings for the Dance from Asaba: "Egu Asaba lo usago" ("Asaba Dance, come out so we can see you") and "Onacho Igbo (The spirit has come from Igbo for a visit").38 "Egu," meaning "spir- it" or "dance," relates to the Igala Egwu. Other Ekperi terms referencing "spirit" or "masquerade," Aihmi and Alimi, are cognate with the Edo Erinbhin (spiri- tual realm). The Entertainment Factor The masks of Ekperi's Otsa feast manifest a quest for novelty or variety that appears at odds with the stereotype of conser- vatism in much African art as we know it from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Similarly, a strong component of pure entertainment that runs through Ekperi's masquerade displays runs count- er to an emphasis on ritual focus found in much of the research on African art, even though distinct masquerades are said to perform on behalf of specific segments of the community. Thus the focus of the mas- querades appears to be more aesthetic than ritual, as, according to John Boston, masking among the Nri-Awka focused on drama rather than religion. Boston wrote in 1960 that this seemed to be a phenome- non of long standing and not a recent development (Boston 1960a:56). In Ekperi, considerable energy is directed toward making medicine to ensure correct perfor- mance and to mitigate conditions that might harm the illusions presented for the delight of the audience.39 Both an interest in change as a cultural attitude and a focus on drama are more associated with Igbo than Edo in the literature. Initiation into the dance society does not appear to be rigorous, a matter only of a small fee. To enter the okula, the soci- ety's forest sanctuary, an individual who has joined an age company pays a mem- bership fee of 50 kobo (about 75 cents in 1972). Members of the Igbokobia range in age from those who have joined an age company (at 12 or 13 years of age) to those who are older, the upper age limit being defined by interest and agility. Each dance society has a village shrine in the house of the society head and a forest sanctuary where matters pertaining to the masquerades are discussed.40 The protocol of performance further emphasizes the aesthetic component. Most of the larger villages divide into two sec- tors, usually based on quarters, to present masquerades. The performance areas are contiguous and the two sectors stagger their performances so that spectators must run back and forth between the playing grounds to view the spectacle. Such competition makes for a more excit- " 1 t I BI .,~bS ing performance: each sector tries to pre- sent more numerous and more elaborate masquerades, and dancers try to outdo one another.41 For example, in Azukhala- Ekperi, Ivionima Quarter's masquerade called Agulese (Fig. 21), a name that means simply "Our Own Power," fea- tures a superstructure of plastic dolls and toys. It was introduced in 1972 as the competitor of Iviakpera Quarter's new masquerade, also called Agulese (Fig. 5), based on the Okakagbe ensemble intro- duced with such success back in the 1930s (Borgatti 1979b). Processions of women and girls cheer on performers between appearances, singing praise songs, danc- ing, and clapping.42 An interesting sidelight on the Ekperi attitude toward competition was found in the answer to questions that I repeated- ly asked-"Who's winning?" and "Who judges?" The answer: "You judge, I judge, everybody judges-and no one wins, because neither side agrees to lose!" (Barnabas Alonkua, personal communi- cation, circa 1972). The data I collected between 1971 and 1974 give clear evidence of historical inter- action among Igala, Igbo, and northern Edo over time, although it is not sufficient to demonstrate the nature of that interac- tion. Neither the history of the Otsa festi- val nor the history of Ekperi itself has been investigated satisfactorily to determine patterns of local migration and resettle- ment, including the incorporation of other ethnic groups into the one today that iden- winter 2003 - african arts 55</page><page sequence="17">tifies itself with the Edo part of its her- itage. The Otsa festival, with its link to age grades, key images, and terms that are cognate with Igbo and Igala examples, suggests some such interaction overlaid by a pattern of more straightforward bor- rowing in recent times. Until further re- search is carried out among the Igala, in Ibaji (the Igbo-Igala borderland), and among the northern Edo, we will be un- able to do more than suggest that the northern Edo of Ekperi have drawn heav- ily upon the cultures of neighboring Igbo and Igala to augment a heritage from the Benin kingdom. Postscript In 2002 and 2003 I was able to revisit northern Edo,43 where I observed parts of the Otsa festival in Azukhala-Ekperi, one of the communities where I had fol- lowed the festival closely in 1972. Despite a vibrant visual culture, the area has seen little active research since my own work of the early 1970s. In no way should the following comments be construed as the results of serious research, however, since my time and efforts were constrained by obligations elsewhere, fuel shortages, and local circumstances, notably the death of the wife of the senior official ("Father") of the festival. In 2002 Ekperi celebrated Big Otsa, that is, the festival associated with the formation of the boy's age group, when the most elaborate masking displays are held. The following year saw the cele- bration of "small" Otsa, and certainly the displays in Azukhala-Ekperi seemed truncated in relation to those I docu- mented thirty years ago during a Big r R' ~s-I~ul ? ; ?glS' II9 ,f:Ilr c "" Q "? i ;~i?: f: 4 i, t~ - B i.

Indeed, the stilt dancers put on one of the most exciting displays that I have witnessed (and it seemed as though more than four were performing, as they hurled themselves one after another across the playing ground and lurched into the crowd). Although fewer masquerades ap- peared in 2003 than in 1972, there is a natural ebb and flow to festival activities not captured by such "snapshots," even though separated by a considerable peri- od of time. First, there is the contrast between Big Otsa and the smaller festi- vals that occur in the intervening years. Whether particular masks are performed at all depends as well on costumes being in good repair, sufficient resources for refurbishing, and the availability of a dancer. In 2003 the bereavement of the Father of the festival and the subsequent abrupt change of date may have had a dampening effect. Nonetheless, the local council representative and attendants made an appearance, much as our own politicians do at Fourth of July parades; the event was written up in the local newspaper because I had a reporter in tow; and I was treated to photographs of masks that would have come out, if only there had been more time. Masquerade formats throughout north- ern Edo followed the same patterns I documented thirty years ago, although elements of royal Benin culture in pres- tige dress seemed more pronounced- giving rise to two different questions. One focuses on the shifting nature of identity. The other concerns the fate of the masquerades themselves. The mas- querades used in Ekperi today and in This page: 19.

However, this particular exam- ple represents a local style that predates the Ikot Ekpene style of carving that has become popular since the 1960s. It is said to have been carved in 1952 by Idaiwo Ulogho of Azukhala-Ekperi. Opposite page: Left: 20. Ufele, flute player. Ivionima Quarter, Azukhala-Ekperi, November 1972. Photo: Jean M.

Like the Agulese masquerade from Iviakpera Quarter (see Fig. 5), it features the cloth applique face of the Okakagbe ensemble masquerade known as Ancient Mother and a platform surmounted by a circle of figures. Here, however, the figures consist of plastic dolls from the marketplace rather than stuffed cloth ones. 56 african arts - winter 2003</page><page sequence="18">i; r?i r i i : k~ k L~7~;b-lI S ii the recent past are forms borrowed from the visual culture of non-Edo or other northern Edo peoples, possibly making them more celebratory than sacred. For this reason, they may seem less threaten- ing to people's identification with funda- mentalist Christianity or Islam, both of which are more prevalent today, even though Christianity has been an impor- tant feature of Ekperi's religious land- scape for many generations and Islam has been in the area since the late nineteenth century. The manhood ceremony that is central to the boys' age group is consid- ered "deep" Ekperi even if other aspects of Otsa may be imported.44 That Otsa's masquerades are linked to age group for- mation and its public celebration may be their saving grace. Membership in the age group remains of great social importance to all Ekperi citizens, religious affiliation notwithstanding. A transfer of emphasis to cultural identity, the impetus behind age group itself, makes the masquerades less likely to fall into disuse, giving them a greater chance to continue their lively evolution, with the next Big Otsa sched- uled to take place between August and November of 2005. 0 Notes, page 93 57</page><page sequence="19">BORGATT: Notes, from page 57 [This article was accepted for publication in August 2002.] Research in Nigeria was carried out from 1971 to 1974 under the auspices of the Nigerian Federal Department of Antiquities and partially funded by the following agen- winter 2003 - african arts 93</page><page sequence="20">cies: Museum of Cultural History, UCLA-Ralph Altman Fund; Regents of the University of California-Patent Fund; and NDEA Title VI grants awarded through the African Studies Center, UCLA. 1. See Boston 1960b for an account of Igala-Igbo relation- ships from the Igala viewpoint. 2. The only other context where I observed a masquerade performing in Ekperi was at the serving of a shrine in Okpenada. At that time, the Umese masquerade came out and the chief priest and his associates sang songs of ritual license. In other Ekperi communities, Umese comes out to make the New Year's festival (Ukpwe) (fieldnotes, Feb. 6, 1972). See Borgatti 1976b. 3. I gathered the field data used here in the context of a survey of material culture in Etsako local government area, Edo state, undertaken between 1971 and 1974; dur- ing this time I also carried out a more detailed study among the Okpella, another northern Edo group. In this article I have created a narrative linked to re- search and observations. My story, though undoubtedly containing inaccuracies and misinterpretations, is fasci- nating, and I hope that others, particularly those who have lived in Ekperi, will bring their individual under- standing of this festival to a public forum. With this pos- sibility in mind, I submit my efforts to be complemented by a complete catalogue of Ekperi masks and associated field data found on a Web site to be constructed after the publication of this article. 4.

I have docu- mented it among other northern Edo groups on the west bank of the Niger from the easternmost Etsako groups, Uwepa-Uwano and Ekperi, to the northernmost Etsako group, the Okpella (Borgatti 1976c, 1979b). 13.

Ulogobia mas- querade (Ivionima Quarter), "The Tallest of All," was made by Kadiri Akaya this year, 1972, because he felt that the other quarter, Iviakpera, was going to beat them at the presentation of masquerades (fieldnotes, Azukhala-Ekperi, January 10, 1973). 30. "Tiger" is the accepted pidgin translation for large feline animals, even though there are no tigers in sub- Saharan Africa. In Ogonochi-Ekperi on February 1, 1972, I was shown a costume dyed blue and orange along with a headdress for Ugwono. According to the group of elders consulted, the costume cost about ?8 to buy. The performer mimics the movement of a "tiger." 31. I documented comparable masks among neighboring Uwepa-Uwano, another northern Edo group. There, the Ugwono performer, possessed by the spirit, is said to be able to do anything, climb houses and wreak havoc in the community. Medicine is made for it prior to its coming out, and the mask may also be consulted as an oracle when not in play (Iviukhwe-Uwepa, October 9, 1972), In Edegbe- Uwepa, the Ugwono masquerade was described as show- ing strength and power (fieldnotes, March 23, 1972). 32. Ukbokolo means "fighter." When he comes out, every- one flees. Carved by Idaiwo Ulogho about twenty years ago, by the time of my 1972 research it had been under the charge of Charles Adolphus for four years (fieldnotes, Azukhala-Ekperi, February 9, 1972). This mask, like the Ekpenike from Azukhala-Ekperi, seems to be in the style of carving that predates the adoption of the Ikot Ekpene style. I photographed another version of Ukbokolo, in the style of Ikot Ekpene, in Ikpaikpa's compound in Osomeg- be-Ekperi. Carved by Audu of Udaba, it was said to wear a net-woven costume or body suit and to be about seven years old. It beats people (fieldnotes, Osomegbe-Ekperi, Ikpaikpa's compound, March 25,1972). I did not see either of these in performance in 1972. 33. Egu Akana, the mask, was purchased from East Cen- tral State circa 1969 to replace an "Idu" mask that had deteriorated (fieldnotes, Udaba-Ekperi, January 6, 1973). 34. This masquerade originated when the locusts came in 1929 or 1930. Barnabas Alonokua, my guide in Ekperi, last saw it in 1942. It accommodated many small young chil- dren (fieldnotes, Azukhala-Ekperi, November 23, 1972). It was invented by Idawo (fieldnotes, Azukhala-Ekperi, January 10, 1973). Slide reference 72.37.11. 35. Fieldnotes, Udaba-Ekperi, January 6, 1973; Azukhala- Ekperi, January 10, 1973. 36. See Cole &amp; Aniakor (1984:111-215) for an overview of Igbo masking with excellent illustrations. Pages 117-43 cover the most relevant area, north central Igboland. 37. I observed and photographed numerous masks in the style of Ikot Ekpene throughout Ekperi, although many were said to be carved locally-and I do not dispute this. I believe that local carvers had adopted this popular style. There was some disagreement over a masquerade referred to as "One Nigeria." Initially it was said to have been purchased at Aba around 1966 by the whole town at a cost of ?17 (fieldnotes, Ugbekpe-Ekperi, May 31, 1972). Later it was said that only certain unspecified things were purchased in Aba and added along with new clothes (fieldnotes, Ugbekpe-Ekperi, September 11, 1972.) I listed a masquerade referenced as Egu Asaba as an Ugbekpe-Ekperi masquerade (fieldnotes, May 31, 1972) and photographed another masquerade called Egu Asaba in Azukhala-Ekperi's Otsa festival in November 1972 (black-and-white 72.45.13). A masquerade called Egu Onitsha is referenced as appearing in Udaba-Ekperi during Otsa festival, November 15, 1972. 38. Song transcripts in fieldnotes (Ugbekpe-Ekperi, Au- gust 26, 1972). 39. Conversation with regard to the Egbemamu, or chil- dren's masquerades, revealed that medicine (ixhumi or ikhumi) is to prevent the children from being injured or disgraced while dancing. The medicine for Eguaosa and Agadogu, stilt dances that involve a high-wire perfor- mance, is against the wind blowing. Medicine is made for Afulele, a towering masquerade assembled of many items, to keep its head from toppling over (fieldnotes, Ugbekpe-Ekperi, September 11, 1972). 40. Fieldnotes, Azukhala-Ekperi, November 21, 1972. 41. For example, Azukhala-Ekperi's festival is based on the competition between Ivionima and Iviakpera Quar- ters, which divided about twenty-two years ago to make the festival celebration more competitive and to boost interest. Ivieakaizi, the third quarter, joins Iviakpera for the festival (fieldnotes, January 1, 1973; November 21, 1972). Similarly, Ugionokhwa and Apokha Quarters of Ugbekpe-Ekperi compete to make their festival more interesting (fieldnotes, August 26, 1972). I photographed forty-seven different named masquerades between the survey of material culture and the days of Otsa festival dancing that I observed in 1972 in Ugbekpe-Ekperi. More than thirty-three different masquerades were photo- graphed or discussed between the survey of material culture and the days of Otsa Festival dancing that I ob- served in 1972 in Azukhala-Ekperi. 42. This competitive spirit is articulated by support groups, which march through the playing grounds sing- ing or chanting. For example, men's and women's support groups recorded in Ugbekpe-Ekperi's Apokha Quarter chanted, "Mamule-we are the winners!" (tape 16:52-108). Other praise songs exhorted the audience to watch: "The words I want to say. Everyone should be present to watch. Don't come complain at the end that you haven't seen it..." (Ala je ni ye iyere (itseku) no ze ara me) (tape 16:110-34). 43.
