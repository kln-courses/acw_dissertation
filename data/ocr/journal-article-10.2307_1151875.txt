<plain_text><page sequence="1">REFLECTIONS ON THE ROSTOW DOCTRINE* Goran Ohlin Columbia University It is already clear that Professor Rostow's Stages of Economic Growth is no ordinary book. Originally a series of lectures given to Cambridge undergrad- uates, it was rocketed to international attention by the Economist, which pub- lished an extensive summary and called it "one of the most stimulating contribu- tions made to economic and political thought since the war. " In the course of one year it has orbited the globe in a variety of translations, to the accompaniment of public acclaim and donnish skepticism. It has enriched, or at any rate en- larged, the economic vocabulary of politicians, planners, and economists the world over. It has even been officially refuted in Pravda. It is obviously a tract for our time, already so widely known and discussed that it is much too late for a mere review, but not, perhaps, for some second thoughts on the Rostow mani- fe sto. What the enthusiastic reception of Rostow's book has brought into dramatic relief is the passionate demand for an intelligent man's guide to the problem of economic growth, which, after all, forms a principal item on political agendas everywhere. Scholars will be bemused by the claim to present "an alternative to Karl Marx's theory of modern history. " The fact is, however, that in all open societies, the social sciences, with their self-conscious scrutiny of society, pol- ity, and economy, are replacing both ideologies and utopias. The urbane mixture of insight and analysis, scholarly moderation and liberal criticism in the writ- ings of our more successful sociological and economic popularizers is providing the public debate both with ideas and with a language of sorts. The mysteries of growth and development, however, had not really been couched in a beguiling terminology and a simple but powerful analysis before Rostow ventured to pre- sent what he terms "an economic historian's way of envisaging the sweep of mod- ern history" to a broader audience. Taken very broadly, Rostow's perspective on history does of course have a few things in common with other economic historians' way of looking at it. When, nevertheless, they are likely to find his book a rather controversial and highly personal document, it is partly because the body of hard knowledge about growth is so small that any firm views must be regarded as working hypotheses which may not yet have been rejected but have not been very thoroughly tested, either. To say that the stages of growth add up to a theory of growth or, even worse, a theory of modern history, is therefore bound to provoke huffy rejoin- ders. But speak instead, as Rostow also does, of "an economic historian's way of looking at things"--and remember that he calls it "an arbitrary and limited way" which is "impressionistic rather than analytic"--and it is immediately easier to enjoy the dash and verve of the project, the daring and simplicity of the hypotheses. Even the most questionable notions may then appear as the en- gaging idees fixes of a lively and distinctive mind. * W. W. Rostow, The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto.

But economic historians incline to stages, which raises special problems. A wearisome arbitrariness and apriorism has marked much Stufentheorie, but no one will deny that all cases of economic growth have some common features, that the variations observed are variations on a single theme. Otherwise, it would be meaningless even to talk about economic growth as a gen- eral concept. Similarly, no one is likely to think of this process without some such distinctions as the one between pre-industrial and industrial phases. Even when it is only for reasons of intellectual convenience and ease in description, virtually any approach to the sweep of economic history will involve a sequence of stages, implicitly or explicitly, and however they are chosen they are bound to have some things in common. Some of the delicate questions this raises were searchingly discussed by Max Weber, whose warning of "the almost irresistible temptation to do violence to reality in order to prove the real validity of the con- struct" comes to mind more than once in the study of Rostow. The question is not only how one should choose one's stages, but how much deep significance one should attribute to their definition. The Rostovian sequence pretends to a theoretical backbone of sorts, but when it makes one squirm with unease at many points, it is above all because it brings into the open the tension between continuity and periodization in historical analysis. And Ros- tow does nothing to alleviate this tension--he accentuates by drawing boundary lines of specious precision. The theoretical justification for the introduction of discontinuities is drawn from the so-called leading sector analysis: In essence it is the fact that sectors tend to have a rapid growth-phase, early in their life, that makes it possible and useful to regard economic history as a sequence of stages rather than merely as a continuum, within which nature never makes a jump (page 14). Even in Rostow's own analysis it is only exceptionally, however, that new leading sectors of this sort are the chief back-stage phenomena. For which are the stages he proposes? First, that of the traditional society which serves chiefly as a base line. The second, somewhat awkwardly referred to as the pre- conditions stage, is one of cultural and institutional preparation for the crucial take-off stage, the great watershed, in which sustained growth becomes a nor- mal condition and is carried by a few rapidly expanding sectors--cotton manufac- ture in Britain, elsewhere mostly railroads, iron and steel, etc. Thereafter follows the "drive to maturity, " in the course of which modern technology is ex- tended to the whole range of economic activity. After maturity, we reach the "age of high mass consumption," marked, one gathers, chiefly by the spread of consumer durables which also become leading sectors. In this sequence, it is only the take-off and the last stage that are specifically linked to the semi- discontinuities of surging new sectors, and in general the analytical foundation of the stage sequence seems rather less compelling than Rostow makes it out. But this is a small matter. What counts is how useful and rewarding it is to view historical growth through Rostow's particular prism. It must first be said that the treatment of the traditional and transitional societies is remarkably successful in spite of its brevity. The vivid sketch of pre-industrial change in agriculture and transportation and of the precarious coalitions of "modernizers," often emerging under the pressure of nationalist reaction to foreign power, focuses attention on what is quite possibly the most intriguing as well as the most neglected phase of the whole growth problem. The take-off, however, is meant to be the central notion in the scheme. Its validity should also be the easiest to test. If the onset of sustained growth (alias "compound interest" in these pages) was really so sharp that periods of at most some thirty years stand out as decisive turning-points in the economic 649</page><page sequence="3">development of the older industrial countries, this should surely leap to one's eye. The statistics are poor, but such as they are they usually indicate a far more protracted acceleration of growth rates. The evidence of sudden jumps in investment ratios and capital formation is also rather inconclusive. On a priori grounds, it would be quite reasonable to assume that the acceleration of growth rates was sometimes slow and sometimes rapid, that the take-off model is more appropriate in some cases than in others, and perhaps that it is more likely to fit latecomers than old industrial nations. It would take a good deal more evi- dence either of sudden economic change or of the sudden break-through and tri- umph of modernizing generations to make one accept the suggestion that the die is always cast in two or three critical decades. In an aside which sounds like an echo of Max Weber's warning, Rostow mentions "the sense of considerable violence done to economic history" with which he tries to isolate such periods (page 40). But how much violence is it permissible to do to history in order to dramatize it ? In the recently settled countries, including the United States, the shading over between an expanding stable economy and the beginnings of industrialization is so smooth that one might wish to deny the need for anything even remotely like the take-off idea. Generally, however, the importance of the transition into industrialism would presumably be admitted even by those who prefer to think of it as a more fitful and lumbering affair than the smart and snappy take-off. After all, this is the old Industrial Revolution in a streamlined version. The fol- lowing stages are of an entirely different character. "The drive to maturity" and "the age of mass consumption" are obviously suitable chapter headings for economic histories of advanced countries. The chapters would have much in common, whatever the countries, and this shared experience would be much like that described in Rostow's sketches of these stages, with their industrial differentiation, "Buddenbrooks dynamics," urbani- zation, and suburbanization. There is much to admire in these vignettes: the concise suggestion of complex processes, the casual international comparisons, the sensitivity to mood and social style which enhances historical insight. What goes wrong is once again suggested by Max Weber, who commented on the perni- ciousness of Marxian concepts "as soon as they are thought of as empirically valid or as real (i.e., truly metaphysical) 'effective forces, ' 'tendencies, ' etc." Industrial "maturity" as here defined is not linked to the emergence of new sectors and cannot therefore be dated with precision. We are nevertheless offered "rough, symbolic dates" which, as it happens, all tend to fall some sixty years after the beginning of take-off. To one's disappointment this baffles even Rostow himself; it is one of the few things he does not explain. One might expect industrial differentiation to be a natural consequence of sustained growth, but in at least one case it is suggested that there was more to it. The end of the Swedish take-off, i. e., the beginning of the drive to matur- ity, is said to have been brought about by a "challenge, " viz., the "depression marked by a sagging away of Sweden's export markets" for timber in the 1890's. Thanks to a positive response to this challenge, Sweden shifted from timber into wood-pulp and began to export her Northern ores and differentiate her manufac- tures. The timing in this description is right: there was a second wave of indus- trialization after the Great Depression, marked by greater differentiation, im- port substitution, and the development of new export markets. But where is the challenge and the anthropomorphic response? The over-all export markets for European timber expanded at an undiminished pace up to the First World War: the Swedish share was falling as the result of forest depletion and Russian com- petition, but also because the growing pulp industry eventually absorbed even exportable timber. Forest depletion and conservation played their part, and so did the technological breakthrough in chemical pulp and the comparative cost situation which reflected the enormous expansion of world demand for paper and newsprint. It is not even remotely doing justice to this complex development 650 REVIEW</page><page sequence="4">ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE to suggest that a sagging export market jolted Swedish industry into new chan- nels. A central assumption in Rostow's broader discussion of the implications of growth is that a society that has attained maturity faces a choice between three objectives: How shall this mature industrial machine, with compound interest built into it, be used? To offer increased security, welfare, and perhaps lei- sure for the citizens as a whole ? To offer enlarged real incomes, includ- ing the manufactured gadgets of consumption, to those who can earn them? To assert the stature of the new mature society on the world scene ?. . . Maturity is a dangerous time as well as one which offers new, promising choices (page 72). The political problems that arise in the turmoil of industrialization might more or less allegorically be posed in this fashion. But to regard it as a choice in the allocation of resources seems historically unwarranted. The balance sheet of historical experience is far from clear, but if it could be shown that there was a clear inverse correlation between external aggressiveness and the rate of growth in living standards, this would be a pioneering study as well as a startling one. As for the welfare state, many would undoubtedly regard it as a consequence of a relatively high level of prosperity, rather than a substitute. What is meant by "high" consumption, anyway? The picture evoked by Rostow resembles that of classical capital theory: a hard and abstinent grind during the period of construction and gestation until the mature industrial machin- ery disgorges a flood of guns or consumers' goods. Of course, there is no such sudden stepping-up in our time series of per capita consumption, and Rostow does not cite any such series. In fact, his choice to ignore virtually the whole body of statistical information about growth that has been assembled in the last decades is one of the most curious aspects of his book. To be sure, he is en- titled to remind us that those crude aggregates do not reveal the dynamics at work, but where they do give a picture of continuity it cannot be spirited away. It appears that "high consumption" is not a statistical concept at all. It is defined as the consumption of durables: automobiles, refrigerators, washing machines, TV sets, and all the gadgetry of modern life. This obsession with appliances makes the gears clash in the shift from maturity to high consumption and leads to some strange problems. Why, it is seriously asked, did Britain, mature at the time of the Crystal Palace Exhibition, turn to high mass consump- tion only a hundred years later? The simple-minded suggestion that modern household gadgetry had not yet been invented is recognized (in a footnote) but not regarded as adequate. The complementary circumstance that incomes were on the low side is recognized as the proper explanation of the fact that improvement in the British standard of living did not produce any real gadgets before the bi- cycle--which, byitself, was not enough to signal a new era. Once laid, this ghostly question returns to haunt us in another context: why did the countries of Western Europe not in the 1920's proceed directly into the age of durable consumers' goods, as did the United States? They failed, we are told, "to move on to what is logically--in terms of the apparent income elasticities of demand of a free economy--the normal stage-of-growth beyond maturity. " This grievous failure, diffusely imputed to governments and people alike, is taken to explain the stagnation of the European economies in the 1920's. Can this be anything but nonsense ? There is no mention of relative incomes in Rostow's pages, but when West European per capita incomes in the 1920's were about half (or less) of the American, this would--in terms of the apparent income elasticities--seem to go far in explaining why Europeans might have found diffi- culty in following the wise lead set by American consumers. And considering that after the last war, when European incomes did reach the level the United 651</page><page sequence="5">States attained in the 1920's, the age of gadgetry finally dawned on Western Eur- ope, one can only wonder why Rostow must make simple things so complicated, when he can make complicated things so simple. There is, of course, a reason for the stress on gadgets and appliances. They give rise to new industrial classifications which show spectacular growth rates, and they link modern technology to consumption in a direct and tangible nexus of steel, electricity, and gasoline engines. By virtue of their spectacular expansion, these industries are appointed the leading sectors of the modern age. Now, if over-all consumption shows a fairly steady rate of increase, does it make very much difference whether the increment is dispersed over a great number of consumer goods industries or concentrated in a few? Presumably, only if the rate of output expansion constitutes such a strong stimulus to produc- tivity increases that the latter are more than proportional to industrial growth rates. This might be the case, although it cannot be decided merely on the basis of the correlation between expansion and productivity increase, since the oppo- site chain of causation is equally plausible. But however the tangled strands between the Engel dynamics and innovation are unravelled, it is hard to believe that the consumer durables industries systematically take over "leadership, " even though, thanks to their concentration, administered prices, instability of demand, etc., they obviously attract increasing attention. Have developments in these industries been responsible for the bulk of the productivity increases behind the continued growth of incomes ? The general impression is rather that most basic technological advances in recent years as in the past have occurred in producers' goods industries, and that they owe their pervasive impact pre- cisely to this fact. That electricity and the combustion engine have also made pos sible a plethora of new gadgets for consumers should not make us forget that their principal impact, after all, has been on industrial technology. It is possible and even probable that a climate of high social mobility, eager consumer acceptance of new products, consumer credit, etc., might at times make consumption a more active factor in the growth process than the passive Keynesian picture of consumption suggests. It is also a commonplace that the increasing preponderance of durables in consumption is destabilizing. But these considerations do not seem able to carry the whole weight of the argu- ment when we are told that in the age of high mass consumption, this very con- sumption becomes the pace setter, and that European stagnation in the 1920's was due to the failure to embark on high consumption, while the U. S. depression in the 1930's was conversely due to the fact that Americans had embarked on it. When the engine of growth based on the automobile, suburbia, and durable consumers' goods broke down, the United States threw its weight hard towards a post-maturity alternative, that is, to increased allocations for social welfare purposes. And the contours of the welfare state were rounded out under Franklin Roosevelt to remain an accepted part of the American scene, down to the present (page 79). What this opaque formulation is meant to convey is hard to say, for it can hardly be that high mass consumption would have fared better under Hoover. But when one learns that it was the Kaiser andhis counsellors who prevented Germany from immediately moving into high mass consumption, one begins to suspect that Rostow is rejecting not only statistics, but also the niggardly prin- ciple of scarcity of resources. Mass affluence seems to be a matter of will. In Russian society today, Rostow sees "an increased assertion of the will to enjoy higher levels of consumption, not some time in the future, but now"--and he speaks repeatedly as if economies that have graduated into "maturity"--whatever their actual level of output and income--have only themselves to blame if they do not immediately decide to be rich. But "compound interest" is not merely a metaphor; it is also an arithmetical concept, and although its powers are amaz- ing, economic growth remains, in the best of circumstances, a time-consuming affair. 652 REVIEW</page><page sequence="6">ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE That the age of affluence gradually shifts the focus of the economic prob- lem is apparent enough. But that it can be elected at will is true, at best, only in a very special sense, and that it so profoundly alters the character of society as to usher in a new era seems improbable. The Soviet Problem Yet it is this assumption that underlies much of the discussion of modern war, and particularly of the Soviet problem. If mass consumption is an option that nations choose as an alternative to power, does it not follow that the lures of modern conveniences dangled before the Russians would help to tame them? In spite of the modifiers and elegant qualifications in Rostow's presentation, this does seem to be the basic argument. Thus, Soviet suspicions of the West and her refusal to admit an effective control of armaments are said to be linked to Russia's critical position in the hierarchy of stages. Technically mature, Russia is ready and eager for the age of high mass-consumption, but the regime is holding it back, not from a genuine interest in Russian security, but from fear of the political consequences of high mass consumption. "How could Russia avoid the age of durable consumers' goods and services, if something like 20% of GNP--which now goes into the Soviet military budget--were released from military to civilian outlays? (see page 132)" Under the impact of prosperity, "Communism is likely to wither. . .and this, almost certainly, is well understood in Moscow. " This is not simply repeating the trivial but incontrovertible notion that Russian isolationism has aimed at minimizing economic discontent while resour- ces are channelled into heavy industry and military production. Instead, it is the vastly more speculative and dubious suggestion that Soviet levels of consump- tion are held back because this repression of living standards in itself serves a political purpose. And it also seems to imply that gradual improvements in the standard of living do not really count for much in the absence of modern gadgetry and durables; that at some point "quantity turns into quality, " in the Marxist tradition. What is the evidence that Russia is "seeking to convert its maturity into world primacy by postponing or dampening the advent of the age of high mass- consumption"? In terms of Nutter's analysis, which Rostow endorses, the lag between the American and the Soviet economy in per capita output is as much as 50 years. In view of that, and of the logic of income elasticities, the best of in- tentions could not have put Russia into the brave new world of mass consumption much earlier, and she is, after all, moving into it now. If her armaments ex- penditures were redirected into capital formation, it would accelerate Russian growth rates further (unless other bottlenecks are serious), but if instead con- sumers were given a boost, the effect would only be equivalent to a few years' normal increment from growth. And was not the insulation of the Soviet consum- ers and the Soviet economy even greater in the past, before the Russians had to worry about what to do with their maturity? There is nothing quite so strange about the Russian policies in these regards as to require a very complicated ex- planation, and the mystique of the stage theory only muddles things. In spite of these objections, Rostow's speculations on the nature of modern war are intriguing. That relative economic growth and modernization has been a fundamental element behind national aggression in the modern period cannot be disputed. And in their flush of success and power, their self-confidence and brashness,the statesmen who fell heir to what Rostow terms maturity may have a common denominator, whether we think of the Victorian imperialists (Rhodes, Milner, etc. ), of Teddy Roosevelt, the Kaiser, the Japanese militarists, or the Soviet leaders. Merely to name them, however, is to realize how fragile the claim is, how very difficult to establish. And if, say, the Kaiser's Germany was the victim of troubled maturity, can the same be said of Hitler's? 653</page><page sequence="7">That the moods and attitudes of successive generations of leaders will change in the course of industrialization along a fairly predictable course is nev- ertheless an appealing hypothesis. The recent changes in Soviet society fit in well, for it is certainly widely admitted that they have their roots not only in the political dynamics of Soviet society, but also in the emergence of a new genera- tion of technicians. This does not mean that these changes should necessarily be cause for optimism. The liberal ideas and democratic institutions of the West may have had the same roots as modern science and technology and the fabulous economic performance of the last centuries. But they were certainly not in any simple fashion the consequences of this development, which they often preceded. To believe that advancing industrialization and the global spread of the suburbs would by themselves bring liberal and pacific attitudes might be as Marxist an error as to believe that industrialism meant poverty and revolution. It is not an error that Rostow commits himself to, but it would be only too easy to read--or mis re ad- -him that way. It goes without saying that the policy proposed is unobjectionable: to be firm with the Russians without frightening them, and to demonstrate in the under- developed world the possibilities of meeting the tasks of growth within a demo- cratic framework. The case for those noble ambitions does not need the rickety scaffolding of the stage theory. The Anti-Marx The last chapter is devoted to those errors in the Marxist view of history from which the stage theory rescues us. Several points in this summary of the Marxist position are debatable, but it is enough to dwell on one. "The first and most fundamental difference between the two analyses, " we are told, "lies in the view taken of human motivation. " Marx is accused of the view that economic ad- vantage and interest are the sole or dominant motives of human action. The stages-of-growth theory, on the other hand, realizes the complexity of man: He seeks, not merely economic advantage, but also power, leisure, ad- venture, continuity of experience, and security; he is concerned with his family, the familiar values of his regional and national culture, and a bit of fun down at the local (page 149). It is startling to meet again this simple misconception, if only because it has been so often and so explicitly rebuffed, e.g., by Popper and Schumpeter. "The most important assertion in Marx's writings, " Rostow asserts, was that capitalism "left no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest." But the very indignation of that remark should be enough to make it clear that it was not a slander on human nature, but an attack on a social order that corrupted human relations. There might be a good case for rejecting Marx as a bore, as Keynes did, but if one wishes to discuss him seriously, it is not enough to make him out a simpleton. A more basic question is whether we really want an "alternative to Karl Marx's theory of modern history." To divine the laws of historical development, to predict the future, and to guide political action on this basis--these are the ambitions of what Popper termed historicism. There are good grounds for doubt- ing whether historical "theories" of this type are really compatible with free historical inquiry. Few Western historians would rally around any one interpre- tation of history, and the tinny sound of the stages-of-growth could certainly not be their clarion call. Yet there is obviously a deep ambivalence in the profes- sional attitude towards historical synthesis and generalization, which economic historians are likely to feel particularly strongly. The attempt to formulate a theory of economic growth can escape the problems of historicism only by limit- ing its perspective. Sir Lewis Namier once said that "the historical approach is intellectually humble, " but no "theory of history" can be presented in a spirit of 654 REVIEW</page><page sequence="8">ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE 655 intellectual humility. Rostow's occasional disclaimers that he is not talking about "rigid, inevitable stages of history" but only of "patterns of choice" merely serve to underline the tension between a historical theory and a way of looking at things. There is a strong ideological element, however, in this non-Communist manifesto, so strong that one occasionally suspects it of encroaching on the auth- or's historical sense. One can see him as an American Condorcet, penning in haste a "Sketch for a Historical Picture of Economic Progress. " Here are the steps of progress, optimistic faith--in the benefits of mass consumption; and Condorcet's inability to comprehend the setbacks of the Dark Ages except as a priestly conspiracy is matched by Rostow's failure to see Communism ("A Dis- ease of the Transition") as anything but the mere seizure of power for purposes of evil. Here, in the lively tradition of a discipline born in pamphleteering, is a proposal of a self-image and a policy for the West, commanding attention and disagreement.</page></plain_text>
