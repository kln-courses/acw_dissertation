APOLLO VISITS ... or, [he compares] Aeneas to Apollo, as Dido to Diana in the first book, even as a marriage cannot take place between siblings. Servius Danielis on Aeneid 4.I44 OVIDIAN AND VIRGILIAN TALES OF INCEST Incest is a major and explicit theme of the erotic content of Ovid's Metamorphoses, notably the brother-sister incest of Byblis and Caunus in Book 9, and the parent-child incest of Myrrha and Cinyras in Book io. The latter forms part of a longer sequence within the Song of Orpheus containing hints of incestuous desire. Myrrha is descended from the union of Pygmalion with the living woman into which his sculptural masterpiece is transformed: Pygmalion's desire for his own creation (Met. IO.249: 'operisque sui concepit amorem') has something of the narcissistic and incestuous about it (love for a figurative daughter, the work of art as the artist's 'child'). Myrrha in turn is the mother of Adonis, a baby as pretty as a picture of a naked Cupid - a similarity that infects Venus' desire for the grown Adonis with a strong whiff of the incestuous. Elsewhere Ovidian innuendo hints in passing at illicit desire. For example, at Met. 2.453-5 Diana retires to the cool grove where the result of her nymph Callisto's unchastity will be revealed; the goddess is heated from the hunt, 454 'cum dea uenatu et fraternis languida flammis', 'the goddess faint from hunting and the fire of her brother', language that to the impure mind could suggest an erotic heat and languor. The confusion between external heat and an erotic warmth is crucial to the stories of Narcissus (3.413-I5) and of Cephalus (7.809-I5). The reference in the previous line, 2.453 'orbe resurgebant lunaria cornua nono', to the ninth waxing of the moon, an indication of the passage of time since Jupiter's rape of Callisto, alerts us to the identification of Diana with the moon. All very Ovidian, and far removed from the serious business of Virgil's Aeneid, one might say. I shall suggest, however, that Ovidian innuendo implies a certain reading of the Aeneid, a reading that this article will attempt to justify through a range of inter textualities. But I start with Ovid, and with the claim that many of Ovid's stories of frustrated or perverted desire rewrite, in different ways, the Virgilian narrative of Dido and Aeneas.1 The first in the series of erotic stories in the Metamorphoses, and the one that within the text generates many of those that follow through what might be called Ovid's transformational grammar of myth, is the Apollo and Daphne story. This tale of a lustful god and a neurotically chaste virgin might seem as far removed as possible from the situation in which Dido and Aeneas find themselves. But there is a detail at the beginning of the Ovidian narrative that suggests both a half-submerged incest plot, and a Virgilian connection. Daphne, we are told, is (Met. I.476) 'innuptaeque aemula Phoebes', 'a rival of unwed Diana', imitating the goddess in her lifestyle and looks. This is not a very proper * Earlier versions of this article were delivered to audiences at the Universities of Lille, Thessaloniki, Michigan, and Nottingham, and the Oxford Philological Society; I am grateful to the audiences for their helpful comments, and also to Mary Depew, Stephen Harrison, and Phiroze Vasunia for reading and commenting on drafts. 1 See P.

Diana look-alikes come on stage at the begin ning of the Virgilian narrative, firstly in the person of the disguised Venus, mistaken by Aeneas for Diana or one of her nymphs, and secondly in the entrance of Dido herself compared to Diana in a famous simile (Aen. I.498-502). Further, Dido's erotic fall tragically undoes her vow to a perpetual state of chastity in memory of her dead husband Sychaeus.2 Ovid's Daphne prays to her father for perpetual virginity (Met. I.486-7), this too in imitation of Diana. In her second, and last, utterance praying for deliverance from her pursuer, she appeals to the Earth to swallow her, 544 'Tellus ... hisce',3 in a repetition of Dido's initial attempt to reinforce her resolve at Aen. 4.24 'sed mihi uel tellus optem prius ima dehiscat', 'I would pray that the earth would sooner open to its depths to swallow me'. Virgil explores figurative situations of both parent-child incest and sibling incest. Sibling incest is the focus of this article, but I briefly discuss the hints of parent-child incest, to which Ellen Oliensis has notably drawn attention.4 There are incestuous overtones in Aeneas' meeting with his disguised mother Venus in Book i, a scene modelled on, firstly, the erotic encounter, leading to sexual intercourse, between Aeneas' father Anchises and his mother Aphrodite in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite,5 and, secondly, the meeting between Odysseus and Nausicaa in Odyssey 6, that might have been the prelude to mar riage. Aeneas' first reaction to Dido herself is presented indirectly through the simile comparing the Carthaginian queen to Diana surrounded by her nymphs (Aen. I.498-502). To the concealed viewer, Aeneas, looking at the mortal woman corresponds, in the simile, Latona's joyful gaze on her daughter Diana, 502 'Latonae tacitum pertemptant gaudia mentem', 'joy silently assails Latona's mind': pertemptant is an unexpectedly strong word,6 as if a more dangerous emotion felt by Aeneas spills over into the simile to infect Latona's innocent maternal love. Dido's continuing attempts to control her relationship with Aeneas are also figured as eroticizations of a mother-child relationship. Speaking of Dido's 'oddly maternal passion', Oliensis notes the channelling of her desire for the father Aeneas through the person of Cupid disguised as the son Ascanius (I.712-22). Meanwhile Venus has sent the real Ascanius to sleep and whisked him away to her Idalian grove (I.69I-4). So far from being merely 'a comforting anaesthetic', as Austin puts it, Ascanius' slumber has an erotic, almost post-coital feel to it: the language is similar to that used of Venus' seduction of her lawful husband in Book 8.7 Later (43237-30) Dido wishes that she might be pregnant with a 'little Aeneas' who would remind her of his father, a consolation but also an erotic substitute for the departed Aeneas. 2 Sergio Casali, in his forthcoming commentary on Aeneid 4, suggests that the difficult phrase (Aen. 4.32) 'perpetua ... iuuenta' contains the idea of the more expected collocation perpetua uirginitate, found in the Ovidian Daphne's prayer to her father at Met. 1.486-7. 3 544-5 are often taken to be part of a double recension at this point in the text (on the issues see recently A. Barchiesi, Ovidio Metamorfosi, vol. I, Libri I-II (2005), 212-13). Daphne's alternative prayer is to her father, 546 '"fer, pater" inquit, "opem, si ilumina numen habetis"': Dido, after praying that the earth might swallow her, continues (25) 'uel pater omnipotens adigat me fulmine ad umbras'. If the Ovidian 'double recension' contains elements from, respectively, the two alternatives in Dido's oath, one might ask whether Daphne's 'si flumina numen habetis' makes a pointed contrast with the greater power of the fulmen. 4 E.

(n. 5), 25. amaracus 'marjoram' is the plant used by Hymen to bind his temples at Cat. 61.6-7, and is used by the exclusus amator to anoint the door-posts of the beloved at Lucr. 4.1177-9.</page><page sequence="3">VIRGIL S PTOLEMAIC RELATIONS 27 Thus Virgil uses the relationships between Latona and her daughter Diana, and Venus and her son Cupid, to reflect on the first stages of the relationship between Dido and Aeneas. But Dido and Aeneas also act out another Olympian relationship, that of the siblings, in some versions twins, Diana and Apollo.8 Dido's love may also be infandus 'unspeakable' (4.85) for the reason that, figuratively, it leads to sister-brother incest.9 A number of the salient aspects of this 'twinning' of Dido and Aeneas have been briefly discussed by Clifford Weber in an important article;10 it is the purpose of the present discussion to explore the detailed ramifications of this figurative incest. THE USES OF INCEST Before I look at the details, I want briefly to raise the question of why incest? What uses does the motif have for the writer beyond the salacious and titillating? Three kinds of answer may be suggested. Firstly, a psychoanalytical approach to the dynamics of plot, of a kind associated with the work of Peter Brooks, whose Freudian analysis of plot has been productively exploited by a number of critics of ancient narratives." Oliensis makes powerful use of this in her brief discussion of incest motifs in the Aeneid, identifying a regressive desire on Dido's part to conflate the future with the past, comparable to Andromache's futile attempt to create an exact replica of the lost Troy.12 Oliensis sees in the incestuous overtones of the meeting between Aeneas and his disguised mother 'a recursive movement in time and space'. 'In so far as incestuous unions come to figure narrative regress, the plot of the epic depends on the separation of maternal origins from marital ends; otherwise, Aeneas will reproduce only the past, not the future.'13 In the second half of the poem the exogamous union of Aeneas and Lavinia that will ensure that this story does have a future is endangered by what Kenneth Reckford, anticipated by Oliver Lyne, describes as the 'strange erotic triangle [of] Amata-Turnus-Lavinia ... where Amata's passionate concern for Turnus, her intended son-in-law, takes on incestuous colouring from Euripides' Hippolytus'. Secondly, the example of Pygmalion suggests incest as a model for the relationship between the artist or writer and his creation, figuring a forbidden desire for the artist's own 'child': forbidden both because the relationship is too close, but also because it is an impossible desire for an object that exists on the other side of the unbridgeable divide between the world of biological process and the unchanging world of mimetic representa tions. In the case of Ovid the closeness, verging on identity, of an incestuous relationship between siblings is analogous to the delusive identification of representation and reality. Note that Byblis and Caunus, the subjects of Ovid's major narrative of sibling incest, are not just brother and sister, but twins. Ovid's tales of incest are closely - incestuously, perhaps - related to an episode that has very frequently been read as a parable about the creation and reception of artistic productions, the story of Narcissus. We are here dealing not with the psychodynamics of plot, but with the psychology of creativity, or, to be more 8 In fact the idea that Apollo and Artemis are twins is rare outside Pindar: I. Rutherford, 'Pindar on the birth of Apollo', CQ 38 (1988), 65-75, at 72. 9 The etymologically synonymous nefandus is standardly used of incest (together with nefas, nefarius): P. Moreau, Incestus et prohibitae nuptiae. L'inceste ? Rome (2002), 43-5. 10 C. Weber, 'The Dionysus in Aeneas', CP 97 (2002), 322-43, at 338-40 (a first draft of the present article was completed before I read Weber's article).

J. T. Irwin's Freudian study of William Faulkner's novels offers much for the student of the narcissistic and incestuous mirrorings of Ovid, but perhaps less for the reader of Virgil.15 Thirdly, we can explore the meanings of incest within the culture and history of the Roman world. In literary-historical terms, incest is something of an obsession with the neoteric poets of the generation before Virgil; in the case of Catullus it is tempting to connect this obsession with the real-life personal and social circumstances of the poet.16 Charges of incest are a standard element of political and forensic invective in the Roman Republic.17 Rumours of incest will become a stock feature of hostile gossip about the imperial household. In the 30S B.C. political invective was directed against an alien royal household, the Ptolemaic dynasty of Alexandria, in which brother-sister marriage had become institutionalized as part of the practice and ideology of the ruling family, and it is this that will be the main focus of this article. Virgil's allusions to Ptolemaic brother-sister marriage can be read as a literary reflection of a historical reality, but it is also a major contributor to the dynamics of the plot of the Aeneid (the first of my 'uses of incest'): the threat of a quasi-incestuous union between Dido and Aeneas is one of the most serious obstacles to the successful working-through of the plot to its finis. CALLIMACHEAN RIVALRIES Dido and Aeneas are coupled as Diana and Apollo by the famous similes at Aeneid I.498-502 and 4.I43-50.18 These similes are based on Apollonian models (Argon. I.307-9, Jason like Apollo; 3.876-84, Medea like Artemis). Apollonius may suggest that Jason was meant for Medea, just as Apollo is Artemis' feminine double, but Virgil brings the hint of incest a step nearer by including both similes within the story of Dido and Aeneas, whereas the Apollonian comparison of Jason to Apollo occurs right at the beginning of the Argonautica, two books before Jason and Medea are brought together. Callimachean allusion in the description of the party setting out for the hunt draws Dido and Aeneas yet closer. Immediately before the picture of Aeneas as Apollo, Dido is presented in the threefold golden magnificence of her quiver, hair-clasp, and brooch, 4.I38-9 'cui pharetra ex auro, crines nodantur in aurum, I aurea purpuream subnectit 15 J.

Clausen, Virgil's Aeneid and the Tradition of Hellenistic Poetry (1987), ch. 2 'Two similes and a wedding'; 23 'Dido and Aeneas are thus beautifully paired'. Aeneas pulcherrimus (4.141) mirrors Dido's first appearance at 1.496, forma pulcherrima Dido. The Apollo simile occurs in a context of allusion to weddings: Austin notes on 141 pulcherrimus 'Aeneas is worthy of her, just as Manlius was worthy of his young bride's beauty' at Cat. 61.189-92 'at, marite ... nihilo minus | pulcer es, ?eque te Venus | neglegit'. The setting out to the hunt is an ill omened deductio: Austin on 4.133 'reginam thalamo cunctantem ad limina' compares Cat. 61.79 'tardet ingenuus pudor'. With 4.150 '[Aeneas] egregio decus enitet ore' cf. Cat. 61.186 'ore floridulo nitens' (of the bride, but in the next stanza we are told that the groom is as beautiful). The model of Cat. 61 continues in Dido's futile wish at Aen. 4.328?9 'si quis mihi paruulus aula | luderet Aeneas, qui te tarnen ore referret': cf. Cat. 61.209, 214-15 'Torquatus ... paruulus ... sit suo similis patri | Manlio'.</page><page sequence="5">VIRGIL S PTOLEMAIC RELATIONS 29 fibula uestem', 'her quiver was of gold.

Virgil intensifies the literary 'twinning' that already relates the two Callimachean hymns by making the Apollonian passage the primary model for golden Dido, who shares quiver and clasp with Apollo. The woman compared to Diana on her first appearance now appro priates the attributes of Apollo, as the Callimachean Hymn to Artemis encroaches on the territory of the Hymn to Apollo.20 It is, then, as two images of Apollo that Dido and Aeneas set out on the journey towards the cave. This allusive merging into one of the two individuals can be compared with another kind of linguistic double-take that happens in that enclosed space: 4.i65-6 (reproducing Iz4-5), 'speluncam Dido dux et Troianus eandem I deueniunt [125 -ient]', 'Dido and the Trojan leader take refuge in the same cave', where dux is naturally taken of Dido at first (cf. I.364 'dux femina facti'), and two words later reassigned to Aeneas. The Callimachean - and now Virgilian - rivalry between the hymns to Apollo and Artemis will be reused by Ovid to frame his Apollo and Daphne story. We are told that before Cupid engineers the episode with his two arrow-shots, Daphne had prayed to her father for eternal virginity in literary emulation of the Callimachean Artemis' prayer to her father, Zeus, at the beginning of the Hymn to Artemis.2' At the very end of the narrative we read that the newly-created laurel tree seemed to nod in answer to Apollo's address, replicating the shaking of the laurel that is the sign of the epiphany of Apollo in the first line of the Callimachean Hymn to Apollo.22 Apollo's conquest of Diana-look-alike Daphne is measured by the replacement of one Callimachean hymn by another. SUN AND MOON Diana is the moon, Apollo is the sun. Aeneas' first vision of Dido is in the likeness of Diana, his last is of her ghost compared in another simile to the barely visible new moon (Aen. 6.453-4).23 Other glimpses of the moon are visible at the beginning of the story: the Diana-like Dido who first appears to Aeneas in Book i is a near-relative of the Diana-like Venus, whose meeting with her son is modelled on the goddess's appearance to Anchises 19 See J.

The Amazons of Dido's double, Penthesilea, in the scene in the temple of Juno are armed with (Aen. I.490) 'crescent, moon-shaped, shields' 'lunatis peltis' (the first appearance of lunatus in Latin). Dido, for her part, first sees Aeneas when the cloud in which Venus had wrapt her son is dispersed and he shines forth, I.587-9 'scindit se nubes et in aethera purgat apertum. I restitit Aeneas claraque in luce refulsit I os umerosque deo similis', 'the cloud parted and evaporated into clear air. Aeneas stood there and shone forth in the bright light, his face and shoulders like a god' - like the sun breaking through clouds. The solar image is not explicit here, it is true, but parallels in Virgil and Ovid support this obvious way of taking it.24 Aeneas will re-emerge from the Underworld into a brilliant future, and his ultimate avatar will be Augustus, whom we view at the end of the Shield of Aeneas, 'ipse sedens niueo candentis limine Phoebi', 'seated on the snow-white threshold of gleaming Apollo' (8.720), a roi-soleil under the protection of the sun-god Apollo.25 Many readers detect allusion to Dido and Aeneas in the first line of the Song of Jopas at I.742, 'hic canit errantem lunam solisque labores', 'he sings of the wandering moon and the labours of the sun'. errantem hints at the erotic errores of Dido,26 labores at the Herculean 'labours' of Aeneas.27 Wilhelm Roscher assembles passages that attest to the idea of the love of the moon for the sun in Greco-Roman antiquity.28 Interesting in con nection with the scene in the Underworld where Dido appears to Aeneas in the likeness of the moon, barely discernible, 'primo ... mense' (6.453),29 are passages suggesting that the new moon is the time for the conjunction, ciuvo6o;, coitus, of sun and moon.30 Erotic overtones are present in Plut., Is. 37zD (Isis as moon, dressed in black clothes) Toig 6K gXaVuTToo6XOtq ?oalivuyOal Tag KpU'jJItq KaU TOURg 7C~p1GKl?10Uq EV O01 61(0K81 7tooCova TOv 'iXIov 'in [the statues of Isis] with dark garments are shown the concealments and the obscurations in which she in her yearning pursues the Sun'.

The simile is modelled on Apoll. Rhod., Argon. 4.1479-80, where Herakles glimpsed in the distance is compared to the moon seen v?p ?vi igauc 'at the beginning of the day';34 but a reunion at the time of the new moon, primo mense, may remind us of another story, the return of Odysseus to claim Penelope TOV gTv 4OivovTog grjvq5, ToO 6' inTagPvoio 'when one month, or moon, is waning and the next is taking its place' (Od.

Norman Austin, cautiously reviving a nineteenth-century solar mythology, argues that this temporal specification is part of a wider pattern of solar and lunar imagery in the Odyssey that sets up an analogy between the rhythms of the heavenly bodies and of human relationships, in which the hero comes almost to embody the sun: 'Thus [Odysseus] enters into a courtship, which he had performed many years before, in phase now with the courtship of sun and moon.'35 But if Aeneas did have a momentary fantasy of making amends by an otherworldly hieros gamos with Dido, and if allusion to seasonal patterns in the Odyssey hints, at least to the reader, at a convergence of this last meeting between Dido and Aeneas with the reunion of Penelope and Odysseus as man and wife,36 the reality is that Dido has now returned once and for all to her former husband, Sychaeus. PTOLEMAIC MODELS What would it mean to think of Aeneas and Dido as incestuous brother and sister, Apollo and Diana, sun and moon? At the level of narrative, as has often been pointed out, they are closely twinned in their private and public lives - both have suffered the loss of a spouse in violent circumstances, both have been forced into exile as rulers of their peoples, with a mission to found a new city. Aeneas will recognize elements of his own story in the disguised Venus' narration of the tale of Dido in Book i. Dido's infatuation will be reinforced by her self-recognition in Aeneas' narrative of his own sufferings.37 At the level of historical allusion, the Roman reader might detect in the 'marriage' of a royal pair allusively marked as brother and sister a deviation on the part of the ancestor of the Julian gens into the practice of the Egyptian enemy, the brother-sister marriages of the 32 He had complained about another fleeing woman at the beginning of the whole story, when Venus had revealed her true self to him at Aen. 1.406 'tali fugientem est uoce secutus', where fugientem ... secutus hints at the erotic topos of the pursuit of the fleeing object of desire, here the goddess of love herself. 33 W.

One further Homeric model may lurk behind the dance between Aeneas-sun and Dido-moon, in Metrodorus' astronomical allegorization of Homer, whereby Achilles is the sun and Hector the moon: W. Nestle, 'Metrodors Mythendeutung', Philol. 66 (1907), 503-10, at 505-6 suggests that the allegorization may have been prompted by similes in the Iliad, in particular 19.397-8 (Achilles as the sun-god Hyperion) and 8.555-9 (tne camp fires of the Trojans and their leader Hector like stars round the moon); and by the thought that Hector grows pale and shrinks before the glare of Achilles ? and is famously pursued by Achilles. 37 On the 'twinning' of the couple see Weber, op. cit. (n. 10), 338-9. We might also think of a Homeric model: Virgil's Carthage corresponds structurally and in other ways to the Odyssean Phaeacia, whose rulers King Alcinous and Arete are apparently siblings (as they indubitably are at Hesiod fr. 222 M-W).</page><page sequence="8">32 PHILIP HARDIE Ptolemies, most recently (and finally) of Cleopatra VII with Ptolemy XIII and XIV.38 Cleopatra herself was probably the daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes and his (full) sister Cleopatra VI. The coming together of sun and moon also loses its Homeric innocence when placed in an Egyptian context. In Greek Aigyptiaka Osiris is the sun, and Isis the moon (Diod. Sic. I.II.I).39 Ptolemaic kings identified themselves with Osiris, and their queens with Isis, and most recently these roles had been acted out by Antony (as Dionysus Osiris) and Cleopatra.

The recent intensification of interest in the use of Hellenistic poetry in the Aeneid serves to redirect our view of the Egyptian queen, not just the demonized consort of a Roman general, but also the last in the line of a royal house at whose court flourished artists and writers who had decisively influenced Roman culture, and would continue to do so even after the Roman military conquest of Egypt. Alexandria capta ..... So far I have focused in particular on Virgil's allusion to the Hymns of Callimachus, poems from third-century B.C. Alexandria that talk about gods rather than humans. Recent work has increasingly explored the possibility that Callimachus reflects aspects of the image and ideology of the Ptolemaic ruler, both male and female, in the praises and narratives contained in the Hymns. Callimachus' Artemis has been seen as the image of a good Ptolemaic queen.42 The Callimachean framing of a hymn to Artemis by two hymns in honour of her brother Apollo has been read in the light of Ptolemaic brother-sister relationships.43 Such equivalences would not be out of keeping with the more overt paral lelisms between Ptolemaic kings and queens and a variety of gods in other Alexandrian texts and works of art, and extending to identification in cult.44 It might even be suggested that Virgil comments on this kind of parallelism between god and ruler in Alexandrian texts and cult through the recurrent tendency in the Dido and Aeneas story for the god to wear the mask of the human, and vice versa: Venus disguised as a Carthaginian maiden, mistaken by Aeneas for another goddess Diana, and as a Diana-Venus composite almost 38 On brother-sister marriage in Egyptian myth and reality see J.

And if, as seems not impossible, there was a final flowering of Alexandrian court poetry, does Virgil, in using that tradition himself, aggressively divert it to the ends of Octavian? 42 M.

The antics of Antony and Cleopatra in identifying themselves with gods Egyptian and Greek are the last manifestation of a venerable Ptolemaic tradition. Might it even be the case that the pronounced theatricality of the Dido and Aeneas story, a drama that unfolds in a new city whose most eye-catching monuments are its theatres (Aen. I.427-9), points to what is perceived as a specifically Alexandrian proclivity for theatrical display and maskings?47 I turn now to look at Virgil's use of Callimachean texts that speak directly about the Ptolemaic rulers. As the Trojans sail away from Carthage at the beginning of Aeneid 5 they look back to see flames lighting up the walls and do not know the cause, although they have dark forebodings. In Callimachus' Ektheosis of Arsinoe, Philotera, the already deified sister of Arsinoe II, wife and sister of Ptolemy Philadelphus, sees, in mid-flight, smoke billowing up through the air, 'the indicator of the funeral pyre', cac wvtptav &amp; 6R irvp&amp; OV6' 4zov (fr. 228.40).48 For Philotera, however, the cause is obscure, and she asks Charis, the wife of Hephaestus, to see what is going on. She is fearful that a city in Libya may be ablaze (49). Di Benedetto points to the allusion to the scene in Iliad zz in which Andromache has not yet received news of the death of Hector, when she hears the sound of lamentation coming from the tower (42.437 oii 2 T6 iEcVco; cf. Callim. fr. 228.45 ?co 6' iv anuaToq).49 The Ektheosis of Arsinoe also tells of a death that will bring much grief to a spouse, but now grief will be consoled by deification. In the Aeneid the flames of Dido's funeral pyre that light up the walls will in the fullness of time light the fires that destroy the city of Carthage, as foreshadowed in the simile at Aen. 4.669-7I, imitating the simile at Iliad 22.4I0-II that compares the lamentation at the death of Hector to the effects of the burning of the city of Troy. Virgil reinstates the 'tragic' Iliadic narrative that Callimachus replaced with a story that has a happy ending, of a kind. Virgil also turns to his own ends another Iliadic reference in the Callimachean poem. The Callimachean line, fr. zz8.40 cvactpvcTptav a 6? icup&amp;q tv0ica' ioav, in which Philotera notices the flames, alludes to the Iliadic line, i6.Iz7 ?V6cy 61 iap Vrpli 2Tupoq 6lltoto icofv (where ibo) 'shout, cry' is unusually used of fire), in which Achilles tells Patroclus that he sees fire coming from the Achaean ships. At the beginning of Aeneid 5 the Trojans have escaped with their ships intact (i-z 'interea medium Aeneas iam classe tenebat I certus iter'). But Mercury had warned Aeneas that unless he hurried on his way, 4.566-7 'iam mare turbari trabibus saeuasque uidebis I conlucere faces, iam feruere litora flammis', 'you will soon see her ships churning the sea and deadly torches blazing and the ' 50 shore seething with flames' 45 Depew, op. cit. (n. 42), argues that Callimachus' hymns to Artemis and Athene construct images of the Ptolemaic queen as virginal and athletic, but in full, and allusively insistent, awareness that elsewhere Ptolemaic queens are identified with Aphrodite. 46 Richly documented by Weber, op. cit. (n. 10). 47 For the importance, often overlooked, of the theatre in Hellenistic, and specifically Alexandrian, culture see A. Cameron, Callimachus and his Critics (1995), 39-42.; M. Fantuzzi and R. Hunter, Tradition and Innovation in Hellenistic Poetry (2004), ch. 9. Theatrical imagery is prominent in Plutarch's Life of Antony: see Pelling, op. cit. (n. 40), index s.w. 'imagery, of theatre'; Pelling notes, ? propos of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, that (39) 'Ant. ... transposed for the theatre more readily than any other life'. Do Virgil and Plutarch draw on a shared tradition of portraying Ptolemaic Alexandria as a theatrical, stagey, city? 48 The allusion to Callim. fr. 228 is discussed by P. A. Johnston, 'Dido, Berenice, and Arsinoe: Aeneid 6.460', AJP 108 (1987), 649-54, at 653-4: 'Like Arsinoe, Dido and her city are one. Like Cleopatra, the descendant of Berenice, Dido is destroyed because of her Roman lover. Like Berenice, finally, Dido has at last been reunited with her husband.' 49 V. di Benedetto, 'Callimaco di fronte al modello omerico: il fr. 228 Pf.', RFIC 122 (1994), 273-8. 50 At Aen. 1.525 Ilioneus had asked Dido 'prohibe infandos a nauibus ignis'; with 4.567 'conlucere ... flammis' cf. 5.4 'conlucent flammis': the implication is perhaps that had Aeneas tarried the flames would have been those of his ships rather than of Dido's pyre.</page><page sequence="10">34 PHILIP HARDIE The death of Arsinoe II is a tragedy, but also, as the key moment in Ptolemy II's elabora tion of the cult of royal brother-sister couples, foundational for the Alexandrian dynasty. So far from being redeemed by a husband's grief, Dido's death marks her final separation from one who she had hoped would be her husband, and it will lead eventually to the destruction of all Carthaginian institutions. In this story it will be no African Queen, but the Trojan ships which undergo apotheosis.51 ALEXANDRIAN AND ROMAN ASTRONOMIES Callimachean allusion bridges the division between Books 4 and 5. Another tale of celestial elevation, the Lock of Berenice, is rewritten in funereal mode as Iris releases Dido from her death agony by cutting off a lock of her hair (4.693-705). It is now standard to make a connection between this passage and the notorious allusion to the Catullan Coma Berenices at Aen. 6.460 'inuitus, regina, tuo de litore cessi', 'unwillingly, queen, I left your shore'.52 To the great heap that has been written on that line I add a few grains more. Ptolemy III Euergetes and Berenice II were cousins, but 'brother and sister' in the official ideology, a relationship which is made the subject of a disarming joke in the Coma Berenices, Cat. 66.zi-z, 'et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile, I sed fratris carn flebile discidium?' 'Yet, when deserted, you did not grieve the widowed couch, did you, but the tearful separation from a dear brother?' Within the structure of the Callimachean fiction there is a functional equivalence, based on the logic of sacrificial substitution, between the husband who leaves his wife (and returns), and the lock of hair separated from its mistress (not to return). If Aeneas as a human individual mouths the words of a part of Berenice's own body, this is to place him in the role of Ptolemy. The Coma tells of a new constellation in the heavens that is the product of an intensely erotic relationship; these astronomical erotics are anticipated in the opening account of the expertise of the court-astronomer Conon who, among other things, knows (Cat. 66.5-6 'ut Triuiam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans I dulcis amor gyro deuocet aereo') 'how sweet love steals the Moon away beneath the rocks of Latmos, calling her down from her airy orbit': the love of the moon.53 Callimachus presumably has in mind a rationalization of the myth of Endymion as the eclipse of the moon or the new moon.54 The combination in the praise of Conon of a list of astronomical questions with an eroticized sky that anticipates a human narrative finds a parallel in the Song of lopas at Aeneid I.740-6. lopas is the pupil of Atlas, who was 51 Wills, op. cit. (n. 19), 303-5 argues that the Virgilian ship-nymphs are another transform of the Callimachean Lock of Berenice (cutting, metamorphosis, safe return home). 52 See R.

Gutzwiller, 'Callimachus' Lock of Berenice: fantasy, romance and propaganda', AJP 113 (1992), 359-85, at 377-8. The collocation dulc?s amor occurs in the Aeneid only at 6.455, when Aeneas addresses the shade of Dido, 'dulcique adfatus amore est'; also at Geo. 3.291-2 'sed me Parnasi deserta per ardua dulcis | raptat amor', dulc?s amor in Catullus: 64.120; 66.6; 68.24, 96; 78.3. 54 cf.

In narrating the death and catas terism of Julius Caesar in Metamorphoses I5, Ovid alludes to the Callimachean Lock of Berenice: readers may differ as to whether the effect is to dissipate Augustan ideology in a Callimachean froth, or to divert to safely Augustan ends the exuberant claims of the Ptolemaic court.58 But the conversion of the Lock of Berenice into the sidus Iulium is not an Ovidian innovation. Jeff Wills points to the parallels between the opening of Catullus 66 and the sudden appearance to the stargazing Daphnis of the Caesaris astrum at Eclogue 9.46-8.59 At the beginning of the Georgics the poet foresees the possibility of a catasterism of Octavian himself, a nouum sidus that likewise alludes to the Coma Berenices.60 When in Aeneid i Jupiter reassures Venus that she will carry Aeneas 'sublimem ... ad sidera caeli' (i.z59-60), this will be a repetition of what she had previously done for the Lock of Berenice (Cat. 66.63-4).61 When later in Aeneid i Aeneas first appears to Dido, the mist that has hitherto concealed him is suddenly dispersed as if to reveal a celestial body (I.586-93). Above it was suggested that the image is of the sun breaking through clouds, so that Dido first sees Aeneas as like the sun, as Aeneas' first vision of Dido had been in the likeness of Diana, the goddess of the moon. A solar likeness anticipates the doomed love of sun and moon, Apollo and Diana. Mary Frances Williams and Stephen Harrison have argued for an alternative astronomical identification, seeing here yet another allusion to the sidus Julium. In particular the words (590) 'caesariem nato genetrix' foreshadow Venus Genetrix' service in transforming her more distant descendant, Julius Caesar, into a god. caesariem puns both on the name Caesar and on the 'hairy star', KOg "jT1l, that marked his apotheosis.62 If it is true that both sun and sidus Iulium appear before Dido's eyes, the combination encapsulates the story that is to unfold: conjunction of sun and moon in an anticipation of Ptolemaic brother-sister marriage, whose most sparkling literary celebra tion is Callimachus' Coma Berenices, to be followed by a tragic separation that is yet the necessary precondition for the ultimate success of the gens Iulia, given the seal of divine recognition by the sidus Iulium, a star that the poets will write as a Roman appropriation of the Coma Berenices.

Rhod. 4.57-8, where in her exultation over Medea's flight to Jason the Moon comforts herself that she is not alone in straying to the Latmian cave. J. M. Bremer, 'Full moon and marriage in Apollonius' Argonautica', CQ 37 (1987), 423-6 argues that the appearance of the (full, this time) moon in the simile at Argon. 4.167-70 alludes to marriage. 56 On Virgil's use of the description of Conon at the beginning of the Coma at Eel. 3.40, 9.46-8 see J.

Sun and moon enter a particular conjunction in an Egyptian context. The twin offspring of Cleopatra and Mark Antony, born in 40 B.C., were formally recognized by Antony in 37/6 B.C. and given the names of AkX"avbpog "HXtoq and KkcoiraTpca YXfiVi (Plut., Ant. 36.5). Eduard Norden suggested that these grandiose names are to be seen in the context of the prophecies of a new age (Aion) to be ruled over by the Sun, and which would be marked by the birth of a child destined to rule the world, the context, Norden argued, of another product of 40 B.C., the Fourth Eclogue.65 'Sun' and 'Moon' were children of a couple who represented themselves as the earthly instantiation of the union of the divine siblings Isis and Osiris (see above).66 In 34 B.C. Alexander Helios was betrothed to the daughter of the Median king (Dio 49.44); Cleopatra Selene later married Juba II of Mauretania.67 But was there a point at which the children might have been intended as a Ptolemaic man and wife for each other, to rule over a Ptolemaic empire expanded to include Rome itself? Or could such a pos sibility have been put about by the propagandists of Octavian?68 Reality turned out to be very different: according to Dio, on the third day of the triple triumph in Z9 B.C. (the celebration of the Egyptian victory) Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene were led in the procession accompanying an effigy of their mother Cleopatra reclining on a couch; or, in the laconic words of Eusebius' Chronicle (II p. i90 Schoene) 'Triumphum uictoriae con stituit Augustus, in Cleopatrae triumpho Sol et Luna eius liberi apparuere', 'Augustus decreed a triumph for his victory; in the triumph over Cleopatra her children Sun and Moon were displayed'.69 We may imagine them in the procession of defeated peoples in the 63 Williams, op. cit. (n. 62), 12 suggests that the simile at Aen. 8.589-91 comparing Pallas to the Morning Star (Venus) alludes both to the Lock of Berenice, raised heavenwards to the lap of Venus, and to the sidus lulium: if so another merging of Ptolemaic and Roman astronomies. 64 A.

Joseph Reed has explored the theological and ideological ramifications of a seemingly incidental death on the battlefield at Aeneid I2.458, where a Trojan named Thymbraeus strikes down an Italian named Osiris: Thymbraeus' name evokes both Trojan (Thymbra) and Roman (Thybris) topography, encapsulating the passage from one to the other,71 and also hints at the god Apollo, who had a shrine at Trojan Thymbra.72 A strenuous decoupling of Egyptian and Roman identities, whose confusion had been threatened by the enactment by Aeneas and Dido of a brother-sister coupling of Apollo and Diana, may also be read in the final scene on Olympus in the Aeneid, the 'reconcil iation' of Jupiter and Juno. In his subtle article on Virgil's 'divided allusion' to the Coma Berenices in the Aeneid, Jeff Wills points out that only a part of Cat. 66.39-4I is replicated in the infamous inuitus, regina line at Aen. 6.460: inuita, o, regina, tuo de uertice cessi, inuita: adiuro teque tuumque caput, digna ferat quod si quis inaniter adiurarit. Unwilling, 0 queen, I left your head, unwilling; I swear by you and by your head; whoever swears lightly, may he receive a suitable punishment. Other elements are found in the final interview between Jupiter and Juno at Aen. Iz.807-I8: 809 'Turnum et terras inuita reliqui', 'unwillingly I left Turnus and the earth'; 8ii 'digna indigna pati', 'to suffer things worthy and unworthy'; 8i6 'adiuro Stygii caput implacabile fontis', 'I swear by the implacable head of the Stygian fountain'. Wills concludes '... inuita Juno in Book iz is the missing partner of inuitus Aeneas in Book 6'.73 To Wills' comments on the meaning of this partnering of passages something else may be added. This is the point in the poem when two other partners are restored to a harmonious relationship, Jupiter and Juno, husband and wife, but also brother and sister, as Juno pointedly reminds herself and the reader at her first appearance, I.46-7 'ast ego, quae diuum incedo regina Iouisque I et soror et coniunx', 'but I, who go forth as the queen of the gods, and sister and wife of Jupiter'. In the final interview in Book i2 between the Olympian couple, Jupiter addresses Juno as coniunx at the beginning of his first speech to her (793), and jokingly appeals to their sibling solidarity at the beginning of his second, 830-I 'es germana Iouis Saturnique altera proles, I irarum tantos uoluis sub pectore fluctus', 'you are the true sister of Jupiter and the second child of Saturn, such waves of 70 K. L. Zachos, 'The tropaeum of the sea-battle of Actium at Nikopolis: interim report', JRA 16 (2003), 65-92, at 90-2 suggests that the two children seen riding with Octavian in his triumphal chariot on the relief representing the triumph from the victory monument at Nicopolis may be Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene; he gets over the disagreement with Dio (the children accompanying the effigy of Cleopatra) by suggesting that the relief may represent the Actian triumph on the second day. Others are sceptical. 71 Compare Francis Cairns' analysis of the geographical symbolism of the mountain similes at 12.701-3, mapping an east-west progression from Athos to Eryx to Appenninus, Virgil's Augustan Epic (1989), 109. 72 J.

Relationships between the divine couple have been put under heavy strain by a disagreement about the course of human history, which has almost led to a wedding between a proto-Roman and a Carthaginian which, figuratively, could have functioned as an aition for the brother-sister marriages of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Alexandria, whose last ruler was demonized as another threat to the existence of Rome. Once again a Homeric motif takes on a new meaning if passed through the filter of Alexandria. The Iliadic brother-sister marriage of Zeus and Hera (Iliad i6.432 Kac7VT1ryn'V aaXoX0v Te) is presented in Theocritus 17 as a positive model for Arsinoe's love for her 'brother and husband', I34 ?K OugoV cT~pyol~c KWYVTOV m 1t6cV Ta.

In Callimachus' Acontius and Cydippe story the narrator cuts himself off to avoid mentioning the secret marriage of Zeus and Hera (fr. 75.4-5), "Hpfv y7p KAOTE faL - KOOV, KUOV, '1 tuO, koi6p?

Until we come to the plural verb pararunt we might be misled into thinking that Augustus had defeated the Egyptians only to adopt Egyptian ways: after the reference to Egyptian ships, soror coniunxque momentarily hints at one who is botb sister and wife, before we 74 See R.

Pretagostini, Ricerche sulla poes?a alessandrina (1984), 144-6 (a reference I owe to Marco Fantuzzi). Hazzard, op. cit. (n. 38), 85-90 argues that the incestuous marriage of Ptolemy Philadelphus and Arsinoe II was prompted by the desire to follow the example of Zeus and Hera, rather than to conform to native Pharaonic custom. In the monument dedicated by Callicrates to Ptolemy Philadelphus and Arsinoe at Olympia statues of the royal couple were set atop columns positioned at equal angles to the corner columns of the temples of Zeus and Hera: P.

Byblis tries for a moment to justify her passion for her brother, before pulling herself up, Met. 9.497-50I 'di melius! - di nempe suas habuere sorores; I sic Saturnus Opem iunctam sibi sanguine duxit, I Oceanus Tethyn, lunonem rector Olympi. j sunt superis sua iura; quid ad caelestia ritus I exigere humanos diuersaque foedera tempto?', 'The gods forbid! - yet, to be sure, the gods have possessed their sisters; so Saturn wed Ops, related to him by blood, Ocean wed Tethys and the ruler of Olympus wed Juno. But the gods have their own laws. Why do I try to judge the different rules of human customs by the standards of heaven?' Her desire for her brother is marked as yet more transgressive by the allusion at the beginning and end of her story to an Olympian brother-sister pair to whose example she does not appeal. Byblis and Caunus are the children of Cyanee by Miletus, a son of Apollo. The object of Byblis' love is introduced by an intrusive reference to her and her brother's grandfather, 455 'Byblis Apollinei correpta cupidine fratris'; at the end she is referred to as 663 'Phoebeia Byblis'. The reference to their twin birth at 453, 'prolem est enixa gemellam', is a further reminder of their ancestral origins; the Metamorphoses subscribes to the version in which Apollo and Diana are twins 6.336 'edidit ... geminos Latona'.8' 76 So R. K. Gibson, Ovid Ars Amatoria Book 3 (2003), on Ars 3.391-2, reporting a suggestion by Michael Haslam. For Ovid our common ancestors are also labelled as siblings, Met. 1.351 (Deucalion to Pyrrha, after the flood) 'o s?ror, o coniunx, o femina sola superstes', although in fact they are first cousins, soror can be used of a cousin, but the Ovidian pairing with soror irresistibly suggests the epic label for Juno, as at Met. 3.265-6 'Iouisque | et soror et coniunx'. For a rich collection of materials see R. Ferri, Octavia. A Play Attributed to Seneca (2003), 188-9, on v. 220 'soror Augusti coniunxque'. 77 In the final scene between Jupiter and Juno in Aen. 12 Juno does indeed digest her anger (831 'irarum ... fluctus'). 78 e.g. Cat. 72.1-2 'dicebas quondam solum te nosse Catullum, | Lesbia, nee prae me uelle tenere Iouem'. Kroll compares Met. 7.800-1 'mutua cura duos et amor socialis habebat, | nee louis illa meo thalamos praeferret amori'. 79 Cic., Att. 2.9.1; 2.12.2; 2.14.1; 2.22.5; 2.23.3. See Moreau, op. cit. (n. 9), 78; T. P. Wiseman, Catullus and his World (1985), 43. 80 As pointed out by Harrison, op. cit. (n. 16). 81 A. Feldherr, 'Reconciling Niobe', in D. Nelis (ed.), Aetas Ovidianai\ Hermathena 177-8 (2004/05), 125-46, at 126, developing the connections between Ovid's Niobe and Cleopatra, suggests that her boast at Met. 6.176 'Iuppiter alter auus; socero quoque glorior illo' may contain a hint of Ptolemaic incest.</page><page sequence="16">40 PHILIP HARDIE Virgil decisively severs the link between divine and human marital institutions, saving Aeneas from incestuous temptations, and at the same time restoring the conjugal - and fraternal - harmony of the gods of the Roman Capitol. In an interview between this couple allusion to the words of the Lock of Berenice carries no ill omen, at least as regards their conjugal relationship. Juno's ascent to the sky may be as unwilling as the Lock's, but it restores her to her rightful partner.82 The Julian gens is freed from the negative asssocia tions of the Coma Berenices, which can now be put to better use as a model for another catasterism, the Caesar(ies) of the sidus Iulium. ALTERNATIVE STORIES But as usual with Virgil things are not quite that simple. The incestuous confusions from which Aeneas extricated himself when he fled from Carthage find a reflection much later in the poem, in the fatal encounter between Camilla and Chloreus. Camilla is in many respects a double of Dido; in battle she meets a Trojan who is in some ways a double of herself, Chloreus, apparently a eunuch as a former priest of Cybele, and so semiuir, as the Amazonian Camilla has put aside her femininity to enter the masculine world of war. Her fascination with the gold and purple worn by Chloreus is perhaps partly to be explained by the fact that she herself wears gold and purple (7.8I4-i6). Camilla has a Lycian quiver (7.8i6), Chloreus a Lycian bow (II.773). Chloreus also shares with Camilla's double, Dido, a threefold repetition of the root aur-: II.774-6 'aureus ex umeris erat arcus et aurea uati I cassida; tum croceam chlamydemque sinusque crepantis I carbaseos fuluo in nodum collegerat auro', 'the priest had a golden bow hanging from his shoulders and a golden helmet; then too his saffron cloak and its rustling folds of linen he had gathered into a knot with gold'; cf. 4.I38-9 (Dido) 'cui pharetra ex auro, crines nodantur in aurum, I aurea purpuream subnectit fibula uestem'.83 Dido-Diana had intertextually appropriated the attributes of the Callimachean Apollo; Camilla may, the narrator surmises, entertain the idea of physically putting on the clothes of Chloreus (II.779 'captiuo siue ut se ferret in auro'). There is a narcissistic quality to the encounter, but this is a 'twinning' with a murderous plot. However Camilla and Chloreus are fantastic characters from a faraway world, and we contemporary readers of Virgil will not meet their like again in our every day Italy. Our world is the result of a Trojan settlement in Italy based on an exogamous union of peoples. The twin children of Latona make another appearance in the treaty in Book iz, in the list of gods by whom Latinus swears to uphold the peace agreed between his Italians and the Trojans: iz.i98 'Latonaeque genus duplex Ianumque bifrontem'. The Greek genus duplex is paired with the native Italo-Roman biform god. 'The prominence of these dual deities may relate to the proposed union of Trojans and Latins.'84 The treaty will be broken, but only temporarily, and the settlement between Trojan and Italian, one of the foundation legends contained in the Aeneid, will be bound by its terms after the death of Turnus. But the death of Turnus prefigures another, indeed the, Roman foundation legend, in which twin murders twin, Romulus' killing of Remus. Dido and Turnus corres pond as the major obstacles to Aeneas' mission in respectively Carthage and Italy; they 82 On the ascent of the Lock/of Juno see Wills, op. cit. (n. 56), 299; 301 n. 43 on the problem of 12.842 'excedit caelo'; Feeney's suggestion cedit (CQ 34 (1984), 184 n. 33) is tempting. 83 Chloreus is the most outlandish of the Trojans, the one who most closely approximates to the negative stereotype of Numanus (9.614-20); the only other Trojan who comes close to him in garish apparel is Aeneas at Carthage (4.261-4), but that costume is the gift of Dido, not imported from Troy. 84 Richard Tarrant, forthcoming commentary on Aen. 12, on 198. Apollo and Diana are perhaps to be understood in their roles as Sun and Moon (Sol opens the list of gods by whom Aeneas swears at 176).</page><page sequence="17">VIRGIL S PTOLEMAIC RELATIONS 4I share among other things a tendency to turn into doubles of Aeneas.15 With Dido Aeneas commits allusive incest; Aeneas kills Turnus in allusive fratricide. Fratricide is the inverse of incest, the result of a hatred rather than a desire that chooses an object too close to itself, and the two are paired in Roman mythological thinking: fratricide and incest (of mother with son) open and close the list of crimes that, according to Catullus 64, charac terize the wicked present day, since men chased away justice (399, 403-4). Incest and fratricide together dominate the plot of Seneca's Phoenissae.86 The Theban cycle is often used by Roman writers to mirror Roman anxieties. Virgil's readers might reflect uncom fortably on the fact that the court of Ptolemaic Egypt was notorious for fratricide as well as incest, especially under its last ruler Cleopatra, who was responsible for the murder of her two brothers (and husbands), Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV. Dido, so she rages when she sees the Trojans sailing away, would have murdered Aeneas (4.600-I), a figurative fratricide that Aeneas manages to escape, but heading for a future in which fratricide will be foundational. One mythological model that Virgil does not succeed in importing from Alexandria into the Aeneid is that of the Dioscuri, loving siblings who make the transition from mortal to divine, and as such appear as saviour-gods, ltfpcq and A6EX0oi like the Ptolemaic rulers.87 Corpus Christi College, Oxford 85 For a suggestive development of the idea that both Dido and Turnus function as 'second selves' to Aeneas see Nortwick, op. cit. (n. 10), 89-182; for Turnus as a double of Aeneas see also P. Hardie, The Epic Successors of Virgil (1993), 33-4 86 E. Fantham, 'Nihil iam iura naturae ualent: incest and fratricide in Seneca's Phoenissae', Ramus 12 (1983), 61-76. 87 Cameron, op. cit.

Introduction, Text, and Commentary (1997), 23. Aeneas appeals to the example of Pollux at Aen. 6.121 'si fratrem Pollux alterna morte redemit', but the plot of the Aeneid does not allow for the kind of use made of the mythological brothers by Tiberius to commemorate his fraternal love for the dead Drusus, dedicating the restored Temple of Castor and Pollux in both their names in a.D. 6: Dio 55.27.4; Ov., Fasti 1.705-8 'at quae uenturas praecedit sexta Kalendas, | hac sunt Ledaeis templa dicata deis: | fratribus illa deis fratres de gente deorum | circa Iuturnae composuere lacus' (see S.
