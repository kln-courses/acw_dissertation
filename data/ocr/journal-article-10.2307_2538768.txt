<plain_text><page sequence="1">Technology and the Donald MacKenzie Arms Race Review: Innovation and the Arms Race: How the United States and the Soviet Union Develop New Military Technologies by Matthew Evangelista Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988, 300 pp. For at least the last two decades-and in many senses longer-scholars have struggled to come to grips with the role of technological change in the arms race. There is more to weaponry than high technology, more to the competition of the Soviet Union and the United States than weaponry, and more to the relationship of the superpowers than the simplistic competition implied in the metaphor of a race. Yet the basic question continues to press itself on us, not just because no wholly compelling answer to it has been formulated, but because it matters. Matthew Evangelista prefaces Innovation and the Arms Race by quoting Robert 0. Keohane: We think about world politics not because it is aesthetically beautiful, because we believe that it is governable by simple, knowable laws, or because it provides rich, easily accessible data for the testing of empirical hypotheses. Were those concerns paramount, we would look elsewhere. We study world politics because we think it will determine the fate of the earth.1 Evangelista's concerns are made no less relevant by the publication of his book at a moment of almost unprecedented hope for an end, or at least a significant lessening, of weapons competition between East and West. For one could argue that it was changing technology-and particularly MIRV, making possible the destruction of several missile silos by one attacking Donald MacKenzie is Reader in Sociology, University of Edinburgh, and author of the forthcoming Inventing Accuracy: An Historical Sociology of Nuclear Missile Guidance. 1.

In this official view, technology is what social scientists call a dependent variable. Political and military leaders, at least on "our" side, assess the threats to the security of their nations and alliances. They then select amongst the technologies available, or provide resources for the creation of new technologies, in order to meet these threats rationally. Strategic goals come first; technology follows.3 This view has seemed to many just too optimistic and rationalistic to be true. In reaction to it, many scholars of strategic studies and international politics have reached for versions of technological determinism, though nor- mally in isolation from the wider debates around this latter position.4 Ralph Lapp's Arms Beyond Doubt: The Tyranny of Weapons Technology,5 and works by other authors as influential as Hans Bethe, Herbert York, and Lord Zucker- man,6 all reversed the causal order implicit in the official view. Although the 2. It would be far too simplistic to argue that MIRV (multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicle) was the only cause of the end of this earlier detente. For one attempt at a more rounded account see Fred Halliday, The Making of the Second Cold War (London: Verso, 1983). 3. The most significant departure from the official view amongst elite groups has been the result of the influence on Soviet orthodoxy of a technologically determinist form of Marxism. See David Holloway, "Doctrine and Technology in Soviet Armaments Policy," in Derek Leebaert, ed., Soviet Military Thinking (London: Allen and Unwin, 1977), pp. 259-291. 4. A measure of that isolation is the infrequency of citation, even in recent work on technology and the arms race, of what is perhaps the most useful discussion of technological determinism within political theory: Langdon Winner, Autonomous Technology: Technics-out-of-Control as a Theme in Political Thought (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1977). 5.

If a thing was technically possible, then it had to be done. Such was the terrible thrust of technology in the nuclear-missile era. Technology, itself, was proving to be the great enemy of arms control."7 These authors all saw this technological determinism as a condition to be deplored, and sought means of reasserting the proper primacy of politics over technology. Their diagnosis that technological determinism was the malady at the root of the arms race was, however, in turn challenged by others who argued that politics was already in command, but not the be- nignly rational politics of the official version. Political interests underpinned the creation and selection of new weapons technologies, but these interests had more to do with, for example, maintaining and extending global influ- ence than deterring an attack on one's population.8 Again, the policy conclu- sion was clear, at least in the more radical versions of this position. Compla- cency was misplaced, as was any attempt to help the existing political system gain control of technological change: that system itself had to be challenged.

Though there is a distinct family resemblance among the positions of these authors, not all would accept the label "technological determinism," nor would all put matters as strongly as Lapp. Further- more, different authors, and sometimes the same author on different occasions, equivocate on whether the determinism resides in the very process of technological change, or in the (social) power of technologists and their institutions. 7.

I am citing only authors who have addressed the question centrally; many others can be seen as implicitly leaning towards this third position, though often inconsistently, and with enormous differences as to what sort of politics (geopolitical, "imperialist," bureaucratic, etc.) are actually in command of technology.</page><page sequence="4">International Security 14:1 1 164 Theorizing "Politics" As I have noted, this debate about the role of technological change in the arms race took place largely in isolation from analogous discussions taking place in political theory, and also in sociology and economics.9 It has, how- ever, been more closely connected to another set of issues within political science, that of the nature of the processes determining state policy-in particular whether those processes are primarily internal to a given state, or have their base in its relations to other states. The latter answer is of course the one given by the perspective known as "realism," whose three main premises are usefully summarized by Robert 0. Keohane: "that states are the key actors in world politics; that they seek power, either as an end or as a means to other ends; and that they rationally seek to advance their interests. "10 In the 1960s and early 1970s these premises, which are of course more widely held than just by those authors labeled "realist," were subject to major criticism, both methodological and substan- tive. It was argued that it was fundamentally mistaken, methodologically, to see policy as decision. That term's connotation of a unitary decision-maker, analogous to an individual human possessing goals and rationally selecting means to achieve those goals, was an anthropomorphic illusion. "America," say, decides nothing, intends nothing, plans nothing. Echoing a closely- related debate in economics, where the rationalistic neo-classical perspective was subject to criticism similar to that of realism within political science, it was argued that policy was outcome-the often inconsistent resultant of organ- izational routines and the conflict and compromise among political actors."1 These actors were, it was claimed, typically governmental bureaucracies rather than, say, individuals, legislatures, or parties: hence this perspective's most common label, "bureaucratic politics." Here the methodological criti- 9. I discuss some of the parallels in chapter eight of Inventing Accuracy: An Historical Sociology of Nuclear Missile Guidance (forthcoming). 10. Robert 0. Keohane, "Alliances, Threats, and the Uses of Neorealism," International Security, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Summer 1988), pp. 169-176, at p. 173 n. 11. A common root of both the economics and political science versions of this argument is the work of Herbert Simon, such as "A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice," Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 69 (1955), pp. 99-118. Simon's influence is evident in, for example, Graham T. Allison, Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis (Boston: Little, Brown, 1971); and John Steinbruner, The Cybernetic Theory of Decision: New Dimensions of Political Analysis (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1974). The twin analogies-between neo-classical economics and realism, and between the "behavioral theory of the firm" inspired by Simon, and the bureaucratic politics approach-are close.</page><page sequence="5">Technology and the Arms Race 1 165 cism of realism began to shade into contrary substantive claims, claims that were rightly attacked as giving undue salience to bureaucracies.12 Most im- portantly, however, bureaucratic politics, and its in-principle similar relative, the theory of the military-industrial complex,13 fueled a perspective in which it was domestic politics, rather than relations between states, that was seen as central to the arms race. The bureaucratic politics critique of anthropomorphism does not, however, logically imply the substantive conclusion that the core of the arms race is an Eigendynamik (internal dynamic),14 and the processes analyzed by the realists irrelevant. For if the U.S. Air Force, say, can be a political actor, can be influenced by the world outside it (by what the U.S. Navy does, for example), so can the American state. In other words, if supra-individual entities are allowed at all as actors, then there are no purely methodological grounds for admitting one level of entity (a bureaucracy) and excluding others (a state),15 or for assuming that only domestic, and not international, circum- stances will influence the course of events. Evangelista's Solution Amongst these familiar, but seldom rigorously analyzed, issues, Evangelista treads sure-footedly. What he does is develop a model of innovation in weaponry that is both sequential and comparative. The process, as he sees 12. See, for example, Robert J. Art, "Bureaucratic Politics and American Foreign Policy: A Critique," Policy Sciences, Vol. 4 (1973), pp. 467-490; Desmond Ball, "The Blind Men and the Elephant: A Critique of the Bureaucratic Politics Theory," Australian Outlook, Vol. 28 (1974), pp. 71-92. 13. In an analytic sense, all that this theory does is to shift the emphasis to another set of organizations, the producers of weapons technology, and to their intimate relations with the armed services. The theory of the military-industrial complex is of course subject to precisely the same empirical criticism as bureaucratic politics-that it grants too much importance to the particular set of organizations it chooses to focus on. 14. The leading theorist of this is Dieter Senghaas: see, for example, his Ruistung und Militarismus (Armament and militarism) (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1972). It is one of the strengths of Evangelista's book that, unlike many Anglo-Saxon authors, he is aware of and draws upon the theoretical literature in German on the arms race, such as Senghaas's work. 15. That an Eigendynamik can be a structural process, rather than an observable interaction between organizations, does not disturb this conclusion. It is, however, worth noting that the bureaucratic politics approach, as actually practiced, tended to share the general bias of American pluralist political science toward the study of the observable influence of particular actors on contested decisions, thus missing the structural processes that define agendas, actors, and their interests. There is a most useful discussion of this aspect of pluralism in Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974).</page><page sequence="6">International Security 14:1 1 166 it, has distinct phases, and the different factors (technological and political, internal and external) have different weights in different phases. Further- more, it happens differently in different countries, specifically the United States and Soviet Union. He applies (and, in a limited sense, tests) his model not only for cases culled from existing literature, but in an extended empirical discussion of the development of tactical nuclear weapons in the United States and the Soviet Union. Almost uniquely, he is equally at home with his two sets of primary sources: to many students of Western weapons, the linguistic and practical barriers to the detailed study of Soviet developments have been overwhelming, while those who have made the investment in overcoming these barriers have perhaps been disinclined to devote time to the "easy" study of events in the United States. THE U.S. CASE Evangelista focuses on radical technological innovations, those that lead to "significant changes-for example, in the realm of strategy, in the organiza- tion of military forces, or in the distribution of resources among services" (p. 51). In the United States, he suggests, these do not originate from demands formulated by political or military elites.16 Initiatives come, rather, from sci- entists and technologists: in the case of tactical nuclear weapons, from sci- entists involved in the atomic weapons program, particularly Robert Oppen- heimer. In the second stage of the innovation process, these scientists and technologists recruit allies in the military, and seek to build a consensus in the military-technological community around the value of their proposal. Here, at least sometimes, they clash with those who have alternative projects. Thus the proponents of tactical nuclear weapons clashed with the advocates of the "Super," or hydrogen bomb, but found supporters in the U.S. Army, which was being disadvantaged by the dominance of strategic bombing. In the third stage, this process of support-building extends beyond the military-technological community to the armed services more generally, to the executive branch, and to Congress. For example, in a situation where support for nuclear propulsion was far from certain, Admiral Hyman Rick- over secured the future of the nuclear submarine by persuading high officials, members of Congress, and, most importantly, President Truman to attend 16. Evangelista (p. 50) acknowledges a particular debt to James Kurth, "A Widening Gyre: The Logic of American Weapons Procurement," Public Policy, Vol. 19, No. 2 (Summer 1971), pp. 373-404, in formulating his model as it applies to the United States.</page><page sequence="7">Technology and the Arms Race | 167 the widely-publicized keel-laying ceremony for the first such submarine, the Nautilus. During this stage, external threats are not normally necessary to justify projects, although potential military uses-such as of tactical nuclear weapons in the Korean War17-are certainly signaled. In stage four of the process, when a project is passing from advanced research and development to prototype production, a threat does become more necessary as justifica- tion-but the threat may be conjured up as much as real, and may be quite vague. For tactical nuclear weapons, the threat was that the Soviet Union might take advantage of its supposedly massive conventional superiority to invade Western Europe. Finally, in the fifth stage of the process, and normally drawing justification from a more specific "threat," top-level executive and congressional endorsement of the mass production of the new weapon is secured. THE SOVIET CASE Matters happen quite differently in the Soviet Union, Evangelista argues. The Soviet military-technological effort is enormous, and the talent of its personnel considerable, but the Soviet system's obsession with the fulfillment of the quantitative demands of the "plan," together with the compartmen- talization, bureaucratization, and excessive secrecy of military research and development, militates against the indigenous generation of radical innova- tions. So the first stage of the innovation process in the Soviet Union is what Evangelista calls "stifled initiative": ideas exist which can later be seen as the germ of new systems, but "organizational and systemic constraints [prevent] the actual pursuit of potential developments that do not coincide with exist- ing priorities" (p. 69). During the second stage of the process, pursuit of these developments is stepped up, often in response to analogous foreign developments or to threats. They are still not given high priority, but the preparatory work is useful to later stages of the process. The top leadership gets actively involved much earlier in the innovation process in the Soviet Union than in the United States, and in the third stage of the process this top leadership reconsiders the balance of priorities between existing and new programs. This is not brought about by lobbying from below (as in the United States), but is the result of the leadership's perception of events abroad. In the case of tactical 17. Evangelista notes (pp. 121-122) that the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Korea was implicitly supported by the editors of the now "dovish" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.</page><page sequence="8">International Security 14:1 1 168 nuclear weapons, the events that transformed a low level of Soviet interest were probably the American deployment of these weapons in Europe in 1953, together with changing U.S. doctrinal statements indicating apparent willingness to use nuclear weapons in response to local conflicts. The death of Stalin also permitted wider reconsideration of the implications of atomic weapons for warfare than had hitherto been possible. In the fourth stage of the process, the top leadership's considerable weight is applied to re-ordering priorities and overcoming organizational and re- source constraints on radical innovation. A whole network of research, de- velopment and production facilities was, for example, brought into being for the Soviet ballistic missile program, with direct, personal involvement from Stalin and other leaders. Finally, in a fifth stage of "mass production," the considerable capacities of the Soviet system for planned mobilization come into play; military doctrine shifts to accommodate the innovation; and some- times substantial organizational changes are made, as in the establishment of the Strategic Rocket Forces as a separate branch of the armed services. What Evangelista thus does, in relation to the above debates concerning technology and the arms race, is to grant what one might call "local," but not "universal," validity to each of the main contending positions. An inter- nal, Eigendynamik, analysis in his view works quite well for weapons inno- vation in the United States, where external threats come into play only relatively late in the innovation process, and more as justifications for pro- grams than as their true causes. The formal political system and military strategy are definitely not in positive command of technology-new tech- nologies are not the result of pre-existing political or military requirements- and they are only sometimes in negative command of it, able to stop pro- grams regarded as unnecessary or foolish. For the United States, then, Evan- gelista inclines to the technologically determinist position. He does not, however, grant technology in itself autonomous power. Innovations can be shaped by innovators' "non-technical" goals: Oppenheimer and his col- leagues pressed for tactical nuclear weapons because they wanted an alter- native to all-out strategic bombing. And successful innovation always in- volves what John Law calls heterogeneous engineering: the organization and manipulation of people and their institutions, as well as wires and equa- tions. 18 18. See John Law, "Technology and Heterogeneous Engineering: The Case of the Portuguese</page><page sequence="9">Technology and the Arms Race 1 169 "External" developments are, by comparison, the central causes of radical innovations in the Soviet system: the latter are much more "reactions" to previous Western "actions" than they are internally generated. There is little indication of the operation of anything one might call a "technological im- perative," and politics (embodied in top Communist Party leaders) remains firmly in command of technology. Innovation is a "top down" process, rather than the substantially "bottom up" one it is in the United States. These differences between the United States and the Soviet Union are not accidental, Evangelista argues. They arise from the systemic differences that make the United States technically innovative, and stifle innovation in the USSR, and also from the differences in the relations between state and society in the two countries. The American state is characterized by multiple and overlapping jurisdictions (in part the result of the deliberately constructed balance of power between executive, legislature, and judiciary) and by the relatively permeable boundary between state and civil society, while the Soviet state is much more clearly hierarchical. The differences that he finds between the processes of "arms dynamics" in the United States and Soviet Union lead Evangelista to an important policy conclusion. The best hope for ending the arms race lies in a compromise in which each side yields its major source of strength: the United States trades its military-technological innovativeness (agreeing, for example, not to pur- sue the Strategic Defense Initiative) in return for reductions in Soviet quan- titative strength. Assessing Evangelista's Solution In broad-brush terms, Evangelista's solution is persuasive. The absence of "simple, knowable laws" of the arms race-shown by the decades of fruitless search for them19-makes eminently sensible his strategy of distinguishing the factors at work in different countries and different stages of the innova- Expansion," in Wiebe E. Bijker, Thomas P. Hughes, and Trevor Pinch, eds., The Social Construc- tion of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1987), pp. 111-134. 19. Although it is not directly relevant here, since it mainly concerns quantitative change (in budgets, numbers of weapons, etc.) rather than qualitative, technological change, this is partic- ularly evident in the "Richardsonian" search for formal, mathematical models of arms race behavior. See Hakan Wiberg, "Arms Rages, Formal Models, and Quantitative Tests," forthcom- ing in Nils Petter Gleditsch and Olav Nj0lstad, eds., Arms Races: Technological and Political Dynamics (London: Sage, 1989).</page><page sequence="10">International Security 14:1 1 170 tion process. His account of the weapons innovation process is consistent, in general terms, with the best modern scholarship.20 There are cases that do not altogether fit-Soviet development of the H-bomb, ICBM, and ABM was less reactive than the model suggests-but Evangelista takes proper note of them (pp. 240-245), concluding only that his model works better than its predominantly uni-factorial competitors. His proposal to end the technolog- ical arms race by "grand compromise," exchanging U.S. "quality" for Soviet "quantity," is timely. For example, a deal trading "U.S. restraint in the next major technological innovation (SDI) in return for Soviet cutbacks in the previous major innovation (multiple-warhead ICBMs)" (p. 261) could very well form the centerpiece of a Gorbachev-Bush agreement. So what I have to register is less a disagreement than a sense of areas where further work is needed. Demoting contending theoretical positions from universal to local validity works in the sense that the resulting model is useful for both description and policy-making, but analytical tensions remain. For example, bureaucratic politics theory, as I emphasized above, should be seen not principally as a set of substantive claims about the importance of bureaucracies, but as a methodological position. What is at issue between it and realism is not just the latter's emphasis on processes within the inter- national system of states: it is also whether state policy-making can be thought of as akin to individual, rational decision-making. However impor- tant "external" factors may be, this latter way of thinking cannot, it seems to me, be sustained, except perhaps in those particular circumstances where policy literally is the decision of an individual such as the president. The inescapable nature of analytical issues such as this would suggest a theoretical strategy somewhat different from Evangelista's. Rather than seek- ing to specify where and when the "internal" is more important than the "external," we need to think through the ways in which the structural or systemic context shapes the "pulling and hauling" of bureaucratic actors and its outcome.21 Evangelista provides a useful way to begin, in his emphasis, described above, on differences in state/society relations,22 but it is just a 20. Compare, for example, Evangelista's conclusions about the process in the Soviet Union with those of David Holloway, The Soviet Union and the Arms Race (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983). 21. Evangelista (p. 232) draws the metaphor of "pulling and hauling" from Graham T. Allison and Morton H. Halperin, "Bureaucratic Politics: A Paradigm and Some Policy Implications," in Richard H. Ullman and Raymond Tanter, eds., Theory and Policy in International Relations (Prince- ton: Princeton University Press, 1972), p. 43. 22. Here he is drawing on an important body of work by authors including Theda Skocpol,</page><page sequence="11">Technology and the Arms Race 1 171 start. Work along these lines matters not just for theoretical completeness, but because there are important substantive issues that, it seems to me, can only be addressed in this way, for example, explaining the shifting balance of assured destruction and counterforce in U.S. nuclear strategy. This is an issue that, while doctrinal rather than directly technological, is perhaps more intimately related to technological change in strategic weaponry than any other. Domestic political processes, including bureaucratic "pulling and haul- ing," have unquestionably affected this shifting balance; while so have pro- cesses within the international system of states.23 Neither set of processes seems definitely more important than the other, even at any particular point in time: the task is to develop a theoretical understanding of how they relate. The other major loose ends left untied by Evangelista concern technology specifically. The first arises from Evangelista's focus on radical technological change. As he is fully aware, there is at least one24 other form of technological change: incremental. Strategic ballistic missile guidance technology provides a good example. With the exception of the introduction of stellar-inertial guidance for submarine-launched ballistic missiles, the changes that have taken place in guidance technology have virtually all taken the form of gradual improvements to the same underlying designs, both at the system and component level. But the cumulative consequence of these changes has Stephen D. Krasner, and Peter J. Katzenstein. See Skocpol, States and Social Revolutions (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979); see also the essays in Peter B. Evans, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, and Theda Skocpol, eds., Bringing the State Back In (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985); Krasner, Defending the National Interest: Raw Materials Investments and U.S. Foreign Policy (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978); Katzenstein, "International Relations and Domestic Structures: Foreign Economic Policies of Advanced Industrial States," International Organization, Vol. 30, No. 1 (Winter 1976), pp. 1-45. This body of work has, however, not addressed arms race questions as such. 23. For the "pulling and hauling," see for example Ted Greenwood, Making the MIRV: A Study of Defense Decision-Making (Cambridge, Mass.: Ballinger, 1975). For stimulating discussions of the influence of the state system, see Roberts, "Preparing to Fight"; and Earl C. Ravenal, "Counterforce and Alliance: The Ultimate Connection," International Security, Vol. 6, No. 4 (Spring 1982), pp. 26-43. 24. Mary Kaldor argues that what she calls "baroque" technological change is distinct from both revolutionary and conservative/incremental change. Baroque change is conservative in the sense that innovation focuses on continuous improvement to the same parameters of the same basic weapons system, and thus does not fundamentally disturb military organization, but it often involves radical innovation in the means used to achieve those improvements. See Kaldor, "The Weapons Succession Process," World Politics, Vol. 38, No. 4 (July 1986), pp. 585-587; and Kaldor, The Baroque Arsenal (London: Deutsch, 1982). It is also worth noting that the boundary between "radical" and "incremental" innovations is far from clear, and depends on from whose per- spective one is looking. The neutron bomb, discussed by Evangelista (pp. 245-254), is an example of an ambiguous case.</page><page sequence="12">International Security 14:1 1 172 been qualitative rather than merely quantitative: the ICBM, seen in the 1950s as primarily a "city-buster," is now seen as primarily a "time-urgent hard- target killer." So incremental change is far from unimportant. It also raises different issues from revolutionary change. On the one hand, the gradual, cumulative nature of incremental change makes more plausible the technologically de- terminist notion that here we have a "natural trajectory" of technological change: and, indeed, that is how the example of missile guidance has pri- marily been understood in the literature.25 On the other hand, however, because incremental change is much more predictable than revolutionary change, it is more subject to explicit management, to shaping according to strategic and political goals. Military and political leaders, wishing high mis- sile accuracy because of the counterforce capability it promises, have known how to bring it into being, because they have been able to anticipate the pay- off from specific research and development investments.26 So, paradoxically, the "politics-in-command" view of technical change also seems more plau- sible for incremental change. Here is not the place to seek to resolve this paradox. Let me note, however, that the case-study approach typical of most of the empirical work on tech- nology and the arms race is next to useless when it comes to understanding incremental change.27 In their focus on a particular innovation or weapon system, case studies are poorly equipped to deal with the causes and con- sequences of changes that happen gradually over decades, such as the de- velopment of the state-of-the-art of an incremental technology. A different methodology is needed that is both more historical (for this reason), and also more analytical.28 25. See, for example, Shapley, "Technology Creep." The notion of a "natural trajectory" of technology is drawn from Richard R. Nelson and Sidney G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change (Cambridge: Belknap/Harvard University Press, 1982), pp. 258-262; see also Giovanni Dosi, "Technological Paradigms and Technological Trajectories: A Suggested Interpre- tation of the Determinants of Technical Change," Research Policy, Vol. 11 (1982), pp. 147 162. 26. Two cases in point have been the U.S. Air Force's funding of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Instrumentation Laboratory, and Defense Secretary James Schlesinger's establishment of the Improved Accuracy Program for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. See MacKenzie, Inventing Accuracy. 27. Though Evangelista's work is vastly superior, in its analytical rigor and comparative nature, to most of the weapon system case studies, it still has something of a case-study methodology to it (pp. 51 and 84-85). 28. This argument is developed in Donald MacKenzie, "Towards an Historical Sociology of Nuclear Weapons Technologies," forthcoming in Gleditsch and Nj0lstad, Arms Races.</page><page sequence="13">Technology and the Arms Race 1 173 An analytical approach is needed because of the final loose end that needs to be tied-though tying this one is indeed a major task, one that bears on the study of revolutionary as well as incremental innovations, and one to be found loose in many works other than Evangelista's. What causes technology to change in one way rather than another? Why do we get radical, or incremental, change, and indeed why particular radical or incremental changes? This question has seldom been properly thought through in studies of the arms race, or subject to adequate empirical investigation. This may be because of the dominance of the-false29-assumption that the answer to it lies either in an internal logic of technology or in the implications of scientific advance; or the equally a priori certainty that "high" politics must be in command of technology. But whatever the reason, neglect of the causes of technical change has often meant analytical inconsistency, to be found, for example, in much of the bureaucratic politics approach. As Evangelista notes (p. 12), writers within this approach often treat technological change, in classic tech- nologically determinist manner, as an autonomous factor, an independent variable disturbing bureaucratic continuity. Yet many of the bureaucratic politics studies can also be cited as evidence against technological determin- ism, because they show technology to be a dependent variable. Military bureaucracies, after all, are often built around a particular weapon system, and commitment to the organization and commitment to the technology become indistinguishable.30 Conflict over the shaping of technology, often over very detailed technical design features, is the very stuff of bureaucratic "pulling and hauling," and even when pulling and hauling is not evident, the overall pattern of military organization may still be exerting a structural shaping effect.31 In forcing us to consider how technological change is shaped, the study of the role of technology in arms dynamics thus raises a question of consid- 29. See MacKenzie and Wajcman, Social Shaping of Technology. 30. This is one way of formulating the classic discussion by Robert L. Perry on why the U.S. Air Force resisted the ballistic missile. See Perry, The Ballistic Missile Decisions, P-3686 (Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND, 1967). 31. Examples of bureaucratic processes shaping military technology are found in Michael H. Armacost, The Politics of Weapons Innovation: The Thor-Jupiter Controversy (New York: Columbia University Press, 1969) and-though it explicitly distances itself from the substantive claims of bureaucratic politics-Greenwood, Making the MIRV. Both show how important technical fea- tures of missile systems were shaped by organizational politics-explicit interservice conflict between the U.S. Air Force and Army, in the case described by Armacost, and implicit structural rivalry between Air Force and Navy, in that discussed by Greenwood.</page><page sequence="14">International Security 14:1 1 174 erable generality. Though a full answer to the question is nowhere to be found, a harmful consequence of the ghettoization of the discussion of weap- ons technology has been that clues and helpful resources from other fields have not been picked up, and at least occasionally claims can be found that simply would not pass muster in other areas.32 As I have indicated, Evangelista does not fall into the trap of considering technology as an independent variable. He also goes some of the way to seeking help from other disciplines in order to explain technological change, but only some of the way. Thus in Chapter Two of Innovation and the Arms Race he draws usefully on wider literature to discuss the social circumstances that promote or repress innovation. But important though this question is, it is only part of the wider subject matter of the sociology of technology. What has been called the "new" sociology of technology has sought to explain not just the rate of invention, and the extent to which inventions are adopted, but also their content.33 The latter field is as yet in quite a preliminary stage of development, and it has much to learn from the study of the dynamics of weapons technology- in the rich concrete material of the latter, such as Evangelista's study of the origins of tactical nuclear weapons, and in the hypotheses about shaping processes that are beginning to be framed for weapons technology.4 But perhaps the sociology of technology has some things to teach as well: for 32. Examples of the latter are invidious, because when an issue is not being treated as central, comments on it may be off-hand rather than considered judgments. Thus consider Lord Zuck- erman's remark that "the pure or fundamental science of today inexorably becomes the applied science and technology of tomorrow" ("Science Advisers," p. 246)-a claim that cannot be sustained in the light of the considerable literature on the science-technology relationship, for which see Barry Barnes and David Edge, eds., Science in Context: Readings in the Sociology of Science (Milton Keynes, U.K.: Open University Press, and Cambridge: MIT Press, 1982). 33. See Trevor J. Pinch and Wiebe E. Bijker, "The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other," Social Studies of Science, Vol. 14 (1984), pp. 399-441; and Bijker, Hughes, and Pinch, Social Construction of Technological Systems. In one sense there is nothing new, so far, about the "new sociology of technology": many of its insights can be found-perhaps not made as explicit as they could have been-in the rich body of empirical work by historians of technology. A useful guide to some of the latter is John M. Staudenmaier, S.J., Technology's Storytellers: Reweaving the Human Fabric (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1985). 34. Thus Kaldor, "Weapons Succession Process," seeks to specify the social conditions that lead to baroque, to conservative, and to revolutionary technical change in weaponry. Kaldor, it is interesting to note, is one of the scholars of weapons technology with the closest connections to the study of other areas of technology, through her location at the Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex, one of the main European sites of such study.</page><page sequence="15">Technology and the Arms Race 1 175 example, about how best to subject the shaping of technology to empirical investigation, and the analytical pitfalls to avoid. Certainly, developing the links between the different fields whose common subject matter is techno- logical change can only be to the benefit of all, and would further strengthen the study of weapons technology, a study whose growing maturity is sig- naled by the publication of Innovation and the Arms Race.</page></plain_text>
