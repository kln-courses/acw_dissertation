Quezon City: GCF Books, 1989. 264 pages, illus. Folk Architecture is a good example of how not to design a book. The elements for a good book are all there. Text by leading authorities: Rodrigo Perez III, who recently published a monograph on Philippine architecture for theCCP series on the Seven Arts, Rosario Encarnación who collaborated in the now classic Philip-</page><page sequence="2">268 PHILIPPINE STUDIES pine Ancestral Houses, and Julian Dacanay, who published a book on Ethnic Houses. The photographs are competently taken. Much research has gone into tracking down archival photo material. And the architectural plans show the same care found in the earlier book on ancestral houses. But somehow, the pieces don't fit together. The introductory essay shows the unsolved problem faced by the editors. Which comes first, text or image? It is disconcerting to read a long line of text if the eye has to jump from word to word because a folksy rendering of a house, a dragon, an anahaw leaf or a design motif intervenes. On p. 11, for example, ''between the nipa hut and 19th [eyes skip over foliage motif ]-century colonial houses stand houses like those of Panay." And how do you read the essays of Perez, Encarnación and Dacanay? One needs a map to navigate, because this time, short essays on various topics intervene. Here's the guide for Perez's essay: Read pp. 12-15, then 31-41, 44-67, 70-97. For Encarnacion's essay, read pp. 106-107, 116-17, 120-33, 138-53, 157-79. For Dacanay, pp. 184-91, 195-217, 223-30, 232-38, 240-56, 258. That sounds like a sixties adolescent trick done in library books (remember "if you want to know who killed whom, turn to p. 37, then to p. 141, then back to 17 ... ad absurdum"), or like following a lead story in the dailies, and gives one a feeling of the book's design problem. The editors must have had the successful Philippine Ancestral Houses in mind, but there the parenthetical intrusions did not hinder the flow of the main text. Part of the problem stems from the conflict between the magazine-style layout of the book and the conventions of the book form. The choice of type and the manner of highlighting parenthetical essays do not suceed as well as in Philippine Ancestral Houses. One can also nitpick and ask: why an anthropomorphic letter "T" on p. 9 and the ladder-shaped "H" on p. 11, when all other initial capitals follow a different design? Why is the first paragraph on p. 195 in italics when it is obviously a continuation of the main text, italics being reserved for parenthetical essays? But enough of that, what of the content of the essays? Being written by three authors, it is expected that these would be dissimilar. Perez's essay is the most macroscopic, and takes the form of a catalogue. Encarnacion's is most limited in scope, but also the most thorough in analysis; it is also the most original of the three, because very little has been written about the folk houses of Panay. Dacanay's essay takes the form of a catalogue and a participant-observer's log of different Mindanao houses. But the essays still leave one with a sense of unease. Perhaps methodology is involved. Is mere cataloguing enough to understand and appreciate folk archi- tecture? Ascultural artifact, thefolkhouse begs to beinterpreted within a cultural matrix. True, there are references to beliefs, climatological factors, historical antecedents, etc., but these are not too well woven into the essays. Dacanay does some meshing-in in the epilogue of the Mindanao section and Perez in the introduction; but Perez did better when interpreting Philippine architecture for CCP s Tuklas Sining series. Space surrounding space was a recurrent theme of his monograph. Winand Klassen's semiological approach to architecture in Archi- tecture in the Philippines is intellectually more satisfying.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 269 What about the photographs? This is the saving grace of the book. Most are well-taken and the publication of archival photos adds value to the otherwise flawed book. But perhaps this is what the book was, after all. A collection of photographs, never meant to be read through by a reviewer, but to be perused on some leisurely Sunday afternoon just as one peruses the Sunday magazines, only occasionally, turning to the text. And maybe, the eye satisfied, interest aroused, the reader might learn a thing or two about a precious Filipino heritage. Rene B. ] avellana , S.J.
