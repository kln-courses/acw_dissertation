The editors wish to remind our correspondents that notices of scheduled meetings and symposia are of value to our readers only if they appear early enough to make attendance possible. Copy for Notes and News must go to the printer at least six weeks before publication date, and the Notes and News column must be planned and processed in this office. Accordingly, an announcement of a meeting to be held, say, in April, should be sched- uled for our February issue (or sooner) and should be received in this office no later than December 1, that is, at least 4 months in advance. The editors appreciate notices that come to us ready for the printer, requiring little edi- torial work and no retyping, in JOUTRNAL style (see these columns), with no imperatives, no prices, no telephone numbers, no headings, no unneces- sary capitals; and reasonably terse, since space is limited.</page></plain_text>
