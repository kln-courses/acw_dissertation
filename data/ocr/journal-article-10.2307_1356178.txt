<plain_text><page sequence="1">Number 200 December, 1970 THE CREATION OF MAN IN ATRAHASIS I 192-248 WILLIAM L. MORAN The most important single witness to Babylonian speculation on the origins and nature of man is the description of his creation in the first tablet of the Atrahasis Epic, especially lines 192-248.1 However, these fifty-six lines, where so much is new, are-not surprisingly-a tissue of cruces, major and minor. In the remarks that follow we hope to solve some of them, or at least (we refer to the most serious crux of all, lines 914-217 // 927-930) to define for the first time the full scope of the problems involved. The distinction of lines 192-248 is not arbitrary; they constitute a unit, thematically and structurally. They are concerned with the first stage in the creation of man, beginning with the request of the gods to the birth-goddess to form man, and ending with their renaming her, in gratitude for what she had done, " Mistress of all the gods." What follows is another stage; the scene shifts, and Enki and the birth-goddess retire to " the house of destiny," 2 where with other activities they continue the process of man's formation. Reflecting the thematic unity is the structure: narrative (2) 192-193 A gods speech (4) 194-197 narrative (2) 198-199 B birth-goddess speech (4) 200-203 narrative (2) 204-905 C Enki speech (192) 206-917 narrative (12) 218-230 narrative (6) 231-236 B' birth-goddess speech (6) 237-243 narrative (2) 244-245 A' gods speech (2) 246-248 Though this concentric structure, which gives formal expression to the pivotal importance of Enki's speech, the longest and, for the nature of ' We follow the lineation of W. G. Lambert and A. R. Millard, Atra-hasis. The Babylonian Story of the Flood (Oxford, 1969). 2 This seems to be a designation of the room where the child is born; see the passage translated by Jacobsen, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 107/6 (1963) 475, n. 6 = Toward the Image of Tammuz and Other Essays on Meso- potamian History and Culture, ed. William L. Moran (Cambridge, 1970) 322. 3 Here and in lines 237-243, 246-248, we follow Lambert-Millard in the verse count. The distinction of two narrative sections at 218-230, 231-236, is based on the relation- ship of 218-230 (execution) to 206-217 (counsel), and the transition-marker at 231, istiima ("Right after . . ."). The symmetry of the entire passage is striking, especially the balance between speech and narrative beginning at 206 ff. It is prob- ably the explanation why in 218 if. the description of the execution, which in general corresponds word for word with the advice of Enki, omits all reference to 209, 212- 213; having to report the consent of the gods (218-22) and yet apparently wishing to balance speech and narrative, the poet had to omit something. 48</page><page sequence="2">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research man, the decisive intervention, merits detailed analysis, it must suffice here to call attention to the additional evidence of the unity of the passage in the relationship of the final lines to the opening narrative. 192-193 iltam iss?8 i~Sidl1 tabstat ili erintam Mami 246-248 pandmi Mami ni'assiki inanna belet kala ilX lh vumki As is clear, 946-248 harks back to 192-193 and is a kind of inclusio. Note Mami, ill, and the two forms of sasi~. The effect is not only to round off the whole passage, but to contrast effectively the change of status from merely tabsit ili to belet kala ili. In the first speech a minor problem is the translation of 197, 'up'ik ilim awilum lihdi, which has been rendered, " Let man carry the toil of the gods." This version is undoubtedly influenced by supsik ili in I 3 and hupsikkakunu in I 41, both of which associate the corvee with the gods who toil. Against it are the sg. number and-decisively, in our opinion-the structure of the quatrain: attima sassiiru bdniat awilati A-B binima lulla libil abidnam B'-C abs'nam libil : ipir Enlil C'-D supiik ilim awilum lii D'-E The beginning of each line takes up, by repetition or a form of synony- mous parallelism, the end of the previous line. This is patent in B-B' and C-C', which therefore clarify the relationship of D-D'" : ipir Enlil = Vup'ik ilim. Here interest is not in the corv'e as once having been the lot of some of the gods, but in defining the authority under whom it will be borne. In this respect, with the creation of man nothing will be changed, and if this is made explicit, it is perhaps to reject by implication the resignation which, in his pique at the attitude of the striking and rebellious gods, Enlil had offered shortly before (I 170-171). The goddess directs her reply to the attima and its possible implications of her self-sufficiency. To the " Thou art " she begins her answer with ittiydma 1d, " By me alone not . . . ," and then piling up the emphatic ma's (Enkima, .zima) she insists on the necessity and nature of Enki's contribution: ittiydma ld natu ana, epsti By me alone he definitely cannot be fashioned.4 itti Enkima ibasi ipru For Enki alone there's a task at hand. 4 " It is not possible for me to make things " (Lambert-Millard) would be ittiya ld natu ep2ium; besides, in context it does not make sense (see the last two words of the strophe). For 1E, " definitely not," see Akkadisches HandwiSrterbuch 521a; for ep?Au, " to fashion" (rare), cf. I 289 (andkiimi abni ipusd qdtuya). A bit differently J.

Since Enki in the following speech distinguishes his role as purifier from that of provider of clay, this is more likely to be the mind of the goddess.5 But why does she think his powers of purification will be required at all? To answer this question we must go on to Enki's address to the divine assembly. Enki says: ina arhi sebutti u apatti On the new-moon, seventh and fifteenth days teliltam lusa'akin rimka A purification let me institute-a bath. ilam iMt-n litbuhftma The leader-god let them slaughter, then litellilfi ilj ina tibi Let the gods purify themselves by immersion. ina ~iri*u u damis'u With his flesh and his blood Nintu (r) liballil titta Let Nintur mix the clay. ilumma u awilum Let the god himself and man libtallilfi puhur ina titti Be mixed together in the clay. ahridti8 fmi uppa i ni*me For all days to come let's hear the drum. ina ir iii etemmu lib'i In the flesh of the god the ghost shall remain. balta ittaiu lisdisuma Let her inform him while alive of his token, and so assu ld musdi etemmu libgi That there be no forgetting the ghost shall remain. As in the preceding speeches, the basic unit is the quatrain. But, whereas there the formal unity was achieved by either the chain-like construction of A-B, B'-C . .., or the repetition of the particle ma with the first word or phrase (note also ana epiei [1] . . . andku lapuv [4]), here another device is employed: the repetition in the fourth line of a word (s) or a phrase in the second line- tdliltam lIballil titta etemmu libli litellil 6 libtallilt . . . titti etemmu lib.i.7 Structurally, too, the first two quatrains are very similar: first line, a prepositional phrase introduced by ina; second line, second and third 6 Cf.

(note too similarity of litellilt // libtallil'2), final phrase-like the beginning of the strophe-another prep. phrase introduced by ina (and again note similarity of ina tibi // ina titti). This parallelism of the first two strophes sets them off from the third, which thus receives special marking. In the first strophe the last two lines have been thought to mean that the god is to be slaughtered in order that the gods may be purified, thus implying that they are to be cleansed in the blood of the slain god.8 This cannot be right. The structure rules out the possibility of any doubt that the gods are to bathe according to the rite established by Enki, and the god of fresh-waters, and therefore the purifier par excel- lence, does not invent a " blood-bath." Not even exceptionally. There is no evidence that, in Mesopotamian thought, blood was ever believed to be endowed with magical cleansing powers.' As to the purpose of the ablutions, which are presented as necessary once the god is killed, it must be more than to wash off the spatterings of blood. Apparently all the gods must bathe, and the magical powers that are Enki's alone are required. Hence the pollution must be the defilement resulting from the common association with, and responsibility for, death.10 The phrase ilam itien is difficult.11 "The leader-god " may be a bit s Lambert-Millard, 58. Similarly, von Soden, Or NS 26 (1957) 309, but on the basis of a defective manuscript. 1 See A. Leo Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia (Chicago, 1964) 192, 365, n. 18. If the poet here explains the origins of ritual bathings of the gods, this would be another argument against a "blood-bath." The 1st, 7th, and 15th were three of the most sacred days in the monthly calendar. Ritual bathings (Sum. a . tu5. a = Akk. rimku) of the gods are attested for the beginning of the month in the Ur III period; see B. Landsberger, Der kultische Kalender . . . , Leipziger Semitistische Studien VI/1-2, 70, n. 4, and A. Goetze, Journal of Cuneiform Studies 9 (1955) 21. They can be inferred for the OB period, at least at Mari, from Archives royales de Mari I 10, in which ?amgi-Adad says he is waiting for " the (ritual) bathing and the e~iesu-feast"; the latter occurred on the 1st, 7th, and 15th-possibly, too, on the 25th (see Chicago Assyrian Dictionary [CAD] E 373b)-but since the letter was sent on the 30th of Tammuz, reference is probably to the first date. To our knowl- edge, there is no evidence for such bathings on the 7th or 15th, though they may perhaps be inferred from our passage.-Another possible contact between the Atrahasis Epic's " chronology" and the monthly cultic calendar is suggested by the fact that the 26th of the month is the one for nade libitti (8a Ea) Dingir-mah, " setting the brick (of Ea and) Dingir-malb"; see Landsberger, op. cit., 140-141, and, with the omission of Ea and minor variants, J. Nougayrol, Journal of Cuneiform Studies 1 (1947) 333:9', and D. J. Wiseman, Iraq 31 (1969) 179:85'. The brick is undoubtedly the birth-brick, which plays a rather prominent role in the account of man's creation. Now, if we put the mixing of the clay to create man on the 16th and allow 10 days as the equivalent of the 10 months that are counted till man is born (I 280 ff.), we arrive at the 25th or 26th of the month, depending on whether we start with the 16th or 17th. The coincidence seems too close to be fortuitous. 10 See also CAD B 42a; Bott6ro, art. cit. (n. 4), 118; G. Pettinato, Oriens Antiquus 9 (1970) 79. Whether one should speak of murder, as Bottero does, depends on who is killed; on this problem see below. 11 Lambert-Millard, 39, " one god "; Lambert, Compte rendu de l'onzieme Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale (Leiden, 1964), 101, " a 'certain god'." If by " cer- tain " is meant that the identity of the god is known but is to remain nameless, we are in substantial agreement. 51</page><page sequence="5">Number 200 December, 1970 bold as a translation, but it is, we believe, the right interpretation.12 Enki's words cannot be dissociated from Enlil's demand, which begins the discussion leading to the decision to create man, that ilu i.t*n be summoned and punished, and here it seems that he speaks specifically of the rebel leader."3 Moreover, the one whom at Enki's advice the gods put to death is the chief culprit. This explains why he is char- acterized as sa i~ui tima (I 223), and later is said to have been slaughtered qddu t.mi-u (I 239). In the first instance, unless the statement is ironical-and then it would also fit the rebel leader-the meaning can hardly be simply that he had sense or judgment, as if in this respect this obscure god was distinguished from, or surpassed, the other gods. If temu is characteristic of him, it can only be in a specific case or role, and since the latter also explains his death, it is most easily understood of the part he played in the rebellion. It is he, we submit, who was " the god who had the scheme " to overthrow Enlil, and it is this scheme that is effectively ended with his death; he dies " along with his scheme." 14 Having treated his role as purifier, in the next strophe Enki takes up what the birth-goddess is to do with the clay that he is to give her. The problem is the expression in the last two lines, which seem to have man enter into his own composition. To answer this difficulty it has been suggested that " man " be taken to refer to the clay, the component in man that distinguishes him from the gods.'5 But then how are we 12 More cautiously, " the one god." Supporting the possibility of " the leader-god " (cf. also Enfima eli' VI 13) is iat~n in the meaning "foremost" (most probable example, isthn etlum Gilg. P iii 36); cf., too, Sum. dili, lit. "one" = gitmdlu, " noble, perfect." 11 173 (see also Lambert-Millard, 54, K. 8562 ii 9): ilu iithn Aisim[a l]iddisAu UD-ta, " Summon the leader-god so they [the Anunnaki] can . . ." Assuming that the Assyrian recension here faithfully reflects the OB source, against Pettinato, art. cit. (n. 10), 78-79, who believes that Enlil here speaks of his replacement, we follow Lambert-Millard in taking this as a demand for punishment. Since in K. 8562 Anu is apparently willing to pass on this demand to the rebel gods, we cannot see him agreeing to Enlil's abdication, to say nothing of replacing him with one of the strikers. Since the gods from the beginning had sought the main rabble-rouser (I 128-133, 140-145), Enlil's honor would hardly allow him to back down before the refusal of the rebels to disclose their leader's identity, and to settle for just any victim. It may be objected that when Enki speaks there is no indication that the position of the rebels had become any less adamant. However, there is a break before I 189, and here there may have been some brief indication that the strikers had modified their stand or could be safely assumed to do so if the sacrifice of their leader meant their being released from their labors forever. Note that when the senior members among them come to spit on the clay they seem quite familiar with the whole situation (I 233-234). Furthermore, K. 8562 reports a second embassy to the rebels, and in all probability this is either an elaboration of the Old Babylonian tradition, or makes explicit what was there simply assumed.-What Enlil wants done to him is another question. If the expression is related to OB damtam apdkum (so Lambert-Millard), then he literally calls for a burial-mound to be heaped on him (see A. Westenholz, Archiv filr Orientforschung 23 [1970] 27-31), which seems an odd way to demand his execution. Read liddi4tuh bir-tam, " so they can throw him in chain (s) ? " 14 The argumentation is ours, but we owe the interpretation to Thorkild Jacobsen, whom we would here thank for the many hours he has discussed Atrahasis with us. For other views, see Lambert-Millard; von Soden, Or NS 38 (1969) 424; Bottdro, art. cit. (n. 4), 119-120; Pettinato, art. cit. (n. 10), 80. 15 Lambert-Millard, 22. 52</page><page sequence="6">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research to explain " in the clay," which in this review is redundant? The solu- tion, we believe, is that god and man are viewed as being both in a sense end-products. When the goddess finishes mixing the clay, both god and man will be present, but completely fused and compenetrating each other.16 The poet's stress on the presence of the god-ilum-ma- perhaps reflects the fact that man will be made not just from the god's blood, but from his flesh as well. This novelty is connected with another otherwise unparalleled feature that we meet in the next strophe-the ghost. Before attempting to identify this ghost or to resolve any of the ambiguities of the third strophe, we must consider the structure, for, as we remarked in the beginning, it makes clear the full task of the interpreter. Guided by it we may assert that the first line of the strophe may not be treated apart from the lines that follow. As in the case of the opening lines of the first two strophes, it must be integrated with the following line, and these two lines with the next two. The four lines are a unit and must be interpreted as such.'" This is the real problem of the third strophe. Confirming this unity is the considerable number of passages that associate expressions like " for all days to come" (ahrittig fimi) and " not forgetting " (1I muusi).. Especially important is Enfima elli V 76 where Marduk, after fashioning the images of the monsters who had supported Tiamat and placing them at the Bab-Apsi, declares: F[a]rdcita Id imma~id s i lh ittu, " In the future it shall not be forgotten-this (the images) shall be the token." Note: ahrita / aridti9 fmi (line 1), Id immad / Id mUiL (line 4), and also ittu / ittak u (line 3). In view of this passage also relevant is Archives royales de Mari X 141: 25-28: lit ittum infma ,amiz iznunu kussinnima ld tamas9enni, " This is to be a token: When it rains, recall me to mind so you will not forget me." These last two passages not only confirm the inferences we based on structure, but indicate that the token that is mentioned is a memorial. Context and the parallel from Enitma eli' then make it clear that the memory that is to be kept fresh is ultimately that of the dead god; it is his story and its significance that are not to be forgotten. Further- more, as the parallel passages show, this sign should be something per- ceptible like the images or the rain storm. In context there is only one possibility: the sounding uppu. Whose, then, is the ghost: is it man's or the god's? So far only the 1e For the object of baldlu (bullulu) as the end-product rather than an element in the mixture, see I 231; iikaram baldlum, "to mix beer" (CAD B 40b) ; and CAD B 40 1.2' (mixing clay or mortar; see Richard S. Ellis, Foundation Deposits in Ancient Mesopotamia, Yale Near Eastern Researches, 2 [London-New Haven, 1968] 30, n. 131). In the light of these last examples, perhaps the flesh and blood of the god should be compared with the precious substances like wine, honey, ghee, etc. that are occasionally mixed with building-clay. Botttro, art. cit. (n. 4), 118, "... du dieu et de l'homme / Se trouveront m4ls . ." 17 This has been recognized by no one. In Lambert-Millard at least the first two lines are treated as a unit. "I We may refer simply to the entries ahrdtak, ahratu, and abritiA in CAD. Note that in all cases there is question of the indefinite future; this rules out Pettinato, art. cit. (n. 10), 79. 53</page><page sequence="7">Number 200 December, 1970 first possibility has been considered.-' This would certainly be legitimate if there were clear outside evidence establishing the ghost's identity; or if on this hypothesis, and this hypothesis alone, the text made satis- factory sense; or, finally, if the concept of a god's ghost were demon- strably alien to Mesopotamian thought. However, none of these alter- natives is verified. No such evidence exists; the difficulties with the hypothesis are either conceded or are evident,20 and the idea that dead gods, like dead men, survived as ghosts is not only in accord with the profoundly anthropomorphic conception of the divine in Mesopotamia, but is actually attested.21 The possibility, therefore, that the ghost in question is the god's must be seriously entertained. It is supported, we believe, by several con- siderations. The first is context. The previous two strophes are con- cerned, in one way or another, with a death. Then, in the third strophe, a ghost is mentioned. Nothing prepares the reader (hearer) for a radical shift of interest from the creation of man for the service of the gods to his mortality and his after-life. The reader naturally associates the ghost with the death-the only death-he has just heard so much about. Secondly, this ghost is somehow to cooperate in keeping fresh the memory of the dead god. Who is more likely to be given this task, the ,ghost of man or of the god himself? Thirdly, if the ghost is man's, then in the corresponding narrative one must assume that the poet very briefly abandons his narrative about the events concerned with man's creation, looks into the rather distant future, and tells us that man's ghost actually did come into existence. While such a prolepsis may be possible, it is undeniably awkward, and any solution that avoids it is-ceteris paribus-certainly to be preferred.22 On the hypothesis then that the ghost is the god's we make the following observations on the individual lines. Line 1: we accept the view that uppu here refers to a kind of drum.23 However, unless we are to assume a very abrupt transition, we must 19 So Lambert-Millard, 22, 152; von Soden, Or NS 38 (1969) 424, n. 1 ("das Schicksal sterben zu missen ") ; Bottero, art. cit. (n. 4), 119 (" une duree comparable h l'immortalite divine") ; Pettinato, art. cit. (n. 10), 79 (" la contingenza dell'essere umano "). 20 Lambert-Millard, "very perplexing"; Bottiro, " laconique et difficile." Why (so Pettinato) a ghost should be needed to remind man of the misery of his lot, and why the very fact of death does not suffice for this, is not clear. 21 KAR 307 (E. Ebeling, Tod und Leben, 28 ff.). The ghosts are of Enmesarra, Anu, Enlil, and Tiamat. The first is well known as an underworld deity. For Anu as a dead god, see perhaps Sumer 13 (1957) 117, pl. 25:14' ff.; according to CT 46, No. 43 perhaps Ninurta deposes Enlil. Note also the place of Anu and Enlil in Hittite god-lists among the old, deposed gods. 22 If the reading of line 227 in Lambert-Millard, 58, namely [. . . id-mu]-ril, is correct, then the prolepsis is clear. However, the traces by no means make 4 certain, and the only preserved reading is '-'e-e'-m[e] (K. 14967, Lambert-Millard, pl. 5), "she (the birth-goddess) had the uppu heard for all days to come," which may mean no more than that by her action she provided for this. 23 Uppu in the sense of " hole, pit " probably occurs in Lambert-Millard, 84 vii 37 (see von Soden, Or NS 38 [1969] 430, and to the list of occurrences add Sc.heil. Revue d'Assyriologie 15 [1918] 179 vii 4, li-tu-ur up-pi-i'-'a). 54</page><page sequence="8">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research ask what in either of the first two strophes implies the use of a drum. To our knowledge there is no evidence associating the uppu-drum with the preparation of potter's clay, but its use in rites of lamentation would fit well with the death of the god.24 The allusion we suggest to the first strophe receives some confirmation from the way that the reference to time in " for all days to come " is reminiscent of " On the new moon . . ." Perhaps, too, as in the first strophe, we should see here an etiological interest, this time in the origins of the uppu-drum in the cult. Line 2: obviously something extraordinary is provided for here, but for what ? The verb badi is ambiguous, and Enki could be proposing either the very existence of a ghost (" let there be present "), an unusual place (" in the flesh of the god "), or the ghost's remaining in the body contrary to normal practice. Though any of these possibilities is com- patible with our overall understanding of the strophe, we opt for the last. We have already seen reasons for doubting that a dead god would not be thought to survive as a ghost, and the flesh of the god seems to have been introduced into the composition of man precisely to account for the existence of a ghost. Normally, too, ghosts did not remain in the corpse, but until proper burial roamed about and then went to the underworld. We thus understand the second line to be a special fiat required to keep the ghost within the god's flesh.25 Line 3: balta we refer to the god " while alive." If understood of man, as has been done so far, again the difficulty of a prolepsis arises in the narrative section. We also go our own way in considering the birth- goddess the subject of the verb. This is the only possibility consistent with our interpretation of balta. But there are other reasons, too. First, apparently this is the way the verb is understood in one Assyrian recen- sion.26 Second, an arbitrary sign like the sounding-drum requires a pro- clamation like that of Marduk in Enufma elid or of the girl in the Mari letter. Third, such a proclamation by the goddess would best explain how she can say later on (I 240 ff.), when as yet man is but an unformed mass of clay, that she has freed the gods of their toil and imposed it on man. If, when she says this, within this mass there is also present a ghost who because of her knows why he is there and exactly what man is for, her claim makes much better sense. Line 4: an explanation of the D-form musdi escapes us.27 In any case, the ghost remains after the god's death to insure that the knowledge communicated to him is preserved. 24 See G. Reisner, Sumerisch-babylonische Hymnen p. 47:14-15, and cf. balag ir.ra in line 6. 25 The lexical passage (CT 19, 36, S. 6:17, Nabnitu) that defines the formula for release of the breath of the dead as edipu a etemmi, "to blow away, (said) of a ghost," we do not consider sufficient evidence to postulate a belief that ghosts remained confined in the body until freed by the magic formula. 26 Referred to above, n. 22. In this manuscript the second line of the quatrain is omitted in the narrative section; an haplography occasioned by the repetition of etemmu libei is not likely, since in this case the third line should also have been dropped. Thus in this text the etemmu has not been mentioned when one comes to usdifiima. 27 This is the only context passage for mu~'i; the evidence of the lexical texts is equally ambiguous. We suspect a pluralic-D, but cannot prove it. 55</page><page sequence="9">Number 200 December, 1970 To sum up by way of paraphrase: In the future we should go on hearing the drum that will sound in the lamentation rites for the dead god. Accordingly, the ghost of the god is to stay behind in the flesh of the god. Explanation: the birth-goddess shall inform the god while he is still alive that the sounding-drum is to be his token, i. e. the drum is to be sounded as a memorial of his death and the story behind it. Then, the god's ghost is to remain to see that the token-the sound and its meaning-is not forgotten.-Thus shall the gods provide that man is kept ever-mindful of his purpose, and perhaps also warned of the possible consequences of rebellion.2S This exegesis, though in our opinion not without its merits, also has its problems. Our explanation of the uppu is not completely convincing, not even to us; the connection between the drum and the ghost seems somewhat artificial. Hence the attractiveness of Jacobsen's suggestion (oral communication): uppu is also to be understood metaphorically of the heart-this is the " drum " that will sound " for all days to come," as the ghost beats within.29 " But hark! My pulse like a soft drum / Beats my approach, tells thee I come" (Bishop Henry King, The Surrender). Another problem is the ghost as a source of knowledge. In our view, we are certainly to imagine him present in the original seven pairs of men as a kind of innate knowledge. But this knowledge articulated and communicated, what does he do then, except perhaps to beat within man's heart? Perhaps nothing, but then perhaps, too, the poet saw in the ghost within the explanation of an enigma-man's religious impulse, the inner urging he experienced to submit to the yoke of the gods and to satisfy their needs. Perhaps.30 28 B. Landsberger, Die Welt des Orients 3, 72, suggests that ittu in En. el. V serves as a warning as well as a memorial. 2 There is a part of the body called uppu (MSL IX 10:115, 37:58-59), but it seems to be somewhere in the intestinal tract. so To other problems in the text-the name of the god (223), the precise signifi- cance of the spitting (233-234), and the meaning of the verb ta-a8-ta-al-DA (242)-- we can contribute nothing.</page></plain_text>
