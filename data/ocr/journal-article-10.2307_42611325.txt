Stuttgart- Berlin-Köln, Verlag W. Kohlhammer, 1991. vm-330p. 23 X 15,5 In spite of doubts and questionings about the discipline of Old Testament theology, the genre has continued to flourish and to be productive. Among its recent products, Preuß's work is likely to prove one of the most solid and competent. A full evaluation is not possible at this stage, since only the first of two volumes has been published. Fortunately, however, a clear account of the structure of the whole is provided. The first chapter, entitled Standortsbe- stimmung , furnishes a brief history of the subject and discusses the possible approaches to be taken. Searching for a 'centre' around which Old Testament theology may suitably be arranged, Preuß arrives at the rather complex formula 'JHWHs erwählendes Geschichtshandeln an Israel zur Gemeinschaft mit seiner Welt, das zugleich ein dieses Volk (und die Völker) verpflichtendes Handeln ist' (29). Following this decision, the total structure of the book will have four great sections: I. An overview (§2) of the election passages of the OT, and following this a full discussion (§3) of the choosing of the people and the placing of them under obligation. II. Yahweh as subject of the electing action in history. This includes (§4): the names of God, his 'working powers' (spirit, face, angel, name etc.), his revelation (clearly treated as an uncertain subject, and so marked in inverted commas: 'The OT knows no concept of revelation, certainly not a sole or fixed one' - p. 229), God as creator, and the question of utterances about the 'being' or 'essence' of God, including eternity, holiness, jealousy, the living God, and anthropomorphism. §5 is entitled 'God's world and the world far from God', and here we find the dwelling-places of YHWH, the ark, the tent of meeting, groups like the cherubs and seraphs, demons, Satan, and the underworld - perhaps a somewhat incongruous group.</page><page sequence="2">270 Recensiones The second volume will include: III. The outworking of the original election and the further thinking out of it: the further objects of the electing action of YHWH in history. This will include treatment of such subjects as: the patriarchal narratives, kingdom, temple, priesthood, and prophets. IV. Results and implications of the experienced historical election. Here we will find 'The Israelite and his relation to God' (anthropology), the life of the chosen (basic questions of ethos and ethic), the divine service of Israel (cult), the future of the people of God (future expectations, eschatology, apocalyptic) and ' the chosen people of God and the nations ' Obviously we cannot comment on the contents of the second volume, but this mention of its outline will enable the reader to understand the design of the entire work. In this first volume, then, the reader will find sections on such substantial themes as: Israel as people and community of faith; the Decalogue; the land of Israel; Yahweh as warrior; the names of God, his operative powers; revelation, creation; utterances about the 'being' of Yahweh. The final chapter §5, as indicated above, has a slightly odd progression. Does God's dwelling-place belong in the same section with Satan and the demons? The ark might have gone with the (earlier) section on war, the realm of the dead might have fitted with eschatology, which is to be in the next volume. Such difficulties, however, can scarcely be avoided, for they probably belong to the nature of the enterprise of Old Testament theology, or at least to this form of it. Basically Preuß's book seems to be an affirmation and continuation of that classic line which began with Eichrodt. One hears an echo of that earlier scholar in the first paragraph, where the purpose is defined as the attempt to offer 'eine Zusammenschau der Glaubens- und Zeugniswelt des AT'. Although difficulties in this approach have been seen - and especially by von Rad, whose arguments are carefully discussed here - all later experience suggests that the line taken by Eichrodt, and here followed by Preuß, is the most practical approach to be seen thus far. Some recent proposals looking in a more 'canonical' direction (he mentions Clements, Childs, Martens, Goldingay, Rendtorff) are discussed (19-23) but seem to be considered as being too vague so far. Less attention or none at all, on the other hand, is given to those who think that the whole project of an Old Testament theology is conceptually incoherent, is inherently anti- Jewish (Levenson), is theologically undesirable, or else is simply impossible to put into practice. Preuß writes with great competence, with a fine attention to the literature (especially the more recent work, and including much non- German publication). He has a comprehensive exegetical and theological sense. As compared with some earlier theologies, we see the value of adjustment in view of recent research and changes in critical opinions. The work is dense and rich in information. Though it is expressly designed as an introductory study, the student who has mastered all this material will have a good knowledge of what the Old Testament is all</page><page sequence="3">Recensiones 271 about. One thing that makes it so concentrated is the author's principle that biblical passages are not to be quoted verbally but cited only by chapter and verse. To find what the passages say, the reader must look them up. The principle is understandable but, since a very large number of passages are cited, the effect is that some pages are heavily weighed down with figures: for example, p. 61, by my count, cites the numbers for over forty passages, p. 135 cites something well over sixty depending on one's mode of counting. Readers are supposed to look these all up individually, but will they do so? Naturally, readers will differ over many details: that is only to be expected. One example: it is misleading, even on the ground of the example of Nabal, to maintain (159) that 'the name [of a person] is an expression of [his or her] essence'. And over the balance of the whole one cannot judge until the second volume has appeared. But in general this is a learned and thoughtful contribution, well written, and one that will stand in the front rank of Old Testament theologies. There are, indeed, more general questions about the whole idea of Old Testament theology, but these questions take one very far afield, and Preuß was probably right in deciding to go ahead with his own plan and the result is a substantial justification of his decision.
