<plain_text><page sequence="1">Looking and learning: Upper Palaeolithic Art and information gathering Steven J. Mithen Introduction The study of Upper Palaeolithic art has been advanced in recent years by considering how it may have aided the Late Pleistocene hunter gatherers adapt to their environment (e.g. Conkey 1978; Gamble 1982; Pfeiffer 1982; Jochim 1983). Much of this work has been concerned with the art as a medium for the transmission or storage of information. However, the term 'information' is often poorly defined and it is rare for any contact to be made between theoretical argument and the specific imagery in the paintings, engravings and sculpture. In this paper I will contribute to this functional analysis of the art by defining information as knowledge about the location and state of potential resources and describe how the imagery often relates to the methods that modern foragers use to acquire such information. The gathering of information from the natural environment is an activity in which all modern hunter gatherers engage. Many aspects of the environment are monitored in detail including the weather, ground conditions, and the presence or absence of particular species. From these, inferences are made as to the location and characteristics of game and plants. I will focus on three components of information gathering behaviour which I will show to be represented in the art. First, the use of tracks and signs left by either potential prey or other animals. These include footprints, scats (faeces), marks left on the ground from resting or rolling and marks left on, or in, vegetation. To these visual signs may be added any audible signs, such as from animals calling or moving. Second, the detailed observations of individual animals or herds that are made once these have been located. From such observations hunters select the animals of particular ages, size, sex or state of health which they will attempt to kill. Finally I will consider the use of animals as cues to future environmental events or the location of potential resources. Once information has been collected in this manner, it will either be used directly, initiating a stalk or attempted kill, or stored and exchanged with other hunters. Such information is often exchanged between the sexes. Since men and women frequently engage in different activities (hunting and plant gathering respectively) they often forage in different areas. However they remain alert to signs of plants or animals which may be of use to the other sex. At the camp the women will tell the men about any tracks or game signs they have seen and the men inform the women concerning available plant World Archaeology Volume 19 No. 3 New Directions in Palaeolithic Archaeology ?

Due to the ubiquity of information gathering there can be little doubt that this was used by the Upper Palaeolithic hunter gatherers. My aim is to demonstrate that a record of such activity is present in their art and to do this I will briefly describe a set of images relating to different aspects of information gathering behaviour. I will follow this by briefly considering the implications of this theme for general explanations of Upper Palaeolithic art. Information gathering from tracks, trails and signs Tracks and hoofprints The ethnographic literature has many references to hunter gatherers searching for and being alert to the footprints of their prey (eg. Draper 1976: 216-17; Horne and Aston 1924: 28; Goodale 1971: 61; Sullivan 1942: 44, 77, 95, 109; Nelson 1983: 104; Hassrick 1964: 193; Gould 1980: 13; Winterhalder 1981: 90; Esticko-Griffen 1986: 38). The information that can be gathered from a track print or trail includes the age, sex and health of its maker, its direction and speed of travel and the time since it was made. From these, inferences can be drawn as to the present location of an animal whose characteristics can be determined in some detail (see Silberauer 1981: 210-11; Lee 1979: 11-13; Sullivan 1942: 44-5). In northern regions the ability to catch game is often dependent upon the state of snow cover since this determines the ease with which tracks can be found and followed (eg. Tanner 1979: 51-2). There are many references in Upper Palaeolithic art to animal tracks and prints, some easily recognised and some requiring the interpretation of 'abstract' marks. As an aid to the discussion Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the prints of the major ungulates of the late pleistocene. Guthrie (1984) has proposed that the 'twisted perspective' convention found in many paintings and engravings which involves twisting the feet and horns/antlers of an animal to a ventral view while the rest of the animal is seen laterally, is partly explained by the importance of tracks in a hunter's daily life. As he states 'The feet are actually drawn as one normally sees them in tracks when they become an important distinguishing character. Bear feet have five digits, artiodactyl feet are cloven, horses have single hooves, rhino three etc. This distinctive trait disappears when drawn from a side view' (1984: 58). This is not to argue that detailed anatomically perfect depictions of prints are being made simply that the principle defining characteristics of a species foot prints are represented. One of the most startling images to illustrate this is shown in Figure 2, an engraving from Lascaux. In this we not only see the feet of a horse drawn as circular hoofprints but find these contrasted with those of a cow which are similarly drawn as prints, not hooves. This applies to the majority of horses, cervids and bison in Lascaux. Figure 3 illustrates the bovid feet in the cave and we see that, when they are drawn as opposed to being omitted altogether, the style makes allusion to a hoof track. A similar argument can be made for the bison on the Altamira ceiling.</page><page sequence="3">Looking and learning: Upper Palaeolithic art and information gathering 299 a D f S\.

Some images which have been previously termed abstract marks in Palaeolithic art are in fact representations of track prints. For instance Figure 4 illustrates one particular type of 'dented circle' sign described by Lorblanchet (1977). This symbol is found throughout the Franco Cantabrian region. Figures 4a-4g are examples of this sign while Figure 4h is the track print of a reindeer on snow or ice. That the similarity is not simply fortuitous can be seen in Figure 5, part of an engraving from Les Trois Freres, where we find this symbol directly associated with a reindeer. Similar examples of an 'abstract' sign resembling the track print of an animal with which it is found exist for both bison and horse. For instance Figure 6 illustrates two engraved bison from Font De Gaume both having a double semi circle sign on their bodies. This symbol is the essence of a bison hoof print. Similarly we find a painted panel from the cave of La Pileta which includes the depiction of a horse with a circular sign 11</page><page sequence="4">300 Steven J.

This sign, a further example of which exists at Tito Bustillo, bears a striking similarity to the print of an unshod horse. The representation of tracks in Upper Palaeolithic art may in fact be quite common since the occurrence of long lines of dots in caves, such as Niaux and El Castillo, may be the depictions of trails left by animals. The sight of such paintings bears striking resemblances to the tracks of animals across snow, for instance compare Figures 8a and 8b. This argument can be supported by the impressions made in the mud at the cave of Fontanet. As illustrated in Figure 9 we see the right footprint of a man had been made but the left represented by a series of finger marks in the clay, demonstrating an association, in this case at least, between footprints and dots. A final example of footprint imagery in Upper Palaeolithic example is that in the 'inscription' from La Pasiega, Figure 10. We see here an image which it is difficult to refute as being anything other than a footprint. Faeces On a par with tracks hunters can use the faeces or scats of their prey to make inferences regarding their location and characteristics. As with tracks the ethnographic literature has many references to the inspection of faeces to such ends (eg. Marks 1976: 117; Sullivan 1942: 71; Lee 1976: 212-13; Blurton-Jones and Konner 1976: 343; Silberauer 1981: 271; Hill and Hawkes 1983: 152). To these may be added the descriptions of naturalists such as Ernest Seton (1925) and of modern ecologists concerned with the relationship between the density of a species droppings and its population size (eg. Bennet et al. 1940) or between faecal pellet weight and body size (eg. Coe and Carr 1983).</page><page sequence="6">a ~o 7/' -- Figure 5 J/"/ \ Figure 7 / i' Figure 6 Figure 9 w C-n "t, rlx / / '-- ~d~md ': ', ,&gt;uzre8 $ , $ * &lt;i or I ,~~~--a t ---, t Fi Figure 10 Figure 11</page><page sequence="7">Looking and learning: Upper Palaeolithic art and information gathering 303 Camps (1984) has drawn attention to the presence of imagery in Upper Palaeolithic art relating to defecation. Although she states one can rarely find unambiguous painted examples she describes several for which this interpretation is difficult to refute. These typically depict an animal with its tail raised, in the posture of defecation, and with dots or lines representing the excretion of faecal pellets in the appropriate place. Her examples include ibex from Cougnac, horse from Santimamine and rhino from Lascaux, Figure 11. In addition to these mural images there are several mobiliary works which depict animals defecating. The most important examples are the Magdalenian spearthrowers from Pyrennean sites which are most sensitively carved to show a young ibex excreting an oversized turd, Figure 12. The repetition of this image, there are possibly as many as 20 examples (Pfeiffer 1982), and their distribution over a large area has been frequently commented upon as providing evidence for either an individual or a school of craftsmen and trade links or settlement patterns. The theme itself has received less attention other than being evidence for a palaeolithic sense of humour. Certain engravings also provide examples of animals defecating such as one from the cave of Labastide, Figure 13a, appearing to depict a bison in the process of defecating and from Levanzo in Italy, Figure 13b, of a cervid excreting. Other mobiliary pieces are of equal importance. An engraved bone from Laugerie Basse, Figure 14, has been simply described as a man following a bison. However the erect tail of the bison above certain marks which the little man is inspecting closely suggests that the image represents an information gathering scene using bison scats. The engraving from Les Trois Freres referred to above, Figure 5, might also be seen as an information gathering scene. As well as the reindeer print the young bison appears to be excreting and the shamen, or possibly disguised hunter, related to these images. If these above images are accepted as evidence for a defecation theme in Upper Palaeolithic art then this interpretation may be used for more ambiguous examples. For instance the raised tail posture is common in many paintings and engravings, Figure 15, and a high proportion of these may be images of defecation. An alternative interpretation is that it depicts an animal inviting copulation. This may be largely discounted due to the presence of male animals with raised tails and the general lack of imagery showing animals engaged in mating behaviour (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967). Certain images are painted or engraved with either highly detailed or exaggerated anuses. For instance certain mammoths at Pech Merle have their anuses and anal flaps Figure 5 Detail of engraving from Les Trois Frere. After Laming-Emperaire 1962.

This again may relate to a concern with the act and results of defecation by the Upper Palaeolithic hunters. Marks on the ground (other than tracks) The ethnographic literature has a certain number of references to hunter gatherers searching for, recognising and making inferences from the marks left by animals after they have been lying on the ground (eg. Sullivan 1942: 71; Bion-Griffen 1984: 108; Nelson 1973: 91, 1983: 176; Meehan 1982: 83). The clearest examples in Upper Palaeolithic art of animals rolling or lying on the ground are the bison from the Altamira ceiling and from El Castillo, Figures 16a, 16b and 17. These images, in which we see bison curled up on the ground, have been previously interpreted as animals dying or giving birth. However bison simply roll on the ground to cover themselves with mud as protection against insects and possibly to mark territory leaving behind characteristics marks as shown in Figure 18a. This appears to be what is being depicted in these images - bison engaged in activity which leave signs of their presence. Other images of bison wallowing exist such as the engraving from Laugerie- Basse, Figure 18b. Prior to wallowing bison sometimes tear up the ground with their horns as shown in Figure 19a and their stance bears a striking resemblance to an engraving from Le Gabillou, traditionally interpreted as a bison charging, Figure 19b. This type of analysis also applies to certain of the images in Lascaux. The 'jumping' cow, Figure 20a, is more plausibly seen as a cow rolling on its side. Similarly the 'falling' horse, Figure 20b, is likely to be a representation of a horse rolling on its back. It is a characteristic difference between horses and bovids that only the former roll right over onto their backs. A further example from Lascaux depicts a horse rolling on its side, Figure 20c. Cervids are depicted lying down or wallowing. For instance a carved bone disc from Laugerie-Basse, Figure 21a shows a young deer lying down. The image of a red deer on a plaquette from Gourdon bears a close similarity to that of a red deer wallowing, Figures 21b and 21c. Marks left on vegetation Another class of signs left in the environment which hunter gatherers utilise as a source of information are those on vegetation. There are three types of these: those from the eating of leaves, bark or shoots, those from scratching on bark with either teeth claws or antlers/horns and those from movement through vegetation. There are numerous references in the ethnographic literature to hunter gatherers searching for and using such signs (eg. Nelson 1983: 175-6; Marshall 1976: 111; Goodale 1971: 161; McBryde 1978: 249; Bion-Griffen 1984: 108; Jennes 1955: 55; Lee 1976: 213; Hill and Hawkes 1983: 150). In Upper Palaeolithic art we find several images of animals nibbling what appears to be vegetation. The most notable of these is the image on a spatula from La Vache, Figure 22a, showing a bovid nibbling leaves and a hind associated with vegetation like marks.</page><page sequence="10">Figure 14 306 Steven J.

The Saami reindeer hunters examine the state of lichen and grass to determine where reindeer have been grazing and this source of information may relate to depictions of a reindeer grazing found in Upper Palaeolithic art, Figures 23a-c. Several images from Lascaux may be seen as depictions of animals moving through vegetation and hence breaking twigs and brushing aside grass leaving a record of their movement. By interpreting the 'abstract' marks as vegetation instead of arrows, a bull, Figure 24a, and a horse, Figure 24b, from the diverticule axial in Lascaux provide examples of this theme. Both of these animals also have their feet depicted as hoof prints rather than hooves. With other images it is not immediately clear that the animals are associated with vegetation but I would argue that many of the frequent associations between animals and 'abstract' marks relates to the signs they leave on vegetation. For instance a bone from Massat has the image of a bear's head next to a feather like sign, Figure 25a, and bears leave a variety of marks on trees, as illustrated in Figure 25b. It can be noted here that the marks left on vegetation by animals often have distinctive shapes. For instance Figure 26a shows the scratchings from deer antler and Figure 26b the marks left by red deer after they have been chewing bark. Imagery such as claviform symbols may be related to such marks. Sounds Hunter Gatherers not only use their eyes to gather information but also their noses and ears (eg. Yost and Kelley 1983: 194-6; Silberauer 1981: 209; Tanner 1979: 44; Nelson 1973: 91, 1983: 13; Estiko-Griffen 1986: 38; Blurton-Jones and Konner 1976: 330). The calls made by large ungulates contain considerable amounts of information about themselves and the animals around them, in addition to signalling their own presence. For instance the call of a red deer stag during the rut varies according to the age, size and status of the animal, the size of his harem, and the particular stage of the rut (Bouchner 1982). Clutton-Brock and Albon (1979) have argued that red deer roaring functions to Figure 14 Engraved bone from Laugerie-Basse. After Graziosi 1960. Figure 15 Tail-up display in cave paintings.

It is a form of 'honest advertisement' about their strength in a potential contest for a harem of hinds. Challenges to a harem holding stag rarely attack after having been out-roared, and if they do they very rarely win. My point is that such advertisement can equally apply to hunters who can use the nature of roaring as a further means to assess a stag's presence and quality. We find many depictions of red deer bellowing in both parietal and mobiliary art. These include wall engravings, Figures 27a and 27b, paintings, Figure 31a, and examples on mobile pieces, the most notable of which is the spear thrower from Les Horteaux, Figure 27c. Other animals are shown calling or bellowing and such sounds no doubt contain information similar to that of red deer. For instance there is a carved neighing horse from Mas d'Azil, Figure 28a and two examples of bellowing bison from Altamira, Figures 17 and 28b. Information from the sight of animals The ethnographic literature demonstrates that in many cases hunters are very selective as to the particular animals they attempt to kill once a herd has been located. The hunter makes observations on the herd to select animals of particular ages, sex, size, and states of health to attempt to kill. Situational factors such as wind direction are taken into account when making such decisions (Silberauer 1981: 67; Nelson 1983: 165; Gubser 1965: 165; Marks 1976: 105). One feature of the animal's anatomy to which the hunter will direct his attention is the antler or horn. These provide information as to the sex, age and state of health of any particular animal due to characteristic patterns of growth and development. For instance Figure 29 illustrates the growth pattern of red deer antler. If the animal is not in prime health the antler/horn will be one of the first features to indicate this to an observer (Guthrie 1984). A further reason for concentrating attention on the antlers of possible prey is the extensive use Palaeolithic hunters made of this raw material for tools. In addition to using the antlers as clues to an animal's age and health they will also be assessed for their own intrinsic value. Consequently one of the anatomical features on which a hunter will focus his attention while watching animals are the antlers or horns. The importance of information gathering from antler/horn is reflected in Upper Figure 19 a Bison tearing up the ground with its horn. After Murie 1954. b 'Charging' Bison from Pech Merle.

First, in many paintings and engravings antlers/horns are drawn face on rather than in profile as is the body of the animal, joining the treatment of hooves as a second aspect of the 'twisted perspective' stylistic trait. Figures 30a-d give typical examples of this widespread feature for red deer, bison and ibex. It is evident that such frontal view of the antler/horn provides more information to an observer than a sideways view. As with the stylised hooves however, this is not to argue that the artists were attempting anatomically perfect depictions, simply that the imagery reflects a hunter's interest when observing one or more animals. A second feature of the art which relates to this observational activity is the frequent exaggeration of the size of the antlers/horns in the pictures. By this means the artist draws attention to such an important part of the anatomy. Lascaux provides several notable examples. Figures 30d and 31a illustrate the use of this technique in the depiction of red deer while Figure 31b shows its use for ibex in Lascaux. This last example is interesting since the set of engraved, and originally painted, heads are depicted without their bodies similar to a series of red deer heads, Figure 31c, near to them within the cave. These red deer have been interpreted as either swimming or lying in long grass (Hooper 1980). I would suggest that they are drawn simply without their bodies so that attention is focused on the necks, heads and antlers, in the same manner as the ibex heads. The thickness and posture of the neck provides a further clue to an animal's age (Bouchner 1982). This method of omitting parts of the body to draw attention to others is sometimes taken to an extreme in the case of antlers, such as in examples from La Mairie a Teyjat, Figure 32a, Le Portel, Figures 32b-c, and Niaux, Figure 32d. The use of antler and horn supplement observations made on the body of the animal itself to asses its size, weight and age. Such assessments are most easily made when viewing the animal in profile, as the vast majority of Upper Palaeolithic images are drawn. One aspect of body form of particular interest to hunters is fat content. Jochim (1976) has discussed the importance which hunters attach to the fat in an animal and the role this plays in decisions as to which animal to kill. In light of this it is not surprising that the fatty tissues of large mammals in the art are often depicted as being very large, as both Guthrie (1984) and Baffier (1984) have recently noted. Guthrie assumes that the exaggerated fat areas are true representations of the animals demonstrating the richness of the Late Glacial environment. However, the tundral conditions and the use of exaggeration elsewhere in the art suggest that this is not so and the artists are again emphasising a part of the animals anatomy to which a hunter's attention must be drawn when gathering information to decide upon a kill. In general, many parts of bodies, or whole bodies, are depicted mis-shapen, out of proportion or are simply omitted all together, e.g. Figures 28b, 31a, 30c, 33a-c.

Mithen clearly deliberate and planned imagery functions to stress one part of the body, or the animal's activity, rather than another or the whole since it is these which are of interest when gathering information while watching game. A final intriguing example concerns the engraved fish from Pindal, Figure 34a. This is often interpreted as a Tunny due to its long forked tail but Leroi-Gourhan (1968) argued that it is a 'salmon or trout masquerading as a tunny'. He suggested that when the forked tail is removed we are left with a fish that is "indisputably' a salmon or trout due to the nature of the fins and the very close similarities with other salmon/trout depictions. An explanation for the extremely forked tail can be found in that a distinguishing characteristic between sea trout and the salmon is that the tail of the former is square or slightly convex, Figure 34b while the salmon's tail is slightly forked, Figure 34c. A modern fisherman's claim is that 'if you can pick up a sea trout by its tail, it is a salmon!' (Chandler 1979). Consequently we have in the Pindal image the use of exaggeration to draw attention to this distinguishing feature of the fishes' anatomy. Animals as cues Observations made on the visual characteristics of an animal may be considered as cues to the returns that may be gained from killing that animal. A second manner in which observations made on animals act as cues is when the type of species observed has a direct relationship with another and hence provides information about that species, rather than itself. That foragers are aware of connections between particular animal species and the food plants on which they feed and use for shelter is frequently commented upon in the ethnographic literature (eg. Yost and Kelly 1983: 194-6; Silberaurer 1981: 94; Brent and Brent 1983). This is often used to locate particular animals by travelling to the areas of preferred food or shelter (eg. Winterhalder 1981: 79; Opler 1941: 326) or using the activity of the animal as a cue to a hidden plant food (eg. Marshall 1976: 111). Such relationships of ecological significance play an important role when animal species act as cues to other animals. Marks (1976: 116) described how the Valley Bisa watch for the morning flights of Oxpeckers and Cattle Egrets since these act as cues to Figure 32 a Reindeer antler imagery from La Mairie a Teyjat.

Mithen the location of buffalo on whose backs they forage for grubs. In a similar manner the Aborigines who exploited the Bogong moths watched for the aggregation of crows which also fed upon the moths and hence provided a cue to their location (Flood 1980: 66). In certain cases it is evident that the hunter gatherers are aware of, discuss and use predator prey relationships. For instance Gubser (1965: 274) relates how the Nunamiut are aware of relationships between foxes and lemmings and how a high density of one correlates with that of the other. Similarly Nelson (1983: 212-13) relates how the Koyukon use the density of mouse tracks as a cue to the density of fur bearing carnivores and are aware of density relationships between rodents such as voles and lemmings and small carnivores such as weasels, mink and fox. Blurton-Jones and Konner (1976: 341) refer to the practical value the !Kung gain from their detailed knowledge of the hunting behaviour of competing predators. In the light of this knowledge and cue use by modern foragers the frequent association between carnivore and herbivores in Upper Palaeolithic art may be interpreted as a further example of imagery relating to information gathering. That is, such depictions relate to the use Upper Palaeolithic hunters made of observations on the presence and behaviour of their competing carnivores to infer the state of the large herbivores they jointly exploited such as their location, the size and age sex structure of the herd and the availability of carcasses. One of the most telling images is from Altexeri which depicts a reindeer with a wolf engraved upon its shoulder, Figure 35a. This is particularly interesting since this cave is in the Basque region where reindeer would have been at the limit of their range hence possibly particularly susceptible to wolf predation. Elsewhere I have explored the effect of wolf predation on reindeer yields using simulation and demonstrated that knowledge of wolf-reindeer interactions would have been significant for the Upper Palaeolithic hunters when making subsistent-settlement decisions (Mithen 1986). A second wolf- herbivore association is from Altamira in which a wolf is depicted on the flank of a bison, Figure 35b. Further associations between carnivores and herbivores in Upper Palaeo- lithic art are illustrated in Figure 36a-e. Of these Figure 36e is particularly notable since it shows an otter and a salmon/trout indicating that this ecological knowledge possessed and used by the hunters extended to aquatic communities. Certain images refer to predator-prey relations by depicting carnivores either actively hunting their prey or associated with a herd of animals. For instance an image from Font de Gaume shows a lion about to leap onto horses and a mobiliary carving from Lorthet depicts a wolf in Figure 36 a Feline and horse from Niaux.

Mithen pursuit of a cervid, Figures 37a, b. The illustrations in Figure 37c-f provide further examples of this association between carnivores and herbivores. Further images are rather ambiguous but may be of equal significance. For instance an engraving from Les Combarelles is often described as two felines following each other with one having a mane, Figure 38. However, a more plausible interpretation due to the lack of other felines with manes is that the first figure is a juvenile bison which is being associated with a lion since there is a predator-prey relationship between these. Two further images can be described which may also relate to such depiction of species between which there is a direct relationship and hence may act as cues to each other. These concern the association between birds and herbivores. As Marks (1976) noted the flights of birds which prey on parasites on the backs of large mammals may act as cues to the location of these mammals. In light of this an engraving from Puy de Lac is interesting since this appears to associate a bird with a bison, Figure 39a. Similarly one from Lourdes associates a bird, possibly a crow, with a horse, Figure 39b. These may therefore be further examples of this type of information gathering/cue use imagery. A third type of cue used by modern foragers is when there is an indirect association between the observed species and the one about which information is inferred. These often arise due to both species reacting to a third variable directly affecting both of them, such as air temperature. The calander plants used by the Aborigines (Campbell 1972, Leavitt 1981) provide the most detailed descriptions of such cue use. It is frequently the case that such cues involve future weather conditions (eg. Leavitt 1981: 12-13; Nelson 1983: 13, 59, 63, 64, 78; De Lagune 1972: 804). Certain images from Upper Palaeolithic art may be interpreted as relating to the use of such indirect cues since they depict several animals all of which are engaged in activity that is particular to one season. Hence observation of one of these by the Upper Palaeolithic hunters would be acting as a cue to another. Marschack (1972) has identified such seasonal imagery in the art, although many of his interpretations must be taken with care. Two examples illustrate the presence of such imagery and how this may relate to the use of indirect cues and information gathering. First we might consider the Montgaudier baton, Figure 40a. Marschack (1972) interprets all the images on this as relating to early spring. The fish is identified as a male salmon at the time of spawning due to the 'kype' or hook, on its lower jaw. The seals, which are predators of salmon, may be following the salmon up the rivers or relate to the gathering of seals at estuaries and coasts at this time of year. The snakes/eels, one of which is clearly a male, emerge from hibernation at this time and form breeding pairs. Marschack also goes on to interpret the minor images on the baton as figures such as flower buds. Consequently he claims that the depiction on this baton is of a set of images all relating to early spring. From the information gathering perspective this represents the association of animals each of which may act as a cue to the other since they are reacting to the same environmental changes. For instance the sight of spawning salmon or emerged snakes will act as a cue to the aggregation of seals. A second example is equally interesting. This is the depiction of deer and salmon on a baton from Lortet, Figure 40b. On this three deer are engraved, two of which are stags, crossing a river in which salmon are leaping. There are two diamond shaped marks above one of the deer which are not easily interpreted. Marschack (1972) suggests that this is</page><page sequence="23">Looking and learning: Upper Palaeolithic art and information gathering 319 Figure 38 a b 0 jllll 0 N -', p a b Figure 40 Figure 38 Engraving from les Combarelles.

Mithen either an image of autumn, when the salmons runs are largest and the stags collect their harems, or summer when the stags depart from the hinds. Whichever it may be, this is an association of the movement of deer with the jumping of salmon. Observation of one of these may act as an indirect cue to the other. A further example of imagery relating to indirect cue use may be the representation of birds in general. Lorblanchet (1974) has described how the majority of the bird images which can be identified in Upper Palaeolithic art are of waterfowl such as ducks, geese and cranes. Many of these may be migratory species. In contrast, the predominant species in the faunal assemblages are of game birds. Some examples of bird imagery in parietal art are illustrated in Figure 41a-e, and mobiliary art in Figure 42a-e. One explanation for the preference for depicting waterfowl may be that it is these species that act as cues for environmental events, that is, this is a further example of the information gathering theme. Support for this can be found in the ethnographic literature. For instance Nelson (1983: 78) describes how the first arrival of migratory birds is one of the most noteworthy events for the Koyukon and that no other is waited with greater pleasure. One reason for this is that the arrival of the birds mark the end of the winter season, that is they act as a cue to imminent environmental changes. Similarly the Koyukon watch for migrating waterfowl during the late autumn since 'when long ribbons of swans as noisily high in the cold fall rain Koyukon people say that freeze up will come very soon afterwards' (Nelson 1983: 90). Sullivan (1942) has described how the T'ena are glad when the ducks return in the spring since this coincides with the thaw. Consequently the ethnographic literature suggests that migratory waterfowl act as important cues to changing environmental conditions and this, being consistent with the other features of information gathering imagery I have described, may be the principle reason why it is these species which are primarily depicted in the art. Information, attention and cognitive development By describing these images and relating them to the methods that modern hunter gatherers use to gather information from the natural environment I have identified a theme of information gathering in Upper Palaeolithic art. This has important implications for general explanations of the art. For instance the 'arts for art's sake' Figure 41 Examples of bird imagery in Parietal Art a Grotte de Ganties-Montespan.

Mithen explanation, recently resurrected by Halverson (1987) is ineffective in explaining such patterning, though the recognition of this theme does not deny purely aesthetic qualities to the art. Theories such as 'hunting magic' might be reformulated as 'information gathering magic', though many of the weaknesses with such interpretations may remain. However, I wish to briefly consider the implications of identifying this theme for the interpretation of the art as being related to education of children, as discussed by Pfeiffer (1982). Pfeiffer (1982) argued that the art may play a significant role in the education and development of young members of the Upper Palaeolithic groups. He suggested that music, song and dance were involved as the children, often in states of fright viewed the art and heard the related myths, their heightened emotional states helping to imprint the crucial survival information contained in the myths into their memories. This idea, which Pfeiffer did not support with aspects of the imagery itself, is interesting in light of the information gathering theme I have identified. One crucial aspect of cognitive development in young children is a shift in the mode of obtaining information from the environment. Wright and Vlieststra (1975) have discussed this in greatest detail distinguishing between 'exploratory' and 'search' behaviour. The former is essentially spontaneous and motivated by curiosity while search behaviour is goal orientated and organized. It serves to fulfil a plan by attending to stimuli which are relevant and possibly informative for the task at hand. Children use only exploratory behaviour while adults supplement this with searching, selectively attending to particular stimuli in preference to others. Upper Palaeolithic art may be related to the cognitive development of the use of 'search' behaviour. Together with the related song, dance and myth discussed by Pfeiffer (1982) the art controls the development of search behaviour and selective attention by specifying which particular aspects of animal behaviour and form should be attended to if relevant information is to be gathered. This role of the art is in contrast to that proposed by Pfeiffer. He argued that the children learnt fixed information about the environment to use in later life whereas this argument proposes that they were learning how to gather that information to then utilise in decision making. In effect, the children were learning how to learn. From this view the images may be seen as mnemonic aids to the teachers as to which aspects of animal form and behaviour to draw the 'students' attention to. Conclusion I have argued that one theme in Upper Palaeolithic art concerns information gathering from the natural environment. Animals are depicted engaged in activities and by using stylistic conventions which relate to the signs they leave and their own physical characteristics to which a hunter will focus his/her attention when gathering information. The examples given provide only a very small sample of the total imagery but bring several facets of the art together into one coherent framework. These include the 'twisted perspective' trait, some of the 'abstract' signs, the postures of the animals, the activities in which they are depicted and the presence of distortion and omission. In addition the information gathering theme helps explain the frequent association of</page><page sequence="27">Looking and learning: Upper Palaeolithic art and information gathering 323 carnivores and herbivores, the presence of seasonal imagery and the predominance of migratory wildfowl in the bird imagery since all of these concern the use of animal as cues. Negative evidence is also significant. Both Ucko and Rosenfeld (1967) and Guthrie (1984) have commented upon what is 'missing' from Upper Palaeolithic imagery. For instance there are few images of young animals, small mammals and of sexual behaviour - subjects of little consequence for information gathering about large game. An explanation for this information gathering theme is found by considering the art's role in education and the cognitive development of young children. In particular the emergence of 'search' behaviour and 'selective attention' appear to be related to the art. I have argued that the imagery partly controls the course of such developments. In this light the art suggests that the Upper Palaeolithic hunters had some forms of 'meta- cognitive' knowledge, i.e. knowledge about their own methods of perception and memory. As Ucko and Rosenfeld (1967) stressed it is important to recognise the stylistic diversity within Upper Palaeolithic art as well as the overall unity in content and technique. Any attempt to provide one all-encompassing explanation for parietal and mobile paintings, engravings, bas-relief and sculpture produced over a 20,000 year period is hopelessly optimistic and will inevitably be flawed. However what can be done is to identify themes each of which may help to explain a significant proportion of the imagery and which are not mutually exclusive. The information gathering theme I have discussed here is perhaps just one of many, in a complex but magnificent artistic tradition.

Looking and learning: upper palaeolithic art and information gathering The paper identifies a theme in Upper Palaeolithic art of information gathering. It demonstrates that a significant number of images relate to the activity of information gathering from the natural environment about the location and state of large game. To do this, it describes some of the information gathering methods used by modern foragers, such as using tracks and trails, and then shows how the subject and stylistic traits of certain images relate to such methods. Having established this theme, the paper considers its implications for general explanations of Upper Palaeolithic art.</page></plain_text>
