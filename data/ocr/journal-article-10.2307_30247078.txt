HAMMACK ARIZONA STATE MUSEUM ABSTRACT In July 1966 under a contract with the Arizona Highway Depart- ment and the Bureau of Public Roads the Arizona State Museum in cooperation with the Museum of Northern Arizona conducted salvage excavations on two sites on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation near Forestdale, Arizona. Two phases of occupation were represented at one of the ruins investigated, the Skiddy Canyon Ruin. A kiva, pithouse and a number of burials show cultural affiliation with the Forestdale Phase dated between A.D. 600 and 800. A series of rectangular masonry rooms, a trash area, and burials were characteristic of the Linden Phase which has been dated provisionally between A.D. 1100 and 1200. A second site excavated, the Gobbler Tank site, is a small Linden Phase seasonal unit. Excavation of these sites has enabled a preliminary description of the Linden Phase in the Forestdale region. INTRODUCTION During the summer of 1966 the Arizona State Museum, Tucson, and the Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff, under- took a joint archaeological salvage program in the Forestdale Valley on the Fort Apache Reservation, eastern Arizona. Two sites were excavated as a result of the projected widening of U. S. Highway 60 (Arizona Highway Department Project F-026-1 /17/) eight miles southwest of Show Low, Arizona. Field work under the direction of the author began on July 18 and terminated on August 15. Labor was recruited on the Fort Apache Reservation and utilized to the extent of 100 man days. The excavation of these two sites resumes archaeological examination of the prehistoric remains in the Forestdale Valley. Emil W.

P: 16:1, and a section of a small pueblo, Ariz. P:16:2. From 1941 to 1944 work was concentrated on the Bluff Site, Ariz. P: 16:20, the earliest dated pottery-bearing Mogollon site excavated to date. Excavations of later period sites at this time remain unpublished. With the information recovered from these excavations Haury and Sayles (1947) set up chronolog- ical phases for the region (Fig. 1). Beginning with the Hilltop Phase, dated in the early A.D. 300's by tree rings at the Bluff Site, eight additional phases were postulated. This sequence ended with the Canyon Creek Phase after A.D. 1300, the last prehistoric occupation in the area. Only the first four of these phases have published descriptions. The recent highway salvage excavations have provided information on the Linden Phase, A.D. 1100-1200, and the Forestdale Phase, A.D. 600-800. 59</page><page sequence="3">60 4U--.--Ue ..

This two-component site contained a small Linden Phase pueblo of eight rooms and an earlier Forestdale Phase unit containing two structures. Ariz. P: 16:63, Gobbler Tank Site, is a small, three room, seasonal structure probably belonging to the Linden Phase. SKIDDY CANYON RUIN Skiddy Canyon Ruin, Ariz. P:16:62 (Fig. 2), is situated on a gently sloping hill on the west side of U. S. Highway 60, approximately one mile south of the Forestdale Trading Post, in the southwest quarter of Section 34, T. 9 N., R. 21 E., Navajo County, Arizona. The general physiographic situation for this vicinity has been adequately described by Haury (1940: 10-16) and little more needs to be added. The site is located on an east-facing slope within the forested regions surrounding the Forestdale Valley. Elevation is somewhat lower than either the Bluff Site or the Bear Ruin with 6039.56 feet recorded on a U. S. Geological Survey benchmark 300 feet north of the site. Surface indications of prehistoric occupation were sherds, utilized stone, and a mound of rubble from fallen walls. The existing road cut through a portion of the site exposing a deep area of trash and fragments of burials. This deep trash proved to be the fill of the larger of two pit structures. The Linden Phase component consisted of a block of eight masonry rooms or sections of rooms, three burials, and a trash area. The present highway right-of-way fence cut across the rear row of rooms, leaving only one-half to one-fifth of a room for excavation. The front row of rooms and the trash area were completely excavated. Extensive testing, carried out to locate subterranean structures associated with the pueblo, was to no avail. Trash areas were excavated by trenching and stripping the refuse to sterile soil. Two burials were found in this refuse, and a third had been placed in a pit which extended to the floor of an earlier phase pit structure. The Forestdale Phase component of the site consisted of a pithouse, kiva, seven burials, and associated trash deposits. These features clustered near the existing highway cut 18 meters southeast of the room block. The cut had removed half of a large 61</page><page sequence="5">ceremonial structure and probably destroyed other architectural features. A few fragments of human bone were recovered from the cut, and local highway department personnel reported that some burials were uncovered when the road was originally constructed. This section of the site had received the greatest damage. The existing surface had been smoothed and graded, badly mixing the cultural materials. Several burials had been crushed by heavy machinery. ARCHITECTURE Architectural features of the Linden Phase were confined to the pueblo (Fig. 3). Rooms were rectangular and constructed of unprepared sandstone cobbles and slabs set into reddish clay mortar. Two periods of construction are evidenced by this masonry. The central cluster of rooms exhibited crude construc- tion using various sized cobbles laid in a careless fashion. Rooms to the north and south of the original block showed more selective construction with slabs and cobbles set into an even, well made wall. This may represent a slight time difference in construction with the outer rooms added to the original group at a somewhat later date. Floors were poorly made and were often no more than sterile soil. In the rear row of rooms prepared floors were absent, and room fill rested directly on uneven sterile soil. The front row exhibited some traces of a thin clay plastering, however, this was sketchy and uneven. In general, due to root and rodent activity a well-defined floor was not present. Floor features were found only in the front row of rooms (Fig. 4). Hearths were located in four rooms. Rectangular in shape and lined with standstone slabs, all were filled with greenish-gray ash and occasional fragments of sherd and stone. A cooking pit found in Room 2 consisted of a rectangular-shaped pit with a slab set into one side. Fire-cracked rock, ash, and a few sherds filled the pit. A possible mealing bin was found in Room 4 where two slabs set upright in the floor enclosed a basin-shaped pit lined with thin slabs and sherds. The cultural items used in the mealing process were missing. A corrugated jar was set into the floor against the wall in Room 5. The eastern wall of the front row of rooms was missing. The pueblo had been built on the downslope side of a small hill, and to 62</page><page sequence="6">TREE ROOM 6 OOM 4 ROOM 5 SKIDDY CANYON RUIN ROOM BLOCK ARIZONA P:I6:629 M CP COOK PIT P POT SET IN FLOOR 63 Fig. 3.

After abandonment, collapse of the roof, and the lowering of the walls, rain water washed away the leveling fill and shallow wall foundations, completely removing the masonry and scattering it downslope. The room block pattern of this site is typical of many small pueblo complexes. The front row of rooms, containing hearths and other floor features, comprised the living and indoor work area. The rear row of rooms, showing no prepared floors or floor features, was utilized for storage. Detailed descriptions of all rooms are given below. Fig. 4. Southern limit of the Linden Phase room block; Forestdale Phase component located at upper left bordering highway. Room 1 Construction: selected sandstone slabs and cobbles; south wall abuts west wall; east wall and section of floor missing.

Room 3 Construction: same as Room 2 although partial section of east wall remains. Dimensions: north wall 1.9 m., south wall 2.28 m., west wall 4.32 m.; greatest depth 72 cm.; average wall width 32 cm. Floor: fairly well smoothed with clay over sterile soil. Hearth: centrally located, rectangular, slab-lined; 45 by 31 cm.; depth 25 cm.; slabs extend 7 cm. above floor. Other Floor Features: none. Remarks: upper fill included fallen wall rubble and sherds; large restorable corrugated vessels and some artifacts on floor; one of the original rooms; used as living quarters. Room 4 Construction: well-made west and north walls consist of selected sandstone cobbles and slabs; east wall missing; south wall abutting west wall. Dimensions: north wall 2.3 m., south wall 2.8 m., west wall 2.4 m.; greatest depth 75 cm.; average wall width 30 cm. Floor: only small sections of thin clay over sterile soil remain; badly disturbed by root and rodent activity. Hearth: rectangular, centrally located and slab-lined; floor clay- lined and sloping; ash filled; one stone fire dog in position; 54 by 36 cm.; depth 46 cm. Other Floor Features: mealing bin in the southwest corner was a basin-shaped pit floored with slabs; metate rest of adobe and trash. Remarks: fill of fallen wall, clay and few potsherds; smaller room than usual; built at a later date as an addition to the main unit; probably used as a work area for food preparation. 65</page><page sequence="9">Room 5 Construction: good use of large block masonry with some chink- ing; only partially enclosed by masonry wall on the west; north and east walls completely missing. Dimensions: west wall 1.15 m., south wall 2.30 m. Floor: unprepared sterile soil. Hearth: none. Other Floor Features: large corrugated jar probably used for storage set into sterile soil with the mouth at floor level; some fragments of human bone in the fill of the jar. Remarks: area was probably intended to be a work space and was not completely enclosed; ramada-like structure may have been used although no trace could be found; Room 4 also may have been a ramada work area until the addition of the north wall. Room 6 Construction: selected sandstone slabs set in red mortar to form well-made wall; east wall abuts south wall of Room 7. Dimensions: incomplete since only one-third of room excavated; east wall 4.3 m.; greatest depth 60 cm.; average wall width 30 cm. Floor: no prepared floor present; uneven sterile soil utilized. Hearth: not located. Other Floor Features: none located. Remarks: fill consisted of relatively sterile red clay with some fallen wall rock and a few sherds; room only partially excavated due to right-of-way limitations; type of construction and abutment of east wall suggest a later addition as in Rooms 1, 4 and 5; room can be considered a storage room. Room 7 Construction: miscellaneous sandstone rocks of varying sizes and shapes laid in red clay mortar forming crude masonry walls. Dimensions: incomplete as only partially excavated; length 4.3 m.; postulated width 2.6 m. for all rear row units; greatest depth 65 cm.; average wall width 27 cm. Floor: no prepared floor; natural depression in the sterile soil near the wall was filled with trash to make an even base. Hearth: none located. Other Floor Features: none located. Remarks: fill consisted of hard reddish clay, some sherds and fallen wall; large masses of sherds were on floor level with some artifacts; room was one of the original rooms of the room block; lack of floor and associated features suggest that it was primarily used for storage. Room 8 Construction: same as Room 7. Dimensions: incomplete; length 4.25 m.; greatest depth 55 cm.; average wall width 27 cm. Floor: no prepared floor; uneven sterile soil utilized; natural depression against the east wall was filled with trash to make a level base. Hearth: none located. Other Floor Features: none located. Remarks: fill as in Room 7, although fewer sherds and other 66</page><page sequence="10">cultural debris; room was built during the construction of the original room block and was used for storage. The architectural units of the Forestdale Phase were repre- sented by two semi-subterranean structures, a pithouse and a kiva, both of which showed some damage by earlier road building activity. Both structures were circular and had been dug into the natural red clay soil which underlies the site. Walls were the unaltered sides of the pit. Some smoothing of the clay walls was visible, but plastering or other wall modifications were not made. Floors consisted of the natural sterile soil, were smoothed, and, except for traces of plastering in the kiva, were unprepared. Floor features were found in each structure, with post holes, storage cists, and hearths present. In both instances the eastern portion of the structure had been damaged, obliterating all traces of an entryway or ventilation system. Both structures had been aban- doned, and little cultural material remained on the floor.

BURIALS Ten burials were located at Arizona P:16:62. Seven were of the Forestdale Phase and three were of the Linden Phase; with one exception all were located in the area of the Forestdale Phase structures. Eight of these interments were in shallow, unlined pits surrounding the subterranean features. The ninth was a Linden Phase burial placed into the floor of the abandoned Forestdale Phase kiva. The isolated example, that of an infant, was in a shallow pit just east of the room block. Bone was generally in poor condition due to inadequate drainage, root and rodent damage, and previous road building activities. In several cases, only a few fragments remained with grave offerings. The Forestdale Phase burials were semi-flexed, on their back, with the knees turned to the left or right and arms at the sides (Fig. 8). Offerings consisted of pottery vessels, sherds, and shell. Vessels were usually placed at the shoulder. Where only sherds were found, they were predomi- nantly from one vessel, indicating that a whole or partial vessel had accompanied the interment at one time. 70</page><page sequence="14">The three burials of the Linden Phase show a somewhat different arrangement. The two burials, where enough remained for observation, showed a semi-to-tightly flexed position on the right side (Fig. 9). Offerings were at the head or by the side. Orientation of the body varied greatly. Forestdale Phase interments were generally oriented to the north and east, however, one to the south and one to the west were recorded. Linden Phase burials showed as many orientations as there were interments. Orientations to the north, south, and west occurred. " '."" ;:Ur' U '- ' U-` i ' Fig. 9.

The later burials differ considerably, showing a change of burial pattern during the 12th century. MATERIAL CULTURE Pottery was the most abundant form of material culture. Six- teen whole or restorable vessels and 7780 sherds were recovered and analyzed. Stone artifacts and lithic debris were the next most commonly occurring materials. Artifacts of shell, clay and bone occurred in that order of frequency. As many of the non-ceramic artifacts were found in trash deposits surrounding structures, phase designation has been difficult. In the following description phase designations will be given only in those cases where positive seriation existed. CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS Chert was the most frequently utilized material, accounting for 362 specimens including waste debris and artifacts. Quartzite and chalcedony accounted for 94 and 83 examples respectively. Petrified wood totaled 48 specimens and jasper 6. Obsidian was represented by only two examples, both projectile points. A fine-grained igneous rock was utilized occasionally. Utilized Flakes. There were 37 small, elongate chert and chalcedony flakes which generally showed simple retouching along one edge. Occasionally only usage fractures indicated that the flake had been utilized. Intentional flaking was at a minimum on these artifacts. Scrapers. Two types of scrapers were found. Four specimens were plano-convex, round in outline, and were chipped on both end and side. Four specimens were elongate flakes which showed secondary chipping along one side to produce an even face. A remaining scraper was a large chert nodule which was split and finely pressure flaked along one side to produce an even edge. Projectile Points. The projectile points from Arizona P: 16:62 showed a wide variety of styles and materials (Fig. 10a-c). Twelve examples were found in context in the Forestdale Phase component, five with the Linden Phase occupation, and three from the general site. Both triangular unnotched and side-notched types occurred in the Forestdale Phase while the only whole 72</page><page sequence="16">specimens in the Linden Phase were triangular and unnotched. Two early point types were found, one in each phase context. The only use of obsidian from the site was two small, broken, side-notched points from Pithouse 1. Drills. The one complete example of two specimens is of jasper and has an expanded base with the shaft tapering to a point (Fig. 10d). Flake Knife. A large primary flake was bifacially chipped along one edge to produce a fine cutting edge. Cores. These are the end products of the production of primary flakes from cobbles and nodules. All but one of the seven examples from the site are small rounded chert nodules covered pA , :r N ;U b d Ui:' d !I 9... ii .... ....l-l:- :- -- eh "I e f 9 Fig. 10.

A large chert core in the beginning stages of utilization is unusual in that a matching flake was found which had been partially modified into a side scraper. Choppers. Choppers were manufactured from river cobbles and nodules to make crude, hand held tools suitable for general cutting and chopping. One face had been unifacially flaked by percussion to form an irregular cutting edge. Much of the original cortex of the stone remained intact to facilitate hand usage. Three specimens were recovered. Hammerstones. Three types of hammerstones were recovered from the excavations. Nodules or cobbles which had been battered over their entire surface, approaching spherical shape, were the most common. Eleven examples of this type comprise the sample. Two cores saw additional use as hammers with restricted areas of use on several faces. The third category, pebble hammerstones, were small river cobbles used on either end. There was no modification except by usage. Four hammerstones were of this type. GROUND STONE ARTIFACTS Basalt, granite, quartzite, sandstone, and a fine-grained igneous rock were the major lithic materials utilized for ground stone implements. Manos, metates, worked slabs and other pecked and ground stone objects are grouped under this heading. The majority of specimens in this category were fragmentary and came from the trash areas of the site. Metates. The two types of metates from the ruin equate with the two periods of occupation. Seventeen fragments of trough metates were recovered in context with the Forestdale Phase structures. Slab metates, represented by two complete specimens, were found within the rooms of the Linden Phase pueblo. Sandstone and basalt were utilized for the slab metates and basalt and a fine-grained igneous rock for the trough type. Manos. Manos also equate with the different periods at the site. Three of the 6 complete specimens are long, thin, flat, unifacially worked slabs of the two-handed type. Two are made of basalt, the other of sandstone. These examples show two grinding surfaces on the utilized face and were used on slab metates. The remaining complete specimens are rounded, one-handed manos 74</page><page sequence="18">manufactured from river cobbles. Both ends are ground indicating use in trough metates. The majority of 26 mano fragments was found within the Linden Phase pueblo in the room fill. These are all fragments of the two-handed type, unifacially worked, used with slab metates. Miscellaneous Grinding Stones. These are oval cobbles which show some use as grinders. Two have been worked unifacially, a third bifacially. The worked surfaces are rough and indicate little actual use. These artifacts were utilized in grinding or polishing, not in connection with metates. Shaft Smoother. A fragment of a mano blank of fine-grained igneous rock with a shallow groove pecked on one face may have been used as a shaft smoother. Pot Cover. A sandstone slab was pecked and ground to obtain a circular outline and was perhaps utilized as a cover for a pottery vessel. Stone Bowl. A fine-grained igneous cobble had the central area pecked and ground forming a circular depression 4.5 cm. in depth. The rim was squared and ground flat. Worked Slabs. Four sandstone slabs pecked and ground to a rectangular shape were probably utilized as lap anvils. One fragment shows traces of red pigment. Medicine Stones. Two artifacts are small cylinders of vesicu- lar basalt of the type classified as medicine stones by Johnson and Wasley (1966: 235). Both occurred in Linden Phase context. Sandstone Disc. A thin piece of sandstone had been worked to achieve a circular outline. Paint. A small lump of hematite was the only indication of paint source found. Steatite Pendant. A triangular column of drilled steatite was incised with additional lines on one edge to produce the image of a human face (Fig. 11). BONE AND SHELL ARTIFACTS Artifacts of bone and shell were rare at Skiddy Canyon Ruin. Only six bone tools were found. Unworked animal bone was also scarce and has not been analyzed. Three types of shell were utilized: Glycymeris, Olivella and an unknown type used for discoidal beads. Bone Awls. Three classes of awl (Kidder 1932: 203-222) manufactured from mammal leg bones were recovered (Fig. 75</page><page sequence="19">10e-g). All were from the Linden Phase component. One specimen with the head of the bone intact, two examples with the head of the bone wholly or almost wholly removed, and one specimen with the head partially worked, comprise the complete collection from the ruin. All specimens were well made and well polished. A fragment of a rib awl was the only worked bone found in a Forestdale Phase context. Glycymeris Bracelet. Three small fragments of undecorated Glycymeris bracelets were recovered. All were associated with the Forestdale Phase component, two from the fill of the kiva, the third with a burial. Olivella Beads. Two examples are from Forestdale Phase burials. One specimen has had the spire removed by grinding. Discoidal Beads. Thirty-nine beads were small discs (2 cm. in diameter) and were found in the pueblo in a cache. Another discoidal shell bead came from the burial pit of a Forestdale Phase interment and was 5 cm. in diameter. CLAY ARTIFACTS Artifacts of clay, excluding whole vessels, were rather common. All were manufactured from sherds which had edges ground to form the desired shape. Most of the specimens from Skiddy Canyon Ruin are fragmentary and occurred with the Forestdale Phase component. Fig. 11. Steatite pendant, possibly anthropomorphic, with drilled suspension holes representing eyes. Length is 2.3 cm. 76</page><page sequence="20">Sherd Discs. Two complete and 7 fragmentary sherd discs are of two types. Those occurring with the Forestdale Phase have a hole drilled through the center. Two examples from the Linden Phase were not drilled. Miscellaneous Worked Sherds. Fourteen specimens were re- covered. Since all are fragmentary, function cannot be ascertained, although two large examples were probably used as scoops. CERAMICS The ceramic content of Skiddy Canyon Ruin is quite complex. Twenty-nine types were segregated, some without the benefit of type names. Eleven types occurred with the Forestdale Phase occupation. An unnamed and undescribed black-on-white ware in the Red Mesa style (Fig. 12 and Table 1) was found in large enough amounts to postulate a third period of occupation at the site, but no architectural features were located which could correspond to the pottery. These sherds resemble Haury's un- published Corduroy Black-on-white type from the Forestdale Valley. Haury (1940: 68, 96; 1947: 48-63) described the pottery of the earlier phases in the Forestdale Valley and recognized the following types in his material. Indigenous wares included a Forestdale variety of Alma Plain, Forestdale Plain, Forestdale Smudged, and Forestdale Red. Intrusive types from the Mogollon area were Woodruff Smudged, Woodruff Red, Adamana Brown, Alma Scored, Alma Incised, Alma Neckbanded, San Francisco Red, and Mogollon Red-on-brown. From the Anasazi culture area to the north Lino Gray, Lino Black-on-gray, White Mound Black-on-white, Lino Smudged, and a number of late types from Pueblo I to Pueblo III were recorded. Two ceramic types from the Hohokam area and one type from the Patayan area completed the list. The highway salvage excavations showed the same general ceramic picture with a few exceptions. A major difficulty arose in the separation of Alma Plain from Forestdale Plain. After repeated attempts to segregate these two types into a meaningful classifi- cation, all brownware sherds of this category were lumped under Alma Plain. Wendorf (1953: 115) encountered the same problem in classifying the brownware from the Twin Buttes site in the Petrified Forest National Monument, and included all "sand tempered, unsmudged, unslipped and undecorated brownware" in Forestdale Plain. 77</page><page sequence="21">AL p Fig. 12. Typical Red Mesa style black-on-white sherds from Arizona P: 16:62. Another problem was the distinction between Forestdale Smudged and Woodruff Smudged. Haury (1940: 74) states that Forestdale Smudged as compared with Mera's Woodruff Smudged is "thinner, much finer in paste, and more varied as to shape." After close examination of the type sherds in the Arizona State Museum collections a definite distinction between these two types could not be observed. Therefore, the smudged wares from the site were included under the heading of Forestdale Smudged. Sherds of Adamana Brown, Mogollon Red-on-brown, San Francisco Red, Lino Black-on-gray, Lino Smudged, Woodruff Red, Gila Plain, and Aquarias Brown were not recorded at Arizona P:16:62. These types were intrusive in the Bear Ruin although found in limited amounts. Kana-a Black-on-white, represented by three sherds, was the only type found at Arizona P: 16:62 that was not recorded at the Bear Ruin. 78</page><page sequence="22">TABLE 1. Total Sherd Tabulation.

Sherds typical of Snowflake Black-on-white from Arizona P: 16:62. An overfired variety of Alma Plain was prevalent. These sherds are typical Alma Plain except that the surface color varies from dull yellow to orange. It appears that this overfiring was a desired effect and was not simply due to faulty firing technique. Trade with the Hohokam was indicated by one sherd of Gila Butte Red-on-buff from the fill of the Forestdale Phase kiva. The ceramic complex of the Linden Phase has not been previously described. Seventeen types were recorded and probably more exist. Black-on-white, black-on-red, polychrome, and a variety of obliterated corrugated and smudged types occurred. The black-on-white wares resemble those from surrounding districts, although they do not exactly fit published descriptions. The majority closely resembles Snowflake Black-on-white in style (Fig. 13). Snowflake Black-on-white, however, is a problem in itself. In the most recent discussions of this type by Longacre (Martin et al 80</page><page sequence="24">1964: 110-112) three varieties were described as a result of excavations at the Carter Ranch site. Two varieties were based on design style, the other on a technical trait, the use of carbon paint. The general picture thus presented is Snowflake Black-on-white as an all-encompassing type including a large number of designs, a variety of combinations of these designs, and differences in paint. Unfortunately, other technical data were not presented. At Arizona P:16:62 three styles or types of Snowflake Black-on-white were locally made. These conform somewhat to those at the Carter Ranch site except that the carbon paint variety has hatching and typical Tularosa Black-on-white motifs. Another dissimilarity is the preponderance of jar sherds. The finish of the Snowflake style sherds from Forestdale is quite soft, and the white slip and paint are easily removed by scratching. There is a tendency for the normal black mineral paint to turn reddish brown in many examples. Other sherds show a green to purple glaze. Forestdale Snowflake pottery was sherd-tempered. Whether these differences can be accounted for in a single pottery type needs to be established by additional work. The establishment of new type names on the basis of one small excavated site has few merits and will not be done here. Perhaps the present description of the type should stand with the Forestdale material given varietal status, but a much larger sample is needed than was obtained. The remaining pottery types from the site fit reasonably well into existing categories. Tularosa Black-on-white is the second most common painted type. Pinto Black-on-red, Pinto Poly- chrome, St. Johns Polychrome, and Pinedale Polychrome were all represented. Culinary wares were separated on the basis of texture. The largest group is brown indented-corrugated with the corrugations obliterated to varying degrees. A variety of different corrugations occurs, but all show the characteristic smearing of the textured surface. McDonald Painted Corrugated was present in various degrees of fineness. The paint over the corrugations was present in most sherds, but some sherds placed in this category showed no traces of such decoration. Table 1 indicates the types present for both phases and the amount of sherds recovered. Sixteen whole or restorable vessels were recovered (Table 2 and Fig. 14). Half of these were with burials; the remainder were within the rooms of the Linden Phase Pueblo. 81</page><page sequence="25">TABLE 2. Whole Vessels.

DATING Since no datable wood was obtained during the excavation, dating must be done by inference through dated ceramic types for the later phase material. Breternitz (1966) has recently compiled tree-ring data with specific reference to pottery types. Known dates for the major pottery types recovered from Skiddy Canyon Ruin give a fairly accurate date for both occupations. Haury was able to obtain good tree-ring dates at the Bear Ruin and these correlate well with the earliest phase at Arizona P: 16:62. In Table 3 eight ceramic types were selected for dating the Linden Phase occupation. These dates fall within the range of the Linden Phase as originally defined; a time period of A.D. 1175 to 1225 is probable. The only two types clearly indigenous to the ruin show a relatively early beginning date. The Forestdale Phase component probably dates within the 8th century. The ceramics, although closely comparable to those found at the Bear Ruin, lack some of the earlier styles indicating a somewhat later date. A compilation of dates from the Bear Ruin (Bannister et al 1966: 29-30) shows that "most of the dates from the Bear Ruin fall in the 7th century without any clustering or 83</page><page sequence="27">cutting dates. All the pieces have an unknown number of rings gone from the outside. The presence of White Mound Black-on- white, dated elsewhere at post A.D. 725, suggests that the occupation of this village continued into at least the first half of the 8th century." THE GOBBLER TANK SITE The Gobbler Tank Site, Arizona P: 16:63, is situated on a small sandstone outcropping on the east side of U. S. Highway 60, approximately one-half mile south of the boundary line of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, in the northwest quarter of Section 11, T. 9 N., R. 21 E., Navajo County, Arizona. The general physiographic situation is much the same as at the Skiddy Canyon Ruin, although the elevation is somewhat higher at 6490 feet. The site is located within the existing right-of-way of U. S. 60 and had suffered some damage by previous road construction. A low mound of rock indicated the presence of a structure.

ARCHITECTURE The Gobbler Tank site consisted of a three room structure with basal walls constructed of sandstone slabs and blocks laid horizontally in clay mortar (Fig. 15). This structure contained one large rectangular room with two small rectangular rooms adjoining the south wall (Fig. 16). Floors were poorly defined except in one storage room where small slabs of sandstone were utilized for the floor. Bedrock comprised the floor in part of another room. Fallen wall rock was not present in amounts sufficient to indicate masonry walls more than a meter in height for the entire structure. Although no concrete evidence exists, the upper walls were probably of a perishable nature, such as poles or sticks covered with adobe. The structure is considered to be a seasonal unit, probably occupied only in the summer in connection with subsistence activity. Cultural material was very scarce, and the majority of tools were used in processing of agricultural products. t:" -; Fig. 16.

ARTIFACTS Ceramic and non-ceramic artifacts were scarce. No whole or restorable vessels were recovered and only 107 sherds located. Stone artifacts include three unifacial manos, two trough metate fragments, two cores, one core chopper and two sandstone slabs used to sharpen pointed implements. The most interesting artifacts were two sandstone building slabs with geometric designs carved in relief along one edge (Fig. 17). These are similar to incised building stones found in Anasazi ruins in northeastern Arizona (Kidder and Guernsey 1919: 196). CERAMICS The pottery from Gobbler Tank corresponds in part to that of Skiddy Canyon Ruin during the Linden Phase: Snowflake Black- on-white, Indented-corrugated and Obliterated Indented- corrugated. Two additional types, not found at Skiddy Canyon, 86</page><page sequence="30">were Salado Red and a coarse, sand-tempered, untextured brown- ware. Both are of a ceramic tradition not previously recorded in the Forestdale Valley. However, Salado Red has been reported by the University of Arizona Field School from recent excavations at Grasshopper Ruin, a large masonry pueblo located approximately 30 miles west of the Forestdale Valley.

Two periods of occupation were revealed at Skiddy Canyon, a Forestdale Phase component dating in the 8th century and a Linden Phase component dating about A.D. 1175 to 1225. Due to the limitations imposed by salvage work and the previous partial destruction of the site, a complete picture of the ruin could not be obtained. The original number of structures at the site, especially during the Forestdale Phase occupation, was probably somewhat greater than the two that remained. Most of the data obtained from the earlier occupation correlate closely with the material gathered by Haury during excavation of the Bear Ruin. The architectural features of the Forestdale Phase at Skiddy Canyon equate well with those from the Bear Ruin except for a few details in the kiva, mainly the lack of a bench, recesses, and floor trench. Burial patterns, lithic assemblages, and shell ornaments agree with the published descriptions. Only one ceramic type, Kana-a Black-on-white, occurred at Arizona P: 16:62 but not at the Bear Ruin. The later period occupation, represented by the Gobbler Tank site and the masonry pueblo at Skiddy Canyon Ruin can be considered representative of the Linden Phase which is tentatively outlined here. LINDEN PHASE DESCRIPTION Area: Forestdale Valley at present, possibly west of Show Low, Arizona. Age: about A.D. 1100 to 1200 based on ceramic dating. Excavated sites: Arizona P:16:62 and P:16:63. Environment: pinyon and yellow pine forest at 6000-7000 feet. Architecture: small three to ten room masonry pueblos; crude walls of unshaped rock set in clay mortar; rectangular slab-lined hearths and, occasionally, cooking pits within rooms; poorly prepared clay floors; contiguous storage rooms without floor features; no kiva found; incised building stones. Economy: primarily agricultural with minor hunting. Indigenous pottery: Snowflake Black-on-white, MacDonald Paint- ed Corrugated, Obliterated Indented-corrugated. Intrusive pottery: Tularosa Black-on-white, Mimbres Black-on- white, Show Low Black-on-red, Pinto Black-on-red, Pinto Poly- chrome, St. Johns Polychrome, Pinedale Polychrome, Indented- corrugated, Pattern Corrugated. Ground stone: slab metates; rectangular, two-handed, unifacial manos, some with two grinding surfaces on utilized face; hammer- stones; basalt medicine stones; steatite pendant. 88</page><page sequence="32">Chipped stone: triangular, unnotched projectile points; simple side scrapers; utilized flakes; expanded base drill. Bone artifacts: awls made from mammal long bones. Clay artifacts: unperforated sherd discs; sherd scoops. Disposal of the dead: semi-flexed on side with pottery vessels; in trash outside of rooms.
