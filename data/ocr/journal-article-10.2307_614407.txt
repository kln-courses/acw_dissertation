<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBITUARIES SIR HAMILTON ALEXANDER ROSKEEN GIBB With the death of Sir Hamilton Alexander Roskeen Gibb on 22 October 1971 oriental scholarship lost one of whom it may be truly said that he illumined all aspects of Islamic studies which he touched. He will be mourned by his colleagues and friends of many and various nationalities, and also by countless students whom he initiated into the study of Arabic and Islamic civilization and guided along the paths of scholarship and understanding, and some of whom, including the writer of this notice, owe to his guidance and inspiration an incalculable debt. In the School of Oriental and African Studies where Sir Hamilton held his first teaching appointment, the tradition of teaching and scholarship which he founded can, perhaps, still be said to be a 'living tradition'. Sir Hamilton brought a keen mind and wide experience to his study of Islamic civilization and his meticulous and rigorous standards of scholarship, coupled with a readiness to consider new ideas and modern techniques, gave to his work a breadth and vision unequalled by any other Islamic scholar. He had the greatest respect for the orientalist who confined himself to the strictly classical field and whose function he regarded as essential for the further study of Islamic culture as a whole, but he also recognized the need to broaden the bases of oriental studies without undermining their solid academic foundations. This recognition was not due to any desire to bow to contemporary fashion- indeed Sir Hamilton in his wish for interdisciplinary study was ahead of his time--but arose from his belief that a certain flexibility and willingness to use the insights offered by other disciplines were needed for a fuller interpretation of Islamic civilization. In this fuller interpretation the sociologist and the economist had their part to play, but the central role in his view still belonged to the orientalist, whose function was to see the social and economic data not simply as isolated facts, explicable in and by themselves, but in the broad context and long perspective of cultural habit and tradition. Sir Hamilton was born on 2 January 1895, in Egypt at Alexandria, where his father was farm manager for the Aboukir Land Reclamation Company. He was educated in Scotland at the Edinburgh Royal High School and Edinburgh University, which he entered in 1912, reading Semitic Languages (Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic). In the 1914-18 war he served in the Royal Field Artillery and saw active service in France and Italy. In 1919 he applied for a war degree from Edinburgh University and then became a research student in Arabic at the then School of Oriental Studies, receiving the M.A. degree of the University of London in 1922. He had already been appointed in 1921 as a lecturer in Arabic under Sir Thomas Arnold. In 1926-7 he made his first prolonged visit to the Middle East and began his study of contemporary Arabic literature, having previously spent two long vacations in North Africa. In 1929 he was appointed reader in Arabic history and literature in the University of London</page><page sequence="2">SIR HAMILTON ALEXANDER ROSKEEN GIBB BSOAS. XXXV]</page><page sequence="3">OBITUARIES 339 (tenable at the School) and in 1930, on the death of Sir Thomas Arnold, succeeded him in the Chair of Arabic in the University of London (tenable at the School). He also succeeded Sir Thomas Arnold as the British editor of the Encyclopaedia of Islam, and became one of the original editors of the revised edition, retiring in 1956. He contributed many articles to both editions. He held the London Chair until 1937 when he became Laudian Professor of Arabic in the University of Oxford and consequently a Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford. This post he held until 1955, though during the second World War his services were again given to his country both at home and abroad. The years at Oxford were fruitful and happy years, though Sir Hamilton was never, perhaps, wholly satisfied there. In going to Oxford from London he had hoped that the older university would offer a more open field for the broadening out of Arabic and Islamic studies, but he was soon ' undeceived in these hopes' and found that 'the jealous rigidity of Faculty and School lines inhibited any attempt to cross them even at the level of graduate study '. After the war Sir Hamilton became increasingly convinced of the need for Anglo- French collaboration for the rebuilding of Europe and European civilization, for lasting settlement in Europe and also for any cultural programme in the Middle East, though he recognized the difficulties which might for a time attend any efforts to work with the French. Secondly, realizing the growing influence of the United States in the Middle East, he was convinced of the desirability of the creation of an informed body of opinion on the Middle East in that country. When, therefore, the invitation came in 1955 to join Harvard as University Professor and James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic, and seeing, as he thought, the possibility of building up regional studies on a sound academic basis-though as he later admitted ' between the opportunity and its fulfilment lay a chasm, too broad to overleap and negotiable only by a patient labour of bridge building '-after due and careful consideration he took the difficult decision to move to the United States. This decision, I think it true to say, he never regretted, though it had, at the time, caused him much heart-searching. In Harvard he and Lady Gibb made a wide circle of friends and large numbers of students, many of whom have since made their mark, passed through Sir Hamilton's hands. In 1957 he became Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. In 1964 he retired from the teaching faculty at Harvard as Professor Emeritus and James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic Emeritus but con- tinued as head of the Center, intending to divide his time between Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his home in Oxford, but in that year he was struck down by illness, from the physical effects of which he never fully recovered. The remaining years of his life were spent in Oxford, where he was devotedly cared for by Lady Gibb until her untimely death in 1969. These were years of great privation, of an incapacity courageously and patiently-even willingly-borne with no trace of self-pity or word of complaint. Sir Hamilton's world-wide reputation as a scholar is borne witness to by the many honours which he received and the numerous learned societies of</page><page sequence="4">340 OBITUARIES which he was made a member or honorary member. He became a Fellow of the British Academy in 1944, was made a Knight Bachelor in 1954, and was an honorary LL.D. of Edinburgh, an honorary Litt.D. of Harvard, and an hono- rary Dr. of Algiers. He was a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He was also a Foundation Member of the Fuad I Academy of the Arabic Language, Cairo, an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the Danish Academy, a Member of the American Philosophical Society, an Associate Member of the Institut d'Igypte, and Chairman of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names from 1947 to 1955. Sir Hamilton was a generous scholar, who neither denied his debt to earlier scholars nor his own insights and knowledge to others. His work is marked by integrity and objectivity, and a deep humanity and understanding. The limits of his interests and knowledge as a scholar were set only by the bounds of the civilization which he studied. It is impossible in this short account to cover adequately his contribution to Islamic studies. His work falls into three main categories: Arabic literature and language, Islamic history and institutions, and lastly Islam and its politico-religious ideas and ideals. His first book was The Arab conquests in Central Asia (1923), a monograph on a well-defined subject, which is a critical and meticulous examination of the relationships of the heterogeneous groups concerned in these conquests. This was followed in 1926 by Arabic literature, of which a second revised edition was published in 1963. Although intended to be merely an introduction indicating the scope of Arabic literature, it bears witness to great erudition and a wide acquaintance with Arabic writings. In 1928 the first of a series of' Studies in contemporary Arabic literature ', 'The nineteenth century ', appeared in the Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, to be followed in 1929 by ' Manfaliati and the " new style "' and 'Egyptian modernists' and in 1933 by 'The Egyptian novel '. These important articles broke new ground and are among the earliest attempts to make a scholarly examination of modern Arabic literature and to estimate its role in modernist movements. Sir Hamilton had, indeed, a deep feeling for the Arabic language and Arab artistic creation as displayed in Arabic literature. Among his favourite Arabic works were the 'Prolegomena' of Ibn Khaldian. For over 40 years he knew and delighted in the work of Ibn Khaldfin, whom he described as the 'lively, direct, colorful, brilliantly imaginative, exuberantly eloquent Ibn Khald-fn, whose ideas stream out in long cascades, sometimes indeed tumbling into excited incohesion, but for the most part held together by a taut and beautiful modulated structure of prose, controlled by precise and refined mechanisms of coordination and subordination, and articulated with a trained elegance that gives to every word the exact degree of emphasis required by his argument'. Though classical Arabic literature was, perhaps, Sir Hamilton's first love, it was to Islamic history that he made his major contribution. Fundamental to his approach was the belief that neither could be studied in isolation from</page><page sequence="5">OBITUARIES 341 the other without distortion of the underlying reality, since both were ex- pressions of a living society. The basic characteristic of his work, however, was his emphasis on historical thinking. For him, history was a search for the patterns on the web of human life and the real historian was he who tried first to discover and then to investigate the patterns that were already there, ' woven into the web of human life in time past by the actions of innumerable individuals'. In this field, too, his early work was of a traditional kind. In 1932, he published a translation of Ibn al-Qalanisi's Damascus chronicle of the Crusades, an indis- pensable source for students of the early Crusades. Intended as a textbook for students, it contains a masterly introduction on Syria at the time of the first Crusade. In the following year there appeared in BSOS an article entitled 'The Islamic background of Ibn Khaldfin's political theory', which demon- strates Sir Hamilton's rigorous examination of his texts, his understanding of Muslim society, and refusal to be led away by fashionable theories based on an inadequate examination of the sources. ' Al-Mawardi's theory of the caliphate ', which was published in Islamic Culture in 1937, can, perhaps, be fairly described as a landmark in the study of Islamic political theory. It is the first attempt made to see the work of al-Mawardi in its own setting and is a brilliant analysis of al-Mawardi's doctrine of Islamic government. In 1939 ' Some considerations on the Sunni theory of the caliphate' appeared in Archives d'Histoire du Droit Oriental. This was a brief survey of the development of Sunni political theory, which was written to demonstrate that the inner reality was quite other than would appear from the external formulations of the jurists and also to show that underneath the complex forms developed by the different schools and sects there was a common Islamic conviction overriding all superficial differences of creed. Meanwhile, together with Mr. Harold Bowen, Sir Hamilton had been entrusted by the Royal Institute for International Affairs with a study on the effects of the Western impact upon Turkey and its former Arab provinces since the beginning of the nineteenth century. Two better matched scholars could hardly have been found. But the task was immense and demanded as a preliminary step an examination of the institutions and social organization of the Ottoman Empire in the eighteenth century. The work progressed slowly, perhaps partly because both were perfectionists. It was, indeed, a major undertaking, the formidable nature of which the joint authors, as they confessed in the introduction to the first volume, had no idea when they undertook the charge. Part I of Volume I went to press just before the outbreak of war and was finally published in 1950 with the title Islamic society and the West : Islamic society in the eighteenth century. It consisted of a survey of social institutions in Turkey and its Arab provinces prior to the introduction of Western influences, an examination of the circumstances and immediate effects of the Western impact since the beginning of the nineteenth century, and an investigation into the actual conditions and forces in play. Sir Hamilton was mainly responsible for the introductory chapters on the Islamic historical background and the sections on the Arab provinces. Part II appeared in 1957. These volumes,</page><page sequence="6">342 OBITUARIES as their authors frankly admitted, could be no more than a provisional and general survey, pending the publication of studies based on a careful and thorough examination of the enormous mass of documents in the Turkish archives. It was hardly their fault that their work was overtaken, and in some measure superseded, by that of scholars working on the archives. Nevertheless, Islamic society and the West served a useful introductory purpose. In 1953 Sir Hamilton published another brilliant and stimulating article, 'An interpretation of Islamic history', in the Journal of World History, showing how medieval Islamic history was dominated by the effort of the Sunni religious institution to maintain its universalism against internal and external challenges and to realize the widest possible measure of religious, social, and cultural unity throughout the Islamic world. This was followed in the same year by an important article on 'The social significance of the Shu'tiblya ' in Studia orientalia Ioanni Pedersen. This article again reveals Sir Hamilton's understanding of Muslim society and the conflicts and struggles within it, based on his wide reading of the sources. He points out that the issue at stake was 'no superficial matter of literary modes and fashions but the whole cultural orientation of the new Islamic society-whether it was to become a re-embodi- ment of the old Perso-Aramaean culture into which Arabic and Islamic elements would be absorbed, or a culture in which the Perso-Aramaean contributions would be subordinated to the Arab tradition and the Islamic values '. Here, and elsewhere, Sir Hamilton shows the conflict between the Islamic ethic and Sasanian tradition, which ' introduced into Islamic society a kernel of derange- ment never wholly assimilated yet never wholly rejected'. In 'The evolution of government in early Islam', which appeared in Studia Islamica in 1955, he elaborates the theory that the basis of the Islamic body politic was ideological and that as a result of the spread of Islamic doctrines a new type of social order evolved, which was, at bottom, an adaptation of the pre-existing social organisms in the spirit of the new doctrines, and which found expression in a series of appropriate institutions which were created by the labours of successive generations of Muslims. Discussing the question of power in the early Islamic state, he assesses in this connexion, the significance of the first civil war, and the Umayyad and 'Abbasid caliphates, and points out that the 'Abbasid caliphate ' so far from adapting its practice to the principles of Islamic theology, imposed on the official jurists of Islam the task of adapting their principles to its practice'. In the same year there appeared in Arabica an article entitled ' The fiscal rescript of 'Umar II ', which demonstrates Sir Hamilton's skill and competence in the more concrete field of administrative history. In a later article, ' Arab-Byzantine relations under the Umayyad caliphate ', published in Dumbarton Oaks Papers, xII, in 1958, he shows how the fiscal and adminis- trative policies of HishIm were consistently directed to establishing the Arab empire as heir to the oriental tradition and the successor of the Persian Sasanian empire. Another article, 'Islamic biographical literature', published in 1962 in Historians of the Middle East (edited by Professors B. Lewis and P. M. Holt),</page><page sequence="7">OBITUARIES 343 reveals anew how for Sir Hamilton the study of literature and history comple- mented one another. It was perhaps, in his books and articles more specifically on Islam that Sir Hamilton's deep and wide understanding of the Muslim mind is most evident. His approach to Islam as he states in his preface to Mohammedanism (1949), was influenced by two convictions, 'one that Islam is an autonomous expression of religious thought and experience, which must be viewed in and through itself and its own principles and standards ; the other, that while the practice of every religion to some extent falls short of its own highest ideals, the exposition of an outside observer should lay more stress upon the ideals which it strives to realize than upon the failings of our common humanity'. It was this approach which enabled him to treat his subject objectively. But his work was also illumined by an intuitive understanding, deriving from his own experience of and belief in the truths of Christianity. In his foreword to Modern trends in Islam (1947) he wrote, 'I make bold to say that the metaphors in which Christian doctrine is traditionally enshrined satisfy me intellectually as expressing symbolically the highest range of spiritual truth which I can conceive, provided that they are interpreted not in terms of anthropomorphic dogma but as general concepts, related to our changing views of the nature of the universe. I see the church and the congregation of Christian people as each dependent on the other for continued vitality, the church serving as the accumu- lated history and instrument of the Christian conscience, the permanent element which is constantly renewed by the stream of Christian experience and which gives both direction and effective power to that experience. My view of Islam will necessarily be the counterpart of this. The Muslim church and its members constitute a similar composite, each forming and reacting on the other so long as Islam remains a living organism and its doctrines satisfy the religious consciousness of its adherents. While giving full weight to the historical structure of Muslim thought and experience, I see it also as an evolving organism, recasting from time to time the content of its symbolism, even though the recasting is concealed (as it is to a considerable extent in Christianity) by the rigidity of its outward formulas '. It was precisely this inner certainty which gave a keen and cutting edge to his perception of the religious consciousness of Muslims and understanding of Islam as an evolving organism, and a generous and humble attitude of mind which led him to see that Christians and Muslims were engaged in a common spiritual enterprise, even though their ways diverged. Professor G. Levi Della Vida in his letter of dedication to Arabic and Islamic studies in honor of Hamilton A. R. Gibb, edited by George Makdisi and presented to Sir Hamilton on his seventieth birthday by his colleagues and friends from many different countries, states that the originality of Sir Hamilton's work, which made him rank with the most prominent Islamic scholars of all ages, lay in the perfect balance which he kept between the study of ancient and contem- porary Islam and in his firm and continuous consciousness of the fundamental</page><page sequence="8">344 OBITUARIES unity of Islamic civilization. This is, no doubt true, but it would also, I think, be true to say--as Sir Hamilton himself once remarked-that it was precisely because he was essentially a medievalist that he was able to understand modern Islamic movements. It was his firm belief that an understanding of Islam and an appreciation of the issues with which it was confronted at the present day and the forces with which it was equipped to meet them could only be obtained through its history, and it was, indeed, his concentrated and rigorous study of the past which enabled him to interpret and look with understanding upon modern movements. In addition to his other work Sir Hamilton also had in hand a translation of the Travels of Ibn Bat~at.ta. He had published in 1929 selected passages. Volume I of the unabridged translation was published by the Hakluyt Society in 1958. Volume II came out in 1962 ; Volume III was seen through the press by Professor Charles Beckingham and did not appear until December 1971, after Sir Hamilton's death. The travels of Ibn Bat.ittta are a model of what translation should be : accurate, concise, elegant and with notes which, although kept to a minimum, tell the reader what he would wish to know. Apart from The travels of Ibn Bat~it.ta, Sir Hamilton's last published work was a series of three articles, 'The heritage of Islam in the modern world', in the International Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, 1969 and 1970, in which he revealed once more the complex interplay between the ideal concepts of Islam and the social realities of Islamic society, and showed that in spite of illness, his mind had lost none of its vigour, clarity, or masterly sweep. Shortly before he died, Sir Hamilton had been preparing for publication The life of Saladin from the works of 'Imad ad-Din and BahM ad-Din. This is to be published posthumously by the Clarendon Press. Sir Hamilton was not only a writer, he was also a trainer of men. He was not one to exert pressure on a student to embark upon oriental studies. Indeed, I clearly remember him pointing out to me when I first began, the possible disadvantages of undertaking such a course. He strongly believed that the approach must be made freely, but once the commitment was made, no one could have been more generous with his help and encouragement, and acceptance of his students as fellow workers in the same field, an assurance which meant much to the young and aspiring scholar. He was a first-class teacher at both undergraduate and graduate level. His lectures, whether on Arabic syntax, the ' Prolegomena ' of Ibn Khaldfin, Islamic history, institutions, or political ideas were an exciting experience. Like all good teachers, he refrained from seeking to impose his own ideas, but rather sought to train the minds of his students to distinguish for themselves between the true and the false and to stretch their endeavours so that they might reach their highest capabilities. Although enormously tolerant of the callowness of youth, he expected high standards of his students and did not easily accept sloppy or inaccurate work. Knowing that many of those who passed through his hands were likely to become in their own turn teachers, and perhaps because he realized the likelihood that there would in future be pressure</page><page sequence="9">OBITUARIES 345 to lower standards, he was deeply concerned that these should be maintained. I remember his saying to me some years after I had been appointed to a univer- sity post 'one of your great tasks will be to see that standards are kept up '. He saw clearly that nothing would discredit Islamic studies so much as for them to become the refuge of the second- and third-class scholar. The training he gave to post-graduate students was admirable. While always willing to give of his time, he never allowed an undue dependence. Once he had set the student on the way and initiated him into the techniques of research, he expected him to get on with his work with a minimum of guidance-but that guidance, often unobtrusively given, was invaluable. Frequently the few words written on the margin of a paper would open up a new dimension, suggest a new range of inquiry, or cause the pieces of what had till then been a meaningless puzzle to fall into place. He always insisted upon a rigorous and meticulous examination of the sources, and wisely also insisted on a frequent assessment and writing up of the material accumulated. He was himself a perfectionist and he expected his students also to write and rewrite, to polish and repolish. For this careful training many of his students, and not least the writer of this notice, have been immensely grateful. It would not be fitting to close this brief notice without tribute to Lady Gibb, whom he married in 1922, and mention of his family and home. Lady Gibb, whom he once described as 'in truth a wonderful woman', was a very real companion and help to him. They had one son, Ian, born in 1923, and a daughter, Dorothy, born in 1926. They were a devoted and close-knit family. When in due course their son and daughter married and had children, this was a new source of joy to both Sir Hamilton and Lady Gibb. It was a privilege and pleasure to visit them in their home in Northmore Road in Oxford and later at Belsyre Court. When they returned from the United States and made their home once more in Oxford, this time in Cumnor, they again extended the same warm and kindly welcome to all their friends. I personally never came away from a visit without being intellectually and spiritually refreshed. A. K. S. LAMBTON</page></plain_text>
