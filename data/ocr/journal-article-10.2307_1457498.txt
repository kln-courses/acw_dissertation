SELLERS* A WE stand at the threshold of the second half of our twentieth century of the Christian era we find life not as sim- ple nor as static as it was for our forebears. The earth as well as the sun does move and the movement affects the biblical instructor as well as everybody else. In physics, chem- istry, mathematics, history (ancient and mod- em), psychology, public speaking, music, art, philosophy, biology, and language immense developments have taken place in the last fifty years. The teacher who would impart to his pupils only what Mark Hopkins gave to his companion on the log would be incapable of holding a post in an accredited high school. So the biblical instructor who would follow the patterns which were effective at the turn of the century would soon find himself without pupils and without a job. The students are not the same as the students of a generation ago, neither is the corpus of material which we are expected to teach. We are faced with a new set of problems. For one thing, among students who are in high school, college, or seminary there is an illiteracy about the Bible with which our aca- demic fathers did not have to contend. Of course today schooling in America is far more extensive than ever before. With our com- pulsory education everybody whose parents have not cheated the law knows how to read and write, though the reading may be confined to the comics and the writing have no regard for spelling, punctuation, or grammar. In the good old days, which some of us are suffi- ciently advanced in age to remember, most boys and girls considered themselves suffi- ciently educated to cope with life when they had conquered the three R's, with perhaps a smattering of American history, and aban- doned formal instruction when they completed grade school, if indeed they had not dropped out along the way. Those who went on to high school were given courses designed for culture rather than for productive citizenship. They took Latin, algebra, plane and solid geometry, ancient, mediaeval and modem history, phys- ics or chemistry, German or French. Some of them took Greek. The English course was for two years instead of the four years now preva- lent; but the student had learned something about parsing sentences in grade school and his Latin gave him a knowledge of grammar. I am not maintaining that these courses for high school students in general were more de- sirable than shop work, music appreciation, civics, domestic science, or shorthand as they are given today; but they did more or less fit the student to understand what the biblical instructor would have to say when he reached college or seminary. Moreover he could be counted on to know something about the Bible. Either at home or in Sunday school probably he would have learned the books of the Bible in order, the Lord's Prayer, the Twenty-Third Psalm, and the Ten Commandments. One of his childhood toys would have been a Noah's ark with various animals, Noah, Shem, Ham, Japheth, and their wives. He would have heard * Dean of McCormick Theological Seminary, Chi- cago, and President of Mid-Western Section of NABI for 1950 113</page><page sequence="2">114 0. R. SELLERS about Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, David and Goliath, Joseph and Mary, Peter and Paul. At Christmas and Easter he would have learned about the birth, crucifixion, and resur- rection of Jesus. He would know nothing of existentialism, the documentary hypothesis, Formgeschichte, confrontation, or group dy- namics; but he would know that Moses led the children of Israel from Egypt, that Daniel was put into the den of lions, and that there were twelve apostles. So the biblical instructor could presume on an elementary acquaintance with the Book of Books. Today the biblical instructor can count on no such acquaintance. The speed of modern life has played havoc with the family altar. A popular philosophy which had great influence on the schools of our country held it unwise to mention God to a child under ten. The gory stories of the battles of the Israelites and the cruelty of the crucifixion were held unfit for tender ears, and it was considered improper to urge a child to learn anything until he had developed a curiosity about it. Naturally there are some students who come with a knowledge of the principal Bible stories. They come from the more conservative groups and they are likely to put more stress on a theory of in- spiration or a quirk of interpretation than on what the Bible itself has to say. Sometimes they are more of a problem to the teacher than are the students with no previous biblical knowledge. But on the whole the teacher in college can safely assume that he is introducing his Bible class to a completely fresh subject. From experience I can say the same thing of the teacher in seminary. He rejoices in the students who have had a good Bible course in college, but they are in a minority. They are able to make better academic records and they generally show more interest in class than do the students who come with no Bible knowl- edge except that which they picked up in a progressive Sunday school or a summer con- ference. But the seminary teacher who pre- supposes any biblical knowledge at all in the entering junior class finds that he is making a mistake. One of the reasons for the biblical illiteracy of students is the jealousy or hostility of the instructor's colleagues. In the days of our fa- thers the teacher was expected to be a religious man or woman, a moral as well as intellectual example to the students. School boards and college presidents were concerned about the church membership of the applicant. Such courses as Bible history and Evidences of Christianity were in the prescribed curriculum. Most state universities were little if any larger than the denominational colleges and the pri- vately endowed universities were under church auspices. Then, to use a popular cliche, there came the great wave of secularism. Separation of church and state became such a fetish that public schools were not allowed to teach the Bible even as English literature. Along with secularism came the great increase in special- ization. Vast areas of new knowledge were opened, so that one who would gain a reputa- tion in his field had scant time for attention to any but the most closely related fields. From the presses came so many technical books that the teacher who aspired to be also a scholar or even to hold to his job was so exhausted with his professional reading that his time for leisurely reading for pleasure was greatly curtailed. So the casual, to say nothing of the devotional, reading of the Bible went out of vogue. Now many scientists, knowing only that the Bible represented the earth as being created in six days, 4004 B.C., and the sun as standing still at the command of Joshua, counted the book as untrue and irrelevant. Their attitude came to be shared even by philosophers, edu- cationists, and teachers of literature. They were enlightened, emancipated and they let the students know that they considered the Bible teacher a purveyor of old wives' tales and mediaeval superstitions. Many a biblical instructor has felt that he was scorned, or at best tolerated, by his colleagues who were dealing with facts and applying the scientific method. While the virile, tough-minded stu- dents went out for electronics, oil geology, do- mestic science, or physical education, he had</page><page sequence="3">NEW PROBLEMS FOR THE BIBLICAL INSTRUCTOR 115 to content himself with the starry-eyed sissies and the few sturdy souls who were strong enough to brave the jibes of their stalwart fellows. Maybe we are on the eve of a reaction. Hollywood has become interested. Millions of young Americans have seen Victor Mature slay the Philistines with the jawbone of an ass and it is announced that one of our most competent colleagues has been engaged as tech- nical adviser for the filming of the story of David and Bathsheba. Still, at present, the biblical instructor faces a student body to whom the prophet Isaiah is as strange as a genitive absolute. Another new problem is the body of knowl- edge, relating to the Bible, which has grown since World War I. Before that time in Ameri- can colleges the typical Bible teachers, ex- cepting the few pioneers like the founders of this association, were retired pastors ready to spend their declining years in the genial at- mosphere of educational halls. From long ex- perience in preparing sermons they knew the contents of Holy Writ and they were Godly, often lovable, characters. They had a good knowledge of the Latin and Greek classics and they had studied some Hebrew; but they skirted wide of higher criticism. Hadn't Charles A. Briggs been unfrocked by the Presbyterian Church and Hinkley G. Mitchell ousted from Boston University because they doubted the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch? It was the part of wisdom to be safe and to refrain from anything which could be considered mu- tilation of the Word of God. So the biblical instructor stuck to the inspired text of the King James version, with occasional references to the Revised Version, and required his stu- dents to learn something of what was therein recorded. There were two reasons for the retention of such teachers in college faculties and in facul- ties of private secondary schools. One was economical: the elderly minister, with his chil- dren grown and self-sustaining, could be se- cured for a smaller salary than would be demanded by a young scholar with children to educate. The other was prudential: nothing that he would teach would bring about an investigation by angry trustees to whom word had come that he was undermining his stu- dents' faith in the Bible. If he mentioned higher criticism he denounced it. If he was a Baptist he emphasized the necessity of immersion for complete salvation; if he was a Methodist he stressed responsibility of the individual with the danger of backsliding; if he was a Pres- byterian he preached predestination and justi- fication by faith. Sometimes he was a character, who by his antics and apothegms drilled some biblical knowledge into his students. Some- times he was merely a gentle bore. Today the biblical instructor must be a different personality. Astronomy, geology, and biology have shown that the earth is more than 6,000 years old and that the life span of our antediluvian ancestors and the patriarchs was no greater than ours. Even in the Bible Belt, as the Scopes trial showed, some youthful minds were being exposed to what one saint called "that damnable doctrine of evolution." So the gentle old retired pastor was unable to cope with the situation. Now it became necessary for the biblical instructor to know something about new knowledge in other fields and also to know something about the Bible besides its contents. Though he need not have studied higher mathematics or physics he must be somewhat cognizant of the implications of such terms as relativity, radioactivity, and nuclear fission. And in his own field he must have at least a bowing acquaintance with the great advances that have been made in the last quarter of a century. From the turn of the century through World War I biblical scholarship was fairly com- fortable. In general those who were interested were divided into two camps. There were those rejoicing in the opprobrious epithet "higher critic" and on the other hand the conservative or orthodox. The higher critic pursued his study with slight variations on Wellhausen, Delitzsch, Buhl, Budde, Duhm, and young</page><page sequence="4">116 0. R. SELLERS Bertholet in the Old Testament, and Harnack, Clemen, and the young Schweitzer in the New Testament. The traditional view was defended by such stalwarts as K6nig, John R. Davis, Robert Dick Wilson, and Zahn. Neither side had great effect on the other. Young scholars either in compliance with the early teachings to which they had been subjected or in revolt against such teachings soon chose their sides and rarely shifted. The equipment necessary for the competent teacher of the Bible was not great. If he was an Old Testament man he had to know some Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, Assyrian, Syr- iac, Arabic, and Ethiopic. It was helpful if he knew some Sumerian, Egyptian, and Coptic. But textbooks in these languages were not very large and he could acquire the necessary acquaintance during the three years' course for the Ph.D. If he was a New Testament man he would know Latin, Greek, and enough Ara- maic, Hebrew, and Syriac for a little compara- tive study. The teacher competent to teach the whole Bible, but not too thoroughly com- mitted to specialization, would at least be familiar with the three biblical languages and George Adam Smith's Historical Geography of the Holy Land. Today anyone who would pose as a biblical scholar, as any biblical instructor would like to do when he stands before his class, must be aware of a vast amount of pertinent new material which has come to light in the last quarter of a century and which is steadily growing. There must be considered the matter of translations. No longer can one take the American Standard Revised Version as the most authentic translation, pointing out that the alternate readings in the margin are supe- rior to the readings in the body of the text. The Moffatt translation enjoys such wide popu- larity that last year the publishers felt justi- fied in bringing out a concordance. The Chicago Bible, too, continues to have a large sale, and another revision of it is in the making. Many teachers use one of these as the textbook with the result that some complain because the students no longer meet the phrases like "take no thought for the morrow," "sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal," "and on earth peace, good will toward men," and "the beauty of holiness." The new translations may be more accurate, but they remove some stereotypes which are part of our English literature. Now we have the New Standard Revised Version of the New Testament and are awaiting the results of the revision of the Old Testament promised for next year. Both Catholics and Jews also are working on the revisions of their translations and Msgr. Knox has completed his translation through Maccabees. Should the teacher go all out for one of these translations or should he stick to the King James, using introductory and explanatory notes like those in the Westminster Study Bible? It is necessary also for the competent teacher to be aware of the textual studies which are going forward. The Septuagint specialists are showing that the last word has not been spoken regarding the Greek translations of the Old Testament. While the third edition of the Kit- tel Biblia Hebraica is far ahead of any previous Hebrew Bible, it has some inaccuracies. The finding and publishing of the Dead Sea Scrolls of Isaiah and the Habakkuk commentary have created a lively interest and are being studied by scholars in many countries. Already the Theologische Literaturzeitung has published thirteen articles about them. The tremendous project of photographing manuscripts last year in the monastery on Mt. Sinai and in the patriarchates of Jerusalem and the proposed continuation qf the project in Greece will make available to textual students a world of new material, enough to keep scholars busy for another generation. Then there is the com- prehensive study of New Testament texts being carried on cooiperatively by a group of New Testament scholars from different institutions. The biblical instructor can hardly be expected to keep up with the details ofall that is going on; but he should be able to take notice of the principal findings. Then there is archaeology. It is trite to say that archaeology since World War I has revo- lutionized our knowledge of the Bible; but</page><page sequence="5">NEW PROBLEMS FOR THE BIBLICAL INSTRUCTOR 117 the Bible teacher who takes no notice of the archaeological developments is missing an es- sential part of Bible study. Archaeology has not only identified a great number of Bible sites; it has taught us a great deal about the people of the Holy Land in Bible times. It has added authenticity to the patriarchal narratives, shown us public and private houses in Israelite towns, and produced innumerable objects that were part of the lives of Hebrews, Jews, and early Christians. It has brought to light stables and smelter of King Solomon, the palaces of Omri and Ahab, written documents from the time of Jeremiah, evidence of the devastation of the land by Nebuchadnezzar, fortresses of the Maccabees, coins of the Ptolemies and Seleucids, Jewish and early Christian cata- combs, and the jars, pots, dishes, and lamps that were household utensils from the time of Abraham to the present day. Archaeology makes vivid the Psalmist's words, "Thou shalt break them in pieces like a potter's vessel." Connected with archaeology is the new knowledge that is available through the study of cognate languages. The archaeologists dig up the tablets which the philologists decipher and translate. At the beginning of the century there were scholars able to read the inscrip- tions of Egypt, Persia, Assyria, and Babylonia. During World War I there was announced the decipherment of the Hittite cuneiform. Since then there have been marked advances in the translation of Elamite, Hurrian, Sumerian, and Hittite hieroglyphic. Almost every new exca- vation turns up some new inscriptions and many of these inscriptions help in the under- standing of the Bible. Thanks to those who patiently have been working on these old docu- ments we now know that the Hittites were not merely a small group of Canaanites in Pales- tine before the coming of the Israelites, as our fathers were taught and as some of us were taught in our student days; we know why Rachel stole her father's teraphim when she fled from the land of Haran with Jacob; and why Sarah was able to compel Abraham to send Hagar and Ishmael into the wilderness. We know also that Cyrus' return of the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple at Jerusalem was part of his program to gain good will of his new subjects by re- turning to the various cities their images which had been concentrated in Babylon. Perhaps the most revolutionary addition to our understanding of the Bible by way of the study of a cognate language comes from the Ugaritic. Scarcely twenty years ago a few scholars were beginning to decipher the tablets in a hitherto unknown cuneiform alphabet which had come to light in the ancient Ugarit, now known by the Arabic name Ras Shamra. The language, called by some Ugaritic and by some Canaanite, is a good deal like biblical Hebrew. There are differences of opinion among the scholars who are working with the Ugaritic documents; but there is no doubt about a number of findings important to the Bible student. A number of words hitherto known only in the Priestly document, and therefore considered postexilic, now appear in the Uga- ritic before the birth of the nation Israel. The puzzling mention of Daniel by Ezekiel, when the Daniel that we knew was a very young man at the time of Ezekiel, is clarified by the find- ing of a Canaanite hero by the same name, one of the principal characters in a long poem. Patterns of Hebrew poetry found in the Bible are found also in the poems of Ras Shamra. Some of the Psalms, the 29th for instance, seem to be taken over bodily from the Ugaritic with the substitution of Yahweh for Baal. This does not mean that the Israelite religion was merely a development from the crassly polytheistic Canaanite religion; but it is interesting to note the cultural influence of the Canaanites on the Israelites, an influence frequently bringing with it the idolatry which the prophets con- stantly denounced. Still another matter of lan- guage confronts the biblical instructor. The revival of the Hebrew language in Palestine and the flood of scholarly publications now coming from the presses in the State of Israel seems likely to make it imperative that in order to keep up with important studies relat- ing to the Bible and the Holy Land the scholar</page><page sequence="6">118 0. R. SELLERS must be able to read modern Hebrew as well as German and French. III With all this new archaeological and lin- guistic knowledge which the biblical instructor should take into account there has come a re- vived interest in theology. The old idea that the religion of the Israelites came by a natural development from a primitive animism and fetishism through theriomorphic polytheism, therianthropic polytheism, anthropomorphic polytheism, henotheism, and monotheism until its culmination in the life and teaching of Christ has been challenged. That there was development is not denied, but the gospel which Jesus proclaimed cannot be explained by natural development any more than can the beginnings of life, consciousness, and conscience be explained by biological evolution. So the theologians are interested in pointing out the work of God in the formation of the Bible. The Bible is valuable, some of them say, be- cause it shows what man will do when he is confronted by God. While they insist on the validity of historical and textual study, they seem at times to ignore the results of such study when they write their books and articles. They are accused of taking the parts of the Bible which support their theories, rejecting the other parts, and then presenting their teachings as biblical theology. Still we can thank these theologians for arousing new interest and their calling atten- tion to the sterility and ineffectiveness of much of the critical study of the past. We were prone to think we had done our duty when we fixed the historical setting of a Psalm or traced the history of a word or offered a textual emendation which would give meaning to an obscure passage. Now we are reminded that such studies, useful though they may be, are not enough. A knowledge of the political his- tory of Israel, the principles of Hebrew poetry, the events in the life of Christ, and the mis- sionary journeys of Paul is essential to the understanding of the Bible; but the mere learn- ing of these things is of little value unless they have some effect on the attitudes of the stu- dent. The temptation to the biblical theologian is to theologize without knowing his sources and the temptation to the historical and liter- ary critic of the Bible is to catalog happenings or to analyze literary devices without showing any cause for concern about them. Now we can hope that there will be theological studies by scholars well grounded in their understanding of the Old Testament and the New Testament. Some such scholars are working now and their output may have a salutary influence on the rising generation. IV Today I can see an urgency in our task. On many sides we hear the lament that the tremendous advance in science has been ac- companied by no corresponding advance in our spiritual life. The world today is in such confusion and anxiety as were not known by our fathers or by us before the last year. It may be said of us as the psalmist said of his contemporaries, "If the foundations be re- moved the righteous-what has he done?" Some of us have dug in the remains of old cities, built by happy people who thought they were quiet and secure but were overrun by conquerors who destroyed their palaces and took them into slavery. Many times the little land of Palestine has been devastated and its people scattered; but the spark of faith which was held by the people who produced the Bible and kept it as their sacred book has guar- anteed their survival. The teachings contained in the Bible have guided through the ages the men and women through whom have come the good features in our modern civilization. Through arrogance, ambition, selfishness, and pride, which are contrary to the biblical pre- cepts, have come the wars and oppressions which are responsible for the world's misery. It is incumbent on us to proclaim this to all whom we have the opportunity to teach. We should be honest about the Bible and admit the presence in it of passages that we cannot understand; but unless we believe the Bible in</page><page sequence="7">NEW PROBLEMS FOR THE BIBLICAL INSTRUCTOR 119 a unique sense to be the Word of God we might as well be following some more lucra- tive calling. We should know the Bible, un- derstand it, and be convinced of its relevance. V The biblical instructor today has a large responsibility. There are encroachments by the secular subjects and even by those designated teachers of religion who would minimize the time given to the study of the Bible. Last week a student came to my office to complain about the time that he had to use in the preparation for a Bible examination. He came from a Christian home; in college he was a leader in a church organization; he was sure of his voca- tion as a minister. I told him that if he became a successful pastor he would have to work harder than he was working in the seminary. "Oh," he said, "but then I shall be working with people." I believe that like him many students think that the Bible has nothing to do with human relations. We have the problem of making them see that our subject is important. Gilbert Highet, in his excellent book, The Art of Teaching, names three essentials of good teaching: (1) The teacher must know the sub- ject and this means that he must continue to learn it. (2) He must like it. Unless he does, he is a hypocrite and his students soon will dis- cover his hypocrisy. (3) He must like his pupils. Highet points out some techniques by which the teacher can arouse the interest of his pu- pils. The biblical instructor will do well to make his courses interesting. If in his institution courses in the Bible are elective he must at- tract pupils into his classes. If the courses are required he must win the students who take them under protest. One of the reasons for this organization is the opportunity to share our experiences, our successes and our failures, and thereby learn to improve our teaching. In conclusion, I am sure that the teaching of the Bible has improved in our generation; the task of the biblical instructor is more com- plicated and demanding than it was in the past; and we have an opportunity to interest and start in their training young students who will appreciate the Bible and some of whom as scholars and teachers will surpass us.</page></plain_text>
