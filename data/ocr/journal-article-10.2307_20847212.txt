<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTROVERSY OVER AL-MAQ?M AL-MAHM?D DR. ZIAUDDIN AHMED Under the part : Fadail al-Nabiyy of al-Musnad min Masa il Ahmad b. Hanbai,1 an encyclopaedic collection by Ab? Bakr al-Khall?l (d. 311/923-4) of the former's views on dogmatic controversies, we notice a long section (PP. 60?99) entitled Dhikr al-Maq?m al-Mabm?d. This refers to the verse : uu ?Cj o? ^ , ? Soon will thy Lord raise thee to a station of praise and glory.'2 The Qur'?n exegetes almost unanimously hold al Maq?m al-Mabm?d* to mean metaphorically ' Maq?m al-Shaf?' al-Kubra, a sphere where the Prophet would have the honour of universal intercession for his Umma on the Day of Resurrec tion. But certain Traditions (not from the Prophet), especially those ascribed to Muj?hid, a Tabi'?, interpret r1^1 as the Throne of God ('Arsh) on which the Prophet would be seated beside God on the Day of Resurrection.3 This is clearly an anthropomorphic version, and is unacceptable particularly to the Mu'tazila. The Hanbal?s who were latterly called Hashwiya, and sometimes Mujassima4 would inevitably oppose the Mutazila. So far as it may be surmised from the section referred to above, it appears that a serious controversy was in progress between the upholders of the above-mentioned two theories regarding al-Maq?m al-Mabm?d. It also seems that after the death of Ibn Hanbal the problem of al-Maq?mal Mabm?d became a much disputed quarrel between his followers and a certain ' Trimidh? who opposed their interpretation of the</page><page sequence="2">114 DR. ZIAUDDIN AHMAD above verse. Ibn Hanbal himself, however, does not appear to have had any part in this controversy, except that his general inclination was to take such verses in their literal sense. According to the historian al-Dhahab?, when certain 'Ahi al-Kal?rr? opposed the theory of Prophet's sitting with God, Ab? Bakr al-Marr?dhi (d. 272), an immediate disciple of Ibn Hanbal, rose to the occasion and composed a booklet which contained all the chains of authorities through which the tradition of Sitting was transmitted down.5 But, to al-Dhahab? who himself was a Hanabli, the traditions put forward in support of this theory were all unfounded.6 al-Khall?l says that he had the opportunity of learning the traditions related to ' al-Maq?m al-Mabm?d ' from its compiler al-Marr?dh?. But the latter's death did not allow the former to put the traditions in writing. However, in the year 292 A.H., while at Tars?s, al-Khall?l saw some disciples of the said Tirmidh? preaching the opinion of their master regarding al-Maq?m al-Mabm?d. Then al-Khall?l wrote to the Shuy?kh of Baghd?d for communicating to him their opinions about the interpretation of al- Maq?m al-Mabm?d. In response to this, a booklet was compiled and sent to al-Khall?l, which he not only read before his pupils, but also incorporated in his work al-Musnad min Masa il Abmad h. Hanbal.1 This booklet, which contains the reactions of the then Hanbal?s towards Tirmidh?, is probably sufficient to represent their attitude towards their opponents as well. In their opinion, Tirmidh? was a Jahmi ; he who denied a merit (Fadl) to the Prophet was a K?fir or a Zindiq and liable to be killed ; Tir midh? neither had any knowledge of traditions nor did he ever lived in company with the traditionists ; he was not to be bur ied in the graveyard of the Muslims.8</page><page sequence="3">AL-MAQAM-AL-MAHMUD 115 It also seems that in consequence of a social ostracism, Tirmidh? was debarred from entering the mosques. He also appears to have had some involvement in political activities. He might have followers among the H?shmites, as some of the versions testify. According to him, the allegiance paid to Ab? Muslim, who was responsible for the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate, was more valid than that paid to Aba Bakr. Tirmidh? is alleged to have compiled a book in which he asserted that Ali had better claim than Abu Bakr to the Caliphate.9 Now it remains to be seen who was al-KhallaPs ' al Tirmidh' or al-Dhahabi's 'ahi al-Kal?m\ Inspite of our utmost effort, it is not possible to identify al-Tirmidht. In his K. aWUluw, al-Dhahabi, while quoting an extract from the chapter of al-Maq?m al-Mabm?d in the above work ' al Musnad also mentions his Nasab only.10 According to some reliable information, however, there seem to have been some curious resemblances between the opinions of al-Tirmidhi and that of the historian al-Tabari who died in 310 A.H. Al-Tabari is said to have held the theory of Prophet's sitting with God on the ' Arsh as baseless.11 al though in his Tafsir he quoted many Traditions on the divergent opinions in the interpretation of the verse concerned. However, he himself considered the interpretation of al-Shaf a' al-Kubra more acceptable than that of the Sitting.12 It is said that al-Tabari incurred great enmity from the contemporacy Hanbal?s for regarding Ibn H?anbal as a tradi tionist, and not as a Faqih. On being asked by some Hanbali s about the theory of Prophet's sitting with God, al-Tabari recited :</page><page sequence="4">116 AL-MAQAM-AL-MAHMUD "Glory be to Him who has no companion, nor any one to sit beside Him on His Throne." Thereupon the Hanbalis became very angry, stoned his house and asked the people not to associate with him.13 It is also said that the ?anbal?s prevented his burial at day time. As a result he had to be interred at night. The Hanbal?s aslo accused him of Ra?. Al-Tab?ri is quoted as having compiled a book containing the Shi'ite traditions of Ghadir Khumm and 7V*r.14 NO TES 1.
