<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C H A P T E R  5 Chaos as Dialectic:  Stanislaw Lem and  the Space of Writing t a n i s l a w  Le m  has a formidable range of interests. Trained as a  Sphysician, he is seriously interested in mathematics, has taught  himself cybernetics, possesses a good working knowledge of biology,  knows quite a lot about cosmology, has read extensively in critical  theory and philosophy, and writes in Polish, German, and English.  The one thing he seems not to know is chaos theory— at least not in  the explicit forms discussed earlier, in which chaos is identified with  a new set of paradigms. When Lem writes about chaos, he under- stands it in the older sense of chance, randomness, disorder.  Through his reading in cybernetics, he has had ample opportunity to  learn about the principle of self-organization that underlies Pri-  gogine’s work. However, he has not published anything to date that  would indicate he has read Prigogine or knows about applications of  the idea of self-organization to chaotic systems. Yet chaos is a topic of almost obsessive interest for Lem. His writ- ing suggests that he considers accounting for randomness and disor- der perhaps the most important issue in twentieth-century thought.  Influenced both by his scientific training and by poststructuralism,  he is concerned with the interaction between something and nothing  as they collaborate to form human meanings. His fascination with  disorder, his wide reading in cybernetics, and the influence of post- a i </page> <page sequence="2"> i  16 Something out of Nothing modern fiction and literary theory have led him to an idiosyncratic  blending of some of the same elements that are evident in chaos  theory, although the patterns he weaves and the conclusions he  draws are uniquely his own. In a sense, he partakes of the foment  that led to chaos theory without participating in the paradigm. Whereas chaos theory identifies a new kind of orderly disorder,  Lem sees order and disorder as bound together in a dialectic that  enfolds them into each other while still permitting each to retain its  distinct identity. Where Prigogine sees the void as a fecund space of  creation, Lem envisions it as interpenetrating the apparent fullness  of the world, rendering signification problematic and certainty im- possible. When Lem’s work is seen in the context of chaos theory, it  suggests that when certain concepts become highly charged, they  will appear in various combinations throughout the culture, not only  in the authorized versions that crystallize around new paradigms. Few writers speak as much about their own and others’ works as  Lem. His interviews, personal essays, critiques of science fiction,  philosophical treatises on language, and sweeping attempts to cate- gorize modern fiction testify to his continuing fascination with the  processes and products of writing. In this writing about writing,  there is a curious division between process and product— between  the way Lem talks about the creation of texts and the way he thinks  about fictional works, including his own, once they have been writ- ten. Many writers experience a split between the creator and the  censor, the intuitive self who experiences writing as subjective cre- ation and the analytical self who stands back from what has been  written to revise and reshape the material. But for Lem the division  is more radical; creator and censor do not operate within the same  space. This does not mean, however, that the dialectic between them  is unimportant. It is invisible precisely because it is so important.  Displaced from direct articulation, it is the ground from which artic- ulation emerges. The ratiocinative side of the dialectic is most apparent in Lem’s  critiques of modern fiction, especially science fiction. Typically he  summarizes the plot, identifies the basic ideas, and then shows that  they are self-contradictory or incompatible with known facts. The  inevitable conclusion is that the work is “twaddle” because it does </page> <page sequence="3"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem i i j not satisfy these demands.1 Although most of these critiques are di- rected at the work of other authors, his own books are not exempt  from scrutiny. He has repeatedly dismissed his early works as flawed  or “purely secondary” because the ideas they embody seem to him  deficient (1984:93). From such analyses, one might well conclude  that for Lem, the cognitive structure of a work is the work. His speculations on the theoretical possibilities open to contem- porary writers do nothing to dispel this impression. The strategy he  follows in “Metafantasia: The Possibilities of Science Fiction”  (1981) is typical. First he gives examples of various kinds of ideas a  writer might use as a basis for a story. Then he criticizes the ideas  according to their value as rational hypotheses, implying that the  bolder and more consistent the hypothesis, the better the work that  embodies it. Since it is easy to recognize among these “hypothetical”  possibilities ones that he has in fact used in various fictions, it is  tempting to conclude that when he writes, he begins with an idea  that has been carefully thought out and tested for rational consis- tency and then proceeds to invent fictional situations that will work  out its implications. According to his own testimony, however, this is far from the  case. “Nothing I’ve ever written,” he states, “was planned in an ab- stract form right from the start, to be embodied later in literary  form.” 2 Moreover, the works that had relatively more planning he  regards as his worst, novels that he acknowledges as his own “only  with some discomfort” . With the books that he believes are success- ful, he confesses to have “found [himself], during the writing pro- cess, in the position of a reader,” as uncertain about what would  happen next as if someone else were the author. “Considering my- self to be a rationalist, I dislike such confessions,” he admits; “I  should prefer to be able to say that I knew everything I was doing—  or, at least, a good deal of it— beforehand” (1984:94). The division between his intuitive method of writing and the ana- lytical rigor of his writing about writing has deep roots in his past. 'Lem, 19713:322. See also Lem, 1974a. 2For further testimony on Lem’s wariness about planning his works in advance,  see Istvan Csicsery-Ronay’s “Twenty-two Answers and Two Postscripts: An Inter- view with Stanislaw Lem,” Science-Fiction Studies 13 (November 1986): 2 4 2 -2 6 0 . </page> <page sequence="4"> i i 8 Something out of Nothing In an autobiographical essay titled “Chance and Order” (1984) he  speaks of the radical break that occurred in his life when his privi- leged and secure childhood in the Ukraine was disrupted by the cata- clysmic upheavals of World War II. His life broke in two. On one  side was a childhood in which he “lacked nothing,” indulged by a  “respected and rather wealthy” father (p. 88); on the other side was  his life during and after the war, in which he “resembled a hunted  animal more than a thinking human being” (p. 90). In the first pe- riod, life was stable, rational, predictable, but isolated within the  closed structure of a family whose affluence made it an enclave  within an impoverished and threatened country; after the break, life  was unstable, irrational, and unpredictable, but open to the excite- ment of the streets and the dangers of chance. “I was able to learn  from hard experience that the difference between life and death de- pended upon minuscule, seemingly unimportant things and the  smallest of decisions: whether one chose this or that street for going  to work . . . whether one found a door open or closed” (p. 90). The  image of the open door is significant. His response was not to mini- mize danger but, in some instances, to court it. He recounts inci- dents when he deliberately exposed himself to risk, as if to test his  ability to survive in a world of chance. The relation of these experiences to his divided response toward  writing was apparently forged during the transition between the two  phases. Recalling his earliest writing, in which he would “transport  [himself] into fictitious worlds,” he emphasizes that he did not “in- vent or imagine them in a direct way. Rather, I fabricated masses of  important documents when I was in high school in Lvov: certifi- cates; passports; diplomas . . . permits and coded proofs and crypto- grams testifying to the highest rank— all in some other place, in a  country not to be found on any map.” Wondering if he invented  these documents to assuage an “unconscious feeling of danger,” he  concludes that “I know nothing of any such cause.” Yet the fact  remains that at this critical juncture, when the order of his early life  was threatened by events beyond his control, he turned to the inven- tion of texts as a way to create a space that would be open to uncer- tainty and danger, but within which he would be protected by the  “full power of authority.” It is no exaggeration to say, as he does,  that the two opposed principles of chance and order “guide my pen” </page> <page sequence="5"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem 119 (p. 88). Indeed, one might conclude that it is this dialectic that put  the pen into his hand.3 For Lem, writing creates a mediating space in which openness and  closure, chaos and order, creation and ratiocination engage each  other in a self-renewing and multilayered dialectic. When writing is  in progress, the emphasis is on the open-endedness of the process—  anything may happen, infinite possibilities lie open to the creator,  chance fluctuations create situations whose outcomes cannot be  foreseen. But this openness also undermines authority, putting the  writer uin the position of a reader,” subject to vicissitudes he cannot  control (1984:94). He can reassert order by writing about writing,  creating documents whose purpose is not primarily creation but reg- ulation (recall the passports, diplomas, certificates that were among  Lem’s earliest creations). In this writing about writing, possibilities  are enumerated only to be evaluated by the rational faculty and, as  often as not, dismissed. Because writing about writing unfolds in a  separate space from writing as such, the dialectic that engages the  creative and ratiocinative self is displaced from direct articulation.  On this level, there appears to be simply a dichotomy, rather than a  dialectic, between the two modes. The dialectic begins to come into sight when we view both the  writing and the writing about writing as, after all, writing. When  writing is ongoing, it creates an open space rich with latent, unar- ticulated possibilities. Yet writing, especially successful writing, pro- duces products—pages, drafts, texts, books. Once these products ex- ist, the space has been closed, the order of the words stabilized. How  to maintain the tension between chance and order which is for Lem  the condition of writing, even though the writing itself has ceased?  In his writing about writing, he suggests a host of possibilities— for  example, interspersing random “noise” throughout the text so that  one can never be sure what is message, what chance. “If we posit  that the task of literature is not to ever give a definitive explanation  of what it presents, and is therefore to affirm the autonomy of cer- 3The conjunction of World War II and Lem’s fascination with chance suggests that  the upheavals of World War II may have been important factors in focusing the  attention of that generation on chance. The war effort was intimately bound up with  the development of information theory, which was created in part to control chance  situations. </page> <page sequence="6"> n o  Something out of Nothing tain enigmas rather than to enter into explanations, then the most  engimatic of possible secrets is a purely random series” (1981:65).  Here the value of chaos for Lem becomes clear; it allows literature  to elude criticism’s attempt to close the space of writing. Yet in an- other sense, in this passage he is in fact attempting the “definitive  explanation” that he hopes chaos can defeat. Driven or led to ra- tiocination, he yearns to create a chaos that can defeat explanation;  faced with chaos, he cannot resist entering into explanations. The  effect of these convoluted crossings within the space of writing is to  create a dialectic that ceaselessly renews itself, wresting rational ex- planations from the enigmatic silence of the text even as it opens  fissures within the text which subvert those same explanations.4 In Lem’s view, the dialectic between chaos and order occupies a  central place in all writing. Far from seeing it as an idiosyncrasy  peculiar to him, he believes it is intrinsic to language. On the one  hand, language is “the instrument of description,” operating to  bring order and stability to perception; on the other hand, it is “also  the creator of what it describes,” caught in a self-referential loop  whose lack of ground leads to radical indeterminacy (1981:62). Lem  is of course not alone in emphasizing the self-referentiality of lan- guage. Julia Kristeva sums up the spirit of a generation when she  writes about the “theoretical ebullience” of criticism following its  “discovery of the determinative role of language in all human sci- ences” (i98o:vii). Yet there are important differences between post- structuralists such as Kristeva and Lem’s version of that “theoretical  ebullience.” While he would agree with Kristeva about the impor- tance of language in the construction of culture, he is also interested  in informational markers that distinguish between description and  creation. He believes, in other words, that language can be referen- tial as well as self-referential. Because creation through language is  for him a double act, transforming stochastic process into ordered  text and textual order into chance events, his writing has affinities  with poststructuralism but is perhaps distinct from it in its insistence  on the continuing tension inherent in the dialectic. Acknowledging  the void, he also posits a “somethingness” that remains apart from  the postmodern vacuum. 4Frank Occhiogrosso, 1980, discusses Lem’s The Investigation as an example of a  permanent enigma. </page> <page sequence="7"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem i z i In addition to his view that language “always has meanings ori- ented toward the world of real objects” (i973b:26), Lem is distin- guished from other poststructuralists by his belief that literature  must be about something other than textuality if it is to engage ethi- cal questions. The disappearance of “conventional structures of ethi- cal judgment all over the planet” is in his view profoundly bound up  with the kind of space in which the modern writer works (1981:61).  In “Metafantasia” he argues that the energy for literary creation has  historically come from the writer’s resistance to conventional ethics.  If there are no conventional ethics, the writer faces a very different  kind of problem: he or she must then create out of a void. The  erosion of traditional values has turned the writer’s task on its head.  The contemporary writer must invent, as well as overcome, the resis- tances on which writing depends. He must (like Lem) conceive of  writing as a double act, at once introducing the constraints that will  carve a defined space out of the void and opening fissures within it  which will protect the space from oppressive closure. The metaphoric interplay between enclosed and open spaces is  thus central to Lem’s thought, whether the subject is culture, ethics,  or language.5 The project of his writing is to define a space that is  neither full nor void, excessively cluttered nor empty, because these  extremes threaten to destroy writing. Nevertheless, it is only by ar- ticulating the extremes that one can create the space of writing, for  they are the boundaries that delineate it. In the face of this double  jeopardy, Lem’s characteristic response is to turn the extremes back  on themselves. By enfolding openness into closure, chance into ne- cessity, excessive information into empty language, his writing cre- ates a space that seems to exist apart from the boundaries that bring  it into existence. Without the dialectic the space of writing as he  envisions it could not exist, for in a very real sense the dialectic is  that space. The words on the page are the visible trace that the dia- lectic leaves behind. But for him the dialectic “guid[ing his] pen” is  writing-in-itself. The operation of the dialectic can be illustrated through two rep- resentative works, The Cyberiad (1974b) and His Master’s Voice 5Jerzy Jarzebski also comments on the marked division between Lem’s rationalism  and his “special inclination for phantasmagoric visions,” a dichotomy that Jarzebski  suggests can be modeled through “open and closed space” (1977:123). I am in- debted throughout this chapter to Jarzebski’s insights. </page> <page sequence="8"> J22 Something out of Nothing (1983). The Cyberiad is a collection of cybernetic fairy tales written  in a grotesque mode. His Master's Voice is a psychologically realistic  novel that is arguably the best of Lem’s serious fiction. Operating  within different generic conventions, the two texts are not so much  opposites as mirror reflections of each other. The same dialectic is at  work in both, although it proceeds in opposite directions. Consider first The Cyberiad. The stories in this collection are  noteworthy for their absence of a reality principle. Any idea, no  matter how absurd, can be used if it can be put into words. How  does one materialize a dragon? By amplifying its probability. How  does one answer ultimate questions about the meaning of life? By  building a Gnostotron that knows everything. Creation takes place  because the appropriate words exist or can be invented, not because  objects to which the words refer exist. In view of this linguistic zani- ness, it is hardly surprising that the central problem in The Cyberiad  is how to create something from nothing. When everything is possi- ble, the urgency of generating internal constraints is especially press- ing. His Master's Voice, by contrast, unfolds as the autobiography (or  “antibiography”) of the preeminent mathematician Peter Hogarth.  As its foregrounding of science suggests, His Master's Voice has a  much firmer internal reality principle than The Cyberiad. Along  with this difference in initial assumptions goes a corresponding dif- ference in goals. Characters in His Master's Voice are concerned not  with creating from the void but with determining the status of some- thing that has emerged from the void. This is one of the cases where  Lem’s “hypothetical” suggestions “retrodict” books he has already  written, for the neutrino transmission (the voice of the title) is so  densely coded with information that it is virtually indistinguishable  from noise. For the characters as well as the reader, the transmission  represents a permanent enigma (about which Lem had speculated in  “Metafantasia”). As a result, the claustrophobic enclosures of the  text are opened to radical uncertainty.6 It is now possible to see how the two texts reflect and invert each 6Jarzebski (1977:122) comments on how marked Lem’s work as a whole is with a  sense of claustrophobia, “by the suspicion that the apparently limitless universe sur- rounding us is in reality a huge, misleading stage backdrop designed to fit our cogni- </page> <page sequence="9"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem J23 other’s assumptions in the mirror relation of their dialectics. The  emptiness of The Cyberiad is introduced as a premise, an absence of  originary essence, whereas the emptiness of His Master’s Voice is  presented as a conclusion, a result of informational excess. The Cy- beriad foregrounds the emergence of its language from the void, em- phasizing its creation ex rtihilo. It then introduces successive con- straints until ethical judgment finally becomes possible. His Master’s  Voice, by contrast, appears initially to validate its language as a ref- erential symbol system, locating its subject in reality rather than in  language. But this referentiality is decentered by the neutrino trans- mission, whose excessive signification gives rise to multiple (and  multiplying) interpretations. At first ethical judgment seems clear-  cut, even complacent. But by the end, judgment has been so contam- inated by hermeneutics that it is only by an act of faith that the  narrator can achieve any kind of closure at all. Beginning at opposite  ends of the open/closed spectrum, the dialectics meet in the middle.  Whether the text begins with order or chance, referentiality or self-  referentiality, by the end both polarities have been so enfolded into  each other through the operation of the dialectic that they are inex- tricable. Reinforcing this mirror relation are different stances toward the  language that creates and the language that describes. The Cyberiad  introduces semantic markers that distinguish between descriptive  and creative language by introducing a complex set of narrative/  frame distinctions. As its narrative structure grows increasingly hier- archical, ethical judgment emerges through implicit connections be- tween different narrative levels.7 In His Master’s Voice, the basis for  ethical judgment is articulated at the beginning but becomes pro- gressively more ambiguous as the narrator’s descriptions of his life,  scientific work, and colleagues engage each other in circular reason- ing that makes it impossible to contain cause and effect within a  logical hierarchy. Whereas in the grotesque work ethical judgment tive faculties, while the essence of things is hidden away somewhere else, behind the  stage.” When queried about the Jarzebski comment in the Csicsery-Ronay interview,  (see n. 3), Lem replied, “As for claustrophobia, I don’t feel any . . . but I can conjure  an aura of claustrophobia or agoraphobia, if needed, in my writing.” Whatever  Lem’s personal psychology, claustrophobia is a prominent feeling in his writing. 7For a different view, see John Rothfork, 1977. </page> <page sequence="10"> 124 Something out of Nothing emerges through the introduction of formal structure, in the serious  novel it grows more problematic as the initial regulating structures  prove insufficient to order the text. By the end of both texts, the  paradoxical configuration of the textual space renders ethical judg- ment both inescapable and irreducibly complex. The dialectic is already in operation at the beginning of The Cy-  beriad, when Trurl creates a machine that can make anything that  starts with n . To test it, Klapaucius asks it to make Nothing, where- upon the machine starts unmaking the world. This opening story  demonstrates how Lem’s dialectic simultaneously invents constraints  and deconstructs them. In construing “Nothing” as a substantive  noun that has positive being-in-the-world rather than negation de- scribing a lack of being, the creation machine performs a linguistic  sleight-of-hand that transforms the void into the full. At the same  time, to create this fullness the machine must deconstruct everything  in the world, thus turning it into a void. By enfolding the void and  the full into each other, this opening story creates through writing  the space of writing. Central to this paradoxical enfolding is the balance between cre- ation and destruction. To prove it can make anything that starts  with n , the machine must continue to make Nothing until it finally  deconstructs everything, including the constructors and itself. For- tunately, the constructors are able to deflect it from this course of  uncreation before deconstruction is complete. Some things still exist,  although the world remains “honeycombed with nothingness”  (1974b:8). The machine has operated long enough, however, to un- dermine the referentiality of language. For those objects it has de- constructed, only names remain to signify the resulting voids. “The  gruncheons, the targalisks, the shupops, the calinatifacts, the thists”  have all disappeared as objects in the world and remain only as signs  within the text (p. 6). The ontological security of realism has thus  been undercut, since language is revealed as an instrument of un- creation as well as of creation. However, to deconstruct everything  would be self-defeating, not least because for Lem creation depends  on a dialectic between something and nothing. If there were only the  void, creation would be impossible. In this just-so story explaining  how the world came to be as it is, the partly deconstructed universe  resembles a Swiss cheese, for within the heavens dotted with stars </page> <page sequence="11"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem i z $ gape holes left by the annihilated “worches and zits.” The universe  has become the space of writing, containing both self-reflexivity and  representation in its paradoxical configuration. Within the space opened by this initial writing the rest of the text  unfolds, evolving through a continuing textual interplay between  emptiness and excessiveness. In the story of the Multitudians, for  example, Lem imagines a culture in which numerosity is everything.  Only masses are valued, not single beings. The uses to which the  King of the Multitudians puts his subjects are significant. In an at- tempt to prove to Trurl the delights of numerosity, the King points  out that his subjects can literally be made into signs— living mosaics  “providing sentiments for every occasion” (1974^180-181). Trurl,  unimpressed, thinks to himself that “an overabundance of thinking  beings is a dangerous thing, if it reduces them to the status of sand”  (p. 180). The King’s suggestion that his subjects can be used rather  like Hallmark greeting cards links excessive numbers to a textuality  that empties the subject of its traditional humanistic content. In  Lem’s view, if language is empty, it cannot be used to express ethical  concerns. If the subject is empty, it cannot be used as a locus of  value. The planet of the Multitudians thus presents to the construc- tor the same erosion of traditional values that Lem sees as charac- teristic of the modern era.8 For Trurl, the problem is more practical than philosophical. Al- though he dislikes the King’s ethics, he dislikes still more his sugges- tion that Trurl accept “two or three hundred thousand” of his sub- jects as recompense for creating a Perfect Adviser (p. 180). Trurl  insists on gold, and the King reluctantly agrees. When the King later  attempts to defraud Trurl of his rightful payment, Trurl devises a  stratagem to make the King fall victim to the very superfluity of  signs that he tried to urge on Trurl. The stratagem is simplicity itself.  Trurl sends an innocuous letter to the Adviser, knowing that the  suspicious King will believe the letter is written in code. Because  there is no code, there are no constraints limiting interpretation, and  the King’s experts generate more and more possible messages from sRothfork (1981), discussing the ethical implications of “having everything,”  places Lem’s view of superfluity in the context of utilitarianism. </page> <page sequence="12"> i z 6  Something out of Nothing the letter. The King, having ignored ethical constraints in turning his  subjects into signs, is now confronted by a textual void opened by  the lack of constraints within TrurPs letter. Determined to arrive at a unitary meaning, the King calls in the  world’s “greatest expert in secret writing,” Professor Crusticus. The  professor, the “distinguished discoverer of invisible sign language,”  assures the King that he can find the text’s one true meaning. He  discovers that if he “added up all the letters of the letter, subtracted  the parallax of the sun plus the annual production of umbrellas, and  then took the cube root of the remainder,” he would have the an- swer. The King’s agents confirm the professor’s solution by torturing  the unfortunate citizen whose name is an anagram of it (p. 191).  What the professor’s solution exposes is not, of course, the putative  answer that the King seeks, but a moral of which the King remains  oblivious, although it is clear enough to the reader. Theories about  language which claim that it is free to be interpreted in any way  whatsoever are the allies and precursors of state terrorism. The connection between the textual politics of empty language  and political violence is underscored when Trurl too is ensnared  within the proliferating signs. By encoding the Adviser’s program  with his own wisdom, Trurl is put in the difficult position of “at- tempting to conquer himself, for the Adviser was, in a sense, a part  of him” (pp. 187-188). Trurl is vulnerable to even such an oaf as  the King because he has reduced his identity to a series of signs and  replicated them within the Adviser. If identity is merely a collection  of signs, capable of dissemination through multiple cybernetic texts  (a possibility explored at length in “The Mischief of King Balerion,”  another story in The Cyberiad), then on what basis can human  rights, which rest on the sanctity and uniqueness of the individual,  be justified? The question is at the center of this text, as it attempts  to construct spaces in which the chaotic superfluities of disseminat- ing acts and words are balanced against the oppressively closed  structures of tyranny. When the balance shifts too far in either direc- tion, the results are invariably disastrous. The potential for violence that opening identity to dissemination  can unleash is brought forcibly home for Trurl in “A Good Shellack- ing.” In this story, Trurl attempts to trick his fellow constructor,  Klapaucius, by passing himself off as “a Trurl,” a copy of himself </page> <page sequence="13"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem 127 which his marvelous “Machine to Grant Every Wish” has created.  Taking the “copy” at its word, Klapaucius locks it in the basement  and starts to beat it. Trurl howls in protest, but Klapaucius insists  that he has every right to use Trurl as he pleases, since he is only a  copy, not the real Trurl. Finally Trurl escapes and, when Klapaucius  calls the next day, tells him that he was forced to dismantle the false  Trurl because it defamed his good friend Klapaucius. The shrewd  Klapaucius knows perfectly well, of course, that there never was a  copy. What Trurl has dismantled is a sign, not a physical object. When the copy is a cybernetic organism rather than a sign, the  problems caused by proliferating identities are not so easily solved.  Significantly, when Lem’s characters are confronted with the per- plexing issue of distinguishing between an original and a created  self, they often find themselves unable to impose any ethical solution  upon the situation. In “How Trurl’s Perfection Led to No Good,”  for example, Trurl creates a miniature kingdom in a box and peo- ples it with tiny beings as a toy for the tyrant Excelsius. When Trurl  returns home, Klapaucius points out to him with horror that be- cause the creatures Trurl has made are in every way indistinguish- able from real beings, they are real: a “sufferer is one who behaves  like a sufferer” (p. 169). Because of Trurl, living creatures who are  trapped within the box are entirely at the mercy of Excelsius. Mean- ing only to placate Excelsius, Trurl has condemned them to a living  hell. Creating the box was clearly a mistake; how to correct the  error? Destroy the box? Professor Dobbs, encountering similar diffi- culties in “Non Servium” (in A Perfect Vacuum , 1971b), finally de- cides that he has no ethical options. The best he can do is to delay  for as long as possible throwing the switch that will kill his artificial  beings. Trurl’s dilemma has a happier outcome, for when he returns to  the kingdom-in-a-box, he finds that the miniature beings have es- caped their enclosure and turned the tables on their tyrannical ruler,  exiling Excelsius to the void. Clearly a startling reversal has taken  place, for one of the text’s most claustrophobic and tyrannically op- pressive enclosures has been opened, while the tyrant has been trans- formed into a rather picturesque moon. How did this marvel occur?  Although no explicit explanation is given, there are hints that it  comes about because the inhabitants of the box are capable of self- </page> <page sequence="14"> i z 8  Something out of Nothing organizing processes. If ethical solutions cannot be imposed from  without, perhaps they can arise from within. This conclusion paves the way for the reemergence of ethics from  the space of writing. While the stories have been showing various  kinds of self-organizing processes in action within the narratives, the  narrative space itself has grown increasingly complex and hence sus- ceptible to self-organization in its own right. In Lem’s view, litera- ture— indeed, language itself— is engaged in a feedback loop in  which articulating an idea changes the context, and changing the  context affects the way the idea is understood, which in its turn  leads to another idea, so that text and context evolve together in a  constantly modulating interaction. Regulating structures provide a  way to control this interaction and use it constructively. In general, the hierarchical structures characteristic of self-regulat-  ing systems evolve because they are necessary, and they are neces- sary because they introduce the constraints that bring feedback  loops under control by partially “insulating” the changes going on  at one level from those at another. How these self-organizing pro- cesses occur is illustrated through the increasing complexity of The  Cyberiad's narrative structure. From the first story on, feedback  loops are created which enfold the narrative space into itself. Conse- quently, as the stories progress, the space becomes more and more  convoluted. By the “King Genius” story, no fewer than three distinct  narrative frames are employed, with as many as fifteen stories nested  inside a single frame. The structure implies that the narrative/frame  hierarchies must be this complex to control the proliferating narra- tives. At the same time, the greater complexity leads to the possi- bility of multiple interactions between levels, so that the space is  opened to narrative proliferation again. As chaos leads to order, and  order back to chaos, the narrative comes to resemble an organism  that grows by periodically dissolving and reassembling, each time at  a higher level of complexity. In this sense the narrative is a cyberne- tic organism, manifesting within itself the same self-organizing pro- cesses that the stories take as their subject.9 It is this self-organization that allows ethical judgment to be in- 9For a subtle analysis of how Lem’s novels in general become “cybernetic,” see  Robert M. Philmus, 1986. </page> <page sequence="15"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem i z y trinsic to the space of writing, emerging from within rather than  imposed from without. As the text undergoes periodic deconstruc- tion and reassembly, the feedback loops that originated the self-or- ganizing processes work to increase ethical awareness. In one of the  “King Genius” stories, for example, we are told about a book by  Chlorian Theoreticus the Proph titled The Evolution o f Reason as a  Two-Cycle Phenomenon. According to the Proph, robots and hu- mans are joined by a “reciprocal bond” of mutual creation (p.  244). First humans evolve and create robots. In time the humans die  out, and the Automatas, “having freed themselves from the Albu-  minids, eventually conduct experiments to see if consciousness can  subsist” in protein (p. 245). So the robots create “synthetic pale- faces,” who in turn eventually again make robots. Because the two  phases are bound together by a continually evolving feedback loop,  neither human nor robot can logically claim to be “original.” Con- versely, neither one is merely a copy to be used for another’s plea- sure. The scenario implies that in a cybernetic age, although neither  silicon mechanism nor protoplasmic organism has priority, both  have rights. The feedback loops that configure the space of writing  thus also serve as a model for ethical awareness. So complex are the multiple interactions between stories and be- tween different narrative levels within the same story that it would  take hundreds of pages to explicate fully the connections between  ethics and language which emerge in this little book. As an example  of this complexity, consider the “Doctrine of Inaction,” first pro- posed by King Genius, the auditor of Trurl’s stories. Reasoning that  if one cannot control all of the consequences of one’s actions, it is  better not to act at all, King Genius has abdicated his throne and  fallen into a deep depression from which only the most entertaining  stories can rouse him. In this context, the Doctrine of Inaction ap- pears as moral paralysis. “Inaction is certain, and that is all it has to  recommend it,” Trurl admonishes the King. Unlike the King, Trurl  favors action precisely because it is uncertain. “Therein lies its fas- cination,” he asserts (p. 177). Trurl’s judgment is not the last word  on the subject, however, as the subsequent story “Altruizine” makes  clear. In a different context, the uncertainty of proliferating actions  can be more devastating than the certainty of doing nothing. In “Altruizine,” Klapaucius moves out of the King Genius frame </page> <page sequence="16"> 130 Something out of Nothing to continue his quest for the perfect action inside another story told  by Bonhominus to Trurl. Bonhominus recounts how Klapaucius is  given altruizine by HPLDs, the beings who represent the Highest  Possible Level of Development. The HPLDs have been convinced,  through long and unhappy experience, that the only sound policy is  the Doctrine of Inaction. Consequently, they present altruizine to  Klapaucius by way of an object lesson. The drug has the peculiar  property of causing everyone to feel what everyone else in the imme- diate vicinity is experiencing. Klapaucius presents it in turn to Bon- hominus, who is convinced that he can use it to solve the world’s  ethical problems. He subsequently dumps it in a town’s water sup- ply. Without the controlling constraints imposed by hierarchical  structures, the feedback loops that the drug initiates quickly spiral  out of control. A man has a toothache, for example, and his neigh- bor runs screaming into the street. The chaos that Bonhominus  unleashes is linked through the feedback image with the relatively  simple narrative/frame structure that this story employs. The impli- cation is that ethical judgments appropriate to the convoluted space  of “King Genius” may not be appropriate to a space that is less  complex and hierarchical. The way the space of writing is config- ured is thus intimately bound up with the kind of ethical judgments  that are appropriate within it. The “something” that emerges from the void in The Cyberiad is  not, then, a general rule of conduct, but a dialectic that circles back  on itself to raise the level of ethical awareness, slowly and often  painfully. That there finally are no definitive answers is a foregone  conclusion, given the complexity and diversity of the ethical ques- tions that are posed. There are, however, correlations and symme- tries that reveal how language and ethics are interrelated. Ethical  awareness for Lem means being aware of these relations. By enfold- ing the full into the void, openness into closure, the dialectic has  caused ethical awareness to reemerge from the vacuum of a decon- structed world. His Master’s Voice is like The Cyberiad in its refusal to validate  ethical standards that hold true for any time, any place. The void  that this serious novel confronts, however, is essentially different  from the linguistic emptiness that underlies the grotesquerie of The </page> <page sequence="17"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem 131 Cyberiad, More committed to representational language, His Mas- ter's Voice is also more serious about creating psychologically plaus- ible characterizations. The void here has two loci: the deep vacuum  of space, from which the neutrino transmission emerges; and the  deep recesses of Peter Hogarth’s personality, from which the lan- guage that constitutes his narrative emerges. In Hogarth’s account as  well as in the letter from the stars, the dialectic operates to produce  out of a vacuum information so excessive that it finally cannot be  distinguished from emptiness. The problem, then, is not how to re- cuperate ethical judgment from the void, but how to protect it from  proliferating significations that threaten to bury it under their exces- siveness. The problem is introduced in Hogarth’s “Preface,” where he  breaks scientific decorum to tell his readers about the dark underside  of his public image. Calling his revelations an “antibiography” be- cause they conflict with the beneficent image his official biographers  have created (p. 18), Hogarth asserts that his dominant personality  traits are malice, cowardice, and pride (p. 16). The catalyzing event  that revealed him to himself was his mother’s death, which he wit- nessed as a child. Seeing her die slowly, agonizingly, he concluded  that evil was stronger than good. In that case, his cowardice  prompted him to side with maliciousness rather than benevolence.  As an adult, Hogarth attempts to construct a personality directly  opposite to these innate tendencies and so pardoxically reveals to  himself his last innate trait, pride (pp. 6—8). But then it occurs to him that death may be the work not of evil  but of chance: millions of chance accidents, chance misreadings in  the cells that accumulate as the years go on. He devotes his talent to  proving that chance has played a determining role in human nature.  “With the formulae of stochastics I strove to undo the evil spell” (p.  10). Now comes a subtle reversal. So successful is this brilliant  mathematician at his chosen task that chance is indeed established as  the determining factor in human evolution. Paradoxically, then,  chance no longer opposes necessity but becomes necessity. Thus a  new rebellion is necessary: “I know that Chance fashioned us, put us  together as we are— and what, am I to follow submissively all the  directives drawn blindly in that endless lottery?” (p. 18). If his in- </page> <page sequence="18"> 132. Something out ot Nothing nate personality is the result of chance, Hogarth will seek freedom  by fighting against this “endless lottery.” Thus he strives to become  what he naturally is not— benevolent, brave, humble. In Hogarth’s antibiography, a familiar pattern is at w ork.10 The  dialectic circles back on itself so that two opposites, chance and ne- cessity, are enfolded into one another. Whereas in The Cyberiad this  circling back caused ethics to emerge, in His Master's Voice it under- mines the initial clarity of Hogarth’s ethical judgments. For example,  what if someone were naturally good? Would it follow that to attain  freedom, he should strive to be evil? Though Hogarth poses the  question, he is unable to give a satisfactory answer. Once articu- lated, the dialectic seems to take on a life of its own and will con- tinue to dominate the events not only of Hogarth’s life but also of  humankind’s encounter with the letter from the stars. Ethical judg- ments that begin by being clear-cut become progressively ambiguous  as the dialectic proceeds.11 Already at work in Hogarth’s “Preface,” the dialectic continues to  enfold chance into necessity through the dramatic story of how the  “letter” is discovered. Swanson, a physicist who is part guru, part  scientist, hits upon the idea of using recordings of cosmic back- ground radiation to generate random number tables. Random num- bers are useful in scientific work because the sequences within them  manifest no consistent pattern; they may thus be used to simulate  chance events. A scientist using the random number tables discovers,  however, that sequences in the first volume are repeated in the sec- ond. Concluding that Swanson copied his results from the first vol- ume into the second rather than transcribing new radiation record- ings, he sues Swanson for fraud. But Swanson has not cheated.  Across a narrow band, the neutrino radiation does in fact repeat  itself about once every two days. This repetition is all that enables 10Hogarth’s circuitous reasoning in the “Preface” is strikingly parallel to that of  Jacques M onod in his Chance and Necessity  (1972). M onod’s account, like  Hogarth’s, emphasizes the interplay between chance permutations and genetic repli- cation in the evolutionary process. Published in France a year after His Master’s  Voice appeared in Poland, Chance and Necessity  is unlikely to have been a direct  influence on Lem, although M onod’s technical articles may well have been part of  Lem’s reading. In any case, M onod’s text provides a context that clarifies Lem’s  novel. 11 Edward Balcerzan, 1975, makes this point in a different context. </page> <page sequence="19"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem the radiation to be recognized as a message, for it is so densely  coded that in all other respects it is virtually indistinguishable from  noise. The government turns the investigation of the transmission  into a top-secret project— “His M aster’s Voice.” Despite the best efforts of the project’s scientists, they never dis- cover whether the radiation is in fact a letter from the stars, or in- deed if it is a message at all. Hogarth sees it as a “particularly com- plex Rorschach test” in which the scientists “attempt, behind the  veil of incomprehensible signs, to discern the presence of what lay,  first and foremost, within ourselves” (2:32). First seen as noise, then  as signal, the transmission also acts as a mirror, reflecting the sys- tematic misreadings of what Hogarth calls Earth’s “predatory” sci- ence (13:151). Almost alone among the scientists, Hogarth realizes that attempts  to interpret the letter can never escape the hermeneutic circle. The  reflexive nature of the project becomes apparent when an early deci- sion is made to use binary code. Later Hogarth notices tiny discrep- ancies in the transmission, so minute that they cannot be translated  into binary code. When his fellow scientists argue that the discrepan- cies represent a slight blurring of the transmission as it travels  through space, Hogarth proves that the transmission is accurate to  the limits of the recording instruments. The transmission’s code, in  other words, is not binary. But the scientists continue to act as if it  were, thus encoding their own assumptions into the presumed de- coding of the letter. Although Hogarth does not dwell on the matter,  the incident illustrates how chance enters into the translation and  becomes fossilized there as initial hypotheses become unexamined  premises. What the scientists see in the transmission, Hogarth more  than hints, is what they have projected onto it. The scientists are doomed to misunderstand because they can  never escape their anthropomorphic perspective, encoded not only  into the symbol systems but into the very structure of their brains. In  that case, the possibility arises that the mistranslations are in some  way systematic, not the work of chance but the necessary conse- quence of human brain structure and evolution. Since this evolution  itself originated in chance, however, there exists no possible filter by  which the systematic distortions of necessity can be separated from  the fortuitous operations of chance, even if one assumes that such a </page> <page sequence="20"> 134 Something out of Nothing transcendent, nonhuman viewpoint is possible. So Hogarth, and all  of the other scientists, are trapped in what he calls “carousellike”  reasoning (2:28) in which premises become conclusions and conclu- sions premises, chance necessity and necessity chance. Beginning  with chance, the dialectic moves toward necessity, then circles back  to enfold both within the same space. The dialectic is also at work within Hogarth’s interpretation of his  antibiography. Does he reveal the secrets of his private life to illumi- nate his actions in the project? Or does he undertake to write the  project’s history to indulge in narcissistic self-revelation? Recogniz- ing the possible circularity, he wants to believe that the “ugliness of  my malice I made public . . .  to divorce myself from it.” But suppose  that “by stealth, it penetrated, permeated my ‘good intentions’ and  all the time guided my pen. . . .  In this diametrically opposed view of  the matter, what I held to be an unpleasant necessity . . . becomes  the primary motive, while the subject itself— His Master’s Voice— is  a pretext that comes conveniently to hand” (2:28). In the same way  that chance and necessity are enfolded into the same space within  the antibiography, so these two texts are further enfolded into each  other as pretext becomes text, text pretext. The dialectic that Lem  saw “guidfing his] pen” applies as well to Hogarth and the narrative  spaces his writing creates. The dialectical circularity of the novel is reinforced by its post- humous status. Because Hogarth dies before his book is published, it  is the editor, Thomas Warren, who decides that the antibiography  will serve as preface rather than as epilogue to Hogarth’s account.  The arrangement implies, of course, that the scientific work grows  out of Hogarth’s interpretation of his life. A note from Warren ex- plaining why he chose to put the antibiography first makes us  aware, however, that the book could just as easily have been assem- bled the other way around. Is the order of the text finally deter- mined by necessity or by chance? We have no way to know, since  both text and pre-text have already been caught up in a circular  dialectic that makes it impossible to establish which came first. The dialectic circles endlessly because at the center of the text is a  permanent engima: the neutrino radiation. As long as the transmis- sion remains incomprehensible, neither Hogarth nor anyone else can  close the narrative space by showing which of the data fore- </page> <page sequence="21"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem J35 shadowed the known end. The transmission thus acts like a hole  puncturing the textual enclosure of the novel. Painfully aware of the  openness that this enigma introduces into his text, Hogarth attempts  to compensate by including as much as possible within his narrative.  “I do not know what it is among the people of the Project that  determined finally the Project’s fate,” he admits. “Therefore, just in  case, thinking of the future, I am also presenting here those bits and  pieces that I have not been able to put into any coherent whole.  Perhaps someone else, someday, will manage tha t” (4:57). The hope  is illusory, for as Hogarth himself acknowledges in his attempts to  decode the letter, it is impossible ever to describe anything com- pletely. Any description presupposes a frame of reference that limits,  even as it creates, what is said. The hope that a definitive reading may one day be possible, illu- sory though it is, impels Hogarth to write his antibiography and to  include in his account personal, often unflattering portraits of his  colleagues. How to locate in this complex space the relation between  cause and effect which readers ever since Artistotle have demanded  of fictions?12 The difficulty is not merely that Aristotelian assump- tions of unity do not apply. They also do not necessarily not apply,  for it may be that most, or even all, of the data are relevant. But we  have no way to know. Because the transmission remains an enigma,  it is impossible to read the text teleologically and consequently im- possible to distinguish chance events from necessary outcomes.13  There is no possibility for a definitive interpretation of the text,  whether the text is conceived as the neutrino transmission, H o- garth’s antibiography, Hogarth’s account of the project, Thomas  Warren’s edited text of Hogarth’s accounts, or the entirety that is  Stanislaw Lem’s novel. Against this background of pervasive uncertainty, a few known  quantities do emerge. Hogarth’s first and, as it turns out, only con- tribution toward decoding the transmission is to demonstrate that it  possesses a mathematically closed structure. It closes “like an object  separated from the rest of the world, or like a circular process,” 12For an example of a puzzled response to this lack of unity, see Peter S. Beagle,  1983. 13M onod discusses teleonomy in an argument that sets forth in biological terms  the same problems that Hogarth faces in shaping his text (1972:3-44). </page> <page sequence="22"> 136 Something out of Nothing Hogarth says, then adds, “to be more precise, like the d e s c r i p t i o n ,  the m o d e l  of such a thing” (6:86). It is possible to hear in  Hogarth’s language a nostalgic yearning for a lost world of un- problematic referentiality. By establishing that the letter possesses  formal properties of closure, Hogarth has indeed limited what it can  be. He succeeds in proving that it is a “description of a phenome- non” (6:88). But when the research teams assign stereochemical  meanings to the transmission’s symbols, the text is inevitably opened  again to chance. From these assigned meanings the scientists are able to construct a  physical substance. Whether this substance is what the letter was  meant to describe remains problematic, however, since there is no  way to be certain that the assigned meanings correlate with the let- ter’s symbols. The substance may be a correct materialization, or a  garbled distortion that reflects only the anthropomorphic biases of  its creators. The ambiguity is reinforced by the uncertain purposes to  which the substance might be put. Is it a miracle compound, reveal- ing secrets hitherto unknown to terrestrial science? Or is it a first  step in the Senders’ plan to take over the planet? The ambiguity is  encoded in the names the scientists choose for the substance. The  biophysicists call it “frog eggs” ; the biologists, “Lord of the Flies.”  Whether the substance is a tool for creation or destruction is as un- certain as whether it is the product of chance or design. A third known quantity emerges from the letter’s form, when it is  discovered that the radiation composing the transmission has pre- cisely the right range of frequencies to affect favorably the develop- ment of large protein molecules. If it had been present when Earth  was young, it would have significantly increased the chances that life  would evolve. It is, in other words, biophilic. Arguing from premises  familiar to literary critics, Hogarth believes that since the form  of  the letter is conducive to life, the content must also be benevolent.  He therefore pooh-poohs the notion that the letter may be intended  for evil purposes, that it may, for example, describe a life form that  will take over the planet as soon as it has materialized. In the ab- sence of any context for the letter, however, Hogarth admits that his  belief in the essential goodness of the Senders is faith, not fact. Al- though there is thus something that can be said about the letter,  some facts and tangible products have been derived from it, its  meaning remains ambiguous. </page> <page sequence="23"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem 137 From this uncertainty comes Hogarth’s severest test of faith. The  occasion arises when Hogarth’s friend and colleague Donald Pro-  thero thinks of subjecting “frog eggs” to the same neutrino wave of  which it is a materialization. Thus the transmission is turned back  on itself, in a circular dialectic reminiscent of the circles-within-cir-  cles that are recurrent structures in the novel. This reflexivity sug- gests that the experiment will be crucial, and it is. The irradiation of  “frog eggs” with the neutrino wave unleashes an awesome energy  that, if projected on a suitably large scale, could turn into a dooms- day weapon. With this discovery, the ethical ambiguities implicit in Hogarth’s  account reach their height. A peace advocate, Hogarth has been sus- picious from the start of the Pentagon’s role in the project. His sus- picion has been reinforced by the physical restrictions placed on the  project’s personnel. When Hogarth joined the project, he perforce  also entered the secret desert compound that housed it. The psycho- logical distaste he feels for the project’s secrecy is manifest in his  claustrophobic physical response to the enclosed compound. But  now he and Prothero find themselves compelled to form a conspir- atorial circle within this larger circle of secrecy, for they know that it  is only a matter of time before someone else also discovers that the  substance can be used to create explosions. As the circles-within-  circles tighten into increasingly oppressive enclosures, the conspira- tors are put in the position of doing exactly what they most fear  others will do— developing the weapon. Their panic about the impli- cations of what they have discovered makes them desperate to find  some way to gain control over the situation. Hogarth fleetingly en- tertains the idea of declaring himself dictator of the planet, using the  weapon to force peace on humanity. He quickly realizes, however,  that such a paradoxical venture would lead only to further oppres- sion and to an even more claustrophobic enclosure. The essence of the trap within which Hogarth finds himself caught  is a context so coercive that it completely determines action, regard- less of individual motives or beliefs. Hogarth has been darkly imag- ining that the Pentagon is funding the project because it hopes that a  weapon will emerge. There is a fine moment when someone suggests  to him that the Pentagon is involved because it is afraid a weapon  may emerge and cannot take the chance that it may not be under its  control. Thus the Pentagon, like Hogarth and Prothero, is shown to </page> <page sequence="24"> 138 Something out of Nothing be the victim of a coercive context that forces it toward global anni- hilation, regardless of what its leaders may or may not want to do. From such subtleties, the picture slowly emerges of an entire soci- ety caught up in a coercive context that determines how its texts will  be read. When Prothero writes to government officials insisting that  information about the project should be shared with the Russians  and proposing that the two nations should work together to crack  the code, his letter serves only to identify him as an object of suspi- cion. The militarists refuse to consider his plan because they are con- vinced that the Russians would only pretend to cooperate, mean- while setting up a second, real team in secret. Prothero is outraged  by this answer. Its probability is indirectly confirmed, however,  when Hogarth discovers that this is exactly what the Pentagon has  done with them. He learns that there is not one project, but two.  “His M aster’s Voice” is shadowed by a second, even more secret  project, appropriately named “His Master’s Ghost” (13:153). The  doubling, with its suggestion of self-reflexivity, emphasizes that the  human text performs as if it were void, emptied of content, when it  is enclosed within a sufficiently coercive context. For Hogarth, being trapped within a context that seems inevitably  to be leading him and everyone else toward global destruction is the  nadir of experience. It is the nightmare of his mother’s death, re- turned and magnified. In a long, drunken wake for humanity, he  and a confidante try to imagine what accidents of fate, what chance  events were fossilized into the history of the race to cause the present  context to emerge. In his antibiography, Hogarth first saw chance as  a way to fight evil, then concluded that chance and necessity were  inextricable. At this moment, chance becomes for Hogarth evil as  well as necessary. The dialectic has become a vicious circle. The way up and out is characteristically a further inversion of,  rather than a retreat from, this conclusion. Unable to escape its coer- cive context, humanity is delivered by what Hogarth interprets as a  triumph of text over context. When the future seems darkest, Pro- thero discovers that the explosion’s accuracy diminishes with range,  so that it is worthless as a weapon. Hogarth comes to believe that  only the mistranslations of earth’s “predatory” science made the  weapon even seem possible. The weapon fails to work, he believes,  because the Senders were able to create a tamperproof text, a mes- </page> <page sequence="25"> Chaos as Dialectic: Stanislaw Lem 139 sage so immune to misinterpretation that not even the coercive con- text of global war could empty it of its benevolent content. Just as  the threat of the doomsday weapon enacted on a magnified scale  Hogarth’s first personal encounter with death, so the Senders’ text  achieves on a cosmic scale the solution Hogarth sought when he  dedicated his life to the study of chance. The Senders deliver human- ity from impending annihilation because they have mastered chance. Are we to endorse this conclusion? As Hogarth admits, it is not  necessarily true. Other explanations are possible. It remains for  Hogarth an act of faith, a belief that ethics can be recuperated be- cause chance can be controlled. But then Hogarth places the control  of chance at the center of his own life as well, so his conclusions  about the neutrino transmission are suspiciously parallel to his con- clusions about his life. It is clear that for Lem, the answer is more  complex than Hogarth, in his optimistic conclusion, wants to be- lieve, for the ambiguities that Hogarth overcomes by an act of faith  are reinforced as the novel draws to a close. The final pages recount what happens when scientists from “His  M aster’s Ghost” arrive to present their interpretations of the neu- trino transmission. Whereas researchers from “His M aster’s Voice”  have been assuming that the neutrino wave is a letter that implies  Senders, those from “His M aster’s Ghost” have been working on the  assumption that the transmission is a message that has form but no  content, or a message that has no sender. These alternative possi- bilities undermine the reader’s faith, if not H ogarth’s, that humanity  is saved because the Senders can control chance. There may be a  voice, or there may be only a ghost. Ethics may emerge from the  void, or it may not. Moreover, the reflexive mirroring between each  project’s name and its conclusions (the Voice project believes there is  a sender, the Ghost project that there is not) reinforces the suspicion  that each project reads itself in the message rather than decodes  whatever is actually there. These self-reflexive mirrorings and the uncertainties they engender  are necessary to make sure that the textual space can never be de- finitively closed. For if the Senders were able to control chance,  might not the cosmos itself someday become an oppressive enclo- sure? Only because the transmission remains enigmatic can the uni- verse be open to both chaos and order, chance and necessity. Only </page> <page sequence="26"> 140 Something out of Nothing because a hole gapes within the center of the text can the necessity  to cease writing be enfolded together with the ongoingness of cre- ation. For Lem, the encounter with chaos is less a celebration than  an ambiguous necessity. The dialectical enfolding of chaos into order serves both as the  mark of Lem’s affinity with his time and as the stamp of his individ- uality. In his concern with chaos and with textual dissemination,  Lem has strong affinities with the new paradigms. Yet in his insis- tence on rational consistency and rigorous extrapolation from  known facts, he can also be seen as very much at odds with the  postmodern temper. To place him at either of these extremes is in an  important sense not to see him at all, for it is from the tension be- tween these polarities that his writing emerges. He is on the cusp of  the transition from the old to the new paradigms but not actually  within either, for he resists the synthesis the new paradigms offer at  the same time that he exposes contradictions that the old did not  recognize. His work testifies that during a paradigm shift, change  arrives not by a single sweeping transformation but by complex  compromises negotiated at specific sites. Lem’s contribution to the twentieth century’s encounter with  chaos is to reveal (perhaps inadvertently) an ambiguity within chaos  theory which has not received the attention it deserves. As I re- marked earlier, chaos theory has a double edge, at once celebrating  chaos’s resistance to rationalization and striving to overcome this  resistance. Lem uses a similar opposition as the basis for his craft. In  this respect he has fully come to terms with an ambiguity that most  chaologists are only beginning to think about. His distinctive  achievement is to use the tension between chaos and order to create  a space for writing that cannot be enclosed even within its own self- erasing confines. We may trace where the dialectic has been by fol- lowing the motion of the pen; but the dialectic itself is never written,  always writing. . . . </page> </plain_text>
